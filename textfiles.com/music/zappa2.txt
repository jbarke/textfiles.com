                         THE COMPLETE FRANK ZAPPA
                           AUDIO-VISUAL CATALOG
                               October 1993
                                 Version 2
                            by Dennis Kiracofe


     Frank Zappa is arguably the most brilliant and avant-garde
musician/composer/sociologist/humorist working today. But because his music
receives little if any radio air-play, most mainstream record stores won't
carry his albums.
     I have compiled this list out of the sheer frustration of trying to
collect all of Frank Zappa's recordings and not knowing just exactly what is
available.
     What follows is the most complete and up-to-date listing that I know of. 
Where available, I have also included the song list of the recording.
     Most or all of these recordings can be obtained directly from Frank
Zappa's mail order company.  Write to:
