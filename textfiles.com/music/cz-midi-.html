----------------- CASIO CZ MIDI GUIDE  condensed version ----------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- or: Everything you Never Wanted to Know about MIDI but are going to ------
------------------- Find Out Anyway -------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        THIS IS AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT CZ101,CZ1000 and CZ5000 OWNERS.

NOTE: I beleive the data given to me by Casio to be a) correct, and b) public
        domain ( since they just give it to you if you are persistent enough.
        Please forgive spelling, syntactic, or grammatical errors since I am
        trying to condense the manual as I go along...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, at long last, I have been able to get a reply out of CASIO UK about the
MIDI standards of the CZ series of synthesizers. For those of you who know
how to play your keyboard by remote control from a computer, this will be of
some interest, since it covers transmission of programming information ( both
to and from the CZ ), setting of the controllers you previously couldn't access
like tone mix level, and other bits besides.

First off, let's recap on the simple stuff. The MIDI is a digital interface to
musical instruments, and relies on serial transmission of data. These data are
usually talked of in terms of bytes, and I shall be using hexadecimal numbers
in this posting.

There are basically two types of bytes sent over MIDI - control bytes and data
bytes. Control bytes are distinguished by having values over 0x80 ( 80 hex, 
128 decimal ), and these have valious meanings:

1) NOTE ON
----------

A note on message consists of sending a "NOTE ON" control byte, the note number
you want to turn on, and the velocity at which you want to play the note. The
note on control is 90 plus the channel number. So, for example, if you want to
play note 32 ( = hex 20) at speed 64 (= hex 40), on the midi instrument receiv-
ing on channel two, then you would send:

        92              20              40
NOTE ON, channel 2      Note #32        Velocity 64

If you wish to turn two or more notes on at the same time, the control byte
need not be retransmitted. Eg to turn note 35 on as well, you could send

        92      20      40      23      40
NOTE ON, ch2    ---32 on--      ---35 on--

These codes can be transmitted both ways on all the CZ 101,1000,5000, but since
they do not detect note velocity, it is always transmitted and recognized as
64 (= 40 hex).

2) NOTE OFF
-----------

Just send a note on message with velocity 0. Eg to turn note 35 off, send

        92      23      00
NOTE ON,Ch 2    --35 off--


3) CONTROL CHANGE
-----------------
There are several controls that can be set from MIDI. Just send a "CONTROL CH"
byte , which is B0 plus the channel number, the number of the control that you
wish to change, then the value you wish to set it to. Eg for CZ101 portamento
time, send

        B0      05      10
CONTROL, ch 0   --ctrl 5=16--

The controls are:

CZ101/1000

01      Vibrato on/off          Send 0 for off, 7F for ON
05      Portamento time         Send number 00..63 (0..99)
06      Master tune             Send number 00..7F
41      Portamento on/off       Send 0 for OFF, 7F for ON

CZ5000

01      Modulation wheel        Send number 00..7F
05      Portamento time         Send number 00..63
06      Master tune             Send number 00..7F
40      Sustain pedal           Send 0 for OFF, 7F for ON
41      Portamento on/off       Send 0 for OFF, 7F for ON

4) PROGRAM CHANGE
-----------------
This allows you to change between the preset sounds ( and your internal
sounds and cartridges ). Just send C0 plus the channel number, then the
program number. Eg to set CZ101 on channel 1 to Synth Bass:

        C1              07
PROGRAM ch 1            Program 7

Note that the preset tones are given numbers :

CZ101/1000

0..0F   Preset sounds 1..16
20..2F  Internal sounds 1..16
40..4F  Cartridge sounds 1..16

CZ5000

00..1F  Preset sounds A1,A2,A3....D6,D7,D8
20..3F  Internal sounds A1,A2.....D6,D7,D8


5) PITCH BEND CHANGE
--------------------

This is acheived by sending E0 plus the channel number, then two bytes 
denoting the new value of pitch bend. The first byte is the most significant,
and the second the least significant. Note also that the lower 6 bits of the
lower byte are not used, and that the central position of the wheel corres-
ponds to the byte sequence 40 00.

        HIGHEST         7F 40

        HIGHER

        CENTER          40 00

        LOWER

        LOWEST          00 00


So, to bend the instrument on channel two UP by about half its maximum amount,
send

        E2              60      00
BEND channel two        ---1/2 up--


6) AFTER TOUCH
--------------
Is not supported on the CZ101/1000/5000. Sorry!

7) MODE CHANGE
--------------
This is very similar to the CONTROL CHANGE message, and can be regarded as a
special case. 

OMNI ON         send E0 + channel, 7D, 00
OMNI OFF        send B0 + channel, 7C, 00
POLY ON         send B0 + channel, 7F, 00
POLY OFF        send B0 + channel, 7E, 00

OMNI mode plays any MIDI data received at the MIDI IN plug on the back of
the machine, regardless of channel. POLY mode is equivalent to the SOLO button
on the front panel. With the CZ101, for instance, POLY OFF ( =SOLO ) allows
the synth to be used as four monophonic synthesizers under remote control.

LOCAL ON        send B0 + channel, 7A, 7F
LOCAL OFF       send B0 + channel, 7A, 00

Local mode means that the keyboard is "connected" to the sound producing 
part of the CZ within the machine itself. With LOCAL ON ( the default setting ),
playing the keyboard both sends note messages out of the MIDI port, and also
makes sounds at the same time. If you want to do wierd things like keyboard
splitting, LOCAL OFF will allow you to see what the keyboard is doing without
the CZ making any sound at all. You could then act on that information and send
the keyboard a command depending on the keys that has nothing to do with them,
eg program change or pitch bend. The possibilities are endless !


SEQUENCER MESSAGES
------------------
The CZ5000 has its own internal sequencer, which can be controlled by:

F8      Clock byte: transmitted 24 times per quarter note ( crotchet )
FA      Start: same as pressing the PLAY button on the front panel
FB      Continue: continue song where last stopped
FC      Stop: stops song play at current position
FD      Active sense: basically, a cry of "Is there anybody out there". If no
        reply is received within about 1/3 second, it shuts the voice off.


SYSTEM EXCLUSIVE MESSAGES
-------------------------

At last, the really meaty stuff. :-)

These all have the basic form:

        F0      machine ID      some bytes      F7
SYS EX MESSG    YES, YOU        DO THIS         END OF SYS EX

Ok, so not very specific, bu that was deliberate to allow manufacturers to use
all the lovely bells and whistles they put on their machine over the MIDI !

Since these are usually controlled by computer, I have set them out as a
computer/synthesizer dialogue. Note that the computer MUST wait for replies
before proceding, or all will fail !

Here we go, then 

1) SET BEND RANGE
-----------------

Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 40 data F7

Eg to set bend range to 8 on channel 4, send
                F0 44 00 00 74 40 08 F7

2) KEY TRANSPOSE
----------------

Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 41 data F7

Data is as follows:
Key:    G  A  A# B  B# C  C# D  E  E# F  F#
Data:   45 44 43 41 41 00 01 02 03 04 05 06

Eg to set key on channel 0 to C#, send
                F0 44 00 00 70 41 01 F7

3) TONE MIX
-----------

Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 42 data F7

The data is 00 to turn tone mix off, or 41..49 for mix level 1..9

Eg to set tone mix on channel 0 to 7, send
                F0 44 00 00 70 42 47 F7

4) ASK ABOUT PROGRAMMER ( Send request 2 )
-----------------------

Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 19 00
CZ101/1000:     F0 44 00 00 70+channel 30
Computer:       70+channel 31
CZ101/1000:     data1 data2 F7
Computer:       F7

data1 is the program selected ( see PROGRAM CHANGE )
data2 returns the vibrato/portamento on/off setting:

data2   00      10      20      30
Vibrato OFF     OFF     ON      ON
Port'o  OFF     ON      OFF     ON

Eg an exchange such as
Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70 19 00            "Want data on channel 0"
CZ101:          F0 44 00 00 70 30               "Gotcha.. data ready"
Computer:       70 31                           "Ok, give it to me"
CZ101:          27 30 F7                        "Internal 8, v on, p on"
Computer:       F7

REMOTE PROGRAMMING
------------------
The send request 1 and receive request 1 messages.

These dump a lot of data across the MIDI, which is the same for both messages,
except that the data go the other way. The exchanges are:

Send request
Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 10 program
CZ101/1000:     F0 44 00 00 70+channel 30
Computer:       70+channel 31
CZ101/1000:     <tone data> F7
Computer:       F7

Receive request
Computer:       F0 44 00 00 70+channel 20 program
CZ101/1000:     F0 44 00 00 70+channel 30
Computer:       <tone data> F7
Cz101/1000:     F7

The program byte is the same as that set by the PROGRAM CHANGE function, with
the addition that you can request the temporary sound area as well ( number is
60 ). This is the area that is used if you have altered a preset and not saved
it into internal memory.

<tone data> is a sequence of 256 bytes containing a LOT of info. Now Casio have
done a lot of funny things with these, like splitting bytes in half and encoding
things in wierd ways so please bear with me.

To keep everything this side of infinite length, I shall adopt the same strategy
as the manual, which is to write data in bytes, although they are transmitted
in half- bytes. For example, me writing a byte as 5F requires you to transmit or
receive as 0F 05 ( wierd, huh ? ). This will obvoiusly save a lot of space.

So, here goes again :-)

There are 25 distinct sections within <tone data>

Sec#    Length  Symbol          Contents
        (bytes)

1       1       pflag           line select data, octave range
2       1       pds             detune up or down
3       2       pdl,pdh         detune range
4       1       pvk             vibrato wave number
5       3       pvdld,pvdlv     vibrato delay time
6       3       pvsd,pvsv       vibrato rate
7       3       pvdd,pvdv       vibrato depth
8       2       mfw             dco1 waveform

10      2       mwmd,mwmv       dcw1 key follow
11      1       pmal            end step number of dca1 envelope
12      16      pma             dca1 envelope rate/level
13      1       pmwl            end step number of dcw1 envelope
14      16      pmw             dcw1 envelope rate/level
15      1       pmpl            end step number of dco1 envelope
16      16      pmp             dco1 envelope rate/level

20      1       psal            end step number of dca2 envelope
21      16      psa             dca2 rate/level
22      1       pswl            end step number of dcw2 envelope
23      16      psw             dcw2 rate/level
24      1       pspl            end step number of dco2 envelope
25      16      psp             dco2 rate/level

1) PFLAG
Looking at bits,
        0000  00   00
 Not used^   OCTV  LS

OCTV controls octave range: 00=octave 0, 01=+1, 10=-1

LS is the line select: 00=1, 01=2, 10=1+1', 11=1+2'

So, fo Octave +1, line select 1+1', PFLAG=00000110 = 06

2)PDS
For detune +, PDS is 0, for detune - it is 01

3)PDETL,PDETH

Two bytes controlling the depth of the detune.
The first byte is the FINE data.

FINE:   0..15   16..30  31..45  46..60
Byte:   00..0F  11..1F  21..2F  31..3F

The second contains both the octave and note data:

OCT:    0       1       2       3
NOTE:   0..11   0..11   0..11   0..11
Byte:   00..0B  0C..17  18..23  24..2F


4) PVK

This is the vibrato wave number, encoded as follows

WAVE NUMBER:    1       2       3       4
Byte:           08      04      20      02

5) PVDLD,PVDLV

This is the vibrato delay time, transmitted in three bytes.

Delay   Bytes           Delay   Bytes           Delay   Bytes

For delays in the range 0..31, just transmit 00..1F, 00, 00..1F eg for delay
of 12, send 0C 00 0C. This is convenient since it saves me typing in another
column of boring numbers ;-)

6) PVSD,PVSV

Again, here comes another table for conversions. The first column (0..24) is
omitted since the only difficult thing needed is to add 01 00 20 to each entry

7) PVDD,PVDV

These are again encoded as three bytes in a most obscure way. Below 32, the
encoding is 00..1F, 00, 01..20 eg for depth 13, send 0D 00 0E.

8) MFW

These two bytes transmit the waveform for DCO1, and also the modulation ie
ring, noise or none.

                First byte      Second byte
                000 000 0  0  00 000 000

First=1         000        0  00
Fisrt=2         001        0  00
First=3         010        0  00
First=4         100        0  00
First=5         101        0  00
First=6         110        0  01
First=7         110        0  10
First=8         110        0  11
Second=1            000 1  0  00
Second=2            001 1  0  00
Second=3            010 1  0  00
Second=4            100 1  0  00
Second=5            101 1  0  00
Second=6            110 1  0  01
Second=7            110 1  0  10
Second=8            110 1  0  11
NO MODULATION                    000
RING MODULATION                  100
NOISE MODULATION                 011

So, for instance, to set first = 4, second= 2, ring modulation, we have

        100 001 1 0 00 100 000 = 1000 0110 0010 0000 = 86 20

9) MAMD,MAMV

These two bytes set the DCA1 key follow:

Key follow:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
1st byte:       00  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09
2nd byte:       00  08  11  1A  24  2F  3A  45  52  5F


10) MWMD, MWMV

These two bytes set the DCW1 key follow

Key follow:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
1st byte:       00  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09
2nd byte:       00  1F  2C  39  46  53  60  6E  92  FF


11) PMAL

This sets the position of the end step on DCA1. Step 1..8 gives bytes 00..07.

12) PMA

This consists of 8 repetitions of Rate,Level.

Given that you wish to set rate r, the data you need to send is

        Byte= 119 x r
              -------
                99
Conversely, if byte=0, rate=0, if byte=7F, rate=99, otherwise

        r=99 x byte
          --------- + 1
             119

Add 80 hex if the level will be coming down on this step.

The level goes up linearly, with 0 being 00, up to 99 is 7F, so that

        Byte= 127 x level
              -----------
                 99

and     Level= 99 x byte
               --------- + 1
                  127

except at byte=0 where level=0, and byte=127, where level=99

In all these conversions, fractional parts are ignored, so a result of
byte=24.6987 would be taken as byte=24.

13) PMWL

End step number for DCW1. Same as PMAL


14) PMW

This sets the steps in DCW1, and consists of 8 repetitions of Rate,Level.
The format is similar to PMA, so that you add 80 ( 128 dec ) to the rate if
the level is coming down this step, and that you add 80 to the level if you
wish to set a sustain point. The level data is handled the same as PMA, but 
for some strange reason the rate data is encoded differently.

So      byte= 119 x level
              ----------- + 8
                  99

and     level= 99 x (byte-8)
               ------------- +1
                    119

except where byte=8, level=0, and where byte=77, level=99

15) PMPL

Another end step setting, this time for DCO1. Same as PMAL and PMWL

16) PMP

Another envelope setting, this time for the DCO1 rates and levels. Again uses a
completely different encoding scheme.

        byte= 127 x rate
              ----------
                  99
and
        rate= 99 x byte
              --------- + 1
                 127

except where byte=00, rate=0, where byte=7F, rate=99

For the level, level data 0..63 translate as bytes 00..3F, and level data
64..99 translate as bytes 44..67.

17) SFW

These two bytes set the waveform for DCO2. They use the same format as MFW
does for DCO1, except that the modulation bits are ignored ( it is best to set
these bits to zero , just in case ).

18) SAMD,SAMV
19) SWMD,SWMV
20) PSAL
21) PSA
22) PSWL
23) PSW
24) PSPL
25) PSP

All the above use the same formats as their counterparts for the first set of
DCO,DCW,DCA, and perform exactly the same functions on the DCA2,DCW2,and DCO2.



This concludes what I hope has been an informative article ( if rather a long
one :-)  ).
