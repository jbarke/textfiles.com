          Wired explores where the leading edge of technology is leading
          and driving our culture. Wired not only shows the latest gizmos
          and gadgets, but tries to discover what changes our society is
          going to undergo because of these gizmos and gadgets. Very hip,
          great artwork, excellent writing. ($45/year overseas). Reviewed
