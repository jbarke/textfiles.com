Finally it's here, - the discography! I've worked with this (and is still 
doing...), but it has taken time... But now I'm "finished"! I KNOW this 
list is missing _A_LOT_ of releases! I also have more info. which I haven't 
updated in the list yet! But I decided to post it now, so we can get 
something to talk about. (We need that!) 

So I hope you help me (us) to add stuff to this list. And maybe there is 
typing errors or other errors in it. And it's missing a lot of info. 

If you know, let me know! But, please cut out the lines you want to correct! 
Else I receive the whole list in every message from you, and that's many 
Bytes! And please send me only sure information. (Not "I think...., but 
I'll check it out!" - Check it out before you send it!) 
And it takes time to update it, so don't expect me to post it updated this 
week! But I'll try to post an updated version once a week! 

This includes 224 releases!

ENJOY!
