....Into The Lungs of Hell

  <Instrumental>


....Set The World Afire

Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky...
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie...
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb...
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun...

Distorted figures walk the street, It's 1999...
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines...
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face...
No time to change your fate, no time left, It's too late...

The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid they said...
And if it comes, The living will envy the dead...
Racing for power, and all come in last...
No winning first stone cast
This falsehood worldly peace...

Its treaties soon will cease...
No one will be left to prove that humans exsisted...
Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted...
we all live on one planet, it will all go up in smoke...

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy...
and now the final scene a global darkening...

Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins...
Towering overhead both far and wide...
There's unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said `We'll use rocks on the other side`
No survivors set the world Afire...


....Anarchy in the UK

Right now!
I am and Anti-Christ!
and I am an anarchist...
Don't know what i want, but I know to get it...!
I want to destroy, Possibly?!!

Cause I want to be Anarchy. No dog's body...
It's coming sometime it maybe...
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light...
Your future dream is a shopping spree...

Cause i want to be Anarchy, In the City...

Of many ways to get what you want...
I use the best, I use the rest...
I use the enemy...
I use Anarchy...

Cause i want to be Anarchy! Its the only way to be!!!

Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Is this the U.D.A.?
Is this the I.R.A.?

I thought it was the U.S.A., or just another country...
and other cunt-like tendencies...
Cause I want to be Anarchy...Cause I..Want to be...Anarchy!
You know what I mean?!
Cause I want to be an Anarchist, Again I'm Pissed,
DESTROY!!!


....Mary Jane

Forgive me father for I have sinned...
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch to the wind...
And I'm still wide awake... Mary Jane!

From the earth, up through the trees...
I can hear her calling me...
Her voice rides on the breeze...
Oh, It's haunting me...

No, I can't get away...
No, there's no escape...
If I know I'm going crazy...
I must not be insane...

Beware my friends, as you pass by...
As you are now, so once was I
As I am now so you must be...
Prepare, my friends, to follow me!

Forgive me father, for I have sinned...
I'm a child of the air, a witch of the wind...
Fingers gripped around my brain...
No control, my mind is lame...
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same...
Never, Never, Never, Never, Never, Never, Never, Never, Never!!

Beware my friends, as you pass by...
As you are now, so once was I...
As i am now so you must be...
Prepare, my friends, to follow me!

it hurts so bad, I can't breathe...
Prepare to follow me!!!


....502
  
Pull-over, shithead, this is the cops...

Full tank, pockets lined with cash...
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass...
Drive all day, and through the night,
Romance the road, winding left to right...

  The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free...
  A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see...

Driving fast makes me feel good,
The speed of light trapped under my hood!
Breaking laws, 'cause there's nothing to do...
Driving the interstate, stopped... for a 502!

Hundreds of miles rolled off today...
Signs lose their meanings, Minutes tick away...
Dirt roads to interstates...I must have drove them all...
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol...

  Drive until daybreak, always on the go...
  Life on the freeway, Night shift till dawn patrol...

Driving fast makes me feel good...
Speed of light trapped under my hood!
Breaking laws 'cause theres nothing to do...
Driving the interstate, Stopped...for a 502!
Stopped for a 502, next time its gonna be you!

Stars above guide me...
This feeling inside me...
I drive until daybreak...
Life on the freeway is hell!
I'm coming through!!


...In My Darkest Hour

In my hour of need...
ha! no, you're not there...
and though i reached out for you...
wouldn't lend a hand!

Through the darkest hour...
grace did not shine on me...
it feels so cold, very cold...
No one cares for me!
 
Did you ever think i get lonely?
Did you ever think i needed love?
did you ever think to stop thinking
youre the only one im thinking of?!

You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too!

   Things will be better...better... when I'm dead and gone!
     don't try to understand, knowing you... I'm probably wrong!

But oh how I lived my life for you...
still you'd turn away!
Now as I die for you,
my flesh still crawls as I breathe your name...
All these years I thought I was wrong...
now I know it was you!
Raise your head! raise your face! your eyes....
tell me who you think you are, who?!

   I walk...I walk alone...
   into the promised land...

There's a better place for me!
But its far...far away!
Everlasting life for me,
In a perfect world...!
But I gotta die first,
please god... send me on my way!

Time has a way of taking time...
Loneliness is not only felt by fools!
Alone i call to ease the pain...
Yearning to be held by you! Alone... so alone! I'm lost...
Consumed by the pain...!
the pain...the pain...the pain...!

Won't you hold me again...?
you just laughed..ha ha, bitch!
my whole life is work built on the past...
but the time has come when all... things shall pass...
this good thing passed away...!

In my darkest hour...!


...Liar
   
You take great pride in never having lived up to anything!
Lie! Steal! cheat and kill...! A real bad guy!
Your daddy us a wino, and your mommy is quite insane!
From altar boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn!
Your sister's a junkie, gets it anyway she can!
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band!
Your girlfriend's got herpes to with your hep and AIDS!
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet!

Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes...
your face is replaced, a creature you dispise...
but I know what you're made of, it ain't much, I'm afraid!
I know you'll be lying until your dying day!

Make up your stories, the truth's so hard to say...
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave!
Your mind is sick from Alzheimer's Disease...
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories!

    You're a liar! liar! lie...Everyone can see!
    liar! liar! lie! It's all you'll ever be!
    liar! liar! liar! It's what you mean to me!
    liar! liar! lies!
    
Start trouble... spread pain...
Piss and venom... in your veins! 
Talk nasty... Breathe fire...
smell rotten...You're a liar!
Sweat liquor... breathe snot...
Eat garbage... spit blood...
Diseased... health hazard...
Scum bag... filthy bastard...
Greasy face... tooth decay...
Hair matted... drunk all day...
Absessed... sunken veins...
Rot gut... scrambled brain...
Steal money... crash cars...
rob jewlery... hock guitars...
Rot in hell, its time you know!
to your master... off you go!

You're a liar!
A fucking liar...
Filthy liar!
Liar...
you... you...you fucking liar!
You're a liar...



...Hook In Mouth

A cockrach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes...
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truth into great lies...
A little man with a big eraser...Changing history!
Procedures that he's programmed to... all he hears and sees...

Altering the facts and figures... events and every issue!
Make a person disappear... No one will ever miss you!

rewrites every story... every poem that ever was...
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws...
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules!
Replacing rights with wrongs... the files and records in the schools...

You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway?!
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?!
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come!
I believe my kingdom will come!

F is for fighting... R is for red...
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed!
E, we elect them... E, we eject them...
In the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
D for your dying... O, your overture...
M, they will cover your grave with manure...
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me...
As long as there's a P.M.R.C. !

F is for fighting... R is for red...

Put your hand right up my shirt...
Pull the strings that make me work...
jaws will part, words fall out...
like a fish...with hook in mouth!    

Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was...
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws...
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules!
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools...
 
I'm not a fish!
I'm a man!
HOOK...IN...MOUTH!
