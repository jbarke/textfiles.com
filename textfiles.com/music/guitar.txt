 I NOTICED THAT IN ALL THE TIME I'VE SPENT DOWNLOADING TEXT FILES, I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE DEALING WITH UBJECT OF GUITAR PLAYING. SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS WRITE MY OWN. THIS CHAPTER WILL DEAL MAINLY WITH H AIS.
 FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST KNOW THAT THE RANGE OF THE HUMAN EAR IS LIMITED TO A SPECTRUM OF FREQUENCIES.CTAVE IS A MEASUREMENT OF SOUND WITHIN THIS LIMITED RANGE. THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF AN OCTAVE SEGT"DIATONIC" NOTES. HOWEVER, AS ANYBODY CAN SEE

 THE WORD "SHARP" MEANS SIMPLY ONE NOTE ABOVE AND IS DESIGNATED BY THIS SYMBOL #. THE WORD FLAT MEAN NOTE BELOW AND IS DESIGNATED BY A SYMBOL THAT UNFORNTUNATLY CAN'T BE REPRODUCED BY THE COMPUTERBTLOS ALMOST LIKE A SMALL B WITH A LITTLE MORE FL

 I WILL NOW TRY TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THE NOTES ARE SET UP ON A PIANO BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD VISUAL EXAMF HOW THE OCTAVE REPEATS ITSELF.

 THE "*" REPRESENT THE BLACK KEYS THE WHITE KEYS ARE REPRESENTED BY THE  "!!". I HAD TO DOUBLE THE LS OF THE NOTES SO THIS SHITTY DIAGRAM WOULD LOOK DECENT. BUT YOU GET THE POINT.
 NOW I WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU A DIAGRAM OF THE FRETBOARD AND THE NOTES.
