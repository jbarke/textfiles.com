               [Netscape Now!]  The Horn Players' FAQ [Image]

This is version 0.54 of the Horn Players' FAQ, last        [Yamaha YHR667D]
modified on 03 Sep 97, 16:21:32 CDT. Maintainer of the
FAQ is Ron Boerger, rboerger@io.com, aka TheHornist@aol.com .. this document
is copyrighted; see here for more information.

First, a note about what this FAQ is, and is not. It is a collection of
commonly-asked questions about the French Horn. It does NOT represent the
views of the International Horn Society (IHS), although I am a member of
that group. Originally, this FAQ was designed to handle questions that
cropped up frequently on what used to be the IHS' Horn e-mail list.
Nowadays, it is just the Horn mailing list, as membership is open to any and
all. In a like vein, once you have joined the mailing list, you are NOT a
member of the IHS! To join the IHS, please see the entry below on the IHS
itself.

This FAQ is the sole external reference cited by Encyclopedia Britannica
Online regarding the [French] Horn :-) It (in somewhat modified form) was
also selected as a "Hot Link of the Week" [Brass Instruments] by Music
Interactive.

The master location for this FAQ is
http://www.io.com/~rboerger/Hornfaq.html. A plain text version is stored at
http://www.io.com/~rboerger/plaindocs/horn.faq, and this version may also be
obtained via ftp at ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/rboerger/horn.faq.

1. Why isn't this formatted in HTML (for you WWW users)

It is, thanks to Bill Muth, who tired of reading in in plaintext. ;-)

                               ---------------

2. Is it "french" horn?

Only in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. is the horn known as the
"french" horn. Most European literature deems the instrument simply "horn"
[cor, etc.] and most purists follow that nomenclature. It's a sad fact,
however, that in the US, outside of the music community, telling someone
that you play horn will usually elicit a "Oh? What kind of horn,
trumpet?"-type response. We won't even go into the disgusting habit that
saxophone players have of calling their instruments "horns". Look, guys,
this is a reed, and therefore it's not a horn of any kind!

For what it's worth, the International Horn Society's official opinion is
that it is the Horn that we all play.

Marilyn Kloss (mkloss@mga.com) adds:

> I thought it was in Britain where the term originated, of course carried
> over here.  I agree with your writer that it is frustrating and annoying
> that people in general don't know what a "horn" is.  Actually, try talking
> to the general public about "English horn" and see what you get!

Seth Urion (SURION@VAX2.Winona.MSUS.EDU) relates Barry Tuckwell's thoughts:

> The name for the instrument in English speaking countries, meaning England,
> came from the fact that hunting horns differed greatly from England to the
> continent, France in particular.  While French hunting horns were large,
> worn over the shoulder, and looked roughly similar to what we now call
> simply a "hunting horn", British hunting horns were much smaller, say ten
> inches in diameter, held in a single hand, and pitched signifigantly higher.
> Thus, to differentiate between what the Brits' called a "horn" and the
> larger thing we call a "horn", the larger modern instrument was given the
> prefix "French", as it reminded them of the continental hunting horn.
> This also explains why the continental types don't call it anything but a horn.

Finally [!], from Alan Cole (AlanCarolC@aol.com) comes musings from
long-time hornist Glen Wren:

> 1.  The Horn, often incorrectly referred to as the "French Horn" was not
> developed in France, but in the Alps of the Germanic countries, commonly used
> to warn animal intruders who threatened the shepherd's flock.  The instrument
> was constructed entirely of wood and straw, and the conical designed
> mouthpiece was also wooden.  Since those sparse beginnings, the Horn went
> through a miriad of changes in order to make it more appropriate to play
> diatonically, but , for some unknown reason, kept its conical bore design
> which gave it the unique tone quality we identify as the Horn sound.  Since
> the French dominated most of the Alpine region during this developmental
> stage of the horn, the term "French Horn" became a popular term which has
> stuck with us 'til this day.  Bottom line, the "Horn" should never be called
> a "French Horn," unless you are speaking with the uninformed public, or don't
> want to get involved in a heated discussion because you are busy dumping out
> the spit, and only have 8 measures of rest to do so.

3. What is a FAQ?

Among the Usenet and Internet community, it soon became obvious after the
first common mailing lists/newsgroups were established, the same questions
would come up over and over again. This becomes annoying after a while .. so
the tradition of the FAQ evolved. A FAQ (which stands for Frequently Asked
Questions) is a list of commonly asked questions and answers to those
questions, and is sent out periodically to the mailing list membership. This
reduces traffic to *new* and hopefully *exciting* questions.

FAQs are not meant to be static documents. If you have a correction, or
suggestion for the FAQ, please send it to THE FAQ MAINTAINER, not the
mailing list. Contributors' names and email addresses will be listed in the
FAQ unless they state otherwise.

This FAQ is sent out on the 1st of each month. Comments should be sent to
Ron Boerger, rboerger@io.com. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE LIST;
see item 4 below.

4. What is the Hornists' Mailing List?

The International Horn Society (IHS) has, for a period of time, "sponsored"
this list as a means for horn players to communicate with one another on
topics of interest to the horn community in general. Any sort of question,
announcement, or posting that involves the horn is appropriate for this
group. It is NOT, however, a place to discuss general music theory, brass
ensembles, or other topics that do not have relevance to horn players.

Although membership was originally (Feb 1994) limited to those hornists who
were members of the IHS, that restriction was lifted in May, 1994. Now, all
you have to do is be interested in horn to be added to the email list.
Rumour has it there's even a saxophone player on the distribution somewhere.

We have all levels of hornists on the distributions; professional hornists,
teachers of the instrument, student hornists, semi-pros and people who just
enjoy playing (or listening to) the horn. You don't have to do this for a
living to join the group!

You will also get more information when you subscribe to the list. A copy of
this info may be obtained by sending the text "info horn" as the body of a
message to " majordomo@spock.nlu.edu".

a. How do I subscribe to the mailing list?

Simply send a message to " majordomo@spock.nlu.edu". The body of your
message should state the following, EXACTLY:

     subscribe horn
     end

After you send this message, you will receive a reply from the list server;
after this point, you're on the horn mailing list!

A digest form of the list is now available! This lets list subscribers
receive a single message per day with all postings for that day concatenated
together. Many people find digests less obtrusive than 10 or 20 messages
daily, especially if they are getting their email at work. To subscribe to
the digest, send the message below to majordomo@spock.nlu.edu:

        subscribe horn-digest
        end

If you're already signed up for the horn list, you'll need to unsubscribe
from it first, and then resubscribe as the instructions above state
(actually, you can just send one message with three lines; one to
unsubscribe from horn, one to subscribe to the digest as above, and an end
line).

If you have friends that might be interested, PLEASE GIVE THEM THIS
INFORMATION; administrative requests such as this should NOT go to the horn
distribution itself.

b. How do I send a message to the mailing list?

Compose your message with your choice of mailer, then send it to:

     horn@spock.nlu.edu

If you think of it, putting HORN: in the subject line might help some people
filter the messages. Your subject line should be descriptive so that those
of us who receive literally hundreds of messages per day can easily decide
if they want to take the time to look at the body.

c. Who do I send questions to about the mailing list?

If you have questions about how the list is administered, whether or not you
are getting mail, or other administrative questions, they should go to Dr.
Greene (MUGREENE@ALPHA.NLU.EDU). Questions about the FAQ should go to
rboerger@io.com. Questions about postings to the list should be directed to
the originator of the posting, unless you feel that your question has
interest to the entire group; in this case, post your question to
horn@spock.nlu.edu.

d. Can I send mail about other musical instruments to this mailing list?

Generally not; this list is for horn-specific topics, although occasionally
we may touch on other things in the course of a horn question. See items 7 &
8 below for some other mailing lists that may be of interest.

e. How do I cancel my list membership?

Send a message consisting of the text, "unsubscribe horn", to
majordomo@spock.nlu.edu. You will get a confirmation that your membership in
the list has been terminated by your request. Naturally, if you subscribed
to the digest, send unsubscribe horn-digest instead. In either case, you'll
have to unsubscribe from the same email address that you subscribed from ..
majordomo has no way of knowing that your new, different address is for the
same person as your old one.

Again, we ask that you do NOT send a cancel request to the horn mailing list
itself.

5. The IHS

a. What is the IHS?

The International Horn Society [IHS] was formed in June of 1970 for the
purpose of furthering knowledge about the Horn and its literature, as well
as to promote communications among its players. These goals now extend into
virtually every aspect of the instrument itself, its literature, and the
techniques by which we can better communicate as musicians.

The Society has something to offer every player or Horn enthusiast. For
those interested in technique, there are articles in the HORN CALL (the IHS
Journal), and lectures, master classes, and clinics at its workshops. For
those interested in literature and performance, there are music and record
reviews in the HORN CALL plus recitals and exhibits at the workshops. If you
are someone interested in knowing more about the physical aspects of the
instrument, there have been several major acoustical studies reported in the
HORN CALL, and it is possible to speak directly with many of the Hornmakers
who exhibit at the workshops.

In addition, you will receive details and scholarly research stuides
pertaining to the Horn as published in the Society's refereed journal, The
Horn Call Annual. Members also receive an annual Directory listing the
membership of the IHS. Four Newsletters are published each year to keep the
membership informed of immediate horn news and activities.

For the rest ... there is a communication (and a commiseration) - which
replenished the spirit, restores the faith, and renews the determination to
be a stronger player and a better musician.

The IHS is more than an organization, it is an opportunity to participate in
the very best of what the Horn has to offer. Please join us.

b. Aims and Purposes

The purpose of this society shall be to promote musical education with
particular reference to the horn. In pursuit of its aims and purposes, the
Society and its members:

   * Hold and encourage workshops, lectures, and seminars open to the
     public.
   * Publish a Journal consisting of materials appropriate to the horn, as
     well as periodic newsletters and membership lists.
   * Encourage the awarding of grants and scholarships to competition
     winners.
   * Encourage composers and arrangers to write music featuring the horn.
   * Foster competitions for and the commissioning of new repertoire
     featuring the horn.
   * Establish and foster an Archives/Research Facility pertaining to the
     horn and horn playing.
   * Establish close working relationships with music teachers.
   * Present honors and recognition for distinctive service relating to the
     horn.

c. How can I join?

d. When is the Next IHS Conference?

The 1998 International Horn Summit will be held 2-8 June, 1998, in Banff,
Alberta, Canada. The triumvirate of Froydis Ree Werke, David Hoyt (Edmonton
Symphony), and Isobel Moore Rolston (Banff Centre) will co-host the event.

The conference already has a basic URL, at:

http://www.banffcentre.ab.ca/Music/horn.html

The 1999 Conference will likely be held somewhere in Europe, although there
is a certain amount of sentiment for it to be held in China. The IHS is
actively seeking bids from those interested in hosting the event.

For those wondering why seemingly many of the IHS conferences are held in
North America, it has been because bids from other locations to hold the
conference have been few and far between. Want to have a conference in your
country? Contact the IHS.

What goes on at an IHS conference? Follow this link to read "Reports from
Rochester", an unofficial summary of each day's goings-on at the 1997
conference.

e. Does the IHS have a web site? Where is it?

Yes!! The IHS' official site is on-line at http://www.wmich.edu/horn. It is
a fact-filled, visually pleasing site created by Bruce Hebmd, a.k.a.
"Horndog" and creator of the Thomas Bacon home page. You can get complete
information about the IHS by visiting this wonderful site.

8. Are there any other musical mailing lists or newsgroups?

There are many "usenet news groups" on the topic of music. As of May 1995,
here is a list of some "music" related newsgroups:

        rec.music.cd
        rec.music.christian
        rec.music.classical
        rec.music.classical.performing
        rec.music.compose
        rec.music.info
        rec.music.makers
        rec.music.makers.bands
        rec.music.makers.marketplace
        rec.music.makers.percussion
        rec.music.makers.french-horn
        rec.music.makers.trumpet
        rec.music.marketplace
        rec.music.misc
        rec.music.movies
        rec.music.reviews
        rec.music.video

Please note: These are just a few of the groups that are available.

There are also mailing lists available for other instruments. As we find out
about them, they will be added to the list.

The canonical USENET list of musical mailing lists can be obtained by any of
the following methods:

via finger ayukawa@server.berkeley.edu

by sending email to lomml@arastar.com; no special commands are required;

via anonymous FTP at:
   ftp://server.berkeley.edu/pub/misc/lomml
   ftp://ftp.uwp.edu/pub/music/misc/mail.lists.music

on the World Wide Web (WWW) in plaintext at:

9. Is there a horn newsgroup?

A recent CFD/CFV for the group rec.music.makers.french-horn was submitted
and passed by C. J. Liotta. While I personally find the name of the group
anaethema, it has passed according to all the guidelines and the group has
been propogated. It is unclear at this point if the newsgroup and the
mailing list will ever be tied together; the amount of traffic on the
newgroup is perhaps 10-20% that of the mailing list.

10. How do I get to the newsgroup?

It's really beyond the scope of this document to tell you how to get the
newsgroup, because there are so many different systems. If you are using a
newsreader such as rn, trn, etc, you can subscribe by entering the command,
"grec.music.makers.french-horn". If you are on AOL, you will have to use the
"Expert Add" command under "Newsgroups", and just enter
"rec.music.makers.french-horn" at the prompt. Other news browsers should
have similar mechanisms.

If, after entering the correct subscription command, *and* the correct
newsgroup name, you get a message stating something like "no such
newsgroup", talk the the people responsible for administering your system
about manually adding the group. Some sites do not automatically add all
newsgroups, even ones validly created such as r.m.m.f-h.

11. What are the names/addresses of horn manufacturers?

If you are thinking about buying a new horn, and are unsure where to start,
you may want to look at "So, you want to buy a new horn?", a somewhat
irreverent but hopefully useful compendium on information on the topic.

12. What are the names/addresses of horn dealers and suppliers?

There are many fine local music stores which can give you the chance to try
out horns, and it is not the intent of this item to direct you away from
those. However, for a major purchase such as a horn (which can easily exceed
US $5000), mail order shops may give you a substantial discount, since at
least taxes are not usually payable from them. You may want to consider them
for this reason. Some of these include:

14. What music is available for horn ensemble?

You name it, someone's likely to have transcribed it. The key is to find
it... the above can usually send you a catalog.

In addition, it's often pretty easy to transcribe music written for brass
ensemble to horn ensemble; of course, you should contact the copyright owner
of the brass ensemble arrangement for legal specifics.

16. Where can I get my horn repaired?

Oh, boy. Is THIS a loaded question, or what? We'll, let's give it a shot ..

Most horn players should be be able to perform basic maintenance on their
instruments. This would include such things as cleaning the instrument,
oiling valves, restringing valves, changing spit valve corks, and so forth.
Local music shops should be able to assist with these items, and your fellow
hornists are usually more than glad to help as well.

For more major repairs (overhauls, dent removal, etc.) you probably want to
take your instrument to a known reputable repair shop, as improper repairs
can severely damage the instrument, sometimes irrevocably. If you are
fortunate enough to have a "custom" horn, you may want to either send the
instrument back to the manufacturer, or ask the manufacturer for a referral.
Many of the more skilled repair shops listed below will have some degrees of
familiarities with many makes of horns - you might ask them if they've ever
worked on an Alexander, for example.

As everything else in the FAQ, these listings have been provided by your
fellow musicians and are provided without any warranties, express, implied,
or otherwise.

Many thanks to Carol Schurr for suggesting this section.

17. How can I improve my:

   * range: Practice.
   * endurance: Practice lots.
   * tone quality: ??
   * technique: Practice lots of hard stuff. :-)

At one point, I was soliciting suggestions for this section, but it's now my
opinion that you should find a horn instructor to work with you on these
items. Each player is different, and it's rare that any pat advice will work
for all people. A teacher can listen to your current playing, evaluate it
for strengths and weaknesses, and make suggestions based on their training
and experience. As I am just a player "at" the instrument, rather than a
student/teacher of it, I'm not qualified to offer real advice here. In any
case, young students may find this fingering chart useful. Also, Robin
Moffatt's Horn Mailing List Archive has a number of suggestions on improving
your playing ability.

18. How do I find out about

   * a. full-time positions with symphonies, etc.
   * b. part-time or "one-shot" gigs

[Image] ClassicWeb Horn Jobs contains a detailed list, with links, of horn
positions. It seems to be primarily non-US, but that may just be all they
had when I visited.

[Image] Another good site containing many links to general music jobs is
that of Indiana University's "Worldwide Internet Music Resources" Music Jobs
page. You can find all sorts of positions through the links listed here.

A net-accessible site containing music jobs (and others) within US colleges
is located at gopher://chronicle.merit.edu/aa/.ads. Note this is a gopher
site. Other sites containing music-related employment information include
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs and Employment Searches. Eric W. Nicklas, maintainer)

A general employment web page can be found at
http://www-marine.wr.usgs.gov:80/docs/jobs.html. There are many employment
links of all sorts from here.

The American Federation of Musicians monthly newsletter, International
Musician, usually has many professional US horn positions posted in it.
Union members get it as part of their benefits package. For more
information, write:

        American Federation of Musicians
        1501 Broadway
        New York, NY 10036 USA

Subscriptions for non-AFM members are US$20, CDN$25, and US$30 for all other
"foreign".

One-shots are largely a function of (a) how well you play, (b) how available
you are, often on short notice, and (c) who you know. Churches are a
starting point as they always seem to need brass players on short notice,
and often are willing/able to pay for non-members to come in and play. Don't
underemphasize the importance of networking with your fellow musicians.

There are sometimes musicians' bulletin boards (computer or real) in larger
communities where the arts are active, and you may be able to find audition
information in some cities' newspapers. If you are a AFM union member, they
will probably be able to assist as well - that's their job, after all! The
AFM has a BBS at 1-800-408-1330 [+1 212-768-2525]; speeds up to 28.8kbps,
enter "new" for userID. Currently this BBS is only available to AFM members.
Be forewarned; this is a Pentium/90 system ;-)

19. Single vs. Double (vs. Triple) horns

Most of the following four sections were inspired by a question from Karen
Comer.

Most modern horns are known as "double" horns - not because there are two of
them, but because they are equipped with a "trigger" valve (usually at the
thumb) which changes the pitch of the instrument from F to Bb. In actuality,
most horn players merely learn alternate fingerings for the "Bb side" and
continue to read parts in F, without realizing that what they are actually
doing is a rather difficult transposition!

The Bb instrument allows more security in the upper register, and most
teachers of the horn recommend playing on the Bb side on all notes above 2nd
line G. The trigger also allows the seven lowest notes, C to F below the
bass clef staff (new notation), to be played, if the hornist has developed
that register. [Note - these are pitches "as written" in F, not concert
pitches].

The standard double horn is a "full" double, meaning that there are two
complete paths for air to flow, including separate tubing for the three
normal valves. Older "compensating" doubles share paths through the three
valves and are much more difficult to tune and generally play. A couple of
horn manufacturers even make "triple" horns, with two thumb valves to chose
between the keys of F and Bb, found in a double, and F alto, found in
descant horns (c.f.). Such horns are quite heavy and are rarely used today.

                               ---------------

                               ---------------

20. Descant horns

A descant horn is a smaller horn (a smaller diameter, and shorter length),
usually pitched in F alto, that has a brighter sound and which facilitate
playing in the upper register, much as a piccolo trumpet compared to normal
trumpets. These are not commonly used, but do see occasional use in woodwind
ensembles and wherever sustained very high playing is called for. Triple
horns incorporate a F alto side, and many descant horns include a "stopping
valve" to ease playing of gestopft notes. Most descants are double horns,
with Bb being the second pitch..

Christopher Stratton (stratton@mit.edu) adds:

"'Descant horn' generally refers to any horn shorter than 8.5 foot Bb,
typically the 6 or so foot 'high F' horn.  Much as the Bb side of a
double adds security in the high range, going another step to a high F
horn makes very high parts just a bit less treacherous.  It seems
these instruments are often used for the extremely high parts
sometimes found in baroque or goofy modern literature.

Actually, that 'any horn shorter than Bb' statement is a bit
misleading, because many modern descant horns are Bb/high F doubles.
Some 1st horn players (those who would never use the F side of a
traditional double anyway) prefer Bb/high F descants for all-around
use.  I believe Michael Thompson plays one as well.  Some people with
durable biceps opt for the 'swiss army knife' of horns, the F/Bb/high
F triple, since it lets them feel prepared to face just about anything
someone may toss in front of them."

21. Natural horns

This section inspired by email from Bob Goodman.

"Natural" horns are horns with no valves. The notes the horn can play are
restricted by the harmonics corresponding to the key the instrument is in,
modified by "stopping" the horn as well as those produced by the "hand mute"
technique; said techniques allow the production of notes that are on half
step higher and lower, respectively. Until the 1800s, almost all horns were
of the valveless variety. The horn player of that era had to be a master of
stopping and hand muting, and could produce notes outside the normal
harmonic range by changing the key of the instrument. This was done by
changing "crooks" - basically, a slide attachment that added or subtracted
length from the instrument. This is one reason for the multitude of keys
that modern horn players have to contend with - composers would mark
sections for "horn in D" when those notes were called for, "horn in G" when
a moderation from D to G might occur, etc.

Natural horns still see some use today, mostly in academic surroundings and
at conferences. "Villanelle", by Paul Dukas, is probably the most well-known
modern work composed for natural horn.

A seminal work for the study and performance of the natural horn is:

22. Geyer vs Kruspe wrap

There is no "standard" horn design, but two major designers who have
influenced modern horn design are Geyer and Kruspe. The Geyer design puts
the fourth ("trigger") valve away from the player on the far side of the
valve stack. The Kruspe design, which is favored by more manufacturers,
places the trigger closest to the player, and may have more tuning options
than a Geyer wrap. Other than the tuning differences, each type of wrap has
its proponents, advantages, and disadvantages, which often relate more to
the individuals' playing style as much as anything else.

23. How old is my horn?

Often, the only way to tell the age of a horn is by checking it's serial
number against a manufacturer's list. These are a bit long to put in the
faq, but I will put links to html pages with the info here.

24. Are there any "WWW" sites for the horn?

Robin Moffatt has created an web archive of topical, timely discussions from
the horn mailing list. In an ideal world, they'd be in this FAQ, ;-) but
Robin is doing a fine job of preserving the flow of the original
conversations, rather than turning things into a dry compendium of topics
such as you see here. Have a look, and for God's sake, read what is said
about the Vienna Philharmonic before rehashing it on the list for the 50th
time!

The Norwegian Music Information Centre contains catalogues of Norwegian
contemporary sheet music, including horn solo and ensemble music.

Robert Ward, of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, is working on his home
page, including a work-in-progress, "The Horn Warm Up Book".

Sharon Zurflieh has set up a site with MIDI-based accompaniments of horn
solos. These are great to practise to when you don't have an accompianist
handy, plus with most MIDI software, you can vary the tempo, etc. to your
own tastes..

Harlan Feinstein's home page includes such fun things as information about
jazz horn players.

The Music Publishers' Association of the United States web site may be of
interest to horn players. It includes a listing of officers, MPA Sales
Agency List, a copyright reshourse center, and more.

[Image] Speaking of jazz horn players, see John Clark's Hidden Meaning Music
site for an example of someone who is very successful as a hornist in this
field.

Dennis Brain lovers probably want to check out Ivan Wong's Dennis Brain
Homepage and the Dennis Brain Discography.

Mary Keezer sent out a survey to the amateur hornists on the list and has
compiled some of the replies to the questions. The responses give quite a
bit of insight into why amateurs continue to play; see Stories from an
Amateur Hornist Survey for more.

Prof. Thomas Bacon's Thomas Bacon Horn Page is extremely well-done and
offers a wealth of information to both the amateur and professional hornist.
THE web site for the Horn, it includes Prof. Bacon's study guide, audio
clips, and more.

Well-known European hornist Hanz Pizka offers a someone different take on
things from his home page. You'll find information from his publishing firm,
pictures of Wiener horns (the unique piston F horns that they use over
there), advice to young players, and more. Note that Herr Piska "states it
as he sees it" :-)

Eric Pingel's class project on the horn is an interesting and well-designed
introduction to the instrument, although you'll need a frame-capable browser
to view it. Eric's site combines other net resources with original content
of his own to present a visually pleasing reference to the instrument.
There's even a final exam so that you can see what you learned.

[Image] Christopher Cornette's Horn Pages are a new and welcome addition to
the family of horn pages. An incredibly comprehensive collection of horn
links is just the starting point on this site, which includes a weekly MIDI
clip (and substantial ones at that), links to the Northwest Horn Society,
CMU Horn Club Online, the 560th ANG Band, a bio, and more. He even rates the
sites (giving this FAQ a generous **** rating; I'm not so sure). Well worth
an afternoon or evening's visit, but be prepared to spend some time here.

The British Horn Society Home Page is of interest to more than UK hornists.
Included here is Horn News, information on BHS publications, and more.

The Swedish Horn Society Home Page looks to be of interest to those versed
in Swedish. There appear to be links, stories on the horn, performance tips,
book reviews, and more. I wish I could read the pages!

The Historic Brass Society World Wide Web Site is a must for anyone
interested in the history of their instrument.

I've given up on Windplayer magazine ever adding horn to their site. Over a
year now, same five "popular" instruments they've always had. OK, guys, try
playing "Star Wars" with just flute, clarinet, sax, trumpet, and trombone.

The FAQ author's home page will have links to WWW horn sites as time permits
and as info comes in. Point to http://www.io.com/~rboerger for more. [there
is a pointer to this FAQ off this page]

Again, if you know of any horn sites that you'd like to have listed here,
send me a note.

Although I can't remember whose idea this thread was, A. M. Lorraine Fader

29. Where can I get more information about the internet/usenet?

For more info about usenet news, you might want to subscribe to the news
group news.announce.newusers and news.newusers.questions. These are groups
devoted to people who are new to using usenet news.

Be aware that in some newsgroups, people are not very tolerant of "new user"
mistakes or questions. It's usually a good idea to ride along and just read
postings for a while, to get a feel for how the particular newsgroup works.
After you're familiar with what goes on, feel free to post. Also, if you use
America Online, the greater usenet community will be less likely to tolerate
mistakes you make just because of your address. Sad, but true.. There are
many good books on the Internet. Some recommendations:

        The USENET Handbook:  A Users Guide to NetNews, by Mark Harrison
                O'Reilly & Assoc; ISBN 1-56592-101-1; US$24.95

        The Whole Internet User's Guide & Catalog, by Ed Krol
                O'Reilly & Assoc; ISBN 1-56592-063-5; US$24.95

        Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh, by Adam C. Engst
                Hayden Books; ISBN 1-56830-064-6; US$29.95, CDN$37.95
        - Includes software to actually connect a Mac to the internet
          as well as info on a Seattle-based service provider
        - I think there's a Windoze version of the book out now.

        Connecting to the Internet, by Susan Estrada
                O'Reilly & Assoc; ISBN 1-56592-061-9; US$15.95

Yes, the FAQ maintainer is partial to O'Reilly books, but has no financial
interest in the company ;-)

30. Who the heck is Ron Boerger?

I am an amateur hornist active in community groups in the Austin, Texas, USA
area. I am good enough to get the very occasional paying gig but that's
about it. As to why I am the maintainer of the FAQ, well, nobody else seemed
to be doing it .. in real life, I am a senior systems administrator for
Tandem Computers, and am doing contract sysadmin work for VTEL Corporation.
I am also president of the Austin Symphonic Band. Guess how much free time I
have? ;-)

I now maintain the COMMUNITY-MUSIC mailing list, as well. This list is
devoted to community bands and orchestras. For more info, email me.
