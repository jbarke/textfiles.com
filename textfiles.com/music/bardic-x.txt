             ABDUL EL BULBUL, EMIR!
                         -Anonymous

     In the harems of Egypt it's good to behold
     The fairest of harlots appear,
     But the fairest, a Greek
     Was owned by a sheik
     Named Abdul el Bulbul Emir!

     A traveling brothel came into the town
     Run by a pimp from afar
     Whose great reputation 
     Had traveled the nation:
     'Twas Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     Abdul the Bulbul arrived with his bride
     A prize whose eyes shone like a star
     He claimed he could prong
     More cunts with his dong
     Than Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     A day was arranged for the spectacle great;
     A visit was planned by the Czar!
     And the curbs were all lined
     With harlots reclined
     In honour of Ivan Skavar!

     They met on the track with their tools hanging slack
     Dressed only in shoes and a leer,
     Both were fast on the rise
     but folks gasped at the size
     Of Abdul el Bulbul Emir!

     The cunts were all shorn, and no rubbers adorned
     The prongs of the pimp and the peer,
     But the pimp's steady stroke
     Soon left without hope
     The chance of the Bulbul Emir!

     They worked thru the night til the dawn's early light
     The clamor was heard from afar
     The multitudes came 
     To applaud the ball game
     Of Abdul and Ivan Skavar!

     When Ivan had finished, he turned to the Greek,
     And laughed when she shivered in fear
     She swallowed his pride, 
     He buggered the bride
     Of Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!


                      (more)

Abdul El Bulbul Emir (cont.)

     When Ivan was done, and was wiping his gun,
     He bent down to polish his gear;
     He felt, up his ass,
     A hard pecker pass;
     'Twas Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!           

     The crowd loudly howled that it was a foul,
     They were ordered to part, by the Czar,
     But fast they were jammed;
     The pecker was crammed
     In Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     Now, the cream of the joke, when apart they were broke,
     Was laughed at for years by the Czar:
     For Abdul the Bulbul
     Left most of his tool
     In Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     The fair Grecian maiden a sad vigil keeps
     With a husband whose tastes have turned queer...
     She longs for the dong
     That once did belong
     To Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!

                  AGAINST ALL FLAGS
                  (Tune: "Girl I Left Behind Me")

  Oh, the SCA is the kind of play
  That spodes all get their kicks on
  And Pennsic War is the kind of bore
  That the peoples can get sicks on!
  And I'd like to sod the Goddam BoD
  With a dildo made of brass on,
  And your Kingdom Flag is the kind of rag
  That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

  Oh the Chivalry are very "twee,"
  And the Laurels don't do nothin'.
  And the Pelican fags are all on the rag;
  In an uproar about somethin'.
  For the King and Queen are seldom seen,
  With their Goddam cute brass hats on,
  And your Kingdom Flag is the kind of a rag
  That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

  Oh the Great Dark Horde doesn't have a sword
  That's worth a wooden firkin
  And the Moritu don't know what to do
  But sit and jerk their gherkin!
  And the Tuchux upchuck woodchuck guts
  At the Royal's brass-ass hats on,
  And the Mongol flag is the kind of a rag
  That the Kingdom wipes it's ass on!

          ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE!
                (from "The Life Of Brian" (Monty Python)

    Cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
    Some things in life are bad
    They can really make you mad
    Other things just make you swear and curse
    When you're chewing on life's gristle
    Don't grumble, give a whistle
    And this'll help things turn out for the best...
    And......always look on the bright side of life
     (whistle)
    Always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)

    If life seems jolly rotten
    There's something you've forgotten
    And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
    When you're feeling in the dumps,
    Don't be silly chumps
    Just purse your lips and whistle--that's the thing.

    And...always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)
    Always look on the right side of life...
     (whistle)

    For life is quite absurd
    And death's the final word
    You must always face the curtain with a bow
    Forget about your sin--give the audiences a grin
    Enjoy it--it's your last chance anyhow.
    So always look on the bright side of death
    Just before you draw your terminal breath

    Life's a piece of shit
    When you look at it
    Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
    You'll see it's all a show,
    Keep 'em laughing as you go
    Just remember that the last laugh is on you.

    And always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)
    Always look on the right side of life
     (whistle)

        THE ANCIENT AND OLD IRISH CONDOM
                              -Anonymous
        (Tune: "Rosin the Beau")
        (Recorded: "Celtic Pride: In Strange Form")

     I was up to me arse in the muck, Sir,
     with a peat contract down in the bog
     When me shovel it struck something hard, Sir,
     that I thought was a rock or a log

     T'was a box of the finest old oak, Sir,
     T'was a foot long, and four inches wide
     and not giving a damn for the Fairies
     I just took a quick look inside

     Now I opened the lid of this box, Sir,
     and I swear that my story is true
     T'was an ancient and old Irish condom
     A relic of Brian Boru

     T'was an ancient and old Irish condom
     T'was a foot long, and made of elk hide,
     With a little gold tag on it's end, Sir,
     with his name, rank, and stud fee inscribed

     Now, I cast me mind back thru the ages
     To the days of that horny old Celt
     With his wife lyin' by on the bed, Sir,
     As he stood by the fire in his pelt

     And I thought that I heard Brian whisper
     As he stood in the fire's rosy light
     "Well, you've had yer own way long enough, dear...
     'Tis the hairy side outside, tonight."

      THE BALLAD OF STARK UNBELIEF
                 -Ioseph of Locksley
                 -tune: variant on "I wish I was a busy bee"
                        or "There are no Fighter Pilots"

     (Chorus): Oh------
               Put it on the ground
               Spread it all around
               Dig it with a hoe
               It'll make your flowers grow!

     Now, peerages are given for a reason
     And that reason is simply understood:
     For Chivalry, and Honesty, and Bravery
     And being very, very, very Good!

     Awards are given out to the deserving,
     And no one EVER bitches, out of spite!
     We forget the little slights and innuendos
     And we really DO believe that Right makes Might!

     "Nepotisim" is a word we've never heard of,
     "Politics" is just a friendly little game!
     We have counted every shot that we've been given,
     And Camelot is where we always aim!

     Oh the King is up there, sitting in the Throne Room,
     And the Pelicans are sitting on the grass,
     The Knights are getting drunk and falling down (a lot),
     And the Laurels are all sitting on their...laurels! 

     The BoD is doing something I'm not sure of,        
     The Registry has lost your membership,
     The Marshallate can't find it's head with both hands and a road-map,
     And the Heralds are all full of chicken-ship!

      THE BALL OF BALLYKNURE (AKA: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS)
               -Traditional Scots from the 1880's
               SCA verses by Ioseph of Locksley & many others
               NO responsibility for misuse is assumed!

 Oh the Ball, the Ball of Ballyknure
 Where your wife, and my wife, were doin' it on the floor!

 (chorus) Wha' do ya, lassie?
          and wha' do y'noo?
          I'm the man what did y'last, lass,
          I canna do y'noo!

 The Queen was in the parlour, eatin bread and honey
 The King was in the chambermaid, and she was in the money!

 The village idiot he was there, a-sittin' by the fire
 Attempting masturbation with an india-rubber tyre!

 Oh, the village postman he was there, but he had the Pox
 He couldna' do the ladies so he did the letter-box!

 The Queen of England she was there, backed against the wall
 "Put yer money on the table, boys, I'm going ta do you all!"

 The Count and Countess, they were there, a-doin' on the stair
 The bannister broke, and down they fell, they finished in mid-air!

 There was music in the garden, there was music in the sticks
 You couldna' hear the music for the swishin' o' the pricks!

 They were doin' it on the landing, they were doin' it on the stairs
 You couldna' see the carpet for the wealth of pubic hairs!

 The Kingdom Herald, he was there, whattya think o'that?
 Blazoning positions wi' a Duchess and a cat!

 The fubba-wubbas they were there, sittin' all alone
 Complainin of the doin's with loud and piercing moans!

 Mr. Jameison he was there, the one that fought the Boers
 He jumped up on the table and he shouted for the hoors!

 The Board of Directors they were there, and they were shocked to see
 Four-and-twenty maidenheads a-hangin' from a tree!

 John the Blacksmith he was there, he wouldna play the game
 He did a lassie seven times, but wouldna see her hame!

 The village Constable he was there, now whattya think o'that?
 Amusin' himself by abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat...

 It started out so simple-like: each lad and lassie mated
 But pretty soon the doin's got so bloody complicated!

 Four and twenty virgins came down from Cuinimore
 Only two got back again, and they were double-bore!

 Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

 Clan MacChluarain, they were there, sleepin in the shade
 For no one could decide if they were Man, or Sheep, or Maid!

 The village pervert he was there, scratchin' at his crotch
 But no one minded him at all, he was only there to watch!

 The Kingdom Seneshal was there, linin' 'em up in rows
 He didna use his pecker, lads, he did 'em with his toes!

 The village cripple he was there, but he didna shag too much
 His old John Thomas had fallen off, so he did 'em with his crutch!

 The old schoolteacher he was there, he diddled by rule-of-thumb
 workin' logarithmicly the times that he would come!

 The village chimney-sweep was there, a really filthy brute
 For every time he farted, he covered 'em all with soot!

 The local Cavaliers were there, in elegance they sat
 A-doin' Things Unusual with the feathers in their hat!

 The Rapier-fighters they were there, doin' what they could
 A-thrustin' and a-parryin' with Real Steel, not with wood!

 The local Hordesmen they were there, busier than bees
 the ladies wouldna have 'em, so they diddled dogs and trees!

 The village carpenter he was there, with his prick of wood
 He made it when he lost his own, and it worked just as good!

 The shenai-fighters they were there, all wrapped up in smiles
 A-doin' everyone they could in Oriental style!

 The College of Heralds they were there, in the other room
 Arguin' about who would do what, with which, to whom!

 The rattan-jocks were out in force and they were such a sight
 They didna do the ladies 'cause they'd heard there was a fight!

 The old fishmonger he was there, a dirty stinkin sod
 He never got a rise that night, so he diddled 'em with a cod!

 The Kingdom Laurels they were there, and quite a sight to see
 A-doin' everyone they could, and most artisticly!

 The Kingdom Pelicans were there, doin' it with a sob
 They diddled out of duty; it was just another job!

 Four and twenty virgins went down to Inverness
 And when the Ball was over, there were four and twenty less!

 There was doin's on the porches, and doin's on the stones
 You couldna' hear the music for the loud and joyful moans!

 (insert name) he was there, covered up with smiles
 Doin' thirty-two at once, and in amazing style!

 Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

 All the Kingdom spodes were there, but they just sat and sulked
 For this was the occasion that no one told them "Get fulked!"

 Clan MacChluarain they were there, chasin' round the Keep
 And every single man of them buggerin' a sheep!

 (insert name) had a gerbil, he diddled it very well
 He didn't wrap it in duct tape: he blew it all to hell!

 (insert name) he was there, with his favourite toys:
 A dozen beautiful women, and a dozen beautiful boys!

 (insert name) he was there; he wasn't very nice
 He didna do the ladies, he did gerbils, rats and mice!

 (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
 Takin' on all comers, and she hasn't finished yet!

 (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
 The Dark Horde carried her away, and we ain't found her yet!

 The Locksley Monsters they were there, lookin' for some nookie
 But they got distracted by a chocolate chippie cookie!

 (insert name) he was there, a crafty friend of Ghengis,
 He speaks a lot of languages; he is a cunning linguist!

 The village Masochist, he was there, beggin' for some blows
 The Sadist merely looked at him, and softly answered "No!"

 Yang the Nauseating was sittin' out in back
 The ladies did na' want him for he smelled too much of yak!

 The village druggist he was there, grinnin' like a fox
 He'd sold out of condoms, so he sold 'em dirty socks!

 Buell the Kind was also there, that beggar meek and mild,
 He didna' do the ladies, he had brought his favourite child!

 (insert name) he was there at the revel feast
 He doesn't like the girls, and the boys call him "The Beast!"

 And in the morning, early, the Farmer nearly shat
 For four and twenty acres was nearly fuckit flat!

 It was a grand old party, lads, and sure a Locksley Plot
 And every lad and lassie there was glad of what they got!

 And when the Ball was over, everyone confessed
 The music it was wonderful, but the "doin's" were the best!

 With "Dowland" from her lute, and "Palestrina" from her crotch!

 There was doin's in the bedrooms, there was doin's in the tub
 'Till every single pecker there was worn down to a nub!

 The bride was in the bedroom, explainin' to the groom:
 The vagina, not the rectum, is the entrance to the womb! 

 The King was in the counting house, counting out his wealth;
 The Queen was in the parlor, playin' with herself!

 Santa Claus, he dropped right in, bouncin' thru the flue;
 Grabbin' all the lassies and doin' 'em two-by-two!

 The Easter Bunny, he was there, searchin' for some eggs
 He found one in a mess of hair between a lady's legs!

 The leprechaun he sauntered in, all of three feet high
 Just the size to stick his nose into some furry pie!

 (insert name) he was there, playin' on his lute
 Teachin' all the lassies how to play in his skin-flute!

 The village vet, he was there, lookin' to get laid
 Askin' round the ladies if they had been spayed!
 
 (insert name) he was there, rubbing ladie's backs
 But no matter how long or hard he tried they wouldn't jump in his sack

 Rialtans they were also there, with their keyboards and their screens
 Until somebody threw a willing wench into their damned machines

 Ioseph of Locksley he was there, furthering the Plot
 Thank God for penicillin, we don't know quite what he got

 (insert name) was also there, with his cooler full o' beer
 Just his luck, he tried to fuck a lass who turned out queer

 The King and his knights were there, with brass hat and white belts
 Doin' tricks with a wench or six in a pile of ferret pelts

 (insert name) he was also there, with his wolves upon a chain
 Panting and howling like he'd been caught in in a patch of wolfie-bane

 The local Herald, he was there, with his books so tall and thick
 Walking about in pompous haste, and stepping on his dick!

 Pet. de Cat., de cavalier, showed up in lace and leather
 The morning after, he woke on a rafter, his clothes were in the heather

 A tribe of Tuchux they were there, just dressed in bunny fur
 They all ran out when they heard a shout "You @#$%-&*# Cur!"

 Ardjjuk Afraid-of-his-Cats was there and he was fraught with fear
 At the very thought of getting caught by one of the pussies near

 Four and twenty virgins came out from the West
 It didna' take 'em long 'til they was doin' with the best!

 Clan Blue Feather, they were there, a bunch of folks so gay
 I didn't mind so long as they did not get in the way

 Good Sir <insert name> was there, white belt across his mid
 When the ladies saw him coming, they all ran off and hid

 Good Sir <insert name> was there, with spurs upon his heels
 Showing the gals how to please their pals and suffocate trouser eels

 Entertainin' all the lads, and doin' 'em three by three!

              THE BANTAM COCK
              (Recorded: "Celtic Pride: In Strange Form")
                            
      He was a fine upstanding bantam-cock
      So brisk, and stiff, and spry...
      With a springy step, and a jaunty plume,
      And a purposeful look in his eye
      In his little black laughing eye!

      So I took him to the coop and introduced him to
      My seventeen wide-eyed hens
      And he tupped and he tupped as a hero tupps,
      And he bowed to them all, and then,
      He up and took 'em all again!

      Then upon the peace of my ducks and geese
      He boldly did intrude
      And with glazed eyes and opened mouths
      They bore him with fortitude...
      And a little bit of gratitude!

      He jumped my giggling guinea-fowl!
      He thrust his attentions upon
      Twenty hysterical turkeys,
      And a visiting migrant swan!
      And the bantam thundered on!

      He groped my fan-tail pigeon doves,
      My lily-white Columbine,
      And as I was lookin' at me budgerigar,
      He jumped my parrot from behind!
      And it was sittin' on me shoulder at the time!

      But all of a sudden, with a gasp and a gulp,
      He clapped his wings to his head!
      He lay flat on his back with his feet in the air;
      My bantam-cock was dead!
      And the vultures circled overhead!

      What a noble beast! What a champion cock!
      What a way to live and die!
      As I dug him a grave to protect his bones,
      From those hungry buzzards in the sky,
      The bantam opened up his eyes!

      He gave me a wink, and a terrible grin,
      The way that rapists do....
      He said, "Do you see them silly daft buggers up there?
      They'll be down in a minnit 'er two!
      They'll be down in a minnit 'er two!"

             THE BASTARD KING OF ENGLAND
             -attributed to Rudyard Kipling, but probably not!

 Oh the mistrels sing of an English King of many long years ago
 who ruled his Land with an iron hand tho his morals were weak and low
 his only outer garment was a dirty yellow shirt
 with which he served to hide his hide, but he couldn't hide the dirt

 He was dirty, and lousy, and full of fleas
 but a Royal Tool hung to his knees
 God bless the Bastard King of England!

 Now the Queen of Spain was an amorous Jane, a lascivious wench was she
 who heard about the prowess of this King from over the sea
 so she sent a Royal Message by a Royal Messenger
 to ask the King of England to spend the night with her

 He was dirty and lousy and full of fleas
 but he kept his women by twos and threes....
 God Bless the Bastard King of England!

 When Philip of France heard of this chance, he swore before his Court
 "The Queen prefers my rival just because mine's...somewhat short."
 So he sent the Count of Zippety-Zap
 to give to the Queen a Dose of Clap
 to pass it on to the Bastard King of England!
 
 When the King of England heard the news, he cursed the Gallic farce
 and he up and swore by the Royal Whore he'd have the Frenchman's arse
 So he offered half his Kingdom, and a piece of Queen Hortense
 To any Royal Subject who'd undo the King of France
 
 So the brave young Duke of Buckingham went instantly to France
 He swore he was a fruitier; the King took down his pants.
 So in front of the throng he slipped on a thong
 and jumped on his horse and he galloped along
 dragging the Frenchman back to Merrie England!

 When the King of England saw the sight he fainted dead on the floor,
 for during the ride his rival's hide had stretched...a yard...or more!
 and all the girls of England came down to London Town
 and shouted round the battlements "To hell with the British Crown!"
 
 So Philip of France usurped the Throne 
 his scepter was his Royal Bone
 with which he bitched the Bastard King of England!

 And when his men pulled out again      So they threw him in a stinking jail

 There are Jews in the world, There are Buddhists. 
 There are Hindus and Mormons and then...
 There are those that follow Mohammed 
 But I've never been one of them...

 I'm a Roman Catholic, 
 And have been since before I was born.
 And the one thing they say about Catholics is, 
 They'll take you as soon as you're warm.

 You don't have to be a six-footer, 
 You don't have to have a great brain,
 You don't have to have any clothes on, 
 You're a Catholic the moment Dad came.

 Because...

 Every sperm is sacred, Every sperm is great,
 If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate.

 Let the heathens spill theirs On the dusty ground,
 God shall make them pay for Each sperm that can't be found.

 Every sperm is wanted, Every sperm is good,
 Every sperm is needed, In your neighboorhood.

 Every sperm is useful, Every sperm is fine,
 God needs everybody's, Mine and mine and mine.

 Let the pagans spill theirs, On mountain here and then,
 God will strike them down for each sperm that's spilt in vain.

 Every sperm is sacred, Every sperm is good,
 Every sperm is needed In your neighborhood.

         THE FARTING CONTEST
         (Tune: Sweet Betsy From Pike)

 I'll tell you a story that is sure to please
 Of a great farting contest at Sutton-on-Pease
 Where all the best arses paraded the field
 To compete in a contest for various shields.
           Some tighten their arses and fart up the scale
           To compete for a cup, or a barrel of ale,
           While others, whose arses are biggest and strongest,
           Compete in the section for loudest and longest.

 Now, this year's event had drawn quite a big crowd
 And the betting was even on Mrs. McDowd
 For it had appeared, in the evening edition,
 That this lady's arse was in perfect condition.
           Miss Bingle arrived amid roars of applause
           And promptly proceeded to pull off her drawers
           For, though she'd no chance in the farting display
           She'd the prettiest bottom you'd see in a day!

 Now, young Mrs. Porter was backed for a place
 though she'd often been placed in the deepest disgrace
 by dropping a fart on a Sunday in church
 And disturbing the sermon of Reverend McGurk!
           The ladies lined up, at the signal to start,
           And, winning the toss, Mrs. Jones to first fart;
           The people around stood in silence and wonder,
           While her wireless transmitted gale force and thunder!

 Now, Mrs. McDowd reckoned nothing of this
 For she'd had some weak tea, and was all wind and piss;
 So she took up her place, and her arse opened wide,
 But, unluckily, shit, and was disqualified!
           Then young Mrs. Porter was called to the front
           And started by doing a wonderful stunt:
           She took a deep breath, and, clenching her hands,
           She blew the damnned roof off the popular stands!

 This left young Miss Bingle, who shyly appeared,
 And smiled at the clergy, who lustily cheered!
 And though it was thought that her chances were small,
 She ran out a winner, out-farting them all!
           She went to the rostrum with dignified gait,
           And took from the Vicar a set of gold plate,
           Then she turned to the clergy, with sweetness sublime,
           And, smiling, said "Come up and see me sometime!"

 The clergy was shocked by Miss Bingle's remark,
 Though some felt a stirring 'neath vestment and sark,
 Perhaps t'was the wind - but who could have guessed?
 And that was the end of the farting contest!

          FOUR DRUNKEN MAIDENS

 There were three drunken maidens come from the Isle of Wight.
 They drunk from Monday morning, nonstop 'til Saturday night.
 When Saturday night came 'round me boys, they would not then go out.
 These three drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 Then up come handsome Sally, her cheeks as red as bloom.
 Move up me jolly sisters and give young Sally room
 For I'll be your equal before we then go out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 There's woodcock and pheasant, there's partridge and hare,
 There's all sorts of dainties, no scarcity was there.
 There's forty quarts of beer, me boys, they fairly drunk them out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 Then up come the landlord, he's asking for his pay.
 It's a forty pound bill, me boys, these girls have got to pay.
 That's ten pounds apiece, me boys, but still they wouldn't go out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 Oh, where are your feathered hats, your mantles rich and fine?
 They've all been swallowed up in tankards of good wine.
 And where are your maidenheads, you maidens brisk and gay?
 We left them in the alehouse, we drunk them clear away!

                 THE FRIGGIN' FALCON
                      -Theodore R. Cogswell
                (Tune: "Ghost Riders In the Sky")

 I was walkin' out one evening by the friggin' reservoir
 A-wishing that I had a quid to pay my friggin' score
 My head it was a-achin' and my throat was parched and dry
 So I up and sent a little prayer wingin' to the sky

 Then there came a friggin' falcon and He walked upon the waves
 And I said "A friggin' miracle!" and sang a couple staves
 Of a friggin' churchly ballad I learned at me mother's knee
 But when the friggin' bird took off he went and spattered me!

 I dropped upon my friggin' knees and bowed my friggin' head
 And said three friggin' Aves for all the friggin' dead
 And then I rose up to my feet and said another ten
 The friggin' bird burst into flame and spattered me again!

 The falcon blazed up in the sky just like a friggin' sun
 And seared my friggin' eyelids shut and when the job was done
 He whooshed across the friggin' sky just like a shooting star
 I went to see the friggin' priest; he bummed my last cigar!

 I told him of the burning bird, he told me of the Rose
 I showed him guano in my hair, the bastard held his nose!
 So I went to see the Bishop, but the friggin' Bishop said
 "Go home and sleep it off, you sod, and wash your friggin' head!"

 Then I came upon a friggin' wake for a lousy friggin' swine
 By the name of Jock O'Leary and I touched his head with mine
 He sat up in his friggin' box, and he shook his friggin' head
 His wife pulled out a .44, and filled him full of lead!

 Then I lost my friggin' temper and let out a friggin' yell
 "Blow one more hole in poor old Jock and I'll see you burn in Hell!"
 And once again I raised him up and brought him back to life
 Jock whimpered as his head came off...this time she used a knife!

 And then she flopped upon her knees and started in to pray
 "Please, Lord," she said, "It's thirty years I've waited for this day!"
 Still I went about the friggin' town to heal the friggin' lame
 But every time I raised them up, they got knocked down again!

 How the good Lord sends His blessings down in a friggin' curious way
 But when He's marked a man for Love, that Love is there to stay
 But the way you've got to use that Love is a friggin' queer affair
 There ain't no point to raisin' stiffs, and there ain't no point to prayer

 And this I know because I've got an ever-flowing sign
 For every time I wash my head, the water turns to wine!
 And I give it free to working blokes to brighten their poor lives
 So they don't kick no dogs around, or beat up on their wives

 For there ain't no point to miracles like walking on the sea
 They crucified the Son of God, but they don't muck with me!
 For I leave the friggin' blind alone and the dying and the dead
 But every day at four o'clock...I wash my friggin' head!

 All things dull and ugly, All creatures great and squat
 All things rude and nasty, The Lord God made the lot.

 Each little snake that poisons, Each little wasp that stings
 He made their brutish venom, He made their horrid wings.

 All things sick and cancerous, All evil great and small
 All things foul and dangerous, The Lord God made them all.

 Each nasty little hornet, Each beastly little squid
 Who made the spikey urchin, Who made the sharks? He did.

 All things scabbed and ulcerous, All pox both great and small
 Putrid, foul and gangrenous, The Lord God made them all.

 Our fathers built a Kingdom, from nothing in the desert
 I watched them work with heart and soul to build
 Something worthwhile, for the keeping, but now my heart is weeping
 And I can't stay and see their dreaming killed!

 Chivalry and honour, courtesie and kindness
 Are words that are forgotten and ignored
 For we must fight to win, and counting blows' a sin
 So I think I'll go and join the bloody Horde!

 The Belted Boys are arrogant; they think they run the Kingdom
 They've made the Dream into a bloody whore!
 For chivalry's forgotten, and the membership is droppin'
 And I'll not put up with it any more!

                 THE GOOD SHIP VENUS
                          -Anonymous

It was on the good ship Venus        The Captain's name was Morgan
My God, you should have seen us!     By God, he was a gorgon!
The figurehead was a whore in bed,   Ten times each day sweet tunes he'd play
And the mast, an upright penis!      On his reproductive organ!

The Captain of this lugger       The Captain's wife was Mable
He was a dirty bugger!           To screw, she wasn't able
He wasn't fit to shovel shit     So the dirty shits, they nailed her tits
From one place to another!       Across the Captain's table!

The Mate's name it was Andy
By God, he had a dandy!
Till they crushed his cock with a jagged rock
For coming in the brandy!
                                      
The second mate was Hooper             Another daughter, Charlotte
By God, he was a trooper!              Born and bred a harlot
He jerked and jerked until he worked   At night her thighs were lily white
Himself into a stupor!                 By morning they were scarlet!

The cabin boy, the cabin boy,          The Captain's dog was Rover
The dirty little nipper;               We rolled that poor dog over
He filled his ass with broken glass,   Ten times each day all along the way
And circumcised the Skipper!           From Calais back to Dover!

The Captain's daughter, Mable,     The Boatswains Mate named Carter
Was ready, willing and able,       Was quite an able farter
To fornicate with the second mate  Played anything from "God Save the Queen"
Upon the chartroom table!          To Beethoven's " 'Moon' Sonata"

The Captain's daughter, Mary,        The Captain had a First Mate
Had never lost her cherry,           He loved him like a brother
The men grew bold, and offered gold: And every night in the pale moonlight
Now there's no Virgin Mary!          They buggered one another!

The Captain's other daughter         The passengers were whiney
Fell in the deep sea water           They'd drunk up all their winey
Delighted squeals revealed that eels From bed to bed they looked for head
Had found her sexual quarter!        But settled for some hiney.

Aboard the good ship Venus         The Captain had a one-eyed cat
We sailors all were henious:       He kept it in the cabin
It was our fate to masturbate      He rubbed its ass with axle grease
And that develops meanness!        And started in a-jabbin'!

The trip it was exciting
The pleasures were inviting
All day we blew - all night we'd screw
By artificial lighting!

One day the good ship foundered          And when we reached our station
On crags our bags were pound(er)ed       We found to our elation
We stubbed our cocks against the rocks,  The ship had sunk in a sea of spunk
And then, we all were drownd(er)ed!      From mutual masturbation!

                 -Author unknown
     (Tune: "Dick Darby The Cobbler") 
 
  Oh, me name is Jimmy Swaggert, I'm a preacher, 
  I used to save souls on TV 
  But they caught me carousing with floozies 
  And they've taken my program from me! 

  (CHORUS): With me ing twing of an ing thing of an eye do 
            W'i me ing twing of an ing thing of an eye day, 
            W'i me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy, 
            And me bankroll gets bigger each day! 

  Well, when I was a lad, ma would scold me 
  Sayin' "James, keep your hands off your crotch!" 
  Well to do so was "dirty" she told me, 
  But she never said I couldn't watch! 

  Well, they labeled Jim Bakker a pervert, 
  And they called me a lecher, it's true; 
  Even though I never did nothin' 
  I just asked for a room with a view.... 

  Well, my sorrows they soon will be over, 
  And I'll soon be a rich man again, 
  For I've just sold my story to Playboy, 
  And the movie rights to MGM!

          THE KINGDOM THAT SWALLOWED A LIE
                     -Ardjukk Afraid-of-His-Cats

 There once was a Kingdom that swallowed a LIE
 I don't know why they swallowed a LIE......
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom that swallowed a RULE
 "The King's Word is Law" (We learn it in school!)
 They swallowed the RULE to hold up the LIE
 I don't know why they swallowed the LIE
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom that swallowed some BULL
 "The knights run the Kingdom, they have all the pull!"
 They swallowed the BULL to back up the RULE
 "The King's Word is Law!" (We learn it in school..)
 They swallowed the RULE to hold up the LIE
 And I don't know why they swallowed the LIE
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom got screwed by the CROWN
 Bent over, and down, they got screwed by the CROWN
 They got screwed by the CROWN 'cause they swallowed the BULL
 (etc as above)
 I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom that wrote to the BOARD
 They wrote to the BOARD in great disaccord
 They wrote to the BOARD they'd been screwed by the CROWN
 Bent over and down, they were screwed by the CROWN
 (etc as above)
 And I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom that took up the SWORD
 'Cause they didn't get shit when they wrote to the BOARD
 They took up the SWORD when they wrote to the BOARD
 They wrote to the BOARD in great disaccord
 (etc as above)
 I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
 Perhaps they'll die!

 There once was a Kingdom that threw up the LIE
 Right in their eye, they threw up the LIE
 They threw up the LIE and they changed all the RULES
 Opened Crown Tourney to all but the fools,
 They opened Crown Tourney to sweep up the BULL
 And let in the People, a real Miracle!
 They swept up the BULL and laughed at the BOARD
 And every man-jack of 'em joined the Dark Horde!
 And so they lived happy, and wealthy and wise
 And if this is treason, then it's all a LIE
 Can YOU see why?

                THE MERMAID
                    -Shel Silverstein

 When I was a lad in a fishing town, 
 an old man said to me
 You can spend your life, your jolly life, 
 a-sailing on the sea
 You can search the world for pretty girls 
 'til your eyes grow weak and dim
 But don't go swimmin' with a mermaid, son, 
 if you don't know how to swim!
         'Cause her hair is green as sea-weed
         Her lips are blue and pale
         I'll tell you now before you start
         You can love that girl with all your heart
         But you'll only love the upper part;
         You will -not- like the tail!

 I signed on to a whalin' ship, 
 and my very first day at sea
 I spied a mermaid in the waves, 
 a-reachin' out to me
 Come live with me in the sea, said she, 
 and down on the ocean's floor
 I'll show you a million wond'rous sights 
 you've never seen before!

 So I jumped on in and she pulled me down, 
 down to her sea-weed bed
 A pillow she made of tortoise shells, 
 and placed beneath my head
 She fed me shrimp and caviar 
 from a silvery dish
 She was just my taste (down to her waist) 
 but the rest of her was fish!
         Her hair was green as seaweed
         Her lips were blue and pale
         Her face it was a work of art
         But I only gave her half my heart
         'Cause tho I loved the upper part;
         I did -not- like the tail!

 And then one day when I looked up
 I saw a sailin' ship
 And I met the stare of a millionaire
 Out on a fishing trip
 A diamond ring he tied on a string 
 And lowered it down to her
 And my love divine, she went for the line
 And went for the usual lure!

                (more)

The Mermaid (cont.)

 So I sighed in the rolling tide, 
 and I cried to the clams and the whales
 How I missed her hair and her seagreen eyes; 
 I missed the shine of her scales
 Just then her sister swam on by, 
 and set my heart a-whirl....
 For her upper part was an ugly old fish.....
 but the -bottom- half was GIRL!
         Her toes are round and rosey!
         Her legs are slim and pale!
         Her face might not be a work of art
         But I love that girl with all my heart
         And I don't give a damn about the upper part
         That's how I end my tale! ('cause now I'm getting tail!)

 In Dublin's fair city, where the girls have no titties
 T'was there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
 You could have her for a penny, and be one of many,
 But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
         But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!

 She was a street walker, and sure t'was no wonder
 For so were her mother and grandmother too,
 With a mattress on the barrow, thru streets broad and narrow,
 And for sixpence they would act alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
         And for sixpence they would act alive, alive-o!

 She died of a fever, and no one could save her;
 It was caught from a folkie from Ontario,
 Now her ghost wheels the barrow thru streets broad and narrow
 But a ghost can't be had that's alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!

                         -David of Bagulay 

 A comely young wench from the south        
 Went travelling far and free   
 She said "I'm searching for love as true as the dove!"
 And she came to the north country

 CHORUS: Saying "I beg your pardon, Sir!
         I am but a modest wench....
         A lovely lively lusty busty rather outrageous wench  
         But a modest one, nevertheless!"

 She met with two grinning dwarves
 Said one to the other: "What bliss!
 You stand on her shoulder; together we'll hold her
 And give her a rousing kiss!"

 She met with a leering banker
 Who said "Banking has various facets...
 I could invest all your money till the ledgers looked funny,
 But I'd rather hold onto your assets!"

 She met with a hungry giant
 Who roared in stentorian tones
 "To pepper I'd falter; I'd rather assault her
 before I devour her bones!"

 She met with a country lout
 who said,"Massage me here on this hummock.
 Like my girlfriend who felt she should stop at the belt
 And never got up to my stomach..."

 She met with a charming minstrel
 "At last sir can you show me true love?"
 He chortled with glee as he patted her knee     
 He rubbed his hands as he fired up his glands     
 He looked very droll as he turned into a troll
 And sneered "Certainly! From below or above!"

           "I beg your pardon, sir!
           I -was- but a modest wench...
           A lovely lively lusty busty rather outrageous wench

                  THE MOOSE SONG
                       -Thomas Payton, et. al.
                  (tune: "Betsy From Pike")
 
 When I was a young girl (man) I used to like boys (girls),
 I fondled their tights (bodies) and played with their toys (curls),
 But me boy (girl) friend ran off with a salesman named Bruce,
 You'd never get treatment like that from a Moose!

 CHORUS: So it's Moose, Moose, I like a Moose,
         I've never had anything quite like a Moose,
         I've had many lovers, my life has been loose,
         But I've never had anything quite like a Moose!

 Now when I'm in need of a very good lay,
 I go to me stables and gets me some hay,
 I opens me window and spreads it around,
 'Cause Moose always comes when there's hay on the ground!

 Now I've made it with all kinds of beasties with hair,
 I'd make it with snakes if their fangs were not there,
 I've made it with walrus, two ducks and a goose,
 But I've never had anything quite like a Moose!
                                                      
 Now gorillas are fine for a Saturday night,
 And lions and tigers, they puts up a fight,
 But it just ain't the same when you slams your caboose
 As the feeling you gets when you humps with a Moose!

 I've tried many beasties on land or on sea
 I've even tried hump-backs that humped back on me!
 Sharks are quite good, tho they're hard to pull loose
 But on dry land there is nothing quite like a moose!

 Woodchucks are all right except that they bite
 And foxes and rabbits won't last thru the night!
 Cows would be fun, but they're hard to seduce
 But you never need worry should you find a moose!

 Step in my study, and trophies you'll find
 A black striped tiger and scruffy maned lion
 You'll know the elephant by his ivory tooth
 And the one that's a-winking, you know is the moose!

 The lion succumbed to a thirty-ought-six
 Machine guns and tigers I've proved do not mix
 The elephant fell by a bomb with a fuse
 But I won't tell a soul how I did in the moose!

 I've found many women attracted to me
 A few of them have had me over for tea
 Some say that they love me when they're feeling loose
 But I'd trade the world's women for one lovely moose!

 The good Lord made Adam, and then He made Eve
 Said He: "If you sin now, I'll ask you to leave!"
 They left not because of Eve's forbidden fruit
 But 'cause Adam decided the moose there were cute!

                    (more!)

The Moose Song (Cont.)

 The English are said to like boars who've had corn
 The Celtics just dream of the young Unicorn
 The Germans, it's said, just need leather and rope
 But give me a moose and I'll no longer mope!

 Now I've broken the laws in this god-awful state
 They've put me in prison and locked up the gate
 They say that tomorrow I'll swing from a noose
 But my last night I'll spend with a good sexy moose!

 Next morning the Governor's word reached my ears
 "We've commuted your sentence to ninety-nine years!"
 "You won't get parole; not a five minute's truce,
 And your friend goes to Sing-Sing, he's so big-a-moose!"

(slowly) Now that I'm old and advanced in me years,
    I'll look back on me life, and I'll shed me no tears,
    As I sit in me chair with me glass of Mateuse,
    And play hide the salami with Marvin (Millie) the Moose!

                   -Anonymous
           (Tune: "Old Used Queen")

 Once I was a swyver of the finest kind, a ruler of the bed
 But now I spend my days as an old used thing and I find I'm rubbed too red!
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never any fun for an old drubbed ding!

 My owner spends his time in solemn prayer, and dreams of naked flesh
 I spend MY time in clothbound walls getting slapped when we`re too fresh
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never some relief for an old drubbed ding!

 The other men they sit and talk of baring, thrust and fling
 But when I come out the wenches flee, and won't give me a thing
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never any girls for an old drubbed ding!

 The other ones can rise and dive and frolic near the ass
 I'm the Model of Priapus, I'm hard as hell, but must not make a pass!
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing
 never any fun for an old drubbed ding!

 But someday soon there'll be a change, in Martin Luther's "rise,"
 And the Reformation's opening "shot" will land between his eyes!
 With a Hey-ho derry up and down WE'LL sing,
 Then there will be FUN for an old drubbed ding!

                   -Traditional Irish

    As I was sittin by the fire 
    talking to O'Riley's daughter
    suddenly a thought came into my head: 
    I'd like to shag O'Riley's daughter

(Chorus):  Giddy aye ay, giddy aye ay, 
           giddy aye ay for the one-ball Riley
           Giddy aye ay:  (three claps or stomps) 
           try it on yer own big drum!

    Her hair was black and her eyes were blue
    The Colonel and the Major and the Captain sought her
    The Sergeant and the Private and the Drummer boy too
    All of 'em shagged O'Riley's daughter!

    Riley played on the big bass drum; 
    Riley had a mind for murder and slaughter
    Riley had a bright red glitterin eye 
    and he kept that eye on his lovely daughter

    While walking thru the park one day
    Who should I spy but Riley's daughter?
    Never a word I had to say
    But "Don't you think we really oughter?"

    Got me a bottle and a condom too, 
    got me hands on Riley's daughter
    settled me down for a good old time 
    doin' things we shouldn't oughter

    Up the stairs and into bed
    I shagged and shagged until I stove her
    Never a word that maiden said
    just laughed like hell till the fun was over!

    Suddenly a footstep on the stair 
    who should it be but Riley out for slaughter
    with two pistols in his hands 
    lookin for the man that shagged his daughter

    Grabbed Old Riley by the ball, 
    rammed his head in a pail of water
    shoved them pistols up his ass 
    a damn sight quicker than I shagged his daughter!

    As I go walkin' down the street
    People shout from every corner
    There's the randy sonofabitch
    That finally shagged Old Riley's daughter!

    Now all you lasses, all you maids
    Answer me now, and don't speak shyly
    Would you have it straight and true
    Or the way I gave it to One-Ball Riley?

         PUFF THE JEWISH DRAGON
                     -Anonymous
     (Tune: "Puff the Magic Dragon")

 Puff the Jewish dragon, lived in Palestine,
 And frolicked in the synagogue and drank Manischewitz wine.
 Little Rabbi Goldberg loved that dragon Puff,
 And fed him lox and matzoh balls and other kosher stuff.

 Then one day it happened, Puff was eating pork,
 Little Rabbi Goldberg took that dragon for a walk.
 Gently he explained that dragons don't eat meat
 That comes from little piggies that have dirty filthy feet.

 Then Puff became Bar Mitzvah, put on tefillin every day,
 Wrapped up in his tallis that's the way that he would pray;
 Made brachos before eating, benched after every meal -
 Imagine how religious it made that dragon feel.

 Now there were some people who did things just for spite.
 They'd curse Jews and attack them just to get into a fight.
 When Puff the dragon saw this, he roared a mighty roar -
 Now those wicked people are not with us anymore.

 Now Puff the Jewish dragon found himself a bride,
 Now little kosher dragons are his source of joy and pride.
 They'll grow up doing mitzvahs, learning Torah, praying too,
 With Rabbi Goldberg teaching them what kosher dragons do.

 You who may be listening may think we're making fun,
 But deep down in this story is a moral for everyone.
 If dragons can wear a kippah, keep Shabbos and Kosher too,
 Then you can learn, like Puff did, to be a real good Jew.

               PUFF, THE TRAGIC FAGGOT
                            -Anonymous
            (Tune: "Puff, The Magic Dragon")

 Puff, the tragic faggot, went on a spree
 And terrorized the people at the Nudist Colony!
 Little Jackie Paper, loved that rascal, Puff,
 But wished he wouldn't use so much of that "greasy kid stuff!"

CHORUS: Puff, the tragic faggot, went on a spree
        And terrorized the people at the Nudist Colony! (2X)

 Together they would travel, like a boat with billowed sail
 Jackie kept his fingers pressed 'neath Puff's romantic tail
 Noble Kings and Princes bowed low whene're they came
 Pirates lowered EVERYTHING when Puff roared out his name!

 A faggot lives for AGES, but not so little boys;
 Ding-a-lings and Faery Rings make way for other toys.
 One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
 And Puff, the tragic faggot, he ceased his fearless roar.

 His head was bent in sorrow, green tears fell like rain
 Puff no longer went to play along the "Cherry" Lane
 Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
 So Puff the tragic faggot sadly crept into his cave.

               THE BALLAD OF RICHARD III
               (Tune: "Rye Whiskey")

 I am a ramblin' hunchback, I ramble around
 I ramble thru your cities, I ramble thru your towns.
 I went into a tavern to get me some lunch
 Where all the macho stick-jocks made fun of my hunch

 Well I said sticks and stones may injure my bones,
 But names will never hurt me, so leave me alone!
 I was scratchin' my back, and when I looked up,
 A blonde, hare-lipped waitress poured coffee in my cup!

 It was love at first sight, as my brew I did sip,
 She patted my hump, as I caressed her lip!
 Lord, I left with that waitress, because, as you see,
 The womens all love my deformity!

                   THE RED FLAG
      (Tune: "O Tannenbaum," "Maryland," &c.)

 While walking 'cross the rocks so bare
 I saw a maiden lying there
 And as she lay in sweet repose
 A breath of wind blew up her clothes
         A mongol who was passing by
         Lifted his hat and winked his eye
 And then he saw, to his despair,
 She had the Red Flag waving there!

 The mongol would not be denied
 He said "By God, I'll slip inside!"
 He stripped down to his underwear,
 And soon his ass was shining bare
         The maiden she was not disturbed
         Nor in the slightest bit perterbed
 For, come what may, full well she knew,
 The brave Red Flag would see her thru!

 The mongol he was shivering
 His mighty prick was quivering.
 But soon he knew he'd met his match,
 He could not penetrate her snatch!
         Try as he might, his path was blocked,
         All he could do was fire half-cocked;
 To quit the fray he did prepare,
 And leave the goddam Red Flag there!

 The moral of this tale is plain,
 But pardon me if I explain;
 In love, or war - it matters not,
 You never, ever waste a shot!
         The mongol's judgement was at fault
         To penetrate the maiden's vault
 With Red Flag flying, let it pass:
 Just shove it up the maiden's ass!

         OPTIONAL CHORUS:

                 The peasant class can kiss my ass!
                 I've got my Peerage, now, at last!

  My pretty maid I fain would know
  What thing it is will breed delight
  That strives to stand, yet cannot go
  That feeds the mouth that cannot bite?

  Refrain:  (repeat after each verse)

  A pleasing and a standing thing
  It was the truncheon Mars did use
  A bedward bit which maidens choose

  It is a shaft of Cupid's cut
  'Twill serve to rove, to prick, to butt
  There's never a maid, but by her will,
  Will keep it in her quiver still

  It is a friar with a bald head
  A staff to beat a cuckold dead
  It is a gun which shoots point blank
  And hits betwixt a woman's flank

  It has a head much like a mole's
  And yet it loves to creep in holes
  The fairest she that e'er took life
  For love of this became a wife!

CHORUS: We are, we are, we are, we are, the goddam SCA

 And before the night is over, your maidenhood is his!

 To yell "The King's a bastard!" like his daddy used to do!

 If we find an Ansteorran man within our sacred walls
 We'll give him to the Tuchux, who'll amputate his balls
 And if that doesn't fix him up, I'll tell you what we'll do
 We'll stuff his ass with broken glass and seal it up with glue!

 Oh here's to the King of (insert Kingdom name) the dirty son of a bitch
 We hope he dies of syphilis combined with seven year itch
 If you take his pecker's radius and project his balls in space
 You can prove by Occam's Razor that his asshole is his face!

 I was at the Pennsic War a-walkin' on the green
 Lookin' for some pussy, and there I found the Queen
 Her feet were wavin' in the air, her back was on the grass
 With a polished rattan dildo shoved right up her ass!

 The West is run by pussy, and the East by hairy crack
 The Middle's run by alcohol, and the Horde is run by yak!
 From what I hear of Atenveldt, they run it off by hand
 And a masturbating son of a bitch is the Asshole of the land!

 Ansteorra runs on bullshit, Artemesia runs on quim
 Trimaris is run by fairies, that bugger Atlantia's rim!
 But Caid's the worst of all, their peckers gather rust
 They run the Kingdom off by hand with lots of fairy dust!

 If I had a prick of steel, and balls of shiny brass
 I'd find a marble statue, and ram it up her ass

                     THE SLEEPING SCOTSMAN
                              -Anonymous
                 (last 2 verses by Rich Bailey)

 A Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair
 And one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share
 He stumbled on until he could no longer keep his feet
 Then staggered off into the grass to sleep, beside the street

 CHORUS: A ring-di-diddle-e-di do, a-ring-di-diddle-i-day
         He staggered off into the grass to sleep beside the street.

         (following choruses as above, repeating last line of verse)

 A pair of young and lovely girls just happened to come by
 And one said to the other, with a twinkle in her eye:
 "You see yon sleeping Scotsman, so strong and handsome built..
 I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt?"

 They crept upon the sleeping Scotsman, quiet as could be,
 And lifted up his kilt above the waist, so they could see..
 And there, behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt
 T'was nothing but what God has graced him with upon his birth!

 They marveled for a moment, then one said: "We'd best be gone.
 But let's leave a present for our friend before we move along!"
 So as a gift, they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow,
 Around the Bonnie Star the Scottish kilt did lift and show!

 The Scotsman woke to Nature's Call, and stumbled towards a tree
 Behind the bush, he lifts his kilt, and gawks at what he sees!
 Then, in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes:
 "I ken na' whaur y'been, m'lad, but I see y'won First Prize!"

 Our Scottish friend, still dressed in kilt, continued up the street
 He hadn't gone ten yards or more, when a lass he chanced to meet.
 She said: "I've heard what's underneath there, tell me, is it so?"
 He said: "Just slip your hand up, lass, if y'really want to know!"

 So she slipped her hand right up his kilt, and much to her surprise,
 The Scotsman smiled, and a very strange look came into his eyes,
 She said: "Why, sir, that's gruesome!" And then she heard him roar:
 "If you stick yer hand up once again, you'll find it grew some more!"

 Oh, my name is Torquemada, I'm the leader of the band
 Altho we are few in numbers, we are feared throughout the land!
 We work on Jews and Protestants, we kick them as they fall,
 But when we work on heretics, we work the best of all!

 CHORUS: Oh the racks they creak, and the thumbscrews squeak
         And the whips they flail away!
         The Jesuit slams the Iron Maiden shut
         While I sit in the corner and pray!
         Oh, the auto-da-fe is God's chosen way
         And the screams of the victims are grand

    Don't laugh when you see a Duke walk by
    For you may be the next to die!

    To fight with him is suicide
    Especially if you "rhino-hide!"

    As on the field your helm caves in;
    His sword is buried down to your chin!

    They'll take you out to the family plot
    And there you'll wither, decay, and rot!

    They'll take you out, and lower you down,
    And men with shovels will gather 'round!

    They wrap you up in a big white sheet
    And bury you under about six feet!

    And all goes well for about a week
    And then the coffin begins to leak!

    The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out,
    The worms hold revels upon your snout!

    They call their friends, and their buddies, too,
    They'll make a terrible mess of you!

    Your body turns a slimey green
    And pus runs out like whipping cream!

    Your hair turns white, your skin turns blue
    You don't look like you used to do!

    Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall out,
    Your liver turns to sauerkraut!

    And great big bugs with eyes of green
    Crawl in your liver and out your spleen!

    You become a thing that's very rare
    A smell worse than your underwear!

    So don't laugh when you see a Duke walk by
    For you may be the next to die!

 It takes a nasty man, to sing a nasty song (3X)
 I'm nasty now, and I'll be nasty all night long!

 Every single morning I insist on breakfast in bed
 So my Lady wraps her legs around my head!

 I say my bedtime prayers when the Mission bell rings eight
 O send me, Lord, a girl that wants to fornicate!

 They call me short, dark and handsome butI thank God they're wrong
 How can I be short, at a full nine inches long?

 My Liege Lord says I'm slow, but his daughter doesn't mind
 It's 'cause I'm slow, that I get a little behind....!

 I've got hair everywhere, from my head down to my feet
 And in my mouth it gets stuck between my teeth!

 I'll give you some kissin', girl, every single night
 If you want more than that, the line forms to the right!

 They say you are what you eat, I answer "Is that a fact?"
 If that is true, I'm a nymphomaniac!

                (Tune: "Ruben, Ruben")

 Caviar comes from virgin sturgeon      The oyster's a prolific bivalve
 Virgin sturgeon's a mighty fine fish   Keeps its' innards in its' shell,
 Virgin sturgeon needs no urgin'        How they diddle is a riddle,
 That's why caviar is my dish!          But they do, so wotthehell!

 Shad roe comes from scarlet shad fish  The trout is just a little salmon,
 Shad fish have a very sad fate:        Just half-grown, and minus scales,
 Pregnant shad fish is a sad fish       But the trout, just like the salmon
 Got that way without a mate!           Can't get on without his tail!
  
 Mrs. Clam is optimistic                Give a thought to the happy codfish
 Shoots her eggs out in the sea         Always there when duty calls,
 Hopes her suitor is a shooter          Female cod fish is an odd fish
 Hits the selfsame spot as she!         From her come your cod fish balls!

 The green sea-turtle's mate is happy   A lucky fish is the common starfish
 With her lover's winning ways          When for offspring they essay;
 First he grips her with his flipper    Yes, me hearties, they have parties
 Then they flip for days and days!      In the good old fashioned way!

 I fed caviar to my Lady                I fed caviar to my grandpa
 She was a virgin tried and true        He was a man of ninety-three
 Now that virgin needs no urgin'        Shouts and screams were heard from
 Now there's nothin' she won't do!                                 grandma

 I fed caviar to my rooster             Every living thing will do it
 I fed caviar to my cow,                Without making lots of fuss
 Now the barnyard sure looks funny:     When they do it, they don't rue it,
 All the cows have feathers now!        So my darlin', why not us?

               WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
                     (Monty Python)

 Whenever life gets you down Mrs. Brown,
 And things seem hard or tough,
 And people are stupid, obnoxious, or daft,
 And you feel that you've had quite enough...

 Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving,
 And revolving at nine-hundred miles an hour.
 That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
 A sun that is the source of all our power.

 The Sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
 Are moving at a million miles a day,
 In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
 Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way.

 Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars,
 It's one hundred thousand light years side to side.
 It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
 But out by us it's just three thousand light years wide.

 We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point,
 We go round every two hundred million years,
 And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions (and billions...)
 In this amazing and expanding universe.

 The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
 In all of the directions it can whiz.
 As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know,
 Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.

 So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure,
 How amazingly unlikely is your birth,
 And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
 Because there's bugger all down here on earth.

                YOUNG FOLKS, OLD FOLKS
                          -Traditional

CHORUS: Young folks, old folks, everybody come
        Come to the Sunday School and have a lot of fun
        Bring a stick of chewing gum and park it at the door
        (Please check your chewing gum and razors at the door)
        And we'll tell you Bible stories like you never heard before!

  God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh
  According to the contract, it should have been the eleventh
  But the carpenters were out on strike, the masons wouldn't work
  So the foremen dug a hole and they filled it up with dirt

  When they finished with the firmament they started on the sky
  They hung it overhead and they left it there to dry
  They studded it with stars made of pretty angel's eyes
  To give us a little light when the moon forgot to rise

  God made Satan, Satan made sin
  God made a hot place to put Satan in
  Satan didn't like it so he said he wouldn't stay
  He's been acting like the devil ever since that very day!

  Adam was the first man that ever was invented
  Along came Eve, and then he was contented
  Then came the Serpent, knocking at the door
  Eve et the apple, and Adam et the core!

  Adam was a gardener and Eve, she was his spouse
  They got the sack for stealing fruit and went to keeping house
  They lived a very quiet life, and peaceful in the main
  Until they had a baby and they started raising Cain!

  Adam was the first man, we all do believe
  He had a wife and her name was Eve
  She was fair to look upon, and oh how she could dance
  And her dress was made of shredded wheat, and so were Adam's pants

  Adam had two sons who didn't quite agree
  The psychiatrists they conferred and said " 'Twas sibling rivalry!"
  One day young Cain got angry, and somehow lost his head
  Took out his Colt revolver and filled Abel full of lead!

  Noah was a mariner and sailed around the sea
  With half a dozen wives and a whole menagerie
  He tried his hand a fishing so the Bible tale confirms
  But he didn't have much luck 'cause he only had two worms!

  Methuselah was crabby 'cause he couldn't take a joke
  He had all the makings of an old and seedy bloke
  His whiskers got so long that he couldn't see ahead
  If he'd tucked in all the covers he could have used them for his bed!

  Methuselah got famous, for he refused to die
  "When ya gonna croak?" they asked, he answered, "Bye and bye!"
  And when they pressed him for the date, Methuzy whispered "Hush!"
  Then laughing thru his whiskers, he hollered "What's the rush?"

  His Daddy used to dress him in the very loudest coats

  Joseph was a pretty boy, a very handsome kid
  His boss' wife she eyed him, and straight'way flipped her lid
  She grabbed him by his you-know-what, and sat him on her lap
  But Joey wouldn't fall for that - he knew she had the clap!

  Moses was a prophet, they found him by a brook
  He was found by Pharaoh's daughter when she went in for a look
  She took him home to Father, said she found him by the shore
  Pharaoh merely smiled and said "I've heard that one before!"

  Moses was a wise old bird who knew some fancy tricks
  The 'gyppos tried some phoney stuff with magic walking sticks
  Old Pharoah he pursued him, and the Israelites did flee
  But Moses hexed the army, and drowned 'em in the sea!

  Moses was the leader of the Israelitic flock,
  He used to get spa water just by tapping on a rock.
  But then, from the multitude there came a mighty cheer,
  For instead of getting water, he got Foster's Lager beer!

  Joshua was a jazz cat - the greatest ever born
  The wall of Jericho fell down when he blew on his horn
  Pursuing all his enemies, he made the sun stand still
  The sun it wouldn't listen, so he nailed it to a hill!

  Here comes Ruth just looking all around
  Just like the girls in my home town
  Didn't wear any lipstick, or powder on her nose

  Salome was a dancer and she danced before the King
  She wiggled and she wobbled and she shook most everything
