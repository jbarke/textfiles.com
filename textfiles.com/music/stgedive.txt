* If you do a heli from 0ft you deserve this score
"Height above crowd" measured at height of dive

The dives:

Feet -  Feet-first. Lamest, also hurts a lot of people if you're wearing
        combat boots (uncool). Most first-timers are feet-firsters.
Cat  -  Jumping forward, arms and legs spread, facing the crowd, like a
        cat does when tossed in the air. The vast majority of divers fit
        this category.
Swan -  A real swan dive, with feet together and arms spread behind. Usually
        takes a lot of height to perform well.
Back -  like a swan but back-first. Aim is critical; miss the crowd and you're
        in serious pain.
Bomb -  Just like the "water-bomb" dive in a swimming pool, the idea to
        clear away as big a hole as possible. Effective in eliminating
        jerks. Timing critical - if you're seen by the crowd, it's over;
        The only one to get corked will be you.
F. Flip - Forward flip. Usually done from higher stages with tight security;
          the trick is to get your feet away from the bouncers as soon as 
          possible, hence the need for the forward flip.
B. Flip - Back Flip. Rarer than the F. Flip, usually done in haste due to
          radically changing crowd positions. Also requires greater
          gymnastic skills. 
Heli -  So named because of it's helicopter-blade-like twist, this dive
        gains the most points for sheer level of difficulty. The idea is to
        get your body whirling like a helicopter blade. Warning-highly 
        dangerous, but looks incredible. Best done from very high altitiudes.

Bonus Points:
------------

Add 2 points per dive for wild screams / arm-leg gestures.

A cat dive resulting in a handstand on the crowd adds 5 points.

Dual-diving with a partner gains 5 points each.

Negotiating your way to the top of a monitor speaker stack and diving from
there - add 5 points.

Diving on a bouncer (takes guts) - add 10 points.

Somehow getting to the light rack above the stage and diving from there
gains you 15 additional points.


Penalties -
---------

Landing on another diver, subtract 2 points.

Misdirected dive into "curious onlooker" portions of the crowd - minus 5
points.

Diving on a performer onstage - uncool! Minus 10 points.
