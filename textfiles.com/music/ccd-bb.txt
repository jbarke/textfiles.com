    Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        G7                      C    Am       Dm7       G7   C
    I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

         F              C              F                 C
    I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
          F                C   Am   Dm7     G7      C
    with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

    I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
    and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

    I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
    grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

    Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
    I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

 Hi said the Lady, dressed in green       The Circle forms, the Circle flows
 prettiest thing I've ever seen           the Circle goes where no man knows
 she went down underneath the hill        Hail to the Lady, one in three:   
 and came back out of her own free will   Present is Past and Past is Me!   
                                                                            
 Brian Boru, on Irish ground              Hi said the Lady dressed in white 
 walked three times the Island round      sang the Day and sang the Night   
 Norsemen came lookin for a fight         sang the Land and sang the Sea    
 just another Irish Saturday night!       sang the Song, and then sang Me!  
                                                                            
 Hi said Lugh on the banquet night           Salt and oil and mirror bright 
 a poet and a player and a good wheelwright  fire and fleet and candlelight 
 a harper and a warrior and none the least:  by fin and feather, leaf and tree,
 a Druid and he got in to the Feast!         fill the cup and blessed be! 

 Harold Haardrada's face was red!         From the misty crystal sea      
 Came to Britain and he wound up dead     Came the Lady to the lea        
 Stamford Bridge is where he's found      Sword and Roses in Her Hand     
 got six feet of English ground           Spread their seeds thruout the Land 

 the Legion with it's Eagles bright       Came the Stag from oaken wood       
 marched into the Pictish night           saw the Lady where she stood     
 met them there upon the sand             by the fire burning bright       
 gave em up to the Wicker Man!            came to know his heart's delight!

 eight-legged steed and hound of Hel      By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound 
 the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well       Blessed Be: the Day I've found    
 fire burn and fire spark                 Hail to the Lady, one in Three    
 are you then feared of the dark?         Present is Past and Past is WE    
                                                                            
 Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight     By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn     
 all thru the Day all thru the Night      Blessed be the Day you're born!   
 Hail to the Lady, one in Three           Fire burn and fire bright

                         LORD OF THE DANCE
     -Gwyddion PenDderwyn, Amy Falkowitz, Ann Case, Len Rosenberg

The chord "Am+G" is fingered by raising the first finger off the 2nd
string in a standard "Am" chord and then placing the little finger on
the 6th string, 3rd fret (G).

The chord "Am+B" is fingered by raising the first finger off the 2nd
string in a standard "Am" chord.

             Am
        She danced on the water, and the wind was Her horn
             G                                E7
        The Lady laughed, and everything was born
             Am                            Dm
        And when She lit the sun and its' light gave Him birth
             Am                       Am+G           E7
        The Lord of the Dance first appeared on the Earth

                  Am
      (Chorus): Dance, dance, where ever you may be
                C         G           (Bm)       E7
                I am the Lord of the Dance, you see!
                   Am     Am+B                 Am
                I live in you, and you live in Me
                       Am      Am+B       G      E7   Am
                And I lead you all in the Dance, said He!


        I danced in the morning when the World was begun
        I danced in the Moon and the Stars and the Sun
        I was called from the Darkness by the Song of the Earth
        I joined in the Song, and She gave Me the Birth!

        I dance in the Circle when the flames leap up high
        I dance in the Fire, and I never, ever, die
        I dance in the waves of the bright summer sea
        For I am the Lord of the wave's mystery

        I sleep in the kernel, and I dance in the rain
        I dance in the wind, and thru the waving grain
        And when you cut me down, I care nothing for the pain;
        In the Spring I'm the Lord of the Dance once again!

        I dance at the Sabbat when you dance out the Spell
        I dance and sing that everyone be well
        And when the dancing's over do not think that I am gone
        To live is to Dance! So I dance on, and on!

        I see the Maidens laughing as they dance in the Sun
        And I count the fruits of the Harvest, one by one
        I know the Storm is coming, but the Grain is all stored
        So I sing of the Dance of the Lady, and Her Lord:

        The Horn of the Lady cast its' sound 'cross the Plain
        The birds took the notes, and gave them back again
        Till the sound of Her music was a Song in the sky
        And to that Song there is only one reply:

        The moon in her phases, and the tides of the sea
        The movement of the Earth, and the Seasons that will be
        Are the rhythm for the dancing, and a promise thru the years
        That the Dance goes on thru all our joy, and tears

        We dance ever slower as the leaves fall and spin
        And the sound of the Horn is the wailing of the wind
        The Earth is wrapped in stillness, and we move in a trance,
        But we hold on fast to our faith in the Dance!

        The sun is in the southland and the days grow chill
        And the sound of the horn is fading on the hill
        'Tis the horn of the Hunter, as he rides across the plain
        And the Lady sleeps 'til the Spring comes again

        The Sun is in the Southland and the days lengthen fast
        And soon we will sing for the Winter that is past
        Now we light the candles and rejoice as they burn
        And we dance the Dance of the Sun's return!

        They danced in the darkness and they danced in the night
        They danced on the Earth, and everything was light
        They danced out the Darkness and they danced in the Dawn
        And the Day of that Dancing is still going on!       

        I gaze on the Heavens and I gaze on the Earth
        And I feel the pain of dying, and re-birth
        And I lift my head in gladness, and in praise 
        For the Dance of the Lord, and His Lady gay

        I dance in the stars as they whirl throughout space
        And I dance in the pulse of the veins in your face
        No dance is too great, no dance is too small,
        You can look anywhere, for I dance in them all!

                                -William IX, Count of Poitiers
                                 tune: Ioseph of Locksley

                      G                C
                I'll make some verses just for fun
                 G                 Am7 D7
                Not about me, nor anyone
                      G               C           Am7
                Nor deeds that noble Knights have done,
                     G      D7
                Nor Love's ado
                   G                C
                I made them riding, in the sun..
                     G      D7     G    (D  G)
                My horses helped, too!

                When I was born? I cannot say!
                I am not sad, I am not fey,
                I am not stiff, nor degage...
                What shall I do?
                Long since, enchanted by a Fay,
                Star-touched I grew.

                Dreaming for living I'll mistake
                Unless I'm told when I'm awake
                My heart is sad, and nigh to break
                With bitter rue
                And I don't care three crumbs of cake
                Nor even two!

                So ill am I that Death I fear
                (I nothing know but what I hear...)
                I hope there is a doctor near
                no matter who!
                If he can cure me, I'll pay dear;
                If not: He's thru!

                I have a Lady; who, or where 
                I cannot tell you, but I swear
                She treats me neither ill, nor fair,
                But I'm not blue...
                Just as the * Normans * stay...up there...
                OUT of Poitou!

                I have not seen, yet I adore
                This distant love, she sets no store
                On what I think, and furthermore...
                ('tis sad, but true)
                Others there are...some three...or four...
                I'm....faithful....to!

                I've made this verse, if you'll allow
                I think I'll pass it on right now
                To one who'll send it on, somehow,
                Up to Anjou.
                He'd tell me what it means, I vow,
                If he but knew!

                Es bleibet dabei: die Gedanken sind frei!

        Die Gendanken sind frei: my thoughts freely flower
        Die Gedanken sind frei: my thoughts give me power
        No scholar can map them, no hunter can trap them
        No man can deny: Die Gedanken sind frei!

                Ich denke was ich will, und was mich begluecket
                Doch alles in der Still, und wie es sich shicket
                Mein Wunsch und Begehren kann niemand verwehren
                Es bleibet dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

        I think as I please, and this gives me pleasure
        My concience decrees: this Right I must treasure!
        My thoughts will not cater to Duke nor Dictator
        No man can deny: Die Gedanken sind frei!

                Und sperrt man mich ein im finsteren Kerker
                Das alles sind rein vegebliche Werke;
                Denn meine Gedanken zerreissen die Schranken
                Und Mauern entzwei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

        And if tyrants take me and throw me in prison
        My thoughts will burst free, like blossoms in season!
        Foundations will crumble, the prison will tumble,
        And free men will cry: Die Gedanken sind frei!

        Es bleibet dabei: Die Gedanken Sind Frei!

                        C                Am        D7
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks

                  on rocky plains, in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days, and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt...My Atenveldt!

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         G               C                G         D7     G
      As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         G           C                G      D7            G
      I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
          G             Em               G          D7
      but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor

      (in false Gregorian Chant:)  that's the man who tells the King of 
                                   the West how to go to the bath room!
            G               C               G      D7      G
      who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

      As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
      a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
      the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
      and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

      a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
      but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
      and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
      he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

      a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
      who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
      the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
      but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

      the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
      for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
      for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
      were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

      And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
      of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
      the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
      and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

    I cannot live with broken heart; the wound you gave will kill.

    My Destiny lies on the Field, in months, or days, or years....
    And if you never loved me dear, shed not your lying tears.

    As I walked out one quiet evening
    C       Am       D7
    At the hour of twelve at night
     G                       C
    Who should I meet but a fair young maiden
     Am                  Am

    Have you seen the forest quiet,
    Or a stag that's barely born?
    Have you seen the dawn a-breakin'
    O'er the Western Ocean's tide?
    Have you felt my heart a-beatin'
    When it's held close to your side?

    I can give no gold or silver,
    I can give no fields of land,
    I can give no servants brisk
    To wait on you both foot and hand;
    I can give you wide roads callin'
    Wind and Rain, and Moon and Sun,
    Songs to sing, and love and laughter,
    Dresses made of plain home-spun.

    Come dance with me upon the greensward
    in the moonlight, in the Spring.
    Dance with me within the forest
    Dance with me within the ring!
    Earth below us, stars above us,
    Fire and water by our side,
    Dance with me within the moonlight,
    Dance with me, and be my Bride!

                   tune by Ioseph of Locksley

        This is done in a chant-like melody. Just hold an "Am" with
        occasional shifts to "Am+B", or do it in retuning DADGBD like
        Celtic Circle Dance without the "C" chord.

        What is a woman that you forsake her?
        and the hearth fire, and the home-acre?
        to go with the old, grey Widow-Maker?

        She has no house to lay a guest in
        but one chill bed for all to rest in
        that the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in

        She has no strong white arms to fold you
        but the ten times fingering weeds to hold you
        out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you

        Yet, when the signs of Summer thicken
        and the ice breaks and the birch-buds quicken
        yearly you turn from our side and sicken

        Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters
        you steal away to the lapping waters
        and look at your ship in her winter quarters

        You forget our mirth, and talk at the tables
        the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables
        to pitch her sides and go over her cables...

        Then you drive out where the storm clouds swallow
        and the sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow
        is all we have left through the months to follow

        Ah...but what is a woman that you forsake her?
        and the hearth fire, and the home-acre?
        to go with the old, grey Widow-maker?

string: 6 5 4 3 2 1

        And the King of the Huns was helmed in steel
        and rode a stallion red
        "Oh fiercely proud my fathers feel
        of me, who crowned my head
                halfway round a world in pain,
                which I did mightily win
                and surely I go to my Father's Fane
                and not to the evil Djinn!"

        And the King of Norway was helmed with wings
        and rode a stallion grey
        "Truly proud my heart now feels
        Odin gets me today!
                I died in bed, ah, but first I hung
                full many a squealing thrall
                from Odin's Tree. With Rune on tongue
                I go now to Odin's Hall!"

        Three Kings rode out thru the depths of Hell
        with a bloody-breasted Hound
        that howls above black rivers that run
        icy beneath the ground
                Three Kings a Final Judgement won
                from the High God's lips that day:
                The Devil took the Briton,
                the Djinni took the Hun,
                and Hell took Nor-o-way!

                     FLOWER OF THE DESERT
                             -Baldwin of Erebor

       G                  Am7     D7               G
       On a warm winter's evening I stopped at an Inn
                     Am7       D7        G
       I met a bold captain; a leader of men
                       Am7      D7          G
       he asked me to join him, for he was alone
                       Am7      D7               G
       and, as he was drinking, he spoke of his home

                                    G                        C     Am7
       (Chorus): Oh, Flower of the Desert full well may you boast!
                                    D7                       G
                 Proud Father-of-Kingdoms from mountains to coast!
                                    G                           C    Am7
                 the Land of the Phoenix; your works have been felt!
                                     D7        G
                 Oh Flower of the Desert: Atenveldt!

       When I was a young man and still in my prime
       My life stretched before me; I had plenty of time
       But now I'm an old man, and I number my days
       And I think of my homeland that seems so far away

       I've followed the Wars now for many a year
       Rode plenty of wenches; drank an ocean of beer
       Lived life to the fullest as a soldier must do
       but I'd trade it all, freely, for the Atenveldt blue!

       The fire died to embers; he drank steadily on
       When I woke in the morning the soldier was gone.
       But I think of his story wherever I bide
       What a beautiful Kingdom to inspire such pride!
