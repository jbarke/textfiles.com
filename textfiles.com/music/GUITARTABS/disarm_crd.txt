Acoustic guitar time.  If you've ever heard this one on the Mayonaise Dream
bootleg on the acoustic part, you can see there's not much difference, so the
chords are the only useful thing (unless someone wants to tab out the violin &
cello parts!).

8th-note strumming with 16th note parts here & there

Em7      Cadd9     G    Dsus/F#
