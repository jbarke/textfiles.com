G           C  G              D7   G
Hey, where did wo go   days when the rain came
 
          C    G             D7         G
Down in  the hollow    playing a new game
 
           C                G
Laughing, and a running, hey, hey
 
          D7     G       C
Skipping and a jumping in the misty morning fog,
 
    G       D7           C    D7             G         Em
with our hearts a thumpin' and you,  my brown eyed girl
 
C    D7        G    D7
You, my brown eyed girl
 
Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a sliding
All aling the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
 
bridge:
 
D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
 
G         C       G      D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that
 
G         C       G      D7         G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
 
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
 
Do you remember when we used to sing
 
D7   G          C
     Sha la la la la la la la
 
 
Peace, love, and soul,
Paul Zimmerman
