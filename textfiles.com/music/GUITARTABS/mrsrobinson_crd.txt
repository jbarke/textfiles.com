		E7
		We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
		A
		We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
		D               G               C           Am
		Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
		E7                          D
		Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


		CHORUS

		E7
		Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
		A
		Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
		D             G               C           Am
		It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair
		E7                        D
		Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids


		Koo koo ka choo Mrs. Robinson - CHORUS

		E7
		Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
		A
		Going to the candidates debate
		D              G              C                  Am
		Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
		E7                         D
		Any way you look at it you lose

		D              G          Em
		Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
		G                  Em             C    Am         D
		A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
		D               G        Em
		What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
		G               Em            C     Am                   E7
		Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
