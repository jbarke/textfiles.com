                               II. WHAT IS MIDI?

          1) Just what is MIDI?

          MIDI stands for "Musical Instrument Digital Interface," an
          international standard which will allow you to connect your
          synthesizer to other MIDI-equipped devices. These include
          other MIDI keyboards, personal computers, rhythm machines
          and tape recorders. You can use MIDI to connect these
          different components together, and create a personal music
          system with extraordinary capabilities.

          2) What can I do with my keyboard's MIDI capability?

          Well first of all, you can connect you MIDI keyboard to
          other MIDI keyboards. This simple connection lets you play
          both keyboards at the same time.

          &@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&D&Y in              out  &@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&D&Y

          You connect the keyboards together using MIDI cables.
          Connect the MIDI OUT on the first keyboard to the MIDI IN on
          the second keyboard. Then, When you play on the first, the
          other keyboard will play at the same time! You can use this
          simple way of connecting with MIDI cables to build a
          powerful and versatile MIDI system.

          MIDI also gives you access to the magic of personal
          computers!

          Imagine... you have a recording-studio in your living room..
          the "albums" you record are played back "live" through your
          personal music system... you create beautiful arrangements
          and compositions even though you are not a "master" musician
          or experienced arranger or composer... these works can even
          be converted into standard music notation and printed as
          your own sheet music.

          Your computerized music center even teaches music theory and
          keyboard techniques...using additional keyboards expands the
          number of "instruments" available in your "orchestra" in a
          concert of pre-recorded music for the enjoyment of you and
          your family.

          These and other possibilities allow your MIDI-keyboard to
          become an exciting and powerful component in your home
          entertainment center! Whatever your keyboard can do all by
          itself is just a hint of what is possible when you
          "computerize" it using MIDI.

          1) How can my personal computer make such a difference?

          A personal computer makes your keyboard more "intelligent",
          and expands its capabilities. Different software applications
          allow you to use your keyboard to record music, play it
          back, compose and print out songs, and even learn to play
          better!

          2) Would it be difficult to use my personal computer with my
          MIDI Keyboard?

          Not at all. The truth is that computers have become such a
          normal part of our daily lives that most of us take them for
          granted. So much so, we sometimes use computers without even
          realizing what we are doing! Automated tellers, information
          booths at airports and shopping malls, and vidio-games are
          but a few examples of computers we use day-in and day-out.

          Connecting your personal computer and MIDI keyboard is
          simple, too. You do it with the help of Two MIDI cables and
          a "MIDI Interface". This interface plugs into your computer
          and allows it to "Speak MIDI".

          The secret to having fun with the computer in your home is
          to choose "user friendly" software. In other words, good
          software should be easy to use, helpful and "friendly" to
          the people who use it.

          3) Exactly what is software?

          Software lets you tell the computer what you want it to do.
          The different tasks a computer can be asked to perform are
          called  "applications". When the applications are musical,
          your personal computer requires music software. The
          capabilities of your MIDI music system will depend on which
          software applications you choose to use.






          4) What are the different music software applications?

          There are four categories of music software:
          a) Music Entertainment Software
          b) Music Education Software
          c) Performance/Recording Software
          d) Music Printing Software.

          Each category of music software allows your MIDI keyboard to
          do something different!

          Music entertainment software lets you play your favorite
          songs on your MIDI-keyboard while your computer plays
          pre-arranged accompaniment and rhythm parts!

          Music education software helps you to develop your knowledge
          of music and improve your playing skills by transforming
          your MIDI music system into a teaching studio.

          Performance/recording software turns you into the
          producer/engineer of your own digital recording studio...you
          make recordings of original compositions and arrangements
          while your personal computer plays back "live" on your
          MIDI-keyboards.

          Music printing software converts these and other
          performances into printed sheet music for almost any
          combination of instruments and voices!


          IV. POPULAR MIDI SETUPS.


          The simplest way to use MIDI is to connect one or more
          instruments together using MIDI cables.

          The next step with MIDI is a system involving your MIDI
          keyboard, personal computer,home stereo and vidio monitor.
          This system provides the basic components of a computerized
          MIDI system and is useful for Music Entertainment, Music
          Education, and simple Performance and recording
          applications. Your MIDI keyboard and personal computer are
          connected with the help of two MIDI cables and a "MIDI
          Interface:. This interface plugs into your computer and
          allows it to "Speak MIDI".
