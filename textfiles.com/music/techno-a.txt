THE TECHNO REVOLUTION - Simon Reynolds
------------------------------------------
Four Years after its invention in a Detroit bedroom, techno is now
dominating dance floors from London to LA. Is it the next musical
insurrection or is it just danceable noise? Simon Reynolds reports.
 
  MIdnight, saturday and I am pushing through a jungle of limbs in the
fluorescent grottoes that make up the LABRYNTH, a hardcore techno club in
northeast London. The ultraviolet light makes teeth glow with an eerie,
extraterrestial hue. It also highlights the dancers drug ravaged
complexions. But then in a rave culture spots are sexy.
 First thing you notice is every other boy wearing a woolly bobble hat(a
sock cap with or without a pom), despite the fact that it's a sauna in
here. My guide tells me that the hats help bring on hyperventilation. Next
you notice a lot of kids who seem to have the flu-rubbing vicks VapoRub on
their necks, or passing around tubes of a nasal decongestant spray. In
fact, it's another Ecstacy enhancer. The tingle of the ointment and the
menthol fumes increase the buzz of X-tacy. 
 The Labryth mostly hosts young white Kids from London's East End and from
Essex, two of the UK's techno strongholds. Although both are very much part
of the rave culture, techno is quite different from house music. It's
almost entirely non-vocal and has little relation to disco or black pop
tradition. There are many types of Techno, but right now the dominant force
is hardcore which is fast paced (130-140 Beats Per Minute,BPM"s..house
clocks in at 120 bpm), heavy bass, and melody free.
 Next we hit the Breakfast Club in central London, which starts at 5:00am
and goes on until midday Sunday. Despite an intensive body search on
entrance, there's no shortage of disreputable types whispering offers of
"whizz"(speed), "charly"(cocaine), and various brands of "X" or
"E"(Ecstacy). The dance floor resembles something between a Nuremberg Rally
and a soccer match. Apocalyptic and bombastic, the music's an ambush of
sound, fury, and blaring samples that enforces a new kind of dancing: all
twitches and jerks, like disciplined epilepsy. Close cropped boys move like
they are doing kung fu with an invisible adversary, others mold their hands
into the shape of cocked pistols and let them rip.
 Drugs are essential. Most tablets sold as Ecstacy are concoctions of
amphetamines cut with LSD or Valium. Some kids "neck"(swallow) as many as
five X pills a night. Speed promotes megalomania and agression rather than
the tactile intimacy of X. You can see the difference on the dance floor.
The kids seem lost in autistic bliss, and you get the idea that they'd
rather be masturbating than screwing. Pleasure is expressed in slang terms:
On a good night, you're "faced"(off your face), "sledgied"(into oblivion),
"cabbaged"(brain dead). 
 Complaining that it is to fast to dance to, the older rave crowd dismisses
hardcore techno as the "new heavy metal". They prefer the more song
oriented garage trax. The youth call it "that garage shit" and is just
bland jazz-funk. The battle lines have been drawn.
---------
 The Techno story begins in the late 70's in Detroit, when three young
black American friends, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Juan Atkins,
were electrified by the sound of KRAFTWERK"s "Trans-Europe Express." The
Three became Europhiles and futurists, infatuated with Ultravox, Depeche
Mode, New Order - groups whose cold precision was in stark opposition to
black music's passion and warmth.
 Juan Atkins was the first to make music as early as 1981 with the
electro-era outfit CYBOTRON, and then in 1985 as MODEL 500. Soon
afterwards, Kevin Saunderson (as Reese and Inner City) and Derrick May (as
Mayday and Rythm is Rythm) also began recording tracks in their bedrooms.
But in Detroit Techno remained a small subculture with never more than a
few hundred followers. 
 Nonetheless, their tracks went on to spawn a huge British Subculture. Neil
Rushton, a british pop entrepeneur sold the idea of "Detroit Techno"
compilation to TEN Records, while Saunderson's pop-techno band, Inner City
had two huge world wide hits with "Big Fun" and "Good Life". Then things
started to go wrong. Disillusioned , Juan Atkins and May dropped out of
music and Saunderson led Inner City in a disastrous soul direction. But
still a seed had been planted.
 The 90's brought in a new breed of U.K. whiz kids who made records in
their bedrooms using cheap samplers and outmoded analog synths and who were
fired up by a do-it yourself fervor reminiscent of punk. Warp Records in
Sheffield was a hot bed of talent, with groups like Forgemasters, Sweet
Excorcist, and the brilliant LFO. Then came out of Manchester, A GUY CALLED
GERALD, and 808 STATE. But the finest moment in the early scene came with
Orbital's "Chime" a shimmering hymn that was recorded  in a few hours for
less than a hundred dollars and went on to become a top twenty hit on the
club charts. 
 The hardcore mentality picked up in 1991. These days any music illiterate
can cobble together a white-label twelve inch by tossing a few samples over
a looped , sped-up breakbeat. The market has been flooded with obscure,
limited edition white-labels, which are highly prized by Dj's competing to
play the latest tracks regardless of their longterm worth.
 ALTERN-8's Mark Archer and Chris Peat started out by making "arm-chair
techno" but shortly after moved into hardcore techno. Wearing outfits made
of chemical warfare protection suits and face masks, Altern-8 are KLF like
pranksters. Their Top three hit "Activ-8" featured a sample of their label
boss's 5 year old daughter saying "nice one, top one, get sorted" a slang
phrase for getting high on Ecstacy that bypassed the BBC sensors. And when
they appeared on a british TV program called "On top of the Pops" they
convinced the camera man to zoom in on a jar of Vicks placed ontop of their
sampler, the equivalent of waving a cocaine spoon on prime time TV. Their
latest single "Evapor-8" cheekily manages to compact two drug references
into a single word.
----------
 SPIRAL TRIBE is a loosely knit collective that organizes illegal parties
and outdoor raves while simultaneously recording and ditributing their own
white-label tracks. They are part of the crossover between the rave scene
and the "crusty" subculture (sqaut dwelling nouveau hippies, anarcho-punks,
and slackers who got the name "crusty" from their matted dreadlocks and
hobo garb.)
 Hoping to interview the Tribe, I find myself in a dilapidated squat in
northeast London. Ten Years ago a sqaut party would have been dub reggae or
hippie rock, but tonight it's thick techno-voodoo rythm's. Downstairs
assorted figures huddle, rolling joints or snorting ketamine, a brain
deadening anesthetic that is suddenly back in favor. Currently slang terms
for the drug are "baby food" (users sink into a blissful inertia) and "God"
(some are convinced they have met their maker).
 The Tribe's spokeman is Mark, who expounds their anarcho-mystical creed
with the gleam of a prophet in his eyes. "We keep everything illegal
because it's only outside the law that there is any real life to be had.
Last summer we did a party that went on for fourteen days. It's a myth that
you need to sleep. Stay awake and you discover the real edges of reality.
You stop believing all the false reality that was hammered into you from
birth."
 In the week I've been chasing them for an interveiw, Spiral Tribe have
been lying low. After a rave in rural Wiltshire, thirty-four members were
arrested, their vehicles trashed by the cops and their phone-line they use
to publicize their events cut off. However the Tribe are gearing up to
launch a non-stop conflagration of illegal raves, and most likely more
altercations with the police. Kicking it off will be SOUND SYTEM CITY on
June 21, a massive rave near Stonehenge - traditionally the summer
celebration place for hippies and pagan worshippers until police placed a 4
mile exclusion zone around it a few years ago.
 Like alot of Apocalyptic sects, Spiral Tribe combine paranoid conspiracy
theories with fantasies of returning to a lost golden age. They call their
philosophy "terra-technic" and hope to use technology to unleash the
primordial power of the earth. "Like music from non-western cultures,
techno's based on harmony and rythm, not melody," says Seb, one Tribalist,
"We're not trying to get into the future. We're trying to get back to where
we were before western civilization fucked it all up."
---------------------------------
Today Belgium is at the crossroads of the global traffic in Techno-music.
Since 1990 Belgium has unleashed a steady stream of hardcore tunes that
have incited something akin to pandemonium on the dance floors of Britain,
Europe, and America. R&S Records, the country's leading Techno label is run
by Renaat and Sabine Van De Papeliere, a husband and wife team who last
year sold more 12'inch singles in Belgium than all other labels combined.
 The belgian story began with a late 80's dance craze called "New Beat".
Dj's started to spin house records at 33rpm rather than 45rpm creating an
eerie trance dance groove. When groups like LORDS OF ACID and A SPLIT
SECOND inorporated that slow motion beat, they became huge hits in Belgium
and ended that country's pop inferiority complex. As the 90's kicked in the
beats per minute accelerated as Dj's began playing techno with their
turntables set to plus eight. With groups like T99, Second Phase, Rythm
Device, a native hardcore was born charcaterized by the "Belgian Hoover"
effect(sound), an ominous drone that sounds like a swarm of bees. Renaat
thinks it's implicitly utopian, allowing people to create their perfect
world on the dance floor."Because there are no words, it leaves your
imagination free. You can escape from everything." While Belgium still
leads the way with the music, Renaat says the frontiers of club life are
being pushed back in Rotterdam, Frankfurt, and Berlin, where Dj's are
talking about a merciless 180 bpm's as a goal. He mentions one club in
Cologne where temperatures reach tropical levels and Dj's wear oxygen
masks. And he dreams of one day holding a Techno-woodstock modelled also on
Berlin's annual rave carnival , the Love Parade. Apparently last years
MAYDAY rave attracted over 30,000 people.
----------------------
In the beginning of this century, the Italian futurists worshipped
technology and speed and prophesied a new music based on the art of noises.
In the century's last decade, young Italian Americans in New York worship
the velocity and noise that is Techno, and they congregate at Limelight for
"Dance Energy" (on Thursdays) and Lord Michael's "Future Shock" (on
Fridays).
 "Fifty percent of the kids are just into the music," says Lord Michael,
the promoter/producer who introduced techno to the Staten Island
/Bensonhurst crowd and then lured them into the Manhattan clubs. "They get
off on the agression, cause New York's a very agressive city. The other
fifty percent are taking Ecstacy or acid. Some of them smoke PCP.It's
Wild."
 These days the New York Techno scene has opened out somewhat. "Most come
from outside Manhattan," says MOBY, a Techno artist and occasional Dj at
"Future Shock"(on Fridays). At 26, MOBY is relatively old for a techno whiz
kid. A former punk who breifly played in the seminal drone-rock band
Flipper. Moby is also a Christain Vegan who abstains from alchohol and
drugs. "I'm ascetic, but I love drug culture. I prefer adrenaline highs,
but I like being in a nightclub where five thousand people are buzzing. As
for my religious beliefs...well, the first Rave was when the Ark of the
Covenant was brought into Jerusalem and King David tore off all his clothes
and danced like crazy."
-------------------------------
In New York Techno may be a form of psychic release , a way of venting the
tensions of urban life. But in San Francisco, some ravers see it as part of
a spiritual revolution. Acid guru Timothy Leary's ideas about "the
politics of Ecstacy" are being adapted for the computer age by a new
generation of heads and freaks, and they're hoping that the rave experience
will bring on a blissed-out of state of "higher understanding". "They are
calling Dj's digital shamens on the west coast," says Todd Roberts,
associate editor of the L.A. dance music magazine URB. Like the
terra-technics, it's all about using futuristic technology to return to the
ancient purpose of music: communal release through ritual , ecstatic
dancing.
 While Los Angeles has the most highley developed rave culture in the U.S.,
the accent there is on a certain fashion-conscious hedonism rather than
mystical enlightenment. Ecstacy and LSD are big, but so are crystal meth
and nitrous oxide(laughing gas) - drugs that deliver a buzz but hardly open
the doors of perception. 
 Techno is being consumed by hordes of suburban kids looking for a new
underground sound (now that the so called alternative rock, from Nirvana to
Nine Inch Nails, has gone mainstream). They are into it because it's
confrontational and agressive , a new way to shock the sqaures and it
hasn't been co-opted yet. So on Friday or Saturday they hit three or four
raves (each numbering between three to five thousand people) before the sun
rises over the Valley. Then they drive through the streets having had the
time of their lives only wanting more. With Techno you can never drive fast
enough to catch up with the Beat.
