Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin (yay! toot!)

there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
and when she gets there she knows
if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
 
there's a sign on the wall
but she wants to be sure
cause you know sometimes words have no meaning
in a tree by a brook there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
 
there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke though the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
 
and it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter
 
and it makes me wonder
 
if there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may-queen
yes there are two paths you can go by
but in the long run there's still time to change the road you're on
 
Your head is humming and it won't go - in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
dear lady can you hear the wind blow
and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind
 
and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all
to be a rock and not to roll
