        THE BALL OF BALLYKNURE (AKA: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS)
                -supposedly Robert Burns; dates from the 1880's

(1)     Oh the Ball, the Ball of Ballyknure
        Where your wife, and my wife, were doin' it on the floor!

        (chorus) Wha' do ya, lassie?
                 and wha' do y'noo?
                 I'm the man what did y'last, lass,
                 I canna do y'noo!

        The Queen was in the parlour, eatin bread and honey
        The King was in the chambermaid, and she was in the money!

        The village idiot he was there, a-sittin' by the fire
        Attempting masturbation with an india-rubber tyre!

        Oh the village postman he was there, but he had the Pox
        He couldna' do the ladies so he did the letter-box!

        The Queen of England she was there, backed against the wall
        "Put yer money on the table, boys, I'm going ta do you all!"

        The Count and Countess, they were there, a-doin' on the stair
        The bannister broke, and down they fell, they finished in mid-air!

        There was music in the garden, there was music in the sticks
        You couldna' hear the music for the swishin' o' the pricks!

        They were doin' it on the landing, they were doin' it on the stairs
        You couldna' see the carpet for the wealth of pubic hairs!

        The Kingdom Herald, he was there, whattya think o'that?
        Blazoning positions wi' a Duchess and a cat!

(10)    The fubba-wubbas they were there, sittin' all alone
        Complainin of the doin's with loud and piercing moans!

        Mr. Jameison he was there, the one that fought the Boers
        He jumped up on the table and he shouted for the hoors!

        The Board of Directors they were there, and they were shocked to see
        Four-and-twenty maidenheads a-hangin' from a tree!

        John the Blacksmith he was there, he wouldna play the game
        He did a lassie seven times, but wouldna see her hame!

        The village Constable he was there, now whattya think o'that?
        Amusin' himself by abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat...

        Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

        It started out so simple-like: each lad and lassie mated
        But pretty soon the doin's got so bloody complicated!

        Four and twenty virgins came down from Cuinimore
        Only two got back again, and they were double-bore!

        Clan MacChluarain, they were there, sleepin in the shade
        For no one could decide if they were Man, or Sheep, or Maid!

        The village pervert he was there, scratchin' at his crotch
        But no one minded him at all, he was only there to watch!

        The Kingdom Seneshal was there, linin' 'em up in rows
        He didna use his pecker, lads, he did 'em with his toes!

(20)    The village cripple he was there, but he didna shag too much
        His old John Thomas had fallen off, so he did 'em with his crutch!

        The old schoolteacher he was there, he diddled by rule-of-thumb
        workin' logarithmicly the times that he would come!

        The village chimney-sweep was there, a really filthy brute
        For every time he farted, he covered 'em all with soot!

        The local Cavaliers were there, in elegance they sat
        A-doin' Things Unusual with the feathers in their hat!

        The Rapier-fighters they were there, doin' what they could
        A-thrustin' and a-parryin' with Real Steel, not with wood!

        The local Hordesmen they were there, busier than bees
        the ladies wouldna have 'em, so they diddled dogs and trees!

        The village carpenter he was there, with his prick of wood
        He made it when he lost his own, and it worked just as good!

        The shenai-fighters they were there, all wrapped up in smiles
        A-doin' everyone they could in Oriental style!

        The College of Heralds they were there, in the other room
        Arguin' about who would do what, with which, to whom!

        The rattan-jocks were out in force and they were such a sight
        They didna do the ladies 'cause they'd heard there was a fight!

(30)    The old fishmonger he was there, a dirty stinkin sod
        He never got a rise that night, so he diddled 'em with a cod!

        The Kingdom Laurels they were there, and quite a sight to see
        A-doin' everyone they could, and most artisticly!

        The Kingdom Pelicans were there, doin' it with a sob
        They diddled out of duty; it was just another job!

        Four and twenty virgins went down to Inverness
        And when the Ball was over, there were four and twenty less!

        There was doin's on the porches, and doin's on the stones
        You couldna' hear the music for the loud and joyful moans!

        (insert name) he was there, covered up with smiles
        Doin' thirty-two at once, and in amazing style!

        All the Kingdom spodes were there, but they just sat and sulked
        For this was the occasion that no one told them "Get fulked!"

        Clan MacChluarain they were there, chasin' round the Keep
        And every single man of them buggerin' a sheep!

        (insert name) had a gerbil, he diddled it very well
        He didn't wrap it in duct tape: he blew it all to hell!

        (insert name) he was there, with his favourite toys:
        A dozen beautiful women, and a dozen beautiful boys!

(40)    (insert name) he was there; he wasn't very nice
        He didna do the ladies, he did gerbils, rats and mice!

        (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
        Takin' on all comers, and she hasn't finished yet!

        (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
        The Dark Horde carried her away, and we ain't found her yet!

        The Locksley Monsters they were there, lookin' for some nookie
        But they got distracted by a chocolate chippie cookie!

        (insert name) he was there, a crafty friend of Ghengis,
        He speaks a lot of languages; he is a cunning linguist!

        The village Masochist, he was there, beggin' for some blows
        The Sadist merely looked at him, and softly answered "No!"

        Yang the Nauseating was sittin' out in back
        The ladies did na' want him for he smelled too much of yak!

        The village druggist he was there, grinnin' like a fox
        He'd sold out of condoms, so he sold 'em dirty socks!

        Buell the Kind was also there, that beggar meek and mild,
        He didna' do the ladies, he had brought his favourite child!

        (insert name) he was there at the revel feast
        He doesn't like the girls, and the boys call him "The Beast!"

(50)    And in the morning, early, the Farmer nearly shat
        For four and twenty acres was nearly fuckit flat!

        It was a grand old party, lads, and sure a Locksley Plot
        And every lad and lassie there was glad of what they got!

        And when the Ball was over, everyone confessed
        The music it was wonderful, but the "doin's" were the best!

        She loosened a stay
        In her decollette
        Exposing her je ne sais quoi!             (T)

        There once was an old man of Lyme
        Who married three wives at a time
        When asked: "Why a third?"

        "And bigamy, sir, is a crime!"         (T)           * more *

        Waltz Me Around Again, Hrothgar (cont.)

        The Revel lasts all of the night
        Lords and ladies in finery bedight
        The music doth swell
        The dancers look well
        Once they learn their left foot from their right!    (E)

        There once was a knight from the Middle
        Who wanted to learn how to diddle
        In the East, at his ease,
        He caught a disease:
        And now he can't even piddle!                (I)

        A randy young man from Caid
        Was discovered spreading his seed
        In horses and dogs,
        In owls and in frogs,
        And in two or three slow-moving Swedes!      (I)

        At least if you're in the Dark Horde
        You will never sit 'round being bored
        Our ladies, and wives.
        Tend to carry sharp knives....
        First get their permission, my lord!         (U)

        A lusty old Duke, at Estrella
        Was behaving in ways I won't say-a
        In his BVDs
        Duct-taped to a tree
        He woke up the very next day-a!              (I)
 
        Address all unknowns as gentle
        Treat ladies as tho' sacramental
        Unless their bare arms,
        Loose behavior, and charms
        Proclaim that their favours are rentals!     (E)

        Don't ever drink Caidan Blue
        It'll getcha as nothing else do!
        A pirate one day
        Drank two, so they say,
        Just look at that boy gork and spew!         (I)

        There once was a young knight from Kent
        Whose thing was so long that it bent!
        To save himself trouble
        He'd put it in double,
        And instead of coming, he went!              (T)

        The trouble with list'ning to Yang
        Was that every damned song the man sang
        Was either illicit,
        immoral, explicit,
        Or in lower Mongolian slang!                 (E)

        There was a young lady named Banker
        Who slept with the Corsairs, at anchor!
        She awoke in dismay
        When she heard someone say:
        "Now, up with the top's'l and spanker!"      (U)

        A serious thought for today
        Is one that may cause dismay:
        Just what are the forces
        That bring little horses
        If all the big horses say "Neigh?"           (U)

        There was a young man from Racine
        Who invented a "Doing Machine"
        Concave and convex
        It could "do" either sex,
        But oh, what a bastard to clean!             (T)

        There was a young couple named Kelly
        Who walked around belly-to-belly
        Because, in their haste,
        They used library paste
        Instead of petroleum jelly!                  (T)

        At the Revel last night down in Crewe
        I found a large mouse in the stew
        Said the waiter "Don't shout,
        And wave it about,
        Or the King will be wanting one, too!"       (T)

        There was a young lady named Greene
        Who grew so abnormally lean
        And flat and compressed
        That her back touched her chest
        And sideways, she couldn't be seen!          (T)

        A certain young man from An Tir
        Sat down, and cried in his beer,
        His lady, he said,
        Wore chain-mail to bed
        And it took off the hair round his peer      (I)

        There once was a knight from the Mists
        Who cockily entered the lists
        A Duke soon uncocked him,
        Dehorned and defrocked him,
        He got screwed, but never was kissed!        (I)

        If you kiss enough frogs, so they say,
        One might be a Prince, some fine day,
        But beware of the dude
        Who is uncouth, and lewd:
        He's a horny toad, and a bad lay!            (I)

        A certain young Herald so charming
        Had Arms that were very alarming:
        A maiden, displayed,
        On a bed, disarrayed,
        And the motto: "Foreplay is forearming!"              (I)

        You can fight the Dark Horde, if you wanna
        You'll find plenty of blood, guts, and honnah
        While you turn them quite green
        With your shieldwork supreme
        Look out for that left-hand katana!         (E)

        The East, or the Mid, (It depends!)
        Remarks when the Horde condescends
        To march into place
        With sword, spear and mace:
        "Your friends? I thought they were our friends!"      (E)

        Now Ysgithrs' all in a riot
        They've never been peaceful and quiet
        We'd turn it to slag

        Or sell it, but nobody'd buy it!          (U)

        A Meridian lady, they say.
        Was made a peculiar way:
        She took forty-two strokes
        And three dirty jokes
        And a gallon of mead every day!           (U)

        Ansteorra's a place in a rut
        Delighted to wallow in smut!
        They use dirty socks

        And do, well, I mustn't say what!         (U)

        As I gazed at the heavens one night
        The cracks in the sky caused me fright!
        Pieces came down!
        Fell all over town!
        I guess Chicken Little was right!         (J)

        God's plan had a hopeful beginning
        But Man spoiled his chances by sinning
        We trust that the story
        Will end up in Glory
        But, at present, the Other side's winning....     (T)

        And now we have got to The End
