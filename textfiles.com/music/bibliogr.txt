Here's the list of books I received from various sources from around the
world. Some of these may be out of print, and some may not be published
in all countrys. I don't know about the contents of the books, I've
only compiled this list.

A big thanks to all the submitters, both direct and indirect. Cheers.

Enjoy,

a new book recently has appeared on my desk, which i find quite exciting,
and would like to tell you about.
the book is volume 8 in the computer music and digital audio series
edited by our old buddy john strawn and published by a-r editions,
and is by far the best of the series as far as scope and depth are
concerned.
it is called Synthesizer Performance And Realtime Techniques, and is
authored by jeff pressing, about whom i know nothing.
allow me to provide a chapter listing, with sub-chapter brief:

1: the synthesizer as instrument
      fixed and realtime synthesis
      the improvisation-composition continuum
      aesthetics, style, and function
2: synthesis, sampling, and software
      tuning and temperament
      synthesis and sampling
      musical qualities and synthesis
3: midi
      midi messages
      standard midi files
      midi diagnosis
      limitations of midi
4: synthesizer technique
      contemporary synthesizer keyboard technique
      voice assignment: monophonic and polyphonic modes
      velocity and pressure maps
      performance with standard continuous controllers
5: playing a single line
      realtime control of pitch
      timing
      timbre
      articulation and phrasing
      notation for synthesizer
      the synthetic implementation of expressivity
6: polyphonic performance and extended techniques
      part disposition
      dovetail voicings
      polyphonic pitch bend
      keyboard retuning
      velocity effects
      using unpredictability
7: performance configurations and practicalities
      layering
      practical issues in live performance
      live performance with prerecorded music
8: sound and instrument imitation
      sustaining breath instruments: brass and winds
      the voice
      decaying instruments: plucked strings
      instrumental third-streaming
9: nonkeyboard controllers
      pitch-to-midi converters
      bowed string controllers
      percussion controllers
10: synthesizer ensembles and repertoire
      discographical sources
      performance problems in electroacoustic ensembles
11: intelligent and interactive performance systems
      an analytical and historical framework
      cybernetics of the control interface
      cybernetics if intelligent midi systems

the book is comprehensively indexed, and runs to 462 pages. now, even in that
many pages some of the above areas get a little shortchanged. i'm sure that
most of you could, after all, see an entire book in each chapter heading.
things like midi diagnosis and controller descriptions actually only get
a single page, rather than any kind of serious treatment. what the book excels
in, however, is a musically relevant presentation. it is full of score
material, data, and exercises. as you can tell from the chapter list,
it builds from a set of synthesis and related fundamentals to a core which
emphasizes how to actually make music with these instruments, and then
resolves to more abstract issues of sound design and control. the book is
written for the musician who may know absolutely nothing about synthesizers
to begin with, and attempts to tell them everything they need to know in
order to make both rational and creative decisions. on the one hand, this
means that a good deal of the writing simply makes explicit what alot of
us who have been using these machines for years already understand, although
may not have bothered to articulate. descriptions of portamento control, for
instance, tend toward this. they are very detailed, but tell me nothing
new. but again, and this is the other hand, they are *very* detailed, and
this level of detail sometimes triggers new ideas even for the familiar reader.
the treatments of the requirements, capabilities, and implications of
performance controls and techniques is the most thorough i have ever seen,
and i think anyone here would find significant value in it.

New, advanced MIDI desk reference is perfect for programmers and MIDI power
users.  The heart of the book is a summary and explanation of every MIDI
command, in hex, binary, decimal and English.  Also features detailed
discussion of software design concerns, synchronization formats, MTC,
sample dump, MIDI files and system exclusive processing.

It discusses writing software to handle MIDI information at the application
level.  In other words, they assume you have already written or otherwise
obtained access to the necessary code to talk to your hardware to send and
receive the MIDI data.  This approach frees the entire discussion from
being tied to any particular hardware or programming approach.  Instead, it
spends its time on that which is valuable to the experienced programmer.
Issues such as MIDI file format, timing (SMPTE, MTC, etc), parsing MIDI
data and processing it, MIDI sample dump standard, etc. are all handled in
fine detail.

THE MIDI IMPLEMENTATION BOOK, Defuria & Scacciaferro
Contains complete documentation of MIDI commands implemented by more than
200 instruments.  This data has come directly from hardware manufacturers
and allows you to find MIDI functions of specific instruments, compare
features of similar instruments and choose equipment to meet specific
applications.  A standard, one-page implementation chart is used for each
product.  1986, 216 pp. $19.95

Joseph Rothstein, _MIDI:  A Comprehensive Introduction_
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Microsoft Press put out a book on midi programming.  I
   think that this is rather a weak book, but it might serve
   as an introduction for non-computer folk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Several other books are out that were written by musicians.
   They are interesting as a intro to using midi, but contain
   a dearth of info from my perspective.  As a programmer, I
   have the wrong perspective to sort these out.

This covers analog and digital sound synthesis from an experimenter's
perspective, not much math, lots of algorithms and circuits.  If you want
to solder and program in your garage and make lots of weird sounds, this is
the bible.  Lots of BASIC programs, but they're very short, just to
demonstrate algorithms.  It's a few years old now and the electronic
devices used in the book are dated, but the explanations and principles are
still valid.  It discusses things such as real time synthesis, play back of
stored soundwaves, sampling, running multiple D-As in parallel, software
for computing soundwaves (it even covers Fast Fourier Transforms) and more.

I found the Howard Massey "Sysnthesists Guide to Acoustic Instruments"
to be a pretty good book for general synthesizer knowledge, mostly
because it doesn't try to explain the specifics of a synth.

Moorer, James A. and Grey, John: "Lexicon of Analyzed Tones";
Computer Music Journal, volume 1 Number 2, volume 1 number 3,
volume 2 number 2, volume 2 number 3, and continuing

The first installment of the lexicon was an analysis of a violin tone.
The second analyzed Clarinet and Oboe tones, and the third presented an
analysis of a trumpet tone.

These analyses included spectral plots (time versus amplitude for the first
21 partials), spectrographic plots (frequency versus amplitude), and amplitude
and frequency versus time plots for the first sixteen partials.  Additional
information is given about formants of the instruments and the analysis
and resynthesis methods which the authors used (The analysis was done with
a Heterodyne Filter algorithm).  While the authors claim that the tones
were resynthesized and were nearly indistinguishable from the originals, they
ARE only single, specific notes played on a specific example of the original
instrument, so, while they would be a good starting point for re-synthesis of
an instrument, they are by no means sufficient.

 Subjects: Computer composition.
     ISBN: 0-89579-256-7 (hardcover)

The book includes (LISP) source code to significant parts of his EMI
system (Experiments in Musical Intelligence). For the non-technical reader
there is a brief introduction to LISP programming.  There are numerous
examples of programs applied to examples from musical literature, (Bach,
Mozart, Schubert, Stravinsky and many others). The program produces an
analysis of the regularities in two or more pieces of the same style and
uses these as "signiatures" to generate a new piece in that style. Cope's
methodology is derived from a mixture of classical AI (or rule based)
models and linguistic grammars (Augmented Transition Network).

The results are interesting and can be remarkable. But I have to add that
there are significant problems with the methods. The system seems good at
capturing very local phenomena, (such as cadence formulae), but is
ill-conditioned for capturing more global aspects of musical structure
(such as melodic coherence, harmonic interest, &c). These problems have
been acknowledged by the author but I think they are unsolvable in the
current working paradigm.

MUSIC AND CONNECTIONISM is now available from MIT Press.  This 280-pp. book
contains a wide variety of recent research in the applications of neural
networks and other connectionist methods to the problems of musical listening
and understanding, performance, composition, and aesthetics.  It consists of a
core of articles that originally appeared in the Computer Music Journal, along
with several new articles by Kohonen, Mozer, Bharucha, and others, and new
addenda to the original articles describing the authors' most recent work.
Topics covered range from models of psychological processing of pitches,
chords, and melodies, to algorithmic composition and performance factors.  A
wide variety of connectionist models are employed as well, including
back-propagation in time, Kohonen feature maps, ART networks, and Jordan- and
Elman-style networks.  We've also included a discussion generated by the
Computer Music Journal articles on the use and place of connectionist systems
in artistic endeavors.  A more detailed description of the book is provided
below (from the jacket text), along with the complete table of contents.

MUSIC AND CONNECTIONISM can be found in bookstores that carry MIT Press
publications, or can be purchased directly from MIT Press by calling their
toll-free order number, 1-800-356-0343, and giving the operator this catalog
number: 1CSAT 503, and this book code: TODMH.  By phone and mail-order, the
price is $39.95; in stores, it will probably be $45 (there is some confusion
with the publisher on this point, so I wanted to give out the detailed
information for phone orders to save people some money).
******************************************************************************
                           Music and Connectionism
                  edited by Peter M. Todd and D. Gareth Loy

As one of our highest expressions of thought and creativity, music has always
been a difficult realm to capture, model, and understand.  The connectionist
paradigm, now beginning to provide insights into many realms of human
behavior, offers a new and unified viewpoint from which to investigate the
subtleties of musical experience.  Music and Connectionism provides a
fresh approach to both fields, using techniques of connectionism and parallel
distributed processing to look at a wide range of topics in music research,
from pitch perception to chord fingering to composition.

The contributors, leading researchers in both music psychology and neural
networks, address the challenges and opportunities of musical applications of
network models.  The result is a current and thorough survey that advances our
understanding of musical perception, cognition, composition, and performance
and of the design and analysis of networks.

Music and Connectionism is based on a core of articles originally appearing as
two special issues of the Computer Music Journal.  These have been augmented
with addenda covering more recent research by the authors.  The book opens
with tutorial chapters introducing neural networks in a musical context and
relevant aspects of previous computer music research, making this a
self-contained text.  There are many new chapters, along with new section
introductions, summaries of related work, and a final debate on the artistic
implications of connectionist methods.

Peter M. Todd is a doctoral candidate in the PDP Research Group of the
Psychology Department at Stanford University.  Gareth Loy DMA is an
award-winning composer, member of the Board of Directors of the Computer Music
Association, lecturer in the Music Department of UC San Diego, and member of

                             BOOK ANNONNCEMENT

Representations of Musical Signals
edited by Giovanni De Poli, Aldo Piccialli, and Curtis Roads
Published by MIT Press, 1991
ISBN 0-262-04113-8, 478 pages, hardcover, US$ 50.00

Representations of Musical Signals describes a new generation of digital
audio and computer music systems made possible by recent advances in
digital signal processing theory, hardware design, and programming
techniques. It explores new representations of musical signals that can
have profund effects on the way musicians conceive of and realize musical
ideas. In particular, the book focuses on models that combine time-domain
and frequency-domain representations (grains, wavelets, and physical
models), visual programming and advanced user interfaces, and that
incorporate musical knowledge using artificial intelligence techniques and
adaptive neural net- works.  The 14 contributions take up issues of how
musical signals should be displayed to musicians, engineers, and scientists
who want to work with them, how professionals can work with the
representations to accomplish musical tasks, how systems can be designed to
permit working with multiple views of the same signal, and how representa-
tions of musical signals should be organized to promote efficient
communication between devices using these signals.

Representations of Musical Signals is aimed at the expanding group of
musicians, engineers, and scientists who are interested in innovative
approache to digital audio and computer music. We expect that this book
will be useful in undergraduate and graduate courses in computer music,
musical acoustics, and digital audio signal processing.

Giovanni De Poli is a member of the faculty of the Department of
Electronics and Informatics at the University of Padua.  Aldo Piccialli is
a member of the faculty of the Department of Physics at the University of
Naples. Curtis Roads is a composer and consulting editor of Computer Music
Journal.

NEW BOOK ON COMPUTER MUSIC, MUSIC COGNITION AND AI

The research presented in "Music, Mind and Machine: Studies in Computer
Music, Music Cognition and Artificial Intelligence" by Peter Desain and
Henkjan Honing finds its basis in the fields of musicology, psychology and
computer science. Nowadays each of these domains is linked to the other in
various research disciplines. In computer music, ways to design machines to
make music are explored. In music cognition, mental processes that perceive
and apprehend music are investigated. In artificial intelligence the mind is
approached as a machine - and machines are built to learn more about the
mind.

The articles collected in this volume focus on the perception and
representation of musical time and temporal structure, commonly identified
as a research area crucial to the understanding of the complex processes that
enable us to enjoy and perform music. Most of the theories are illustrated
with small concrete computer programs. As such it could serve as a text book
for courses in the field of computer music and music cognition.

Peter Desain and Henkjan Honing have collaborated for the last seven years
at the City University, London and the Centre for Knowledge Technology,
Utrecht. They combine their different backgrounds in computer science,
psychology, and music, and share a fascination with the computational
modelling approach to music perception and performance. Peter Desain
currently works on rhythm perception at the University of Nijmegen,
Henkjan Honing does research on the formalisation of musical knowledge at
the University of Amsterdam.

Interactive Music Systems
Machine Listening and Composing
Robert Rowe

For the growing number of professionals in computer music -- composers,
performers, and teachers -- who are looking for more from the computer
music systems that are now available, _Interactive Music Systems_ provides
the first comprehensive survey and evaluation of new computer programs that
can analyze and compose music in live performance.

Although Rowe focuses primarily on musical motivations and possibilities of
interactive systems, he also takes up such practical considerations as how
to build, analyze, and extend these systems, and he looks at the impact of
music theory, music cognition, and artificial intelligence on the design of
interactive systems and on ensemble performance. He describes in detail
both the theory and practice of his own real-time interactive music
program, Cypher, and further illustrates basic concepts and characteristic
issues using the graphic MIDI programming environment Max.

In a concluding chapter, Rowe assesses developments in hardware and
software with implications for the evolution of interactive systems,
including their implementation in multiple-processor environments, the
impact of real-time digital signal processing, and extended prospects for
sensing performance gesture.

Interactive Music Systems CD-ROM This supplement to Interactive Music
Systems contains audio and program examples that document a variety of
systems and the music they produce. An extensive library of Macintosh
software allows the user to experiment with or adapt existing interactive
systems.  Some parts of the library require the presence of underlying
software environments, such as SmallTalk, LISP, or Opcode's Max language.
The program discussed most extensively in the text, Robert Rowe's Cypher,
will run on any Macintosh computer with no additional software required.

Both the book ($35) and the CD-ROM ($19.95) can be ordered from The MIT

Machine Models of Music
>From Minsky to Mozart
edited by Stephan Schwanauer and David Levitt
Cambridge: MIT Press, 1993
ISBN 0-262-19319-1 $45

Machine Models of Music brings together representative models ranging from
Mozart's "Musical Dice Game" to a classical article by Marvin Minksy and
current research to illustrate the rich impact that artificial intelligence
has had on the understanding and composition of traditional music and to
demonstrate the ways in which music can push the boundaries of traditional AI
research.

The authors include prominent figures in linguistics (Johan Sundberg,
Ray Jackendoff), computer science and AI (Fred Brooks, Marvin Minsky,
Terry Winograd, Herbert Simon, Peter Neumann), music theory (Allen
Forte), composition (Fred Lerdahl, Charles Ames), psychoacoustics
(Christopher Longuet-Higgins, Jamshed Bharucha), and the odd middle
ground of "computer music" (James Moorer, Hiller and Isaacson).

relating to the application of object-oriented (OO) software
technology--the most important new software engineering technology
of the 1980s--to various musical applications. It consists of
articles from Computer Music Journal 4(4), 8(5), 10(4) and 13(2)
along with new chapters and updates to the original texts as
addenda. The authors describe the application of OO technology to
a wide range of areas of computer music and digital audio signal
processing including music representation and composition, real-
time performance, and digital signal processing (DSP). A number of
popular OO programming languages are represented, including Lisp,
Smalltalk-80, and ObjectiveC.

                MUSIC, SOUND and TECHNOLOGY
                by John M. Eargle. (A mini-review)
is published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, copyright 1990. Its Library
of Congress number is ML3805.E2 1990.

        This little book turned up on the New Titles shelf in the Physics
and Planetary Science Library at Pitt recently, and I've just finished going
through it. It was a worthwhile enough bit of reading matter that I thought
I'd bring it to the List's attention. This ain't no formal book review, but
then again you all probably knew that already, knowing me, right?

        MS&T is a fairly technical treatment of the acoustics of musical
instruments, almost exlcusively focussing on acoustic instruments that are
featured in the modern orchestral format (hence including a lot of unusual
jazz instruments and percussion devices). It has fairly little math in it,
and requires little or no math background to read, but it does not skimp
on the ideas it brings across-- a novice who knew something about music,
having read this book carefully, would come away with a better understanding
of music and acoustics than many professional sound engineers probably have.
(Based on my own experiences in the field, that is.) The style is a trifle
dry, but is never so technical as to be unreadable. Examples from the public
domain are liberally sprinkled throughout the book, and every chapter ends
with a small bibliography and reference list, often including phonorecords.

        The book begins with a brief review of the physical principles
underlying the creation of sound: waves, sound pressure, units like the
decibel, and so on. Virtually all of the math in the book is contained here,
and it's on the high-school level, not too daunting. Some of the stuff is
quite simple (masses on springs, pendula), but the reader suddenly finds
himself absorbing stuff like "Relations between Direct and Reverberant Fields"
--and understanding it clearly! The organization is clear, and every concept
is prefaced with an explanation of why and where it's important. The next
two chapters complete what Eargle considers the introductory part of the book;
one is on the physiology of hearing and psychoacoustics, ranging from the
localization of sound by the ears and head to the cultural biases inherent in
judging what constitutes "consonance" and "dissonance," and the other is a
brief but relatively well-thought-out review of temperament and tuning scales.

        Chapters 4 through 9 are explanations of the physics of the usual
sorts of sound generators one would find in orchestral of jazz music, and
comparative studies of their pitch and loudness ranges, harmonic structure,
and expressive characteristics in relation to the player's abilities. Strings,
woodwinds, brasses, and percussion devices are given their own chapters, and
keyboards are lumped together in one chapter, despite their differences in
sound creation (which Eargle acknowledges but views as less important than
their similarities). There are all sorts of little gems here-- how to change
the speaking length of a trumpet, what happens to the frequency response of
a piano when you close the lid, how a vibraphone differs from a marimba, etc.
These chapters alone make the book worth a look.

        Chapter 10 explains the philosophy behind the physical organization of
musical ensembles. Why the first and second violins are sometimes seated
together on the left, other times separated, and so on. Chapter 11 is a long
and occasionally quite technical discussion of performance space design, and
of the engineering of suitable halls for speech, music, and worship (there's
a big section on church design). Chapters 12 and 13 discuss the principles of
sound reinforcement and sound recording, with diagrams of speaker placements
and microphone patterns abounding; this is getting into the sort of stuff that
we tend to deal with regularly in EMUSIC-L, and we may have seen it elsewhere,
but at this point we're used to Eargle's delivery and it's more clear than the
usual drek in Home and Studio Recording. Some of the discussion is quite
fascinating (is it better to be shamefully accurate or to correct for acoustic
weaknesses when recording a symphony?), and the material is quite modern in
its presentation: Eargle notes "with nostalgia" the passing of the vinyl LP
from the scene. Overdubbing, Digital recording, and signal processing are
touched on in a straightforward manner, from quad sound systems to delay and
digital reverb. Chapter 14 is a primer on home audio, with explanations of
the LP, cassette, and CD as playback media and commentary on speaker systems.

        Chapter 15 is what you've all been waiting for, the "Overview of Music
Synthesis." It covers the acoustics of transients, steady-state conditions,
and tonal decay, ensemble considerations, working in the frequency vs. the
time domain, and mentions modern developments such as sampling and MIDI. The
entire section is only eight pages long, half of which are figures, but for
the acoustic musician who's unfamiliar with and a bit scared of synthesizers
it's a very easily digestible introduction. The acoustic musician sighs with
relief and says, "So THAT'S all there is to it!" (Of course, it isn't, but it
serves to keep the musician's mind open and unafraid of future learning.) The
author seems to regard these instruments with some degree of wide-eyed wonder,
and perhaps some nervous condescention as well, but he never fails to
recognize them as instruments in their own right, deserving of attention
beside the violins and piccolos. His only classicist comment, which is
probably forgivable under the circumstances, is that "Electronically generated
sounds do not necessarily have to imitate those of traditional instruments,
but the sounds do have to fit into musical contexts." (We'll shelve arguments
on that point for other posts, ok?) The last chapter is a brief touch upon
active noise reduction principles and techniques, and probably should have
been placed between chapters 13 and 14, but at least it's there, if only for
six pages.

        The book weighs in at 290 pages with a reasonably thorough index, and
is published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, copyright 1990. Its Library
of Congress number is ML3805.E2 1990. I consider it a refreshing change from
the constant jabber about whether the Amiga can beat the Mac in the MIDI world
or what goes into Differential Loop Modulation in the D-70. It's clear,
readable, and has a lot of worthwhile data that can be put to good use by a
clever musician, electronic or otherwise. Metlay says, check it out.

The July 1991 issue of _Computer_, (Vol 24, #7, ISSN 0018-9162), published by
the IEEE Computer Society, has the title "Computer Generated Music", and a
whole bunch of neat articles.

Titles of articles, are followed by Authors, then a description.
(taken from the table of contents)

_Guest Editor's Introduction: Computer Generated Music_
        Denis L. Baggi

_Formula: A Programming Language for Expressive Computer Music_
        David P. Anderson and Ron Kuivila

        Formula, a language for controlling synthesizers, can model the
        expressiveness of a human performance.  It supports algorithmic
        composition, interactive performance, and programmed interpretation
        of traditional scores.

_Recombinant Music: Using the Computer to Explore Musical Style_
        David Cope

        A Computer program that creates new but stylistically recognizable
        music from existing works offers insights into the elusive
        phenomenon of musical style.

_Toward an Expert System for Expressive Musical Performance_
        Margaret L. Johnson

        An expert system processes the melodies of Bach fugues using a model
        that recognizes rhythmic patterns.  It outputs instructions that
        tell performers how to articulate the melodies.

_Fugue: A Functional Language for Sound Synthesis_
        Roger B. Dannenberg, Christopher Lee Fraley, and Peter Velikonja

        Fugue provides functions to create and manipulate sounds as abstract,
        immutable objects.  The interactive language supports behavioral
        abstraction, so composers can manage complex musical structures.

_A Computer Music System that Follows a Human Conductor_
        Hideyuki Morita, Shuji Hashimoto, and Sadamu Ohteru

        An electronic orchestra with a complex performance database and
        MIDI controllers responds to the gestures of a conductor through
        a CCD camera and a sensor glove.

_Project Overviews: Current Research in Computer Generated Music_
        Stephen W. Smoliar, Goffredo Haus, Alberto Sametti, Denis L. Baggi,
        Antonio Camurri, Corrado Canepa, Marcello Frixione, Renato Zaccaria,
        Yap Siong Chua, and Robert Keefe

        Six overviews reflect varied ongoing research.  Reporting from
        such diverse locales as Singapore, Europe, and the US, the authors
        explore the spheres of computer-aided composition, synthesis of
        musical scores, computer simulation, and composing by musical
        analog.

The six overviews look more interesting than the description.  Of course,
all of the above articles have references, so you can go look up more
information.

Although the Walter PIston Orchestration text is good and still worthy
of consultation, as a teacher of Orchestration I feel it has been
replaced by the Samuel Adler book entitled THE STUDY OF ORCHESTRATION.
 This book comes with a workbook that is well organized and should be
possible to use in self-study more.  Another good text for taking
piano scores and orchestrating them is Joseph Wagner's book
ORCHESTRATION: A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK.  It also comes with a workbook
and is easier to use in self-study mode than the Adler.  Whatever you
do, do not go for the Rimsky Korsakov text PRINCIPLES OF
ORCHESTRATION.  It is an excellent text but in the Dover format is
useful only to those with a good working knowledge of orchestration.
Hope this helps.

** >Is there anybody on the world, who can help me to find a book
** >"Foundations of Sound Synthesis" by John Chowning ?


** These are the only references I have for Chowning:

** J. Chowning
** "The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency
** Modulation"
** J. Audio Eng. Soc. 21, no. 7 (1973):526-534
** [This is the standard reference.]

----> yes, but in "Foundations..." (where nb. this paper is reprinted)
      there are his newer concepts of more complexive FM synthesis, which
      I'm looking for...

** J. Chowning and D. Bristow
** "FM Theory and Applications by Musicians for Musicians"
** Yamaha Music Foundation, Tokyo, 1986
** ISBN 4-636-17482-8

----> thanx for this, it sounds interesting, especialy because of YAMAHA's
      activity in the field of FM.

In addition: I have found an interesting paper about reconstruction algorithm
for FM natural sound simulating. If anybody is still interested in FM
synthesis, but in software means, please to contact. I'm going to work at
smart program for converting sampled sound to DX's programm parameters.
