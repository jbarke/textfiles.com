     Auto Decree and Auto Decree Implementing Regulations

1.   Subject to this Appendix, Mexico may maintain, until January
1, 2004, the Decree for Development and Modernization of the
Automotive Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Modernizaci¢n de
la Industria Automotriz") (December 11, 1989) (the "Auto Decree")
and the Resolution that Establishes Rules for the Implementation
of the Auto Decree ("Acuerdo que Determina Reglas para la
Aplicaci¢n para el Fomento y Modernizaci¢n de la Industria
Automotriz") (November 30, 1990) (the "Auto Decree Implementing
Regulations").  Mexico may adopt or maintain any measure
respecting automotive goods or manufacturers of automotive goods
in its territory provided that such measure is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

     Autoparts Industry, National Suppliers and Independent
Maquiladoras

2.   Mexico may not require that an enterprise attain a level of
national value added in excess of 20 percent of its total sales
as one of the conditions to qualify as a national supplier or
enterprise of the autoparts industry.

2a.  For purposes of paragraph 2, "national value added" means
the total value of sales of such enterprises (excluding those for
the aftermarket) minus the value of its total imports, direct and
indirect, excluding those imports incorporated in aftermarket
parts and components, as modified by paragraph 3.

3.   Mexico may require that a national supplier or an enterprise
of the autoparts industry, in calculating its national value
added solely for the purposes of paragraph 2, include customs
duties in the value of imports incorporated into the parts and
components produced by such enterprises. 

4.   Mexico shall grant national supplier status to an
independent maquiladora that requests such status and meets the
requirements for that status set out in the existing Auto Decree. 
Mexico shall continue to grant to all independent maquiladoras
that request national supplier status all existing rights and
privileges accorded to independent maquiladoras under the
existing Decree for the Promotion and Operation of the
Maquiladora Export Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Operaci¢n
de la Industria Maquiladora de Exportaci¢n") (December 22, 1989)
(the "Maquiladora Decree").  

4a.  For purposes of paragraph 4, "independent maquiladora" means
an enterprise registered as an export maquiladora enterprise
under the Maquiladora Decree which has no common majority
shareholder with any manufacturer, and for which no manufacturer
is directly or indirectly a majority shareholder.

     National Value Added

5.   Mexico may provide that a manufacturer ("empresa de la
industria terminal") calculate its required national value added
from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of:

     (a) a manufacturer's reference value as defined in
 paragraph 8; or

     (b) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt),

whichever is greater.

6.   Mexico shall not require that the percentage referred to in
paragraph 5 be greater than:

     (a) 34 percent for each of the first five years beginning
 January 1, 1994;

     (b) 33 percent for 1999;

     (c) 32 percent for 2000;

     (d) 31 percent for 2001;

     (e) 30 percent for 2002; and

     (f) 29 percent for 2003.

7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Mexico shall allow a
manufacturer that produced vehicles in Mexico before model year
1992 to use as its percentage referred to in paragraph 5 the
ratio of actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) to
total national value added (VANt) that such manufacturer attained
in model year 1992, for so long as that ratio is lower than the
applicable percentage specified under paragraph 6.  In
determining such ratio for 1992, purchases that such manufacturer
made from independent maquiladoras that would have been eligible
to receive national supplier status had paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of
this Appendix been in effect at that time, shall be included in
the calculation of the manufacturer's national value added from
suppliers (VANp), in the same manner as parts and components from
any other national supplier or enterprise of the autoparts
industry.

8.   "The annual reference value for a manufacturer" ("reference
value") shall be:

     (a) for each of the years 1994 through 1997, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 65 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value;

     (b) for each of the years 1998 through 2000, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 60 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value; and

     (c) for each of the years 2001 through 2003, the base value
 for the manufacturer, plus no more than 50 percent of
 the difference between the manufacturer's total sales
 in Mexico in that year and its base value.

9.   Mexico shall provide that where a manufacturer's total sales
in Mexico in a year are lower than its base value, the reference
value for such manufacturer for that year shall be equal to the
manufacturer's total value of sales in Mexico for the year.

9a.  For purposes of paragraphs 8 and 9:

     (a) "base value" means the average annual value of the
 manufacturer's production in Mexico for sale in Mexico
 (VTVd) in model years 1991 and 1992, adjusted for
 inflation, using the Mexican producer price index for
 automotive goods published by the Bank of Mexico
 ("Banco de Mexico"); and

     (b) "manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year"
 means the invoice value of sales by a manufacturer of
 vehicles it produced in Mexico for sale in Mexico plus
 the invoice value of its sales of imported vehicles.

10.  In the event an abnormal production disruption affects a
manufacturer's production capability, Mexico shall allow such
manufacturer to seek a reduction in its reference value before
the Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission, established
under Chapter V of the Auto Decree.  If the Commission finds that
the production capability of the manufacturer has been impaired
by such an abnormal production disruption, the Commission shall
reduce the manufacturer's reference value in an amount
commensurate to such event. 

10a. For purposes of paragraph 10, "abnormal production
disruption" means a disruption in a manufacturer's production
capability resulting from a natural disaster, fire, explosion or
other unforeseen event beyond the manufacturer's control.

11.  If, upon the request of a manufacturer, the Intersecretariat
Automotive Industry Commission finds that the production
capability of such manufacturer has been significantly disrupted
as a result of a major retooling or plant conversion in the
facilities of the manufacturer, the Commission shall reduce the
reference value for the manufacturer for that year in an amount
commensurate with the disruption, provided that such reduction in
that manufacturer's required national value added from suppliers
(VANp) that may result from the Commission's determination to
lower the manufacturer's reference value shall be fully made up
by the manufacturer over the following two model years.  

11a.  For purposes of paragraph 11, "significant disruption"
means a sizable impairment in the manufacturer's production
capability that lasts at least six months but no longer than 12
months. 

     Trade Balance

12.  Mexico shall not require a manufacturer to include in the
calculation of its trade balance (S) a percentage of the value of
direct and indirect imports of parts and components that such
manufacturer incorporated into vehicles it has produced in Mexico
for sale in Mexico (VTVd) in the corresponding year, greater than
the following:

     (a) 80 percent for 1994; 

     (b) 77.2 percent for 1995;
     
     (c) 74.4 percent for 1996;

     (d) 71.6 percent for 1997;

     (e) 68.9 percent for 1998;

     (f) 66.1 percent for 1999; 

     (g) 63.3 percent for 2000;

     (h) 60.5 percent for 2001;

     (i) 57.7 percent for 2002; and

     (j) 55.0 percent for 2003.

13.  For purposes of determining a manufacturer's total national
value added (VANt), paragraph 12 shall not apply to the
calculation of its trade balance (S).

14.  Mexico shall permit a manufacturer with a surplus in its
extended trade balance to divide its extended trade balance by
the applicable percentages in paragraph 12 to determine the value
of new vehicles that it may import.

15.  Mexico shall provide that in the calculation of a
manufacturer's adjustment factor (Y) in its extended trade
balance:

     (a) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt) be
 replaced by that manufacturer's reference value in any
 year in which the manufacturer's total national value
 added (VANt) is lower than its reference value; and

     (b) the applicable percentage under paragraphs 6 or 7, as
 appropriate, be used.

16.  In determining the annual amount that a manufacturer may
apply to its extended trade balance from surpluses earned prior
to model year 1991, Mexico shall in any given year allow such
manufacturer to elect:

     (a) to use the procedures of the existing Auto Decree
 Implementing Regulation; or

     (b) to apply up to $US 150 million, adjusted for inflation
 in accordance with the U.S. GDP Price Deflator or its
 equivalent in Mexican pesos, 

until such surpluses have been exhausted.

     Other Restrictions in the Auto Decree

17.  Mexico shall eliminate the restriction set out in the
existing Auto Decree that limits the number of vehicles that a
manufacturer may import into Mexico in relation to the total
number of vehicles that such manufacturer sells in Mexico. 

     Autotransportation Decree and Autotransportation
Implementing Regulations

18.  Mexico shall eliminate the Mexican Decree for Development
and Modernization of the Autotransportation Vehicle Manufacturing
Industry (December 1989) ("Decreto para el Fomento y
Modernizaci¢n de la Industria Manufacturera de Vehiculos de
Autotransporte") (the "Autotransportation Decree") and the
Resolution that Establishes Rules for the Implementation of the
Autotransportation Decree (November 1990) ("Acuerdo que Establece
Reglas de Aplicacion del Decreto para el Fomento y Modernizaci¢n
de la Industria Manufacturera de Veh¡culos de Autotransporte")
(the "Autotransportation Decree Implementing Regulations"). 
Mexico may adopt or maintain any measure respecting
autotransportation vehicles or manufacturers of
autotransportation vehicles in its territory provided that such
measure is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

19.  Except as provided in paragraphs 20 and 21, Mexico may adopt
or maintain a prohibition or restriction on the importation of
autotransportation vehicles of another Party until January 1,
1999.

20.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow
any manufacturer of autotransportation vehicles to import, for
each type of autotransportation vehicle, a quantity of
originating autotransportation vehicles equal to at least 50
percent of the number of vehicles of such type that such
manufacturer produced in Mexico in that year.  

20a.  For purposes of paragraph 20, "manufacturer of
autotransportation vehicles" means an enterprise, established in
Mexico, that produces autotransportation vehicles, is registered
with the Ministry of Trade and Industrial Development
("Secretar¡a de Comercia y Fomento Industrial"), and whose sales
in Mexico incorporate at least 40 percent national value added,
where national value added is the result of subtracting from the
total sales (excluding imports of autotransportation vehicles) of
an autotransportation manufacturer the invoice value of its
direct and indirect imports of parts and components.

21.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow
persons other than manufacturers of autotransportation vehicles
to import, in a quantity to be allocated among them, originating
autotransportation vehicles of each type as follows:

     (a) for each of the years 1994 and 1995, no less than 15
 percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of
 autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico;

     (b) for 1996, no less than 20 percent of the total number
 of vehicles of each type of autotransportation vehicle
 produced in Mexico; and

     (c) for each of the years 1997 and 1998, no less than 30
 percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of
 autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico.

1.   This Annex applies to the textile and apparel goods set out
in Appendix 1.1.

2.   In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and
the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles
(Multifiber Arrangement), as amended and extended, including any
amendment or extension after the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, or any other existing or future agreement applicable
to trade in textile or apparel goods, this Agreement shall
prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, unless the Parties
agree otherwise.


Section 2:  Tariff Elimination

1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement , each Party
shall progressively eliminate its customs duties on originating
goods as provided in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2, in
accordance with Appendix 2.1.

2.   (a) For purposes of this Annex, a good shall be considered
 to be an originating good if the applicable change in
 tariff classification has been satisfied in the
 territory of one or more of the Parties, as provided by
 Article 404.

     (b) For purposes of determining which rate of duty and
 staging category is applicable to an originating
 textile or apparel good, a good shall be a good of the
 Party in which the last substantial transformation
 occurred, according to each importing Party's
 regulations, practices or procedures or, in the event

 312(1), setting out rules applicable to textile and
 apparel goods for determining whether a good is a good
 of a Party ("Marking Rules"), according to such
 agreement.

3.   Each Party shall provide duty-free treatment for the

effect upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement may be
maintained, notwithstanding Article 309.

2.   Each Party shall eliminate a restriction or consultation
level on a textile or apparel good that otherwise would be
permitted under this Annex if the elimination of that restriction
is required as a result of integration of that good into the GATT
pursuant to commitments undertaken by that Party under any
successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement.


Section 4:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Tariff Actions)

1.   During the transition period only, if, as a result of the
reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this
Agreement, an originating textile or apparel good, or a good that
has been integrated into the GATT pursuant to a commitment
undertaken by a Party under any successor agreement to the
Multifiber Arrangement and entered under a tariff preference
level set out in Appendix 6.0, is being imported into the
territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in
absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good,
and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual
threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or
directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent
necessary to remedy the damage or actual threat thereof:
 
     (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty
 provided for under this Agreement on such good; or

     (b) increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not
 to exceed the lesser of:

     (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty
 in effect at the time the action is taken, or

     (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day
 immediately preceding the date of entry into force
 of this Agreement.

2.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the
Party shall:

     (a) examine the effect of increased imports on the
 particular industry, as reflected in the following
 factors, none of which is necessarily decisive: 
 changes in such relevant economic variables as output,
 productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories,
 market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic
 prices, profits and investment; and 

     (b) not consider changes in technology or consumer
 preference as factors supporting a determination of
 serious damage or actual threat thereof. 

3.   The following conditions and limitations shall apply to any
emergency action taken pursuant to this Section:

     (a) a Party shall deliver without delay to any Party that
 may be affected written notice of intent to take such
 action, and shall enter into consultations with that
 Party upon request;

     (b) no action may be maintained for a period exceeding
 three years or, except with the consent of the Party
 against whose good the action is taken, have effect
 beyond the expiration of the transition period;

     (c) no action may be taken by a Party against any
 particular originating good more than once during the
 transition period; and

     (d) upon the termination of the action, the rate of duty
 shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule for
 that staged elimination of the tariff, would have been
 in effect a year after the commencement of the action,
 and commencing January 1 of the year following the
 termination of the action, at the option of the Party
 that has taken the action:

     (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the schedule in
 that Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2, or

     (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual
 stages ending on the date set forth in that
 Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2 for the
 elimination of the tariff.

4.   A Party taking an action under this Section shall provide,
to the Party against whose good the action is taken, mutually
agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions
having substantially equivalent trade effects on the other Party,
or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to
result from the action.  Such concessions shall be limited to the
textile and apparel goods listed in Appendix 1.1, unless the
Parties otherwise agree.  If the concerned Parties are unable to
agree on compensation, the exporting Party may take tariff action
having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken
under this Section against any goods imported from the Party that
initiated the action pursuant to this Section.  The Party taking
such tariff action shall only apply it for the minimum period
necessary to achieve such substantially equivalent effects.


Section 5:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Quantitative
Restrictions)

1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except
Appendix 5.2, a Party may take bilateral emergency action against
non-originating goods of another Party in accordance with this
Section and the provisions of Appendix 3.1.

2.   If a Party considers that non-originating textile and
apparel goods, including goods entered under the tariff
preference levels (TPLs) set out in Appendix 6.0, are being
imported into its territory from a Party in such increased
quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market,
so as to cause serious damage or actual threat thereof, to a
domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good
in the importing Party, that Party may request consultations with
another Party with a view to eliminating the serious damage or
actual threat thereof.

3.   The Party requesting consultations shall include in its
request for consultations the reasons that it considers
demonstrate that such serious damage or actual threat to its
domestic industry is resulting from the imports of the other
Party, including the latest data concerning such damage or
threat.

4.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the
Party shall apply the provisions of paragraph 2, Section 4.

5.   The concerned Parties shall commence consultations within 60
days following the request for consultations and shall endeavor
to agree on a mutually satisfactory level of restraint on exports
of the particular good within 90 days of the request, unless the
consulting Parties agree to extend this period.  In reaching a
mutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the consulting
Parties shall:

     (a) consider the situation in the market in the importing
 Party;

     (b) consider the history of trade in textile and apparel
 goods between the consulting Parties, including the
 previous levels of trade; and

     (c) ensure that textile and apparel goods imported from the
 territory of another Party are accorded equitable
 treatment as compared with treatment granted to other
 non-Party suppliers of like textile and apparel goods.

6.   If the Parties do not agree on a mutually satisfactory level
during the 90-day consultation period, the Party requesting
consultations may impose annual quantitative restrictions on
imports of the good from the territory of the other Party for a
period no longer than that provided for in paragraph 9, provided
that:

     (a) the measure shall not have effect beyond the transition
 period; and

     (b) the quantitative restriction shall not be less than the
 sum of

     (i) the quantity of the good imported into its
 territory from the Party that would be affected by
 the restriction, as reported in general import
 statistics, during the first 12 of the most recent
 14 months preceding the month in which the request
 for consultations was made, and

     (ii) an additional 20 percent of such quantity for
 cotton, man-made fiber and other non-cotton
 vegetable fiber good categories and six percent
 for wool good categories.

7.   The first term of any quantitative restriction imposed under
paragraph 6 shall commence on the day following the request for
consultations and terminate at the end of the calendar year in
which the quantitative restriction was imposed.  Any quantitative
restriction that is imposed for a term less than 12 months and
the applicable flexibility provisions shall be prorated to
correspond to the period of time remaining in the calendar year
in which the restriction is imposed.

8.   For each successive calendar year that the quantitative
restriction imposed under paragraph 6 remains in effect, the
Party imposing it shall: 

     (a) increase by 6 percent restrictions on cotton, man-made
 fiber and non-cotton vegetable fiber textile and
 apparel goods and by 2 percent restrictions on wool
 textile and apparel goods;

     (b) accelerate the growth rate for quantitative
 restrictions on cotton, man-made fiber and non-cotton
 vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods if required
 by any successor agreement to the Multifiber
 Arrangement; and

     (c) apply the flexibility provisions set forth in Appendix
 3.1, as appropriate.

9.   Quantitative restrictions established pursuant to paragraph
6 before July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place
for the initial prorated period in the first calendar year, plus
two additional calendar years.  Such restrictions established on
or after July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place
for the initial prorated period plus three additional calendar
years.

10.  No Party may take an emergency action under this Section
with respect to any textile or apparel non-originating good that
is already subject to a quantitative restriction.

11.  No party may adopt or maintain a quantitative restriction
under this Section on a textile or apparel good if that good has
been integrated into the GATT as a result of commitments
undertaken by that Party pursuant to any successor agreement to
the Multifiber Arrangement.

12.  A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the
expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of serious
damage to domestic industry arising from the operation of this
Agreement only with the consent of the Party against whose good
the action would be taken.


Section 6:  Special Provisions

     A Party shall treat the textile or apparel goods of another
Party set out in Appendix 6.0 in accordance with the provisions
therein.


Section 7:  Review and Revision of Rules of Origin

1.   (a) The Parties shall monitor the effects of the
 application of the rule of origin contained in Annex
 401.1 applicable to goods of subheading 6212.10.  No
 earlier than 15 months after the date of entry into
 force of this Agreement, any Party may request
 consultations to seek a mutually satisfactory solution
 to any difficulties that it considers results from the
 application of that rule of origin.

     (b) If the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory
 solution through consultations within 90 days of a
 request for consultations, any Party may request that
 the rule applicable to subheading 6212.10 be changed to
 the rule applicable to headings 62.06 through 62.11 of
 the Harmonized System (HS) with respect to trade with
 the requesting Party.  Any such change shall be
 effective no earlier than 180 days following the
 request therefor.  The Parties shall take measures to
 ease any resulting administrative burden on producers.

     (c) Unless otherwise agreed, at any time after the initial
 consultations, and within the transition period of this
 Agreement, any Party may make one request for
 additional consultations under the same procedures
 provided in paragraphs (a) and (b).

2.   (a) At the request of any Party, the Parties shall consult
 to consider whether specific goods should be made
 subject to different rules of origin in order to
 address issues of availability of supply of fibers,
 yarns or fabrics within the free trade area.

     (b) In the consultations, each Party shall consider all
 data presented by a Party showing substantial
 production in its territory for a good submitted for
 review.  A legitimate claim of substantial production
 of the good in the territory of a Party shall be deemed
 to exist if that Party can show that its domestic
 producers are capable of supplying commercial
 quantities of the good in a timely manner.

     (c) The Parties shall make every effort to conclude
 consultations within sixty days.  Any agreement between
 two or more Parties resulting from these consultations
 shall be considered part of this Agreement.  If
 agreement is not reached, the Parties have recourse to
 the provisions of paragraph 8(a) of Appendix 6.6. 

     (d) In this context, at the request of any Party, the
 Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of
 origin applicable to the following provisions in Annex
 401.1 should be amended in view of increasing
 availability of supply of relevant yarns or fabrics
 within the free trade area; 

     (i) Canadian tariff item 5407.60.10, United States
 tariff item 5407.60.22 and Mexican tariff item
 5407.60.02, 

     (ii) provisions (i) through (viii) of the rule for
 subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30, 

     (iii) note 2 to Chapter 61, 

     (iv) note 2 to Chapter 62, and 

     (v) Canadian tariff item 6303.92.a1, United States
 tariff item 6303.92.h1 and Mexican tariff item
 6303.92.x1.

3.   The Parties shall review the rules of origin applicable to
textile and apparel goods within five years after the date of
entry into force of this Agreement to take into account the
effect of increasing global competition on textile and apparel
goods, and the implications of any integration into the GATT of
textile and apparel goods pursuant to any successor agreement to
the Multifiber Arrangement.  The Parties shall give particular
consideration to operative rules in other economic association or
integration agreements and developments related to textile and
apparel production and trade between the Parties and worldwide.


Section 8:  Labelling Requirements

     To facilitate trade in textile and apparel goods between the
Parties through the harmonization of domestic labelling
requirements and the elimination of unnecessary obstacles to
trade resulting from differences in such requirements, the
Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods
established under Article 913(5) shall perform the functions set
out in Annex 913-D.


Section 9:  Trade in Worn Clothing and Other Worn Articles

1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Worn
Clothing comprising representatives of each Party. The purpose of
the Committee shall be to assess the potential effects that may
result from the elimination of restrictions, maintained by a
Party prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement, on
trade in worn clothing and other worn articles as defined in the
heading 63.09 of the HS.  This Committee shall:

     (a) include or consult with a broadly representative group
 from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in each
 Party; and

consider the potential benefits and risks that may be derived
from the elimination of restrictions on trade between the Parties
in worn clothing and other worn articles, including the effects
on business and employment opportunities, and on the market for
textile and apparel goods in each Party.

3.   Notwithstanding Article 309 and paragraph 2 of Section 3, a
Party may maintain restrictions in effect upon the date of entry
into force of this Agreement on the importation of worn clothing
and other worn articles classified under heading 63.09 of the HS,

                               APPENDIX 3.1

             Administering Import and Export Restrictions and
                            Consultation Levels


General Provisions Applicable Only to Trade Between Mexico and
the United States and Between Mexico and Canada

1.   A Party applying a restriction or consultation level on non-
originating goods pursuant to Section 5 or paragraph 8 of this
Appendix shall apply it in accordance with this Appendix and its
Schedules.

2.   An exporting Party whose textile or apparel good is subject
to a restriction or consultation level shall limit its annual
exports to the specified limits or levels, and the importing
Party may assist the exporting Party in implementing such
restriction or consultation level by controlling its imports.

3.   Textile and apparel goods exported subject to restrictions
or consultation levels shall be counted against the limits or
levels applicable to the year in which exported.  Exports in
excess of authorized limits or levels in each calendar year
shall, if allowed entry into the importing Party, be charged to
the limit or level authorized for the succeeding year. 

4.   Each exporting Party whose goods are subject to a
restriction or consultation level shall use its best efforts to
space exports of such goods to the territory of the importing
Party evenly throughout each calendar year, taking into
consideration normal seasonal factors.

5.   Upon written request by an exporting Party whose goods are
subject to a restriction or consultation level, that Party and
the importing Party shall enter into consultations, within 30
days of receipt of the written request therefor, on any question
arising from the implementation of this Appendix.  If the
exporting Party considers that, as a result of a restriction or
consultation level applied under this Appendix, it is being
placed in an inequitable position in relation to another Party or
a non-Party, the consulting Parties shall seek a mutually
beneficial solution within 60 days of the request for
consultations.

6.   The Parties concerned may by mutual agreement adjust annual
Designated Consultation Levels (DCLs) as follows:

     (a) if an exporting Party whose goods are subject to a DCL
 wishes to export goods in any category in excess of the
 applicable DCL in any calendar year, that Party may
 present to the importing Party a formal written request
 for an increase in the DCL; and

     (b) the importing Party shall respond, in writing, within
 30 days of the receipt of the request.  If the response
 to a request is negative, consultations shall take
 place not later than 15 days after the receipt of the
 negative response or as soon as mutually convenient. 
 The Parties concerned shall endeavor to reach a
 mutually satisfactory solution.  An exchange of letters
 shall confirm any agreement reached on any new DCL.

7.  The Parties may adjust annual Specific Limits (SLs) as
follows:

     (a) an exporting Party wishing to adjust an SL in
 accordance with this paragraph shall provide notice to
 the importing Party of its intent to make such
 adjustment;

     (b) that exporting Party may increase any SL by not more
 than 6 percent (swing); and

     (c) in addition, exports from that Party may exceed by a
 maximum of 11 percent any SL by allocating to such
 limit for that calendar year an unused portion
 ("shortfall") of the corresponding limit for the
 previous calendar year ("carryover") or a portion of
 the corresponding limit for the succeeding calendar
 year ("carryforward") subject to the following
 conditions

     (i) carryover may be utilized as available up to 11
 percent of the receiving calendar year's
 applicable limits, 

          (ii) carryforward may be utilized up to 6 percent of
 the receiving calendar year's applicable limits
 and shall be charged against the  succeeding
 calendar year's corresponding limits,

          (iii) the combination of carryover and carryforward
 shall not exceed 11 percent of the receiving
 calendar year's applicable limits in any
 calendar year, and

          (iv) carryover of shortfall shall be applied to any
 specific limit following notice given by the
 exporting Party and confirmation by the importing
 Party that sufficient shortfall exists.  If the
 importing Party does not consider that sufficient
 shortfall exists, it will promptly provide data to
 support that view.  If substantial statistical
 differences exist between the import and export
 data upon which shortfall for a given period is
 computed, the Parties shall work to resolve these
 differences promptly.

Provisions Applicable Only to Trade between Mexico and the United
States

8.   During the transition period, non-originating textile and
apparel goods of Mexico exported to the United States shall be
subject to the restrictions and consultation levels specified in
Schedule 3.1.2, in accordance with this Appendix and its
Schedules.  Such restrictions and consultation levels shall be
progressively eliminated as follows:

     (a) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 1 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 1994;

     (b) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 2 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 2001; and

     (c) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained
 in the categories of textile and apparel goods in
 staging category 3 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be
 eliminated on January 1, 2004.

9.   In addition, on January 1, 1994, the United States shall
eliminate restrictions or consultation levels on textile and
apparel goods that are:

     (a) assembled in Mexico from fabrics wholly formed and cut
 in the United States; and

     (b) exported from and reimported into the United States
 under U.S. tariff item 9802.00.80.10,

and, notwithstanding Section 5, shall not adopt or maintain
prohibitions, restrictions, or consultation levels on textile and
apparel goods of Mexico that satisfy the requirements of any
successor provision to that U.S. tariff item.

10.    Notwithstanding paragraph 8, no Party may apply the
restrictions and consultation levels specified in Schedule 3.1.2
to the following textile and apparel goods, provided such goods
have been certified by the competent authority of Mexico as one
of the following:

     (a) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry;

     (b) hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-
 loomed fabrics; or

     (c) traditional folklore handicraft goods 

that have been identified and agreed between the United States
and Mexico for exemption from quantitative restrictions.

11.  The Bilateral Textile Agreement Between the United States of
America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mazatlan
February 13, 1988, as amended and extended (the Bilateral
Agreement), shall terminate upon the date of entry into force of
this Agreement.

12.  Except as otherwise provided in this Annex, the Parties
shall eliminate the restrictions and consultation levels listed
in Schedule 3.1.2 in accordance with the schedule provided in
Schedule 3.1.1.  At the request of either Party, the Parties
shall consult to consider accelerating the elimination of
restrictions or consultation levels on specific textile and
apparel goods.  An agreement between the Parties to accelerate
the elimination of a restriction or consultation level shall be
considered part of this Agreement, superseding Schedule 3.1.1.

13.  During the first calendar year following the date of entry
into force of this Agreement, Mexico may carry over any unused
portion of the preceding year's limit specified in the Bilateral
Agreement, or apply against the first year's limit specified in
this Appendix any exports made during the preceding year in
excess of the applicable limit under the Bilateral Agreement, in
accordance with the flexibility provisions set forth in paragraph
7.

14.  All exports of textiles and apparel goods from the territory
of Mexico to the territory of the United States covered by
restrictions or consultation levels under this Appendix shall be
accompanied by an export visa issued by the competent authority
of Mexico, pursuant to a bilateral visa arrangement, as amended.

15.  At the written request of either Party, both Parties shall
consult, within 30 days of receipt of the request, on any
questions arising from the implementation of this Appendix.  In
addition, at the request of either Party, those Parties shall
conduct a major review of this Section no later than five years
from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

16.  For the purpose of applying restrictions or consultation
levels, each Party shall classify a good as being:

     (a) of man-made fibers if the good is in chief weight of
 man-made fibers, unless

     (i) the good is knitted or crocheted apparel in which
 wool equals or exceeds 23 percent by weight of all
 fibers, in which case it shall be of wool,

     (ii) the good is apparel, not knitted or crocheted, in
 which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight
 of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool,
 or

     (iii) the good is a woven fabric in which wool
 equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of all
 fibers, in which case it shall be of wool;

     (b) of cotton, if not covered by (a) and if the good is in
 chief weight of cotton, unless the good is a woven
 fabric in which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by
 weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of
 wool;

     (c) of wool, if not covered by (a) or (b), and the good is
 in chief weight of wool; and

     (d) of non-cotton vegetable fiber, if not covered by (a),
 (b), or (c), and the good is in chief weight of non-
 cotton vegetable fiber, unless

     (i) cotton with wool and/or man-made fibers in the
 aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent by weight of
 the component fibers thereof and the cotton
 component equals or exceeds the weight of each of
 the total wool and/or man-made fiber components,
 in which case it shall be of cotton,

     (ii) if not covered by (d)(i) and wool exceeds 17
 percent by weight of all component fibers, in
 which case it shall be of wool, or

     (iii) if not covered by (d)(i) or (d)(ii) and man-
 made fibers in combination with cotton and/or
 wool in the aggregate equal or exceed 50
 percent by weight of the component fibers
 thereof and the man-made fiber component
 exceeds the weight of the total wool and/or
 total cotton component, in which case it

 textile goods provided for in Chapters 52 through 55,
 58, 60, and 63 of the HS that are woven or knit in a
 Party from yarn produced or obtained outside the free
 trade area, or knit in a Party from yarn spun in a
 Party from fiber produced or obtained outside the free

     (a) for textile goods that do not originate because certain
 non-originating textile materials do not undergo the
 applicable change in tariff classification described in
 Annex 401.1 for that good, but where such materials are
 50 percent or less by weight of the materials of that
 good, only 50 percent of the square meters equivalent
 for that good, determined in accordance with the
 conversion factors set out in Schedule 3.1.3 of
 Appendix 3.1; and 

     (b) for textile goods that do not originate because certain
 non-originating textile materials do not undergo the
 applicable change in tariff classification described in

1, 2, 4, and 6 shall not be considered to be originating goods.


Review and Consultations

8.   (a) Trade in the goods described in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and
 6 shall be monitored by the Parties with a view to
 adjusting annual tariff preference levels for imports
 into Canada from Mexico and the United States, imports
 into Mexico from Canada and the United States, and
 imports into the United States from Mexico at the
 request of a Party based on the ability to obtain
 supplies of particular fibers, yarns and fabrics, as
 appropriate, that can be used to produce originating
 goods.  Any adjustment in the tariff preference level
 would require the mutual consent of the affected
 Parties.

     (b) The United States and Canada will decide, in
 consultations as provided for in paragraph 3 of Section
 7, whether to continue to apply annual growth factors
 to the specified tariff preference levels following the
 five consecutive years.  If a growth factor for a
 tariff preference level is not continued as a result of
 the consultations provided for in paragraph 3 of
 Section 7, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall
 also apply to imports from Canada into the United

                               Chapter Three

              National Treatment and Market Access for Goods



                     Subchapter A - National Treatment


Article 301: National Treatment

1.   Each Party shall accord national treatment to the goods of
another Party in accordance with Article III of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), including its
interpretative notes, and to this end Article III of the GATT and
its interpretative notes, or any equivalent provision of a
successor agreement to which all Parties are party, are
incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.

2.   The provisions of paragraph 1 regarding national treatment
shall mean, with respect to a province or state, treatment no
less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded by such
province or state to any like, directly competitive or
substitutable goods, as the case may be, of the Party of which it
forms a part.

3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the measures set out
in Annex 301.3.



                          Subchapter B - Tariffs


Article 302: Tariff Elimination

1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party may
increase any existing customs duty, or adopt any customs duty, on
an originating good.

2.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party
shall progressively eliminate its customs duties on originating
goods in accordance with its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2 or
as otherwise indicated in Annex 300-B.

3.   At the request of any Party, the Parties shall consult to
consider accelerating the elimination of customs duties set out
in their Schedules.  An agreement between any two or more Parties
to accelerate the elimination of a customs duty on a good shall
supersede any prior inconsistent duty rate or staging category in
their Schedules for such good when approved by each such Party in
accordance with Article 2202(2) (Amendments).


Article 303: Restriction on Drawback and Duty Deferral Programs

1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no Party may
refund the amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce the
amount of customs duties owed, on a good imported into its
territory that is:

     (a) subsequently exported to the territory of another
 Party,

     (b) used as a material in the production of another good
 that is subsequently exported to the territory of
 another Party, or

     (c) substituted by an identical or similar good used as a
 material in the production of another good that is
 subsequently exported to the territory of another
 Party,

in an amount that exceeds the lesser of the total amount of
customs duties paid or owed on the good on importation into its
territory, or the total amount of customs duties paid to another
Party on the good that has been subsequently exported to the
territory of that other Party.

2.   No Party may, by reason of an exportation described in
paragraph 1, refund, waive or reduce:

     (a) an antidumping or countervailing duty that is applied
 pursuant to a Party's domestic law and that is not
 applied inconsistently with Chapter Nineteen (Review
 and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and
 Countervailing Duty Matters);

     (b) a premium offered or collected on an imported good
 arising out of any tendering system in respect of the
 administration of quantitative import restrictions,
 tariff rate quotas or tariff preference levels;

     (c) a fee applied pursuant to section 22 of the U.S.
 Agricultural Adjustment Act, subject to Chapter Seven
 (Agriculture); or

     (d) customs duties paid or owed on a good imported into its
 territory and substituted by an identical or similar
 good that is subsequently exported to the territory of
 another Party.

3.   Where a good is imported into the territory of a Party
pursuant to a duty deferral program and is subsequently exported
to the territory of another Party, or is used as a material in
the production of another good that is subsequently exported to
the territory of another Party, or is substituted by an identical
or similar good used as a material in the production of another
good that is subsequently exported to the territory of another
Party, the Party from whose territory the good is exported:

     (a) shall assess the customs duties as if the exported good
 had been withdrawn for domestic consumption; and

     (b) may waive or reduce such customs duties to the extent
 permitted under paragraph 1.

4.   In determining the amount of customs duties that may be
refunded, waived or reduced pursuant to paragraph 1 on a good
imported into its territory, each Party shall require
presentation of satisfactory evidence of the amount of customs
duties paid to another Party on the good that has been
subsequently exported to the territory of that other Party.

5.   Where satisfactory evidence of the customs duties paid to
the Party to which a good is subsequently exported under a duty
deferral program described in paragraph 3 is not presented within
60 days after the date of exportation, the Party from whose
territory the good was exported:

     (a) shall collect customs duties as if the exported good
 had been withdrawn for domestic consumption; and

     (b) may refund such customs duties to the extent permitted
 under paragraph 1 upon the timely presentation of such
 evidence under the laws and regulations of the Party.

6.   This Article shall not apply to:

     (a) a good entered under bond for transportation and
 exportation to the territory of another Party;

     (b) a good exported to the territory of another Party in
 the same condition as when imported into the territory
 of the Party from which the good was exported
 (processes such as testing, cleaning, repacking or
 inspecting the good, or preserving it in its same
 condition, shall not be considered to change a good's
 condition).  Where originating and non-originating
 fungible goods are commingled and exported in the same
 form, the origin of the good may be determined on the
 basis of the inventory methods provided for in the
 Uniform Regulations;

     (c) a good imported into the territory of the Party that is
 deemed to be exported from the territory of a Party, or
 used as a material in the production of another good
 that is deemed to be exported to the territory of
 another Party, or is substituted by an identical or
 similar good used as a material in the production of
 another good that is deemed to be exported to the
 territory of another Party, by reason of

     (i) delivery to a duty-free shop,

     (ii) delivery for ship's stores or supplies for ships
 or aircraft, or

     (iii) delivery for use in joint undertakings of two
 more of the Parties and that will
 subsequently become the property of the Party
 into whose territory the good was imported;

     (d) a refund of customs duties by a Party on a particular
 good imported into its territory and subsequently
 exported to the territory of another Party, where that
 refund is granted by reason of the failure of such good
 to conform to sample or specification, or by reason of
 the shipment of such good without the consent of the
 consignee;

     (e) a dutiable originating good that is imported into the
 territory of a Party and is subsequently exported to
 the territory of another Party, or used as a material
 in the production of another good that is subsequently
 exported to the territory of another Party, or is
 substituted by an identical or similar good used as a
 material in the production of another good that is
 subsequently exported to the territory of another
 Party; or

     (f) a good set out in Annex 303.6.

7.   This Article shall apply as of the date set out in each
Party's section of Annex 303.7.

8.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article and
except as specifically provided in Annex 303.8, no Party may
refund the amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce the
amount of customs duties owed, on a non-originating good provided
for under tariff provision 8540.xx (cathode-ray color television
picture tubes, including video monitor tubes, with a diagonal
exceeding 14") that is imported into the Party's territory and
subsequently exported to the territory of another Party, or is
used as a material in the production of another good that is
subsequently exported to the territory of another Party, or is
substituted by an identical or similar good used as a material in
the production of another good that is subsequently exported to
the territory of another Party.


Article 304: Waiver of Customs Duties

1.   Except as set out in Annex 304.1, no Party may adopt any new
waiver of customs duties, or expand with respect to existing
recipients or extend to any new recipient the application of an
existing waiver of customs duties, where the waiver is
conditioned, explicitly or implicitly, upon the fulfillment of a
performance requirement.

2.   Except as set out in Annex 304.2, no Party may, explicitly
or implicitly, condition on the fulfillment of a performance
requirement the continuation of any existing waiver of customs
duties.

3.   If a waiver or a combination of waivers of customs duties
granted by a Party with respect to goods for commercial use by a
designated person, and thus not generally available to all
importers, can be shown by another Party to have an adverse
impact on the commercial interests of a person of that Party, or
of a person owned or controlled by a person of that Party that is
located in the territory of the Party granting the waiver, or on
the other Party's economy, the Party granting the waiver shall
either cease to grant it or make it generally available to any
importer.

4.   This Article shall not apply to measures covered by Article
303 (Restriction on Drawback and Duty Deferral).


Article 305: Temporary Admission of Goods

1.   Each Party shall grant duty-free temporary admission for:

 broadcasting and cinematographic equipment,

     (c) goods imported for sports purposes and goods intended

substitutable goods are available in the territory of the Party.

2.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party may
condition the duty-free temporary admission of a good referred to

such good:

     (a) be imported by a national or resident of another Party
 who seeks temporary entry;

     (b) be used solely by or under the personal supervision of
 such person in the exercise of the business activity,
 trade or profession of that person;

     (c) not be sold or leased while in its territory;

     (d) be accompanied by a bond in an amount no greater than
 110 percent of the charges that would otherwise be owed
 upon entry or final importation, or by another form of
 security, releasable upon exportation of the good,
 except that a bond for customs duties shall not be
 required for an originating good;

     (e) be capable of identification when exported;

     (f) be exported upon the departure of that person or within
 such other period of time as is reasonably related to
 the purpose of the temporary admission; and

     (g) be imported in no greater quantity than is reasonable
 for its intended use.

3.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party may
condition the duty-free temporary admission of a good referred to

     (a) be imported solely for the solicitation of orders for
 goods, or services provided from the territory, of
 another Party or non-Party;

     (b) not be sold, leased, or put to any use other than
 exhibition or demonstration while in its territory;

     (c) be capable of identification when exported;

     (d) be exported within such period as is reasonably related
 to the purpose of the temporary admission; and

     (e) be imported in no greater quantity than is reasonable
 for its intended use.

4.   A Party may impose the customs duty and any other charge on
a good temporarily admitted duty-free under paragraph 1 that
would be owed upon entry or final importation of such good if any
condition that the Party imposes under paragraph 2 or 3 has not
been fulfilled.

5.   Subject to Chapters Eleven (Investment) and Twelve (Cross-
Border Trade in Services):

     (a) each Party shall allow a locomotive, truck, truck
 tractor, or tractor trailer unit,  railway car, other
 railroad equipment, trailer ("vehicle") or container,
 used in international traffic, that enters its
 territory from the territory of another Party to exit
 its territory on any route that is reasonably related
 to the economic and prompt departure of such vehicle or
 container;

     (b) no Party may require any bond or impose any penalty or
 charge solely by reason of any difference between the
 port of entry and the port of departure of a vehicle or
 container;

     (c) no Party may condition the release of any obligation,
 including any bond, that it imposes in respect of the
 entry of a vehicle or container into its territory on
 its exit through any particular port of departure; and

     (d) no Party may require that the vehicle or carrier
 bringing a container from the territory of another
 Party into its territory be the same vehicle or carrier
 that takes such container to the territory of another
 Party.


Article 306: Duty-Free Entry of Certain Commercial Samples and
 Printed Advertising Materials

     Each Party shall grant duty-free entry to commercial samples
of negligible value, and to printed advertising materials,
imported from the territory of another Party, regardless of their
origin, but may require that:

     (a) such samples be imported solely for the solicitation of
 orders for goods of, or services provided from, the
 territory of another Party or non-Party; or

     (b) such advertising materials be imported in packets that
 each contain no more than one copy of each such
 material and that neither such materials nor packets
 form part of a larger consignment.


Article 307: Goods Re-entered after Repair or Alteration

territory to the territory of another Party for repair or
alteration, regardless of whether such repair or alteration could
be performed in its territory.

apply a customs duty to a good, regardless of its origin,
imported temporarily from the territory of another Party for
repair or alteration.

including its interpretative notes, and to this end Article XI of
the GATT and its interpretative notes, or any equivalent

party, are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.

2.   The Parties understand that the GATT rights and obligations
incorporated by paragraph 1 prohibit, in any circumstances in
which any other form of restriction is prohibited, export price
requirements and, except as permitted in enforcement of
countervailing and antidumping orders and undertakings, import
price requirements.

3.   In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a prohibition
or restriction on the importation from or exportation to a non-
Party of a good, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
prevent the Party from:

     (a) limiting or prohibiting the importation from the
 territory of another Party of such good of that non-
 Party; or

     (b) requiring as a condition of export of such good of the
 Party to the territory of another Party, that the good
 not be re-exported to that non-Party, directly or
 indirectly, without having been increased in value and
 improved in condition [subject to review].

4.   In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a prohibition
or restriction on the importation of a good from a non-Party, the

whether the good is marked.

category set out for an item in column I of section B of this
Annex to an originating good when the good qualifies to be marked
as a good of the United States, pursuant to Annex 312, without
regard to whether the good is marked.

10.  The United States shall apply the rate applicable under the
staging category set out for an item in Annex 401.2, as amended,

                         Country of Origin Marking


1.   The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994, rules for
determining whether a good is a good of a Party ("Marking Rules")
for the purposes of this Annex, Annex 300-B and Annex 302.2, and
for such other purposes as may be agreed.

2.   Each Party may require that a good of another Party, as
determined in accordance with the Marking Rules, imported into
its territory bear a country of origin marking that indicates to
the ultimate purchaser of that good the name of its country of
origin.

3.   Each Party shall permit the country of origin marking of a
good of another Party to be indicated in English, French or
Spanish, except that a Party may, as part of its general consumer
information measures, require that an imported good be marked
with its country of origin in the same manner as prescribed for
goods of that Party.

4.   Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining and administering
any measure relating to country of origin marking, minimize the
difficulties, costs and inconveniences that such measure may
cause to the commerce and industry of the other Parties.

5.   Each Party shall:

     (a) accept any reasonable method of marking, including the
 use of stickers, labels, tags or paint, that ensures
 that the marking is conspicuous, legible and
 sufficiently permanent;

     (b) exempt from a country of origin marking requirement a
 good of another Party which

     (i) is incapable of being marked,

     (ii) cannot be marked prior to exportation to the
 territory of another Party without causing injury
 to the goods,

     (iii) cannot be marked except at an expense which
 would materially discourage its exportation
 to the territory of another Party,

     (iv) cannot be marked without materially impairing its
 function or substantially detracting from its
 appearance,

     (v) is in a container that is marked in a manner that
 will reasonably indicate the good's origin to the
 ultimate purchaser,

     (vi) is a crude substance,

     (vii) is imported for use by the importer and is
 not intended for sale in the form in which it
 was imported,

     (viii) is to be processed in the importing Party by
 the importer, or on its behalf, in a manner
 that results in a change of origin for
 marking purposes, under the Marking Rules,

     (ix) by reason of its character, or the circumstances
 of its importation, the ultimate purchaser would
 reasonably know its country of origin even though
 it is not marked,

     (x) was produced more than 20 years prior to its
 importation,

     (xi) was imported without the required marking and
 cannot be marked after its importation except at
 an expense that would materially discourage its
 importation, provided that the failure to mark the
 good before importation was not for the purpose of
 avoiding compliance with such requirement,

     (xii) for the purposes of temporary duty-free
 admission, is in transit or in bond or
 otherwise under customs administration
 control,

     (xiii) is an original work of art, or

     (xiv) is provided for in headings 8541 or 8542, and
 6904.10.

6.   Except for a good described in subparagraphs 5(b)(vi),(vii),
(viii), (ix), (x), (xii), (xiii) and (xiv), a Party may provide
that, wherever a good is exempted under subparagraph 5(b), its
outermost container that ordinarily reaches the ultimate
purchaser shall be marked so as to indicate the country of origin
of the good it contains.

7.   Each Party shall provide that:

     (a) a usual container imported empty, whether or not
 disposable, shall not be required to be marked with its
 own country of origin, but the container in which it is
 imported may be required to be marked with the country
 of origin of its contents; and

     (b) a usual container imported filled, whether or not
 disposable,

     (i) shall not be required to be marked with its own
 country of origin, but

     (ii) may be required to be marked with the country of
 origin of its contents, unless the contents are
 marked with their country of origin and the
 container can be readily opened for inspection of
 the contents, or the marking of the contents is
 clearly visible through the container.

8.   Each Party shall, whenever administratively practicable,
permit an importer to mark a good subsequent to importation but
prior to release of the good from customs control or custody,
unless there have been repeated violations of the country of
origin marking requirements of that Party by the same importer
and that importer has been previously notified in writing that
such good is required to be marked prior to importation.

9.   Each Party shall provide that, except with respect to
importers that have been notified under paragraph 8, no special
duty or penalty shall be imposed for failure to comply with
country of origin marking requirements, unless a good is removed
from customs custody or control without being properly marked, or
a deceptive marking has been used.

10.  The Parties shall cooperate and consult on matters related
to this Annex, including additional exemptions from a country of
origin marking requirement, in accordance with Chapter Five
(Customs Procedures).

11.  For purposes of this Annex:

conspicuous means capable of being easily seen with normal
handling of the good or container;

legible means capable of being easily read;

materially discourage means add a cost to the good that is
substantial in relation to its customs value;

sufficiently permanent means capable of remaining in place until
the good reaches the ultimate purchaser, unless deliberately
removed;

the form in which it was imported means the condition of the good
before it has undergone one of the changes in tariff
classification described in the Marking Rules;

ultimate purchaser means the last person in the territory of the
Party into which the good is imported that purchases the good in
the form in which it was imported; such purchaser need not be the
last person that will use the good; and

usual container means the container in which a good will
ordinarily reach its ultimate purchaser.

                               Export Taxes


Mexico

1.   Mexico may adopt or maintain a duty, tax, or other charge on
the export of those basic foodstuffs set out in paragraph 4, on
their ingredients, or on the goods from which such foodstuffs are
derived, if such duty, tax, or other charge is adopted or
maintained on the export of such goods to the territory of all
other Parties, and is used:

     (a) to limit to domestic consumers the benefits of a
 domestic food assistance program with respect to such
 foodstuff; or

     (b) to ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of
 such foodstuff to domestic consumers or of sufficient
 quantities of its ingredients, or of the goods from
 which such foodstuffs are derived, to a domestic
 processing industry, when the domestic price of such
 foodstuff is held below the world price as part of a
 governmental stabilization plan, provided that such
 duty, tax, or other charge

     (i) does not operate to increase the protection
 afforded to such domestic industry, and

     (ii) is maintained only for such period of time as is
 necessary to maintain the integrity of the
 stabilization plan.

2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Mexico may adopt or maintain a
duty, tax, or other charge on the export of any foodstuff to the
territory of another Party if such duty, tax, or other charge is
temporarily applied to relieve critical shortages of that
foodstuff.  For purposes of this paragraph, "temporarily" means
up to one year, or such longer period as the Parties may agree.

3.   Mexico may maintain its existing tax on the export of goods

                              Rules of Origin



Article 401: Originating Goods

     Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, a good shall
originate in the territory of a Party provided that:

     (a) the good is wholly obtained or produced in the
 territory of one or more of the Parties as defined in
 Article 415;

     (b) each of the non-originating materials used in the
 production of the good undergoes an applicable change
 in tariff classification described in Annex 401.1 as a
 result of production occurring entirely in the
 territory of one or more of the Parties, and the good
 satisfies all other applicable requirements of this
 Chapter;

     (c) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one
 or more of the Parties exclusively from originating
 materials; or

     (d) with the exception of a good provided for in Chapters
 61 through 63 of the Harmonized System, the good is
 produced entirely in the territory of one or more of
 the Parties but one or more of the non-originating
 parts used in the production of the good does not
 undergo a change in tariff classification because

     (i) the good was imported into the territory of a
 Party in an unassembled or a disassembled form but
 was classified as an assembled good pursuant to
 General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the
 Harmonized System, or 

     (ii) the tariff heading for the good provides for both
 the good itself and its parts and is not further
 subdivided into subheadings, or the tariff
 subheading for the good provides for both the good
 itself and its parts,

     provided that the good is the good specifically
described by the nomenclature of the heading or
subheading and that the regional value content of the
good, determined in accordance with Article 402, is not
less than 60 percent where the transaction value method
is used, or 50 percent where the net cost method is
used, and that the good satisfies all other applicable
requirements of this Chapter.


Article 402: Regional Value Content

1.   Except as provided in paragraph 5, each Party shall provide
that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at
the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis
of either the transaction value method described in paragraph 2
or the net cost method described in paragraph 3.

2.   The regional value content of a good, where calculated on
the basis of the transaction value method, shall be determined as
follows:

     TV - VNM
     RVC  = --------- x 100
        TV

     where:

     RVC  is the regional value content, expressed as a
 percentage;

     TV  is the transaction value of the good;
 and

     VNM  is the value of non-originating materials
 used by the producer in the production of the
 good. 

3.   The regional value content of a good, where calculated on
the basis of the net cost method, shall be determined as follows: 


     NC - VNM
     RVC  = --------- x 100  
        NC

     where:

     RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a
 percentage;

     NC is the net cost of the good; and

     VNM is the value of non-originating materials
 used by the producer in the production of the
 good.

4.   For purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, and except as provided
in Articles 403(1) and 403(2)(a)(i), the value of non-originating
materials used by the producer in the production of the good
shall not include the value of non-originating materials used to
produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the
production of the good.

5.   The regional value content of a good shall be calculated
solely on the basis of the net cost method described in paragraph
3, where: 

     (a) there is no transaction value for the good; 

     (b) the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under
 Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code;

     (c) the good is sold by the producer to a related person
 and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales of
 identical or similar goods to related persons, during
 the six-month period immediately preceding the month in
 which the good is sold, exceeds 85 percent of the
 producer's total sales with respect to such goods;

     (d) the good is

     (i) identified in Article 403(1) or 403(2),

     (ii) provided for in headings 64.01 through 64.05, or 

     (iii) provided for in tariff item 8469.10.a1 (word
 processing machines); 

     (e) the exporter or producer chooses to accumulate the
 regional value content of the good in accordance with
 Article 404; or

     (f) the good has been designated as an intermediate
 material under paragraph 10 and is subject to a
 regional value-content requirement. 

6.   If an exporter or producer calculates the regional value
content of a good using the transaction value method described in
paragraph 2 and a Party subsequently notifies the exporter or
producer during the course of a verification pursuant to Chapter
Five (Customs Procedures) that the transaction value of the good,
or the value of any material used in the production of the good,
or both, is required to be adjusted or is unacceptable under
Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the exporter or producer
of the good may then calculate the regional value content of the
good using the net cost method described in paragraph 3.

7.   Nothing in paragraph 6 shall be construed to preclude a
review and appeal, pursuant to Chapter Five (Customs Procedures),
of an adjustment or rejection of a transaction value for a good
or the value of any material used in the production of the good,
or both. 

8.   For purposes of calculating the net cost of a good pursuant
to paragraph 3, the producer of the good may use any one of the
following methods:

     (a) calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all
 goods produced by that producer minus any sales
 promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs,
 royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-
 allowable interest costs that are included in the total
 cost of all goods and then reasonably allocate the
 resulting net cost of those goods to the good; 

     (b) reasonably allocate the total cost incurred with
 respect to all goods produced by that producer to the
 good minus any sales promotion, marketing and after-
 sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing
 costs and non-allowable interest costs that are
 included in the portion of the total cost allocated to
 the good; or

     (c) reasonably allocate the individual costs that are part
 of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so
 that the aggregate of these costs does not include any
 sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service
 costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-
 allowable interest costs, 

provided that the allocation of all such costs are consistent
with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of costs
set out in the Uniform Regulations.

9.   With the exception of an intermediate material described in
paragraph 10 and except as provided in Article 403(1) and
(2)(a)(i), the value of a material used in the production of a
good shall be:

     (a) the price actually paid or payable by the producer for
 the material, provided that the price is acceptable
 under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code; or

     (b) if the price actually paid or payable is unacceptable
 under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the
 value shall be determined in accordance with the other
 Articles of the Customs Valuation Code; and

     (c) when not included under subparagraph (a) or (b) 

     (i) freight, insurance, packing and all other costs
 incurred in transporting such materials to the
 location of the producer,

     (ii) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on such
 materials paid in the territory of one or more of
 the Parties,

     (iii) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from
 the use or consumption, or both, of such
 materials, less the value of renewable scrap
 or by-product, and

     (iv) the value of goods and services relating to such
 materials determined in accordance with
 subparagraph 1(b) of Article 8 of the Customs
 Valuation Code.

10.  Except as provided in Article 403, the producer of a good
may designate any self-produced material used in the production
of the good as an intermediate material, provided that, when the
intermediate material is subject to a regional value-content
requirement, no other intermediate material subject to a regional
value-content requirement is used in the production of that
intermediate material.

11.  For purposes of determining the value of an intermediate
material, the producer of the intermediate material may use
either of the following methods:

     (a) calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all
 goods produced by that producer and then reasonably
 allocate the resulting cost to the intermediate
 material; or

     (b) reasonably allocate to the intermediate material the
 individual costs that are part of the total cost
 incurred with respect to that intermediate material.


Article 403: Automotive Goods

1.   Where applying the net cost method under Article 402(3) for
purposes of calculating the regional value content of any one of
the following goods:

 non-originating materials used by the producer in the
 production of the good the sum of

     (i) for each material used by the producer that is
 listed in Annex 403.2, at the choice of the
 producer, either

     (A)  the value of such material that is non-
 originating, or

     (B)  the value of non-originating materials
 used in the production of such material,
 and

     (ii) the value of any non-originating material used by

the production of any material listed in Annex 403.2 as an
intermediate material, provided that, when the intermediate
material is subject to a regional value-content requirement, no
other intermediate material subject to a regional value-content
requirement is used in the production of that intermediate
material. 

4.   In calculating the regional value content of a motor vehicle
described in paragraphs 1 and 2, the producer may average its
calculation over its fiscal year, using any one of the following
categories, on the basis of either all motor vehicles in the
category or only those motor vehicles in the category that are
exported to the territory of one or more of the other Parties: 

     (a) the same model line of motor vehicles in the same class
 of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory
 of a Party; 

     (b) the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same
 plant in the territory of a Party; 

     (c) the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the
 territory of a Party; or

     (d) the basis described in Annex 403.4.

5.   In calculating the regional value content for any or all

 to whom the good is sold, or over any quarter or
 month, or

     (ii) over its fiscal year, if the good is sold as an
 after-market part;

     (b) calculate the average referred to in subparagraph (a)
 separately for any or all goods sold to one or more
 motor vehicle producers; and 

     (c) with respect to any calculation under this paragraph,

Article 404: Accumulation

     For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating
good, the production of the good in the territory of one or more
of the Parties by one or more producers shall, at the choice of
the exporter or producer of the good, be considered to have been
performed in the territory of a Party by that exporter or
producer, provided that:

     (a) the applicable tariff classification change has
 occurred, or the regional value-content requirement has
 been satisfied, or both, entirely in the territory of
 one or more of the Parties; 

     (b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of
 this Chapter; and

     (c) the production of the producer that chooses to
 accumulate its production with that of other producers
 is deemed to be the production of a single producer for
 purposes of Article 402(10).


Article 405: De Minimis

1.   Notwithstanding Article 401(b), a good shall be considered
to be an originating good if the value of all non-originating
materials used in the production of the good that do not undergo
the applicable change in tariff classification is not more than
seven percent of the transaction value of the good or, if the
transaction value of the good is unacceptable under Article 1 of
the Customs Valuation Code, seven percent of the total cost of
the good, provided that:

     (a) if the good is subject to a regional value-content
 requirement, the value of such non-originating
 materials shall be taken into account in calculating
 the regional value content of the good; and

     (b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of
 this Chapter.

2.   A good that is subject to a regional value-content
requirement shall not be required to satisfy such requirement if
the value of all non-originating materials used in the production
of the good is not more than seven percent of the transaction
value of the good or, if the transaction value of the good is
unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the
value of all non-originating materials is not more than seven
percent of the total cost of the good, provided that the good
satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 

3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to: 

     (a) a material provided for in Chapter 4 of the Harmonized
 System or tariff item 1901.90.a1 (dairy preparations

 1901.10.a1 (infant preparations containing over 10
 percent by weight of milk solids), 1901.20.a1 (mixes
 and doughs, containing over 25 percent by weight of
 butterfat, not put up for retail sale), 1901.90.a1
 (dairy preparations containing over 10 percent by
 weight of milk solids), 2106.90.a4 (preparations
 containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids) or
 2309.90.a1 (animal feeds containing over 10 percent by
 weight of milk solids and less than 6 percent by weight
 of grain or grain products); 

     (c) a material provided for in heading 17.01 that is used
 in the production of a good provided for in headings
 17.01 through 17.03;

     (d) a material provided for in Chapter 15 of the Harmonized
 System that is used in the production of a good
 provided for in headings 15.01 through 15.08, 15.12,
 15.14 or 15.15;

     (e) a material provided for in heading 08.05 and

 that is used in the production of a good provided for
 in headings 22.07 through 22.08.

4.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply for purposes of calculating the
volume or weight of:

     (a) a non-originating material of Chapter 17 of the
 Harmonized System or heading 18.05 that are used in the
 production of a good provided for in subheading
 1806.10;

 minerals or vitamins) 2202.90.a2 (mixtures of fruit or
 vegetable juices, fortified with minerals or vitamins).

5.   A good of Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System
that does not originate because certain fibers or yarns used in
the production of the component of the good that gives the good
its essential character do not undergo the applicable change in
tariff classification described in Annex 401.1 for the good,
shall nonetheless be considered to originate if the weight of all
such fibers or yarns in the good is not more than seven percent
of the weight of that component.

6.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to a good of Chapters 1
through 44 of the Harmonized System unless the non-originating
material is provided for in a different subheading than the good
for which origin is being determined under this Article.


Article 406: Fungible Goods and Materials

     For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating
good: 

     (a) where originating and non-originating fungible
 materials are used in the production of a good, the
 origin of the materials need not be determined through
 the identification of any specific fungible material,
 but may be determined on the basis of any of the
 inventory management methods provided for in the
 Uniform Regulations; and

     (b) where originating and non-originating fungible goods
 are commingled and exported in the same form, the
 origin of the good may be determined on the basis of
 any of the inventory management methods provided for in
 the Uniform Regulations.


Article 407: Accessories, Spare Parts, or Tools

     For purposes of determining whether a good, is an
originating good, accessories, spare parts or tools delivered
with the good that form part of the good's standard accessories,
spare parts, or tools, shall be considered as one with the good
and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-
originating materials used in the production of the good undergo
the applicable change in tariff classification described in Annex
401.1, provided that:

     (a) the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced
 separately from the good;

     (b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare
 parts or tools are customary for the good; and
 
     (c) if the good is subject to a regional value-content
 requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts
 or tools shall be taken into account as either
 originating or non-originating materials in calculating
 the regional value content of the good.


Article 408: Indirect Materials

     An indirect material shall be considered to be an
originating material without regard to where it is produced.  


Article 409: Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale

     Packaging materials and containers in which a good is
packaged for retail sale shall, if classified as one with the
good, be disregarded in determining whether all the non-
originating materials used in the production of the good undergo
the applicable change in tariff classification described in Annex
401.1, and, if the good is subject to a regional value content
requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers
shall be taken into account in calculating the regional value
content of the good.


Article 410: Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment

     For the purpose of determining whether a good is an
originating good, packing materials and containers in which the
good is packed for shipment shall be disregarded in determining
whether: 

     (a) the non-originating materials used in the production of
 the good undergo the applicable change in tariff
 classification described in Annex 401.1; and

     (b) the good satisfies a regional value-content
 requirement.


Article 411: Transshipment

     A good shall not be considered to be an originating good by
virtue of having undergone production that satisfies the
requirements of Article 401 if, subsequent to that production,
the good undergoes further production, or any other operation,
outside the territories of the Parties, other than unloading,
reloading, or any other operation necessary to preserve it in
good condition or to transport the good to the territory of a
Party.


Article 412: Non-Qualifying Operations

     A good shall not be considered to be an originating good
merely by virtue of having undergone:

     (a) mere dilution with water or another substance that does
 not materially alter the characteristics of the good;
 or

     (b) any process, work or pricing practice, or any
 combination thereof, in respect of which it is
 demonstrated, on the basis of a preponderance of 
 evidence, that the object was to circumvent the
 provisions of this Chapter. 


Article 413: Interpretation

     For purposes of this Chapter, the following rules of
interpretation shall apply:

     (a) the basis for tariff classification in Article 401 is
 the Harmonized System;

     (b) a more specific rule in Annex 401.1 shall take
 precedence over a general requirement under Article
 401; 

     (c) for purposes of applying Article 401(d), when
 determining whether a tariff heading or subheading
 provides for both a good and its parts, reference shall
 be made both to the nomenclature of the heading or
 subheading and to any legal note provided in the
 Harmonized System;

     (d) the principles of the Customs Valuation Code shall
 apply to domestic transactions as well as international
 transactions;

     (e) in the event of any inconsistency between the
 provisions of this Chapter and the Customs Valuation
 Code, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail to
 the extent of the inconsistency;

     (f) in applying Customs Valuation Code under this Chapter,
 the definitions in Article 415 shall take precedence
 over the definitions of the Customs Valuation Code to
 the extent of any difference; and

     (g) all costs referred to in this Chapter shall be recorded
 and maintained in accordance with the Generally
 Accepted Accounting Principles in the territory of the
 Party in which the good is produced.


Article 414: Consultation and Revision

1.   The Parties shall consult regularly to ensure that the
provisions of this Chapter are administered effectively,
uniformly and consistently with the spirit and intent of this
Agreement, and shall cooperate in the administration of the
provisions of this Chapter in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter Five (Customs Procedures).

2.   If any Party concludes that the provisions of this Chapter
require revision to take into account developments in production
processes or other matters, the proposed revision along with
supporting rationale and any studies shall be submitted to the
other Parties for consideration and any appropriate action
pursuant to Chapter Five (Customs Procedures).

                                ANNEX 403.4

                Regional Value-Content Calculation for CAMI


1.   For purposes of Article 403, when determining the origin of
motor vehicles produced in the territory of Canada and imported
into the territory of the United States, CAMI Automotive, Inc.
("CAMI") may average its calculation of the regional value
content of a class of motor vehicles or a model line of motor
vehicles produced in a fiscal year in the territory of Canada by
CAMI for sale in the territory of one or more of the Parties with
the calculation of the regional value content of the
corresponding class of motor vehicles or model line of motor
vehicles produced in the territory of Canada by General Motors of
Canada Limited in a fiscal year that corresponds most closely to
CAMI's fiscal year, provided that: 

     (a) General Motors of Canada Limited owns 50 percent or
 more of the voting common stock of CAMI; and  

     (b) General Motors of Canada Limited, General Motors
 Corporation, General Motors de Mexico S.A., and any
 subsidiary directly or indirectly owned by any of them,
 or by any combination thereof, ("GM") acquires 75
 percent (75 percent) or more by unit of the class of
 motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the
 case may be, that CAMI Automotive Inc. has produced in
 the territory of Canada in CAMI's fiscal year for sale
 in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

2.   If GM acquires less than 75 percent by unit  of the class of
motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the case may
be, that CAMI has produced in the territory of Canada in CAMI's
fiscal year for sale in the territory of one or more of the
Parties, CAMI may average in the manner described in paragraph 1
only those motor vehicles that are acquired by GM for
distribution under the GEO marque or other GM marque.   

3.   In calculating the regional value content of motor vehicles
produced by CAMI in the territory of Canada, CAMI may choose to
average the calculation in paragraph 1 or 2 over a period of two
fiscal years in the event that any motor vehicle assembly plant
operated by CAMI or any motor vehicle assembly plant operated by
General Motors of Canada Limited with which CAMI is averaging its
regional value content is closed for more than two consecutive
months:

     (a) for the purpose of re-tooling for a model change, or

     (b) as the result of any event or circumstance (other than
 the imposition of antidumping and countervailing
 duties, or an interruption of operations resulting from
 a labour strike, lock-out, labour dispute, picketing or
 boycott of or by employees of CAMI or GM), that CAMI or
 GM could not reasonably have been expected to avert by
 corrective action or by exercise of due care and
 diligence, including a shortage of materials, failure
 of utilities, or inability to obtain or delay in
 obtaining raw materials, parts, fuel or utilities.
  
Such averaging may be for CAMI's fiscal year in which a CAMI or
the General Motors of Canada Limited plant with which CAMI is
averaging is closed and either the previous or subsequent fiscal
year.  In the event that the period of closure spans two fiscal
year, the averaging may be only for those two fiscal years.

4.   For the purposes of this Article, where by virtue of an
amalgamation, reorganization, division or similar transaction:

     (a) a motor vehicle producer (the "successor producer")
 acquires all or substantially all of the assets used by
 GM; and

     (b) the successor producer, directly or indirectly
 controls, or is controlled by, GM, or both the
 successor producer and GM are controlled by the same
 person,

the successor producer shall be deemed to be the same person and
a continuation of GM from which it acquired the assets.

Article 501: Certificate of Origin

1.   Upon the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the
Parties shall establish a Certificate of Origin for the purpose
of certifying that a good being exported from the territory of a
Party into the territory of another Party qualifies as an
originating good, and may thereafter revise the Certificate by
agreement.  

2.   Each Party may provide that a Certificate of Origin for a
good imported into its territory be completed in a language
required under its laws or regulations.

3.   Each Party shall provide that:

     (a) an exporter in its territory shall complete and sign a
 Certificate of Origin for any exportation of a good for
 which an importer may claim preferential tariff
 treatment upon importation of the good into the
 territory of another Party; and

     (b) where an exporter in its territory is not the producer
 of the good, such exporter may complete and sign a
 Certificate on the basis of

     (i) its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an
 originating good, 

     (ii) reasonable reliance upon the producer's written
 representation that the good qualifies as an
 originating good, or

     (iii) a completed and signed Certificate for the
 good voluntarily provided to the exporter by
 the producer. 

4.   Nothing in paragraph 3 shall be construed to require a
producer to provide a Certificate of Origin to an exporter.

5.   Each Party shall:

     (a) provide that a Certificate of Origin that has been
 completed and signed by an exporter or a producer in
 the territory of another Party that is applicable to

     (i) a single importation of a good into its territory,
 or

     (ii) multiple importations of identical goods imported
 into its territory within any specified period,
 not exceeding 12 months, set out therein by the
 exporter or producer,

     shall be accepted by its customs administration for a
period of four years after the date on which the
Certificate was signed; and 

     (b) require an exporter or a producer in its territory that
 completes and signs a Certificate pursuant to
 subparagraph (a) to notify in writing all persons to
 whom such Certificate was given of any change that
 could affect its accuracy or validity.

with respect to an importer in its territory that claims
preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its

 a valid Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies
 as an originating good;

     (b) the importer shall have the Certificate in its
 possession at the time such declaration is made;

     (c) the importer shall provide, upon the request of that
 Party's customs administration, a copy of the
 Certificate;

 set out in this Chapter, that Party may deny
 preferential tariff treatment to the good;

     (e) the importer, where the importer has reason to believe
 that a Certificate on which a declaration was based
 contains information that is not correct, shall
 promptly make a corrected declaration and pay any
 duties owing; and

     (f) the importer, who voluntarily makes a corrected
 declaration pursuant to subparagraph (e), shall not be
 subject to penalties for the making of an incorrect
 declaration.

2.   Each Party shall provide that, where a good would have
qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the
territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff
treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may,
within one year of the date on which the good was imported, apply
for a refund of any excess duties paid as the result of the good
not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment, upon
presentation of:

     (a) a written declaration that the good qualifies as an
 originating good at the time of importation; 

     (b) a copy of the Certificate of Origin to the same effect;
 and

 it may establish, except that it may require that the
 invoice accompanying such importation include a
 statement certifying that such goods qualify as
 originating goods;

 not exceed the amount of (US)$1000 or its equivalent
 amount in the Party's currency, or such higher amount
 as it may establish; or

 territory the good is imported has waived the
 requirement for a Certificate of Origin,

     provided that such importation does not form part of a
     series of importations that may reasonably be considered to
     have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding
     the certification requirements set out in Articles 501 and
     502.


Article 504: Obligations Regarding Exportations 

     Each Party shall provide that:

     (a) upon the request of its customs administration, an
 exporter in its territory, or a producer in its
 territory that has provided a copy of a Certificate of
 Origin to such exporter pursuant to Article
 501(3)(b)(iii), shall provide a copy of the Certificate
 to its customs administration;

     (b) a false certification by an exporter or a producer in
 its territory that a good to be exported to the
 territory of another Party qualifies as an originating
 good shall have the same legal consequences, with
 appropriate modifications, as would apply to an
 importer in its territory with respect to a
 contravention of its customs laws and regulations
 regarding the making of a false statement or
 representation;

     (c) where an exporter or a producer in its territory fails
 to comply with any of the requirements set out in this
 Chapter, it may apply such measures as the
 circumstances may warrant;

 in writing all persons to whom the Certificate was
 given of any change that could affect the accuracy or
 validity of the Certificate; and

 maintain in its territory, for a period of five years
 from the date the Certificate was signed or for such
 longer period as such Party may specify, all records
 relating to the origin of a good for which preferential
 tariff treatment was claimed in the territory of
 another Party, including records associated with

     (i) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment
 for, the good that is exported from its territory,
 and

     (ii) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment
 for, all materials, including indirect materials,
 used in the production of the good that is
 exported from its territory, and

     (iii) the production of the good in the form in
 which the good is exported from its
 territory; and

     (b) an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for
 a good imported into the Party's territory shall
 maintain in that territory, for a period of five years
 from the date of importation of the good or for such
 longer period as the Party may specify, a copy of the
 Certificate and all other required documentation
 relating to the importation of the good. 


Article 506: Origin Verifications

1.   For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its
territory from the territory of another Party qualifies as an
originating good, a Party may, through its customs
administration, conduct a verification solely by means of:

     (a) written questionnaires to an exporter or a producer in
 the territory of another Party; 

     (b) visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer in
 the territory of another Party to review the records
 and observe the facilities used in the production of
 the good; or

     (c) such other procedure as the Parties may agree.

2.   Prior to conducting a verification visit pursuant to
paragraph (1)(b), a Party shall, through its customs
administration:

     (a) deliver a written notification of its intention to
 conduct such visit;

     (i) to the exporter or producer whose premises are to
 be visited,

     (ii) to the customs administration of the Party in
 whose territory the visit is to occur, and

     (iii) to, if requested by the Party in whose
 territory the visit is to occur, the embassy
 of such Party in the territory of the Party
 proposing to conduct the visit; and

     (b) obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer
 whose premises are to be visited.

3.   The notification referred to in paragraph 2 shall include:

     (a) the identity of the customs administration issuing the
 notification;

     (b) the name of the exporter or producer whose premises are
 to be visited;

     (c) the date and place of the proposed verification visit;

     (d) the object and scope of the proposed verification
 visit, including specific reference to the good subject
 to the verification;

     (e) the names and titles of the officials performing the
 verification visit; and

     (f) the legal authority for the verification visit. 
 
4.   Where an exporter or a producer has not given its written
consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 days of
receipt of notification pursuant to paragraph 2, the notifying
Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that
would have been the subject of the visit.

5.   Each Party shall provide that, where its customs
administration receives notification pursuant to paragraph 2, it
may, within 15 days from the date of receipt of such
notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a
period not exceeding 60 days from the date of such receipt, or
for such longer period as the Parties may otherwise agree.

6.   A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a
good based solely on the postponement of a verification visit
pursuant to paragraph 5.

7.   Each Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good
is the subject of a verification visit by another Party to
designate two observers to be present during such visit, provided
that:

     (a) the observers do not participate in a manner other than
 as observers; and

     (b) the failure of such exporter or producer to designate
 observers shall not result in the postponement of the
 visit.

8.   Each Party shall, through its customs administration,
conduct a verification of a regional value-content requirement in
accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
applied in the territory of the Party from which the good was
exported.

9.   The Party conducting a verification shall provide the
exporter or producer whose good is subject to the verification
with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an
originating good, including findings of fact and the legal basis
for the determination.

10.  Where verifications by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct
by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported
representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies
as an originating good, such Party may withhold preferential
tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by such
person until that person establishes compliance with the
provisions of Chapter Four (Rules of Origin).

11.  Each Party shall provide that where it determines that a
certain good imported into its territory does not qualify as an
originating good based on a tariff classification or a customs
value applied by the Party to one or more materials used in the
production of the good, which differs from the tariff
classification or customs value applied to such materials by the
Party from whose territory the good was exported, the Party's
determination shall not become effective until it notifies in
writing both the importer of the good and the person that
completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the good of
its determination. 

12.  A Party shall not apply a determination made under paragraph
11 to an importation made before the effective date of the
determination, provided that:

     (a) the customs administration of the Party from whose
 territory the good was exported has issued an advance
 ruling on the tariff classification or on the customs
 value of such materials, or has given consistent
 treatment to the entry of such materials under the
 tariff classification or customs value at issue, on
 which a person is entitled to rely; and

     (b) the advance ruling or consistent treatment was given
 prior to notification of the determination.

13.  Where a Party denies preferential tariff treatment to a good
pursuant to a determination made under paragraph 11, it shall
postpone the effective date of the denial for a period not
exceeding 90 days, provided that the importer of the good, or the
person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the
good, demonstrates that it has relied in good faith to its
detriment on the tariff classification or customs value applied
to such materials by the customs administration of the Party from
whose territory the good was exported.


Article 507: Confidentiality

1.   Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its laws and
regulations, the confidentiality of confidential business
information collected pursuant to this Chapter and shall protect
that business information from disclosure that could prejudice
the competitive position of the persons providing the
information.  

2.   The confidential business information collected pursuant to
this Chapter may only be disclosed to those authorities
responsible for the administration and enforcement of
determinations of origin, and of customs and revenue matters.

or administrative penalties for violations of its laws and
regulations relating to this Chapter.

shall be construed to prevent a Party from applying such measures
as the circumstances may warrant.

Articles 509: Advance Rulings

1.   Each Party shall, through its customs administration,
provide for the expeditious issuance of written advance rulings,
prior to the importation of a good into its territory, to an
importer in its territory or an exporter or a producer in the
territory of another Party, on the basis of the facts and
circumstances presented by such importer, exporter or producer of
the good, concerning:

     (a) whether materials imported from the territory of a non-
 Party undergo, as a result of production in the
 territory of one or more of the Parties, the applicable
 change in tariff classification under Chapter Four
 (Rules of Origin) to qualify as an originating good;  

     (b) whether a good satisfies a regional value-content
 requirement under either the transaction value method
 or the net cost method set out in Chapter Four;

     (c) the appropriate basis or method for customs value to be
 applied by an exporter or a producer in the territory
 of another Party, in accordance with the principles of
 the Customs Valuation Code, in calculating the
 transaction value of a good, or the value of materials
 used in the production of a good, for which an advance
 ruling is requested, for the purpose of determining
 whether the good satisfies a regional value-content
 requirement under Chapter Four;

     (d) the appropriate basis or method for reasonably
 allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation
 methods set out in the Uniform Regulations, for
 calculating the net cost of a good, or the value of an
 intermediate material, for which an advance ruling is
 requested, for the purposes of determining whether the
 good satisfies a regional value-content requirement
 under Chapter Four;

     (e) whether a good that re-enters its territory after the
 good has been exported from its territory to the
 territory of another Party for repair or alteration
 qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with
 Article 307 (Goods Re-entered After Repair or
 Alteration); 

     (f) whether the proposed or actual marking of a good
 satisfies country of origin marking requirements under
 Article 312 (Country of Origin Marking); or

     (g) whether a good to be imported qualifies as a good of a
 Party under Annexes 300-B or 302.2.

2.   Each Party shall provide that an advance ruling issued
pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be based on:
 
     (a) for the purpose of determining the origin of a good,
 Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), the principles of the
 Customs Valuation Code and the Uniform Regulations;  

     (b) for the purpose of determining country of origin
 marking, Article 312 (Country of Origin Marking); and

     (c) for the purpose of determining whether a good qualifies
 as a good of a Party, Annex 302.2.

the information reasonably required to process an application.

4.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration:

 an application for an advance ruling, request
 supplemental information from the person requesting the
 ruling; 

     (b) after it has obtained all necessary information from
 the person requesting an advance ruling, shall issue
 the ruling in accordance with the time periods
 specified in the Uniform Regulations; and

     (c) where the advance ruling is unfavorable to the person
 requesting it, shall provide that person with a full
 explanation of the reasons for the ruling.

5.   Subject to paragraph 7, each Party shall apply an advance
ruling to importations into its territory of the good for which
the ruling was requested, commencing on the date of its issuance
or such later date as may be specified therein.

6.   Each Party shall provide to any person requesting an advance
ruling the same treatment, including the same interpretation and
application of the provisions of Chapter Four (Rules of Origin)
regarding a determination of origin of a good, as it provided to
any other person to whom it issued an advance ruling, provided
that the facts and circumstances are identical in all material
respects.

7.   The issuing Party may modify or revoke an advance ruling:

     (a) if the ruling is based on an error

     (i) of fact,

     (ii) in the tariff classification of a good or the
 materials subject to the ruling, 

     (iii) in the application of a regional value-
 content requirement under Chapter Four (Rules

 whether a good qualifies as a good of a Party
 under Annexes 300-B or 302.2;

     (b) if the ruling is not in accordance with an
 interpretation agreed by the Parties regarding Chapter
 Three (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods)
 and Chapter Four (Rules of Origin);

 Four, Marking Rules or Uniform Regulations; or  

     (e) to conform with a judicial decision or a change in its
 domestic law.

8.   Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation
of an advance ruling shall be effective on the date on which the
modification or revocation is issued, or on such later date as
may be specified therein, and shall not be applied to
importations of a good that have occurred prior to that date,
unless the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not
acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.  

9.   Notwithstanding paragraph 8, the issuing Party shall
postpone the effective date of such modification or revocation
for a period not exceeding 90 days where the person to whom the
advance ruling was issued has in good faith relied to its
detriment on that ruling.

10.  Each Party shall provide that where its customs
administration examines the regional value-content of a good for
which it has issued an advance ruling with respect to an approved
basis or method of customs value under Article 509(1)(c), or with
respect to an approved basis or method for reasonably allocating
costs under Article 509(1)(d), or with respect to whether a good

evaluate whether:

     (a) the exporter or producer has complied with the terms
 and conditions of the advance ruling;

     (b) the exporter's or producer's operations are consistent
 with the material facts and circumstances upon which

has not been satisfied, it may modify or revoke the advance
ruling as the circumstances may warrant.  

12.  Each Party shall provide that, where a person can
demonstrate that it used reasonable care and acted in good faith
in presenting the facts and circumstances on which an advance
ruling was based, and where the customs administration of a Party
determines that the ruling was based on incorrect information,
the person to whom such advance ruling was issued shall not be
subject to penalties.

13.  Where a Party issues an advance ruling to a person that has
misrepresented or omitted material facts or circumstances upon
which the ruling is based or has failed to act in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such ruling, it may apply such
measures as the circumstances may warrant.

Article 601: Principles

1.   The Parties confirm their full respect for their
Constitutions.

2.   The Parties recognize that it is desirable to strengthen the
important role that trade in energy and basic petrochemical goods
play in the North American region and to enhance this role
through sustained and gradual liberalization.

3.   The Parties recognize the importance of having viable and
internationally competitive energy and petrochemical sectors to
further their individual national interests.


Article 602: Scope and Coverage

1.   This Chapter applies to measures relating to energy and
basic petrochemical goods originating in the territories of the
Parties and to measures relating to investment and services
associated with such energy and basic petrochemical goods, as set
forth in this Chapter.

2.   For purposes of this Chapter, energy and basic petrochemical
goods refer to those goods classified under the Harmonized System
as:

     (a) Chapter 27 (excluding: subheadings 2707.10, 2707.20,
 2707.30, 2707.40, 2707.60, 2707.91, 2707.99 (except

prohibitions or restrictions on trade in energy and basic
petrochemical goods.  The Parties agree that this language does
not incorporate their respective protocols of provisional
application to the GATT.

2.   The Parties understand that the provisions of the GATT
incorporated in paragraph 1 prohibit, in any circumstances in
which any other form of quantitative restriction is prohibited,
minimum or maximum export-price requirements and, except as
permitted in enforcement of countervailing and antidumping orders
and undertakings, minimum or maximum import-price requirements.

3.   In circumstances where a Party imposes a restriction on
importation from or exportation to a non-Party of an energy or
basic petrochemical good, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to prevent the Party from:

     (a) limiting or prohibiting the importation from the
 territory of any Party of such energy or basic
 petrochemical good of the non-Party; or

     (b) requiring as a condition of export of such energy or
 basic petrochemical good of the Party to the territory
 of any other Party that the good be consumed within the
 territory of the other Party.

4.   In the event that a Party imposes a restriction on imports
of an energy or basic petrochemical good from non-Party
countries, the Parties, upon request of any Party, shall consult
with a view to avoiding undue interference with or distortion of
pricing, marketing and distribution arrangements in another
Party.

5.   Parties may administer a system of import and export
licensing for energy and basic petrochemical goods provided that
such system is operated in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement, including paragraph 1 and Article
1502 (Monopolies and State Enterprises).

6.   In addition, the Parties recognize the provisions of
Annex 603.6.


Article 604: Export Taxes

     No Party shall maintain or introduce any tax, duty, or
charge on the export of any energy or basic petrochemical good to
the territory of any other Party, unless such tax, duty, or
charge is also maintained or introduced on such energy or basic
petrochemical good when destined for domestic consumption.


Article 605: Other Export Measures

     A Party may maintain or introduce a restriction otherwise
justified under the provisions of Articles XI:2(a) and XX(g), (i)
and (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of an energy or
basic petrochemical good to the territory of another Party, only
if:

     (a) the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the
 total export shipments of a specific energy or basic
 petrochemical good made available to such other Party
 relative to the total supply of that good of the Party
 maintaining the restriction as compared to the
 proportion prevailing in the most recent 36-month
 period for which data are available prior to the
 imposition of the measure, or in such other
 representative period on which the Parties involved may
 agree;

     (b) the Party does not impose a higher price for exports of
 an energy or basic petrochemical good to such other
 Party than the price charged for such energy good when
 consumed domestically, by means of any measure such as
 licenses, fees, taxation and minimum price
 requirements.  The foregoing provision does not apply
 to a higher price which may result from a measure taken
 pursuant to subparagraph (a) that only restricts the
 volume of exports; and 

     (c) the restriction does not require the disruption of
 normal channels of supply to such other Party or normal
 proportions among specific energy or basic
 petrochemical goods supplied to the other Party such
 as, for example, between crude oil and refined products
 and among different categories of crude oil and of
 refined products.


Article 606: Energy Regulatory Measures

1.   The Parties recognize that energy regulatory measures are
subject to the disciplines of:

     (a) national treatment, as provided in Article 301;

     (b) import and export restrictions, as provided in Article
 603; or 

     (c) export taxes, as provided in Article 604.

2.   Each Party shall seek to ensure that in the application of
any energy regulatory measure, energy regulatory bodies within
its territory avoid disruption of contractual relationships to
the maximum extent practicable, and provide for orderly and
equitable implementation appropriate to such measures.


Article 607: National Security Measures

1.   No Party shall maintain or introduce a measure restricting
imports of an energy or basic petrochemical good from, or exports
of an energy or basic petrochemical good to, another Party under
Article XXI of the GATT or under Article 2102 (National
Security), except to the extent necessary to:

     (a) supply a military establishment of a Party or enable
 fulfillment of a critical defense contract of a Party;

     (b) respond to a situation of armed conflict involving the
 Party taking the measure;

     (c) implement national policies or international agreements
 relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons or
 other nuclear explosive devices; or

     (d) respond to direct threats of disruption in the supply
 of nuclear materials for defense purposes.

2.   The Parties recognize the provisions of Annex 607.2.


Article 608: Miscellaneous Provisions

1.   Canada and the United States shall act in accordance with
the terms of Annexes 902.5 and 905.2 of the Canada - United
States Free Trade Agreement.

2.   The Parties agree to allow existing or future incentives for
oil and gas exploration, development and related activities in
order to maintain the reserve base for these energy resources.

3.   Canada and the United States intend no inconsistency between
the provisions of this Chapter and the Agreement on an
International Energy Program (IEP).  In the event of any
unavoidable inconsistency between the IEP and this Chapter, the
provisions of the IEP shall prevail to the extent of that
inconsistency as between Canada and the United States.

3.   Natural Gas and Petrochemical Feedstock Trade

     Where end-users and suppliers of natural gas or basic
petrochemical goods consider that cross-border trade in such
goods may be in their interests, the Parties agree that such
end-users and suppliers, and state enterprises of the Parties as
may be required under their domestic law, shall have the right to
negotiate supply contracts.

     The modalities of implementing such arrangements are left to
the end-users, suppliers and state enterprises of the Parties as
may be required under their domestic law and may take the form of
individual contracts between the state enterprise and each of the
other entities.  Such contracts may be subject to regulatory
approval.

     (b) The opportunities for private investment in Mexico in
 electricity generating facilities include:

     (i) Production for Own Use

     Enterprises of the other Parties may acquire,
establish, and/or operate an electrical generating
facility to meet its own supply needs. Electricity
generated in excess of the enterprise's own supply
requirements must be sold to CFE and CFE shall
purchase such electricity under terms and

in Mexico. Electricity generated by IPP facilities
for sale in Mexico shall be sold to CFE and CFE
shall purchase such electricity under terms and
conditions agreed to by CFE and the enterprise.
Where an IPP located in Mexico and an electric
utility of another Party consider that cross-
border trade in electricity may be in their
interest, the Parties agree that these entities
and CFE shall have the right to negotiate the
terms and conditions of power purchase and power
sale contracts.  The modalities of implementing
such supply arrangements is left to the end-users,
suppliers and CFE and may take the form of
individual contracts between the state enterprise
and each of the other entities.  Such contracts
shall be subject to regulatory approval.

                               Chapter Seven

                                Agriculture



Article 701: Scope 

1.   This Chapter applies to trade in agricultural goods and to
sanitary and phytosanitary measures.


                       Subchapter A - Market access


Article 702: Scope

1.   Further to Article 102 (Objectives), the provisions of this
Subchapter address import barriers, domestic support, export
subsidies, and grading and marketing standards and measures that
affect trade of agricultural goods between the Parties.

2.   To the extent of any inconsistency in this Agreement with
the provisions of this Subchapter, this Subchapter shall prevail.


Article 703: International obligations

1.   Each Party shall comply with Annex 703.1 with respect to its
agricultural trade under other international agreements, to the
extent set out in that Annex.

2.   When a Party desires to adopt a measure pursuant to any
international commodity agreement with respect to an agricultural
good, it shall consult with the other Parties in order to avoid
nullification or impairment of a concession granted by such Party
in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2.

3.   Each Party shall comply with Annex 703.3 with respect to
actions taken pursuant to any international coffee agreement.


Article 704: Market Access

     General Provisions

1.   In order to facilitate trade in agricultural goods, the
Parties shall work together to improve access to their respective
markets through the reduction or elimination of import barriers.

     Tariffs and Quantitative Restrictions

2.   Each Party shall comply with Annex 704.2 with respect to
tariffs and quantitative restrictions, including GATT market
access requirements and trade in sugar.

     Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards

3.   Each Party shall comply with Annex 704.3 with respect to
agricultural grading and marketing standards.

     Special Safeguard Provisions

4.   Each Party may, during the applicable period of transition,
adopt or maintain special safeguards in the form of tariff quotas
on specific agricultural goods, as specified in its Schedule set
out in Annex 302.2, and further described in Annex 704.4.

5.   A Party may not apply, at the same time, measures under
paragraph 4 and Chapter 8 (Emergency Action) with respect to the
same agricultural good.


Article 705:   Domestic Support

     The Parties recognize that domestic support measures can be
of crucial importance to their agricultural sectors but may also
have trade distorting effects and effects on production.  The
Parties further recognize that domestic support commitments may
result from the agriculture negotiations in the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT.  Accordingly, to
the extent a Party decides to support its agricultural producers,
such Party should endeavor to move toward domestic support
policies that:

     (a)  have minimal or no trade distortion effects or effects
 on production; or

     (b) are exempt from domestic support reduction commitments
 under the GATT.

The Parties further recognize that the domestic support
mechanisms of each Party, including those that are subject to
reduction commitments, may be changed at the Party's discretion
so long as such change is in compliance with its GATT rights and
obligations.


Article 706: Export Subsidies

1.   The Parties recognize that export subsidies may have serious
prejudicial effects on importing and exporting Parties, and the
Parties share the objective of achieving the multilateral
elimination of export subsidies for agricultural goods.  The
Parties shall cooperate in an effort to achieve an agreement in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which eliminates
export subsidies on agricultural goods.

2.   The Parties also recognize that export subsidies may cause
disruption in the market of an importing Party.  Accordingly, the
Parties affirm that it is inappropriate for a Party to provide
export subsidies for the export of an agricultural good to the
territory of another Party when there are no other subsidized
imports of that good into that other Party.

3.   Except as provided in Annex 703.1, where an exporting Party
considers that a non-Party is exporting an agricultural good into
the territory of another Party with the benefit of export
subsidies, the exporting Party may request consultations with the
importing Party with a view toward agreeing on measures that the
importing Party could adopt to counter the effect of such
subsidized imports.  If the importing Party adopts the
agreed-upon measures, the exporting Party shall refrain from
applying, or immediately cease to apply, any export subsidy to
exports of such good into the territory of the importing Party.

4.   Except as provided in Annex 703.1, a Party proposing to
introduce an export subsidy on exports of an agricultural good to
the territory of another Party shall notify such Party at least
three days in advance, and shall upon request consult with such
Party, within 72 hours of receipt of the request, with a view to
eliminating the subsidy or minimizing any adverse impact on the
importing Party's market for that good.  Another Party may
request to join such consultations.

5.   Each Party shall take into account the interests of the
other Parties in the use of any export subsidy on an agricultural
good exported to a Party or non-Party, recognizing that such
subsidies may have prejudicial effects on the interests of the
other Parties.

6.   The Parties shall establish a Working Group on Agricultural
Subsidies which shall meet at least semi-annually, or at such
other times as the Parties may agree, to work toward elimination
of all export subsidies in connection with trade in agricultural
goods between the Parties.  The functions of the Working Group on
Agricultural Subsidies shall include:

     (a) monitoring the volume and price of imports of
 agricultural goods that have benefitted from export
 subsidies into the territory of any Party;

     (b) providing a forum for the Parties to develop mutually
 acceptable criteria and procedures for reaching
 agreement on the limitation or elimination of the
 provision of export subsidies in connection with
 importation of agricultural goods into the territories
 of the Parties; and

     (c) reporting annually to the Committee on Agricultural
 Trade, established under Article 708, with respect to
 implementation of this Article.

7.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article:

     (a) if the Parties agree to a particular export subsidy
 measure on an agricultural good for export to the
 territory of a Party, the exporting Party may adopt or
 maintain such measure; and

     (b) each Party shall retain its rights to apply
 countervailing duties to subsidized imports from any
 source.


Article 707: Resolution of Private Commercial Disputes
 Regarding Transactions in Agricultural Goods

     The advisory committee established pursuant to Article
2022(4)  shall work toward a system for resolving private
commercial disputes that arise in connection with transactions in
agricultural goods.  The system of each Party shall be designed
to achieve prompt and effective resolution of such disputes with
attention to special circumstances, including the perishability
of the goods involved.


Article 708: Committee on Agricultural Trade

1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Agricultural
Trade, comprising representatives of each Party.

2.   The Committee's functions shall include:

     (a) monitoring and promoting cooperation on the
 implementation and administration of this Subchapter;

     (b) providing a forum for the Parties to consult at least
 semi-annually and at such other times as the Parties
 may agree on issues related to this Subchapter; and

1.   The Parties recognize that, upon the date of entry into
force of the Agreement, each Party, in accordance with the rights
and obligations set forth in Chapter 3, will not adopt or
maintain measures regarding quantitative restrictions on the
importation of agricultural goods originating in each other's
territory, but may apply tariff quotas as set forth in its
Schedule set out in Annex 302.2.  The Parties further recognize
that the over-quota tariff rate applied by a Party in connection
with such tariff quotas will be progressively eliminated in the
manner set forth in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2.

of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with respect to any
measure taken in connection with the importation of agricultural
goods originating in the territory of the other.

3.   Except as provided in paragraph 4, to the extent a tariff
applied by a Party in accordance with a tariff quota as set forth
in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2 at any time exceeds the
applicable bound rate of duty for that agricultural good as set
forth in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions as of June 12,

 the territory of Mexico; or

     (b) imported into the territory of Mexico from the
 territory of the United States,

shall be eligible for the rate of duty provided in Annex 302.2

                                Appendix B

                              Trade in Sugar


1.   The United States and Mexico recognize the importance of
liberalizing trade in sugar and syrup goods while avoiding
conditions of entry that may result in displacement of the
consumption of such goods originating in the territories of the
United States and Mexico by imports from non-Parties. 
Accordingly, the United States and Mexico have agreed to the
following provisions to govern trade between them in sugar and
syrup goods.

2.   The over quota customs duty for imports into the territory
of the United States of sugar and syrup goods originating in the
territory of Mexico shall be reduced to zero during a period of
15 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement as
follows: 

     (a) from the first to the sixth year after the date of
 entry into force of this Agreement, the customs duty
 shall be reduced by a total of 15 percent in equal
 annual stages;

     (b) from the seventh to the fifteenth year after the date
 of entry into force of this Agreement, the customs duty
 shall be removed entirely in equal annual stages; and

     (c) after the end of the sugar transition period, the duty
 on all imports of sugar and syrup goods from Mexico
 shall be zero.

3.   In addition to the customs duty reductions provided for
under paragraph 2, imports into the territory of the United
States of sugar and syrup goods originating in the territory of
Mexico shall be duty free for a quantity, on a marketing year
(October 1 - September 30) basis, to be determined as follows:

     (a) for each upcoming marketing year in which Mexico is not
 projected to be a net surplus producer, the quantity
 shall be the greater of 7,258 metric tons raw value or
 the quota allocated by the United States for a non-
 Party within the category designated "other specified
 countries and areas" under paragraph (b)(i) of
 additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the Harmonized
 Tariff Schedule of the United States;

     (b) for each upcoming marketing year in which Mexico is
 projected to be a net surplus producer of sugar, in
 accordance with sub-paragraph (d), the quantity shall
 be the greater of (i) the amount specified in sub-
 section (a), or (ii) Mexico's projected net production
 surplus, but not greater than a maximum quantity as
 follows
 
     (i) for each of the first through sixth marketing
 years after the date of entry into force of this
 Agreement, 25,000 metric tons raw value,

     (ii) for the seventh marketing year after the date of
 entry into force of this Agreement, 150,000 metric
 tons raw value, and

     (iii) for each of the eighth through fifteenth
 marketing years after the date of entry into
 force of this Agreement, 110 percent of the
 previous marketing year's maximum quantity;

     (c) in any year after the sixth year after the date of
 entry into force of this Agreement, the quantity of
 imports of sugar and syrup goods originating in the
 territory of Mexico shall not be subject to the
 limitations set out in subparagraph (b) if

          (i) Mexico has been a net surplus producer for any two
 consecutive marketing years, or

          (ii) Mexico has been a net surplus producer during the
 previous marketing year, and Mexico is projected
 to be a net surplus producer of sugar, in
 accordance with subparagraph (d), in the upcoming
 marketing year, unless Mexico ultimately is not a
 net surplus producer in that marketing year; and

          (d) prior to the beginning of each marketing year, Mexico
 shall make projections of its domestic production and
 total consumption of sugar.  Mexico and the United
 States shall consult by July 1 of each year to jointly
 determine whether Mexico is projected to be a net
 surplus producer in the upcoming marketing year, in
 accordance with the methodology and sources of
 information set out in Schedule 704.2(I)(B)(3).

4.   Mexico shall implement a tariff quota to be applied on a
Most Favored Nation basis for sugar and syrup goods with customs
duties equal to those of the United States no later than six
years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 
Mexico shall thereafter progressively eliminate its over quota
customs duty for imports of sugar and syrup goods originating in
the territory of the United States, in identical fashion as the
reductions provided for United States customs duties in paragraph
2.  Mexico shall establish the quantities of imports of sugar and
syrup goods originating in the territory of the United States
that shall be duty-free pursuant to the same procedure by which
the United States shall establish such quantities with respect to
imports of such goods originating in the territory of Mexico in
accordance with sub-paragraph 3(b).  The United States shall make
projections of its domestic production and consumption, and the
United States and Mexico shall consult and make the determination
whether the United States is projected to be a net surplus
producer, on the same terms as provided for in subparagraph 3(d).

5.   If the United States eliminates its tariff quota for sugar
and syrup goods imported from non-Parties, at such time the
United States shall grant to Mexico the better of the treatment,
as determined by Mexico, of:

     (a) the treatment provided for in paragraph 3; or

     (b) the Most-Favored-Nation treatment granted by the United
 States to non-Parties.

6.   The measurement of the quantity imported shall be based on
the actual weight of the imported sugar and syrup goods,
converted as appropriate to raw value, without regard to the
packaging in which the goods are imported or their presentation.

7.   With respect to imports into the territory of Mexico of
sugar and syrup goods, and products containing sugar or syrup,
from the territory of the United States,

     (a) Mexico shall accord preferential treatment in
 accordance with this Agreement when the following
 conditions apply

     (i) with respect to sugar and syrup goods no benefits
 under any re-export program or any like program
 have been or will be granted in connection with
 the export of those goods, and

     (ii) with respect to products containing sugar and
 syrup goods, no benefits under any re-export
 program or any like program have been or will be
 granted in connection with the export of those
 products;

     (b) the United States shall provide notification to Mexico
 of any export to Mexico, within two days of such
 export, for which the benefits of any re-export program
 or any other like program have been or will be claimed
 by the exporter; and

     (c) except as provided for in paragraph 8, Mexico shall
 accord Most Favored Nation treatment to all imports
 from the territory of the United States of sugar and
 syrup  goods with respect to which benefits under any
 re-export program or any like program shall have been
 claimed.

8.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article:

     (a) the United States shall grant duty-free treatment to
 imports of

          (i) raw sugar originating in the territory of Mexico
 that will be refined within the territory of the
 United States and re-exported to the territory of
 Mexico, and

          (ii) refined sugar originating in the territory of
 Mexico that has been refined from raw sugar
 previously produced within, and exported from, the
 territory of the United States;

          (b) Mexico shall grant duty-free treatment to imports of

          (i) raw sugar originating in the territory of the
 United States that will be refined within the
 territory of Mexico and re-exported to the
 territory of the United States, and

          (ii) refined sugar originating in the territory of the
 United States that has been refined from raw sugar
 previously produced within, and exported from, the
 territory of Mexico; and

     (c) imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to
 subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall not
 be subject to, or counted under, any quota of the
 importing Party.



                          Schedule 704.2(I)(B)(3)

                   Net Production Surplus Determination


1.   Methodology

     (a) The size of a Party's net production surplus, shall be
 determined in accordance with the following formula:

     (i) If a net production surplus has not been projected
 for any previous year, the formula shall be:

     NPS = (PPy - CPy)

     (ii) If a Party is projected to be a net surplus
 producer and has been projected to be a net
 surplus producer in a previous year, the Party's
 projected net production surplus shall be
 adjusted, to account for an underestimate or
 overestimate, as follows:
     
     NPS = (PPy - CPy) - ((PPys - CPys) - (PAys - CAys))

     where:

     NPS  = Net production surplus
     PP  = Projected Domestic Production of
 sugar
     CP  = Projected Total Consumption of
 sugar
      y  = upcoming marketing year
     ys  = most recent previous marketing year
 in which a net production surplus
 was projected
     PA  = Actual Domestic Production of sugar
     CA  = Actual Total Consumption of sugar

     (b) The net production surplus shall be determined in
 metric tons raw value.

     (c) For purpose of determining whether a Party is a net
 surplus producer, imported sugar shall not be treated
 as part of domestic production.

     (d) The domestic production of a Party shall not include
 sugar, that has been either processed or refined from
 sugar beets or sugar cane grown, or sugar processed or
 refined, outside of the territory of such Party.

     (e) When making projections of its net production surplus,
 each Party shall consider adjustments, in appropriate
 circumstances, to such projections to take into account
 a change in stocks for the current marketing year
 exceeding an upper bound calculated in accordance with
 the following formula:


     where:

     B = upper bound, expressed as a percentage

     F = the absolute value of the change in stocks
 from the beginning of the marketing year to
 the end of the marketing year, expressed as a
 percentage of beginning stocks and calculated
 in accordance with the following formula: 

                                 ³ Sb -  Se   ³
                           F =   ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´  x  100   
                                 ³     Sb    ³

 
     Sb = beginning stocks

     Se = ending stocks

     N  = previous marketing year, ranging from 1
 (first preceding year) to 5 (fifth preceding
 year)

2.   Sources of Information

     (a) For Mexico, statistics on production, consumption and
 stocks shall be provided by the Secretaria de
 Agricultura y Recursos Hidraulicos, the Secretaria de
 Comercio y Fomento Industrial, and the Secretaria de
 Hacienda y Credito Publico.

     (b) For the United States, statistics on production,
 consumption and stocks shall be provided by the United
 States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 
     (c) Each Party shall permit representatives from the other
 Party to observe and comment on the methodology it uses
 to prepare its data.


                                Section II

                             Mexico and Canada

1.   This Section shall apply only between Canada and Mexico.

2.   Each Party shall comply with Appendices A and B.


                                Appendix A

         Tariffs, Quantitative Restrictions and GATT Market Access

1.   Subject to the provisions of this Section, the Parties
recognize that, upon the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, each Party, in accordance with the rights and
obligations set forth in Chapter 3, will not adopt or maintain
measures regarding quantitative restrictions on the importation
of agricultural goods originating in each other's territory, but
may apply tariff quotas as set forth in its Schedule set out in
Annex 302.2.  The Parties further recognize that the over-quota
tariff rate applied by a Party in connection with such tariff
quotas will be progressively eliminated in the manner set forth
in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2.

2.   Except as provided in paragraph 3, to the extent a tariff
applied by a Party in accordance with a tariff quota as set forth
in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2 at any time exceeds the
applicable bound rate of duty for that agricultural good as set
forth in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions as of June 12,
1991, the other Party hereby waives its rights with respect to
the applicable bound rate of duty under GATT Article II,
notwithstanding the provisions of Article 103.

3.   If the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture enters
into force with respect to a Party, pursuant to which that Party
has agreed to convert its quantitative restrictions into tariff
quotas, that Party shall ensure that the over-quota tariff rates
it applies to agricultural goods of the other Party are not
greater than the lower of (a) the applicable over-quota tariff
rates set out in its Schedule set out in Annex 302.2 or (b) the
applicable over-quota tariff rates set out in its GATT Schedule
of Tariff Concessions.

4.   Market access afforded by a Party in accordance with its
Schedule set out in Annex 302.2 and applied to imports of
agricultural goods of another Party shall count, as between the
Parties, toward the satisfaction of market access commitments
which have been agreed upon under its GATT Schedule of Tariff
Concessions or which may be undertaken by the importing Party as
a result of any GATT agreement entering into force as to that
Party during the applicable transition period under this
Agreement.

5.   In respect of the dairy, poultry and egg goods designated in
Schedule 704.2(II)(A)(5), either Party may adopt or maintain
quantitative restrictions or tariffs consistent with its rights
and obligations under the GATT, with respect to such goods
originating in the territory of the other Party.

6.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Chapter 8 of this
Agreement and paragraph 5, neither Party shall introduce,
maintain or seek any quantitative restriction or any other
measure having equivalent effect on any agricultural goods
covered under this Subchapter originating in the territory of the
other Party.

7.   Subject to this Section, Canada and Mexico incorporate their
respective rights and obligations with respect to agricultural
goods under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and
agreements negotiated under the GATT, including the rights and
obligations under GATT Article XI.  

8.   Notwithstanding paragraph 7 and Annex 301.3(A)(1)(j), the
rights and obligations contained in Article XI:2(c)(i) of the
GATT shall apply only to dairy, poultry and egg goods of Canada
and Mexico designated in Schedule 704.2(II)(A)(5).

9.   A good provided for in item 1806.10.a1 or 2106.90.a1 that
is:

     (a) imported into the territory of Canada from the
 territory of Mexico; or

     (b) imported into the territory of Mexico from the
 territory of Canada,

shall be eligible for the rate of duty provided in Annex 302.2
only if all materials provided in subheading 1701.99 used in the
production of such good are originating materials.

1.   When either the United States or Mexico adopts or maintains
a measure regarding the classification, grading or marketing of a
domestic agricultural good, it shall, with respect to the like
agricultural good imported from the territory of the other

the treatment it accords under the measure to the domestic
agricultural good destined for processing.  The importing Party
may also adopt or maintain measures to ensure that such imported
good is processed.

2.   Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the rights of
either the United States or Mexico under the GATT or under

            Subchapter B - Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures



Article 751: Scope

     In order to establish a framework of rules and disciplines
to guide the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary
and phytosanitary measures, this Subchapter applies to any such
measure of a Party that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade
between the Parties.


Article 752: Relation to Other Chapters

     Articles 301 (National Treatment), 309 (Import and Export
Restrictions) and 310 (Non-Discriminatory Administration of
Restrictions), and the provisions of Article XX(b) of the GATT as
incorporated into Article 2101(1), do not apply to any sanitary
or phytosanitary measure.


Article 753: Reliance on Non-Governmental Entities

     Each Party shall ensure that any non-governmental entity on
which it relies in applying a sanitary or phytosanitary measure
acts in a manner consistent with this Subchapter.


Article 754: Basic Rights and Obligations

     Right to Take Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures

1.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Subchapter, adopt,
maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure necessary
for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health in
its territory, including a measure more stringent than an
international standard, guideline or recommendation.

     Right to Establish Level of Protection

2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this  Subchapter,
each Party may, in protecting human, animal or plant life or
health, establish its appropriate level of protection in
accordance with Article 757.

     Scientific Principles

3.   Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary
measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is:

     (a) based on scientific principles, taking into account
 relevant factors including, where appropriate,
 different geographic conditions;

     (b) not maintained where there is no longer a scientific
 basis for it; and

     (c) based on a risk assessment, as appropriate to the
 circumstances.

     Non-Discriminatory Treatment

4.   Each Party shall ensure that a sanitary or phytosanitary
measure that it adopts, maintains or applies does not arbitrarily
or unjustifiably discriminate between its goods and like goods of
another Party, or between goods of another Party and like goods
of any other country, where identical or similar conditions
prevail.

     Unnecessary Obstacles

5.   Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary
measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is applied only to
the extent necessary to achieve its appropriate level of
protection, taking into account technical and economic
feasibility.

     Disguised Restrictions

6.    No Party may adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or
phytosanitary measure with a view to, or with the effect of,
creating a disguised restriction to trade between the Parties.


Article 755: International Standards and Standardizing
 Organizations

1.   Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal,
or plant life or health, each Party shall use, as a basis for its
sanitary and phytosanitary measures, relevant international
standards, guidelines or recommendations with the objective,
among others, of making its sanitary and phytosanitary measures
equivalent or, where appropriate, identical to those of the other
Parties.

2.   A Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure that conforms to
a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation
shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 754. A measure
that results in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection
different from that which would be achieved by a measure based on
a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation
shall not for that reason alone be presumed to be inconsistent
with this Subchapter.

3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and in accordance with the other
provisions of this Subchapter, a Party may adopt, maintain or
apply a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that is more stringent
than the relevant international standard, guideline or
recommendation.

4.   Where a Party has reason to believe that a sanitary or
phytosanitary measure of another Party is adversely affecting or
may adversely affect its exports and the measure is not based on
a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation,
it may request, and the other Party shall provide in writing, the
reasons for such measure.

5.   Each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable,
participate in relevant international and North American
standardizing organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius
Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, the
International Plant Protection Convention, and the North American
Plant Protection Organization, with a view to promoting the
development and periodic review of international standards,
guidelines and recommendations.


Article 756: Equivalence

1.   Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal,
or plant life or health, the Parties shall, to the greatest
extent practicable and in accordance with this Subchapter, pursue
equivalence of their respective sanitary or phytosanitary
measures.

2.   Each importing Party:

     (a) shall treat a sanitary or phytosanitary measure adopted
 or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to
 its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with
 the importing Party, provides to the importing Party
 scientific evidence or other information, in accordance
 with risk assessment methodologies agreed upon by those
 Parties, to demonstrate objectively, subject to
 subparagraph (b), that the exporting Party's measure
 achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of
 protection;

     (b) may, where it has a scientific basis, determine that
 the exporting Party's measure does not achieve the
 importing Party's appropriate level of protection; and

     (c) shall, upon the request of the exporting Party, provide
 its reasons in writing for a determination under
 subparagraph (b).

3.   For purposes of establishing equivalency, each exporting
Party shall, upon the request of an importing Party, take such
reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate
access in its territory for inspection, testing, and other
relevant procedures.

4.   Each Party should, in the development of a sanitary or
phytosanitary measure, consider relevant actual or proposed
sanitary or phytosanitary measures of the other Parties.


Article 757: Risk Assessment and Appropriate Level of
 Protection

1.   In conducting a risk assessment, each Party shall take into
account:

     (a) relevant risk assessment techniques and methodologies
 developed by international or North American
 standardizing organizations;

     (b) relevant scientific evidence;

     (c) relevant processes and production methods;

     (d) relevant inspection, sampling, and testing methods;

     (e) the prevalence of relevant diseases or pests, including
 the existence of pest-free or disease-free areas or
 areas of low pest or disease prevalence;

     (f) relevant ecological and other environmental conditions;
 and

     (g) relevant treatments, such as quarantines.

2.   Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in establishing
its appropriate level of protection regarding the risk associated
with the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or
plant pest or disease, and in assessing such risk, also take into
account the following economic factors, where relevant:

     (a) loss of production or sales that may result from such
 pest or disease;

     (b) costs of control or eradication of the pest or disease
 in its territory; and

     (c) the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative
 approaches to limiting risks.

3.   Each Party, in establishing its appropriate level of
protection:

     (a) should take into account the objective of minimizing
 negative trade effects; and

     (b) shall, with the objective of achieving consistency in
 such levels, avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable
 distinctions in such levels in different circumstances,
 where such distinctions result in arbitrary or
 unjustifiable discrimination against a good of another
 Party or constitute a disguised restriction on trade
 between the Parties.

4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) and Article
754(3)(c), where a Party conducting a risk assessment determines
that available relevant scientific evidence or other information
is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a
provisional sanitary or phytosanitary measure on the basis of
available relevant information, including from international or
North American standardizing organizations and from sanitary or
phytosanitary measures of other Parties. Such Party shall, within
a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the
assessment is presented to it, complete its assessment, review
and where appropriate revise the provisional measure in light of
such assessment.

5.   Where a Party is able to achieve its appropriate level of
protection through the phased application of a sanitary or
phytosanitary measure, it may, upon the request of another Party
and in accordance with this Subchapter, allow for such a phased
application, or grant specified exceptions for limited periods
from such measure, taking into account the requesting Party's
export interests.


Article 758: Adaptation to Regional Conditions

1.   Each Party shall adapt any of its sanitary or phytosanitary
measures relating to the introduction, establishment, or spread
of an animal or plant pest or disease, to the sanitary or
phytosanitary characteristics of the area where a good subject to
such measure is produced and the area in its territory to which
such good is destined, taking into account any relevant
conditions, including those relating to transportation and
handling, between such areas. In assessing such characteristics
of an area, including whether an area is, and is likely to
remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest
or disease prevalence, each Party shall take into account, among
other factors:

     (a) the prevalence of relevant pests or diseases in that
 area;

     (b) the existence of eradication or control programs in
 that area; and

     (c) any relevant international standard, guideline or
 recommendation.

2.   Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in determining
whether an area is a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of
low pest or disease prevalence, base such determination on
factors such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological
surveillance, and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary
controls in that area.

3.   Each importing Party shall recognize that an area in the
territory of the exporting Party is, and is likely to remain, a
pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease
prevalence, where the exporting Party provides to the importing
Party scientific evidence or other information sufficient to so
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the importing Party. For this
purpose, each exporting Party shall provide reasonable access in
its territory to the importing Party for inspection, testing and
other relevant procedures.

4.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Subchapter:

     (a) adopt, maintain or apply a different risk assessment
 procedure for a pest-free or disease-free area than for
 an area of low pest or disease prevalence; or

     (b) make a different final determination for the
 disposition of a good produced in a pest-free or
 disease-free area than for a good produced in an area
 of low pest or disease prevalence,

taking into account any relevant conditions, including those
relating to transportation and handling.

5.   Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining or applying a
sanitary or phytosanitary measure relating to the introduction,
establishment, or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease,
accord a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area in the
territory of another Party no less favorable treatment than it
accords a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area, in
another country, that poses the same level of risk. Such Party
shall use equivalent risk assessment techniques to evaluate
relevant conditions and controls in the pest-free or disease-free
area and in the area surrounding that area and take into account
any relevant conditions, including those relating to
transportation and handling.

6.   Each importing Party shall pursue an agreement with an
exporting Party, upon request, on specific requirements the
fulfillment of which allows a good produced in  an area of low
pest or disease prevalence in the territory of an exporting Party
to be imported into the territory of the importing Party and
achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.


Article 759: Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures

1.   Each Party, with respect to any control or inspection
procedure that it conducts:

     (a) shall initiate  and complete such procedure as
 expeditiously as possible and in no less favorable
 manner for a good of another Party than for a good of
 such Party or a like good of any other country;

     (b) shall publish the normal processing period for each
 such procedure or communicate the anticipated
 processing period to the applicant upon request;

     (c) shall ensure that the competent body

     (i) upon receipt of an application,  promptly examines
 the completeness of the documentation and informs
 the applicant in a precise and complete manner of
 any  deficiency, 

     (ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the
 results of the procedure in a form that is precise
 and complete so that such applicant may take any
 necessary  corrective action,

     (iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds
 as far as practicable with such  procedure if
 the applicant so requests, and 

     (iv) informs the applicant, upon request,  of the
 status of the application and the reasons for  any
 delay;

     (d) shall limit the information the applicant is required
 to supply to that necessary for conducting such
 procedure;

     (e) shall accord confidential or proprietary information
 arising from, or supplied in connection with, such
 procedure conducted for a good of another Party

     (i) treatment no less favorable than for a good of
 such Party, and 

     (ii) in any event, treatment that protects the
 applicant's legitimate commercial interests, to
 the extent provided under the Party's law;

     (f) shall limit any requirement regarding individual
 specimens or samples of a  good to that which is
 reasonable and necessary;

     (g) should not impose a fee for conducting such procedure
 that is higher for a good of another Party than is
 equitable in relation to any such fee it imposes for
 its like goods or for like goods of any other country,
 taking into account communication, transportation and
 other related costs;

     (h) should use criteria for selecting the location of
 facilities at which a procedure is conducted that do
 not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or
 its agent;

     (i) shall provide a mechanism to review complaints
 concerning the operation of such procedure and to take
 corrective action when a complaint is justified;

     (j) should use criteria for selecting samples of goods that
 do not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant
 or its agent; and

     (k) shall limit such procedure, for a good modified
 subsequent to a determination that such good fulfills
 the requirements of the applicable sanitary or
 phytosanitary measure, to that necessary to determine
 that such good continues to fulfill the requirements of
 such measure.

2.   Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be
necessary, paragraphs 1(a) through (i) to its approval
procedures.

3.   Where an importing Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure
requires the conduct of a control or inspection procedure at the
level of production, an exporting Party shall, upon the request
of the importing Party, take such reasonable measures as may be
available to it to facilitate access in its territory and to
provide assistance necessary to facilitate the conduct of the
importing Party's control or inspection procedure.

4.   A Party maintaining an approval procedure may require its
approval for the use of an additive, or its establishment of a
tolerance for a contaminant, in a food, beverage or feedstuff,
under such procedure, prior to granting access to its domestic
market for a food, beverage or feedstuff containing such additive
or contaminant. Where such Party so requires, it shall consider
using a relevant international standard, guideline or
recommendation as the basis for granting access until it
completes such procedure.


Article 760: Notification, Publication and Provision of
 Information

1.   Further to Articles 1802 and 1803, each Party proposing to
adopt or modify a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general

 notification of the type referred to in paragraphs 1(a)
 and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and

     (b) observance of paragraphs 1(c) and (d).

3.   Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent
problem relating to sanitary and phytosanitary protection, it may
omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 2, provided that, upon
adoption of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, it shall:

     (a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification
 of the type referred to in paragraph 1(b), including a
 brief description of the urgent problem;

     (b) provide a copy of such measure to any Party or

 such comments and the results of such discussions into
 account.

4.   Except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred
to in paragraph 3, each Party shall allow a reasonable period
between the publication of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of
general application and the date that it becomes effective to
allow time for interested persons to adapt to such measure.

5.   Each Party shall designate a government authority
responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the
notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the
other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more
government authorities for such purpose, it shall provide to the
other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope
of responsibility of each such authority.

6.   Where an importing Party denies entry into its territory of
a good of another Party because it does not comply with a
sanitary or phytosanitary measure, the importing Party shall
provide a written explanation to the exporting Party, upon
request, that identifies the applicable measure and the reasons
that the good is not in compliance.


Article 761: Inquiry Points

1.   Each Party shall ensure that there is one inquiry point that
is able to answer all reasonable enquiries from other Parties and
interested persons, and to provide relevant documents, regarding:

     (a) any sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general
 application, including any control or inspection
 procedure or approval procedure, proposed, adopted or
 maintained in its territory at the federal, provincial,

facilitate the provision of technical advice, information and
assistance, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to enhance
that Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures and related
activities, including research, processing technologies,
infrastructure and the establishment of national regulatory
bodies. Such assistance may include credits, donations and
grants, for the purpose of acquiring technical expertise,
training and equipment to allow the Party to adjust to and comply
with a Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure.

2.   Each Party shall, on the request of another Party:

     (a) provide to that Party information on its technical
 cooperation programs regarding sanitary or
 phytosanitary measures relating to specific areas of
 interest; and

     (b) consult with the other Party during the development of,
 or prior to the adoption or change in the application
 of, any sanitary or phytosanitary measure.


Article 763: Limitations on the Provision of Information

Party to:

     (a) communicate, publish texts or provide particulars or
 copies of documents other than in an official language
 of such Party; or

     (b) furnish any information the disclosure of which would
 impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the
 public interest or would prejudice the legitimate
 commercial interests of particular enterprises.

Article 801:  Bilateral Actions

1.   Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 and Annex 801, and during
the transition period only, if a good originating in the
territory of a Party, as a result of the reduction or elimination
of a duty provided for in this Agreement, is being imported into
the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in
absolute terms, and under such conditions so that the imports of
such good from that Party alone constitute a substantial cause of
serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry
producing a like or directly competitive good, the Party into
whose territory the good is being imported may, to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury:

     (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty
 provided for under this Agreement on such good; 

     (b) increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not
 to exceed the lesser of

     (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty
 in effect at the time the action is taken, or

     (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day
 immediately preceding the date of entry into force
 of this Agreement; or

     (c) in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal
 basis, increase the rate of duty to a level not to
 exceed the MFN applied rate of duty that was in effect
 on such good for the corresponding season immediately
 preceding the date of entry into force of this
 Agreement.

2.   The following conditions and limitations shall apply to a
proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 1:

     (a) a Party shall, without delay, deliver to any Party that
 may be affected written notice of, and a request for
 consultations regarding, the institution of a
 proceeding that could result in emergency action
 against a good originating in the territory of a  Party;

     (b) any such action shall commence not later than one year
 from the date of institution of the proceeding;

     (c) no action shall be maintained

     (i) for a period exceeding three years, except where
 the good against which the action is taken is
 provided for in the items in staging category C+
 of the Tariff Schedule of the Party taking the
 action, and that Party determines that the
 affected industry has undertaken adjustment and
 requires an extension of the period of relief, in
 which case the period of relief may be extended
 for one year provided that the duty applied during
 the initial period of relief is substantially
 reduced at the commencement of the extension
 period, or

     (ii) beyond the expiration of the transition period,
 except with the consent of the Party against whose
 good the action is taken;

     (d) no action shall be taken by a Party against any
 particular good originating in the territory of another
 Party more than once during the transition period; and

     (e) upon the termination of the action, the rate of duty
 shall be the rate that, according to the original
 Schedule for the staged elimination of the tariff,
 would have been in effect a year after the commencement
 of the action, and commencing January 1 of the year
 following the termination of the action, at the option
 of the Party that has taken the action

     (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the schedule in
 the Tariff Schedule of the Party, or

     (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual
 stages ending on the date set forth in the Tariff
 Schedule of the Party for the elimination of the
 tariff. 

3.   A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the
expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of 
serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry arising
from the operation of this Agreement only with the consent of the
Party against whose good the action would be taken.

4.   The Party taking an action pursuant to this Article shall
provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken
mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of
concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects to the
other Party, or equivalent to the value of the additional duties
expected to result from the action.  If the Parties are unable to
agree upon compensation, the Party against whose good the action
is taken may take tariff action having trade effects
substantially equivalent to the action taken under paragraph 1. 
The Party taking such tariff action shall apply the action only
for the minimum period necessary to achieve such substantially
equivalent effects.

5.   This Article does not apply to emergency actions respecting
goods covered by Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods).


Article 802: Global Actions

1.   Each Party shall retain its rights and obligations under
Article XIX of the GATT or any safeguard agreement pursuant
thereto except those regarding compensation or retaliation and
exclusion from an action to the extent that such rights or
obligations are inconsistent with this Article.  Any Party taking
an emergency action under Article XIX or any such agreement shall
exclude imports of a good from each other Party from such action
unless:

     (a) imports from a Party, considered individually, account
 for a substantial share of total imports; and

     (b) imports from a Party, considered individually, or in
 exceptional circumstances imports from Parties
 considered collectively, contribute importantly to the
 serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports.

2.   In determining whether:

     (a) imports from a Party, considered individually, account
 for a substantial share of total imports, such imports
 normally shall not be considered to account for a
 substantial share of total imports if such Party is not
 among the top five suppliers of the good subject to the
 proceeding, measured in terms of import share during
 the most recent three-year period; and

     (b) imports from a Party or Parties contribute importantly
 to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the competent
 investigating authority shall consider such factors as
 the change in the import share of each Party, and the
 level and change in the level of imports of each Party.
 In this regard, imports from a Party normally shall not
 be deemed to contribute importantly to serious injury,
 or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of imports
 from a Party during the period in which the injurious
 surge in imports occurred is appreciably lower than the
 growth rate of total imports from all sources over the
 same period. 

3.   A Party taking such action, from which a good from another
Party or Parties is initially excluded pursuant to paragraph 1,
shall have the right subsequently to include that good of the
other Party or Parties in the action in the event that the
competent investigating authority determines that a surge in
imports of such good of the other Party or Parties undermines the
effectiveness of such action.

4.   A Party shall, without delay, deliver written notice to the
other Parties of the institution of a proceeding that may result
in emergency action under paragraph 1 or 3.

5.   In no case shall a Party impose restrictions on a good in an
action under paragraph 1 or 3:

     (a) without delivery of prior written notice to the
 Commission, and without adequate opportunity for
 consultation with the Party or Parties against whose
 good the action is proposed to be taken, as far in
 advance of taking the action as practicable; and

     (b) that would have the effect of reducing imports of such
 good from a Party below the trend of imports of such
 good from that Party over a recent representative base
 period with allowance for reasonable growth.

6.   The Party taking an action pursuant to this Article shall
provide to the Party or Parties against whose good the action is
taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form
of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects to
that Party or Parties or equivalent to the value of the
additional duties expected to result from the action.  If such
Parties are unable to agree upon compensation, the Party against
whose good the action is taken may take action having trade
effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under
paragraph 1 or 3.


Article 803: Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings

1.   Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and
reasonable administration of its respective laws, regulations,
decisions and rulings governing all emergency action proceedings.

2.   Each Party shall entrust determinations of serious injury,
or threat thereof, in emergency action proceedings to a competent
investigating authority, subject to review by judicial or
administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by domestic law.
Negative injury determinations shall not be subject to
modification, except by such review.  The competent investigating
authority empowered under domestic law to conduct such
proceedings should be provided with the necessary resources to
enable it to fulfill its duties.

3.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely,
transparent and effective procedures for emergency action
proceedings, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex
803.

4.   This Article does not apply to emergency actions respecting
goods covered by Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods).


Article 804: Dispute Settlement in Emergency Action Matters

     No party may request the establishment of an arbitral panel
under Article 2008 regarding any proposed emergency action.

of the entry into force of this Agreement, except where the good
against which the action is taken is provided for in the items in
staging category C+ of the Tariff Schedule of the Party taking
the action, in which case the transition period shall be the
period of staged tariff elimination for that good.

                                 ANNEX 803

              Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings


1.   Institution of a Proceeding:

     (a) An emergency action proceeding may be instituted by a
 petition or complaint by entities specified in domestic
 law.  The entity filing the petition or complaint shall
 demonstrate that it is representative of the domestic
 industry producing a good like or directly competitive
 with the imported good. 

     (b) A Party may institute a proceeding on its own motion or
 request the competent investigating authority to
 conduct a proceeding.

2.   Contents of a petition or complaint.  When the basis for an
   investigation is a petition or complaint filed by an entity
   representative of a domestic industry, the petitioning
   entity shall, in its petition or complaint, provide the
   following information to the extent that such information is
   publicly available from governmental and other sources, and
   best estimates and the basis therefore if such information
   is not available:

     (a) Product description.  The name and description of the
 imported good concerned, the tariff subheading under
 which such good is classified, its current tariff
 treatment, and the  name and description of the like or
 directly competitive domestic good concerned, 

     (b) Representativeness:

     (i) The names and addresses of the entities filing the
 petition or complaint, and the locations of the
 establishments in which they produce the domestic
 good, 

     (ii) the percentage of domestic production of the like
 or directly competitive good that such entities
 account for and the basis for claiming that they
 are representative of an industry, and

     (iii) the names and locations of all other domestic
 establishments in which the like or directly
 competitive good is produced; 

     (c) Import data. Import data for each of the five most
 recent full years that form the basis of the claim that
 the good concerned is being imported in increased
 quantities, either in absolute terms or relative to
 domestic production;

     (d) Domestic production data. Data on total domestic
 production of the like or directly competitive good for
 each of the five most recent full years;

     (e) Data showing injury.  Quantitative and objective data
 indicating the nature and extent of injury to the
 concerned industry, such as data showing changes in the
 level of sales, prices, production, productivity,
 capacity utilization, market share, profits and losses,
 and employment;

     (f) Cause of injury.  An enumeration and description of the
 alleged causes of the injury, or threat thereof, and a
 summary of the basis for the assertion that increased
 imports, either actual or relative to domestic
 production, of the imported good are causing or
 threatening to cause serious injury, supported by
 pertinent data; and

     (g) Criteria for inclusion.  Quantitative and objective
 data indicating the share of imports accounted for by
 imports from the territory of each other Party and the
 petitioner's views on the extent to which such imports
 are contributing importantly to the serious injury, or
 threat thereof, caused by imports of that good.
 
3.   Petitions or complaints, except to the extent they contain
confidential business information, shall promptly be made
available for public inspection upon being filed.

4.   With respect to an emergency action proceeding instituted on
the basis of a petition or complaint filed by an entity asserting
that it is representative of the domestic industry, the competent
investigating authority shall not publish the notice required by
paragraph 6 without first assessing carefully that the petition
or complaint meets the requirements of paragraph 4, including
representativeness.

5.   Notice requirement. Upon instituting an emergency action
proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall publish
notice of the institution of the proceeding in the official
journal of the Party.  The notice shall identify: the petitioner
or other requester; the imported good that is the subject of the
proceeding and its tariff subheading; the nature and timing of
the determination to be made; the time and place of the public
hearing; dates of deadlines for filing briefs, statements, and
other documents; the place at which the petition and any other
documents filed in the course of the proceeding may be inspected;
and the name, address and telephone number of the office to be
contacted for more information. 

6.   Public hearing.  In the course of each such proceeding,
the competent investigating authority shall:

     (a) hold a public hearing, after providing reasonable
 notice, to allow all interested parties, and any
 association whose purpose is to represent the interests
 of consumers in the territory of the Party instituting
 the proceeding, to appear in person or by counsel, to
 present evidence, and to be heard on the questions of
 serious injury, or threat thereof, and the appropriate
 remedy; and

     (b) provide an opportunity to all interested parties and
 any such association appearing at the hearing to
 cross-question interested parties making presentations
 at that hearing.

7.   Confidential information.  The competent investigating
authority shall adopt or maintain procedures for the treatment of
confidential information, protected under domestic law, that is
provided in the course of a proceeding, including a requirement
that interested parties and consumer associations providing such
information furnish non-confidential written summaries thereof,
or if they indicate that such information cannot be summarized,
the reasons why a summary cannot be provided.

8.   Evidence of injury and causation:

     (a) In conducting its proceeding the competent
 investigating authority shall gather, to the best of
 its ability, all relevant information appropriate to
 the determination it must make.  It shall evaluate all
 relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable
 nature having a bearing on the situation of that
 industry, in particular, the rate and amount of the
 increase in imports of the good concerned, in absolute
 and relative terms, the share of the domestic market
 taken by increased imports, and changes in the level of
 sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization,
 profits and losses, and employment.  In making its
 determination, the competent investigating authority
 may also consider other economic factors, such as
 changes in prices and inventories, and the ability of
 firms in the industry to generate capital;

     (b) The competent investigating authority shall not make an
 affirmative injury determination unless its
 investigation demonstrates, on the basis of objective
 evidence, the existence of a clear causal link between
 increased imports of the good concerned and serious
 injury, or threat thereof.  When factors other than
 increased imports are causing injury to the domestic
 industry at the same time, such injury shall not be
 attributed to increased imports;

9.   Time period for deliberation.  Except in critical
circumstances and in global actions involving perishable
agricultural products, the competent investigating authority,
before making an affirmative determination in an emergency action
proceeding, shall allow sufficient time to gather and consider
the relevant information, hold a public hearing, and provide an
opportunity for all interested parties and consumer associations
to prepare and submit their views.

10.  The competent investigating authority shall publish promptly
a report, including a summary thereof, in the official journal of
the Party setting forth its findings and reasoned conclusions on
all pertinent issues of law and fact.  The report shall describe
the imported good and its tariff  item number, the standard
applied and the finding made.  The statement of reasons shall set
forth the basis for the determination, including a description
of:  the domestic industry seriously injured or threatened with
serious injury; information supporting a finding that imports are
increasing, the domestic industry is seriously injured or
threatened with serious injury, and increasing imports are
causing or threatening serious injury; and, if provided for by
domestic law, any finding or recommendation regarding the
appropriate remedy and the basis therefor.  In its report, the
competent investigating authority shall not disclose any
confidential information provided pursuant to any undertakings
concerning confidential information that may have been made in
the course of the proceedings.

                                PART THREE
                        TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE

                               Chapter Nine

                        Standards-Related Measures



Article 901: Scope

1.   This Chapter applies to any standards-related measure of a
Party, other than those covered by Chapter Seven, Subchapter B
(Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or
indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the
Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such
measures.

2.   Purchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies
for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall
be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement). 


Article 902: Extent of Obligations

1.   Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this
Chapter.

2.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to
ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by provincial or
state governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in
its territory.


Article 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers
 to Trade and Other Agreements

     Further to Article 104, the Parties affirm with respect to
each other their existing rights and obligations relating to
standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical
Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements,
including environmental and conservation agreements, to which
such Parties are party.

Article 904: Basic Rights and Obligations

     Right to Take Standards-Related Measures

1.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt,
maintain and apply standards-related measures, including those
relating to safety, the protection of human, animal and plant
life and health, the environment, and consumers, and measures to
ensure their enforcement or implementation.  Such measures
include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another
Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of
another Party that fails to comply with the applicable
requirements of such measures or to complete its approval
procedures.

     Right to Establish Level of Protection

2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each
Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the
protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the
environment, or consumers, establish the levels of protection
that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(3).

     Non-Discriminatory Treatment

3.   Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related
measures, accord to goods or service providers of another Party:

     (a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301
 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in
 Services); and

     (b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to
 like goods, or in like circumstances to service
 providers, of any other country.

     Unnecessary Obstacles

4.   No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any
standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of
creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. 
An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be
created if:

     (a) the demonstrable purpose of such measure is to achieve
 a legitimate objective; and

     (b) such measure does not operate to exclude goods of
 another Party that meet that legitimate objective.


Article 905: Use of International Standards

1.   Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related
measures, international standards or international standards
whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would
be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its
legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental
climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors,
scientific justification or the level of protection that the
Party considers appropriate.

2.   A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an
international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with
Article 904(3) and (4).

3.   Paragraph 1 shall not be construed to prevent a Party, in
pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining,
or applying any standards-related measure that results in a
higher level of protection than would be achieved if such measure
were based on an international standard.


Article 906: Compatibility and Equivalence

1.   Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures
in promoting and protecting legitimate objectives, the Parties
shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance
the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant
life and health, the environment and consumers.

2.   Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of
human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or
consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under
this Chapter, and taking into account international
standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest
extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-
related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service
between the Parties.

3.   Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, upon the
request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to
promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity
assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the
standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the
territory of the other Party. 

4.   Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation
adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its
own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing
Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party
that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing
Party's legitimate objectives.

5.   The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party,
upon request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical
regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.

6.   Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a
conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of
another Party, provided that it is satisfied that such procedure
offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure
it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results
of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies
with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or
maintained in the Party's territory.

7.   Prior to acceptance of results of a conformity assessment
procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in
the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment
results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical
competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved,
including verified compliance with relevant international
standards through such means as accreditation. 


Article 907: Assessment of Risk

1.   A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct
an assessment of risk.  In conducting such assessment, a Party
may consider, among other factors relating to a good or service:

     (a) available scientific evidence or technical information;

     (b) intended end uses;

     (c) processes or production, operating, inspection,
 sampling or testing methods; or 
     (d) environmental conditions.

2.   Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines
that available scientific evidence or other information is
insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a
provisional technical regulation on the basis of available
relevant information.  The Party shall, within a reasonable
period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of
risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and
where appropriate revise the provisional technical regulation in
light of such assessment.

3.   Where a Party pursuant to Article 904(2) establishes the
level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an
assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable
distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of
protection it considers appropriate, if such distinctions:

     (a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination
 against goods or service providers of another Party;

     (b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the
 Parties; or

     (c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the
 same use under the same conditions that pose the same
 level of risk and provide similar benefits.


Article 908: Conformity Assessment

1.   The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing
the existence of substantial differences in the structure,
organization, and operation of conformity assessment procedures
in their respective territories, make compatible to the greatest
extent practicable such procedures. 

2.   Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the
Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908(2), each
Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize
conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on
terms no less favorable than those accorded to such bodies in its
territory.

3.   With respect to a Party's conformity assessment procedure,
such Party shall:

     (a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is
 stricter, nor apply such procedure more strictly, than
 necessary to give it confidence that a good or a
 service conforms with an applicable technical
 regulation or standard, taking into account the risks
 that non-conformity would create;

     (b) initiate and complete such procedure as expeditiously
 as possible;

     (c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing
 of applications in non-discriminatory order;

     (d) publish the normal processing period for each such
 procedure or communicate the anticipated processing
 period to an applicant upon request;  

     (e) ensure that the competent body

     (i) upon receipt of an application, promptly
 examines the completeness of the documentation
 and informs the applicant in a precise and
 complete manner of any deficiency,  

     (ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible
 the results of the conformity assessment
 procedure in a form that is precise and complete
 so that such applicant may take any necessary
 corrective action, 

     (iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as
 far as practicable with such procedure if the
 applicant so requests, and

     (iv) informs the applicant, upon request, of the
 status of the application and the reasons for
 any delay; 

     (f) limit the information the applicant is required to
 supply to that necessary to conduct such procedure and
 to determine appropriate fees;

     (g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising
 from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of
 such procedure for a good of another Party or for a
 service provided by a person of another Party 

     (i) the same treatment as that for a good of such
 Party or a service provided by a person of such
 Party, and 

     (ii) in any event, treatment that protects an
 applicant's legitimate commercial interests to
 the extent provided under the Party's law;

     (h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting such
 procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a
 service provider of another Party than is equitable in
 relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or
 service providers or for like goods or service
 providers of any other country, taking into account
 communication, transportation and other related costs; 

     (i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a
 conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not
 cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its
 agent;

     (j) limit such procedure, for a good or service modified
 subsequent to a determination that such good or service
 conforms to the applicable technical regulation or
 standard, to that necessary to determine that such good
 or service continues to conform to such technical
 regulation or standard; and

     (k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to
 that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection
 of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to
 an applicant or its agent.

4.   Each Party shall apply, with appropriate modifications, the
relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.

5.   Each Party shall, upon the request of another Party, take
such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate
access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.

6.   Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request
by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual
recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity
assessment procedures.  


Article 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of
 Information

1.   Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803
(Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing
to adopt or modify a technical regulation, shall: 

     (a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification
 of such technical regulation, other than a law, publish
 a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the
 proposed measure in such a manner as to enable
 interested persons to become acquainted with such
 measure, except that in the case of any such measure
 related to perishable goods, each Party shall, to the
 greatest extent practicable, publish such notice and
 provide such notification at least 30 days prior to the
 adoption or modification of such measure, but no later
 than when notification is provided to domestic
 producers;

     (b) identify in such notice and notification the good or
 service to which the proposed measure would apply, and
 shall provide a brief description of the objective of,
 and reasons for, such measure;

     (c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or
 interested person that so requests, and shall, wherever
 possible, identify any provision that deviates in
 substance from relevant international standards; and

     (d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and
 interested persons to make comments in writing and
 shall, upon request, discuss such comments and take
 such comments and the results of such discussions into
 account.

2.   Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any
conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a
technical regulation shall, where an international standard
relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure
is not substantially the same as an international standard, and
where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of
the other Parties:

     (a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and
 provide a notification of the type required in
 paragraphs 1 (a) and (b); and

     (b) observe paragraphs 1 (c) and (d).

3.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to
ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or
provincial government other than a local government:

 notification of the type required under paragraphs 1
 (a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and

     (b) observance of paragraphs 1 (c) and (d).

4.   Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent
problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or
plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit
any step set out in paragraphs 1 or 3, provided that upon
adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:

     (a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification
 of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a
 brief description of the urgent problem;

     (b) provide a copy of such measure to any Party or
 interested person that so requests; and

     (c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and
 interested persons to make comments in writing, and
 shall, upon request, discuss such comments and take
 such comments and the results of such discussions into
 account.

5.   Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an
urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable
period between the publication of a standards-related measure and
the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested
persons to adapt to such measure.

6.   Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its
territory to be present during the process of development of
standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental
persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present.

7.   Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the development
of, amendment to, or change in the application of its standards-
related measures no later than the time at which it notifies non-
governmental persons in general or the relevant sector in its
territory.

8.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to
ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a provincial or
state government, and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in
its territory.

9.   Each Party shall designate a government authority
responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the
notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the
other Parties thereof.  Where a Party designates two or more
government authorities for such purpose, it shall provide to the
other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope
of responsibility of each such authority.

available to it to ensure that there is at least one enquiry
point that is able to answer all reasonable enquiries from other
Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents
or information as to where they can be obtained regarding:

     (a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure
 proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental
 standardizing bodies in its territory; and

     (b) the membership and participation of relevant non-
 governmental bodies in its territory in international

                                Chapter Ten

                          Government Procurement


Article 1001: Objectives

     The Parties shall strive to achieve the liberalization of
their measures regarding government procurement, as specified by
the obligations in this Chapter, so as to provide balanced,
non-discriminatory, predictable and transparent government
procurement opportunities for the suppliers of each Party.


Article 1002: Scope and Coverage

1.   Subject to Annexes 1002.1 through 1002.7, this Chapter applies
to any measure regarding the procurement of goods or services or
any combination thereof, by any entity listed in Annex 1002.1
(Federal Government Entities), Annex 1002.3 (Government
Enterprises) and, when completed, Annex 1002.2 (State and
Provincial Government Entities), where the value of the contract to
be awarded is estimated, at the time of publication of a notice in
accordance with Article 1010 (Invitation to Participate), to equal
or exceed the applicable threshold as set forth in paragraph 3.

2.   Where the contract to be awarded by the entity is not covered
by this Chapter, this Chapter shall not be construed to cover any
good or service component of that contract. However, no Party shall
prepare, design or otherwise structure any procurement contract in
order to avoid the obligations of this Chapter. 

3.   Subject to Annex 1002-A, the applicable thresholds in U.S.
dollars are:

     (a) for entities listed in Annex 1002.1 (Federal Government
 Entities),

     (i) $50,000 for goods contracts,

     (ii) $50,000 for services contracts, except for
 construction services contracts, and

     (iii) $6.5 million for construction services
 contracts; and

     (b) for entities listed in Annex 1002.3 (Government
 Enterprises)

     (i) $250,000 for goods contracts,

     (ii) $250,000 for services contracts, except for
 construction services contracts, and

     (iii) $8.0 million for construction services
 contracts.

4.   Threshold values are denominated in real terms and therefore
shall incorporate the inflation rate of the United States. The
United States shall, every two years, calculate and notify to the
other Parties the threshold values denominated in nominal terms
according to of Annex 1002.8 (1) (Indexation and Conversion of
Thresholds).

5.   Each Party shall comply with Annex 1002.8 with respect to the
calculation and conversion of the value of thresholds into national
currencies.

6.   For purposes of this Chapter, procurement includes procurement
by such methods as purchase, lease or rental, with or without an
option to buy, in accordance with the thresholds and coverage
applicable in this Chapter. Procurement does not include the
acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services, liquidation
and management services for regulated financial institutions and
sale and distribution services for government debt.

7.   As between any Parties who are also party to the GATT
Agreement on Government Procurement or any successor agreement to
which such Parties are party, this Chapter shall prevail to the
extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of such
agreement and this Chapter.


Article 1003: Valuation of Contracts

1.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities, in determining
whether any contract is subject to this Chapter, apply paragraphs
2 through 6 in calculating the value of that contract.

2.   An entity, in calculating the value of a contract, shall take
into account all forms of remuneration, including premiums, fees,
commissions and interest.

3.   An entity shall not select a valuation method, or divide
procurement requirements into separate contracts, to avoid the
application of this Chapter.

4.   Where an individual requirement for a procurement results in:

     (a) the award of more than one contract, or

     (b) in contracts being awarded in separate parts,

the basis for valuation shall be either:

     (c) the actual value of similar recurring contracts concluded
 over the previous fiscal year or 12 months adjusted,
 where possible, for anticipated changes in quantity and
 value over the subsequent twelve months; or

     (d) the estimated value of recurring contracts in the fiscal
 year or 12 months subsequent to the initial contract.

5.   In the case of a contract for lease or rental, with or without
an option to buy, or in the case of a contract that does not
specify a total price, the basis for valuation shall be:

     (a) in the case of a fixed-term contract, where the term is
 12 months or less, the total contract value for its
 duration or, where the term exceeds 12 months, the total
 contract value including the estimated residual value; or

     (b) in the case of a contract for an indefinite period, the
 estimated monthly installment multiplied by 48.

If the entity is uncertain as to whether a contract is for a fixed
or an indefinite term, the entity shall calculate the value of the
contract using the method set forth in subparagraph (b).

6.   In cases in which tender documentation specifies the need for
optional purchases, the basis for valuation shall be the total
value of the maximum permissible procurement, inclusive of all
possible optional purchases.


Article 1004: National Treatment and Non-discrimination

1.   With respect to all measures regarding government procurement
covered by this Chapter, each Party shall accord to goods of any
other Party, as determined in accordance with the rules of origin
referred to in Article 1005(1) (Rules of Origin), to services of
any other Party, as determined in accordance with Article 1005(2),
and to the suppliers of such goods or services, treatment no less
favorable than the most favorable treatment that it accords to:

     (a) goods, services and suppliers of that Party; and

     (b) goods, services and suppliers of any other Party.

2.   With respect to all measures regarding government procurement
covered by this Chapter, no Party may:

     (a) treat a locally established supplier less favorably than
 another locally established supplier on the basis of
 degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; or

     (b) discriminate against a locally established supplier if
 the goods or services offered by that supplier for the
 particular procurement are goods or services of any other
 Party.

3.   Paragraph 1 does not apply to customs duties and charges of
any kind imposed on or in connection with importation, the method
of levying such duties and charges, and other import regulations,
including restrictions and formalities.

4.   Each Party reserves the right to deny to an enterprise of any
other Party the benefits of this Chapter in accordance with the
provisions of Article 1113 (Denial of Benefits), except
subparagraph (a).


Article 1005: Rules of Origin

1.   No Party shall apply to goods that are imported from any other
Party for purposes of government procurement covered by this
Chapter, rules of origin that are different from or inconsistent
with the rules of origin the Party applies in the normal course of
trade, which will be the non-preferential rules set out in Chapter
Three (for country of origin marking purposes) at such time as they
become the rules of origin applied in the normal course of trade.

2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party
may deny to an enterprise that is a supplier of services of another
Party the benefits of this Chapter if:

     (a) nationals of any non-Party own or control that
 enterprise; and 

     (b) that enterprise has no substantial business activities in
 the territory of the Party under whose laws it is
 constituted.


Article 1006: Prohibition of Offsets

     Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not, in the
qualification and selection of suppliers, goods or services, or in
the evaluation of bids and the award of contracts, consider, seek
or impose offsets.


Article 1007: Technical Specifications

1.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not, with the
purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade,
prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification laying down:

     (a) the characteristics of the goods or services to be
 procured such as quality, performance, safety and
 dimensions, symbols, terminology, packaging, marking and
 labelling; 

     (b) the processes and methods for their production related to
 the goods characteristics; or 

     (c) requirements relating to conformity assessment.

2.   Each Party shall ensure that any technical specification
prescribed by its  entities is, where appropriate:

     (a) specified in terms of performance criteria rather than
 design or descriptive characteristics; and

     (b) based on international standards, national technical
 regulations, recognized national standards or building
 codes.

3.   Each Party shall ensure that the technical specifications
prescribed by its entities do not require or refer to a particular
trademark or name, patent, design or type, specific origin or
producer or service provider unless there is no sufficiently
precise or intelligible way of otherwise describing the procurement
requirements and provided that, in such cases, words such as "or
equivalent" are included in the tender documentation.

4.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not seek or
accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding
competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption
of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a
person that may have a commercial interest in that procurement.


Article 1008:Tendering Procedures

1.   Each Party shall ensure that the tendering procedures of its
entities:

     (a) are applied in a non-discriminatory manner; and

     (b) are consistent with the provisions of this Article and
 with Articles 1009 (Qualification of Suppliers) through
 1016 (Limited Tendering).

2.   In this regard, each Party shall ensure that its entities:

     (a) do not provide to any supplier information with regard to
 a specific procurement in a manner that would have the
 effect of precluding competition; and

     (b) provide all suppliers equal access to information with
 respect to a procurement during the period prior to the
 issuance of any notice or tender documentation.


Article 1009: Qualification of Suppliers

1.   No entity of a Party may, in the process of qualifying
suppliers in tendering procedures, discriminate between suppliers
of the other Parties or between domestic suppliers and suppliers of
the other Parties.

2.   The qualification procedures followed by an entity of a Party
shall be consistent with the following:

     (a) any conditions for participation by suppliers in
 tendering procedures shall be published sufficiently in
 advance so as to provide the suppliers adequate time to
 initiate and, to the extent that it is compatible with
 efficient operation of the procurement process, to
 complete the qualification procedures;

     (b) any conditions for participation by suppliers in
 tendering procedures, including financial guarantees,
 technical qualifications and information necessary for
 establishing the financial, commercial and technical
 capacity of suppliers, as well as the verification of
 whether a supplier meets those conditions, shall be
 limited to those that are essential to ensure the
 fulfillment of the contract in question;

     (c) the financial, commercial and technical capacity of a
 supplier shall be judged both on the basis of that
 supplier's global business activity and its activity, if
 any, in the territory of the Party of the procuring
 entity;

     (d) no entity may misuse the process of, including the time
 required for, qualification in order to exclude suppliers
 of any other Party from a suppliers' list or from being
 considered for a particular procurement;

     (e) an entity shall recognize as qualified suppliers those
 suppliers of any other Party that meet the conditions for
 participation in a particular procurement;

     (f) an entity shall consider for a particular procurement
 those suppliers of any other Party that request to
 participate in the procurement and that are not yet
 qualified, provided there is sufficient time to complete
 the qualification procedure;

     (g) an entity that maintains a permanent list of qualified
 suppliers shall ensure that suppliers may apply for
 qualification at any time, that all qualified suppliers
 so requesting are included in the list within a
 reasonably short period of time and that all qualified
 suppliers included in the list are notified of the
 termination of any such list or of their removal from it;

     (h) if, after publication of a notice in accordance with
 Article 1010 (Invitation to Participate), a supplier that
 is not yet qualified requests to participate in a
 particular procurement, the entity shall promptly start
 the qualification procedure;

     (i) an entity shall advise any supplier that requests to
 become a qualified supplier of its decision as to whether
 that supplier has become qualified; and

     (j) where an entity rejects a supplier's application to
 qualify or ceases to recognize a supplier as qualified,
 the entity shall, upon request of the supplier, promptly
 provide pertinent information concerning the entity's
 reasons for doing so.

3.   Each Party shall:

     (a) ensure that each of its entities uses a single
 qualification procedure, except that an entity may use
 additional qualification procedures where the entity
 determines the need for a different procedure and is
 prepared, upon request of any other Party, to demonstrate
 such need; and

     (b) make efforts to minimize differences in the qualification
 procedures of its entities.

4.   Nothing in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall prevent an entity from
excluding any supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy or false
declarations.


Article 1010: Invitation to Participate

1.   An entity shall, in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 5,
publish an invitation to participate for all procurements, except
as otherwise provided for in Article 1016 (Limited Tendering), in
the appropriate publication listed in Annex 1010.1 (Publications).

2.   The invitation to participate shall take the form of a notice

     (a) a description of the nature and quantity of the goods or
 services to be procured, including any options for
 further procurement and, if possible 

     (i) an estimate of the timing when such options may be
 exercised, and 

     (ii) in the case of recurring contracts, an estimate of
 the timing of the subsequent tender notices for the
 goods or services to be procured;

     (b) a statement as to whether the procedure is open or
 selective and whether it will involve negotiation;

     (c) any date for starting delivery, or completion of
 delivery, of goods or services to be procured;

 tender or to qualify for the suppliers' lists must be
 submitted, the final date for receiving such an
 application and the language or languages in which it may
 be submitted;

     (e) the address to which tenders must be submitted, the final
 date for receiving tenders and the language or languages
 in which tenders may be submitted;

     (f) the address of the entity that will award the contract
 and that will provide any information necessary for

3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, any entity listed in Annex 1002.2
(State and Provincial Government Entities) or Annex 1002.3
(Government Enterprises) may use, as an invitation to participate,
a notice of planned procurement, which shall contain as much of the
information referred to in paragraph 2 as is available to the
entity but which shall include, at a minimum, the following
information: 

     (a) a description of the subject matter of the procurement;

invitation to participate shall subsequently invite suppliers that
have expressed an interest in the procurement to confirm their
interest on the basis of information provided by the entity, which
information shall include at least the information referred to in
paragraph 2.

5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, any entity listed in Annex 1002.2
(State and Provincial Government Entities) or Annex 1002.3
(Government Enterprises) may use, as an invitation to participate,
a notice regarding a qualification system.  Any entity that uses
such a notice shall, subject to the considerations referred to
Article 1015 (8) (Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and
Awarding of Contracts), provide in a timely manner information that
allows all suppliers that have expressed an interest in
participating in the procurement to have a meaningful opportunity
to assess their interest. The information shall normally include
the information contained in the notices referred to in paragraph
2. Information provided to one interested supplier shall be
provided in a non-discriminatory manner to all other interested
suppliers.

6.   In the case of selective tendering procedures, any entity that
maintains a permanent list of qualified suppliers shall publish
annually in one of the publications listed in Annex 1010.1
(Publications) a notice containing the following information:

     (a) an enumeration of any lists maintained, including their
 headings, in relation to the goods or services or
 categories of goods or services to be procured through
 the lists;

     (b) the conditions to be fulfilled by suppliers in view of
 their inscription on the lists referred to in
 subparagraph (a) and the methods according to which each
 of those conditions will be verified by the entity
 concerned; and

     (c) the period of validity of the lists and the formalities
 for their renewal.

7.   If, after publication of an invitation to participate, but
before the time set for the opening or receipt of tenders as
specified in the notices or the tender documentation, an entity
finds that it has become necessary to amend or reissue the notice
or tender documentation, the entity shall ensure that the amended
or reissued notice or tender documentation is given the same
circulation as the original. Any significant information given by
an entity to one supplier with respect to a particular procurement
shall be given simultaneously to all other suppliers concerned and
sufficiently in advance so as to provide all suppliers concerned
adequate time to consider such information and to respond to it.

8.   An entity shall indicate, in the notices referred to in this
Article or in the publication in which the notices appear, that the
procurement is covered by this Chapter.


Article 1011: Selective Tendering Procedures

1.   To ensure optimum effective competition between the suppliers
of all Parties under selective tendering procedures, an entity of
a Party shall, for each procurement, invite tenders from the
maximum number of domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other
Parties, consistent with the efficient operation of the procurement
system.

2.   Subject to paragraph 3, any entity that maintains a permanent
list of qualified suppliers may select suppliers to be invited to
tender for a particular procurement from among those listed. In the
process of making any selection, the entity shall provide for
equitable opportunities for suppliers on the list.

3.   Subject to Article 1009 (2)(f) (Qualification of Suppliers),
an entity shall allow any supplier that requests to participate in
a particular procurement to submit a tender and shall consider the
tender. The number of additional suppliers permitted to participate
shall be limited only by the efficient operation of the procurement
system.

4.   If an entity does not invite or admit a supplier to tender,
the entity shall, upon request of the supplier, promptly provide
pertinent information concerning its reasons for not doing so.


Article 1012: Time Limits for Tendering and Delivery

1.   An entity of a Party shall:

     (a) in prescribing any time limit, provide adequate time to
 allow suppliers of the other Parties to prepare and
 submit tenders before the closing of the tendering
 procedures;

     (b) in determining any time limit, consistent with its own
 reasonable needs, take into account such factors as the
 complexity of the procurement, the extent of
 subcontracting anticipated, and the time normally
 required for transmitting tenders by mail from foreign as
 well as domestic points; and

     (c) take due account of publication delays when setting the
 final date for receipt of tenders or applications to be
 invited to tender.

2.   Subject to paragraph 3, an entity shall provide that:

     (a) in open procedures, the period for the receipt of tenders
 is no less than 40 days from the date of publication of
 the notice referred to in Article 1010 (Invitation to
 Participate);

     (b) in selective procedures not involving the use of a
 permanent list of qualified suppliers, the period for
 submitting an application to be invited to tender is no
 less than 25 days from the date of publication of the
 notice referred to in Article 1010 (Invitation to
 Participate), and the period for receipt of tenders is no
 less than 40 days from the date of issuance of the
 invitation to tender; and

     (c) in selective procedures involving the use of a permanent
 list of qualified suppliers, the period for receipt of
 tenders is no less than 40 days from the date of the
 initial issuance of invitations to tender. If the date of
 initial issuance of invitations to tender does not
 coincide with the date of publication of the notice
 referred to in Article 1010 (Invitation to Participate),
 there shall not be less than 40 days between those two
 dates.

3.   An entity may reduce the periods referred to in paragraph 2 in
accordance with the following:

     (a) where a notice referred to Article 1010 (3) or (5)
 (Invitation to Participate) has been published for a
 period of no less than 40 days and no more than 12
 months, the 40 day limit for receipt of tenders may be
 reduced to no less than 24 days;

     (b) in the case of the second or subsequent publications
 dealing with recurring contracts within the meaning of
 Article 1010 (2) (Invitation to Participate), the 40 day
 limit for receipt of tenders may be reduced to no less
 than 24 days;

     (c) where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the entity
 renders impracticable the periods in question, the
 periods may be reduced to no less than 10 days from the
 date of publication of the notice referred to in Article
 1010 (Invitation to Participate); or

     (d) where an entity listed in Annex 1002.2 (State and
 Provincial Government Entities) or Annex 1002.3
 (Government Enterprises) is using as an invitation to
 participate a notice referred to in of Article 1010 (5)
 (Invitation to Participate), the periods may be fixed by
 mutual agreement between the entity and all selected
 suppliers; but in the absence of agreement, the entity
 may fix periods which shall be sufficiently long to
 enable responsive bidding and shall not be less than 10
 days.

4.   An entity shall, in establishing any delivery date for goods
or services and consistent with its own reasonable needs, take into
account such factors as the complexity of the procurement, the
extent of subcontracting anticipated and the time realistically
required for production, destocking and transport of goods from the
points of supply.


Article 1013: Tender Documentation

1.   Where an entity provides tender documentation to suppliers,
the documentation shall contain all information necessary to permit
suppliers to submit responsive tenders, including information
required to be published in the notice of procurement, except for
Article 1010 (2)(h) (Invitation to Participate). It must also
include the following information:

     (a) the address of the entity to which tenders should be
 sent;

     (b) the address where requests for supplementary information
 should be sent;

     (c) the language or languages in which tenders and tendering
 documents may be submitted;

     (d) the closing date and time for receipt of tenders and the
 length of time during which any tender should be open for
 acceptance;

     (e) the persons authorized to be present at the opening of
 tenders and the date, time and place of the opening;

     (f) a statement of any economic and technical requirement to
 be met and of any financial guarantee, information and
 documents required from suppliers;

     (g) a complete description of the goods or services required
 and any requirements to be fulfilled, including technical
 specifications, conformity certification and necessary
 plans, drawings and instructional materials;

     (h) the criteria for awarding the contract, including any
 factors other than price that are to be considered in the
 evaluation of tenders and the cost elements to be
 included in evaluating tender prices, such as transport,
 insurance and inspection costs, and in the case of goods
 or services of any other Party, customs duties and other
 import charges, taxes and currency of payment;

     (i) the terms of payment; and

     (j) any other terms or conditions.

2.   An entity shall:

     (a) forward tender documentation at the request of any
 supplier that is participating in open procedures or has
 requested to participate in selective procedures, and
 reply promptly to any reasonable request for explanations
 relating thereto; and

     (b) reply promptly to any reasonable request for relevant
 information made by a supplier participating in the
 tendering procedure, on condition that such information
 does not give that supplier an advantage over its
 competitors in the procedure for the award of the
 contract.


Article 1014: Negotiation Disciplines

1.   An entity may conduct negotiations:

     (a) in the context of procurements in which the entity has,
 in the notice referred to in Article 1010 (Invitation to
 Participate), indicated its intent to negotiate; or

     (b) when it appears from the evaluation of the tenders that
 no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms
 of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the
 notices or tender documentation.

2.   Negotiations shall be used primarily to identify the strengths
and weaknesses in the tenders.

3.   An entity shall treat all tenders in confidence. In
particular, an entity may not provide to any person information
intended to assist any supplier to bring its tender up to the level
of any other tender.

4.   An entity may not, in the course of negotiations, discriminate
between different suppliers. In particular, an entity shall:

     (a) carry out any elimination of suppliers in accordance with
 the criteria set forth in the notices and tender
 documentation;

     (b) provide in writing all modifications to the criteria or
 to the technical requirements to all suppliers remaining
 in the negotiations;

     (c) permit all remaining suppliers to submit new or amended
 tenders on the basis of the revised criteria or
 requirements; and

     (d) when negotiations are concluded, permit all remaining
 suppliers to submit final tenders in accordance with a
 common deadline.


Article 1015: Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and
 Awarding of Contracts

1.   An entity shall use procedures for the submission, receipt and
opening of tenders and the awarding of contracts that are
consistent with the following:

     (a) tenders shall normally be submitted in writing directly
 or by mail;

     (b) if tenders by telex, telegram, telecopy or other means of
 electronic transmission are permitted, the tender made
 thereby must include all the information necessary for
 the evaluation of the tender, in particular the
 definitive price proposed by the supplier and a statement
 that the supplier agrees to all the terms, conditions and
 provisions of the invitation to tender;

     (c) a tender made by telex, telegram, telecopy or other means
 of electronic transmission must be confirmed promptly by
 letter or by the dispatch of a signed copy of the telex,
 telegram, telecopy or electronic message;

     (d) the content of the telex, telegram, telecopy or
 electronic message shall prevail where there is a
 difference or conflict between that content and the
 content of any documentation received after the time
 limit for submission of tenders; 

     (e) tenders presented by telephone shall not be permitted;

     (f) requests to participate in selective tendering procedures
 may be submitted by telex, telegram or telecopy and if
 permitted, may be submitted by other means of electronic
 transmission; and

     (g) the opportunities that may be given to suppliers to
 correct unintentional errors of form between the opening
 of tenders and the awarding of the contract shall not be
 permitted to give rise to any discriminatory practice.

In this paragraph, "means of electronic transmission" consists of
means capable of producing for the recipient at the destination of
the transmission a printed copy of the tender.

2.   An entity may not penalize a supplier whose tender is received
in the office designated in the tender documentation after the time
specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely to
mishandling on the part of the entity. An entity may also consider,
in exceptional circumstances, tenders received after the time
specified for receiving tenders if the entity's procedures so
provide.

3.   All tenders solicited by an entity under open or selective
procedures shall be received and opened under procedures and
conditions guaranteeing the regularity of the openings. The entity
shall retain the information on the opening of tenders and the
information shall remain at the disposal of the competent
authorities of the respective Party so that it may be used if
required under the procedures of Article 1017 (Bid Challenge),
Article 1019 (Provision of Information) or Chapter Twenty
(Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures).

4.   An entity shall award contracts in accordance with the
following:

     (a) to be considered for award, a tender must, at the time of
 opening, conform to the essential requirements of the
 notices or tender documentation and have been submitted
 by a supplier that complies with the conditions for
 participation;

     (b) if the entity has received a tender that is abnormally
 lower in price than other tenders submitted, the entity
 may enquire of the supplier to ensure that it can comply
 with the conditions of participation and is or will be
 capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract;

     (c) unless the entity decides in the public interest not to
 award the contract, the entity shall make the award to
 the supplier that has been determined to be fully capable
 of undertaking the contract and whose tender is either
 the lowest tender or the tender that in terms of the
 specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or
 tender documentation is determined to be the most
 advantageous;

     (d) awards shall be made in accordance with the criteria and
 essential requirements specified in the tender
 documentation; and

     (e) option clauses shall not be used in a manner that
 circumvents the provisions of this Chapter.

5.   No entity of a Party shall make it a condition of the awarding
of a contract that the supplier has previously been awarded one or
more contracts by an entity of that Party, or that the supplier has
prior work experience within the territory of that Party.

6.   An entity shall:

     (a) upon request, promptly inform suppliers participating in
 tendering procedures of decisions on contract awards and,
 if so requested, inform them in writing; and

     (b) upon request of a supplier whose tender was not selected
 for award, provide pertinent information to that supplier
 concerning the reasons for not selecting its tender and
 the characteristics and relevant advantages of the tender
 selected, as well as the name of the winning supplier.

7.   An entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate
publication listed in Annex 1010.1 (Publications) no later than 72
days after the award of a contract, which notice shall contain the
following information:

     (a) a description of the nature and quantity of goods or
 services included in the contract;

     (b) the name and address of the entity awarding the contract;

     (c) the date of the award;

     (d) the name and address of each winning supplier;

     (e) the value of the contract, or the highest and lowest
 tenders considered in the process of awarding the
 contract; and

     (f) the tendering procedure used.

8.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, an entity
may withhold certain information on the award of a contract, where
disclosure of such information would impede law enforcement or
otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the
legitimate commercial interest of a particular person, or might
prejudice fair competition between suppliers.


Article 1016: Limited Tendering

1.   An entity of a Party may, in the circumstances and subject to
the conditions specified in paragraph 2, deviate from the
provisions of Articles 1008 (Tendering Procedures) through 1015
(Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and Awarding of
Contracts), provided that such limited tendering is not used with
a view to avoiding maximum possible competition or in a manner that
would constitute a means of discrimination between suppliers of the
other Parties or protection of domestic suppliers.

2.   An entity may use limited tendering in the following
circumstances and subject to the following conditions, as
applicable:

     (a) in the absence of tenders in response to an open or
 selective tender, or when the tenders submitted either
 have resulted from collusion or do not conform to the
 essential requirements of the tender documentation, or
 when the tenders submitted come from suppliers who do not
 comply with the conditions for participation provided for
 in accordance with this Chapter, on condition that the
 requirements of the initial procurement are not
 substantially modified in the contract as awarded;

     (b) when, for works of art or for reasons connected with the
 protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive
 rights, proprietary information, confidential consulting
 services or, when there is an absence of competition for
 technical reasons, the goods or services can be supplied
 only by a particular supplier and no reasonable
 alternative or substitute exists;

     (c) in so far as is strictly necessary when, for reasons of
 extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by
 the entity, the goods or services could not be obtained
 in time by means of open or selective tendering
 procedures;

     (d) for additional deliveries by the original supplier that
 are intended either as replacement parts or continuing
 services for existing supplies, services or
 installations, or as the extension of existing supplies,
 services or installations, when a change of supplier
 would compel the entity to procure equipment or services
 not meeting requirements of interchangeability with
 already existing equipment or services, including
 software to the extent that the initial procurement of
 the software was covered by this Chapter;

     (e) when an entity procures a prototype or a first good or
 service that is developed at its request in the course
 of, and for, a particular contract for research,
 experiment, study or original development. When such
 contracts have been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of
 goods or services shall be subject to Articles 1008
 (Tendering Procedures) through 1015 (Submission, Receipt
 and Opening of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts).
 Original development of a first good may include limited
 production in order to incorporate the results of field
 testing and to demonstrate that the good is suitable for
 production in quantity to acceptable quality standards.
 It does not extend to quantity production to establish
 commercial viability or to recover research and
 development costs;

     (f) for goods purchased on a commodity market;

     (g) for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous
 conditions that only arise in the very short term. This
 provision is intended to cover unusual disposals by firms
 which are not normally suppliers; or disposal of assets
 of businesses in liquidation or receivership. It is not
 intended to cover routine purchases from regular
 suppliers; and

     (h) for a contract awarded to the winner of an architectural
 design contest, on condition that the contest

     (i) has been organized in a manner that is consistent
 with the principles of this Chapter, notably as
 regards the publication, in the sense of Article
 1010 (Invitation to Participate), of an invitation
 to suitably qualified suppliers to participate in
 the contest,

     (ii) has been organized with a view to awarding the
 design contract to the winner, and 

     (iii) is to be judged by an independent jury. 

3.   An entity shall prepare a report in writing on each contract
awarded by it under the provisions of paragraph 2. Each report
shall contain the name of the procuring entity, indicate the value
and kind of goods or services procured, the name of the country of
origin, and a statement indicating the circumstances and conditions
described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of limited
tendering. Each report shall remain with the entity concerned at
the disposal of the competent authorities of the respective Party,
so that it may be used if required under the procedures of Article
1017 (Bid Challenge), Article 1019 (Provision of Information) or
Chapter 20 (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures).


Article 1017: Bid Challenge

1.   In order to promote fair, open and impartial procurement
procedures, each Party shall adopt and maintain bid challenge
procedures for procurements covered by this Chapter in accordance
with the following:

     (a) each Party shall allow suppliers of any good or service
 of another Party to submit bid challenges concerning any
 aspect of the procurement process, which for purposes of
 this Article begins after an entity has decided on its
 procurement requirement, leading up to and including the
 contract award;

     (b) a Party may encourage a supplier to seek a resolution of
 any complaint with the entity concerned prior to
 initiating a bid challenge;

     (c) each Party shall ensure that its entities accord fair and
 timely consideration to any complaint regarding
 procurement covered by this Chapter;

     (d) whether or not a supplier has attempted to resolve its
 complaint with the entity, or upon an unsuccessful
 attempt at such a resolution, no Party shall prevent the
 supplier from initiating a bid challenge or seeking any
 other relief available to such supplier;

     (e) a Party may require a supplier to notify the entity upon
 initiation of a bid challenge;

     (f) a Party may limit the period within which a supplier may
 initiate a bid challenge, but in no case shall the period
 be less than 10 working days from the time when the basis
 of the complaint became known, or reasonably should have
 become known, to the supplier;

     (g) each Party shall establish or designate a reviewing
 authority with no substantial interest in the outcome of
 procurements to receive bid challenges and make findings
 and recommendations concerning them;

     (h) upon receipt of a bid challenge, the reviewing authority
 shall expeditiously investigate the challenge, and may be
 required to limit its considerations to the challenge
 itself;

     (i) in investigating the challenge, the reviewing authority
 may delay the awarding of the proposed contract pending
 resolution of the challenge, except in cases of urgency
 or where such a delay would be contrary to the public
 interest;

     (j) the reviewing authority shall issue a recommendation to
 resolve the challenge, which may include directing the
 entity to reevaluate offers, terminate or re-compete the
 contract in question;

     (k) entities normally shall follow the recommendations of the
 reviewing authority;

     (l) each Party should authorize its reviewing authority,
 following the conclusion of a bid challenge, to make
 additional recommendations in writing to an entity
 respecting any facet of the entity's procurement process
 that is identified as problematic during the
 investigation of the challenge, including recommendations
 for changes in the procurement procedures of the entity
 to bring them into conformity with the obligations of
 this Chapter;

     (m) the reviewing authority shall provide its findings and
 recommendations respecting bid challenges in writing and
 in a timely manner, and shall make them available to the
 Parties and all interested persons;

     (n) each Party shall specify in writing and shall make
 generally available all its bid challenge procedures; and

     (o) each Party shall ensure that each of its entities
 maintains complete documentation concerning each of its
 procurements, including a written record of all
 communications substantially affecting each procurement,
 for at least three years from the date the contract was
 awarded, to allow verification that the procurement
 process was carried out in accordance with the
 obligations of this Chapter.

2.   A Party may require that a bid challenge be initiated only
after the notice of procurement has been published or, where a
notice is not published, after tender documentation has been made
available. If a Party imposes such a requirement, the 10 working
day period described in paragraph 1(f) shall begin not earlier than
the date that the notice is published or the tender documentation
is made available.


Article 1018: Exceptions

1.   Notwithstanding Article 2102 (National Security), for purposes
of this Chapter nothing shall be construed to prevent a Party from
taking any action or not disclosing any information which it
considers necessary for the protection of its essential security
interests relating to the procurement of arms, ammunition or war
materials, or to procurement indispensable for national security or
for national defense purposes.

2.   Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner that
would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between Parties where the same conditions prevail or
a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties, nothing in
this Chapter shall be construed to prevent any Party from adopting
or maintaining measures:

     (a) necessary to protect public morals, order or safety;

     (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or
 health;

     (c) necessary to protect intellectual property; or 

     (d) relating to goods or services of handicapped persons, of
 philanthropic institutions or of prison labor.


Article 1019: Provision of Information

1.   Each Party shall promptly publish any law, regulation,
precedential judicial decision, administrative ruling of general
application and any procedure, including standard contract clauses,
regarding government procurement covered by this Chapter in the
appropriate publications listed in Annex 1010.1 (Publications).

2.   Each Party shall:

     (a) be prepared, upon request, to explain to any other Party
 its government procurement procedures; and

     (b) ensure that its entities, upon request from a supplier,
 promptly explain their procurement practices and
 procedures.

3.   A Party may seek such additional information on the award of
the contract as may be necessary to determine whether the
procurement was made fairly and impartially, in particular with
respect to unsuccessful tenders and further to Article 1015(6)
(Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and Awarding
Contracts). To this end, the Party of the procuring entity shall
provide information on both the characteristics and relative
advantages of the winning tender and the contract price. In cases
where release of this information would prejudice competition in
future tenders, the information shall not be released except after
consultation with and agreement of the Party which gave the
information to the requesting Party.

4.   Each Party shall provide, upon request, to any other Party,
information available to that Party and its entities concerning
covered procurement of its entities and the individual contracts
awarded by its entities.

5.   No Party shall disclose confidential information the
disclosure of which would prejudice the legitimate commercial
interests of a particular person or might prejudice fair
competition between suppliers, without the formal authorization of
the person that provided the information to that Party.

6.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring any
Party to disclose confidential information the disclosure of which
would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public
interest.

7.   With a view to ensuring effective monitoring of procurement
covered by this Chapter, each Party shall collect statistics and
provide to the other Parties each year an annual report in
accordance with the following reporting requirements, unless the
Parties unanimously agree to modify such requirements:

     (a) statistics on the estimated value of all contracts
 awarded, both above and below the applicable threshold
 values, broken down by entities;

     (b) statistics on the number and total value of contracts
 covered by this Chapter above the applicable threshold
 values, broken down by entities, categories of goods or
 services according to uniform classification systems to
 be determined by the Parties, and country of origin of
 the contract;

     (c) statistics, broken down by entities, and by categories of
 goods or services, on the number and total value of
 contracts awarded under each use of the procedures
 described in Article 1016 (Limited Tendering), and
 country of origin of the contract; and

     (d) statistics, broken down by entities, on the number and
 total value of contracts awarded under derogations to the
 Chapter listed in the appropriate annexes.

8.   With respect to the reports described in paragraph 7 that
pertain to entities listed in Annex 1002.2 (State and Provincial
Government Entities), each Party may organize such reports by state
or province.

9.   Each Party shall give favorable consideration, where
appropriate, to a request from any other Party for the exchange of
additional information on a reciprocal basis.

10.  The Parties shall undertake and complete by the date of entry
into force of this Agreement further technical work to make
available the complete goods and services classification list to be
used by their entities in procuring goods and services under this
Chapter and develop concordances between each of these systems,
and, if necessary, the agreed uniform system.

increase understanding of their respective government procurement
systems, with a view to maximizing access to government procurement
opportunities for the suppliers of all Parties.

2.   Each Party shall provide to the other Parties and to the
suppliers of such Parties, on a cost recovery basis, information
concerning training and orientation programs regarding its
government procurement system, and access on a non-discriminatory
basis to such programs as it conducts.

3.   The training and orientation programs referred to in paragraph
2 include:

     (a) training of personnel directly involved in government
 procurement procedures;

     (b) training of suppliers interested in pursuing government
 procurement opportunities;

     (c) explanation and description of specific elements of each
 Party's government procurement system, such as the bid
 challenge mechanism; and

     (d) information about government procurement market
 opportunities.

4.   Each Party shall establish at least one contact point to
provide the information regarding the training and orientation
programs pertaining to its government procurement system.


Article 1021: Joint Programs for Small Business 

1.   The Parties shall establish, within 12 months after the date
of entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee on Small
Business comprising representatives of the Parties. The Committee
shall meet as mutually agreed, but no less than once a year, and
shall report annually to the Commission on the efforts of the
Parties to promote government procurement opportunities for their
small businesses.

2.   The Committee shall work to facilitate the following
activities of the Parties:

     (a) identification of available opportunities for the
 training of small business personnel in their government
 procurement procedures;

     (b) identification of small businesses interested in becoming
 trading partners of small businesses in the territory of
 any other Party;

     (c) development of data bases of small businesses in the
 territory of each Party for use by entities of any other
 Party wishing to procure from small businesses; 

     (d) consultations regarding the factors that each Party uses

Article 1022: Rectifications or Modifications

1.   A Party may make modifications to its coverage under this
Chapter only in exceptional circumstances. 

2.   Where a Party makes modifications to its coverage under this
Chapter, the Party shall:

     (a) notify the other Parties and its Section of the
 Secretariat of the modification;

     (b) reflect the change in its schedule of the appropriate
 Annex; and

     (c) propose to the other Parties appropriate compensatory
 adjustments to its coverage in order to maintain a
 comparable level of coverage as existed prior to the
 modification.

The other Parties shall consider whether any proposed adjustment
made pursuant to subparagraph (c) is adequate to maintain a
comparable level of the mutually agreed coverage under this
Chapter. Where any Party does not agree that the proposed
adjustment is sufficient, it may have recourse to dispute
settlement procedures under Chapter Twenty (Institutional
Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures).

3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may make
rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor amendments to
its Annexes 1002.1 through 1002.7, provided that it notifies such
rectifications to the other Parties and its Section of the
Secretariat, and any other Party does not object to such proposed
rectification within 30 days. In such cases, subparagraph 2(c)
shall not apply. If a Party does object that the proposed
rectification would result in a substantive change in the balance
of coverage under this Chapter, it may have recourse to dispute
settlement procedures under Chapter Twenty (Institutional
Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures).

4.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party
may undertake legitimate reorganizations of its government
procurement entities covered by this Chapter, including programs
through which the procurement of such entities is decentralized or
the corresponding government functions cease to be performed by any
government entity, whether or not subject to this Chapter. In such
cases, subparagraph 2(c) shall not apply. No Party shall undertake
such reorganizations or programs to avoid the obligations of this
Chapter. If a Party objects to the withdrawal on the grounds that
the functions continue to be performed by a government entity, that
Party may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under
Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement
Procedures).


Article 1023: Divestiture of Entities

1.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party
from divesting an entity subject to the obligations of this
Chapter.

2.   If, upon the public offering of shares of an entity listed in
Annex 1002.3 (Government Enterprises), or through other methods,
such entity is no longer subject to federal government control, the
respective Party may delete the entity from Annex 1002.3
(Government Enterprises), and withdraw the entity from the
obligations of the Chapter, upon notification to the other Parties.

3.   If a Party objects to the withdrawal on the grounds that the
entity remains subject to federal government control, that Party
may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Chapter
Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures).


Article 1024: Further Negotiations

1.   The Parties shall commence further negotiations no later than
December 31, 1998, with a view towards the substantial
liberalization of their respective procurement markets. The Parties
recognize that such liberalization would ensure more competitive
opportunities for all suppliers of the Parties in their respective
procurement markets. 

2.   The Parties will review all features of government procurement
practices for the purposes of:

     (a) assessing the workings of the procurement system;

     (b) seeking to expand the coverage of this Chapter;

     (c) including within the obligations of this Chapter

     (i) government enterprises, and

     (ii) legislated and administrative exceptions; and

     (d) reviewing thresholds.

3.   Prior to the review specified in paragraph 2, the Parties will
endeavor to consult with their state and provincial governments
with a view to obtaining commitments, on a voluntary and reciprocal
basis, to include within the obligations of this Chapter
procurement by state and provincial government entities and
enterprises.

4.   If the negotiations pursuant to Article 96B of the GATT
Agreement on Government Procurement (the Code) are completed prior
to the new review specified in paragraph 2, the Parties shall:

     (a) immediately begin consultations with their state and
 provincial governments with a view to obtaining
 commitments, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis, to
 include within the obligations of this Chapter
 procurement by state and provincial government entities
 and enterprises; and

     (b) increase the obligations and coverage of this Chapter to
 a level at least commensurate with that of the Code.

5.   The Parties shall undertake further negotiations no later than
December 31, 1998, on the subject of electronic transmission of
tender information with a view to exploring the feasibility of
amending this Chapter to permit electronic transmission as an
additional or alternate means of publication.

paragraph 1 will decrease according to the following schedule:

     1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 
                    50% 45% 45% 40% 40%

eliminated after 8 years from the date of entry into force of this
Agreement. Procurement of biologicals and patented drugs shall not
be exempted under any other provision of the Annexes of this

which will impair the protection provided by Chapter 17
(Intellectual Property) of this Agreement.

with respect to the 40 day time limits. However, Mexico will fully
comply with such obligations as from January 1, 1995.

Provision of Information

8.   The Parties recognize that Mexico may be required to undertake
extensive retraining of personnel, introduce new data maintenance
and reporting systems and make major adjustments to the procurement
systems of certain entities in order to comply with the obligations
of this Chapter. The Parties also recognize that Mexico may
encounter difficulties in making the transition to procurement
systems that facilitate full compliance with the obligations of
this Chapter.

9.   The Parties shall, therefore, consult on an annual basis for
the first five years that the Agreement is in effect to review
transitional problems and to develop mutually agreed solutions.
Such solutions may include, when appropriate, temporary adjustment
to the obligations of Mexico under this Chapter, such as those
related to reporting requirements.

10.  In addition, the United States and Canada shall cooperate with
Mexico to provide technical assistance, as appropriate and mutually
agreed pursuant to Article 1020 (Technical Cooperation) of this
Chapter, to aid Mexico's transition.

11.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Annex, each Party
shall assume all of its obligations specified in this Chapter upon

                  Indexation and Conversion of Thresholds


1.   The calculations described in Article 1002(4) (Scope and
Coverage) shall be made in accordance with the following:

     (a) the United States inflation rate shall be measured by the
 the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods published by
 the United States Department of Commerce; and

     (b) the inflationary adjustment shall be estimated according
 to the following formula

     T0 x (1+ pi) = T1

     T0= threshold value at base period
     pi= accumulated U.S. inflation rate for the ith two
 year-period
     T1= new threshold value.

2.   Mexico and Canada shall calculate and convert the value of the
thresholds specified in paragraph 3 into their national currencies
using the conversion formulas set out in paragraph 3 or 4, as
appropriate.  Mexico and Canada shall notify each other and the
United States of the value, in their respective currencies, of the
newly calculated thresholds not less than one month before the
respective thresholds take effect.

3.   Canada shall base the calculation on the official conversion
rates of the Bank of Canada. From January 1, 1994 through December
31, 1995, the conversion rate shall be the average of the weekly
values of the Canadian dollars in terms of the U.S. dollars over
the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1993. For each
subsequent two-year period, beginning January 1, 1996, the
conversion rate shall be the average of the weekly values of the
Canadian dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar over the two-year
period ending September 30 of the year preceding the beginning of
each two-year period.

4.   Mexico shall use the conversion rate of the Banco de Mxico.
The conversion rate shall be the existing value of the Mexican peso
in terms of the US dollar as of December 1 and June 1 of each year,
or the 1st working day after. The conversion rate as of December 1
shall apply from January 1 to June 30 of the following year, and as
of June 1 shall apply from July 1 to December 31 of that year.

that is not inconsistent with this Chapter.

circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the
establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,

investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.

4.   For greater certainty, no Party shall:

     (a) impose on an investor of another Party a requirement

 than nominal qualifying shares for directors or
 incorporators of corporations; or

     (b) require an investor of another Party, by reason of its

requirement to locate production, provide a service, train or
employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or

investment.

1.   Each Party shall permit all transfers and international
payments ("transfers") relating to an investment of an investor
of another Party in the territory of the Party to be made freely
and without delay. Such transfers include:

     (a) profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty

 from the investment;

     (b) proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the

6.   A Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind only in
circumstances in which it could otherwise restrict such transfers
under this Agreement. 


Article 1110: Expropriation and Compensation

1.   No Party shall directly or indirectly nationalize or
expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its
territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or
expropriation of such an investment ("expropriation"), except:

     (a) for a public purpose;

     (b) on a non-discriminatory basis;

     (c) in accordance with due process of law and the general
 principles of treatment provided in Article 1105; and

     (d) upon payment of compensation in accordance with
 paragraphs 2 to 6.

2.   Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of
the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation
took place ("date of expropriation"), and shall not reflect any
change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had
become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going
concern value, asset value (including declared tax value of
tangible property) and other criteria, as appropriate to
determine fair market value.

3.   Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully
realizable.

4.   If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall
include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that
currency from the date of expropriation until the date of actual
payment thereof.

5.   If a Party elects to pay in a currency other than a G7
currency, the amount paid on the date of payment, if converted
into a G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on
that date, shall be no less than if the amount of compensation
owed on the date of expropriation had been converted into that G7
currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date,
and interest had accrued at a commercially reasonable rate for
that G7 currency from the date of expropriation until the date of
payment.

6.   Upon payment, compensation shall be freely transferable as
provided in Article 1109.

7.   This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory
licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or
the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property
rights to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation
or creation is consistent with Chapter Seventeen (Intellectual
Property).

8.   For purposes of this Article and for greater clarity, a non-
discriminatory measure of general application shall not be
considered a measure tantamount to an expropriation of a debt
security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the ground
that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to
default on the debt.


Article 1111: Special Formalities and Information Requirements

1.   Nothing in Article 1102 shall be construed to prevent a
Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes
special formalities in connection with the establishment of
investments by investors of another Party, such as a requirement
that investors be residents of the Party or that investments be
legally constituted under the laws and regulations of the Party,
provided that such formalities do not impair the substance of the
benefits of any of the provisions in this Chapter.

2.   Notwithstanding Articles 1102 and 1103, a Party may require,
from an investor of another Party or its investment, routine
business information, to be used solely for informational or
statistical purposes, concerning that investment in its
territory.  The Party shall protect such business information as
is confidential from disclosure that would prejudice the
investor's or the investment's competitive position.  Nothing in
this paragraph shall preclude a Party from otherwise obtaining or
disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good
faith application of its laws.


Article 1112: Relationship to Other Chapters

1.    In the event of any inconsistency between a provision of
this Chapter and a provision of another Chapter, the provision of
the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.

2.   A requirement by a Party that a service provider of another
Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a
condition of providing a service into its territory does not of
itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of that
cross-border service. This Chapter shall apply to that Party's
treatment of the posted bond or financial security.


Article 1113: Denial of Benefits

1.   Each Party reserves the right to deny to an investor of
another Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to
investments of such investor the benefits of this Chapter if
investors of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and:

     (a) the denying Party does not maintain diplomatic
 relations with the non-Party; or 
     (b) the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with
 respect to the non-Party that prohibit transactions
 with the enterprise or that would be violated or
 circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were
 accorded to the enterprise or to its investments.

2.   Subject to prior notification and consultation in accordance
with Articles 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information)
and 2006 (Consultations), respectively, each Party reserves the
right to deny to an investor of another Party that is an
enterprise of such Party and to investments of such investors the
benefits of this Chapter if investors of a non-Party own or
control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial
business activities in the territory of the Party under whose
laws it is constituted or organized.


Article 1114: Environmental Measures

1.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a
Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure,
otherwise consistent with this Chapter, that it considers
appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory
is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.

2.   The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage
investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental
measures.  Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise
derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such
measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition,
expansion, or retention in its territory of an investment of an
investor.  If a Party considers that another Party has offered
such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the
other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to
avoiding any such encouragement.

not disadvantage financial service providers of another Party in
their ability to provide financial services as compared with the
ability of domestic financial service providers in like
circumstances to provide financial services.

to make the decision within a reasonable time thereafter.

5.   Nothing in this Agreement requires a Party to disclose
information related to the affairs and accounts of individual

disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be
contrary to the public interest, or prejudice legitimate
commercial interests. 

6.   Each Party shall ensure that inquiry points exist, at the
latest 180 days after the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, to which all reasonable inquiries from interested
persons may be directed regarding any measures of general
application taken by that Party with respect to this Chapter.

5.   A Party establishing a numerical limit pursuant to paragraph

 other Party concerned, taking into account the demand
 for temporary entry under this Part;

     (b) shall not apply its procedures established pursuant to

 subject to the numerical limit, but may require such 
 business person to comply with its other procedures
 applicable to the temporary entry of professionals; and

     (c) may, in consultation with the other Party concerned,
 grant temporary entry under paragraph 1 to a business
 person who practices in a profession where
 accreditation, licensing, and certification
 requirements are mutually recognized by such Parties.

6.   Nothing in paragraphs 4 or 5 shall be construed so as to
limit the ability of a business person to seek temporary entry
under a Party's applicable immigration measures relating to the
entry of professionals other than those adopted or maintained
pursuant to paragraph 1.

7.   Three years after a Party establishes a numerical limit
pursuant to paragraph 4, it shall consult with the other Party
concerned with a view to determining a date after which the limit
shall cease to apply.

                               Schedule III


                         United States of America


1.   Commencing on the date of entry into force of this Agreement
as between the United States and Mexico, the United States shall
annually approve as many as 5,500 initial petitions of business
persons of Mexico seeking temporary entry under Section D of
Annex 1603 to engage in a business activity at a professional
level in a profession set out in Schedule II.

2.   For purposes of paragraph 1, the United States shall not
take into account:

     (a) the renewal of a period of temporary entry;

     (b) the entry of a spouse or children accompanying or
 following to join the principal business person;

     (c) an admission under Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the
 Immigration and Nationality Act, 1952, as amended,
 including the worldwide numerical limit established by
 Section 214(g)(1)(A) of such Act; or

     (d) an admission under any other provision of Section
 101(a)(15) of such Act relating to the entry of
 professionals.

3.   Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Section D of Annex 1603 shall apply as
between the United States and Mexico for no longer than:

     (a) the period that such paragraphs or similar provisions
 may apply as between the United States and any other
 Party or non-Party; or

     (b) 10 years after the date of entry into force of this
 Agreement as between such Parties,

whichever period is shorter.


                                 PART SIX
                           INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY


                            Chapter Seventeen 

                           Intellectual Property



Article 1701: Nature and Scope of Obligations

1.   Each Party shall provide in its territory to the nationals
of another Party adequate and effective protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights, while ensuring that
measures to enforce intellectual property rights do not
themselves become barriers to legitimate trade.

2.   To provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement
of intellectual property rights, each Party shall, at a minimum,
give effect to this Chapter and to the substantive provisions of:

     (a) the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Producers
 of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of their
 Phonograms, 1971 (Geneva Convention);

     (b) the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
 Artistic Works, 1971 (Berne Convention);

     (c) the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial
 Property, 1967 (Paris Convention); and

     (d) the International Convention for the Protection of New
 Varieties of Plants, 1978 (UPOV Convention), or the
 International Convention for the Protection of New
 Varieties of Plants, 1991 (UPOV Convention).

If a Party has not acceded to the specified text of any such
Conventions on or before the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, it shall make every effort to accede.

3.   Paragraph 2 shall apply, except as provided in Annex 1701.3.


Article 1702: More Extensive Protection

     A Party may implement in its domestic law more extensive
protection of intellectual property rights than is required under
this Agreement, provided that such protection is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.


Article 1703: National Treatment

1.   Each Party shall accord to nationals of another Party
treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own
nationals with regard to the protection and enforcement of all
intellectual property rights.  In respect of sound recordings,
each Party shall provide such treatment to producers and
performers of another Party, except that a Party may limit rights
of performers of another Party in respect of secondary uses of
sound recordings to those rights its nationals are accorded in
the territory of such other Party.

2.   No Party may, as a condition of according national treatment
under this Article, require right holders to comply with any
formalities or conditions in order to acquire rights in respect
of copyright and related rights.

3.   A Party may derogate from paragraph 1 in relation to its
judicial and administrative procedures for the protection or
enforcement of intellectual property rights, including any
procedure requiring a national of another Party to designate for
service of process an address in the Party's territory or to
appoint an agent in the Party's territory, if the derogation is
consistent with the relevant Convention listed in Article
1701(2), provided that such derogation:

     (a) is necessary to secure compliance with measures that
 are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and

     (b) is not applied in a manner that would constitute a
 disguised restriction on trade.

4.   No Party shall have any obligation under this Article with
respect to procedures provided in multilateral agreements
concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property
Organization relating to the acquisition or maintenance of
intellectual property rights.


Article 1704: Control of Abusive or Anticompetitive Practices or
 Conditions

     Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from
specifying in its domestic law licensing practices or conditions
that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of intellectual
property rights having an adverse effect on competition in the
relevant market.  A Party may adopt or maintain, consistent with
the other provisions of this Agreement, appropriate measures to
prevent or control such practices or conditions.


Article 1705: Copyright

1.   Each Party shall protect the works covered by Article 2 of
the Berne Convention, including any other works that embody
original expression within the meaning of that Convention.  In
particular: 

     (a) all types of computer programs are literary works
 within the meaning of the Berne Convention and each
 Party shall protect them as such; and

     (b) compilations of data or other material, whether in
 machine readable or other form, which by reason of the
 selection or arrangement of their contents constitute
 intellectual creations, shall be protected as such.

The protection a Party provides under subparagraph (b) shall not
extend to the data or material itself, or prejudice any copyright
subsisting in that data or material.

2.   Each Party shall provide to authors and their successors in
interest those rights enumerated in the Berne Convention in
respect of works covered by paragraph 1, including the right to
authorize or prohibit:

     (a) the importation into the Party's territory of copies of
 the work made without the right holder's authorization;

     (b) the first public distribution of the original and each
 copy of the work by sale, rental or otherwise;

     (c) the communication of a work to the public; and

     (d) the commercial rental of the original or a copy of a
 computer program.

Subparagraph (d) shall not apply where the copy of the computer
program is not itself an essential object of the rental.  Each
Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of a
computer program on the market with the right holder's consent
shall not exhaust the rental right.

3.   Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related
rights:

     (a) any person acquiring or holding economic rights may
 freely and separately transfer such rights by contract
 for purposes of their exploitation and enjoyment by the
 transferee; and

     (b) any person acquiring or holding such economic rights by
 virtue of a contract, including contracts of employment
 underlying the creation of works and sound recordings,
 shall be able to exercise those rights in its own name
 and enjoy fully the benefits derived from those rights.

4.   Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection
of a work, other than a photographic work or a work of applied
art, is to be calculated on a basis other than the life of a
natural person, the term shall be not less than 50 years from the
end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of
the work, or, failing such authorized publication within 50 years
from the making of the work, 50 years from the end of the
calendar year of making.

5.   Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the
rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases that
do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right
holder.

6.   No Party may grant translation and reproduction licenses
permitted under the Appendix to the Berne Convention where
legitimate needs in that Party's territory for copies or
translations of the work could be met by the right holder's
voluntary actions but for obstacles created by the Party's
measures. 

7.   Each Party shall comply with the requirements set out in
Annex 1705.7.


Article 1706: Sound Recordings

1.   Each Party shall provide to the producer of a sound
recording the right to authorize or prohibit:

     (a) the direct or indirect reproduction of the sound
 recording;

     (b) the importation into the Party's territory of copies of
 the sound recording made without the producer's
 authorization;

     (c) the first public distribution of the original and each
 copy of the sound recording by sale, rental or
 otherwise; and

     (d) the commercial rental of the original or a copy of the
 sound recording, except where expressly otherwise
 provided in a contract between the producer of the
 sound recording and the authors of the works fixed
 therein.

Each Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of a
sound recording on the market with the right holder's consent
shall not exhaust the rental right.

2.   Each Party shall provide a term of protection for sound
recordings of at least 50 years from the end of the calendar year
in which the fixation was made.

3.   Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the
rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases that
do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the sound recording
and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
right holder.


Article 1707: Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite
 Signals

     Within one year from the date of entry into force of this
Agreement, each Party shall:

     (a) make it a criminal offense to manufacture, import,
 sell, lease or otherwise make available a device or
 system that is primarily of assistance in decoding an
 encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without the
 authorization of the lawful distributor of such signal;
 and

     (b) make it a civil offense to receive, in connection with
 commercial activities, or further distribute, an
 encrypted program-carrying satellite signal that has
 been decoded without the authorization of the lawful
 distributor of the signal or to engage in any activity
 prohibited under subparagraph (a).

Each Party shall provide that any civil offense established under
subparagraph (b) shall be actionable by any person that holds an
interest in the content of such signal.


Article 1708: Trademarks

1.   For purposes of this Agreement, a trademark consists of any
sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing the
goods or services of one person from those of another, including
personal names, designs, letters, numerals, colors, figurative
elements, or the shape of goods or of their packaging. 
Trademarks shall include service marks and collective marks, and
may include certification marks.  A Party may require, as a
condition for registration that a sign be visually perceptible.

2.   Each Party shall provide to the owner of a registered
trademark the right to prevent all persons not having the owner's
consent from using in commerce identical or similar signs for
goods or services that are identical or similar to those goods or
services in respect of which the owner's trademark is registered,
where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion.  In the
case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or
services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.  The
rights described above shall not prejudice any prior rights, nor
shall they affect the possibility of a Party making rights
available on the basis of use.

3.   A Party may make registrability depend on use.  However,
actual use of a trademark shall not be a condition for filing an
application for registration.  No Party may refuse an application
solely on the ground that intended use has not taken place before
the expiry of a period of three years from the date of
application for registration.

4.   Each Party shall provide a system for the registration of
trademarks, which shall include:

     (a) examination of applications;

     (b) notice to be given to an applicant of the reasons for
 the refusal to register a trademark;

     (c) a reasonable opportunity for the applicant to respond
 to the notice;

     (d) publication of each trademark either before or promptly
 after it is registered; and

     (e) a reasonable opportunity for interested persons to
 petition to cancel the registration of a trademark.

A Party may provide for a reasonable opportunity for interested
persons to oppose the registration of a trademark.

5.   The nature of the goods or services to which a trademark is
to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to the
registration of the trademark.

6.   Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, with such
modifications as are necessary, to services.  In determining
whether a trademark is well-known, account shall be taken of the
knowledge of the trademark in the relevant sector of the public,
including knowledge in the Party's territory obtained as a result
of the promotion of the trademark.  No Party may require that the
reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the
public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services.

7.   Each Party shall provide that the initial registration of a
trademark be for a term of at least 10 years and that the
registration be indefinitely renewable for terms of not less than
10 years when conditions for renewal have been met.

8.   Each Party shall require the use of a trademark to maintain
a registration.  The registration may be canceled for the reason
of non-use only after an uninterrupted period of at least two
years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the existence of
obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner.  Each
Party shall recognize, as valid reasons for non-use,
circumstances arising independently of the will of the trademark
owner that constitute an obstacle to the use of the trademark,
such as import restrictions on, or other government requirements
for, goods or services identified by the trademark.

9.   Each Party shall recognize use of a trademark by a person
other than the trademark owner, where such use is subject to the
owner's control, as use of the trademark for purposes of
maintaining the registration.

10.  No Party shall encumber the use of a trademark in commerce
by special requirements, such as a use that reduces the
trademark's function as an indication of source or a use with
another trademark.

11.  A Party may determine conditions on the licensing and
assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the compulsory
licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and that the owner
of a registered trademark shall have the right to assign its
trademark with or without the transfer of the business to which
the trademark belongs.

12.  A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights
conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms,
provided that such exceptions take into account the legitimate
interests of the trademark owner and of other persons.

13.  Each Party shall prohibit the registration as a trademark of
words, at least in English, French or Spanish, that generically
designate goods or services or types of goods or services to
which the trademark applies.

14.  Each Party shall refuse to register trademarks that consist
of or comprise immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter, or matter
that may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons,
living or dead, institutions, beliefs or any Party's national
symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute.


Article 1709: Patents

1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall make patents
available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in
all fields of technology, provided that such inventions are new,
result from an inventive step and are capable of industrial
application.  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may deem
the terms "inventive step" and "capable of industrial
application" to be synonymous with the terms "non-obvious" and
"useful", respectively.

2.   A Party may exclude from patentability inventions if
preventing in its territory the commercial exploitation of the
inventions is necessary to protect ordre public or morality,
including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to
avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided
that the exclusion is not based solely on the ground that the
Party prohibits commercial exploitation in its territory of the
subject matter of the patent.

3.   A Party may also exclude from patentability:

     (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the
 treatment of humans or animals;

     (b) plants and animals other than microorganisms; and

     (c) essentially biological processes for the production of
 plants or animals, other than non-biological and
 microbiological processes for such production.

Notwithstanding subparagraph (b), each Party shall provide for
the protection of plant varieties through patents, an effective
scheme of sui generis protection, or both.

4.   If a Party has not made available product patent protection
for pharmaceutical or agricultural chemicals commensurate with
paragraph 1:

     (a) as of January 1, 1992, for subject matter that relates
 to naturally occurring substances prepared or produced
 by, or significantly derived from, microbiological
 processes and intended for food or medicine; and

     (b) as of July 1, 1991, for any other subject matter,

that Party shall provide to the inventor of any such product or
its assignee the means to obtain product patent protection for
such product for the unexpired term of the patent for such
product granted in another Party, as long as the product has not
been marketed in the Party providing protection under this
paragraph and the person seeking such protection makes a timely
request.

5.   Each Party shall provide that:

     (a) where the subject matter of a patent is a product, the
 patent shall confer on the patent owner the right to
 prevent other persons from making, using or selling the
 subject matter of the patent, without the patent
 owner's consent; and 

     (b) where the subject matter of a patent is a process, the
 patent shall confer on the patent owner the right to
 prevent other persons from using that process and from
 using, selling, or importing at least the product
 obtained directly by that process, without the patent
 owner's consent.

6.   A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive
rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do
not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the
patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests
of the patent owner, taking into account the legitimate interests
of other persons.

7.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, patents shall be available
and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the
field of technology, the territory of the Party where the
invention was made and whether products are imported or locally
produced.

8.   A Party may revoke a patent only when:

     (a) grounds exist that would have justified a refusal to
 grant the patent; or

     (b) the grant of a compulsory license has not remedied the
 lack of exploitation of the patent.

9.   Each Party shall permit patent owners to assign and transfer
by succession their patents, and to conclude licensing contracts.

10.  Where the law of a Party allows for use of the subject
matter of a patent, other than that use  allowed under paragraph
6, without the authorization of the right holder, including use
by the government or other persons authorized by the government,
the Party shall respect the following provisions:

     (a) authorization of such use shall be considered on its
 individual merits;

     (b) such use may only be permitted if, prior to such use,
 the proposed user has made efforts to obtain
 authorization from the right holder on reasonable
 commercial terms and conditions and such efforts have
 not been successful within a reasonable period of time. 
 The requirement to make such efforts may be waived by a
 Party in the case of a national emergency or other
 circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public
 non-commercial use.  In situations of national
 emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency,
 the right holder shall, nevertheless, be notified as
 soon as reasonably practicable.  In the case of public
 non-commercial use, where the government or contractor,
 without making a patent search, knows or has
 demonstrable grounds to know that a valid patent is or
 will be used by or for the government, the right holder
 shall be informed promptly;

     (c) the scope and duration of such use shall be limited to
 the purpose for which it was authorized;

     (d) such use shall be non-exclusive;

     (e) such use shall be non-assignable, except with that part
 of the enterprise or goodwill that enjoys such use;

     (f) any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the
 supply of the Party's domestic market;

     (g) authorization for such use shall be liable, subject to
 adequate protection of the legitimate interests of the
 persons so authorized, to be terminated if and when the
 circumstances that led to it cease to exist and are
 unlikely to recur.  The competent authority shall have
 the authority to review, upon motivated request, the
 continued existence of these circumstances;

     (h) the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration in
 the circumstances of each case, taking into account the
 economic value of the authorization;

     (i) the legal validity of any decision relating to the
 authorization shall be subject to judicial or other
 independent review by a distinct higher authority;

     (j) any decision relating to the remuneration provided in
 respect of such use shall be subject to judicial or
 other independent review by a distinct higher
 authority; 

     (k) the Party shall not be obliged to apply the conditions
 set out in subparagraphs (b) and (f) where such use is
 permitted to remedy a practice determined after
 judicial or administrative process to be
 anticompetitive.  The need to correct anticompetitive
 practices may be taken into account in determining the
 amount of remuneration in such cases.  Competent
 authorities shall have the authority to refuse
 termination of authorization if and when the conditions
 that led to such authorization are likely to recur;

     (l) the Party shall not authorize the use of the subject
 matter of a patent to permit the exploitation of
 another patent except as a remedy for an adjudicated
 violation of domestic laws regarding anticompetitive
 practices.

11.  Where the subject matter of a patent is a process for
obtaining a product, each Party shall, in any infringement
proceeding, place on the defendant the burden of establishing
that the allegedly infringing product was made by a process other
than the patented process in one of the following situations:

     (a) the product obtained by the patented process is new; or

     (b) a substantial likelihood exists that the allegedly
 infringing product was made by the process and the
 patent owner has been unable through reasonable efforts
 to determine the process actually used. 

In the gathering and evaluation of evidence, the legitimate
interests of the defendant in protecting its trade secrets shall
be taken into account.

12.  Each Party shall provide a term of protection for patents of
at least 20 years from the date of filing or 17 years from the
date of grant.  A Party may extend the term of patent protection,
in appropriate cases, to compensate for delays caused by
regulatory approval processes.


Article 1710: Layout Designs of Semiconductor Integrated
 Circuits

1.   Each Party shall protect layout designs (topographies) of
integrated circuits ("layout designs") in accordance with
Articles 2 through 7, 12 and 16(3), other than Article 6(3), of
the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated
Circuits as opened for signature on 26 May 1989.

2.   Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall make it unlawful
for any person without the right holder's authorization to
import, sell or otherwise distribute for commercial purposes any
of the following:

     (a) a protected layout design;

     (b) an integrated circuit in which a protected layout
 design is incorporated; or 
     
     (c) an article incorporating such an integrated circuit,
 only insofar as it continues to contain an unlawfully
 reproduced layout design.

3.   No Party may make unlawful any of the acts referred to in
paragraph 2 performed in respect of an integrated circuit that
incorporates an unlawfully reproduced layout design or any
article that incorporates such an integrated circuit where the
person performing those acts or ordering those acts to be done
did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when it
acquired the integrated circuit or article incorporating such an
integrated circuit, that it incorporated an unlawfully reproduced
layout design.

4.   Each Party shall provide that, after the person referred to
in paragraph 3 has received sufficient notice that the layout
design was unlawfully reproduced, such person may perform any of
the acts with respect to the stock on hand or ordered before such
notice, but shall be liable to pay the right holder for doing so
an amount equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would be
payable under a freely negotiated license in respect of such a
layout design.

5.   No Party may permit the compulsory licensing of layout
designs of integrated circuits. 
6.   Any Party that requires registration as a condition for
protection of a layout design shall provide that the term of
protection shall not end before the expiration of a period of 10
years counted from the date of:

     (a) filing of the application for registration; or

     (b) the first commercial exploitation of the layout design,
 wherever in the world it occurs.

7.   Where a Party does not require registration as a condition
for protection of a layout design, the Party shall provide a term
of protection of not less than 10 years from the date of the
first commercial exploitation of the layout design, wherever in
the world it occurs.

8.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, a Party may provide that
the protection shall lapse 15 years after the creation of the
layout design.

9.   This Article shall apply, except as provided in Annex
1710.9.


Article 1711: Trade Secrets

1.   Each Party shall provide the legal means for any person to
prevent trade secrets from being disclosed to, acquired by, or
used by others without the consent of the person lawfully in
control of the information in a manner contrary to honest
commercial practices, in so far as:

     (a) the information is secret in the sense that it is not,
 as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly
 of its components, generally known among or readily
 accessible to persons that normally deal with the kind
 of information in question;

     (b) the information has actual or potential commercial
 value because it is secret; and

     (c) the person lawfully in control of the information has
 taken reasonable steps under the circumstances to keep
 it secret.

2.   A Party may require that to qualify for protection a trade
secret must be evidenced in documents, electronic or magnetic
means, optical discs, microfilms, films or other similar
instruments.

3.   No Party may limit the duration of protection for trade
secrets, so long as the conditions in paragraph 1 exist.

4.   No Party may discourage or impede the voluntary licensing of
trade secrets by imposing excessive or discriminatory conditions
on such licenses, or conditions that dilute the value of the
trade secrets.

5.   If a Party requires, as a condition for approving the
marketing of pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical products
that utilize new chemical entities, the submission of undisclosed
test or other data necessary to determine whether the use of such
products is safe and effective, the Party shall protect against
disclosure of the data of persons making such submissions, where
the origination of such data involves considerable effort, except
where the disclosure is necessary to protect the public or unless
steps are taken to ensure that the data is protected against
unfair commercial use.

6.   Each Party shall provide that for data subject to paragraph
5 that are submitted to the Party after the date of entry into
force of this Agreement, no person other than the person that
submitted them may, without the latter's permission, rely on such
data in support of an application for product approval during a
reasonable period of time after their submission.  For this
purpose, a reasonable period shall normally mean not less than
five years from the date on which the Party granted approval to
the person that produced the data for approval to market its
product, taking account of the nature of the data and the
person's efforts and expenditures in producing them.  Subject to
this provision, there shall be no limitation on any Party to
implement abbreviated approval procedures for such products on
the basis of bioequivalence and bioavailability studies.

7.   Where a Party relies upon a marketing approval granted by
another Party, the reasonable period of exclusive use of the data
submitted in connection with obtaining the approval relied upon
shall commence with the date of the first marketing approval
relied upon.


Article 1712: Geographical Indications

1.   Each Party shall provide, in respect of geographical
indications, the legal means for interested persons to prevent:

     (a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation
 of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in
 question originates in a territory, region or locality
 other than the true place of origin, in a manner that
 misleads the public as to the geographical origin of
 the good;

     (b) any use that constitutes an act of unfair competition
 within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris
 Convention.

2.   Each Party shall, on its own initiative if its domestic law
so permits or at the request of an interested person, refuse to
register, or invalidate the registration of, a trademark
containing or consisting of a geographical indication with
respect to goods that do not originate in the indicated
territory, region or locality, if use of the indication in the
trademark for such goods is of such a nature as to mislead the
public as to the geographical origin of the good.

3.   Each Party shall also apply paragraphs 1 and 2 to a
geographical indication that, although correctly indicating the
territory, region or locality in which the goods originate,
falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in
another territory, region or locality.

4.   Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to prevent
continued and similar use of a particular geographical indication
of another Party in connection with goods or services by any of
its nationals or domiciliaries who have used that geographical
indication in a continuous manner with regard to the same or
related goods or services in that Party's territory, either:

     (a)  for at least 10 years, or

     (b) in good faith, before the date of signature of this
 Agreement.

5.   Where a trademark has been applied for or registered in good
faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through
use in good faith, either:

     (a) before the date of application of these provisions in
 that Party, or

     (b) before the geographical indication is protected in its
 Party of origin,

no Party may adopt any measure to implement this Article that
prejudices eligibility for, or the validity of, the registration
of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on the basis
that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a
geographical indication.

6.   No Party shall be required to apply this Article to a
geographical indication if it is identical to the customary term
in common language in that Party's territory for the goods or
services to which the indication applies.

7.   A Party may provide that any request made under this Article
in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be
presented within five years after the adverse use of the
protected indication has become generally known in that Party or
after the date of registration of the trademark in that Party,
provided that the trademark has been published by that date, if
such date is earlier than the date on which the adverse use
became generally known in that Party, provided that the
geographical indication is not used or registered in bad faith.

8.   No Party shall adopt any measure implementing this Article
that would prejudice any person's right to use, in the course of
trade, its name or the name of its predecessor in business,
except where such name forms all or part of a valid trademark in
existence before the geographical indication became protected and
with which there is a likelihood of confusion, or such name is
used in such a manner as to mislead the public.

9.   Nothing in this Chapter shall require a Party to protect a
geographical indication that is not protected, or has fallen into
disuse, in the Party of origin. 


Article 1713: Industrial Designs

1.   Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently
created industrial designs that are new or original.  A Party may
provide that:

     (a) designs are not new or original if they do not
 significantly differ from known designs or combinations
 of known design features; and

     (b) such protection shall not extend to designs dictated
 essentially by technical or functional considerations.

2.   Each Party shall ensure that the requirements for securing
protection for textile designs, in particular in regard to any
cost, examination or publication, do not unreasonably impair a
person's opportunity to seek and obtain such protection.  A Party
may comply with this obligation through industrial design law or
copyright law.

3.   Each Party shall provide the owner of a protected industrial
design the right to prevent other persons not having the owner's
consent from making or selling articles bearing or embodying a
design that is a copy, or substantially a copy, of the protected
design, when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.

4.   A Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of
industrial designs, provided that such exceptions do not
unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected
industrial designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the
legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking
into account the legitimate interests of other persons. 

5.   Each Party shall provide a term of protection for industrial
designs of at least 10 years. 


Article 1714: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights:
 General Provisions

1.   Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures, as
specified in this Article and Articles 1715 through 1718, are
available under its domestic law so as to permit effective action
to be taken against any act of infringement of intellectual
property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious
remedies to prevent infringements and remedies to deter further
infringements.  Such enforcement procedures shall be applied so
as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to
provide for safeguards against abuse of the procedures.

2.   Each Party shall ensure that its procedures for the
enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and
equitable, are not unnecessarily complicated or costly, and do
not entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.

3.   Each Party shall provide that decisions on the merits of a
case in judicial and administrative enforcement proceedings
shall:

     (a) preferably be in writing and preferably state the
 reasons on which the decisions are based;

     (b) be made available at least to the parties in a
 proceeding without undue delay; and

     (c) be based only on evidence in respect of which such
 parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.

4.   Each Party shall ensure that parties in a proceeding have an
opportunity to have final administrative decisions reviewed by a
judicial authority of that Party and, subject to jurisdictional
provisions in its domestic laws concerning the importance of a
case, to have reviewed at least the legal aspects of initial
judicial decisions on the merits of a case.  Notwithstanding the
above, no Party shall be required to provide for judicial review
of acquittals in criminal cases.

5.   Nothing in this Article and in Articles 1715 through 1718
shall require a Party to establish a judicial system for the
enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that
Party's system for the enforcement of laws in general.

6.   For the purposes of Articles 1715 through 1718, the term
"right holder" includes federations and associations having legal
standing to assert such rights.


Article 1715: Specific Procedural and Remedial Aspects of Civil
 and Administrative Procedures

1.   Each Party shall make available to right holders civil
judicial procedures for the enforcement of any intellectual
property right covered by this Chapter.  Each Party shall provide
that:

     (a) defendants have the right to written notice that is
 timely and contains sufficient detail, including the
 basis of the claims;

     (b) parties in a proceeding are allowed to be represented
 by independent legal counsel;

     (c) the procedures do not include imposition of overly
 burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal
 appearances;

     (d) all parties in a proceeding are duly entitled to
 substantiate their claims and to present relevant
 evidence; and

     (e) the procedures include a means to identify and protect
 confidential information.

2.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall
have the authority:

     (a) where a party in a proceeding has presented reasonably
 available evidence sufficient to support its claims and
 has specified evidence relevant to the substantiation
 of its claims that is within the control of the
 opposing party, to order the opposing party to produce
 such evidence, subject in appropriate cases to
 conditions that ensure the protection of confidential
 information;

     (b) where a party in a proceeding voluntarily and without
 good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not
 provide relevant evidence under that party's control
 within a reasonable period, or significantly impedes a
 proceeding relating to an enforcement action, to make
 preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or
 negative, on the basis of the evidence presented,
 including the complaint or the allegation presented by
 the party adversely affected by the denial of access to
 evidence, subject to providing the parties an
 opportunity to be heard on the allegations or evidence;

     (c) to order a party in a proceeding to desist from an
 infringement, including to prevent the date of entry
 into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of
 imported goods that involve the infringement of an
 intellectual property right, which order shall be
 enforceable at least immediately after customs
 clearance of such goods; 

     (d) to order the infringer of an intellectual property
 right to pay the right holder damages adequate to
 compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered
 because of the infringement where the infringer knew or
 had reasonable grounds to know that it was engaged in
 an infringing activity;

     (e) to order an infringer of an intellectual property right
 to pay the right holder's expenses, which may include
 appropriate attorney's fees; and

     (f) to order a party in a proceeding at whose request
 measures were taken and who has abused enforcement
 procedures to provide adequate compensation to any
 party wrongfully enjoined or restrained in the
 proceeding for the injury suffered because of such
 abuse and to pay that party's expenses, which may
 include appropriate attorney's fees.

3.   With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph
2(c), no Party shall be obliged to provide such authority in
respect of protected subject matter that is acquired or ordered
by a person before that person knew or had reasonable grounds to
know that dealing in that subject matter would entail the
infringement of an intellectual property right.

4.   With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph
2(d), a Party may, at least with respect to copyrighted works and
sound recordings, authorize the judicial authorities to order
recovery of profits or payment of pre-established damages, or
both, even where the infringer did not know or had no reasonable
grounds to know that it was engaged in an infringing activity. 

5.   Each Party shall provide that, in order to create an
effective deterrent to infringement, its judicial authorities
shall have the authority to order that:

     (a) goods that they have found to be infringing be, without
 compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the
 channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any
 injury caused to the right holder, or, unless this
 would be contrary to existing constitutional
 requirements, destroyed; and

     (b) materials and implements the predominant use of which
 has been in the creation of the infringing goods be,
 without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside
 the channels of commerce in such a manner as to
 minimize the risks of further infringements.

In considering whether to issue such an order, judicial
authorities shall take into account the need for proportionality
between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies
ordered as well as the interests of other persons.  In regard to
counterfeit goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully
affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases,
to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce.

6.   In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to
the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights,
each Party shall only exempt both public authorities and
officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where
actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of the
administration of such laws.

7.   Notwithstanding the other provisions of Articles 1714
through 1718, where a Party is sued with respect to an
infringement of an intellectual property right as a result of its
use of that right or use on its behalf, that Party may limit the
remedies available against it to the payment to the right holder
of adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case,
taking into account the economic value of the use.

8.   Each Party shall provide that, where a civil remedy can be
ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of
a case, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in
substance to those set out in this Article.


Article 1716: Provisional Measures

1.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall
have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional
measures:

     (a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property
 right, and in particular to prevent the date of entry
 into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of
 allegedly infringing goods, including measures to
 prevent the entry of imported goods at least
 immediately after customs clearance; and

     (b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged
 infringement.

2.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall
have the authority to require any applicant for provisional
measures to provide to the judicial authorities any evidence
reasonably available to that applicant that the judicial
authorities consider necessary to enable them to determine with a
sufficient degree of certainty whether:

     (a) the applicant is the right holder;

     (b) the applicant's right is being infringed or such
 infringement is imminent; and

     (c) any delay in the issuance of such measures is likely to
 cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or there is
 a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.

Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have
the authority to require the applicant to provide a security or
equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the interests of the
defendant and to prevent abuse.

3.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities
shall have the authority to require an applicant for provisional
measures to provide other information necessary for the
identification of the relevant goods by the authority that will
execute the provisional measures.

4.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall
have the authority to order provisional measures on an ex parte
basis, in particular where any delay is likely to cause
irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a
demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.

5.   Each Party shall provide that where provisional measures are
adopted by that Party's judicial authorities on an ex parte
basis:

     (a) a person affected shall be given notice of those
 measures without delay but in any event no later than
 immediately after the execution of the measures;

     (b) a defendant shall, upon request, have those measures
 reviewed by that Party's judicial authorities, for the
 purpose of deciding, within a reasonable period after
 notice of those measures is given, whether the measures
 shall be modified, revoked or confirmed, and shall be
 given an opportunity to be heard in the review
 proceedings.

6.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, each Party shall provide
that, upon the request of the defendant, the Party's judicial
authorities shall revoke or otherwise cease to apply the
provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 4 if
proceedings leading to a decision on the merits are not
initiated:

     (a) within a reasonable period as determined by the
 judicial authority ordering the measures where the
 Party's domestic law so permits; or

     (b) in the absence of such a determination, within a period
 of no more than 20 working days or 31 calendar days,
 whichever is longer.

7.   Each Party shall provide that, where the provisional
measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or
omission by the applicant, or where the judicial authorities
subsequently find that there has been no infringement or threat
of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial
authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, on
request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate
compensation for any injury caused by these measures.

8.   Each Party shall provide that, where a provisional measure
can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such
procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to
those set out in this Article.


Article 1717: Criminal Procedures and Penalties

1.   Each Party shall provide criminal procedures and penalties
to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark
counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.  Each
Party shall provide that penalties available include imprisonment
or monetary fines, or both, sufficient to provide a deterrent,
consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a
corresponding gravity.

2.   Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate cases, its
judicial authorities may order the seizure, forfeiture and
destruction of infringing goods and of any materials and
implements the predominant use of which has been in the
commission of the offense.

3.   A Party may provide criminal procedures and penalties to be
applied in cases of infringement of intellectual property rights,
other than those in paragraph 1, where they are committed
wilfully and on a commercial scale.


Article 1718: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights at the
 Border

1.   Each Party shall, in conformity with this Article, adopt
procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for
suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark goods or
pirated copyright goods may take place, to lodge an application
in writing with its competent authorities, whether administrative
or judicial, for the suspension by the customs administration of
the release of such goods into free circulation.  No Party shall
be obligated to apply such procedures to goods in transit.  A
Party may permit such an application to be made in respect of
goods that involve other infringements of intellectual property
rights, provided that the requirements of this Article are met. 
A Party may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning
the suspension by the customs administration of the release of
infringing goods destined for exportation from its territory.

2.   Each Party shall require any applicant who initiates
procedures under paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence:

     (a) to satisfy that Party's competent authorities that,
 under the domestic laws of the country of importation,
 there is prima facie an infringement of its
 intellectual property right; and 

     (b) to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the
 goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs
 administration. 

The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a
reasonable period whether they have accepted the application and,
if so, the period for which the customs administration will take
action.

3.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities
shall have the authority to require an applicant under paragraph
1 to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to
protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to
prevent abuse.  Such security or equivalent assurance shall not
unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.

4.   Each Party shall provide that, where pursuant to an
application under procedures adopted pursuant to this Article,
its customs administration suspends the release of goods
involving industrial designs, patents, integrated circuits or
trade secrets into free circulation on the basis of a decision
other than by a judicial or other independent authority, and the
period provided for in paragraphs 6 through 8 has expired without
the granting of provisional relief by the duly empowered
authority, and provided that all other conditions for importation
have been complied with, the owner, importer, or consignee of
such goods shall be entitled to their release on the posting of a
security in an amount sufficient to protect the right holder
against any infringement.  Payment of such security shall not
prejudice any other remedy available to the right holder, it
being understood that the security shall be released if the right
holder fails to pursue its right of action within a reasonable
period of time.

5.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration
shall promptly notify the importer and the applicant when the
customs administration suspends the release of goods pursuant to
paragraph 1.

6.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration
shall release goods from suspension if within a period not
exceeding ten working days after the applicant under paragraph 1
has been served notice of the suspension:

     (a) the customs administration has not been informed that a
 party other than the defendant has initiated
 proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the
 case, or

     (b) a competent authority has taken provisional measures
 prolonging the suspension,

provided that all other conditions for importation or exportation
have been met.  Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate
cases, the customs administration may extend the suspension by
another 10 working days.

7.   Each Party shall provide that if proceedings leading to a
decision on the merits of the case have been initiated, a review,
including a right to be heard, shall take place on request of the
defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period,
whether the measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.

8.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, where the suspension of
the release of goods is carried out or continued in accordance
with a provisional judicial measure, the provisions of Article
1716(6) shall apply.

9.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities
shall have the authority to order the applicant under paragraph 1
to pay the importer, the consignee and the owner of the goods
appropriate compensation for any injury caused to them through
the wrongful detention of goods or through the detention of goods
released pursuant to paragraph 6.

10.  Without prejudice to the protection of confidential
information, each Party shall provide that its competent
authorities shall have the authority to give the right holder
sufficient opportunity to have any goods detained by the customs
administration inspected in order to substantiate its claims. 
Each Party shall also provide that its competent authorities have
the authority to give the importer an equivalent opportunity to
have any such goods inspected.  Where the competent authorities
have made a positive determination on the merits of a case, a
Party may provide the competent authorities the authority to
inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the
consignor, the importer and the consignee, and of the quantity of
the goods in question.

11.  Where a Party requires its competent authorities to act upon
their own initiative and to suspend the release of goods in
respect of which they have acquired prima facie evidence that an
intellectual property right is being infringed:

     (a) the competent authorities may at any time seek from the
 right holder any information that may assist them to
 exercise these powers;

     (b) the importer and the right holder shall be promptly
 notified of the suspension by the Party's competent
 authorities, and where the importer lodges an appeal
 against the suspension with competent authorities, the
 suspension shall be subject to the conditions, with
 such modifications as are necessary, set out in
 paragraphs 6 through 8; and

     (c) the Party shall only exempt both public authorities and
 officials from liability to appropriate remedial
 measures where actions are taken or intended in good
 faith.

12.  Without prejudice to other rights of action open to the
right holder and subject to the defendant's right to seek
judicial review, each Party shall provide that its competent
authorities shall have the authority to order the destruction or
disposal of infringing goods in accordance with the principles
set out in Article 1715(5).  In regard to counterfeit goods, the
authorities shall not allow the re-exportation of the infringing
goods in an unaltered state or subject them to a different
customs procedure, other than in exceptional circumstances.

13.  A Party may exclude from the application of paragraphs 1
through 12 small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature
contained in travellers' personal luggage or sent in small
consignments that are not repetitive.

14.  This Article shall apply, except as provided in Annex
1718.14.


Article 1719: Cooperation and Technical Assistance

1.   The Parties shall provide each other on mutually agreed
terms with technical assistance and shall promote cooperation
between their competent authorities.  Such cooperation shall
include, but not be limited to, the training of personnel.

2.   The Parties shall cooperate with a view to eliminating trade
in goods that infringe intellectual property rights.  For this
purpose, each Party shall establish and notify the other Parties
of contact points in its federal government and shall exchange
information concerning trade in infringing goods.


Article 1720: Protection of Existing Subject Matter

1.   Other than the provisions of Article 1705(7), this Agreement
does not give rise to obligations in respect of acts that
occurred before the date of application of the relevant
provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question.

2.   Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each
Party shall apply this Agreement to all subject matter existing
on the date of application of the relevant provisions of this
Agreement for the Party in question, and which is protected in a
Party on the said date, or which meets or comes subsequently to

determined under Article 18 of the Berne Convention and with
respect to the rights of producers of sound recordings in
existing sound recordings shall be determined solely under
Article 18 of that Convention, as made applicable under this
Agreement.

3.   Except as required under Article 1705(7), and
notwithstanding paragraph 2, a Party shall not be required to
restore protection to subject matter that, on the date of
application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for the
Party in question, has fallen into the public domain in its
territory.

4.   Any acts in respect of specific objects embodying protected
subject matter which become infringing under the terms of
legislation in conformity with this Agreement, and which were
commenced or in respect of which a significant investment was
made, before the date of ratification of this Agreement by that
Party, any Party may provide for a limitation of the remedies
available to the right holder as to the continued performance of
such acts after the date of application of the Agreement for that
Party.  In such cases, the Party shall, however, at least provide
for payment of equitable remuneration.

5.   No Party shall be obliged to apply the provisions of Article
1705(2)(d) or Article 1706(1)(d) with respect to originals or
copies purchased prior to the date of application of the relevant
provisions of this Agreement for that Party.

6.   No Party shall be required to apply Article 1709(10), or the
requirement in Article 1709(7) that patent rights shall be
enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology,
to use without the authorization of the right holder where
authorization for such use was granted by the government before
the text of the Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the
Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations became known.

7.   In the case of intellectual property rights for which
protection is conditional upon registration, applications for
protection that are pending on the date of application of the
relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question
shall be permitted to be amended to claim any enhanced protection
provided under the provisions of this Agreement.  Such amendments
shall not include new matter.

               Review and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping
                      and Countervailing Duty Matters



Article 1901: General Provisions

1.   The provisions of Article 1904 shall apply only with respect
to goods that the competent investigating authority of the
importing Party, applying the importing Party's antidumping or
countervailing duty law to the facts of a specific case,
determines are goods of another Party.

2.   For the purposes of Articles 1903 and 1904, panels shall be
established in accordance with the provisions of Annex 1901.2.

3.   With the exception of Article 2203 (Entry into Force), no
provision of any other chapter of this Agreement shall be
construed as imposing obligations on the Parties with respect to
the Parties' antidumping law or countervailing duty law.


Article 1902: Retention of Domestic Antidumping Law and
 Countervailing Duty Law

1.   Each Party reserves the right to apply its antidumping law
and countervailing duty law to goods imported from the territory
of any other Party.  Antidumping law and countervailing duty law
include, as appropriate for each Party, relevant statutes,
legislative history, regulations, administrative practice and
judicial precedents.

2.   Each Party reserves the right to change or modify its
antidumping law or countervailing duty law, provided that in the
case of an amendment to a Party's antidumping or countervailing
duty statute:

     (a) such amendment shall apply to goods from another Party
 only if the amending statute specifies that it applies
 to the Parties to this Agreement;

     (b) the amending Party notifies any Party to which the
 amendment applies in writing of the amending statute as
 far in advance as possible of the date of enactment of
 such statute;

     (c) following notification, the amending Party, upon
 request of any Party to which the amendment applies,
 consults with that Party prior to the enactment of the
 amending statute; and

     (d) such amendment, as applicable to another Party, is not
 inconsistent with:

     (i) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
 the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of
 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the
 Antidumping Code) or the Agreement on the
 Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI
 and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
 Trade (the Subsidies Code), or successor
 agreements to which all the original signatories
 to this Agreement are party, or

     (ii) the object and purpose of this Agreement and this
 Chapter, which is to establish fair and
 predictable conditions for the progressive
 liberalization of trade among the Parties to this
 Agreement while maintaining effective and fair
 disciplines on unfair trade practices, such object
 and purpose to be ascertained from the provisions
 of this Agreement, its preamble and objectives and
 the practices of the Parties.


Article 1903: Review of Statutory Amendments

1.   A Party to which an amendment of another Party's antidumping
or countervailing duty statute applies may request in writing
that such amendment be referred to a binational panel for a
declaratory opinion as to whether:

     (a) the amendment does not conform to the provisions of
 Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii); or

     (b) such amendment has the function and effect of
 overturning a prior decision of a panel made pursuant
 to Article 1904 and does not conform to the provisions
 of Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii).

Such declaratory opinion shall have force or effect only as
provided in this Article.

2.   The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the
procedures of Annex 1903.2.

3.   In the event that the panel recommends modifications to the
amending statute to remedy a non-conformity that it has
identified in its opinion:

     (a) the two Parties shall immediately begin consultations
 and shall seek to achieve a mutually satisfactory
 solution to the matter within 90 days of the issuance
 of the panel's final declaratory opinion.  Such
 solution may include seeking corrective legislation
 with respect to the statute of the amending Party; 

     (b) if corrective legislation is not enacted within nine
 months from the end of the 90-day consultation period
 referred to in subparagraph (a) and no other mutually
 satisfactory solution has been reached, the Party that
 requested the panel may

     (i) take comparable legislative or equivalent
 executive action, or

     (ii) terminate this Agreement with regard to the
 amending Party upon 60-day written notice to that
 Party.


Article 1904: Review of Final Antidumping and Countervailing
 Determinations

1.   As provided in this Article, the Parties shall replace
judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty
determinations with binational panel review.

2.   An involved Party may request that a panel review, based
upon the administrative record, a final antidumping or
countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating
authority of a Party to determine whether such determination was
in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of
the importing Party.  For this purpose, the antidumping or
countervailing duty law consists of the relevant statutes,
legislative history, regulations, administrative practice and
judicial precedents to the extent that a court of the importing
Party would rely on such materials in reviewing a final
determination of the competent investigating authority.  Solely
for purposes of the panel review provided for in this Article,
the antidumping and countervailing duty statutes of the Parties,
as those statutes may be amended from time to time, are
incorporated into this Agreement. 

3.   The panel shall apply the standard of review described in
Article 1909 and the general legal principles that a court of the
importing Party otherwise would apply to a review of a
determination of the competent investigating authority. 

4.   A request for a panel shall be made in writing to the other
involved Party within 30 days following the date of publication
of the final determination in question in the official journal of
the importing Party.  In the case of final determinations that
are not published in the official journal of the importing Party,
the importing Party shall immediately notify the other involved
Party of such final determination where it involves goods from
the other involved Party, and the other involved Party may
request a panel within 30 days of receipt of such notice.  Where
the competent investigating authority of the importing Party has
imposed provisional measures in an investigation, the other
involved Party may provide notice of its intention to request a
panel under this Article, and the Parties shall begin to
establish a panel at that time.  Failure to request a panel
within the time specified in this paragraph shall preclude review
by a panel.

5.   An involved Party on its own initiative may request review
of a final determination by a panel and shall, upon request of a
person who would otherwise be entitled under the law of the
importing Party to commence domestic procedures for judicial
review of that final determination, request such review. 

6.   The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the
procedures established by the Parties pursuant to paragraph 14.
Where both involved Parties request a panel to review a final
determination, a single panel shall review that determination.

7.   The competent investigating authority that issued the final
determination in question shall have the right to appear and be
represented by counsel before the panel.  Each Party shall
provide that other persons who, pursuant to the law of the
importing Party, otherwise would have had the right to appear and
be represented in a domestic judicial review proceeding
concerning the determination of the competent investigating
authority, shall have the right to appear and be represented by
counsel before the panel. 

8.   The panel may uphold a final determination, or remand it for
action not inconsistent with the panel's decision.  Where the
panel remands a final determination, the panel shall establish as
brief a time as is reasonable for compliance with the remand,
taking into account the complexity of the factual and legal
issues involved and the nature of the panel's decision.  In no
event shall the time permitted for compliance with a remand
exceed an amount of time equal to the maximum amount of time
(counted from the date of the filing of a petition, complaint or
application) permitted by statute for the competent investigating
authority in question to make a final determination in an
investigation.  If review of the action taken by the competent
investigating authority on remand is needed, such review shall be
before the same panel, which shall normally issue a final
decision within 90 days of the date on which such remand action
is submitted to it.

9.   The decision of a panel under this Article shall be binding
on the involved Parties with respect to the particular matter
between the Parties that is before the panel. 

10.  This Agreement shall not affect: 

     (a) the judicial review procedures of any Party; or

     (b) cases appealed under those procedures,

with respect to determinations other than final determinations. 

11.  A final determination shall not be reviewed under any
judicial review procedures of the importing Party if an involved
Party requests a panel with respect to that determination within
the time limits set forth in this Article.  No Party shall
provide in its domestic legislation for an appeal from a panel
decision to its domestic courts. 

12.  The provisions of this Article shall not apply where:

     (a) neither involved Party seeks panel review of a final
 determination; 

     (b) a revised final determination is issued as a direct
 result of judicial review of the original final
 determination by a court of the importing Party in
 cases where neither involved Party sought panel review
 of that original final determination; or

     (c) a final determination is issued as a direct result of
 judicial review that was commenced in a court of the
 importing Party before the date of entry into force of
 this Agreement.

13.  Where within a reasonable time after the panel decision is
issued, an involved Party alleges that:

     (a) (i) a member of the panel was guilty of gross
 misconduct, bias, or a serious conflict of
 interest, or otherwise materially violated the
 rules of conduct,

     (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental
 rule of procedure, or

     (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers,
 authority or jurisdiction set forth in this
 Article, for example by failing to apply the
 appropriate standard of review, and

     (b) any of the actions set out in subparagraph (a) has
 materially affected the panel's decision and threatens
 the integrity of the binational panel review process,

that Party may avail itself of the extraordinary challenge
procedure set out in Annex 1904.13.

14.  To implement the provisions of this Article, the Parties
shall adopt rules of procedure by January 1, 1994.  Such rules
shall be based, where appropriate, upon judicial rules of
appellate procedure, and shall include rules concerning: the
content and service of requests for panels; a requirement that
the competent investigating authority transmit to the panel the
administrative record of the proceeding; the protection of
business proprietary, government classified, and other privileged
information (including sanctions against persons participating
before panels for improper release of such information);
participation by private persons; limitations on panel review to
errors alleged by the Parties or private persons; filing and
service; computation and extensions of time; the form and content
of briefs and other papers; pre- and post-hearing conferences;
motions; oral argument; requests for rehearing; and voluntary
terminations of panel reviews.  The rules shall be designed to
result in final decisions within 315 days of the date on which a
request for a panel is made, and shall allow:

     (a) 30 days for the filing of the complaint;

     (b) 30 days for designation or certification of the
 administrative record and its filing with the panel;

     (c) 60 days for the complainant to file its brief;

     (d) 60 days for the respondent to file its brief;

     (e) 15 days for the filing of reply briefs;

     (f) 15 to 30 days for the panel to convene and hear oral
 argument; and

     (g) 90 days for the panel to issue its written decision.

15.  In order to achieve the objectives of this Article, the
Parties shall, with respect to goods of the other Parties, amend
their antidumping and countervailing duty statutes and
regulations, and other statutes and regulations to the extent
that they apply to the operation of the antidumping and
countervailing duty laws.  In particular, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: 

     (a) each Party shall amend its statutes or regulations to
 ensure that existing procedures concerning the refund,
 with interest, of antidumping or countervailing duties
 operate to give effect to a final panel decision that a
 refund is due;

     (b) each Party shall amend its statutes or regulations to
 ensure that its courts shall give full force and
 effect, with respect to any person within its
 jurisdiction, to all sanctions imposed pursuant to the
 laws of the other Parties to enforce provisions of any
 protective order or undertaking that such other Party
 has promulgated or accepted in order to permit access
 for purposes of panel review or of the extraordinary
 challenge procedure to confidential, personal, business
 proprietary or other privileged information;

     (c) each Party shall amend its statutes or regulations to
 ensure that

     (i) domestic procedures for judicial review of a final
 determination may not be commenced until the time
 for requesting a panel under paragraph 4 has
 expired, and

     (ii) as a prerequisite to commencing domestic judicial
 review procedures to review a final determination,
 a Party or other person intending to commence such
 procedures shall provide notice of such intent to
 the Parties concerned and to other persons
 entitled to commence such review procedures of the
 same final determination no later than 10 days
 prior to the latest date on which a panel may be
 requested; and

     (d) Each Party shall make the further amendments set forth
 in Annex 1904.15(d).


Article 1905: Safeguarding the Panel Review System

1.   Where a Party alleges that the application of another
Party's domestic law,

     (a) has prevented the establishment of a panel requested by
 the complaining Party;

     (b) has prevented a panel requested by the complaining
 Party from rendering a final decision;

     (c) has prevented the implementation of the decision of a
 panel requested by the complaining Party or denied it
 binding force and effect with respect to the particular
 matter that was before the panel; or 

     (d) has resulted in a failure to provide opportunity for
 review of a final determination by a court or panel of
 competent jurisdiction that is independent of the
 competent investigating authorities, that examines the
 basis for the investigating authorities' determination
 and whether the investigating authority properly
 applied domestic antidumping and countervailing duty
 law in reaching the challenged determination, and that
 employs the relevant standard of review identified in
 Article 1911,

that Party may request in writing consultations with the other
Party regarding the allegations.  The consultations shall begin
within 15 days of the date of the request.

2.   If the matter has not been resolved within 45 days of the
request for consultations or such other period as the consulting
Parties may agree, the complaining Party may request the
establishment of a special committee.  

3.   Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Parties, the
special committee shall be established within 15 days of a
request and perform its functions in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this Chapter.

4.   The roster for special committees shall be that established
pursuant to Annex 1904.13.1.

respect of one of the grounds specified in paragraph 1, the
complaining Party and the Party complained against shall begin
consultations within 10 days, and shall seek to achieve a
mutually satisfactory solution within 60 days of the issuance of
the committee's report.

8.   If, within the 60-day period, the Parties are unable to
reach a mutually satisfactory solution to the matter, or the
Party complained against has not demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the special committee that it has corrected the problem or
problems with respect to which the committee has made an
affirmative finding, the complaining Party may:

     (a) suspend the operation of Article 1904 with respect to
 the Party complained against; or

     (b) suspend the application to the Party complained against
 of such benefits under this Agreement as may be
 appropriate under the circumstances.

9.   In the event that a complaining Party suspends the operation
of Article 1904 with respect to the Party complained against, the

1904.  If either Party decides to suspend the operation of
Article 1904, it shall provide written notice of such suspension
to the other Party.

10.  The special committee may reconvene at any time, at the
request of the Party complained against, to determine:

     (a) whether the suspension of benefits by the complaining
 Party pursuant to subparagraph 8(b) is manifestly
 excessive; or

     (b) whether the Party complained against has corrected the
 problem or problems with respect to which the committee
 has made an affirmative finding.

The special committee shall, within 45 days of the request,
present a report to both Parties containing its determination. 
Where the special committee determines that the Party complained
against has corrected the problem or problems, any suspension
effected by the complaining Party or the Party complained
against, or both, pursuant to paragraphs 8 or 9 shall be
terminated.

     (a) binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee
 review under Article 1904 shall be stayed

     (i) with respect to review of any final determination
 of the complaining Party requested by the Party
 complained against, if such review was requested
 after the date on which consultations were
 requested pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article
 and in no case later than 150 days prior to an
 affirmative finding by the special committee, or

     (ii) with respect to review of any final determination
 of the Party complained against requested by the
 complaining Party, at the request of the
 complaining Party; and 

     (b) the time for requesting panel or committee review under
 Article 1904 shall be tolled.

12.  If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904
pursuant to paragraph 8(a), the panel or committee review stayed
under paragraph 11(a) shall be terminated and the challenge to
the final determination  shall be irrevocably referred to the
appropriate domestic court for decision, as provided below:

     (a) with respect to review of any final determination of
 the complaining Party requested by the Party complained
 against, at the request of either Party, or of a party
 to the panel review under Article 1904; or

 the Party complained against requested by the
 complaining Party, at the request of the complaining
 Party, or of a party of the complaining Party that is a
 party to the panel review under Article 1904.

If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 pursuant
to paragraph 8(a), any time period tolled under Paragraph 11(b)
of this Article shall resume.

If such suspension does not become effective, panel or committee
review stayed under paragraph 11(a), and any time period tolled
under paragraph 8(b), shall resume.


Article 1906: Prospective Application

     The provisions of this Chapter shall apply only
prospectively to:

     (a) final determinations of a competent investigating
 authority made after the date of entry into force of
 this Agreement; and

     (b) with respect to declaratory opinions under
 Article 1903, amendments to antidumping or
 countervailing duty statutes enacted after the date of
 entry into force of this Agreement.


Article 1907: Consultations

1.   The Parties shall consult annually, or on the request of any
Party, to consider any problems that may arise with respect to
the implementation or operation of this Chapter and recommend
solutions, where appropriate.  The Parties shall each designate
one or more officials, including officials of the competent
investigating authorities, to be responsible for ensuring that
consultations occur, when required, so that the provisions of
this Chapter are carried out expeditiously.

2.   The Parties further agree to consult on:

     (a) the potential to develop more effective rules and
 disciplines concerning the use of government subsidies;
 and

     (b) the potential for reliance on a substitute system of
 rules for dealing with unfair transborder pricing
 practices and government subsidization.

3.   The competent investigating authorities of the Parties shall
consult annually or on the request of any Party and may submit
reports to the Commission, if appropriate.  In the context of
these consultations, the Parties agree that it is desirable in
the administration of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws
to:

     (a) publish notice of initiation of investigations in the
 importing country's official journal, setting forth the
 nature of the proceeding, the legal authority under
 which the proceeding is initiated, and a description of
 the product at issue;

     (b) provide notice of the times for submissions of
 information and for decisions that the competent
 investigating authorities are expressly required by
 statute or regulations to make;  

     (c) provide explicit written notice and instructions as to
 the information required from interested parties,
 including foreign interests, and reasonable time to
 respond to requests for information; 

     (d) accord reasonable access to information

     (i) "reasonable access" in this context means access
 during the course of the investigation, to the
 extent practicable, so as to permit an opportunity
 to present facts and arguments as set forth in
 paragraph (e); when it is not practicable to
 provide access to information during the
 investigation in such time as to permit an
 opportunity to present facts and arguments,
 reasonable access shall mean in time to permit the
 adversely affected party to make an informed
 decision as to whether to seek judicial or panel
 review,

     (ii) "access to information" in this context means
 access to representatives determined by the
 competent investigating authority to be qualified
 to have access to information received by that
 competent investigating authority, including
 access to confidential (business proprietary)
 information, but does not include information of
 such high degree of sensitivity that its release
 would lead to substantial and irreversible harm to
 the owner or which is required to be kept
 confidential in accordance with domestic
 legislation of a Party; any privileges arising
 under domestic law of the importing Party relating
 to communications between the competent
 investigating authorities and a lawyer in the
 employ of, or providing advice to, those
 authorities may be maintained;

     (e) provide the opportunity for interested parties,
 including foreign interests, to present facts and
 arguments, to the extent time permits, including an
 opportunity to comment on the preliminary determination
 of dumping or of subsidization;

     (f) protect confidential (business proprietary)
 information, received by the competent investigating
 authority, to ensure that there is no disclosure except
 to representatives determined by the competent
 investigating authorities to be qualified;

     (g) prepare administrative records, including
 recommendations of official advisory bodies that may be
 required to be kept, and any record of ex parte
 meetings that may be required to be kept;

     (h) provide disclosure of relevant information upon which
 any preliminary or final determination of dumping or of
 subsidization is based, within a reasonable time after
 a request by interested parties, including foreign
 interests.  Such information shall include an
 explanation of the calculation or the methodology used
 to determine the margin of dumping or the amount of
 subsidy;

     (i) provide a statement of reasons concerning the final
 determination of dumping or subsidization; and

     (j) provide a statement of reasons for final determinations
 concerning material injury to a domestic industry,
 threat of material injury to a domestic industry or
 material retardation of the establishment of such an
 industry. 

Inclusion of an item in paragraphs (a) through (j) is not
intended to serve as guidance to a binational panel reviewing a
final antidumping or countervailing duty determination pursuant
to Article 1904 in determining whether such determination was in
accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the
importing Party.


Article 1908: Special Secretariat Provisions

upon request to the secretary of the Party that is not an
involved Party in the proceeding a copy of such public documents
as are requested.

5.   The remuneration of panelists or committee members, their
travel and lodging expenses, and all general expenses of the
panels or committees shall be borne equally by the involved
Parties.  Each panelist or committee member shall keep a record
and render a final account of the person's time and expenses, and

                    Establishment of Binational Panels


1.   Prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the
Parties shall develop a roster of individuals to serve as
panelists in disputes under this Chapter.  The roster shall
include sitting or retired judges to the fullest extent
practicable.  The Parties shall consult in developing the roster,
which shall include at least 75 candidates.  Each Party shall
select at least 25 candidates, and all candidates shall be
citizens of Canada, the United States or Mexico.  Candidates
shall be of good character, high standing and repute, and shall
be chosen strictly on the basis of objectivity, reliability,
sound judgment and general familiarity with international trade
law.  Candidates shall not be affiliated with a Party, and in no
event shall a candidate take instructions from a Party.  Judges
shall not be considered to be affiliated with a Party.  The
Parties shall maintain the roster, and may amend it, when
necessary, after consultations.

2.   A majority of the panelists on each panel shall be lawyers
in good standing.  Within 30 days of a request for a panel, each
involved Party shall appoint two panelists, in consultation with
the other involved Party.  The involved Parties normally shall
appoint panelists from the roster.  If a panelist is not selected
from the roster, the panelist shall be chosen in accordance with
and be subject to the criteria of paragraph 1.  Each involved
Party shall have the right to exercise four peremptory
challenges, to be exercised simultaneously and in confidence,
disqualifying from appointment to the panel up to four candidates
proposed by the other involved Party.  Peremptory challenges and
the selection of alternative panelists shall occur within 45 days
of the request for the panel.  If an involved Party fails to
appoint its members to a panel within 30 days or if a panelist is
struck and no alternative panelist is selected within 45 days,
such panelist shall be selected by lot on the 31st or 46th day,
as the case may be, from that Party's candidates on the roster. 

3.   Within 55 days of the request for a panel, the involved
Parties shall agree on the selection of a fifth panelist.  If the
involved Parties are unable to agree, they shall decide by lot
which of them shall select, by the 61st day, the fifth panelist
from the roster, excluding candidates eliminated by peremptory
challenges. 

4.   Upon appointment of the fifth panelist, the panelists shall
promptly appoint a chairman from among the lawyers on the panel
by majority vote of the panelists.  If there is no majority vote,
the chairman shall be appointed by lot from among the lawyers on
the panel. 

5.   Decisions of the panel shall be by majority vote and based
upon the votes of all members of the panel.  The panel shall
issue a written decision with reasons, together with any
dissenting or concurring opinions of panelists. 

6.   Panelists shall be subject to the code of conduct
established pursuant to Article 1909.  If an involved Party
believes that a panelist is in violation of the code of conduct,
the involved Parties shall consult and if they agree, the
panelist shall be removed and a new panelist shall be selected in
accordance with the procedures of this Annex. 

7.   When a panel is convened pursuant to Article 1904 each
panelist shall be required to sign: 

     (a) an application for protective order for information
 supplied by the United States or its persons covering
 business proprietary and other privileged information; 

     (b) an undertaking for information supplied by Canada or
 its persons covering confidential, personal, business
 proprietary and other privileged information; or 

     (c) an undertaking for information supplied by Mexico or

an application for protective order or disclosure undertaking,
the importing Party shall grant access to the information covered
by such order or disclosure undertaking.  Each Party shall
establish appropriate sanctions for violations of protective
orders or disclosure undertakings issued by or given to any
Party.  Each Party shall enforce such sanctions with respect to
any person within its jurisdiction.  Failure by a panelist to
sign a protective order or disclosure undertaking shall result in
disqualification of the panelist.

9.   If a panelist becomes unable to fulfill panel duties or is
disqualified, proceedings of the panel shall be suspended pending
the selection of a substitute panelist in accordance with the
procedures of this Annex. 

10.  Subject to the code of conduct established pursuant to
Article 1909, and provided that it does not interfere with the
performance of the duties of such panelist, a panelist may engage
in other business during the term of the panel. 

11.  While acting as a panelist, a panelist may not appear as
counsel before another panel. 

12.  With the exception of violations of protective orders or
disclosure undertakings, signed pursuant to paragraph 7,
panelists shall be immune from suit and legal process relating to
acts performed by them in their official capacity.

                    Panel Procedures Under Article 1903


1.   The panel shall establish its own rules of procedure unless
the Parties otherwise agree prior to the establishment of that
panel. The procedures shall ensure a right to at least one
hearing before the panel, as well as the opportunity to provide
written submissions and rebuttal arguments. The proceedings of
the panel shall be confidential, unless the two Parties otherwise
agree. The panel shall base its decisions solely upon the
arguments and submissions of the two Parties. 

2.   Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the panel shall, within
90 days after its chairman is appointed, present to the two
Parties an initial written declaratory opinion containing
findings of fact and its determination pursuant to Article 1903. 

3.   If the findings of the panel are affirmative, the panel may
include in its report its recommendations as to the means by
which the amending statute could be brought into conformity with
the provisions of Article 1902(2)(d).  In determining what, if
any, recommendations are appropriate, the panel shall consider
the extent to which the amending statute affects interests under
this Agreement.  Individual panelists may provide separate
opinions on matters not unanimously agreed.  The initial opinion
of the panel shall become the final declaratory opinion, unless a
Party to the dispute requests a reconsideration of the initial
opinion pursuant to paragraph 4. 

4.   Within 14 days of the issuance of the initial declaratory
opinion, a Party to the dispute disagreeing in whole or in part
with the opinion may present a written statement of its
objections and the reasons for those objections to the panel.  In
such event, the panel shall request the views of both Parties and
shall reconsider its initial opinion.  The panel shall conduct
any further examination that it deems appropriate, and shall
issue a final written opinion, together with dissenting or
concurring views of individual panelists, within 30 days of the
request for reconsideration. 

5.   Unless the Parties to the dispute otherwise agree, the final
declaratory opinion of the panel shall be made public, along with
any separate opinions of individual panelists and any written
views that either Party may wish to be published. 

6.   Unless the Parties to the dispute otherwise agree, meetings
and hearings of the panel shall take place at the office of the
amending Party's Section of the Secretariat.
                               ANNEX 1904.13

                     Extraordinary Challenge Procedure


1.   The involved Parties shall establish an extraordinary
challenge committee, composed of three members, within 15 days of
a request pursuant to Article 1904(13).  The members shall be
selected from a 15-person roster comprised of judges or former
judges of a federal judicial court of the United States or a
judicial court of superior jurisdiction of Canada, or a Federal
Judicial Court of Mexico.  Each Party shall name five persons to
this roster.  Each involved Party shall select one member from
this roster and the involved Partie's shall decide by lot which
of them shell select the third member from the roster. 

2.   The Parties shall establish by the date of entry into force
of the Agreement rules of procedure for committees.  The rules
shall provide for a decision of a committee within 90 days of its
establishment. 

3.   Committee decisions shall be binding on the Parties with
respect to the particular matter between the Parties that was
before the panel.  After examination of the legal and factual
analysis underlying the findings and conclusions of the panel's
decision in order to determine whether one of the grounds set out
in Article 1904(13) has been established, and upon finding that
one of those grounds has been established, the committee shall
vacate the original panel decision or remand it to the original
panel for action not inconsistent with the committee's decision;
if the grounds are not established, it shall deny the challenge
and, therefore, the original panel decision shall stand affirmed. 
If the original decision is vacated, a new panel shall be
established pursuant to Annex 1901.2.

equivalent to those available to that Party under this Agreement,
that Party shall notify any third Party of its intention.  If a
third Party wishes to have recourse to dispute settlement
procedures under this Agreement regarding the matter, it shall
inform promptly the notifying Party and those Parties shall
consult with a view to agreement on a single forum.  If those

5.   The responding Party shall deliver a copy of a request made
pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4 to the other Parties and to its
Section of the Secretariat.  Where the complaining Party has
initiated dispute settlement proceedings regarding any matter
subject to paragraph 3 or 4, the responding Party shall deliver

complaining Party on a mutually satisfactory resolution pursuant
to Article 2018(1) within 30 days of receiving the final report,
such complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party
complained against of benefits of equivalent effect until such
time as they have reached agreement on a resolution of the

 to be inconsistent with the obligations of this
 Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment
 by the non-complying Party in the sense of Annex 2004;

 same sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other
 sectors.

1.   For purposes of:

     (a) Part Two (Trade in Goods), except to the extent that a
 provision of that Part applies to services or
 investment, and

     (b) Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), except to the
 extent that a provision of that Part applies to

GATT Article XX and its interpretative notes, or any equivalent
provision of a successor agreement to which all Parties are
party, are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. 
The Parties understand that the measures referred to in GATT
Article XX(b) include environmental measures necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life or health, and that GATT Article
XX(g) applies to measures relating to the conservation of living
and non-living exhaustible natural resources.

2.   Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner that
would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between countries where the same conditions
prevail or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties,
nothing in:

     (a) Part Two (Trade in Goods), to the extent that a
 provision of that Part applies to services,

     (b) Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), to the extent
 that a provision of that Part applies to services,

3.   Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary
or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a disguised
restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in
Article 1106(1)(b) or (c) or (3)(a) or (b) (Performance
Requirements) shall be construed to prevent any Party from
adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental
measures:

     (a) necessary to secure compliance with laws and
 regulations that are not inconsistent with the
 provisions of this Agreement;

     (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or
 health; or

 exhaustible natural resources.


Article 2102: National Security

1.   Subject to Articles 607 (Energy) and 1018 (Government

 considers necessary for the protection of its essential
 security interests

 transactions in other goods, materials, services
 and technology undertaken directly or indirectly
 for the purpose of supplying a military or other
 security establishment,

     (ii) taken in time of war or other emergency in
 international relations, or

     (iii) relating to the implementation of national
 policies or international agreements

 the maintenance of international peace and security.


Article 2103: Taxation

1.   Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement
shall apply to taxation measures.

2.   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and
obligations of any Party under any tax convention.  In the event
of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and
any such convention, the provisions of that convention shall
prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2:

     (a) Article 301 (Market Access - National Treatment) and
 such other provisions of this Agreement as are
 necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply to
 taxation measures to the same extent as does Article
 III of the GATT, and

     (b) Article 315 (Market Access - Export Taxes) and Article
 604 (Energy - Export Taxes),

shall apply to taxation measures.

4.   Subject to paragraph 2:

     (a) Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services - National
 Treatment) and Article 1407 (Financial Services -
 National Treatment) shall apply to taxation measures on
 income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of
 corporations, and to those taxation measures set out in
 Annex 2103.4 that relate to the purchase or consumption
 of particular services, and

     (b) Articles 1102 and 1103 (Investment - National Treatment
 and MFN), Articles 1202 and 1203 (Cross-Border Trade in
 Services - National Treatment and MFN) and Articles
 1407 and 1408 (Financial Services - National Treatment
 and MFN) and shall apply to all taxation measures,
 other than those on income, capital gains or on the
 taxable capital of corporations and those taxes listed
 in Annex 2103.4,

except that nothing in those Articles shall apply

     (c) any most-favored-nation obligation with respect to an
 advantage accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax
 convention,

     (d) to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation
 measure,

     (e) to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-
 conforming provision of any existing taxation measure,

     (f) to an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any
 existing taxation measure to the extent that the
 amendment does not decrease its conformity, at the time
 of the amendment, with any of those Articles,

     (g) to any new taxation measure aimed at ensuring the
 equitable and effective imposition or collection of
 taxes and that does not arbitrarily discriminate
 between persons, goods or services of the Parties or
 arbitrarily nullify or impair benefits accorded under
 those Articles, in the sense of Annex 2004, or

     (h) to the measures set out in Annex 2103.4.

5.   Subject to paragraph 2 and without prejudice to the rights
and obligations of the Parties, Article 1106(3), (4), (5) and (6)
(Performance Requirements) shall apply to taxation measures.

6.   Article 1110 (Expropriation) shall apply to taxation
measures except that no investor may invoke that Article as the
basis for a claim under Article 1116 or 1117, where it has been
determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an
expropriation.  The investor shall refer the issue of whether the
measure is not an expropriation for a determination to the
appropriate competent authorities set out in Annex 2104.6 at the
time that it gives notice under Article 1119.  If the competent
authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed
to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an
expropriation within a period of six months after such referral,
the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article
1120.


Article 2104: Balance of Payments

1.   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from
adopting or maintaining measures that restrict international
transactions or related international transfers and payments
("transfers") where the Party experiences serious balance of
payments difficulties, or the threat thereof, and such
restrictions are:

     (a) consistent with paragraphs 4 through 8 when imposed on
 cross-border trade in financial services; or  

     (b) consistent with paragraphs 2 through 6 when imposed on
 any other transaction or transfer.  

2.   Restrictions imposed on transactions or transfers other than
cross-border trade in financial services shall:

     (a) when imposed on payments for current international
 transactions, be consistent with Article VIII(3) of the
 Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary
 Fund ("IMF");  

     (b) when imposed on international capital transactions, be
 consistent with Article VI of the Articles of Agreement
 of the IMF and imposed only in conjunction with
 measures imposed on current international transactions
 under paragraphs 2(a) and 4(a); and
     
     (c) when imposed on transfers covered by Article 1109
 (Investment - Transfers) and transfers related to trade
 in goods, be made in a freely usable currency at a
 market rate of exchange such that the payments and
 transfers are not substantially impeded.  

3.   No Party may adopt or maintain measures such as tariff
surcharges, quotas or licenses under this Article.

4.   As soon as practicable after imposing a restriction under
this Article, the Party imposing the restriction shall:

     (a) submit any current account exchange restrictions to the
 IMF for review under Article VIII of the Articles of
 Agreement of the IMF; and 

     (b) enter into good faith consultations with the IMF on
 economic adjustment measures to address the fundamental
 underlying economic problems causing the difficulties
 and receive endorsement of such measures by the IMF.

5.   Each Party shall ensure that any measure that it adopts or
maintains under this Article shall:

     (a) avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic
 and financial interests of another Party;

     (b) not be more burdensome than necessary to deal with the
 balance of payments difficulties or threat thereof;

     (c) be temporary and be phased out progressively as the
 situation improves; 

     (d) be consistent with any economic adjustment measures
 endorsed by the IMF under paragraph 4(b) and consistent
 with the Articles of Agreement of the IMF; and

 most-favored-nation treatment basis.

6.   A Party may adopt or maintain a measure under this Article
that gives priority to services which are more essential to its
economic program, provided that, except as specifically approved
under an IMF-endorsed adjustment program in effect under
paragraph 4, no such measure is imposed for the purpose of
protecting a specific industry or sector.

7.   A Party imposing a restriction on cross-border trade in
financial services shall:

     (a) not impose more than one measure on any given
 transaction and its related transfer, except as
 specifically approved under an IMF-endorsed adjustment
 program; 

     (b) promptly notify the other Parties; and

     (c) consult promptly with the other Parties to assess the
 balance of payments situation of the Party and the
 measures it has adopted, taking into account among

 situation of the Party adopting the measures.  


Article 2105: Disclosure of Information

Canadian" is an individual, government
or agency thereof or an entity which
is not "Canadian".

3.     In addition, specific
acquisitions or new businesses in
designated types of business
activities related to Canada's
cultural heritage or national
identity, which are normally
notifiable, may be reviewed if the
Governor in Council authorizes a
review in the public interest.

4.     Investments subject to review
under the Investment Canada Act are
not to be implemented unless the
Minister responsible for the
Investment Canada Act advises the
applicant that the investment is
likely to be of net benefit to Canada. 
Such a determination is made in
accordance with six factors described
in the Act.

5.     These factors are summarized as
follows: 

(a)  the effect of the investment on
  the level and nature of economic
  activity in Canada, including the
  effect on employment, on the
  utilization of parts, components
  and services produced in Canada,
  and on exports from Canada;

(b)  the degree and significance of
  participation by Canadians in the
  investment;

(c)  the effect of the investment on
  productivity, industrial
  efficiency, technological
  development and product
  innovation in Canada;

(d)  the effect of the investment on
  competition within any industry
  or industries in Canada;

(e)  the compatibility of the
  investment with national
  industrial, economic and cultural
  policies, taking into
  consideration industrial,
  economic and cultural policy
  objectives enunciated by the
  government or legislature of any
  province likely to be
  significantly affected by the
  investment; and 

(f)  the contribution of the
  investment to Canada's ability to
  compete in world markets.

6.     In making a net benefit
determination, the Minister, through
Investment Canada, may review plans
under which the applicant demonstrates
the net benefit to Canada of the
proposed acquisition.  An applicant
may also submit undertakings to the
Minister in connection with any
proposed acquisition which is the
subject of review.  In the event of
noncompliance with an undertaking by
an applicant, the Minister may seek a
court order directing compliance or
any other remedy authorized under the
Act.

7.     The establishment or acquisition
of Canadian businesses by non-
Canadians, other than those described
above, are to be notified to the
agency administering the Act,
Investment Canada.

8.     Review of "acquisition of
control", as defined in the Investment
Canada Act, of a Canadian business by
an American or Mexican will take place
if the value of the gross assets of
the Canadian business is not less than
the applicable thresholds, effective
on the date of entry into force of
this Agreement and adjusted on each
anniversary thereof.  The calculation
of the applicable review threshold is
set out in the Duration section below.

9.     The review threshold applicable
to American and Mexican investors is
higher than those set out above. 
However, this higher review threshold
does not apply in the following
sectors:  uranium production and
ownership of uranium producing
properties; oil and gas; financial
services; transportation services and
cultural businesses.

10.     Indirect "acquisitions of
control", as defined in the Investment
Canada Act, of Canadian businesses by
"American" and "Mexican" investors are
not reviewable.  Notwithstanding the
definition of "investor of a Party" in
Chapter Eleven, only investors who are
nationals, or entities controlled by
nationals, (as defined in the
Investment Canada Act) of the United
States or Mexico, may benefit from the
higher review threshold.

11.     Notwithstanding Article 1106(1),
Canada reserves the right to impose
requirements, or enforce any
commitment or undertaking, in
connection with the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, conduct or
operation of an investment of an
investor of another Party for the
transfer of technology, production
process or other proprietary knowledge
to a national or enterprise,
affiliated to the transferor, in
Canada, in connection with the review
of an acquisition of an investment
pursuant to the Investment Canada Act.

12.     Except for requirements,
commitments or undertakings related to
technology transfer as set out above,
Article 1106(1) shall apply to
requirements, commitments or
undertakings imposed or enforced under
the Investment Canada Act.  However,
Article 1106(1) shall not be construed
to apply to any requirement,
commitment or undertaking imposed or
enforced in connection with a review
under the Investment Canada Act, to
locate production, carry out research
and development, employ or train
workers, or to construct or expand
particular facilities, in Canada.

DURATION: Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the
Description setting out Canada's
reservations and commitments with
respect to Articles 1102,  1106(1),
and 1138 shall govern.

For American and Mexican investors,
the applicable threshold for the
review of a direct acquisition of
control of a Canadian business shall
be: 

(a)  for the twelve month period
  commencing on the date of entry
  into force of this Agreement,
  such monetary amount as
  determined in accordance with
  Annex 1607.3 of the Canada-United
  State Free Trade Agreement;

(b)  commencing on the first
  anniversary of the date of entry
  into force of this Agreement, the
  monetary amount for the preceding
  year multiplied by an annual
  adjustment representing the
  increase in nominal Gross
  Domestic Product, as set out
  below.

The calculation of the annual
adjustment shall be determined in
January of each year after 1994 using
the most recently available data as
published by Statistics Canada and
using the following formula: 

Ann                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ual Adjustment =

     Current nominal GDP at market
     prices
     ---------------------------------
    ----------------------Previous
    year nominal GDP at market prices

"Current nominal GDP at market prices"
means the arithmetic mean of the
nominal Gross Domestic Product at
market prices for the most recent four
consecutive quarters (seasonally
adjusted at annual rates).

"Previous year nominal GDP at market
prices" means the arithmetic mean of
the nominal Gross Domestic Product at
market prices for the four consecutive
quarters (seasonally adjusted at
annual rates) for the comparable
period in the year preceding the year
used in calculating the "current
nominal GDP at market prices".

The amounts determined in this manner
shall be rounded to the nearest
million dollars.

DESCRIPTION: Investment

The Canada Business Corporations Act
requires that a simple majority of
members of the board of directors, or
of a committee thereof, of a
federally-incorporated company must be
resident Canadians.  For the purposes
of the Act the term "resident
Canadian" is defined as an individual
who is a Canadian citizen ordinarily
resident in Canada, a citizen who is a
member of a class as set out in the
regulations, or a permanent resident
as defined in the Immigration Act
except a person who has been
ordinarily resident in Canada for more
than one year after he became eligible
to apply for Canadian citizenship.

In the case of a holding corporation,
not more than 1/3 of the directors
need be resident Canadians if the
earnings in Canada of the holding
corporation and its subsidiaries are
less than 5% of the gross earnings of
the holding corporation and its
subsidiaries.

Under the Canada Corporations Act, a
simple majority of the elected
directors of a Special Act corporation
must be residents of Canada and
citizens of a Commonwealth country. 
This requirement applies to every
joint stock company incorporated
subsequent to 22 June 1869 by any
Special Act of Parliament and any
subsequent amendments to such Acts.

DESCRIPTION: Investment

Canadian legislation contains certain
qualifications for holders of oil and
gas production licenses for
discoveries made after March 5, 1982. 
These qualifications ensure that
holders of such licenses, or shares
therein, are Canadian citizens
ordinarily resident in Canada,
permanent residents or corporations
incorporated in Canada.

Notwithstanding qualification to hold
a production license, no production
license shall be issued for
discoveries made after March 5, 1982
unless the Minister of Energy, Mines
and Resources is satisfied that the
Canadian ownership rate of the
interest-owner in relation to the
production license on the date of
issuance would not be less than 50%.
"Interest-owner" is defined in the
Canada Petroleum Resources Act to mean
"an interest holder who holds the
interest or a group of interest
holders who hold all the shares of the
interest".

With respect to production licenses
for discoveries made prior to March 5,
1982, the Canadian ownership
requirements are as set out in the
Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.

These qualifications and Canadian
ownership requirements are in respect
of production licenses issued on
"frontier lands" and the "offshore
areas" (areas not under provincial
jurisdiction) as defined in the
legislation.

transshipment of fish catches, only to
fishing vessels from countries with
which it has favorable fishery
relations, based primarily on

The following "commercial air
services" are reserved to Canadian air
carriers or operators:  domestic air
transportation services (cabotage);
international scheduled air
transportation services reserved by
bilateral agreements to Canadian
airlines; and international
non-scheduled air transportation
services between Canada and a country
other than a foreign air carrier's
state of registry ("fifth freedom
charters").  For specialty air
services, see Schedule of Canada,
Annex I, p.I-C-42 and Schedule of
Canada, Annex II, p.II-C-9.

Only qualified persons may provide
commercial air services reserved to
Canadian air carriers or operators. 
Non-Canadian investment in voting
stock of enterprises providing
commercial air services that are
reserved to Canadian air carriers or
operators is limited to 25% or to a
lesser percentage where control in
fact of the enterprise is otherwise
considered not to be held by
Canadians.  Non-Canadians are not
permitted, through voting interests or
other forms of investment, to control
Canadian air carriers or operators. 
Aircraft other than state aircraft may
only be registered in Canada by
qualified persons.  Aircraft not
registered in Canada are limited by
regulation concerning the period
during which they may be operated in
Canada by Canadians.

A qualified person is a Canadian
citizen or permanent resident, or a
corporation incorporated by or under
the laws of Canada or a province and
of which: 

(a)  not less than 75 % of the voting
  interest is in fact owned and
  controlled by Canadian citizens
  or permanent residents or by a
  corporation meeting the
  requirements on Canadian
  ownership and control;

(b)  not less than 2/3 of its
  directors are Canadian citizens
  or permanent residents;

(c)  the executive head is a Canadian
  citizen or permanent resident;
  and

(d)  the principal place of business
  is in Canada.

A corporation incorporated by or under
the laws of Canada or a province but
that does not meet the Canadian
ownership and control requirements may
only register a private aircraft when
the corporation is the sole owner and
subject to other limitations and
requirements of the Air Regulations.

The Air Regulations also have the
effect of limiting "non-Canadian"
corporations operating foreign
registered private aircraft within
Canada to the carriage of their own
employees. A "non-Canadian"
corporation is a corporation which
does not meet the Canadian ownership
and control requirements.

All commercial air services operating
in Canada require a Canadian operating
certificate to ensure their safety and
security.  An operating certificate
authorizing the provision of
commercial air services reserved to
Canadian operators or air carriers is
only issued to qualified persons.

disadvantaged individuals or groups
have access to training and employment
opportunities or can participate in

  activity in the offshore area the
  corporation or other body
  submitting the plan shall
  establish in the Province an
  office where appropriate levels
  of decision-making are to take
  place;

(b)  expenditures shall be made for
  research and development to be
  carried out in the Province, and
  for education and training to be
  provided in the Province; and

(c)  first consideration shall be
  given to goods produced or
  services provided from within the
  Province, where those goods or
  services are competitive in terms
  of fair market price, quality and
  delivery.

4.     The Boards administering the
benefits plan under these Acts may
also require that the plan include
provisions to ensure that
disadvantaged individuals or groups or
corporations owned or cooperatives
operated by them participate in the
supply of goods and services used in
any proposed work or activity referred
in the benefits plan.

5.     In addition, Canada reserves the
right to impose any requirement or
enforce any commitment or undertaking
for the transfer of technology, a
production process or other
proprietary knowledge to a national or
enterprise in Canada, in connection
with the approval of development
projects under the Acts cited above.
DURATION: For purposes of this entry, paragraph
5 of the Description shall govern with
respect to Canada's reservation to the
obligations of Article 1106(1) (f).

For purposes of this entry, the Yukon
Oil and Gas Accord and the Northwest
Territories Oil and Gas Accord shall
be deemed to be existing measures,
upon completion of their negotiation.

through trust the title to real estate
intended for industrial and tourist
activities in the Restricted Zone for
a period not to exceed 30 years.

The trust is renewable if:  

(a)  The beneficiaries of the trust
  which is to be extinguished or
  terminated will be beneficiaries
  of the new trust;

(b)  the new trust is to be executed
  under the same terms and
  conditions as the trust which is
  to be extinguished or terminated,
  in respect of the purposes of the
  trust, the use of real estate and
  its characteristics; 


(c)  the respective permits are

                            Schedule of Mexico


TRANSITIONAL EXCEPTIONS

Reservations to Articles 1404 and 1407

1.   The provisions of paragraphs 2 through 10 of this Part B of
the Schedule of Mexico shall apply during the Transition Period,
except as otherwise specifically provided in paragraphs 9 and 10
of this Part B.

2.   For the types of financial institutions listed in the chart
in this paragraph 2, the maximum capital to be authorized for a
Foreign Financial Affiliate, measured as a percentage of the
aggregate capital of all financial institutions of the same type
in Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the chart
in this paragraph 2: 

     Type of Financial Institution Maximum Individual Capital to
 be Authorized (Percentage of
 the Aggregate Capital of all
 Institutions of the same type) 
            

     Commercial Banks                             1.5%
     Securities Firms                             4.0%
     Insurance Companies
         Casualty                                 1.5%
         Life and Health                          1.5%

In the case of an acquisition by a financial service provider of
another Party of a financial institution established in Mexico,
the sum of the authorized capital of the acquired institution and
the authorized capital of any Foreign Financial Affiliate already
controlled by the acquiror may not, at the time of acquisition or
at any time thereafter during the Transition Period, exceed the
applicable limit set forth in the chart in this paragraph 2.

This paragraph 2 will not apply to new or existing Mexican
insurance companies invested in by insurance providers of another
Party (or their affiliates) pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Part
3 or paragraph 4 of Part C of the Schedule of Mexico.

3.   For purposes of the proper administration of the capital
limits in the Schedule of Mexico, the following provisions shall
apply: 

     i.   Each Foreign Financial Affiliate shall have a paid-in
capital not less than that authorized by Mexico at the time of
approval of its establishment.  The authorized capital shall be
determined by Mexico.  After the time of establishment, Mexico
may permit authorized capital to exceed paid-in capital. 
Authorized capital shall not be reduced by any measure of Mexico
(other than prudential measures) below paid-in capital.  The
maximum size of the operations of each Foreign Financial
Affiliate shall be determined, on a national treatment basis, as
a function of the lesser of its capital or its authorized
capital.

     ii.  Mexico reserves the right to impose limitations on
transfers of assets or liabilities by Foreign Financial
Affiliates that have the effect of evading the capital limits set
forth in the Schedule of Mexico.  This subparagraph does not
apply to bona fide transfers of funds to make overnight deposits
or bona fide transfers of banking liabilities.

4.   A Foreign Financial Affiliate shall not issue subordinated
debentures, except to its parent outside of Mexico.  

5.   The aggregate of the authorized capital of all Foreign
Financial Affiliates of the same type, measured as a percentage
of the aggregate capital of all financial institutions of such
type in Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the
chart in this paragraph 5 for that type of institution, except
for the case of insurance which is addressed in paragraph 6 of
this Part B.  Beginning one year after the entry into force of
the Agreement, these initial limits shall increase annually in
equal increments so as to reach the final limits specified in the
chart in this paragraph 5 at the beginning of the last year of
the Transition Period.  


Type of Financial Institution   Percentage of Total Capital
                               Initial   Final
                               Limit          Limit

     Commercial banks                 8%            15%
     Securities firms                10%            20%
     Factoring companies             10%            20%
     Leasing companies               10%            20%

Any capital in existence as of the date of signature of this
Agreement of a foreign bank branch established in Mexico prior to
such date shall be excluded from each of the aggregate capital
limits referred to in the Schedule of Mexico.  

6.   In the case of insurance, the aggregate of the authorized
capital of all Foreign Insurance Affiliates, measured as a
percentage of the aggregate capital of all insurance companies in
Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the chart in
this paragraph 6 for the respective one-year periods beginning on
each of the following dates: 

          Date                     Percentage of Total Capital

     January 1, 1994                            6%
     January 1, 1995                            8%
     January 1, 1996                            9%
     January 1, 1997                           10%
     January 1, 1998                           11%
     January 1, 1999                           12%

If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a date prior
to January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial date for
purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary of the
entry into force of the Agreement shall become the next
succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages listed in
this chart applying to each of the respective periods as so
adjusted.  If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a
date after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in
this chart shall nonetheless not be changed.

The individual and aggregate capital limits described in
paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B shall be measured separately
(through separate accounting) for life and non-life insurance
operations; but both types of insurance operations may be
conducted either by a single or separate Foreign Financial
Affiliates.  

7.   Insurance providers of another Party may elect an
alternative procedure for entering Mexico through phasing-in an
equity interest in a new or existing Mexican insurance company,
and thereby exempt such Mexican company from the capital limits
of paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B.  In order to qualify, the
percentage of the Mexican insurance company's voting common stock
that is owned by Mexican persons must not be less than the levels
set forth in the chart in this paragraph 7 for the respective
one-year periods beginning on each of the following dates: 

          Date                Mexican Interest

     January 1, 1994                 70%
     January 1, 1995                 65%
     January 1, 1996                 60%
     January 1, 1997                 55%
     January 1, 1998                 49%
     January 1, 1999                 25%

If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a date prior
to January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial date for
purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary of the
entry into force of the Agreement shall become the next
succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages listed in
this chart applying to each of the respective periods as so
adjusted.  If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a
date after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in
this chart shall nonetheless not be changed.

On and after January 1, 2000 (or, if the entry into force of the
Agreement occurs on a date prior to January 1, 1994, on and after
the sixth anniversary of such date), the percentage requirement
of Mexican ownership set forth in this paragraph 7 shall no
longer apply.

This paragraph 7 is further modified by paragraph 4 of Part C of
the Schedule of Mexico to the extent set forth therein.  

8.   The aggregate assets of Foreign Financial Affiliates that
are limited scope financial institutions within the meaning of
paragraph 2 of Part C of the Schedule of Mexico shall not exceed
3% of the sum of (1) the aggregate assets of all commercial banks
in Mexico plus (2) the aggregate assets of all types of limited
scope financial institutions in Mexico.  Lending by affiliates of
automobile manufacturing companies with respect to their vehicles
shall not be subject to or taken into account in determining
compliance with this 3% limit.  

9.   The capital limits in paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 8 of this Part
B shall be removed at the end of the Transition Period.  If the
sum of the authorized capital of Foreign Financial Affiliates,
measured as a percentage of the aggregate capital of all
financial institutions of such type in Mexico, reaches the
percentage set forth in the chart in this paragraph 9 for such
type of institutions, then Mexico shall have the right, once
during the four years following the end of the Transition Period,
to freeze such aggregate capital percentage at its then-existing
level: 

     Commercial banks                    25%
     Securities firms                    30%

If applied, such a restriction will have a duration not to exceed
a period of 3 years.  

10.  No additional license to establish a Foreign Financial
Affiliate shall be granted during the Transition Period (and, in
the case of paragraph 9 of this Part B, during the additional
periods described in that paragraph) if after such issuance the
sum of the authorized capital of all Foreign Financial Affiliates
of the same type would exceed the applicable percentage limit for
that type of institution in paragraph 5, 6, 8 or 9 of this
Part B. 


OTHER EXCEPTIONS

11.  The provisions of the following paragraphs 12 through 15 of
this Part B shall apply immediately upon the entry into force of
the Agreement and at all times thereafter, except as otherwise
specifically provided in such paragraphs.  Any amendment or
modification to a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to
paragraphs 12 through 15 of this Part B shall not decrease the
conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before such
amendment or modification, with Articles 1404 to 1409 of the
Agreement.

Reservation to Article 1407

12.  Mexico may require that a Foreign Financial Affiliate (other
than a Foreign Insurance Affiliate) be wholly-owned by a
financial service provider of another Party (except for
directors' nominal qualifying shares).  Mexico may also restrict
any Foreign Financial Affiliate from establishing agencies,
branches, or other direct or indirect subsidiaries in the
territory of any other country.  

Reservations to Articles 1404 and 1407

13.  Following the Transition Period, acquisition of a commercial
bank established in Mexico, or of the assets or liabilities
thereof, by a financial service provider of another Party will
only be authorized by Mexico, subject to reasonable prudential
considerations on a case by case basis, if the sum of the
authorized capital of the acquired commercial bank and the
authorized capital of any commercial bank in Mexico already
controlled by the acquiror would not exceed 4% of the aggregate
capital of all commercial banks in Mexico.  

14.  Mexico may adopt measures that (i) limit eligibility to
establish a Foreign Financial Affiliate in Mexico to a financial
service provider of another Party that is, directly or through
any of its affiliates, engaged in the same general type of
financial services in the territory of the other Party; and (ii)
limit such provider (together with its affiliates) to no more
than one institution of the same type in Mexico.  In determining
what types of operations a financial service provider of another
Party is engaged in for purposes of the preceding sentence, all
types of insurance shall be considered to be only one type of
financial service; but both life and non-life insurance
operations may be conducted either by a single or separate
Foreign Financial Affiliates.  

Reservation to Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407

15.  The existing activities and operations of Mexican
governmental insurance programs conducted by Aseguradora
Mexicana, S.A. or Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A. (including insurance
for government employees, agencies, instrumentalities and public
entities) are excluded from Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407 for so
long as such firm is controlled by the government of Mexico and
for a commercially reasonable time after such governmental
control ceases.

Reservation to Article 1405

16.  In order not to impair the conduct of Mexico's monetary and
exchange rate policies, non-resident financial service providers
of another Party shall not be permitted to provide financial
services into the territory of Mexico or to residents of Mexico,
and residents of Mexico may not purchase financial services from
non-resident financial service providers of another Party, if
such transactions are denominated in Mexican pesos.  

Reservation to Articles 1404-1409

17.  The benefits of this Agreement shall not be extended to a
foreign bank branch existing in Mexico on the date of entry into
force of this Agreement.  The existing legal regime will continue
to apply to such a branch for so long as it operates in that
form.  Such a branch shall be permitted to convert to a
subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Schedule, and upon
conversion shall be covered by this Agreement.  The existing
capital of such branch on the date of signature of this Agreement
shall not be counted against such Foreign Commercial Bank
Affiliate's individual capital limit, or the aggregate capital
limits for commercial banks in the event of conversion.

                            Schedule of Mexico


SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS

1.   Mexico shall retain discretion to approve, on a case-by-case
basis, any affiliation of a commercial bank or securities firm
with a commercial or industrial corporation that has a commercial
presence in Mexico, if Mexico determines that such affiliation is
harmless and, in the case of banking, either (a) not substantial,
or (b) the financial-related activities of the commercial or
industrial commercial corporation are at least 90 percent of its
annual income worldwide, and the non-financial activities of such
commercial or industrial corporation are of a type that Mexico
determines to be acceptable.  Affiliation with a non-resident
commercial or industrial corporation that has no commercial
presence in Mexico will not be a reason for denial of an
application to establish or acquire a commercial bank or
securities firm in Mexico.

2.   Non-bank financial service providers of another Party shall
be permitted to establish one or more limited scope financial
institutions in Mexico to provide separately consumer lending,
commercial lending, mortgage lending or credit card services on
terms no less favorable than those applied to like domestic firms
under Mexican measures.  Mexico may permit lending services
closely related to the principal authorized business of a limited
scope financial institution to be carried out by that
institution.  Such firms shall be provided the opportunity to
raise funds in the securities market for business operations
subject to normal terms and conditions.  Mexico may restrict such
limited scope financial institutions from taking deposits.

3.   Within two years of the entry into force of the Agreement,
Mexico shall conduct a study of the desirability and, if
desirable, the possible methods of establishing limited scope
securities firms which would have more limited powers than
current securities firms.  Such limited scope securities firms
would be subject to differing capital requirements, depending on
the type and extent of business conducted, that would permit
lower minimum capital requirements than those currently
applicable to Mexican securities firms.  The basis of the study
would be prudential considerations and opportunities for
investment in the securities sector.  As part of the second
annual meeting of the Committee required under Article 1414, 
Mexico shall report to the other Parties on the outcome of the
study, including any plans for the establishment of new
categories of securities firms.

4.   Notwithstanding Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of
Mexico, an insurance provider of another Party, together with its
affiliates, that as of July 1, 1992 collectively have an active
investment or ownership interest that has been specifically
approved by the Mexico of 10% or more in a Mexican insurance
company may:  (1) exercise any contract right or option in
existence as of July 1, 1992 with respect to ownership interests
in such Mexican insurance company; and (2) effective the earlier
of January 1, 1996 or two years following the date of entry into
force of the Agreement, acquire a controlling interest of up to
100% in such Mexican insurance company.  Before the effective
date described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence, an
insurance provider of another Party (together with its
affiliates) described in that sentence may exercise any existing
contract right or option described in clause (1) of that
sentence, and choose to maintain its existing interest or expand
its interest in such Mexican insurance company to the extent
consistent with Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of Mexico. 
Mexico shall maintain discretion to permit acceleration of the
schedule for equity participation in a Mexican insurance company
by an insurance provider of another Party described in the first
sentence of this paragraph.

5.   A bank or securities provider of another Party that is
authorized to and establishes or acquires a commercial bank or
securities firm, respectively, in Mexico may also establish a
financial holding company in Mexico, and thereby establish or
acquire other types of financial institutions in Mexico, under
the terms of Mexican measures.

6.   Mexico shall administer its licensing and approval
procedures during the Transition Period (as defined in Part B of
the Schedule of Mexico) in a manner that does not deny the
benefits of the liberalization of existing measures described in
the Schedule of Mexico to enterprises of another Party ultimately
controlled by nationals of that Party.

DESCRIPTION: Cross-Border Services

Title III of the Export Trading
Company Act of 1982 authorizes the
Secretary of Commerce to issue
"certificates of review" with respect
to export conduct.  The Act calls for
the issuance of a certificate of
review if the Secretary determines,
and the Attorney General concurs, that
the export conduct specified in an
application will not have the
anticompetitive effects proscribed by
the Act.  A certificate of review
limits the liability under federal and
state antitrust laws in engaging in
the export conduct certified.

Only a "person" as defined by the Act
can apply for a certificate of review. 
The term "person" means "an individual
who is a resident of the United
States; a partnership that is created
under and exists pursuant to the laws
of any State or of the United States;
a State or local government entity; a
corporation, whether organized as a
profit or nonprofit corporation, that
is created under and exists pursuant
to the laws of any State or of the
United States; or any association or
combination, by contract or other
arrangement, between such persons."

A foreign national or enterprise can
receive the protection provided by a
certificate of review by becoming a
"member" of a qualified applicant. 
The regulations define "member" to
mean "an entity (U.S. or foreign)
which is seeking protection under the
certificate with the applicant.  A
member may be a partner in a
partnership or a joint venture; a
shareholder of a corporation; or a
participant in an association,
cooperative, or other form of profit
or nonprofit organization or
relationship, by contract or other
arrangement."

documentation and is generally
available for use by all persons.

An application for a validated license
may be made only by a person subject
to the jurisdiction of the United
States who is in fact the exporter, or
by his duly authorized agent.  An

person not subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States by an authorized
agent in the United States, who then

percent of the voting interest in the
corporation is owned or controlled by
U.S. citizens. 49 U.S.C. App.
1301(16).    

In addition, this statutory
requirement has historically been
interpreted by the Department of
Transportation (and the Civil
Aeronautics Board before it) to
require that an air carrier in fact be
under the actual control of U.S.
citizens.  The Department of
Transportation makes this
determination on a case-by-case basis. 
Nevertheless, the Department has
provided guidance as to some lines of
demarcation.  For example, total
foreign equity investment of up to 49
percent (with a maximum of 25 percent
being voting stock), taken alone, is
not construed as indicative of foreign
control.  (See Department of
Transportation Order 91-1-41, January
23, 1991.)

Only air carriers that are U.S.
citizens are permitted to operate
domestic air services or operate
international air services as a "U.S."
carrier;  non-U.S. citizens may own
and control foreign air carriers that
operate between the U.S. and foreign
points.  See Sections 401, 402,
417(b)(7) and 1108 of the Federal
Aviation Act.  The different rights of
each type of air carrier are usually
spelled out in the applicable aviation
bilateral agreement.

Certain distinctions based on
citizenship also exist with regard to
other types of air services providers,
such as air freight forwarders (14
C.F.R. 297), charter operators (14
C.F.R. 380), and intermodal operators
(14 C.F.R. 222).    

Air freight forwarders may be "U.S.
citizens" (defined as indicated above)
which use the services of (inter alia)
direct air carriers (with a Department
of Transportation certificate,
regulation, order or permit) to
transport property. 14 C.F.R. Part
296.  They may also be "foreign air
freight forwarders", which similarly
use direct air carriers to transport
property.  14 C.F.R. Part 296.  There
is no "U.S. citizenship" requirement
for "foreign air freight forwarders." 
14 C.F.R. 297.3(d).  Foreign air
freight forwarders may obtain the same
operating exemptions available to U.S.
citizens.  They must, however, apply
for registration with the Department
of Transportation.  Their application
can be rejected "for reasons relating
to the failure of effective
reciprocity, or if the Department
finds that it is in the public
interest to do so."  14 C.F.R.
297.22.                                   

Charter operators may be "public
charter operators", which inter alia
must be "U.S. citizens" (defined as
indicated above) or "foreign charter
operators," for which there is not a
citizenship requirement.  14 C.F.R.
380.2.  Unlike domestic charter
operators, "foreign charter operators"
wishing to operate charters which
originate in the U.S. must register
with the Department of Transportation. 
14 C.F.R. 380.61.  The Department of
Transportation may reject a
registration application "for reasons
relating to the failure of effective
reciprocity or if the Department finds
it would be in the public interest to
do so."  14 C.F.R.  380.64.  

A direct foreign air carrier may
engage in the surface transport of
property (which it has carried by air)
in a zone extending 35 miles from the
boundary of the airport or city it is
authorized to serve.  There is no such
geographic limitation on a direct U.S.
air carrier, or on a U.S. or foreign
indirect air carrier.

DESCRIPTION: Cross-Border Services

Operating authority from the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
is required to provide interstate or
cross border bus or truck services in
the territory of the United States.  A
moratorium has been imposed on new
grants of operating authority for
persons of Mexico, except for
provision of cross-border charter or
tour bus services.

Under the moratorium, persons of
Mexico without operating authority may
operate only within ICC Border
Commercial Zones, for which ICC
operating authority is not required. 
Persons of Mexico providing truck
services (including for hire, private,
and exempt services) without operating
authority are required to obtain a
certificate of registration from the
ICC to enter the United States and
operate in the ICC Border Commercial
Zones.  Persons of Mexico providing
bus service are not required to obtain
an ICC certificate of registration to
provide such service within the ICC
Border Commercial Zones.

A person providing bus or truck
service between points in the United
States is required to use United
States-registered and either U.S.-
built or duty-paid equipment.

Investment

The moratorium has the effect of being
an investment restriction because
enterprises of the United States
providing bus or truck services that
are owned or controlled by persons of
Mexico may not obtain ICC operating
authority.

DURATION: On entry into force of this Agreement, the Description shall govern.
          Cross-Border Services

A person of Mexico will be permitted
to obtain operating authority to
provide:

(a)  three years after signature of
  this Agreement, cross-border
  truck services to or from border
  states (California, Arizona, New
  Mexico, and Texas), and such
  persons will be permitted to
  enter and depart the territory of
  United States through different
  ports of entry;

(b)  three years after entry into
  force of this Agreement,
  cross-border scheduled bus
  services; and

(c)  six years after entry into force
  of this Agreement, cross-border
  truck services.


Investment

A person of Mexico will be permitted
to establish an enterprise in the
United States to provide:

(a)  three years after signature of
  this Agreement, truck services
  for the distribution of
  international cargo between
  points in the United States; and

(b)  seven years after entry into
  force of this Agreement, bus
  services between points in the
  United States.

Indeterminate:  The moratorium will
remain in place on grants of authority
for the provision of truck services by
persons of Mexico between points in
the United States for the
transportation of goods other than
international cargo.

     The United States takes an exception to Article 1103 for all
international agreements (bilateral and multilateral) in force or
signed prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
     
     As for international agreements other than those in force or
signed prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement,
the United States takes an exception to Article 1103 for those
agreements involving:

1.   Aviation;

2.   Fisheries;

3.   Maritime matters, including salvage; or

4.   Telecommunications.

     With respect to state measures not yet described in Annex I,
pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 1108, the United States takes
an exception to Article 1103 for international agreements signed
within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement.

     For greater certainty, the Parties note that Article 1103

                and Title III, 47 U.S.C. 151 et. seq. (1988)

DESCRIPTION: The Communications Act of 1934 (the
Act) requires anyone wishing to engage
in communications by radio within the
United States and between the United
States and points outside the United
States to obtain a license from the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) for the use, but not the
ownership, of all channels of radio
communications; and no such license
shall be construed to create any right
beyond the terms, conditions and
periods of the license.

The Act requires the FCC, in granting
radio station licenses, to determine
if such a license would serve the
public interest, convenience and
necessity and empowers the FCC to
impose conditions pursuant to this
determination.  The Act also empowers
the FCC to deny applications for radio
licenses where it is unable to find
that such grant would serve the public
interest, convenience and necessity.

		47 C.F.R. 76.501, 74.931(e)(5),
		63.54, and 21.912

DESCRIPTION: A cable television system is not
allowed to carry any television
broadcast signal if the cable system
owns, operates, controls or has an
interest in a television broadcast
station whose Grade B contour overlaps
the service area of such cable system.
(76.501(a))

A cable television system may directly
or indirectly own, operate, control,
or have an interest in a national
television network (such as ABC, CBS,
or NBC) only if such system does not
pass more than (i) 10 percent of homes
passed on a nationwide basis when
aggregated with all other cable
systems in which the network holds
such a cognizable interest, and (ii)
50 percent of homes passed within any
one ADI (Arbitron Area of Dominant
Influence), except that a cable
television system facing a competing
system will not be counted toward this
50 percent limit. (76.501(b))

A cable television company may not
lease excess transmission time or
capacity from a licensee of an
Instructional Television Fixed Service
(ITFS) station (television services
intended for use in educational
institutions) if the ITFS station is
located within 20 miles of that cable
television company's franchise area.
(74.931(e)(5))

A telephone common carrier may not
engage in the provision (e.g.,
ownership, control, or production) of
video programming to the viewing
public in its telephone service area,
but may distribute such programming on
a common carrier basis and may only
have up to a five percent non-
controlling financial interest in
video programmers. (63.54(a))

A telephone common carrier may not
provide channels of communications or
pole line conduit space, or other
rental arrangements to any entity
which is directly or indirectly owned,
operated or controlled by, or under
common control with, such telephone
common carrier, where such facilities
or arrangements are to be used for, or
in connection with, the provision of
video programming to the viewing
public in the telephone service area
of the telephone common carrier.
(63.54(b))

In cable television franchise areas
served by a single cable operator,
that operator may not be authorized to
use frequencies assigned to the
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution
Service (MMDS) (the 2150-2165 Mhz and
2596-2644 Mhz bands), if a portion of
an MMDS station's protected service
area lies within that cable television
operator's franchise area. (21.912)

		18 C.F.R. part 157

DESCRIPTION: Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act of
1938, as amended, requires a natural
gas company, or a person which will be
a natural gas company upon completion
of proposed construction or extension
of transportation facilities, to
obtain a certificate of public
convenience and necessity to
construct, extend, acquire, or operate
such facilities.  In addition, a
certificate is required to transport
or sell for resale natural gas in
interstate commerce.

The Act requires the FERC to hold
hearings on applications for permanent
certificates and to give interested
persons notice of such hearings and
notices of applications are published
in the Federal Register.

The FERC does not require a
certificate of pubic convenience and
necessity for certain replacement
construction, maintenance, emergency
facilities, auxiliary installations,
and certain types of taps.

Natural gas services for drilling oil
wells, or for testing or purging new
natural gas pipeline facilities are
exempt from the certificate
requirement.

Certain "emergency" sales,
transportation, or exchanges are
exempt from the certificate
requirement.  When a certificate is
required, the FERC may grant a
temporary certificate for sale or
transportation in emergency
circumstances, pending the
determination on a permanent
certificate.

DESCRIPTION: The United States Postal Service is
generally authorized to "receive,
transmit, and deliver throughout the
United States, its territories and
possessions ... written and printed
matter, parcels and like materials." 
The Postal Service also has the
exclusive authority to "provide and
sell postage stamps."

A carrier other than the U.S. Postal
Service may carry letters if, among
other things, each letter is enclosed
in an envelope, proper postage has
been paid in stamps, the stamp is
canceled by the sender, and the
carrier endorses the envelope.

The postal regulations define
"letters" to exclude telegrams, books
and magazines, and other materials. 
The regulations also permit letters to
be carried accompanying cargo, by the
sender, by others without
compensation, and by special
messengers.  The Postal Service has
suspended its regulations with respect
to private "express mail" services.

DESCRIPTION: A concession is required to operate
hotels, restaurants, gift shops, snack
bars, equipment rentals, horseback
riding services, guide services,
fishing guides, mountain climbing, bus
transportation, and other services
facilities in U.S. national parks. 
The National Park Service regulates
all aspects of these services,
including building specifications,
rates for the services, and hours of
operation.

The National Park Service awards
concessions only where they are
determined to be "necessary and
appropriate."  In developing its plans
for the operation of a national park,
the Park Service determines what
operations, including concessions, are
"necessary and appropriate."  As a
result of this determination, the Park
Service may determine that a given
concession is not needed.

LEGAL CITATION: Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
		Sections 309, 325, 47 U.S.C. 309, 325 (1988)

DESCRIPTION: The United States will ensure that in
considering applications for a grant
of authority to transmit programming
to foreign stations for retransmission
into the United States under Section
325 of the Communications Act of 1934
(the Act), the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) will not consider the
nationality of the affected stations
for the purpose of favoring a U.S.
station that is competing with a
Mexican station for affiliation with a
U.S. programmer. Rather the FCC will
apply the criteria for the grant of
such permit in the same manner as
would be applied to a domestic
broadcast station application under
Section 309 of the Act. 

In addition, the term of the Section
325 permit shall be extended from one
year to five years in all situations
where it can be assured that the
retransmitting station is and will be
in full compliance with applicable
treaties. In assessing the public
interest, convenience, and necessity
required by the Act for the grant of
authorization under Section 325, the
primary criterion will be avoiding the
creation or maintenance of electrical
interference to U.S. broadcast
stations that violates applicable
treaty provisions. In evaluating this
and any other criteria permitted under
Section 309, the U.S. will ensure that
the Section 325 process shall not be
conducted in a manner that would
constitute an unnecessary restriction
on trade.

		amended, 12 U.S.C.  3103(a)(5).

DESCRIPTION: Federal authorities may not approve
the establishment of, or acquisition
of an interest in, a bank subsidiary
within a state ("the host state") by a
foreign bank that has a full-service
branch or bank subsidiary in the
United States, unless the measures of
the host state expressly permit the
transaction.  Thus, foreign banks may
not acquire interests in banks in some
states on the same basis as domestic
bank holding companies from the
foreign bank's home state.  For
purposes of determining national
treatment under paragraph 6(b) of
Article 1407, foreign banks are
located in their "home state," as that
term is used in the International
Banking Act of 1978.

The following types of measures, inter
alia, fall into this category: 

     (a) Foreign banks are expressly
 excluded from the authority
 to own banks in certain
 regional holding company
 laws.

     (b) Foreign banks
 are implicitly excluded through a
definition of eligible owner
in certain state laws that
requires a majority of the
parent bank's deposits to be
in the United States, in a
particular region of the
United States, or in a
particular state.

     (c) Foreign banks
 that do not already own a
 banking subsidiary in
 the United States are
 interpreted as not qualifying
 as an eligible "bank holding
 company" entitled to own
 a bank.
