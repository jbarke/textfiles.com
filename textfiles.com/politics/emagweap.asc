       CONFERENCE NOTE: Sixty-five-year-old economist LYNDON H. LA
                        ROUCHE, JR.   is   a   candidate   for   the   1988
                        presidential nomination  of  the  Democratic  Party
                        (U.S.A.).
                        He is  best  known  in  military  science  for  his
                        leading international  role,  during 1982 and early
                        1983, in  proposing   a  western  global  strategic
                        ballistic missile defense based upon  "new physical
                        principles."
         ================================================================

            During the  past two years, there has been increasing attention
       to the imminently dominant role of  new  types  of  electromagnetic-
       pulse weapons as strategic and tactical assault weapons  of  general
       warfare.

            Unfortunately, most  of  this  discussion has been listed under
       the somewhat misleading title of "radio-frequency  weapons,"  a name
       carried over from earlier years discussions of more  primitive forms
       of electronic warfare.

            One of  our  greatest  difficulties  in  explaining  these  new
       dimensions of warfare, is the popularity  of  the  old opinion, that
       microwaves might impair  or  destroy  living  tissues  by  inductive
       heating.

            Unquestionably, microwaves  can do this, but we are speaking of
       lethal and other special effects achieved  by a deposit of energy on
       target even several orders of magnitude less than required  to  cook
       that tissue to death.

            The new  class  of  electromagnetic-pulse  weaponry  has  other
       military applications, in addition to uses as strategic and tactical
       anti-personnel assault-weapons. Missions for non-organic targets

       include increasingly sophisticated  methods  for rendering equipment
       inoperative or dysfunctional;  they   include  efficient  means  for
       disrupting the structure of materials.

            However, general policy for the field as a whole  can be fairly
       discussed by limiting  our  attention  to  the case of strategic and
       tactical anti-personnel assault weapons.

                          A Branch of Optical Biophysics
                         ------------------------------

            It is singularly appropriate  that  a  discussion of this field
       should occur in Milan, since it was here that the science of optical
       biophysics was born about five hundred years ago, as an outgrowth of
       the collaboration between Fra Luca Pacioli and Leonardo da Vinci.

            It is also to be stressed, that the founding of modern physical
       science and biology, by that collaboration, was the outgrowth of the
       pioneering work in establishing the methods of physical  science  by
       the great Cardinal  Nicolaus of Cusa, the Cusa whose writings served
       as the starting-point for the collaboration of Pacioli and Cusa.

            The connection between the  work  of  Cusa  and  of Pacioli and
       Leonardo, places modern  optical  biophysics  and its  military  and
       other applications into     the     proper     historical-scientific
       perspective.

            In was in the context of the  Council  of  Florence  that  Cusa
       published his famous <De Docta Ignorantia>, within  which is located
       the most fundamental  principle  of modern physical science, what is
       called today the principle of physical least action.

            In <De Docta Ignorantia> physical least action is introduced to
       us as a "Maximum Minimum Principle,"  as  the  notion modern physics
       associates with the "isoperimetric theorem" of topology as well as
       Leibniz's principle of physical least action. It was  on  this basis
       that Cusa became  the first modern figure of science to show why the
       solar hypothesis was necessary, and  out of which the foundations of
       modern relativistic physics were elaborated.

            The following points situate our subject-matter historically.

            Working from Cusa's principle of physical least action, Pacioli
       reconstructed the proof that the five platonic solids  are the limit
       of construction of regular polyhedra in euclidean space.

            This proof,  as  later  enriched  by Leonhard Euler and others,
       shows that the construction of the  Golden  Section  is  a  limiting
       value for construction of intelligible representation of forms in
       euclidean space.

            Pacioli and his collaborators added a discovery  which  remains
       confirmed in full  today,  that between the limits of the very large
       and the very small, the difference  between  living  and  non-living
       forms is that all healthy living processes are harmonically  ordered
       morphologically in a manner congruent with the Golden Section.


                                      Page 2





            Johannes Kepler applied that principle to the very large, to
       demonstrate that the  fundamental laws of astrophysics are congruent
       with the Golden Section.

            In other words, the fundamental  laws  of  physics  are  to  be
       adduced as reflections  of  the  curvature  of  physical  space-time
       reflected in the limiting value of the Golden Section.

            Carl Gauss  and his successors reworked Kepler's physics from a
       more advanced standpoint, and that  new  physics  of Gauss, Riemann,
       and others found a home among such leading scientists of nineteenth-
       century Italy as the great Betti and Beltrami, from  which the great
       Italian school of  electrohydrodynamics  and  aeronautics emerged to
       revive the heritage of Leonardo da Vinci in this field.

            Today, with aid of application of modern high-energy physics to
       the phenomena of what are called "force  free" states of plasmas, we
       show that the Kepler-Gauss-Riemann curvature for astrophysics is the
       curvature of physical space-time on the sub-atomic scale.

            Work is  currently in progress, with some preliminary  success,
       to show that  the ordering of the periodic table and the crystalline
       and other physical characteristics  associated  with each element of
       that table, is  determined  by synthetic methods coherent  with  the
       Kepler-Gauss-Riemann notion of the curvature of physical space-time.

            If astrophysics,  microphysics, and biophysics are each and all
       determined by such a common curvature  of  physical space-time, then
       we know several things of great practical importance  from this fact
       alone.

            First, we  know  that  all  of these processes are elementarily
       non-linear, in the sense that the progress of physics through Gauss,
       Riemann, and Beltrami implies. We  also know which popular axiomatic
       sorts of ontological assumptions in physics and biology  today  must
       be discarded, if  we  are  to  render  intelligible  the  elementary
       actions and principles  which  govern   the   the   sub-atomic   and
       astrophysical roots of these non-linear processes'  behavior  on the
       macro-scale of applications.

            My own  approach  to  these  matters  has  proceeded  from  the
       standpoint of my successful discoveries in my own profession, in the
       field which Liebniz defined and established as <physical economy>.

            A brief  description  of my contributions  to  the  science  of
       economy will render more accessible the connection  between  science
       and economy, which I report to you today.

            My entry  into  economic  science  started  approximately forty
       years ago, as a product of my angered  reaction  to  the  notion  of
       "information theory" then  being  popularized  by Professor  Norbert
       Wiener and others.

            Wiener, as  many  of  you  know,  attempted  to  explain <human
       intelligence> from the standpoint  of  the statistical gas theory of
       the Professor Ludwig  Boltzmann  who  died  in  1901,  allegedly  of
       suicide, at Duino castle.

            Since I had been a student of Leibniz since early adolsecence,

                                      Page 3





       and an opponent  of  Immanuel  Kant  from  Leibniz's  standpoint,  I
       recognized immediately the nature  of  Professor  Wiener's  folly. I
       chose the subject  of  the  impact  of  scientific   discovery  upon
       productivity of labor  as  the  empirical  standpoint  in  which  to
       situate my refutation of Wiener.

            Hence, I was able to show how, contrary to Kant, human creative
       mentation could be given an intelligible representation, and to show
       in what terms  productivity  might   be   measured,  such  that  the
       correlation between rates  of technological progress  and  rates  of
       increase of potential productivity could be measured and predicted.

            In order  to  supply  a  mathematical  representation  of  this
       function I had defined, I turned  to  the  work of Bernhard Riemann.
       Hence, the method I have contributed to the work of economic science
       is known as the LaRouche-Riemann method.

            It is  more  or less known that the scientific  work  of  Cusa,
       Pacioli, Leonardo, Kepler, Leibniz, Monge, Gauss, and Riemann, among
       others, is situated  within  the methods of what is called synthetic
       geometry, as opposed  to  the axiomatic-deductive  methods  commonly
       popular among professionals today.

            The method  of Gauss and Riemann, in which elementary  physical
       least action is represented by the conic form of self-similar-spiral
       action, is merely a further perfection of the synthetic method based
       upon circular least  action, employed by Cusa, Leonardo, Kepler, and
       so forth.

            It is from the standpoint of  Gauss-Riemann,  that we know that
       the elementary existence of physical least action, ontologically, in
       the complex domain,  is  reflected  necessarily  as   the   metrical
       characteristic of Golden  Section harmonics upon the apparent domain
       of the discrete manifold.

            This indicates that Gauss did  not overturn the earlier work of
       Cusa, et al.,  but merely completed it, giving it  a  more  adequate
       representation. From that   vantage-point,   we  are  able  to  move
       backward and forward in the history of physical science and biology,
       to correlate the work of earlier scientists  with the elaboration of
       the complex domain by Gauss, Riemann, et al., during  the nineteenth
       century.

            It is  feasible,  from this standpoint, to restate propositions
       in the language of axiomatic-deductive  methods into the language of
       the Gauss-Riemann domain.

            In this  way,  it  is  feasible to show rather  directly,  that
       creative mentation, as  typified  by  valid  fundamental  scientific
       discoveries, is not only non-linear, but belongs to a domain whose
       curvature is the same as that for a Kepler-Gauss-Riemann physical
       and biological domain.

            Empirical studies  also  show,  that  continuous  technological
       progress causes the    introduction   of   discontinuities    ("non-
       linearities") to any  attempt  at  a  linear  representation  of  an
       economic process.

            There is an analogous, but harmonically different sort of

                                      Page 4





       ordered succession of  discontinuities  in  a devolutionary process;
       the upward course  simulates  the  harmonic  ordering  of  a  living
       process, the downward course, an inorganic one, both  in  the  sense
       famously stipulated by Kepler in his paper on the snowflake.

            So, I  changed  the  definition  of  the  terms  "entropy"  and
       "negative entropy," from  the  statistical  definition  employed  by
       Wiener. "Negative entropy" or "negentropy" I supplied a synthetic,
       rather than a deductive definition, as akin to Pacioli's  definition
       of the characteristic ordering of living processes.

            I divided the two kinds of process-directions, negentropy and
       entropy, as Kepler did in his snowflake paper.

            As any physical economist must, who follows in the footsteps
       of Leibniz, I focussed my work chiefly on the subject of technology.

            The principal question posed to the specialist in technology of
       physical economy, is   to   establish   metrical   parameters  which
       correlate advances in scientific  principle  with  advances  in  the
       applied technology derived from such scientific principle.

            If we  define the elementary notions of "energy"  in  the  non-
       linear way Riemannian  physics  demands,  rather  than  the  popular
       scalar notions, all statements in physics can be cast in the form of
       statements of energetics defined in that non-linear way.

            In this mode, statements of physical principle become usable as
       statements defining technological  progress  in the functional terms
       required by economic science.

            Hence, my interests in biology and physics generally  have been
       restricted to those  matters  in  which  these  characteristics  are
       foremost. I have been concerned with  those  developments in biology
       which correlate with my knowledge of the characteristics of creative
       mentation, and with those matters of physics which  are  crucial for
       significant technological advances in the productivity of labor.

            For this  reason,  my  work in fields of technology significant
       for military applications has emphasized  the  method  of  achieving
       efficient spill-over of  these  technologies  into   the  domain  of
       civilian economy.

            My encounter  with  the modern optical biophysics of non-linear
       spectroscopy of living processes  was  a  direct  by-product  of  my
       preoccupation with the intelligible representation  of  the  form of
       creative mental processes.

            It was  clear  that human memory, for example, is a holographic
       sort of non-linear function, rather  than digital linear one. It was
       important to me, as an economist, to determine how  the requirements
       of nutrition and  other  physiological constraints must be seen as a
       matter of social and economic policy,  for  the purpose of fostering
       potential creativity among professionals and operatives.

            It is important, therefore, to correlate the characteristics of
       creative mental activity  with the biological processes  upon  which
       mental activity is grounded.


                                      Page 5





            For that reason, it is those aspects of biological processes
       which have the  same  general  characteristics  as  creative  mental
       activity which were  of  greatest   interest.   Work  in  non-linear
       spectroscopy provided a view of the elementary characteristics of
       cellular and sub-cellular life which was uniquely in  correspondence
       with the characteristics of creative mental activity.

            How could   it   be  different  than  that?  The  curvature  of
       astrophysical, microphysical, and  biophysical  space-time  are  the
       same as the curvature of creative mental processes. This arrangement
       is most convenient for us all, since if the curvature  of our mental
       creative processes were different than that of the universe in which
       we live, our universe could not be intelligible for mankind.

            It should be noted that Leonardo da Vinci understood matters in
       these same terms,  as we may recall from his emphatic defense of the
       principle of hypothesis.

            If we understand the way in which  the  self-bounding curvature
       of our universe underlies all correct notions of elementary physical
       laws, our power to discover with increasing perfection  of knowledge
       is limited only  by  the  adequacy  of our understanding of both the
       correct curvature and its implications.

            On this point, as many others,  modern  evidence  shows us that
       Leonardo was correct, and his critics crippled by their own error.

            The modern  view  of  biophysics  today, is that  the  harmonic
       ordering of non-linear  electromagnetic  processes  is  the physical
       characteristic of living processes, and that biochemical reactions
       are subsumed by this electromagnetic ordering.

            Moreover, this  shows  us that  biological  processes  are  not
       properly defined in   any   away  within  the  set  of   ontological
       assumptions associated with either a Cartesian or any sort of a neo-
       Cartesian discrete manifold.

            Modern biology turns our eyes to those aspects of astrophysical
       phenomena, in which  the  process as a whole must be comprehended in
       terms of included effects occurring at speeds greater than the speed
       of light; there  is  there,  as in  the  remarkable  electromagnetic
       coordination of tissues, a coherence of the process which defies the
       notion of propagation of action between particles at distance.

            In biological  processes,  these integrative  features  of  the
       electromagnetic field are among the most interesting phenomena.

            This knowledge of modern biophysics leads us in two directions.
       We derive from    modern,   electromagnetic   studies   of   optical
       biophysics, knowledge of new practicable  principles,  by  means  of
       which life may either be more readily disrupted, or assisted.

            The degree of refinement of technique, by means of which living
       processes might be maliciously affected, enables  us  to  accomplish
       such effects by  a small fraction of the energy deposited to produce
       thermal effects.

            Conversely, the potential to  improve,  to  heal,  is similarly
       increased. The knowledge gained in the one application, is, for

                                      Page 6





       better or for worse, inseparable from the other.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

                               As Weapons Systems
                               ------------------

            For rather  obvious  reasons,  including  my  desire that these
       techniques remain out of the hands  of  terrorists,  I  shall not go
       publicly into the technical details of this matter,  except  to  say
       that today nations  have  access  to means by which either hordes of
       locusts or large concentrations of human populations could be killed
       or otherwise neutralized by use of a single weapon of this type.

            The prototypes of the beam-generators  exist. The power-sources
       adequate for this exist either off the shelf or as  prototypes. With
       improvements in higher  temperature  superconducting  materials, and
       use of such electrodes for gyratrons  for example, strategic weapons
       of this class are in reach.

            The computers need to guide the propagation of  the  pulses are
       rather readily available   with   reasonable   effort   to   develop
       dedicated-application modules of the  required type. The appropriate
       wave-guides are a matter of ingenuity applied to a known field.

            The conveyances  suited  for  the  deployment of  such  assault
       weaponry exist, and   more   suitable   conveyances  rather  readily
       designed and produced.

            In short, strategic anti-personnel assault weapons as effective
       in their way as thermonuclear weapons,  are  an  imminent potential.
       Moreover, such strategic weapons are more readily deployed, and with
       fewer constraints upon  their  use,  than the thermonuclear  weapons
       they could often replace.

            Apart from  the  direct  use  of such technologies for military
       purposes as obvious as that, the  same  technology  is the basis for
       special applications producing  global  effects  upon  much  of  the
       earth's biosphere, or some local part of it.

            All of the most interesting effects are characteristically non-
       linear, rather than  being  the  kinds  of  actions, such as thermal
       effects, we associate  with  the electrodynamics  of  the  cartesian
       discrete manifold.

            There is  no prospect of putting such potentials  back  into  a
       bottle, to lock them away from military uses.

            The Soviets have long been dedicated to such weaponry, and have
       the scientific capability of developing and producing them today.

            How rapidly  they  might  produce such systems in strategically
       significant numbers, is another  question.  However,  we  note  that
       there are currently occurring very significant changes in the Soviet
       military order of  battle, changes which correlate  with  the  early
       deployment of significant numbers of weapons of this general class.

            We should   also  note,  that  the  Soviet  military  has  been
       dedicated to developing a global strategic ballistic missile defense

                                      Page 7





       system--its own SDI--for  about  twenty-five  years,  and  has  been
       developing such a system for deployment over the period of
       approximately seventeen years to date.

            During the first half of the  1990s,  the  Soviets  will deploy
       their own version of the U.S. SDI. The technological  base  required
       for the Soviet  version  of the SDI it is preparing to deploy, is an
       adequate base for   developing    and   producing   the   kinds   of
       electromagnetic assault weapons we are considering today.

            These new  types  are  weapons  are here, to  all  intents  and
       purposes. There are  only two classes of nations which will not soon
       deploy them: those which are already  subjugated by Moscow, or about
       to become subjugated. We shall develop them as rapidly  as possible,
       because we have no rational choice but to do so.

                         The Economics of These Weapons
                         ------------------------------

            There are  some  who will argue, that the present international
       financial collapse is leading us into a new global depression, worse
       than that of the 1930s.

            The financial collapse is now unstoppable; tens of trillions of
       dollars of financial paper will be  wiped  out  before the Spring of
       1989, and there is no means on Earth to prevent this from occurring.
       However, this financial  crash  need  not  lead  into   an  economic
       depression, if the  government  of  the  United  States comes to its
       senses during the months immediately ahead.

            Some will argue, that because  of  the  budget-cuts  and  other
       depressive effects of  the  financial crash, the U.S.  SDI  will  be
       stopped, and no new technological breakthroughs launched.

            To that  I  respond,  as  I  have done in my remarks to a Paris
       conference, that often it is the  case  that  only a profound crisis
       permits the unleashing of sweeping improvements in policy, including
       the unleashing of new scientific and technological revolutions.

            As long as leading institutions are complacently  content  with
       current policies, they  are  unlikely  to change those habits. It is
       when a profound  crisis brings the  smug  and  complacent  to  their
       knees, crying, "Save  us!"  that overdue advances are  permitted  to
       occur.

            If we come to our senses, and rid ourselves of the habits which
       have created the  great  financial bubble now collapsing upon us, if
       we return, in despair of any other  course, to a policy of promoting
       technological progress  in  a capital-intensive and energy-intensive
       mode, the present crisis were more likely to accelerate the kinds of
       technological changes I indicate, than to delay them.

            Despite the   increasing  erosion  of  scientific  and  related
       machine-tool capabilities during  the  past  twenty  years of "post-
       industrial drift," we have accumulated a vast store  of  new, unused
       technologies ready for immediate application.


                                      Page 8





            During this  same  time, we have entered into new dimensions of
       scientific research, from which can  pour  the  greatest  advance in
       human productivity ever known over the decades immediately ahead.

            Vis-a-vis the  Soviet  empire,  we  of  the West  have  certain
       inherent strategic advantages,  among  which  is  the  fact that the
       potential for productivity  in the  OECD  nations  is  approximately
       twice that in  the Soviet empire. The OECD nations  have  twice  the
       population of the Russian empire.

            Our population  has  twice  the productive potential of that of
       the Russian empire, if we but employ it properly. In addition, there
       are 350 millions  in Ibero-America,  predominantly  members  of  our
       Western European culture, and with similar productive potentials. We
       have seas of  population  among  our  friends  in  Africa  and  non-
       communist Asia.

            Together we  represent  the  overwhelming majority of the land-
       area, maritime choke-points, and population of this planet.

            Our greatest advantage is that which Moscow hates most bitterly
       of all, as  it  has  since  muscovy  was  first  founded  against  a
       counterforce against Roman missionaries such as Cyril and Methodius.

            We have  the gift of <agape> (prounounced ah-gah-pay),  as  the
       New Testament apostles   named  it  in  their  Greek,  the  law  and
       commandment that we must love God and our neighbor as ourselves.

            This <agape> is the emotion  of  love  of God, love of mankind,
       love of truth, and love of classical beauty. It is  also the quality
       which permeates and motivates creative thinking.

            For reason  of  the  idea  of  the  nature  of  God,  the human
       individual, and all else, which  is  the  precious  heritage  of our
       civilization, we have   been  given  the  greatest   potential   for
       generation and assimilation  of  scientific  and related progress of
       any culture.

            This gift is not a property of  our  race, but something which,
       with <agape>, we are properly destined to preserve and to share with
       all humanity. This gift is also the means by which  we  may  acquire
       all the power we need to defend that <agape> for our nations and for
       humanity as a whole.

            Our people  have  the  cultural  potential  to  generate and to
       assimilate technological progress  at  the  greatest  rate  possible
       among all mankind.

            It is not only a means of power; it is our nature  to order our
       affairs in such  a  way  that  the creative powers of the individual
       human mind are the quality with which we embed all our practice.

            It is the duty and the privilege  of the leaders of our nations
       to foster the  education,  the  conditions  of  family   life,   and
       opportunities for labor, which are consistent with that principle.

            The fostering  of the increase of the average productive powers
       of labor, to   the  benefit  of   all   mankind,   is   the   proper
       characteristic of man's labor.

                                      Page 9





            We must   choose  this  course  not  merely  because  the  very
       existence of our  civilization  is  menaced  from  the  east  today.
       Rather, it is the enormity of the crisis which impels us to resume
       a policy from which we should never have departed.

            It is  the  looming tragedy, threatening the existence  of  our
       civilization which obliges  us  to affirm those policies of practice
       which are the most natural way of life for our culture.

            Without overlooking the ominous  threat  from  the East, let us
       define the task  before  us,  in Milan today, as the  rebuilding  of
       Italy, as part  of  the  rebuilding of Europe, and of continuing the
       proper mission of western european  culture  to  the  benefit of all
       mankind.

            Let us situate the employment of these new technologies  within
       the economic task  of  rebuilding  Italy  as Betti and Beltrami, and
       Leonardo da Vinci before them, would have preferred we do.

            Let us  assume  that we are committed  to  large-scale  capital
       improvements in the basic economic infrastructure of  Italy. In that
       case, we may  assume  that the preconditions for capital improvement
       and growth of  the  nation's  agriculture  and  industry  are  being
       satisfied.

            Under those  conditions, what Italy must do  is  similar  in  a
       general way to  what  I  must do, if I become the next President, in
       the United States, and what must be done throughout western Europe.

            However, let us situate what  must  be  done in Italy itself in
       relationship to the  SDI and the new technologies  under  discussion
       here today.

            The crux  of  industrial  development of Italy is the efficient
       coordination of precious handfuls  of  scientists  and  machine-tool
       enterprises with the  complex of larger enterprises  which  are  the
       centers of industrial  production.  Let  us  begin  with the special
       relationship between scientific    teams    and   the   machine-tool
       enterprises.

            In the physics department of a well-organized  university there
       is a special sort of machine-tool shop.

            A scientist  has  devised an experimental hypothesis, perhaps a
       test of some crucial scientific principle.

            The scientist   works  with   the   university's   machine-tool
       facility, to create his experimental apparatus. Once a new principle
       has been established in that way, the same scientist  is situated to
       take the fruits  of  his work to a machine-tool facility, which will
       translate the discovery  into a new  technology  made  available  to
       industry.

            If industry has available adequate flows of investment-capital,
       retained earnings, and  credit  at  reasonably low  prices,  and  if
       investment tax-credits are  designed  to encourage such investments,
       industries will tend to gobble up  new  technologies  produced, even
       almost as rapidly as they are available.


                                      Page 10





            The integration  of  those  combined  efforts,  of research, of
       development of improved technologies in the machine-tool sector, and
       improved productive capital for industry,  is  the  triadic  form of
       optimal organization of   technological  industrial   progress   and
       growth.

            The popular  opinion  of  opposition  to this course of actions
       comes largely from those who have been infected with the ideology of
       "consumerism."

            These misinformed persons imagine  falsely, that it is consumer
       purchases which generate growth of industry. On the  contrary,  what
       prompts the growth  of  markets for households' goods, is the growth
       of population and employment.

            The most  important  source   of  this  growth  in  employment,
       agriculture aside, is  the  combination of capital  improvements  in
       basic economic infrastructure   and   employment  in  production  of
       capital goods.

            It is the vertical development of industry which makes possible
       its horizontal development;  it   is   chiefly   the  percentile  of
       operatives employed in  infrastructure  and  production  of  capital
       goods which enlarge the market for sale of households' goods.

            By basic   economic  infrastructure,  I  mean  water-mangement,
       general transportation, production and distribution of energy, urban
       sanitation, and such crucial contributions  to  the  productivity of
       labor as education and medical services.

            The dynamic  of  growth  is  supplied by the  increase  of  the
       productivity of agricultural  and  industrial  operatives,  and  the
       transfer of unemployed and marginally  employed  into  employment as
       such skilled operatives. The average growth of productivity  is  the
       true margin of real profit of a national economy as a whole.

            Since increase  of  productivity requires improved standards of
       life for households,  sustained  growth  and  profitability  can  be
       secured in only one way: through sustained technological progress in
       capital-intensive and energy-intensive modes of production.

            So, whenever  we integrate science, machine-tool  sectors,  and
       general industrial investment  in  the way I have indicated, we have
       turned that triadic relationship into  s  science-driver for raising
       the incomes and productivity of the economy as a whole.

            Obviously, therefore, the greater the ration of  scientists  so
       employed, the greater  the  ration  of  operatives  employed  in the
       machine-tool sector, and  the  greater   the  ration  of  operatives
       employed in capital goods production generally, the  more prosperous
       the economy will become.

            Thus, the  vertical  expansion  of  the  division  of  labor in
       industry, energized by the triadic  relationship, yields the highest
       potential rates of per-capita improvement of a national economy.

            The shrewdest  policy  for  this  case,  is  a   commitment  to
       technological "leapfrogging." In general, it were wiser for a nation
       not to try to compete with foreign industries on existing levels of

                                      Page 11





       technology in use;  instead  make  a  leap  ahead  of  the  level of
       technology currently practised in  foreign  nations.  The  worse the
       competitive level of repair of one's economy, the more  urgent  such
       "leapfrogging" is.

            Italy has  a  dwindling kernel of the quality of scientists and
       related advanced machine-tool capabilities in the tradition of Betti
       and Italy's aeronautics industry earlier during this century.

            Let us  take  a  number  of  such   diversified   technological
       capabilities, and group     them     under    a     single     name:
       "electrohydrodynamics."

            That represents   the  kernel  of  Italy's  special  scientific
       potentials. This is a scientific potential  well suited to the kinds
       of technologies associated with SDI and the new dimensions  of  non-
       linear electromagnetic biophysics and related fields.

            Link that  to  the  machine-tool  sector,  concentrating scarce
       resources along that technological breakthrough front.

            Link that to the vertical development  of  the  industrial base
       generally.

            This has  become  an  obvious  road  toward  applying   limited
       resources to the effect of fostering the optimal national result.

            It must  be  stressed,  that  the military application of these
       technologies is only a small fraction  of  their  potential.  It  is
       spilling these technologies into the civilian sector  as  rapidly as
       possible, which is  the principal source of benefit to the nation as
       a whole.

            At the  same  time,  it is an  intangible,  but  most  powerful
       economic benefit to  the  people  of  a  nation, to associate  their
       nation with technological achievements of which to take pride before
       the world.

            If a people says <agape>, finding its manifest national purpose
       beautiful in that  way,  that people is happier, and more productive
       for that reason.

            It is time for the nations of  western european culture to rise
       out of the quicksands of cultural pessimism, in which  we  have been
       trapped these past  twenty years, to assist one another in achieving
       great works worthy of being admired  by all humanity, and to rejoice
       in such accomplishments by our neighbors.

            Today, we  are  faced  with  the  grim  business  of  continued
       strategic conflict. Let  us  do what we must on the account, but let
       us enjoy more the good we acomplish  as contributions to the welfare
       of mankind in the course of doing our duty to our civilization.
