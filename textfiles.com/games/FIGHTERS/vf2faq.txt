INTRODUCTION

Preface to Virtua Fighter 1 FAQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Different is good.

Lately, gamers have been hit pretty hard by a barrage of fighting games
ranging from those whose only draw is blood and guts to those who resemble
a sick horse that should be humanely shot or at least taken to a hospital
for a few years....

With the release of their first ever fighting game, SEGA has broken new
ground by designing the only current martial arts game whose appeal isn't
violence or the ever popular 'magic' moves, but more geared towards
realism, fluidity of motion, and genuine martial art techniques. 

The ability to so successfully meet these goals is due to SEGA's System 1
polygon graphics engine which is much like the system  used in their
popular Virtua Racer.  This system can handle over 180,000 flat shaded
polygons per second, and since the fighters are three-dimensional figures
made of polygons instead of just flat images, be prepared to be dazzled by
more than just the backgrounds.

As for the game itself, Virtua Fighter plays like other recent fighting
games in some respects.  There are 8 characters to choose from, and the
basic object of the game is to, through the use of punches, kicks, throws,
grabs, pounces, and a variety of other techniques, drain your opponent's
life meter. The problem is that at this point Virtua Fighter already shows
its differences from other fighting games because you can also win by
knocking your opponent out of the ring.  Another difference is that Virtua
Fighter has many more special moves than any previous fighting game; there
are over 100 secret techniques to discover.  Not to mention that it just
feels more like a real battle due to the fluid motion and realistic moves.

Needless to say, Virtua Fighter is destined to be remembered as both a
great one on one martial arts game and a spectacular fighting simulator. 
If you haven't seen one yet, then go check it out at your local arcade.

Otherwise, check out the moves and strategies in this FAQ and then use them
to help you master this exciting game before someone else gets ahead of
you.


Preface to Virtua Fighter 2 Manual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This manual borrows quite heavily from the original VF1 FAQ. Apart from the
new moves, many of the old moves are taken from the VF1 FAQ.

VF2 is indeed a worthy successor to the original VF and has brought
fighting games to new heights. Apart from a new graphics engine (System 2),
it boasts two new and rather unorthodox characters with equally unorthodox
fighting styles to match.

To minimize much confusion in this manual, almost all moves are considered
to be taps. Hold down joystick moves are highlighted as such moves will
only work properly when the stick is held down. Experimentation with moves
has also revealed that most moves require the simultaneous tapping of
joystick and buttons. A good example would be Jacky's Punt Kick which is
now "for, for+K" instead of "for, for, K". Due to complex button and
joystick combinations for certain moves, the holding of the defend button
feature for some moves we know of in VF1 has been removed, so I have
decided not to highlight this option. Enjoy the manual.

BASICS



The buttons

^^^^^^^^^^^

While standing

==============

     PUNCH   - Steps forward with a punch

               Repeat for multiple punches



     KICK    - A kick to the head

               Not too powerful or effective



     DEFEND  - Blocks your opponents' high level and jumping attacks

               You take no damage from such attacks

               Low attacks do damage

               You are still pushed backwards





While squatting

===============

     PUNCH   - Low punch; hits standing defenders

               Stays in one place; quite weak and ineffective

               Good for stopping incoming high attacks

               If your character does not have a back/down+P or down+P

               special move or combo, these are alternative ways

               to execute a low punch.



     KICK    - Low snap kick to the leg; very weak

               Hits standing

               Longer reach than a low punch, but slower

               Good for stopping incoming high attacks

               Good for setting up combos and power attacks

               Able to stop low attacks if executed in time

               Able to push opponents back

               If your character does not have a back/down+K or down+K

               special move or combo, these are alternative ways

               to execute a low kick.



     DEFEND  - Defends against all low attacks

               Ducks under many standing attacks

               Most jumping/hopping  and mid-level attacks hit

               Some moves may still push you back



NOTE: defense doesn't work for attacks from behind







Hopping attacks

BASIC OPERATIONS



Before we start, on fighting techniques, below is the basic operation in
VF.


Selecting your character
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just highlight your character and tap P, K or D. To select alternate colors
of the character, hold the joystick up and tap the buttons.


Replays
^^^^^^^
After a set, a replay will take place. If you find that the replay is
irritating, may bypass it by tapping the START button. Be careful to tap
your own player start button. If someone has put in some tokens and you tap
the other player button, you have accidently forced someone to play against
you or worse challenged yourself as the tokens inside are yours.

There is more you can do during the replays and this will be covered in the
EASTER EGGS section.


Controller technique
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The new boxes that are used for VF2 are now standard. The button positions
form some form of circular arc which aid your fighting technique if you
position for fingers properly.

Joystick
========
The joystick is best held rather loosely. The are 3 main ways to hold the
joystick in VF:

1. Thumb and fingertips: Very much the same as you would hold an
eyedropper. It gives somewhat firm control for the diagonal movements. Good
response for taps in any direction using thumb or fingertips. Recommended
technique.

2. Engulfing: The ball on the stick is completely grasped into a fist. This
is not recommended though some have found this technique comfortable for
rolling actions in Akira's Dashing Palm or Wolf's Twirl and Hurl.

3. In-between: The stick is in-between the index finger and the middle
finger with palm facing upwards. Great control over up, down, forward and
back motions but lends poor control over diagonals. I've seen this
technique in one person who has tiny hands. So it is recommended for people
with little hands I think.

4. Situational: The use of 2 or all of the above techniques as the
situation demands.

Buttons
=======
The recommended technique is to use 3 digits for each of the buttons.
Personally, I think switching from button to button using a finger is
rather ineffecient though it is possible in VF1. In VF2 the moves
especially the elbow-knee and elbow-heel kick combo of the Bryants require
you to be fast. The recommended finger positioning is:

Defend: Thumb
Punch : Index finger
Kick  : Middle finger

An alternate way for big hands is:

Defend: Index finger
Punch : Middle finger
Kick  : Ring finger


Rounds and sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The action is VF is divided into rounds. In each round, you would spar the
opposing character. Each round is further divided into sets. Depending how
your arcade manager setups the box, rounds can be divided into 2/3, 3/5,
4/7 or 5/9 sets. 2/3 means you have to win 2 sets out of a total of 3. 3/5
means you have to win 3 sets out of a total of 5 and so on. The number of
sets you have to win is highlighted just below you character™s lifebar. Two
empty boxes shows that the machine is set to 2/3 and so on.


Versus computer combat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you choose to fight with the computer, the opponents follow in the order
below:

Lau, Sarah, Shun, Pai, Lion, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Wolf, Akira, Dural

The last fight which is a bonus stage is a battle between your character
and Dural. This takes place underwater amongst the ruins of the sunken city
of Atlantis. Action is in slow motion due to fluid viscosity.

Ranking mode
============
If you choose to fight against computer controlled opponents, you may
invoke the "ranking mode". This allows the computer to grade your  fighting
skills. Upon completion of the game (beating Akira but not necessarily
Dural), the computer gives recommendations to improve your technique.
However, if you get beaten halfway through, a grade will only be given.

If someone challenges you to a duel, ranking mode is not cancelled if you
defeat the challenger. You cannot continue ranking mode if you are defeated
by the computer.

To invoke ranking mode, tap all three buttons and press start together.
Current observations seem to suggest that the computer awards more points
for:

*	Floating your opponents.
*	Behind throws.

You can beat all computer opponents easily by just throwing, but what  you
get would just be 9th grade.

Expert mode
===========
For those craving for a challenge. You can turn the VF2 computer AI up by
invoking the "expert mode". At the character selection screen. Tap the
joystick down twice, up twice, left twice and finally right twice. You will
hear a sound (YAHOO). This means that expert mode is on. Select your
character. Under expert mode, the computer AI is souped up. It defends
against attacks better and uses more variety of attacks. Throwing computer
controlled opponents becomes more difficult and the computer adds more
throws to its variations.

This mode is good for practice. The variety of moves used against you would
help you learn how to defend and counter them. Definitely a must for those
serious in perfecting their VFing skills. Expert mode can work in
conjunction with ranking mode.

The flashing "USE" that appears sometimes just below that computer
opponent's lifebar has great significance. It shows that the computer is
using a move you or other previous opponents have successfully used against
it. Theoretically, the computer gets better and better as more opponents
challenge it in expert mode.

If a challenger comes and you lose to him, expert mode is not turned off.
The challenger will "inherit" the expert mode.


Entering your initials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is some general confusion in entering your initials. Actually it is
rather simple. Just hold the D button and move the joystick left or right
to select the character. The trick is to look at the characters changing at
the bottom of the screen. Once highlighted, release D and run towards the
character. You are to knock the character down and not just hit it to get
it entered. Once a character is entered, you can erase it with a backspace
by highlighting the backspace and knock it down. Be careful and quick when
entering the characters. You have 30 seconds to do this only.

You can only enter your initials after you beat Akira and made it to the
top 20 fastest completion times. Beating Dural is optional.


Sudden death
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the last deciding round happens to be a draw, the game goes to sudden
death where the fight takes place on a ring which size is 1/16 of the
original. The object is to mainly RO the opponent as a decider for that
round. If the sudden death is a draw, the challenger is the loser. If you
are playing against the computer, the player loses if a draw happens; which
is most unlikely.


GENERAL FIGHTING TECHNIQUES

This part covers some basic fighting techniques in VF2. Please note that
VF2 is still a ground based game. SEGA has made air attacks in this game
fairly worthless. Though now with increased speed, aerial attacks are still
rather quite slow. Hopping attack speeds are however improved, so they are
now more useful. To make matters worse for jump kickers from VF1, computer
controlled opponents are able to return a jump kick to your character once
a jump kick is missed.

The guide below is just a basic guide. Most are borrowed from the VF1 FAQ.
It is by no means a formula to successful VFing. A flexible fighting
technique is needed for human versus human fights. This is also required
for versus computer fights since the computer now remembers the moves that
are successfully used against it and will defend itself against these same
attacks.

Now then, the techniques...


A flurry of jabs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By simply tapping the punch button repeatedly, your character, whomever he
(or she) may be, will step forward and punch as they go.  They will punch
2-3 times and then pause for a second before they can begin to attack
again.

Works good when:

*   when your enemy has very little life left.
*   when your enemy is close to the edge of the ring (to get a RO).
*   sometimes to start the round out with.
*   if they are in the air, you can usually hit them with an attack, and
    follow that up with two or three punches before they hit the ground
    Jeffry, Lau, and Wolf can tag on their uppercut/knife hand to make a
    more deadly combo whenever they catch someone in the air with a punch
    or a kick if you tag on the kick part of their combos.

Works bad when:

*   if you use it too much and the opponent counters with a low attack.
*   if your opponent has a special counter-attack move.


Hopping attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the increased speed in VF2, hopping attacks can be used to counter low
attacks. Very useful against opponents who are getting up to sweep you. Hop
kicks are useful against low defenders though they are quite weak in terms
of damage inflicted. Hopping hammers and jabs inflict heavy damage.
However, they cannot attack low or standing defenders. They are more useful
at close range when a low attack is expected.

Some characters' hopping kicks are just pure deception. Kage, Lau, Shun and
Lion have toe slides or sweeps in place of a hop kick. This can be achieved
by tapping K while descending from the hop.


Jumping attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jumping and kicking immediately works well if they are really close to you.
You can catch them off guard if they are closing in with a fury of jabs.

This attack also hits a low defenders. Therefore it is very valuable to
people who don't have many other attacks which can hit a squatting
opponent.

If they aren't close, then you have three options:


Distance drop kicks
===================
Has deceptive range.  Probably the best distance attack.  You must hit the
kick button before you reach the peak of your jump.  You can only be hit
out of it if your opponent does a close jumping kick before your kick comes
out and that is a very hard move to time (of which the computer opponents
do so well). This works well as an ambush attack as well. As an opponent
closes in with punches, jump overhead him and drop kick him from behind
since defend does not work for attacks behind.

Landing kicks
=============
If you hit the kick when descending from a jump, you will kick before you
land. This does have benefits as you can surprise someone who thinks you
are easy meat after a failed jumping attack.

Overhead hammer
===============
You need to hit the punch button before you reach the peak of your jump.
Better than the mid-air kick, but not as good as the drop kick.

VF2 allows you to have two jumping attacks per jump. It may surprise many
who do not know this. However, do not be complacent. Jumping kicks are
still desperation moves and recovery from a jumping attack is slow leaving
you vulnerable to any attack or worse, a throw.


Ring out
^^^^^^^^
Knocking your opponent out of the ring is a perfectly legitimate way to win
a set. The simplest way to accomplish this is, when they are close to the
edge, to use a fury of jabs or a sweep since these attacks will push them
backwards even if they defend. Squatting kicks are rather good too as your
character will skip forwards for the kick.

Note that Kage's flying kick pushes people back very far, and that Wolf's
spinning throw can throw the person out of the ring if you are lucky for
that, try to have your back to the edge since that is the direction that he
finally lets them fly. Akira's close-in ram can knock lighter opponents
like Lion, Sarah and Pai out of the ring from just off the center of the
ring. Jeffry's flying butt attack is good to push people out too.


Waiting for your break
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One of the more successful defenses can be to simply just crouch and sit
below your opponents attacks until they pause in their attack.  You can
then counter with one of the following.

*	a power move ¥ like Kage's heel kick, Wolf's Shoulder Ram or Akira's
	jumping kicks.
*	a throw ¥ just perform the motion for the throw you would like to do.
	Characters are easy targets for throws while they recover from moves such
	as high kicks, missed pounces and jumps. 
*	a combo or combination attack ¥ like Jacky's elbow-heel kick combo or
	Sarah's elbow-knee combo.


Dodging and counter-attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the increased speed in VF2, you can execute dodges and counter-attacks
at a moments notice. Most characters have a dodging punch move or some sort
of counter-attack equivalent to Pai's defensive grab.

There are many ways you can counter-attack. Everytime you see an attack
coming, just back off and retaliate while the opposing character recovers.
Just be imaginative. For example, backward kickflips duck under many
punches. Use this to your advantage.

In addition, those special dodge and punch moves can break your opponent™s
defences at close range. The success of these moves depend on the feet
position between both you and your opponent. If you desire to do this, try
to have opposing feet position. It should look like this:

       Character A        Character B
                 -        * 
        -                           *


In the case of those defensive grabs. It is best to set up your opponent to
make that crucial move you want them to make. On purpose in previous sets,
make yourself vulnerable to a particular move like a side kick or punch for
a certain situation. Then present this same situation to them and grab
their attack. It is all up to your head to set up the "sting". An example
would be to present yourself as vulnerable after Akira's dashing elbow to
punch-kick combos. Then after a set, do a dashing elbow, tap D then back+P
when you know the opponent's punch is incoming. This is what they mean by
using these counter-attacks with finesse. This applies to all characters
with a special counter-attack.


Attacking while rising
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When an opponent knocks you down, you can get up with an attack. There are
many ways to do it thus giving you many variations. Rising attacks
depending on how they are executed will hit either low or standing
defenders. However, a missed rising attack with an opponent nearby spells a
free attack on your character. It is wiser to use the rolling away attacks
as they get you away from the action and discourages throws from players
that follow you through the roll hoping for a free throw.

Rising attacks inflict 20 points of damage with the following exceptions:

Lion - rising rear kick inflicts 20+20 points of damage since he does 2
kicks instead of one. It comes out when he has fallen with his face down.

Lion, Kage, Wolf, Jeffry - Counter-roll heel smash inflicts 30 points of
damage.

Jeffry - Rising head butt when head is towards the opponent gives 30 points
of damage. This will happen when Jeffry has fallen with his face down.

All characters are vulnerable to rising attacks after a missed pounce. If
your opponent plays a character that misses most of his pounces like Wolf
and Jeffry, do a rising attack.

Do not do too many rising attacks as most experienced players would rather
back off after a successful attack. Players with characters that have some
form of long distance attack like Kage (Flying kick) or Sarah (Toe
kick-side kick) would take the opportunity to attack from a distance with
these moves. Be careful when you get up or you may find yourself trying to
get up again.

Countering rising attacks now are more difficult. However, if your opponent
gets a bit too predictable, you can:

*   do a hopping attack in response to any sweep. Hopping hammers and jabs
    are good as they do the most damage.
*   defend in response to a kick or sweep. Attack them with your best
    depending on how they respond. If they defend, throw them. If they think
    they can sneak some additional attacks after a missed rising attack,
    muster your best attack against them.

Getting a bit too predictable can be a psychological weapon as well. Do
rising attacks different from previous attacks to make your opponent think
he's got you figured out.

Sometimes do an attack that allows you to fall flat on the ground. Shun's
attacks are a fine example. Falling flat on the ground after an attack
tempts your opponent to come closer especially for an opportunistic throw.
Kick or sweep them as they come near since recovery from such moves are
faster. This may be dangerous as characters now can kick or punch opponents
on the ground.


Hit “em when they™re down
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NEARLY every time you knock your opponent down you should try for a pounce.
Below are the description for both low and high pounces with damage points
listed.

            30                          40

Pounce ranges in VF2 are much shorter that in VF1. Sarah and Kage do not
have unlimited pounce ranges anymore. The motions for pounces (up+P) can be
done the moment your opponent starts falling. You can also time your
pounces to hit someone trying to get up. The damage is even more severe in
this case. Imagine Jeffry's entire butt landing on your head!

On top of pouncing, characters can use alternative attacks against fallen
opponents. Kicks, punches to the ground, elbow drops are some of the few.
They are fast and rather efficient. These attacks will not keep the
opponent on the ground for long. Each kick or punch will move them further
away from your character, therefore each subsequent attack can fail opening
you up for a rising attack. At most get two of these attacks in and back
off. The motion for these attacks like pounces can be done when the
opponent starts falling. However, these alternative moves require you to be
close to the fallen opponent to connect.


The universal punch-kick combo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is by far the most important combo to learn. It is fast and can be
called upon any time you need speed and power. Low pounces connect well
after a successful punch-kick combo. This combo is best used after your
opponent fails an attack that lands him close to you. Jacky has two
different punch kick moves. At close range, it is a punch and side kick. At
further ranges, it is a punch and crescent. Both have it™s uses but most
likely, the punch and side kick comes out. The punch and side kick of Jacky
makes opponents stagger rather than knock them down. Follow-up with any
fast powerful attack like a beat knuckle.

Learn this combo and remember to call it when you need it.

The side kick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Basically, this is the move to use against low opponents. It recovers
slowly so make sure you connect when you unleash it. The following are side
kicks of the characters with their damage points.

Character   Damage points
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Akira       23
Pai         21
Lau         23
Wolf        33
Jeffry      33
Kage        22
Sarah       19
Jacky       25
Shun        21
Lion        24


Kickflipping
^^^^^^^^^^^^
All the characters except for Akira, Jeffry, and Wolf can backflip. Those
who can backflip can do a type of attack called kickflipping, which is a
high backwards flip in which the legs can hit the opponent and do major
damage besides looking just totally cool. Lion does not backflip but
cartwheels. Shun is able to backflip but does not have a kickflip.

There are two kinds of kickflips. Backward kickflips and kickflips. In
backward kickflips, the exponent backflips doing a handstand and kicks as
he/she is flipping backwards. Kickflips are performed as the exponent kicks
into the air and flips without ground contact until landing. Backward
kickflips and kickflips hits opponents jumping in though kickflips gain
more altitude thus giving a higher chance of a successful hit.

Only Pai, Lau, Kage, Sarah and Jacky have kickflips. Kage has two different
kickflips at his disposal. 

All kickflips and their combos hit low defenders which is a feature not
seen in VF1.


Turning around moves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These moves are new and cool in VF2. Most fast characters have attacks that
turn them around to face their back at the opponent. These attacks can be
used in conjunction with turn around and face opponent attacks. This opens
up new opportunities for positional play. To play this way, one must have a
clear mind on the direction.

If you choose to turn around with a punch, this turn around punch can be
executed as part of a punch combo. So these moves can be used to set up
ambushes and combos.

The bad thing about this is that if you are caught with your back on an
opponent, the end may be drawing near.

Control motions for turn around moves are "back, back+BUTTONS". To execute
it properly, you MAY have to hold the second "back" motion. This is
advantageous as you can tap the buttons twice to execute the same move
twice. First to turn away from the opponent and the second to turn and face
the opponent. This can be good for characters like Kage who has many turn
around moves, he can have a combination of turn around moves.


Harrassment
^^^^^^^^^^^
Squatting and kick together will produce a harrassment kicks to the leg.
These kicks are fast but are very weak. Their use as combo stoppers are
good as they have a good reach. They can be used to attack an already
weakened opponent for a KO. When used in conjunction with low punches, they
can be a major source of irritation for combo maniacs. Low punches are good
to set up for throws as well. All in all, low attacks are a major
irritation to many. Lion's low swipe kicks are so good they are a special
move all by itself.

Low punches and kicks can also be used to force an opponent to block low
for major attacks against low defenders. Sarah's squatting kick is fast and
if the defender blocks low for these kicks, her arsenal of attacks against
low defenders can be unleashed. Jeffry and Wolf are the tallest characters
in the game. Their low kicks have the longest reach.

Low punches and kicks are however not good if someone has you figured out.
All characters have moves that attack characters staying low and all of
them wreak tremendous havoc. Even Pai has a scissors kick that can spell
trouble to anyone punching or kicking low. Jeffry and Wolf have throws that
are very painful against low attackers who fail in their attacks. So, as
much as possible, do not overuse these moves.


Ambushes
^^^^^^^^
Due to the fast pace of action in VF2, you may find yourself behind facing
an opponents back. You can start combos or do behind throws from that
position. To set yourself up behind an opponent can be pure chance or pure
cunning as with Akira. His Surprise exchange pull and Backwards uppercut
can be used to do an all important knock out move or ring out.

Also, distance drop kicks to the back can be achieved on rising opponents.
This is a good ambush maneuver though very underhanded does the job pretty
well. Just jump forward till you are overhead the rising opponent and drop
kick his back. The timing and distance in this move is crucial.

If you do find yourself about to be ambushed from behind, you can:

*	turn with an attack. This is particularly useful if someone wants to
    throw you. Turning around with a low attack (down+K) is particularly
    useful.
*	run. It is okay to run like a chicken at such a situation. Attacks and
	throws from behind are devastating. It is the only way to escape from a
	drop kick from behind.


Pulling back a kick or a punch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To pull back a kick, press the kick button, and then press the D button
before your kick has been raised above your knee. This works for standing
punches, squatting punches and kicks too but you have to be faster. What
you do after that is up to you, but your opponent will probably block. You
can either throw them or attack them with a move that their defending
position is vulnerable to.


Delayed action moves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combos and special moves that have many motions can be done with delayed
action. A fine example is the P, P, P, K combos. Tap the three Ps quickly,
then pause for a few milliseconds before tapping K. What you get is three
punches, a short pause and the kick move. Lau players have been known to
use this very often to fool opponents. Sarah and Jacky's elbow combos can
do this too if you hold the joystick forward after the elbow before tapping
K milliseconds later. There are many moves that can do this. Discover these
yourself.


Throwing and close range moves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Throwing and other close range moves can only be done at punch range.
Besides being close to the opponent, you have to have the correct foot
positioning. Which is feet positioning that does not mirror the opponents.
Your character's left foot if it is in front should correspond to the
opposing character's right foot which is a step behind his left. So from
top view it should look like:

       Character A        Character B
                 -                  *
        -                 *

This would present a throw opportunity if range permits. A throw can be
done even when the feet positions mirror one another but it is just more
difficult to get out. Depending on the type of throw, the control motions,
especially "for, for" motions; throws can be done with incorrect feet
positioning. This motion allows your character to •crash¢ onto the opposing
character thereby creating correct feet positioning. You can also effect
frontal throws from your opponent™s sides if you find youself in such a
position and if your character™s throw allows it.

If you are facing the side of your opponent more towards the back, a behind
throw can be executed.

Punch-throw techniques
======================
If an opponent tends to try to close distance with you by moving forward,
try punch and throwing him.  Do a single punch, crouching or standing,
followed QUICKLY by the motion for the throw you want to do. If the punch
connects, there is a good chance they will still be in range for a throw.
"Heavy" fighters, such as Jeffry and Wolf, are particularly vulnerable,
since the punch will hardly move them at all.

The punch is fast enough to interrupt any attack the opponent may be
attempting, and the throw if done correctly will come out while they are
still reeling from the punch.  Even if the opponent blocks, the throw will
connect so long as you are close enough.

Typical Punch and Throw techniques are Kage's Punch and Toss (P, back+P),
Wolf's Punch and Twirl (P, back, SCR, for+P) and Lau's Punch and Head Slam
(P, back, for+P).

Escaping throws
===============
You can escape all P+D throws and Jeffry's body press only. To escape from
a P+D throw, tap P+D the moment the opponent begins to throw you. To be
extra sure, you can tap P+D continuously as the throw begins as if you are
getting up after being knocked down. To escape Jeffry's  body press, do
back+P+D.

What you do after successfully escaping from the throw is up to you. Wolf's
Backfall suplex is particularly vulnerable to attacks as the escapee falls
upright just behind him.

You cannot escape from complex control motion throws and behind throws.
When throwing experienced opponents, it is best to use complex control
motion throws. However, P+D throws are given preference if both players
executes the throws at the same time. So it may be safe to use P+D throws
in some situations. Its all up to you.


Hit “em in the air
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes characters play a little handball with their opponents by
repeatedly punching, uppercutting and otherwise bouncing them along in the
air. Lau is the true master of this technique, able to bounce opponents up
to eight times in a single combination of moves. With the increased speed
in VF2, almost all characters are able to do this better than in VF1.

There are many combination attacks that keep opponents in the air. Possible
combinations are:

*   Knee and uppercuts for Jeffry
*   Knee and running punches for Wolf
*   Toss and flying kick for Kage
*   Aerial jumping turn kick, rising knee combo and kickflip for Sarah
*   Any attack from Shun followed by 3 breakdance sweeps
*   Any of Lion's moves followed by his low swipe kicks

The list goes on. Discover these yourself.

A rule of thumb is to lower the height level of your attacks. Start out
attacking high. If the opponent is hit, keep him in the air. As he/she
starts falling, progress to mid-level attacks, then finally to low-level
attacks.


Developing your own combinations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You have to develop your own combinations. One lovely system to develop
combinations is what I call the "common joystick motion" system. For
example, let us take a look at Akira.

Akira has a close range defense breaking move called the shake 'em up. Its
control motion is back+P+D. He also has a dashing elbow and its motions are
back, for, for+P. You can combine these two moves into a beautiful move and
so what you do is:

back+P+D, for, for+P

This would effectively give you a shake 'em up to soften their defenses and
a dashing body check to the opponent.

Here is another example you might consider. Again we will use Akira. There
are 2 Akira moves that require him to stay low first and these are his
dashing palm moves. So his combination can be developed as:

down+P or down+K, for+P for a low punch or kick followed by a palm.

This works very well as Akira does not have any special move that have the
motion of down+P or down+K. Effectively, you get a low kick or punch with
this motion by tapping down and the respective buttons. This makes Akira
squat first for the low punch or kick, then tap forward and punch for the
single palm. There is no need to roll the stick forward. If you need a
double palm, do a low punch or kick followed by back then forward and
punch.

Just study your characters' moves and check out which moves have common
motions. Develop your own combinations and have fun!


Listen and look
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Above all be alert. Listen for loud bangs from the speaker that signify a
damaging hit that would knock the opponent out cold for some time. This
would help you know when to pounce. Also, listen for powerful moves that
make whistling noises. If they hit, the opponent is also knocked down cold
for some time. Small "bish" noises usually signify a minor hit. Pouncing
after this may land you into trouble.

Keep your eyes on the opposing character and judge the distances. Above all
practice till the moves come out instinctively even without you looking at
your character.

EASTER EGGS


Slow motion replay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a particular finishing is funny, gross, painful, humiliating or
spectacular; you may opt for a slow motion replay. As you KO, RO or TO your
opponent, hold down all three buttons to effect the slow motion replay
option. You are only allowed one slow motion replay per entire game.


Victory taunts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Another nice touch to replays is the victory taunts and phrases. You can
actually control what your character says. During the replay, hold down
either P, K, or D to select the taunts. Win a set under ten seconds and
your character will say the "below ten second taunt".


Game completion replays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you complete the game, the replays of all the stages will be played. The
trailing animation frame shadows for these replays can be controlled. Tap
the left player D button to negate the frames and the right player D button
to reveal the frames. Tapping the joystick up decrease the number and speed of
trailing animation frames. Tapping down will increase the number and speed of
trailing animation frames.


Kage™s face mask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Kage's face mask will only fall off if he wins 20 straight wins from
challengers. After that, Kage will have his face mask falling off
indefinitely after being knocked down; provided the VF2 machine is not
turned off at the end of the day. He has no scar on his cheek anymore and
he is described as rather handsome.

A little bird told me
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At Jacky's stage where the background are mountains. You can actually see a
virtua bird! Just hold down all buttons including the start buttons. You
will see the bird swooping down from far away. This bird will hover around
the losing character. As long as a human versus human fight features the
Jacky mountain background, this bird can be called out. Please note that
when playing with Sarah against the computer, the background will not be
mountains when you reach Jacky. The background will be a city street, thus
you cannot see the bird.

If you like the old BGM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the momentary silence before the first set of every round begins, hold
down PLAYER 1 START button to play a funkier VF1 version of the music
played in Jacky™s stage. Hold down the PLAYER 2 START button for a funkier
version of the music played in Sarah™s stage. This funkier music would end
when you start a new round.


Give the next player problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you reach Dural, Fight win all sets except the last one so that you
are ahead. For the last set, back off a little then stay low and squat
doing nothing. Dural will keep doing 2 low punches and a low kick but will
not advance to attack or even throw you. The resulting set will be a DRAW
but you still win the round. During the replays, your character will be
shown in a ready state facing Lau but nothing happens during the credit
scroll.

When the next in line starts a new game, the scenary is different from the
normal and the characters show trailing animation frames or even disappear.
It is very difficult to fight the game in this mode. The only way to get
rid of this is to reset the machine. Try not to do this unless you are in
the mood to pick up a real fist fight.

The true power of Akira
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you get to key in your own initials for getting to the top twenty with
Akira, do not key in the "END". Make Akira run quite far away until he
appears quite small. Don't run too far though. Do a special move of Akira
and you will see the whole screen shake. 


Credit roll
^^^^^^^^^^^
In the demo mode, hold down the player start button to invoke the credit
rolls. Release the start button and the credit roll will freeze.


Mysteries and rumors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would notice, the name of the character just below the lifebar will
flash when certain moves from your character connects. I have no idea what
it means.

The skybreaker is still a rumor.

Akira does have a sliding attack. Well, not really sliding. He actually
gets down on one knee and gives a low side kick. Any information on how it
is done is appreciated.

Any info on selecting Dural would be appreciated.

CHARACTER GUIDE


The Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The number one fighter at the First World Fighting Tournament is Lau Chan.
Lau used the legendary Koen-ken. Watching Lau's distinctive style of
fighting, Akira realizes that he lacks experience. After the Tournament,
Akira returns to a worldwide fighting tour. One year later, an invitation
for the Second World Fighting Tournament reaches Akira. The invitation
contained a list of participants including Lau Chan as well as new
participants unknown to him. Akira felt an evil overtone to the letter,
nevertheless his enthusiasm as a fighter made him determined to participate
in the Tournament.

Editor's Notes
==============
Lau Chan is the champion because of a nationwide VF1 competition held at
Game Spot 21 in Tokyo, Japan. This explains the sequence in which the
player challenges computer controlled characters. Shun and Lion are
inserted in the sequence where a character appeared more than once in the
top ten winning characters.

Nationality    : Japan
Fighting style : Hakkyoku-ken/Eight Poles Fist


VF1 Storyline
=============
Hakkyoku-ken, one of the foremost Chinese martial arts.

During the Second World War, the Japanese arm developed their own 
Hakkyoku-ken techniques to improve their infantry's fighting ability.

Akira Yuki is the son of the man who developed these techniques. He serves
as the assistant instructor at Yuki Budokan. Hot-blooded and impulsive by
nature, he also can be naive and intemperate.

After completing his training under his father's tutelage at the age of 23,
he went on a quest to test his abilities.

When he got word of this World Fighting Tournament, he decided to enter.

VF2 Storyline
=============
The only person to whom the ultimate martial art of Hakkyoku-ken is handed
down. Realizing that the last time he lacked experience; Akira is now
testing the results of last year's training and practice. During the last
Tournament, Akira was a bit to "enthusiastic" and his attitude was met with
much disapproval. He was humiliated by Kage and bears a grudge against him.

Editor's notes
==============
Akira is the "star" character of VF1. He didn't do very well and so Jacky
became more or less the star. Also the VF1 competition in Japan had a Lau
player as the winner.

Many players attributed this to difficulty in using Akira as a playing
character in VF. They decided to make Akira stronger for VF2 as a result.
He is truly Mr Dynamite now.

VF developers seem to have Eight Directions Palm Boxing or Pa Kua when they
worked on Akira. The style is based on the premise that if you can defend
yourself at the eight compass points covered by the trigrams (an octogon),
you will be fully protected from attack. This is the reason for the
compulsory D button for Akira's counters-attacks, to align himself to the
incoming attack.

The main characteristics of this style are open palm strikes and footwork
based on the trigrams. Being one of the "internal" styles (most famous of
which is Tai Chi), emphasis is placed upon developing "chi" energy. This
explains the power of Akira's attacks. Also, each move is done by stamping
one's feet which explains the explosive sounds of Akira's dashing elbow
strike and power uppercut. The cracks on his stage explains this too.

Advanced students of this form of martial arts mount their attacks in
twisting, spiralling movements. The twist is done from the waist and
generates tremendous power. This is seen in Akira's dashing body check,
backwards uppercut and counter-attacks.

The style is brought to light by Tung Hai Chuan 400 years ago in China.
However, many believed the fighting style has existed for more than 1,500
years.

Research and posts from the rec.games.video.arcade suggests that Akira's
style of fighting is a mix of Chinese kung fu. His pull-in, push-out throw
has Shoalin origins.

Fighting with Akira
===================
He has his main strength in his special moves and close range moves. 
Almost all of those multi-punch and kick combos have be removed since not
many people use them anyway. The speed of all his special attacks would
more than compensate for this. Use them all to your advantage.

Playing with Akira would mean pure aggressive play. The increased speed in
VF2 would mean his special moves would come out faster. I have seen many
Akira players do five continuous dashing elbows in a row to RO an opponent.
Cheesy it may seem but it displays the level of aggressiveness he should be
played.

His close range moves are rather deceptive than powerful. Only his trip and
punches; the pull in, throw out; and close-in ram can knock an opponent
down.  The rest of the close range moves allow him for free strikes based
on confusion created by these moves. The insidious surprise exchange is a
good example.

His dashing palm is a move everyone fears. It will knock down a standing
non-defender or send a squatting non-defender across the ring dragging on
his butt. If the latter happens, rush forward and throw the person using
the close-in ram.

Though Akira is fast in his attacks, the recovery from these attacks are
slow. The notorious dashing body check is the slowest in its recovery and
exposes Akira's back to the opponent momentarily. However, he has his
counter-attacks to make up for this. These counter-attacks are precisely
used to defend Akira from attacks after his special moves. This makes him
even more dangerous in attack or defense.

To do his counter-attack, the D button is compulsory. You have to tap it
prior to the back+P, back/down+P or down+P motion. According to the way he
is attacked, the counter-attacks come out in 8 variations; more or less
influenced by the counter-attack control motions. It is most essential to
learn his counter-attacks to harness Akira's full potential. All his
counter-attacks are very damaging and can push opponents far away.

Most consider the stun palm, backwards uppercut and double palm combo as
the desired move to master. This combo's first two moves are quite clear
cut. However, the last palm move can be done while holding the down/for
from the backwards uppercut momentarily followed quickly by back+P or
for+P. The actual full motion is:

All, back, down/for+P+K, (back/down or down or down/for), (back or for)+P

VF1 Storyline
=============
She is a leading star in Hong Kong action films.

Her moods change as quickly as a cat's - she can erupt in passion in one
minute, and turn icy cold in the next.

Lau's only daughter, Pai was especially trained by her father in martial
arts from a young age. Lau was jealous of her superior abilities, however,
so she ran away from home at 16 when her mother died.

Two years later, she was a success in the movie industry. When she recieved
word that her father was going to enter the World Fighting Tournament, she
also decided to enter.

VF2 Storyline
=============
Pai took part in the First World Fighting Tournament to test her skills. It
revealed that she was rather weak and she decided to train for a year
before the Second World Fighting Tournament. During the past year, she
incorporated her own techniques and tactics she has discovered.

She determined to defeat (this time for sure) her father for pursuing his
own ideals at the expense of his family.

Editor™s Notes
==============
Pai, the "weak" little girl of VF1 is better than before. Now there are not
many Pai players but there is one I met that could trash any Sarah player.
She is mainly used by her fans and die-hards. With this new speed in VF2,
she can float opponents as well of her father now.

This fighting style is actually named Bok Hok Pai or White Crane. It is
invented by a Tibetan lama. It is said that the lama observed a fight
between a crane and a monkey. The crane would defend by evading and
retaliating with its wings. The "wings" motion can be seen in Pai downward
chop and defensive chop with changing of feet position. The lama who
observed this put together 8 techniques from the crane's natural movement
with the ape's footwork and grabbing maneuvers. This style is is not to be
confused with the Southern Shaolin 5 animal system which also involves a
crane.

Incidently, the Chinese emperor's imperial guards are taught this fighting
style in secret to protect him. This style also found its way to many other
kung fu. Watching Pai fight in VF2 is a joy. The moves are flawless and
show a sense of grace and beauty.

Fighting with Pai
=================
Pai's strength is still her parry. She is fast and avoiding attacks is easy
with Pai. She still has a weakness for low defenders but that is partially
solved with her downward slap and scissors kicks. Her combos come out fast
but would leave her totally vulnerable to throws if they fail to connect.
Believe me, nobody in the right mind would want to punch or kick Pai.

Her back+P counter-attack is now more versatile and can grab a variety of
attacks. Playing her is exactly the opposite of Akira. Pure defense. Her
throws are rather fast and for anyone running up to her hoping for a free
throw must be nuts. Her punches are fast enough to counter any would be
throwers. For anyone closing in with punches, she can just back off easily
due to the speed of her quick step back. Depending on the range they are
closing in, a quick step back followed by her grab and attack would deter
most.

If a slightly more aggressive Pai is more your liking, use downward slaps
combined with sweeps or side kicks. If the side kick floats the opponent,
follow-up with the running punches with sweep combo or the crescent combo
if they are kept in the air longer. Her single scissors kick spells trouble
if she is not stopped in mid-flight. She closes in quite fast with this
move and recovers fast for downward slaps, sweeps or side kicks with punch
combos. Since she this move enables her to change her feet position, she
can throw almost immediately. If they squat low after the scissors kick,
she can cartwheel over and deliver moves for more devastation.  

All in all, concentrate on defense. Only use her combos to retaliate
throwers. Throw all those dumbfounded defenders afraid of attacking her.
Above all, set up your "stings". Her falling DDT and stomach throw can RO
many. Use the pushover throw to avoid ROs.

VF1 Storyline
=============
A leading Chinese chef, he is also a master of the legendary Koen-ken
martial art. A quiet man, he nevertheless has the air of resourcefulness
and skill seen only in those skilled in the art of Koen-ken. His cold
appearance belies a gentle nature.

He achieved one of his life's ambitions when he was awarded the Grand Prix
at the world's most renowned competition for Chinese chefs. Now, he is
ready to fulfill his next ambition. He is resolved to enter the World
Fighting Tournament and achieve his ultimate goal.

VF2 Storyline
=============
He is came from Northern China, Shandong Province. He was the strongest
fighter and winner of the last Tournament. This made him happy as his
martial arts school was looking for successor and the requirement was for
him to win the Tournament.

After the First Tournament, he retreated to the mountains to train and
develop new techniques to improve his ultimate art. He is taking part in
the Second World Fighting Tournament using advanced Koen-ken techniques.

Editor™s Notes
==============
Lau is still the Super Ring Outer. Once you are caught by the knife hand or
equivalent, you better stop tapping those buttons. A dashing knife followed
by a full volley of punches and crescent would usually mean the end.

Lau's fighting style is a blend of 2 Chinese kung fu. Tiger and Swallow Fist.
Tiger Fist stresses a lot on simplicity in strokes but every stroke filled
with every ounce of force. This is evident in his knife hands and lifting
palm. It also emphasizes on "mabu" or horse stance which explains Lau's
powerful sweeps. The Swallow has speed in its strikes. You can see this
when Lau does a knife hand; the swallow "wing" can be seen on his
non-striking hand balancing his movement.

This is a very special fighting style and could have its roots on the Tiger
and Crane System of Southern Shaolin.

Fighting with Lau
=================
Lau indeed has the speed and he has the power. This is the guy that made
Jacky players re-evaluate their prowess. Mix up all your attacks. Do a
combination of high and low attacks. Do not start your combos unless your
knife hand or lifting palm hits. Both these moves either stun or lifts
opponents high into the air. There is plenty of time to float them.

Use the punches and sweep combo for opponents who are heavy or falling
fast. The punches and kickflip is good for ROs as they fling opponents far
away. At any situation, try to make the crescent in the punches and
crescent combo connect. A pounce after would end everything.

With this speed, you may think getting all these in is good enough. No!
Lau's strength is in his punches. Everyone knows that. Have Akira, Pai,
Kage or Wolf opposing you and you are going to have a difficult time. These
characters possess counter-attack moves. One grab or counter-attack and
this would end your assault.

It is here where his throws are useful. Because of his speed in punches,
most would prefer a defend and wait attitude when playing against Lau. Just
throw these defenders. His sideways throw is the most useful now. One
sideways throw leaves Lau standing and ready; a dashing knife hand connects
well straight after. If you need further damage, carry on with his punches
and insert your favorite kick here.  What you will see is Lau going totally
psycho punching the ribs of the thrown opponent.

His sweeps are powerful but use them judiciously. At longer ranges, the
sliding attack comes in handy. In fact, a single punch followed by a
sliding attack surprises many.

His side kick is still fast but with counter-attacks from other characters,
you have to use it judiciously. If a side kick connects, floating the
opponent, he can be used like Pai floating with punch combos. A side kick
that staggers are are best followed with knife hand or lifting palm combos
if you like float fests.

The dashing knife hand actually staggers many opponents. It would float
opponents if they are caught off guard making a high move. As usual float
away but many know this trick already. Before you write off this move, you
must note that Lau changes his feet position after this move. This move has
very good range and if it fails to connect, throw them if they expect you
to do punch combos.

To play with Lau is to play with caution. Learn to do his combos at the
opportune time but don't forget his basic moves.

Job            : Wrestler
Hobby          : Karaoke
Nationality    : Canada
Fighting style : Professional wrestling


VF1 Storyline
=============
He lived as a woodsman and hunter in the Canadian wilderness until he was
discovered on a scouting trip by a professional wrestling promoter. A quiet
man who loves nature, he has his gentle side. He is filled with fighting
spirit, however. Once aroused, he is not satisfied until he finishes the
job at hand.

He was an instant star in the pro wrestling area, and successfully defended
his title several times. Dissatisfied with the level of competition,
however, he turned in his belt and retired from the ring.

He entered the World Fighting Tournament in search of a rival worthy of his
abilities.

VF2 Storyline
=============
He is determined to fight against Akira again, an opponent that defeated
him at the last Tournament. For the last year, he has trained hard to
increase his already Herculean strength.

Editor™s Notes
==============
He is big and huge now. Have moves and looks of a real wrestler. He is fast
becoming a favorite among many due to all those fabulous throws.

Professional wrestling technique? Well, TV has many fine examples of pro
wrestling techniques. I don't think I need to explain this.

Fighting with Wolf
==================
As usual, go for throws. I would however go easy on the backfall suplex.
Any intended victim escapes and you are in trouble.

His aerial attacks are magnificent and deadly. Learn to defend stoutly but
insert a few attacks here and there. His uppercuts are still slow compared
to Jeffry's but his body blow has tremendous range.

Many of his moves are similar to the motions for the throws. Use this to
your advantage. The upward two-hand slap has almost the same motion for the
twirl and hurl. At close range you may get a twirl and hurl but at longer
range, you have an attack that has very good reach. This applies to his
body blow and his body slam which both apply the same control motion,
for+P.

At mid-range, his side kick is the most useful attack. More powerful than
the uppercuts, it always knocks down opponents. At close range, his knee is
good for lifting opponents into the air. If followed by an uppercut and
running punches, it would push them really far back.

Due to his great height, the sliding attack can be considered one of the
best long range "sweeps".  His sliding attack catches many by surprise. It
can be used just like Lau's sliding attack but it has greater range due to
those long legs. The last thing everyone expects is Wolf having a "sweep"
move.  Another great use of Wolf's long legs is the somersault heel smash.
While after getting up while rolling away, perform this move in preference
over the counter-roll heel slam. Very useful against fast characters
rushing in to pound Wolf.

Anytime Wolf is in trouble, he can call upon his drop elbow to assist him.
This is a wonderful move against opponents relentlessly punching hoping to
overwhelm Wolf with speed attacks.

Whenever an opponent is down, hit them with his back body splash or elbow
drop. His jumping elbow drop has very little range and should be used at
close range. The elbow drop connects easily after all his throws except for
the frankensteiner.

Be opportunistic for throws at all times. For example, anyone rising with a
low attack be it a sweep or a mule kick is asking for trouble. If the
attack misses Wolf, a tombstone, double arm suplex or a torso takedown is
all it takes to inflict damage. Use his grab side kick counter-attack if
you can. It can grab Kage's spinning mid-kick from his punches and mid-kick
combo if you time it well.

Nationality    : Australia
Fighting style : Pancractium


VF1 Storyline
=============
A fisherman on the Australian coast, he lived in the salty tang of the
tides and the hot sun. The most skillful fisherman of his village, he has
an engaging personality.

He was bested by only one opponent - the giant, eight-meter long,
man-eating Satan Shark. They fought several battles, and finally met in
their ultimate match. Jeffry was routed and his boat wrecked, but he
somehow managed to recover as he hovered on the verge of death. He entered
the World Fighting Tournament with a vow to build a new boat and do battle
with the shark again.

VF2 Storyline
=============
A fisherman who mastered Pancratium on his own. He had his newly built boat
destroyed by the evil Satan Shark. He is participating again in the
Tournament to earn him the prize money.

Editor™s Notes
==============
Like Wolf, he is huge. Does the name King Kong apply?

Pancratium (literally All Powers) was the ancient Olympic sport/martial art
of the Greeks. It included punching, kicking, and grappling. The original
Pancratium is long gone, but its spirit lives on. During the 1960s and 70s,
Jim Aravantis (Arvantis?), a Greek immigrant to the US, formalized his own
re-creation of the Pancratium which he calls Mu Tau.

Fighting with Jeffry
====================
Use him as you would for Wolf. He is a lot faster than Wolf but he recovers
just as slow. Use your lower attacks to force opponents to stand defending
making them vulnerable to your more devastating throws. His fireman's carry
would leave him entirely open if anyone should escape so I would go easy on
it too. He does have a slight advantage in this case as the escapee falls
far behind. His body press would leave him in the same vulnerable position
as Wolf's backfall suplex if the victim escapes.

His flying butt attack has great range and what better way to humiliate low
defenders than to sit on them! The best throw he has now is the
backbreaker. Though the control motions look complicated it is actually
much easier to do than the crucifix piledriver. If you fail to throw, you
would most likely get off a butt attack which is not too bad. Defend
stoutly but as usual, look for breaks for your throws. In VF2, his throws
against low defenders or attackers are very easy to do. Learn to get them
all out.

His side kick is as powerful as Wolf's but it has longer reach. Besides
side kicks, his forward foot thrust and heel axe has good range too. Use
them to your advantage. They are all rather damaging. The other moves like
the lunging elbow drop and thrusting head butt have very long reaches too.

His pounces are much faster than Wolf's. His butt bomb has much better
range but it is still not good enough. His body splash is worst. He has a
foot stomp so use it when you know opponents are rising fast. Use his
pounces only after throws or kicks that land opponents near to Jeffry. A
body splash after a side kick connects well.

Do not forget his powerful uppercuts. They are much faster and thus help
your keep opponents in the air longer.

Just keep the pressure on your opponents. Even the sight of Jeffry adds a
lot of pressure already.

Sex            : Male
Blood type     : B

Weight         : 66 kg
Job            : Ninja
Hobby          : Mahjong
Nationality    : Japan
Fighting style : Hagakure-ryu Jujutsu/Jujitsu, Hagakure style


VF1 Storyline
=============
He was born in the village of Hagakure. Kagemaru is the name given to
members of the Hagakure clan who work in secret in the shadows of society.

His birthright was to become the tenth-generation Kagemaru. His father, the
ninth-generation Kagemaru, taught him the fearsome Hagakure fighting
technique.
One day, his mother, the eighth-generation Tsukikage, was kidnapped by a
mysterious figure. Nothing was heard of her fate.

Several years later, the village of Hagakure was attacked by an unknown
force. Kagemaru and his father were out fishing, but quickly returned when
they saw the blazing village. They were too late, however, and the village
was destroyed. Kagemaru's father was felled by a bullet from the mystery
group.

The next morning, Kagemaru salvaged a keepsake from his father, donned his
costume, and embarked on a journey to prepare himself to take vengeance on
those who spilled his father's blood.

VF2 Storyline
=============
Kage whose specialty is Jujitsu, has a vendetta against the Syndicate that
killed his father. Not only did they kill his father, they also took his
mother away from him and made her as one of their fighters.

Editor™s Notes
==============
By far, the character with the greatest improvement. Most likely, he would
be called Mr Versatile (we already have a Mr Dynamite and he is Japanese
also). Makes other game ninjas look rather pale in comparison. Fast rising
as a favorite among many.

Because Kage is a ninja, he should actually use ninjitsu techniques.
Ninjitsu relies on stealth; otherwise, a dark, quiet and subtle method over
the bold, active and forceful. So ninjas actually avoid confrontations.
However, Virtua Fighter is a ring fight, so the developers cannot have Kage
popping out of nowhere to ambush his opponents. With this in mind, the game
developers made his fighting style jujitsu. Jujitsu is a generic term for a
large number of fighting skills of various styles. The ninjitsu influence
to Kage's fighting technique is the fists he makes and his reaping throw.
The Karate-like chop fists are called shuto or sword fist.

Jujitsu also known as yawara or "gentle art"; gentle, however in the sense
of yielding to an opponent's direction of attack while attempting to
control it. It began as sechie-zumo (court banquet wrestling). There are
many schools. Jujitsu declined with the collapse of the samurai class after
the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Dr Kano Jigaro studied methods of the Tenjin
Shin'yo and Kito schools that gave rise to judo. Judo is the only Oriental
martial art allowed in the Olympics as a medal event. Evidence of judo in
Kage's style of fighting is in his hip or shoulder throw and his torso
takedown.

Japanese policemen viewed judo as too sporty without much self-defense
applications. They rejected judo and adopted aikido as their form of
unarmed combat. This technique obtained much of its influence from
Daito-ryu Aikijujitsu and is developed by Morihei Ueshiba. Aikido can be
seen in Kage's defensive counter-attack for incoming punches. An aikido
exponent is often called the "eye of a hurricane", filled with peace and
tranquility, yet surrounded by a powerful field of energy. True words
indeed as this has brought fear into punching Kage.

Be aware that Hagakure is not a village or school but a fascicle manual for
samurai. The Hagakure (translated as In the Shadow of Leaves) has 1,300
short anecdotes and reflections. It is completed in 1716 and is considered
as one of the classics on bushido. Its first verse is: "The way of the
bushi is to die." 

Fighting with Kage
==================
Use his range to your advantage. His flying kick, corkscrew kick, back
thrust and heel kick have deceptively long reaches. To aid him against low
defenders, the corkscrew kick works well at far range. He doesn't have any
good combos however. The punches and kickflip is by far the best he has;
and the punches and spin kick is the weakest four hit combo in the game.

His strength is mainly in fancy and tricky moves. His turn around attacks
can connect well and above all; with his new found speed in punches, he can
be played just like Lau. Mixing up his attacks is very easy. Attacking at
high and low, this would confuse many. His most useful tagged on move is
still his backheel sweep. Though his pounces connects well now, the
backheel sweep is still good habit to keep.

His range of movement is even greater with a cartwheel added. Catching him
would be difficult if he gets ahead. To play Kage is to play the whole
ring. Movement must be a top priority for Kage players.

All his throws are so easy to do and solid. The infamous "back+P" ten foot
toss is the most useful throw in the whole game. When followed on with
attacks or combos that cover distance, ROs or KOs are really very easy.
Throws that land opponents at close range connect well with the heel smash.
Use this always.

His counter-attack counters incoming punches only. Learn to use them when
your opponent becomes to predictable. This move also grabs hopping jabs and
Akira™s single palm. It does quite sizeable damage and the heel smash is a
good follow-up.

Playing him would mean sticking to the basics. That is all to it. Combining
all those basic attacks would be the feat that every Kage player has to
develop. Combinations especially with his ten foot toss would be the
ultimate skill Kage players will have to master. Many may consider this as
cheap but these combinations are difficult to time and execute.

Hobby          : Sky diving
Nationality    : USA
Fighting style : Sekken-do/Jeet Kune Do


VF1 Storyline
==============
Sarah is Jacky's sister and the oldest daughter of the Bryant family.
Filled with curiosity, she quickly becomes embroiled in every situation
imaginable.

Sarah was suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her brother Jacky's
racing accident. When she was investigating this accident, the mystery
group kidnapped her. They use hypnosis to control her actions.

Her innate fighting sense aroused by the hypnotism, Sarah will be sent into
the Tournament to deliver the knock-out blow to her brother Jacky.

VF2 Storyline
=============
Sarah is still held captive and hypnotized. She is further trained by the
Syndicate to become the strongest fighting machine in order to kill her
elder brother Jacky.

Editor™s Notes
==============
Apart from a cleavage, she is loaded with a variety of kicks mainly. Still
a hot favorite, her speed and seemless ability to link up all her moves
have won many fans.

First a historical view of this fighting technique or rather the concept.
Jeet Kune Do is authored by Bruce Lee himself. He was influenced by the
Wing Chun fighting technique. Wing Chun means "beautiful springtime" and
originated from a nun named Ng Mui.

It is said that 5 of China's grandmasters met in the Southern Shaolin
Temple to discuss and develop a training program to produce an efficient
fighter in 5-7 years. Before the program began, the Southern Temple was
sacked and burned to the ground.

Ng Mui was the only survivor who knew the full training program. She
wandered in the countryside and took a young orphan girl Yim Wing Chun as a
student. The system then is called Mei Hua Chuan or Plum Flower Fist. It
stressed a lot on power strikes and mabu (horse stance) which suited men.
Yim Wing Chun was rather small in her stature so the style did not fit her.
She simplified the technique to involve less energy wastage. The improved
fighting style is named after Wing Chun. Wing Chun is a style that contains
many "traps"; highly evident in Sarah's elbow moves.

This style is shrouded in secrecy until grandmaster Yip Man began teaching
Wing Chun in Hong Kong during the early 50s. One of Wing Chun's students
was Bruce Lee.

What we see in VF2 is not Jeet Kune Do but Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu. Jeet Kune
Do does not rely on speed and 'irritation'. While speed is one of many
important attributes it is not the most important one, at least not for
most practitioners. Sensitivity, appreciation of distance, and timing are
much more important. While techniques such as the eye jab are used it is
generally as a way of 'bridging the gap' between ranges and as a
distraction while one sets up for another technique.

Jeet Kune Do concepts are more an analytical framework for understanding
and teaching martial arts. What you will see at the Inosanto Academy is
this understanding applied to a variety of arts. Chief among these is Lee
Jun Fan Gung Fu (the funny looking Wing Chun with Western Boxing), but Muay
Thai, Filipino Kali, other Chinese Boxing, grappling, and a number of other
things will be in evidence as well. These days you will see a lot of
Pentjak Silat and Gracie Jujitsu in the mix.

Sarah's style of fighting is very different from her brother Jacky. Though
both share the same concepts. Her knees are very Muay Thai, her shadow
kicks and jumping back roundhouse seems to be borrowed from Taekwondo. Her
elbow has Wing Chun influence.

Fighting with Sarah
===================
Playing with Sarah is like playing with Akira. Very offensive. She is fast
and this should be used to your advantage. To date, no new throws are
discovered for her. However, the bulldog throw of hers has great range.
This can be used to "encourage" opponents to stay low and be vulnerable to
Sarah's arsenal of attacks against low defenders.

The strength of Sarah is in combination not combos. Tag on all moves that
connect and you will go far with her. Her speed of movement is fast so
avoiding attacks is just a breeze. Her rising knee combo connects rather
well now and can be followed on with a kickflip. With this new speed in
VF2, Sarah has now earned the same notoriety as Lau for floating opponents.

Her turn around moves are fast and powerful. Her turn around punch followed
by any 4-hit combo would push many back. She does however have a sweep but
is only useful when her back is facing the opponent.

Her toe kick-side kick has good range and would spell trouble for all who
miss their rising attacks. The roundhouse kick can jump over many low
attacks and the same goes to the tornado kick which has even greater range.
These moves recover slowly and should be used when the opportunity allows.

Sarah does not side kick opponents. She shadow kicks them. If a side kick
could hit at close range, make sure you shadow kick them. Most likely all
the three kicks will connect making it a very powerful side kick attack.

Do not give them any room at all. Punch-throw techniques work like a charm
with her and; low kicks and punches do very well too.

VF1 Storyline
=============
The eldest son of the Bryant family, Jacky is Sarah's brother. He maintains
his cool in every situation. Those on the Indy racing circuit call him the
Blue Flash.

Jacky was seriously injured in an accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500,
and spent two years in a grueling rehabilitation program. Just when his
injury had healed, he discovered the existence of the mystery group behind
the accident. At the same time, his sister Sarah disappeared.

Jacky's battle began as he pursued the trail of the group who held the key
to these mysteries.

VF2 Storyline
=============
During the last Tournament, he was not really himself. He was defeated and
he went back training and improving his skills. Now he is an instructor in
Jeet Kune Do.

As his second effort to seek revenge on the Syndicate and rescue his sister
Sarah; he participates again in the Tournament

Editor™s Notes
==============
The favorite character of VF1 is still a favorite with many but is toned
down a lot. Still deadly though. If you play him with the intent to win,
you have to play him mechanically. Be prepared to be despised by other
players if you play a purely mechanical Jacky.

In his technique, you can find Karate as in the back sweep and turning back
roundhouse. Taekwondo is evident in the last kick of his lightning kicks.
His elbow technique, like Sarah's, is Wing Chun.

Fighting with Jacky
===================
He is still not the best at everything. However, like Sarah, combinations
are the way to go.

His elbow-heel kick is not fearsome anymore as with his punt kick, but his
beat knuckle is really bad for everyone. He still does not possess a
kickflip combo but his kickflip alone is the most powerful kickflip in the
game. Able to take as much as eighty percent of the lifebar, it has left
many wondering why the round ended so fast.

His spinning backfists, both high and low are much faster. The low spinning
backfist especially can be considered as some form of counter-attack as it
can duck under many punches. A deadly combination for Jacky involves a low
spinning backfist. As opponents charge in punching, do a single low
backfist, elbow, knee then kickflip. This drains the entire lifebar in an
instant. Such is the power of Jacky.

Combine all his moves. Try to get the trip and hammer throw in and kick
them. His turn around moves are nice to see especially when they connect
but use them carefully. This applies to his crescent and sweep; and the low
spinning kick as well. His lightning kicks is best used sparingly. Try to
do one or two lightning kicks as they would most likely stun opponents.

Play a balanced game of offense and defense. Play him a little like Pai and
Sarah. Use combos to deter throwers and counter mainly with his low
spinning backfist. You can try using all the fancy stuff he has but don't
be overwhelmed by them. However, using his fancy stuff requires much higher
amount of skill and adds color to fights. Spectators are bored quickly with
a mechanical Jacky doing low backfists, elbows, heel kicks, side kicks and
kickflips. Though many players hold these moves as effective ways to win,
one must note that winning in style (like floating) wins many cheers.

Combinations with the lightning kicks and his very difficult toe kick, side
kick move is often hailed as a mark of an excellent Jacky player.

VF1 Storyline
=============
None

VF2 Storyline
=============
He is from Northern China and is considered as a sage by many. He teaches
in his small training hall and had many students in the past but most have
left him by now. This is due to his keen interest in taking students able
to take hardship as part of the training.

While drinking with his friends, Shun hears them boasting about the success
one of their student fighters (Akira) in recent tournament competitions. He
suddenly exclaims, "I also want to participate in the World Fighting
Tournament". Shun's friends pleaded with him not to, but once Shun had
mentioned his intent to fight, he was adamant and eventually joined the
tournament.

Editor™s Notes
==============
There are many bald characters in the video games lately like Wan Fu and
Nienhalt Sieger. Wonder if it is a trend or do bald guys really rule.

Drunken Fist also known as the 8 Drunken Immortals is based on moves from 8
Immortals from Chinese mythology. It is a Northern Chinese Style.

This fighting style requires the exponent (not player) to be drunk in the
mind but alert in the body. It stresses more on defensiveness. Ducking and
jumping over attacks. This is true as most of Shun's moves are defensively
offensive (what the hell am I talking about?). They jump, duck and dodge
many attacks. His two hand upside-down push ducking under punches is a fine
example.

Fighting with Shun
==================
To play him, you have to be totally unpredictable. Stop combos or attacks
with you backpush. It attacks REALLY LOW so that elbows and knees seldom
hit you. The only moves that stand a chance are toe kicks, punt kick; and
kickflips against this move.

Use his jumping attacks like the twisting hook punch to hop over low and
mid-level attacks. You have to be completely reactionary in your execution.
You have to be alert all throughout and have to have good reflexes. You
can't do a lot of planning for Shun. Play as the situation goes. You can't
outguess opponents either so reflexes are the way. For example, his
cartwheel kick is fast but recovers slowly.  Use this to stop charging
opponents hoping to connect with a throw.

His falling moves can be good too. These moves evade power attacks after
and the only vulnerable thing is a punch or kick to fallen opponents. Not
much damage will be done with these moves on Shun. Nobody would be crazy
enough to pounce. His rising rotorblade kicks get anyone jumping in. This
is due to Shun™s amazing ability to get up faster than anyone.

His fancy sit down and handstand moves are very disruptive to charging
attackers. Besides these two move, the backward hopping kicks are a bane to
many inexperienced in handling Shun. This move, is quite fast and hits
those who fail their low-level attacks or those closing in recklessly.

As much as possible, dodge attacks if you are a beginner and learn to do
the dodge followed by the dances with punches. Progress onwards to learn
the rest. Note that all his moves are slow and recover slowly; and if you
play him like any other character in VF2, you are playing him wrong. He can
float opponents in some limited way but that is not his main strength.

His dashing punch can be used in just the same way as Akira's dashing palm.
Most inexperienced players do not expect this move and think that a
squatting Shun is easy meat. This move floats opponents very well and can
be followed by the twisting kicks or cartwheel kick.

Both his pounces actually inflict the same amount of damage. The only
difference is that the high pounce has longer range due to the roll
forward. Therefore, use the low pounce in preference over the high pounce.
It is fast.

Progress on to hone your reflexes for all his moves. Try to use the dances
with punches and two hand upside-down push at least three times in a match.
Get him drunk (SERIOUS!). His skin complexion turns lobster red the more he
drinks. The following happens when he has:

One drink - able to do down+P+K sweep. Able to do a foot slide after
sitting down, instead of a low kick. His back+P and down+P looks slightly
different.

Two drinks - able to do down+P+K, K sweeps. His back/down+D, P will become
a side step backwards and two-hand side push. His back+P and down+P changes
and again looks slightly different.

Three drinks - able to do down+P+K, K, K sweeps. His back+P and down+P move
changes again.

In addition, the power of his connected attacks increase by 5% after each
drink. The maximum is reached after eight drinks. At the maximum, his moves
will inflict 1.4 times more damage than what he starts out with in a round.
This is evident in his low backpush. Without drinking, this move just
irritates standing defenders. After drinking, the move has the ability to
knock them down. So don't stop at the third drink. Drink as much as you
can.




Lion Rafale

Date of birth  : 24th December 1979
Sex            : Male
Blood type     : AB
Height         : 1.71 m
Weight         : 61 kg
Job            : High School student
Hobby          : Collecting knives
Nationality    : France
Fighting style : Toru-ken/Seven Stars Mantis Fist


VF1 Storyline
=============
None

VF2 Storyline
=============
Having been born to the Rafale family, one of the most wealthy families in
France. They are involved in the aircraft industry and at the same time
secretly developing arms behind their official business. Lion has been
practising Toru-ken under an instructor as part of management education from
his childhood. He resents his father's control over his life and during one
of their arguments, his father proposed to Lion to win the World Fighting
Tournament as a prerequisite to become free from him. Thus Lion is
participating in the tournament competition.

Editor™s Notes
==============
This Frenchman has a lot of sting as a fighter. He has youth on his side
but is rather weak in most of his attacks. Nimble and small, he fights and
moves like the bug his fighting style is based upon.

Praying Mantis Fist also called Wong Long Fist is invented by a Chinese
boxer named Wong Long. He became distraught after losing so many fights, so
he retreated to a forest to meditate. One day, during one of his meditation
sessions,  he saw a mantis fighting with a grasshopper. Though the mantis
is smaller (should be a male mantis, a female mantis is the size of a
grasshopper), he was amazed by its ability to attack with quick strikes
with its "arms". So amazed with it, he brought the insect home and "fought"
with it using twigs to study it. He then developed movements based on the
insect and he named the fighting style after it.

Soon a variation came forth from it called Seven Stars Mantis Fist based on
the Chinese constellation. This is Lion's fighting technique. His spinning
arms attack is not found in the original Mantis Fist but in this variant.
Mantis Fist like Drunken Fist is one of the Northern Shaolin Styles.

Mantis Fist stress not only in speed but also in footwork and grip. This
explains the many wierd ways Lion moves his feet around and the way he
throws his opponents. He winds up and fights in a crouched position which
looks very tiring.

It is interesting to know that Rafale is the name of an advanced, agile
multi-role fighter produced by a European consortium; in which French
aerospace companies had a big stake in.

Fighting with Lion
==================
Playing Lion would mean playing closing-in with hit and run tactics. All
his moves enable him to close-in very fast. He is small so he doesn't have
much reach. His main strength is actually his throws. They are fast and
difficult to avoid. As much as possible practice his ducking moves.  It is
very useful as many attacks just zip past his head. Fight a balanced game
like you are using Jacky but concentrate on throws at close range. At
further ranges, his spinning to the opponents side counter-attacks are a
good option. This move confuses many.

His side kicks are the fastest so use them to your advantage. He does have
a knee but it comes out slow; definitely not recommended for low defenders.
Rely more on his faster recovering moves. The uppercut and downward swipe
is good and fast. His long range spinning sweeps are deceptive as one hits
standing defenders and the other hits low defenders. Use this creatively as
an illusion. 

His speed is his greatest asset so keep that in mind. Backing off from
attacks is pretty easy with him. However, go easy on his low attacks. They
are fast but recover slow.

It is difficult to float opponents with Lion so you might as well forget
it. The best he can muster is the low swipe kicks, one hand-stand kicks and
his arm spin for falling opponents. However, his knee connects very well on
already airborne opponents. He does not have much combos to muster against
airborne opponents other than the punch, elbow thrust and backfist combo.
