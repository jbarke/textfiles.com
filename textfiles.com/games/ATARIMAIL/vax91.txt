Jed;

	I forgot to mention that I am going out to field test in February
with the 2105 comm boards AND SA audio.  This means I will need to solve
the problem I am having with the SCOM interrupt and the comm board interrupt.
Any ideas for a short term solution?

Subj:	GSP time outs with DSPlink


Jed;

	We are getting GSP time outs when the DSPlink PCB is installed.  Is
there anything that this board may interfer with to cause this?  Does the
DSP interrupt have higher priority that the ADSP interrupt or something to
interfer with info going to the GSP?

	I will try disconnecting the DSPlink until I can isolate the problem.

I spoke to Howard Randall at Manco, the Rep for Arium.

He says that Arium continues to sell and support the Arium Echo Dev. system.

He says Arium is focusing manpower on their logic analyzer line so there is
no effort underway to support additional processors with the Arium Echo.
This may have lead to the rumors here at Atari that Arium is longer supporting
the Echo which others interpreted to mean it is no longer available.

Howard says production, sales, and support of the Arium Echo will continue
indefinitely.

Subj:	Hot Processor at Great Price!?

Here is a message Tim sent me - sounds exciting. My comments follow...
From:	KIM::HUBBERSTEY    8-JAN-1991 12:15:46.26
To:	DOWNEND
Subj:	New 68000 development tools


I would like to suggest that we make sure any new tools will support some of
the new processors Motorola is planning. At least one of them, the 68EC020,
looks very interesting. The 68EC020 is a reduced cost version of the 68020 
(EC stands for Embedded Control) that reduces the address bus to 24 bits and
removes co-processor support so it can fit in a cheaper 100-pin package. It has
a maximum clock speed of 25MHz. It's availability is slated for 2nd quarter
this year (although who believes Motorola's release dates?) and is targetted
for $15 in our quantities. Given that we are currently paying $13 for 16MHz
68000s this sounds very interesting. 
			Tim

    ............................end of Tim's message......................
This is exciting and frustrating at the same time. I am pretty sure NONE
of the 68000/68010 emulators will support the 68020 processor. The jump from
16 to 32 bit data is too much for them. So what do you do? Wait for something
like the the 68EC020 to make it into our designs or buy new equipment now?
Sometimes any action is better than no action even it turns out to be
wrong in a year or two. In spite of the emulator problem, I would certainly
encourage new hardware designs to consider processors with the 
power/price ratio  offered by the 68EC020.  It should be approached as 
a choice for the whole department with the intention of standardizing
most future designs upon it.  Tim also mentioned a 683xx processor which
also offers greater speed while retaining much of the 68000 architecture.
New purchases should be evaluted in terms of supporting that processor as well.

I was just writing the date on a drawing when I noticed the coincidence.
No big deal, just a cute observation. But, now that I think of it, this

This should be a holiday. Let's all go home and celebrate.

Subj:	PCB parts lists


Jed:
	I have an answer to your problems re. PCB parts lists not being
available. Jeff Bell told me for over a year the SCIcards-generated parts lists
have been copied over to the PARTSLIST: directory (it's on Bert, in case you're
interested).  Those files are plain ASCII except for the first line, which is
extra long.  If you do a directory of partslist:*.sc, you'll see there are 59
files in that directory.  The other zillions of parts lists in that directory
are WordMARC format, of course.  Probably the reason you couldn't find a SCI-
cards parts lists yesterday was because it hadn't been released yet.  Not until
it's released does it get copied over to that directory.

	The three assemblies Ralph Perez used for the Compact link programs are:
		A048979-01	North American
		A048979-02	British
		A048979-03	German
The link assemblies above are listed on the A048980-xx parts list. Hope this
info helps you.

Subj:	Strategy Brainstorming! RSVP by Friday night!


You are invited to a brainstorming session, currently scheduled 
for Wednesday, Jan. 16 from 12:00 to 2:00.

The focus of the session will be on corporate strategy. For example:
	
	What does Atari do?
	What does Atari do better than our competitors?
	What are our unique advantages?
	How can we capitalize on these advantages?
	What areas do we want to explore?
	What new capabilities should be developed?
	etc.

We will have approximately 10 people in each group. The 
moderators will be chosen from the Engineering and Marketing 
Directors (Rick Moncrief, Pete Takaichi, Chris Downend, Mary 
Fujihara, and yours truly).

If you are interested in attending, please RSVP by VAX to RAY 
by end of day tomorrow (Friday). I will organize the 
participants into "well-rounded" groups and assign moderators 
by Tuesday. You will receive details of your meeting place and 
moderator on Tuesday.

Subj:	ZOOM/shadows/ground avoidance


	I have been asked by the lawyers if there are any games out there
that have used any one of the following features.  If you could provide me
with any information that would be appreciated.

     1. Player selectable Zoom.  I have seen a Sega sitdown that used a zoom 
	to move to and from the cockpit of a jet but it was not controllable.
	What is the name of this game?  Are there other games with a zoom?

     2. Terrain following shadows.  I believe the game Zaxxon and F-15 used 
	shadows to give the player a height.  Are there any others that 
	provided a shadow that followed the terrain?

     3.	Automatic ground avoidance.  I believe F-15 and others prevented the 
	player from flying into the ground (vertical avoidance).  Are there
	any other games like this?  Are there any games that detected terrain
	in front of the player and helped the player avoid that terrain in
	any way?

							Thanks

Subj:	Here we go...


	Well somebody has to do it.. (2 days to go).

	Once we go to war there will be no turning back. There will be sons and 
daughters and fathers and mothers killed. There will be thousands of Americans
killed and thousands more disfigured so that their lives will never be the same.
It may be a fast war, it may be a decisive war, but no war is a clean war.

	The Arabs may or may not remember that Hussein attacked Kuwait but they
will most certainly remember the Arabs killed when the allied forces attack.
If we destroy Iraq there will be millions of refugees. They will not be looking
at America as their savior.

	Going to war represents a major defeat for the administration. All the 
talk about a "single voice" in the U.S. being the single greatest chance for 
peace is just so much B.S. when the war starts. 

	I believe that sanctions should be given more time. One possible action
at this time is a full military blockade, stopping all air, sea and ground 
transport into and out of Iraq. This is technically an act of war, but it will 
kill many fewer people.


					Peace,

						JFS

Subj:	2 WW 2105 PCBs


Jed;

	I will need 2 more WW 2105 serial boards for my Field Test cabinet.
Should we use the current design I am using or do you want to do 4 new WW
boards (2 to replace the ones we are using in the lab)?  I would like to get 
them started in the done in the next two weeks.

Subj:	PAL for DSK board


At one time you said you might be able to change a PAL on the DSK and give
me the full address range in the pair of 512's there rather than half the range
which I can use now.  Are you planning on doing this, and if so when?

Subj:	DSK Addressing


No, I don't have time to redo the DSK addressing. I don't have time now; 
I don't expect to have time later.

Leon has started the layout of the Expanded Memory Board and will
probably be done next week. We will probably be able to get boards
on a two week turn-around.

Subj:	RACE DRIVIN LINK UPDATE KIT INSTRUCTIONS


I already returned my copy of the instruction manual to Andrea; however,
Elaine may want to ask operators to return the old EPROMs for credit.  She
will be reviewing this with Bob Stewart to see if it is worth the trouble.

Since we are not charging customers for the kit, it makes it difficult 
to send them a credit.  Also, our accounting system is not set up to give 
credits back directly to operators.  Basically, we would be buying EPROMs
directly from operators.

O.K.  FOR ALL OF YOU WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT ONE OF LAST FRIDAY'S HEALTH
INSURANCE MEETINGS BUT WEREN'T, OR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE THERE BUT ARE
STILL CONFUSED OR HAVE QUESTIONS, THEN HERE IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.  A NWNL
REPRESENTATIVE WILL AGAIN BE IN THE CAFETERIA TOMORROW FROM 10:00 TIL NOON TO
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.  THIS IS NOT A MEETING, BUT A COME-AS-YOU-ARE-WHEN-YOU-

YOU KNOW THOSE FADED RED SHORTS AND THAT TATTERED ATARI SHIRT OF YOURS?  YEAH,
THE ONES YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AROUND SINCE YOU STOPPED PLAYING VOLLYBALL LAST
SUMMER.  WELL, I THINK I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, AND PROBABLY ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS
COME WITHIN 10 FEET OF THE LOCKERS IN THE MEN AND/OR WOMENS RESTROOMS.

IT HAS BECOME QUITE GROSS IN BOTH THE LOCKER ROOMS AND THE EXERCISE ROOM AT
TIMES, SO ON FEBRUARY 1, AND EVERY FRIDAY THEREAFTER, THE LOCKERS  WILL BE
CLEANED OUT.  WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING LEFT IN THEM WILL BE DISPOSED OF.

SO LET'S JUMP ON THE "BETTER OUR ENVIRONMENT" BANDWAGON AND MAKE THIS A MORE
FRAGRANT AND NEATER PLACE TO WORK.

an existing Northwestern subscriber, you need to complete the re-enrollment

need to complete an enrollment form for one of the Northwestern plans or
Kaiser.

If you have questions, please contact either Sandi or myself or stop by the
cafeteria between 10:00 am an Noon and talk to the Northwestern National
representative.

$ BOM :== $ scicom:plist
SCICOM should already be in your login.

Type BOM /HELP for information about the switch options.
You need to run the VIEWDATA portion on the PC first. See Art, Leon, 
Joe or me if you need help to get started.

Here is the help information from the program. As always please 
report problems and bugs. 
Engineers. Use the /eng switch to generate a parts list format 
suitable for Tims COSTPL program using the MANPL option.

The PLIST command format is : 

 PLIST project assy#-version/rev (eg a012345-01a)

 optional : /add /create /eng /goto /help /keep='level' 
            /local_xref /print /show='level' 

 Only the first letter after the / is significant. 

 project : The name of the project .bom file. 
 assembly/rev# : The assembly number and revision of the parts list to create.
 
	The following switches are optional. 
 /add : If the assembly is not fount in the .AO file, then add it.
 /create : If the .ao file is not found then create it.
 /engineer : produce engineering parts list only.
 /goto=n : Skip beginning procedures 
 /help : this message. 
 /keep='level' : What to do with temporary files
 		level can be ALL SOME NONE or a number.
 /local_xref : do not copy or use the master plist_xref.dat file 
 /print : print an existing pl on the documemntation printers. 
 		the project name is ignored.
 /show='level' : How much information to display on the screen.
 		level can be ALL SOME NONE or a number.

	My apologies to those of you who use GAWD.  I started
a batch job last night before I left, which was supposed to take
about 8 hours.  This morning I found it still running because the
backup was run last night, and my job did not get much time.  I
am setting the priority lower so it will not interfere with other
jobs being submitted today.

	Again, I apologize.  I did not mean to run this processor
intensive job during the day.

Subj:	Furniture for sale


Is one of your New Year's resolutions to organize your hifi and TV setup?
If so, I have two solutions.  I am selling my TV/VCR cart and Scandinavian oak
hi-fi cabinet.  I'm buying an entertainment unit that will hold everything, and
it's due here in mid-February. Therefore, these two items will be available in
about 2 weeks.

TV CART: High-quality medium-dark wood laminate with rounded corners, casters,
and open shelf below for a VCR. The shelf is reversible: one side has the wood
laminate, the other side has a cane look. Perfect condition. (I have a picture
of this cart in my office.)  $25.

HI-FI CABINET: Medium-gold tight-grained oak with radiused front edges; ample
room for 3 components inside, and 4 compartments for records at the bottom. A
turntable fits on top. Wood is in immaculate condition.  This cabinet had a
smoke glass door, which no longer exists. I got a quote from a local glass shop
to have a new piece of glass cut for $54. I still have all the silver-colored
door hardware.  Remote controls work through the smoke glass, by the way.  Open
back allows for easy cable connections.  23 1/8" w x 18 1/8" D x 38" H. $60, or
negotiable with new glass door.

Subj:	14/7MHz 680x0 processors


With the increase in the number of 14MHz 68000 games we have here, I think I
should point out a potential problem area. While it is obvious to all (I hope)
that you can't run a board at 14MHz with an 8MHz 68000, it is also true that
you shouldn't run a board at 7MHz with a 16MHz processor. This is because the
faster parts have a MINIMUM clock speed requirement of 8MHz. If you do run a
fast part at this speed you may encounter flakey operation, particularly when
the part gets hot.

So . . . The bottom line is when you grab a 68000 to stuff into your board
make sure it is the right speed for the job. This goes especially for the
processors in the Arium and AMS emulator pods since they typically run much
hotter than processors on a board.

I'm looking for an Imagewriter I or II for my mother. Who's looking into
getting a Mac Classic.  If you have one you're l
thinking of getting rid of (especially those of you with laserwriters)
please keep me in mind.

Thanks in advance,

The City of Milpitas is throwing them out because this area is not
zoned retail.

Tomorrow is the last day they are open to the public.

(This file lives in ee$userdisk:[68k_us.memo]common_bugs.txt)

WHO NEEDS TO READ THIS: every game programmer and every project leader
    whose game programmer says he/she has none of these bugs (they're lying).
    Hardware engineers might also find it a useful refresher.

	I have been doing a lot of poking around in dusty corners lately,
    trying to move people from older coin and eeprom routines to newer ones.
    In the process I have discovered a few bugs and "accidents waiting to
    happen". Each is described below, although I'm not claiming that they are
    new or that I didn't create some of them myself. First some background.
    Most of our games have (at least) two levels of interrupt. Some games add
    an extra level of "software interrupt" or "foreground". Others have
    multiple processors (you don't? how about that 6502 on your sound board?)
    All these things mean that the statements of a program are often executed
    in a different order than one might expect from the source listing. Keeping
    things on track requires a certain degree of (dare I say it) discipline.
    NOTE: These are not the only bugs in our code. They are just ones I have
    seen often, or lately. Each topic below is presented as: subject, 
    background, the bug, and suggested changes.

    					Mike

SUBJECT: unrelated functions sharing a latch

BACKGROUND:

	Our hardware guys are very fond of grouping miscellaneous bits
    together in four-, six-, or eight- bit latches. They are unlikely to
    change because a) it's cheaper b) it's not _that_ much of a hassle,
    usually and c) it's now the "standard". The problem arises because these
    latches are write-only, so they need to be shadowed. Unfortunately, when
    a game has two programmers (or one programmer in two different moods or
    seasons), there tend to be two (or more) shadows for the same latch. Also,
    we don't always take care about order of update or possible interrupts.

THE BUG:

	Failure to use a single shadow, or to "guard" references to that
    shadow, leads to random setting/clearing of bits. This is especially
    prevalent in the _added_at_the_last_minute vcr code, which may, for
    example, change the resolution of your LETA...

THE FIX:

	A single routine that has its own shadow and disables interrupts
    while mucking with it. the one below is called to set a some bits by:

	mod_latch( FIRST_BIT | OTHER_BIT );

    and called to clear the same bits by:

	mod_latch( ~( FIRST_BIT | OTHER_BIT ) );

    and it assumes that there is only one such latch, of up to 31 bits.
    The actual code snippet below assumes a 16-bit latch (and shadow), but
    all the '.W's could be '.B' or '.L' for 8 or 31 bits.

	It is _probably_ a real good idea if the latch address and the shadow
    address were _not_ available to anybody else, to "put some teeth" in the
    "convention" of using this routine.

-------- sample code follows --------

	xdef	mod_latch
*	Modifies LATCH according to its param. If MSB set, clears any bits
*	that are clear in the param, else sets any that are set. NOTE: this
*	is the reverse of the original (ROMALOT) mod_latch, but nobody was
*	using that, and this is a more intuitive interface.
mod_latch:
	MOVE	SR,D1
	OR	#$700,SR	* Lock INTS
	MOVE.L	4(SP),D0	* Read parameter LONG
	BMI.S	ML10		* D31 signals 0: OR in bits  1:AND out bits
	OR.W	bitshd,D0
	BRA.S	ML20
ML10:	AND.W	bitshd,D0
ML20:	MOVE.W	D0,LATCH	Set LATCH
	MOVE.W	D0,bitshd	update shadow
	MOVE	D1,SR
	RTS

SUBJECT: Spinning on eer_busy() in Vblank

BACKGROUND:

	Many of our games use EEPROM to hold statistics, High Scores, etc.
    One problem with EEPROM is that each byte (typically) takes time to
    write. This is normally handled by having a routine ( eer_hwt() ) that
    is called every VBlank actually do the write. If the test switch is
    changed while the game is writing, corrupt data could result. So, a
    routine ( eer_busy() ) is supplied to tell when it is safe to "turn over"
    the game from test to game or vice-versa.

THE BUG:

	Somewhere, sometime, somone decided that the code to do this
    should look roughly like:

VBLANK_IRQ:
	<save some regs and hit VBACK>
	TST.W	INSELF
	BEQ		<go handle game Vblank>
* We think we are in selftest, does the switch agree?
	IFTST	<proceed with selftest version of Vblank routine>
* We need to transit from test to game.
VB0:    JSR		eer_busy
	TST.L	D0
	BNE	VB0
< code to fake a reset, which will find the test switch off and start game>

    A similar piece of code is used when the game vblank finds the test switch
    on. Since an EEPROM write can make no progress with Vblank IRQs essentially
    disabled, the eer_busy() will, if it ever returns TRUE, continue to do so
    forever (or until WATCHDOG kicks in).

THE FIX:

	Don't just hang. Work towards finishing the write by calling eer_hwt()
    every Vblank until eer_busy() returns 0. This will let the game program
    continue too, until it is safe to "turn over".

VBLANK_IRQ:
	<save some regs and hit VBACK>
	TST.W	INSELF
	BEQ		<go handle game Vblank>
* We think we are in selftest, does the switch agree?
	IFTST	<proceed with selftest version of Vblank routine>
* We need to transit from test to game.
	JSR		eer_busy
	TST.L	D0
	BEQ	DIE
	JSR	eer_hwt
	<restore regs>
	RTI

DIE:
< code to fake a reset, which will find the test switch off and start game>

    Incidentally, this is essentially what SYSTEM I originally did. I have no
    idea how the buggy code arose, but I have seen it in several games now.

SUBJECT: VBACK, who hits it and when

BACKGROUND:

	Most of our hardware designs generate an interrupt at the beginning
    of Vertical Blank. Most also have an address to "strobe" to acknowledge
    (and clear) this interrupt. Three warnings:

1)  VAD-based systems cannot tolerate random gunk being stored in VBACK, always
    store a zero. You may want to use a CLR instruction but...

2)  If you are using a 68010 in development and a 68000 in production, make
    sure your VBACK can tolerate being read (modern VADS can) because the
    68000 (but not the 68010) does a read-modify-write cycle for CLR.W

3)  Some games will generate another IRQ at line 256 if you strobe VBACK
    "too soon" (i.e. between lines 240 and 256).

THE BUG:

    Several annoyances, mainly related to lunching VADS and getting spurious
    double Vblanks, which may have the side effect of inducing EEPROM errors.

THE FIX:

    Make sure you are writing the proper value, and preferably late, rather
    than early in your Vblank IRQ routine.

SUBJECT: How to set your priority level from C.

BACKGROUND:

	Sometimes a routine written in C needs to disable interrupts during
    a "critical section". Since the MOVE xxx,SR instruction is not available
    in C, various snippets of assembly have been making the rounds.

THE BUG:

	One of these snippets goes something like:

OLD_IPL: DS.W	1
	...
	xdef	ints_off,ints_on
ints_off:
	MOVE.W	SR,OLD_IPL	; Save old value of Interrupt priority
	MOVE.W	6(SP),SR	; Set new value from parameter
	RTS
ints_on:
	MOVE.W	OLD_IPL,SR
	RTS

    This works fine until the day that a mainline routine does an
    ints_off(0x2200) (saving 20xx in OLD_IPL), then is itself interrupted
    (say at level 4) by a routine that does an ints_off(0x2600), saving
    22xx in OLD_IPL. BOTH calls to ints_on will "restore" the 22xx, leaving
    the "mainline" at level 2 forever. I've seen a variation on this theme
    which maintains a complicated stack in "private" memory, but does not
    check for consistency or stack overflow.

THE FIX:

	Work with, rather than against, the language. The following:

	xdef	set_ipl

set_ipl:
	MOVEQ.L	#0,D0			; Not _strictly_ needed, but tidy
	MOVE.W	SR,D0
	MOVE.W	6(SP),SR
	RTS

    can be used in conjunction with a local variable in the procedure calling
    it:

void
foo()
{
    int old_ipl;
    ...
    old_ipl = set_ipl(#COMM_LEVEL)
    ...
    (void) set_ipl(old_ipl);
}

SUBJECT: is "foreground" really vblank?

BACKGROUND:

	Many of our games use an "interrupt level" between the lowest priority
    real interrupt and "background". This typically handles things that really
    should happen once a frame (like animation drivers), but are not critically
    dependant on the beam position. The Vblank IRQ routine checks to see if the
    "foreground" is active. If not, it is "activated" by marking it active,
    lowering the interrupt priority level, and "calling" the foreground. When
    the foreground returns, the IPL is once again raised, the "active" flag
    is cleared, and Vblank returns. If Vblank finds the foreground already
    active, it simply returns.

THE BUG:

	Sometimes the VBlank routine does not lower its IPL, making the entire
    foreground routine essentially part of the Vblank IRQ. Another problem
    is covered below.

THE FIX:

	Make sure the sequence of operations detailed above is followed, and
    that Vblank can be re-entered safely.

SUBJECT: BIG "critical sections"

BACKGROUND:

	In just about any game there are "critical sections", where we need
    to ensure that only one routine is mucking about with a given data
    structure. For quick changes to small pieces of data, simply raising the
    IPL will work just fine, but some games leave interrupts masked for
    multiple frames, to keep "foreground" from running while a large routine
    runs in "background".

THE BUG:

	When VBlank is left masked for a long time, operations that actually
    need to be done during the blanking interval will actually get done at an
    essentially random time. The hardware may or may not allow this. Also if
    Vblank is left masked for a long time, the result may be two "back to back"
    Vblank interrupts, with subsequent errors in writes to the EEPROM.

THE FIX:

	If you need to prevent the foreground from running, "mark" it in the
    same way Vblank does. Since presumably this is done in "background", there
    should be no hazards. If you really need to mask interrupts for a long
    time, perhaps you need to re-think the data structure and associated
    critical sections.

SUBJECT: 6502 reading test-switch considered harmful

BACKGROUND:

	For reasons lost in the mists of time, the sound processor (6502)
    has its own input for reading the test switch. Among other changes, the
    "coin read exception" will return current values of the coin inputs,
    rather than the "modulo four counters" if the test switch is found on.
    The main processor also reads the test switch, and can, therefore, have
    a different opinion about whether the pair are in "game" or "test" mode.

THE BUG:

	When the test switch is switched on after some coins have been
    deposited, there is a 1 in 4 chance of "seeing" an extraneous coin on
    each mech. This will occur when the number of coins seen by a mech,
    modulo four, is three, because the 6502 will change to reporting '0',
    which is in fact the next valid value for the mech. The "credit" thus
    earned cannot usually be spent, since the main processor should see
    the test switch soon thereafter, but the EEPROM count of coins will
    be off from both the Electro-mechanical counters and the number of
    coins in the cashbox. Also, there is the possibility of a more permanent
    fault leading to bizarre behavior.

THE FIX:

	There are a variety of options, ranging from converting to a scheme
    of "modulo three" counters, with zero a "forbidden value" to having a
    different exception for "raw coin switch" to having a command to set
    the 6502 in "test mode" rather than giving it access to the test switch.
    I welcome and solicit comment, but would frankly prefer all three...

SUBJECT: calling eer_incs() et al. from interrupt level

BACKGROUND:

	There are a number of routines in both the coin and eeprom code
    that cannot be safely re-entered. I also cannot make all of them
    "critical sections" because of deadly-embrace possibilties when called
    an arbitrary number of times from who-knows-where in a game.

THE BUG:

	Calling certain routines with interrupts masked (like, from your
    VBlank routine) can lead to a deadly embrace. The most likely candidates
    are eer_incs() and cn_credits(). They are only most likely because you
    are most likely to want to call them then, although it never seems to
    be really needed.

THE FIX:

	Don't!

SUBJECT: calling com_[f]wrt() with an exception, or com_exc() with a command

BACKGROUND:

	RPM accepts two kinds of "commands". The vast majority of them are
    inserted in a queue when received, to be processed as soon as the main
    loop has time. A special form, called an "exception" is processed as
    soon as it is received, and requires special handling. The code in
    RPMSLV.MAC (6502) and SND_COM.ASM (68000) take special pains to make
    everything work. This work is subverted when a game programmer uses
    com_exc() to send a "normal" command, or (more usually) uses com_[f]wrt()
    to send an exception.

THE BUG:

	Mis-using these routines (as the handed-down-for-generations sound
    test code does, among others) can lead to spurious and/or lost coins.
    It is the number one reason for such spurious coins, despite 6+ years
    of my lectures.

THE FIX:

	Use com_wrt() or com_fwrt() for normal commands, com_exc() for
    exceptions. If your old code from games gone by does not do this, fix it.
    While you are at it, make sure you check the return value from com_wrt()
    if you care whether or not it succeeded. Hardware guys might consider
    adding a (low priority) interrupt for comm_buffer_empty (maskable by
    writing a latch bit, of course) to speed up "queued" output with the
    sort of horrifying kluges I have glimpsed.

SUBJECT: Who hits watchdog and when

BACKGROUND:

	I may not have been the one who brought the "Watchdog" to Atari,
    but Rich Patak and I were the first I know of to have used one in a game
    here. The basic idea is simple. If you can determine an upper bound on
    the amount of "processing time" in your "main loop", you can have a timer
    that will reset the CPU if it is not reset at least that frequently. As
    a first approximation, this works fine, but there are a few problems.
    Concessions to cost lead to watchdog circuits with a period of 128
    milliseconds or so, while our games sometimes have sections (particularly
    in initialization) longer than this. Also, our emulators often have
    problems with watchdog, so it is disabled during most of the development
    cycle, being tested as the game is going out the door.

THE BUG (1):

	In an attempt to get around the tight timing of watchdog, some folks
    hit it in their Vblank IRQ. While this solves one problem, it creates
    another. In the absence of software "sanity checks", the mainline of a
    game can be "insane" and effectively hung up, while the Vblank routine
    is just fine and will never be reset.

THE FIX (1):

	Add some sort of "sanity check", if only on such things as "stack
    pointer in bounds" or a longer interval software managed timer. A really
    spiffy scheme might include a software timer set at every "state
    transition" to the maximum length of the state, and a "scanner" to check
    critical data structures "in the background".

THE BUG (2):

	As a quasi-religious reaction to bug (1), some folks shun hitting
    watchdog in Vblank at all, prefering to sprinkle watchdog hits semi-
    randomly through their code. Unfortunately, the choice of when and where
    is made without much time (remember, watchdog is usually disabled until
    management is breathing down your neck to release), and even choices that
    worked once may be invalidated by late changes in "tuning". In the face
    of these difficulties, a programmer often sprinkles enough "hits" to
    ensure that watchdog will never "bite", no matter how tangled the game
    gets, thus again effectively disabling it.

	The near-random nature of the "sprinkling" can cause other problems
    too. A few weeks ago I fixed a bug in the RAM test that had to do with
    WATCHDOG statements being placed between a CMPA.L and the branch that
    tested the result of the compare. These clobbered the condition codes.
    What is particularly noteworthy is that in the process of writing this
    memo, I came across a note from Jed Margolin (dated 16-JUN-1988) addressing
    this issue. I assume I changed _some_ copy of the RAM test at that time,
    but obviously not the "master". Old code rises from the grave...

THE FIX (2):

	(OPINION ONLY) Abandon approach 2 and apply fix 1. I stress that
    this is my opinion, but I feel fairly strongly about this and am willing
    to debate at length issues of "correctness by construction" and the
    "partitioning" of software projects...

Subj:	HMI emulator


For those people who missed the HMI demo today (or couldn't see or hear 
anything because there was no room in my office) here is a brief recap
of our experiences with the HMI emulator running HMI SourceGate debugger
software :

HMI Emulator

Pros

- Fast Download speed

Because it downloads using the parallel printer port of the PC, program 
downloads are extremely fast.  The ZAX emulator and the HMI have roughly
equivalent download times, which is about twice as fast as an AMS with fast
download capabilities

- Source Level Trace

It is possible to view the trace in assembly, bus state or source forms and
to search the buffer for address, data and other conditions.  The trace can
be time tagged if desired.

- Performance Analyzer

Although a little tricky to set up, the performance anlyzer features of the 
HMI are powerful.  Code coverage analysis and performance timing information
are available.

- All Emulator features are Available from debugger

Because both the emulator and the debugger are from the same vendor, all 
emulator features (trace, hardware events etc.) are directly accessible from
the debugger.  Because XRAY is an emulator independent debugger, not all
emulator features are available from XRAY

Cons

- Flaky !!!

This unit does some very unpredictable things, and these things usually happen
at the worst possible time.  Software breakpoints do not always seem to work
and sometimes calling the trace buffer causes the debugger to crash. HMI is
bringing a new emulator to see if this will fix our problems but it seems more
like a problem with the debugger software.

- Poor User Interface

Not all functions are available from the command line.  To do some seemingly
simple things (such as setting a write break on a location), requires a great
deal of mucking around with various windows.  The macro facility is weak and
only works for command line commands.  There are a lot of flashy colors, but
the colors don't really mean anything and do not help the debugging process.
The general philosophy seems to be that flashy colors and windows make a good
user interface.  The debugger works with a mouse (which XRAY doesn't).  With
that exception, XRAY is definitely a better debugger than SourceGate.

- Slow Single Step

Single stepping is very slow.  Single stepping source lines is beyond sluggish
bordering on painful. No facility is provided to step around subroutine calls.

- Not all features available for Microtec Compiler yet

In Applied Research we are using the Microtec Greenhills compiler, which 
outputs in IEEE-695 format.  Structure viewing, and viewing of local and 
register variables is not supported with IEEE-695 format although HMI promises
support "real soon now ..."

In summary, the HMI system has good features but still has software problems
to work out before we should consider the purchase of any more units.  If 
anyone has any more questions or would like to play around with the system
please give me a call at x1773 or drop by the Applied Research lab.

Subj:	53 vs 50Hz


Jed;

	I have checked the vertical sync pulses with several scopes and they
all indicate that I am running the monitors at 50Hz not 53Hz.  Please check
the frame rate again.  If we are running at an incorrect rate maybe changing
to the proper rate will improve some of the problems I am having adjusting
the monitors (because they are rated at min of 50Hz).  I also need to know
the frame rate to determine clock time.

Subj:	Need Victim, uh... Volunteer


(I apologize to all you hardware guys who dropped hot soldering irons in
your laps in your haste to read this, but there is no "Programmers" list)

	I short while ago, I sent out a memo about common bugs. One
of them had to do with the 6502 and 68000 independantly deciding whether
or not they were in self-test. I have modified SACOIN.MAC to deal with
this problem by having a separate exception for self-test read of the
raw switches. I also added provision for table-driven assignment of
coin-counters to coin-mechs. I'd really like some brave volunteer to
use this version, so I can know if it _really_ works. It should "drop
right in" with no changes, if you can tolerate getting the incrementing
counters on your self-test screen. Then, by adding an exception that
uses E$TCSW (Test Coin SWitches) and using that, you will get the raw
switches for your self test and avoid bogus coins in your EEPROM when
you flip the test switch. The new code is five bytes shorter than the
old code, but the added table space for the exception cancels some of
that. In any case, it should pose no problem.

					Takers?

Subj:	Printouts


Please stop by the printer room and see if you have any listings under
your username.  The place was generally a mess so I tried to arrange
listings as best I could.  There are listings that have been buried
by people who apparently are too busy to arrange them neatly.
And there are listings that have been there for some time, perhaps 
because they were buried or because the owner forgot to pick it up.
Just for those who don't know, you can add a switch to the $ PRINT
statement to have the system notify you when your job has completed
printing:  /NOTIFY.  I know most of us are very busy and when we print
a job out sometimes we forget to pick it up.  Maybe the /NOTIFY switch
will help.  Also, maybe we could stop in at the printer room to check
if there is a printout that we forgot about (even our leader has MAIL
listings that date back to NOV!).

Subj:	How to find someone else who can't spell (either)

	A maxim stolen from Mr. Scott of the Starship Enterprise:

		There is no tool so useless that NOTHING
		can be found for it to be used to fix.

	I've found one of those tools...in fact several.

	Thanx to the efforts of Jeff Bell (who did the phone list part
and maintains it for everybody), and another party I suspect wants to
remain blameless {thanks, Mike}, I've glued a paper clip and a bobby pin
together.

	There is now a tool called NAME to search the company phone list
for people whose names you know but spellings that are, like, AlIEn??

	If you put "$ NAME :== $UTL$EXE:NAME" (no quotes) in your LOGIN.COM,
next time you $RESTART or log in, you can say things like $NAME STEVE
and get STAFF as a match.  I don't want to use real examples, because
those people think we spell our names wierd.  'Scuse me, weird.

	It does not supplant the FONE command most of you have, cuz it doesn't
know about digits (you can't say $NAME 1710 and get anything useful; but
$FONE 1710 will tell you that's my number).  It can be customized to use
other phone lists, if you have similar problems with private lists, but
people who computerize their phone list tend to computerize their own
solutions.  See me if customizing this sounds useful to you.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IT'S WORKING  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Question : When I set the area in data memory which contains the shadow 
locations for the ports (romaddrl, portwr, etc.) to 0 wait states the
program develops 'polygon burps'.  Any reason why the shadow locations
must be set to the same number of wait states as the ports ?

Subj:	Power-up woes


	Problem:  The BATMAN board would occasionally (and sometimes often)
power up without the VAD properly initialized, leading to Video RAM failures
which, by the nature of the test, would loop.  If these tests were bypassed 
by pushing buttons, the program would go on to hang (can't run without RAM)
and the watchdog would reinit everything, which would somehow clear the VAD 
problem.  

	Solution:  Modify the RAM tests so that if there is a failure, the
program goes back and reinits the VAD, just like after the watchdog timeout.
There is still somewhat of a scope loop for the RAM failure and the operator
can still bypass the test by pushing buttons.

	Observation:  If the VAD does not create VBLANK after power up, and
the processor gets lost before it can init the VAD into working, things hang
up.  Using an independent watchdog timer (ala 555) would eliminate having to
depend on the VAD to power up cleanly and permit the processor to reset the
VAD directly during init routines.

	OK.  I realize I did advertise a price of $1.00 before correcting 
myself, and I realize I trusted you to leave some money behind after taking
one of the World's Finest Chocolate bars, but it appears that there are
several of you out there who did not pay for your sweet snack.  If you 
have a guilty conscience and would like to make amends then call me at x1739.
Otherwise, I will make a contribution to Monarch Christian School.

	Many thanks to those of you who made this parents job of selling candy

Subj:	coin counters for BMX HEAT and STEEL TALONS


I am a little concerned about the ground return path for the coin 
counters on these games. The power comes from the audio board analog 
power, and the darlington switch is on the multisync board. The 
ground return goes through the serial interface (SCOM) signal ground wire.

Even though it is contra DFM, for these two games I think we should 
use 5 volt coin counters, and drive them from the logic +5v supply 
located conveniently nearby at the coin door.

							Pat.

  Jed_
 I'm doing a project for my applied elec. design class where we have to 
interface some fiber optics with a microcomputer using voltage conversion
to digital data between the computers I/O ports.  I was wondering if I
may model my basic A-D ckt after yours.  You wouldn't mind, would you?

 I'll tell you more about it when I come back from vacation next week.

Someone send this man a prize.  (I like the way he thinks!)
Then tell him to get all his friends back into the arcade.
Meanwhile, introduce him to a teenager.  (Sigh...)

  You state exactly Atari's position today, IMHO.  In these days of 
chop-socky/scrolling-blastemups, I always look forward to finding a new
Atari video, because I know they go the extra mile to bring innovation
into our otherwise dull lives... (eh! dramatic, corny pause)

  I could forgive them for "Pit Fighter", though I can't see why they
would sully their mounting reputation with this muddled chop-socky 
derivative. Easy bucks, I guess. Couldn't they at least have digitized the
characters more carefully, and animated them more smoothly? But I digress.

  Rattle through the list of recent Atari vids. Crystal Caverns, Marble
Madness, Packrat, Indy & Temple of Doom, Road Runner, Paperboy, 720, 
Night Stocker, Rolling Thunder, (?forget name)/Badlands, Xybots, Toobin, 
Gauntlet, APB, Klax, Hard/Race Drivin', S.T.U.N. Runner, Cyberball, Rampart.  
Each truly in a class by itself; I've seen other companies try to copy them 
and fail miserably. (Remember that horrid SNK ripoff of Rolling Thunder? 
That one lasted only two months.) Some were disappointing, most were
terrific, but each had at least one extremely well developed aspect.  
Some take an old idea and apply a new concept (Cyberball, Hard Drivin'),
but many are totally unique (Marble Madness, Paperboy, Toobin, Klax, etc.)

  Let the other companies continue to spit out the ninjadrek shootanythings,
but the only vids that get my quarters come from Atari.

Eric

One last thing.  I hope this 'digitized people' thing passes quickly; 
Williams' new football game looks sloppy, with all those blitting images.

I said it was OK to place the Road Riot Game in the Central Conf. Room
for a week or so.  Meetings can happen around it. When no meetings are
in progress, it's OK to be in there playing the game.  We needed a 
spot to put it where people could play it before field test without
impacting the noise level in workplaces. The game room is full so
the Central Conf. Room seemed like the next best choice. Sorry for
any inconvenience.

Subj:	ACME video -- Tuesday 3/26 12:30 SHARP Central Conf. Room


I got 15 to 20 minutes of video with my "Spycam" at the ACME 
show last week. Some of the highlights are:

	Sonic Blast Man -- Taito -- Punching bag for input

	Time Traveler -- Sega -- They called it a halogram, but 
		it is a laser disc game that has a mirror that 
		makes the image appear in space.

	Simpsons Video -- Konami -- Great graphics (just like 
		the cartoon) but repetitive, old gameplay

If you want to stay a couple minutes longer, you can see the 
new Excalibur Hotel.

Subj:	Mini-brainstorm for Navy Symposium


	Atari has been invited to participate in a Navy symposisium
called the "Skill Enhancement Project."  What they are really talking
about is applying gaming techniques and interactive game technology
to training someone in basic electronics (the selected example is
"how to debug a three stage audio amplifier").  I just recieved a
package with all the background information and some questions they
will be discussing NEXT WEEK at this symposium.
	Also in this package, I discovered that I am to give a
15 minute presentation and written comments on the topics they will
be discussing.  Being rather short on time, I need your help!  I would like
to have a mini-brainstorming on what kind of games could be created for
their purpose or could enhance their training techniques tomorrow during
lunch (around 11:30 to 12:30).  Pizza and soft drinks will be provided.  I
would like to keep this to around 4-6 interested people so if you are
"interested people", please respond to this VAXmail.  I will let you know the
details and if this is a "go" by the end of today.
	If you have any question, or would like to see the information
package the Navy sent me, just come by my office.  I will have a copy of
the package posted on the cubicle outside my door.

Subj:	ATARI AWARDS


We just returned from the ACME show where Atari Games received "Manufacturer
of the Year", awarded by AAMA (our amusement machine association).  This
award was voted on by distributors and based on:

- Production, Quality, Reliability
- Marketing and Promotions
- Customer Support

It is the only award extended to any manufacturer and this represents the
second year in a row that Atari Games has received this top honor...they
have only been doing it for two years!  

Also, during the ACME show, our Pit-Fighter game received a Platinum award
for sales achievement, given by the AAMA.  Very few games ever reach this
level of achievement so again, it is quite a feat.  

And lastly, we also received this week, a very impressive trophy for 
STUNRUNNER, given by Game Player's magazine, as it was voted "best arcade
game of 1990"!  

Congratulations to all employees for making Atari Game's achievements so
highly recognized in our industry.  These awards, along with many others
received in past years, will be displayed in a newly-designed case that
will be mounted in our re-decorated lobby.  

p.s.  Not only did we receive some great awards at the show, but we 
also had success in selling our newest games!

                                                              Mary

Subj:	Atari Games v. Nintendo


MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

"Late this afternoon Judge Fern Smith of the Federal Court in
San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction to Nintendo which
alleged a violation of its copyright by Tengen and Atari.  The
Court order provides a very one-sided and prejudiced opinion and
determined as if we are unlawful copiers of Nintendo's NES console
chips, which is definitely far from the truth.  However, the 
decision was given, and the damage caused by the decision and its
impact will not be small.  As a matter of course, Tengen and Atari
are prepared to appeal after having meetings with our attorneys.

"Ladies and Gentlemen, it looks as though we lost a major battle.
Let us accept the fact and maintain to be calm and strong.  We
will continue to be in business, so sit tight and wait for
further comment to be announced by me shortly.  Thank you for 
your cooperation, understanding and further support."

Hide Nakajima, President

Subj:	Atari Games v. Nintendo


MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

As I mentioned yesterday, the Federal Court in San Francisco issued
a written decision in favor of Nintendo in the ongoing lawsuit. 
That order granted Nintendo's motion for a preliminary injunction
prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling our Nintendo Entertain-
ment System game cartridges.

In its written order, the Court found that our cartridges infringed
Nintendo's copyright on the computer program contained in Nintendo's
lockout chips contained in the NES base units.  The Court found that
Tengen cartridges and the means by which they were developed went
too far in incorporating similarities to Nintendo's program which
we believe are necessary for Tengen cartridges to be compatible
with the NES.  We believe that the Court's opinion makes it 
impractical, if not impossible, to produce cartridges compatible
with the NES.

Given the proliferation of compatible computer products throughout
the electronics industry, we find the Court's opinion to be a 
highly unusual result and an incorrect interpretation of the
copyright laws which we intend to appeal.  We expect to be taking
the first step to pursue an appeal early next week.

Hide Nakajima, President

SAY HEY BASEBALL FANS

	IT'S SUNNY AND IT'S A BEAUTIFULL DAY FOR
A BALL GAME. THE ATARI SURVIORS ARE BACK AND HAVE 
MOVED UP TO THE "DOUBLE D" DIVISION AT TWIN CREEKS
SPORT COMPLEX. 

	As former owner you can imagine my chagrin
at having had to sell this team last year just as
they were begining to blossom into their coveted 
"DOUBLE D" status. My organization back then knew they 
were destined for greatness but unfortunately could not
afford the new uniforms they wanted and therefore had 
to let them go. But this doesn't mean I won't be there 
to show my support of this fine group of atheletes who 
have been training for months.

		    DON'T YOU MISS OUT. 
	The New ATARI SURVIVORS vs. The Psycos 
			Field # 9
	
	TODAY, TUESDAY the 2nd of APRIL at 5:30 pm
			  at 
	Twin Creeks Sports complex just of Carribean
              Drive which is just off 237. 

		    NO BETTING PLEASE!

Subj:	security


  Today Dennis showed me how to program the TMS320 chip.  But it seems
we " THE ROADRIOT TEAM " were not clear about what setting the R-bit
does to the chip with respect to re-using/re-programming it.

  Thankyou JED & ERIC for pointing out the R-bit to me, and explaining
how it works. 

  Knowing that the security bit is set on these chips makes the 
piracy that much slower, and we can always ERASE THE CHIPS TO RE-BURN
them if we need to.

 I'll personally make sure that none of the 320 chips will leave 
this building without the lock on them.

out he has pneumonia, and as soon as they
have that cleared up (which will probably
take 7-10 days) he will have back surgery.
He is in the El Camino Hospital, room 531B.
His wife said they are trying to limit visitors
because they have him heavily sedated.

We'll keep you posted as soon as we hear anything.

Personal item:
	Help Needed : Videotape Damage Control

	Ouch! I have recorded over a big section of
a borrowed tape and am HOPING somebody may also
have taped it so that I can repair the damage.

   What it is: Bradshaw on The Family, episodes 1-5
        This is a self-help lecture series.

These were broadcast a number of times on KQED and this
tape was made during one pledge day -- five one-hour
episodes in a row. I taped over episodes 2, 3 and half
of 4.

May I borrow your copy to restore this? Any help/suggestions? 
Please help me look less like a dope to my friend's friend...

Subj:	Atari Games on Cable TV


Financial News Network (FNN on cable ch. 18) is featuring Atari Games 
in a new segment called "Computing:  Today and Tomorrow".  We will be
shown in a 9-minute segment for their Corporate Profile of the Week.

AIR TIME:  SATURDAY, APRIL 6,  7:00 AM Eastern standard time 

YES THAT MEANS SET YOUR VCR'S FOR 4:00 AM TOMORROW MORNING IF YOU
WANT TO SEE IT OUT HERE.  

For those of you who are interested, I will be circulating extra copies
in manufacturing, engineering, and administration.  I am sure these 
departments will have the tape available for showing next week.  

The segment shows some great footage of the manufacturing process and 
demonstrates the development of both Batman and Race Drivin' to some
extent.  Of course, there are also a few key executive interviews  also.

Thanks again to all of you who participated in the filming last week.

	I guess my probation is over.  I'm no longer in the no-man's-land of
the Berlin Hall (we really DO have to rename that place).  I've finally been
admitted to the ranks of the Administration.

	My new office is back-to-back with my old office.  Some will remember
it as Bob Frye's old office.  It, like the office I just left, is adjacent to
the Executive Conference room, but it's nearer to Sandi Brown's office and
Bob Frye's (my new neighbors).

	Bob pointed out that since I had to keep my door closed when I was in
the hallway, the fact that I'm no longer a tenant wouldn't be particularly
obvious.  In my new home, the door will usually be open.

	The old office?  It goes to storage (nobody else wants it, either).

	Stop on by!  Marvel at the amount of junk I can squeeze in!  Ogle the
earthquake testing equipment!  Tell me that you AREN'T moving anything, and
that everything WORKS!  Volunteer to help me move the next time!

Subj:	GENERIC AUDIO SELF TEST PROCEDURES

The AUDIO Group recommends that before a game is released for manufacturing 
the majority of audio calls are removed from the AUDIO portion of the SELF-TEST. 
The reason is that we DO NOT want to give our competition the advantage of
having intimate knowledge of our operations.
The recommended audio calls to be included for RELEASE are:

* Any audio processor related tests (like YAMAHA (usually S_YTST) and
  ADPCM (usually S_ADTEST)).
* SCOM or other communications test (NOTE that this is usually an internal test
  and not a specific call available to the user.  It is usually reported to the
  user at the beginning of the AUDIO SELF-TEST)
* The ability to RESET or STOP all sounds
* Reporting of diagnostic results (NOTE that this is also usually internal and
  not a specific call.  It's usually reported at AUDIO SELF-TEST startup)
* DAC for VOLUME calls (if appropriate)
* Generally, any calls that would help test the game on the line

I fully agree and did so with Pit.  You're mail made it sound more difficult
than it really is.  Since all the 'required' sounds are at the beginning of
the list, all one really has to do is make an arbitrary upper limit cut-off
after, say, the first 30 sounds.  You might want to point this out to folks
so as not to scare them away...

Subj:	Thoughts on the recent "tragedies"


Now as the Persian Gulf crisis seems to be winding down, there is clearly
much more to do before peace can truly become a reality.

Life is full of contradictions.  Society is full of injustice.  Despite all 
appearances to the contrary, human society is dominated by the animalistic 
principle that the strong devour the weak.  War is the symbol of that 
principle.  Even in ordinary society, the strong despise and look down upon 
the weak and torment them.  And the weak cling to the strong as they torment 
those who are still weaker.  Perhaps it is this chain of evil, if you will, 
that has been the unchanging karma of the human race since ancient times.

Even those who are supposed to protect and save those in trouble act in the 
opposite fashion, using their position to arrogantly exploit and sacrifice 
others in the interest of their own egoistic self-protection.

Politicians tend to be haughty and pompous toward the general populace.  And 
they may resort to trickery in seeking to secure fame and fortune for 
themselves.  Lawyers are in the best position to protect persons who are 
suffering and in trouble.  But in spite of this, there are many lawyers who 
take the opposite stance of lording it over their clients. (How well do I 
know this to be the fact!)  Clergymen may use the power of religion to 
elevate themselves and look arrogantly down on their believers, viewing them 
as a means to their own personal ends.  

There are similar examples in other fields as well where the appearance and 
the heart are mutually contradictory; in a word, this is falsehood.

What can be done about these contradictions and deceptions?  Is there 
nothing for us to do but give up in the face of the structure of evil?  It 
is true that since changes in the system alone will never in themselves 
succeed in altering human nature, the same tragedies will simply go on 
repeating athemselves?

Your response is welcome and much appreciated.

Subj:	New CELPROCESS V1.67


***** ATTENTION ***** ATTENTION ***** ATTENTION *****

There is now a new version of CELPROCESS (v1.67).  This new version
supports the ability to convert a close reduced cell in a .IMG/.ASM
file pair to a cell in a .RAD file. You can now examine the results
of the close reduction without having to burn ROMS!!

To invoke this new option, create a .OPT file with the following:

/IMG2RAD = filename, label, [colfile]

	where FILENAME = the non-suffix .IMG/.ASM file pair name
			 (i.e. ALPHA for ALPHA.ASM and ALPHA.IMG)

	      LABEL    = a celprocess label in the .ASM file
			 (i.e. MAP000)

	      COLFILE  = an OPTIONAL .COL file that contains the
                         palettes you wish to apply to the .RAD
			 output. (i.e. ALPHA.COL) If no COLFILE
			 is provided, the RAD default palettes
			 are used.

For further explanation of this new feature, see Andrew Burgess.

Thanks in advance,

Senate 266 introduced by Mr. Biden (for himself and Mr. DeConcini)
contains the following section:

SEC. 2201. COOPERATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications
services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall
ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain
text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately
authorized by law.

[ Selected excerpts from the followup post by the same author:]

The referenced language requires that manufacturers build trap-doors
into all cryptographic equipment and that providers of cconfidential
channels reserve to themselves, their agents, and assigns the ability to
read all traffic.  

[Does anybody] believe that it is possible for
manufacturers of crypto gear to include such a mechanism and also to reserve
its use to those "appropriately authorized by law" to employ it?

[Does anybody]  believe that providers of electronic
communications services can reserve to themselves the ability to read all the
traffic and still keep the traffic "confidential" in any meaningful sense?

[Would _YOU_] buy crypto gear or confidential services from vendors who were
subject to such a law?

[...] An earlier Senate went to great pains to assure itself that there were
no trapdoors in the DES. Mr. Biden and Mr. DeConcini want to mandate them.

[...]

Any assertion that all use of any such trap-doors would be only
"when appropriately authorized by law" is absurd on its face.  It is not
humanly possible to construct a mechanism that could meet that
requirement;  any such mechanism would be subject to abuse.

Subj:	Atari Games vs. Nintendo


To:	Employees of Atari Games and Tengen            4/12/91
From:   Hide Nakajima, President

On March 27 the District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing
Tengen from the further manufacturing or marketing of its NES-compatible game 
cartridges. As a result of the Court's order, many newspaper and industry 
press articles appeared that portrayed our company in a negative lights. We 
strongly disagree with the Court's position and steps were taken immediately 
to appeal the decision.

One of the legal procedures taken was to ask the Court to stay its order 
pending an outcome of the litigation.  We believe that the denial of a stay 
would result in grave consequences for Tengen.  Yesterday, the Court asked 
for additional information in considering Tengen's request for a stay.  We 
anticipate the Court's answer shortly, but for now, Tengen and retailers can 
continue their NES-compatible game cartridge business.

However, it was necessary to have a staff reduction at Tengen because of the 
considerable commercial damage done by the preliminary injunction order.  
This was a painful process for all involved and I deeply appreciate the 
loyalty and efforts of all affected employees.

At present, the Company's attorneys continue to vigorously pursue our 
antitrust and other claims against Nintendo as well as continue the appeal 
of the preliminary injunction.  We strongly believe our position is as 
correct today as when the lawsuit began.  Thank you for your continued 
efforts for, and belief in our Company.  I am pround of you.

Regards,

Hide Nakajima

P.S. Further information will be provided regarding the status of the 
     lawsuit as it becomes available.

Subj:	Compact Flourescents


Yeah, I know you've heard it all before, but this time it's really
true:  YOU CAN SAVE BIG MONEY AND HELP THE ENVIRONMENT TOO!!
Here's the deal:  PG+E and OSH have teamed up to offer a $7.00 rebate
on the OSRAM electronically ballasted compact flourescent bulbs.  

I know what you're thinking; flourescents buzz, they flicker, don't 
come on fast, and the color of light makes you look bad.  Suprise!
these have electronic ballasts so they don't buzz or flicker and come
on almost instantly.  Also, the chemists who formulate the phosphors have
finally realized that people don't like to look like corpses and have
come up with a new compound that has a reasonable color.  I find it
almost indistinguishable from an incandescent lamp in a lamp that has a
shade.

Now for the savings:
			75 Watt incandescent	20 Watt compact flourescent

Bulb Life:		1000hr * 10 = 10,000hr		10,000 hr
KWHR Used:		.075 * 10000 = 750		.020 * 10000=200
Elec. cost @$.10/KWHR	750 * $.10 = $75.00		200 * $.10 = $20.00
Bulb Cost:		 $.75 * 10 = $ 7.50	    	$14.99-$7.00=$ 7.99
Total Cost:			     $82.50			     $27.99

Thus, over the life of the compact flourescent (~3 years @ 10hrs/day)
you save a total of 550 kwhr of electricity and $55.51 in cold cash.
Your savings may vary due to different electric rates.

The environmental benefits are also impressive: At .09 gallon of fuel oil
and 1.5 lbs of carbon dioxide per kwhr (33% efficiency in a fuel oil
electric plant) you will have saved roughly a 55 gallon drum worth of oil
and prevented more that 3/4 of a ton of carbon dioxide from getting into
the atmosphere.

Here's the only downside:  It can be a hassle to get these lamps to work
in table lamps since the OSRAM bulb is longer and wider at the base than
an incandescent bulb.  You may have to modify the hoop that holds up
the shade, or buy an extender to move the bulb higher in the fixture.

The OSRAM lamps have such a high surface brightness that they may be
uncomfortable to look at in bare bulb applications.  OSRAM offers a 15 watt
bulb with a built in reflector for $18.99-$7.00 that can be used under these
conditions or to replace 75 watt spotlights.  Panasonic also has a line
of compact florescents that have built in globes to address this problem.
There are two types: an older, non electronic type that uses a small amount
of radioactivity to start the lamp, and a newer electronic type that 
works like the OSRAM.  Unfortunately, the new ones are not available
at OSH yet, and the older ones are not covered by the rebate.  PG+E
offered the new ones by mail order in last month's newsletter included
with your bill for $7.50 for 20 watt (75 watt equiv) and $9.50 for 27
watt (100 watt equiv).  I sent away for 3 of each but haven't got them
yet.

If you want to see these bulbs, I have two in my office this
week, and I'd be happy to demonstrate them for you.  Just remember,
for each one of these you can find a place for in your home you will
save 55 bucks and enough foreign (or domestic) oil to drive your car
more than 1000 miles over the life of the lamp.  Check them out!
(The PG+E rebate is good through the end of April).

Subj:	Give yourself some moments to ponder on the fundamentals of life


First of all, I thank you very much for those who took time to respond to
my mail sent last week, namely, Mike Albaugh, John Ray, Bonnie Bike, Bridget 
Erdman and Gary Stark.  I thank you to Jerry Lichac for your this morning's
response.

Here is an another familiar topic on which I would like to address to ponder
...

The recent beating of an unarmed citizen by a group of Los Angeles police 
officers has shocked a city and a nation.  

I've been taught that the three impurities of our age are greed, anger and igno-
rance.  Greed causes disharmony between people and the environment.  Anger 
causes disharmony between people, and ignorance or complaining causes dis-
harmony within our very body or illness.  The sight of uncontrolled anger
shown on the video taped beating of Rodney King was a horrifying example of the
world of Anger.  And this comes just after humankind's greatest expression of 
Anger, the war in the Middle Eas!  People in the world of Anger may hate
others simply because they are of different race or religion.

One of the books I recently read states "...he who is in the world of Anger,
motivatd by the warped desire to be better than everyone, is forever 
belittling others and exalting himself.  He is like a hawk sweeping the sky 
in search of prey.  He may outwardly display benevolence, righteousness, pro-
priety wisdom and good faith, and even possess a rudimentary moral sense, 
but his heart remains in the world of Anger."

Controlling our negative impulses is the only way we can survive in a civilized
sociery.  My memtor in life explained that one of the major functions of
religion is to foster self-control and self-restraint.  He said that "the 
building of lasting peace depends on how many people capable of self-straint
can be fostered through religious guidance.  If a religion is worthy of the
name, and if it is one that can respond to the needs of contemporary times,
it should be able to nurture in its followers the spiritual base for becoming
good citizens of the world."

Society is a living thing.  It is a process, a series of changes. We live in a 
world where national borders are bridged by communication and travel in ways 
never before dreamed of.  we need to work on building bridges to link people in
humanistic ways.  For us to create lasting harmony, we must become the broad-
minded, self-controlled and intelligent individuals needed for the new century.
We must become bigger than our problems! 

Thank you for allowing me to express my passion for bettering our world. 
April 26 is my last day at Atari.  If nothing else, at least, I am so very
delighted to hear from those people who responded to my passionate
appeal (!?) and I truly believe they are among many who teach or will teach 
their children to be the leaders of our nation and of the 21st century. 
Thank you! 

Wish you all the best, good health and a long happy life!  
Remember that the happiness is our Right, not a privilege!

                                                                  Kiyoko

Subj:	ADSP-2101 Forecast


Please call Tom McKee of Analog Devices at (408) 559-2037. He needs
to get a forecast for our use of ADSP-2101s. (He is filling in for
Margot while she has her baby, and is her boss.)

This is what makes it complicated:

The ADSP-2101KP-50, Atari pn 137662-050, (IC,CMOS,DSP,50MHz,68P,PLCC)
has design problems that they do not plan to fix until the end of the
summer. In the meantime they will select-out parts that will work in my
circuit. The label on these special parts will be "AD 90461-1". I am
getting a new Atari part number for it and will use this new number
on my parts list.

This part is used on the DS III board which I am still checking out.
By all appearances, we will use this board (which replaces ADSP II) on:
	
	Steel Talons
	BMX
	Street Driver

DS III also uses an ADSP-2105KP-40 which is not affected by their poor
design. However, this part is used on the DS III board to do Sounds
and the EDs will probably use Brad's Sound Board on Steel Talons.

The Eds' game did very well on field test and will probably be a big hit
so we will need a lot of 2101s.

If and when they get the regular IC to work we will switch over to that
part.

Are you in the Dog House, according to your spouse?
Maybe you've got a Wild Hair and want to show a loved one how much you care!
Perhaps that special someone deserves flowers for something they've done.
     But hey, who needs a reason to give flowers?

We've got what you want. Reasonably priced, too.

2 DOZEN LARGE ROSES for only $7.50
Colors:  Red, yellow, Pink, Orange, Salmon, Pale Peach, White, and
         Spring Surprise (pink with white trim)

For a small fee, you may wish to add...
                                         Baby's Breath   $4.00
                                         Fern Greens     $2.50

Remember, flowers are not only for those of you with significant others
and are in no way a form of request for commitment.  So don't be shy,
buy, buy, buy!

Have A Nice Day!

Tina & Lorene

Subj:	WARNING!!!!


Our friends, the civil servants that park near here in those official
black and white cars, have found a new hiding place in the fields near
McCarthy and 237.  One was spotted in the brush next to the new ramp
for 237 West off of McCarthy.  You know, that signal that has nobody to
really signal to because there is currently no real cross-traffic (except
from the field)...well it turns red anyway sometimes and you are supposed
to stop even when there are no other cars around.

Drive defensively!

                                                --Linda

	I am trying to determine what I should buy to have two pot joysticks
(4 inputs) connected to an IBM PC.  What joysticks work well?  Which ones to
avoid?  The joysticks can be simple.  One needs to return to center and the 
other need not.

	What interface PCB should I buy to read the two joysticks?  Is there
any software interface beyond reading a latch?

Subj:	System down time


Some more equipment trickled in this week. 

I'll be changing the rest of the firmware in the terminal servers
on Sunday. Judging how long it took last time, I expect it to take
about 4 hours. So the terminals connected to the servers will be
unusable from about 10am to 2pm this sunday (4/21/91).

I'll also be adding some additional disks to KIM and replacing the
disk controllers on MIKE. This should take about 4 hours (some of
it may overlap the terminal server firmware replacment time).

One should expect the systems to be unusable on sunday from about
10am to 6pm.

Please welcome Victor Marcieca to Coin-op. Victor prefers to pronounce his last
name as Mer-CHEE-ah.  Victor comes to us from Tengen where he was a Game
Counselor.  His primary role  in Coin-op is playtester with some game analysis
and design as a secondary role for all Engineering groups. Victor will also be
available to assist with field test games in terms of moving, stat taking, and
collections. He cannot drive the truck. Victor will report to me. 
Initial assignments include final playtest on Marble Man and Road Riot - you
know, logging 40 hours of bug-free play before the program memory masters are
released.  He is also assigned to work with the SPACE team in a game analysis
role and possibly some game design as circumstances permit. 
Victor has quite a bit of experience with Coin-op games and I invite all the
game teams to solicit his opinions. I think you will find him enthusiatic and
insightful.  
His office is the cubicle between Peter Lipson and The EPROM programmer.

Subj:	Network Game Vote


In an effort to expand the boundaries of where we can sell our game expertise,
we are preparing a business plan for an Atari on-line Network.

You can help!

As part of the business plan, we will be proposing an initial offering of two
different games on the network.  We obviously would like to start off strong,
and so would like to initially pick the two games which will best show off
our system and generate the most player interest.

So, please look over the very brief description of the capabilites of this
proposed network and the 10 game ideas which we have come up with so far
and pick which two you think would be best to start up with.  If you have
any additional game ideas you think would be good for this playing
environment, by all means please forward them to this address and we will
add them to our list of candidates!

The file which contains the game ideas is called netgames.doc in [RUSTY].
Please treat this file as company confidential and do not make copies of
it or broadcast its contents.

Please try and cast your vote on or before Thursday 4/25.

	Thanks,
	Rusty

P.S.  If you would like more information on the proposed capabilites of
our network, please feel free to see me for the additional info.

Subj:	7th grade math


	My 12 year old daughter brought home the following math homework
problems last night.  Now everyone knows the standard joke about parents
being unable to help their children with the new math.  Now I consider 
myself intelligent and considering I have a Masters degree in Math from
Stanford, I figured I could handle this.

	Find the next three numbers in the sequences:

	1. -16, -6, +4, +1
	1. +16 -6 +4 +14 (just add +10 each time)
	2. +10 +6 +2 -2 (just add -4 each time)
	3. -5 +10 -20 +40 (-80 160 -320 ok so it's a little harder)
	4. -1 +1 -2 +6 (???????)

	I could provide a dozen different answers for a dozen different
reasons.  Could someone give me a simple answer an ordinary 7th grader
could understand?  Maybe these people write tax laws and texts for the
IRS during the summer months.  I wonder what the advanced 7th graders
get for problems?

Subj:	Featured feature


	We are running out of numbers!!

	In late 1991, Pacific Bell will begin to require (408) prefixes
to dial a 1 before any area code.  This is already the case in the (415)
area code.  The bottom line is that YOU MUST dial 9(to get out)-1-area-number
after this starts, and 9(to get out)-number for 408 numbers on our phone
system.

	This dialing is available and will work now, if you choose to switch
gradually, or like me, live in (415) and have to do it anyways.  After the
change, you'll get the recordings of "have to dial a one" and "a one is not
necessary" at the appropriate times.  Contrary to popular opinion, they
DO need to issue the messages, because a few months after they start, they
can no longer tell (nor insert it for you).

	For the curious and terminally bored, the reason for the change is
as follows.  Area codes are supposed to always have a 1 or 0 as the middle
digit, and exchanges (the group of three that start a seven-digit number)
are supposed to NOT have a 0 or 1 as the middle digit.  They have begun to
run out of exchanges, and are going to have to create exchanges that are
against the rules.  So, since there may be a 903 prefix and a 903 area code,
when you dial a number starting with 903, they'll assume you want the newly
created phone numbers for the apartments going up across town.  Since this
would make area (903) inaccessable (and others as each prefix was set up)
the one in the front tells the equipment that this is an out-of-area call.

	To sum it up:  One-plus dialing is coming to 408; you can start
to use it at any time, but by Christmas it will be required.  From company
phones, dial 9, 1, areacode, number, or 9, number-within-408.

Will the power input and motor output connectors be the same
and generally in the same position?

Hello and how do you do?

	The CONNECT function is how you talk to a party you have on HOLD.

	There are several ways for someone to wind up on HOLD.  That's 
complicated.  How to talk to them?  That's simple.

	You have someone on HOLD if you get a higher pitched dial tone than
you're used to.  You have had someone placed on HOLD if you hear a soft beep
during a conversation.  And you can put someone on HOLD.

	How to UNHOLD?  That's CONNECT.  If you have a button marked CONNECT
or CNCT, push it.  If you don't, do a FLASH if appropriate, and dial * 1.

	That's FLASH, STAR, ONE.  Hurry, your parties are standing by!

	What is this FLASH nonsense, anyways?

	It's simple.  When you push the buttons, you simply make noise.
IF the phone system is expecting you to make dialing noises, it dials.  IF
it is expecting access codes, it accesses.  IF the noises you make (like
talking, singing, playing the flute, or playing the keypad) get sent to
"the other end", it sends.

	Once you are connected to another phone, the ONLY thing you can
do is hang up.  BUT, if you hang up and quickly pick up again, phone systems
tend to not disconnect (as you may have experienced at home).  This is called
FLASHing the switchhook (the hook that holds the handset and works the switch).

	You FLASH when you need to get the attention of the phone system.  You
can tell if you have its attention, because it generates a tone to let you know.
When you want to transfer a call, you are already connected by definition.  You
need to tell the phone system what to do.  You FLASH to get a dial tone.
FLASH is unneccesary (but doesn't hurt) if you already have a dial tone.

	Now, some people find it difficult to get the timing down, and either
flash for too short or too long a time.  Too short simply doesn't work, but
too long can be disastrous!

	Some Ergonomic Engineer at Rolm realized this and provided a FLASH
button on the phones we use (most of us, anyways).  If you have a flash
button, DON'T USE THE SWITCHOOK.  It has electronics behind it to stay hung
up for long enough to make sure.  It WILL hang up the phone.  Just push the
flash button.  On phones that don't have the button (like wall phones) simply
hang up very breifly--usually pushing the hangup button with your finger is
better than actually hanging up the phone.

	Of course, there are exceptions, and several, at that.  The best general
rule I can give for multibutton phones is:  If it has a flash button, use it.
If it doesn't, it might be an ETS (one of the electronic types we have).  ETSs
never need a flash, and in fact, can't.  If you have feature buttons, they 
should not need to be preceded by a flash (feature buttons are those that
aren't "line" buttons and also arent 0-9, #, or *--the dial pad).  If you
find that you make noise instead of doing what you want, do a FLASH.

	The bottom line is:  FLASH is to get the attention of the phone system.
Performing a FLASH gets you some kind of dial tone, and is needed before any
of the feature codes (watch this space for more details).  ETS sets (only!)
don't have and can't use the FLASH function.  All other sets need a FLASH;
if you have a button marked FLASH, use it; if you don't, momentarily push
the switchook.  Dedicated buttons (buttons marked TRANSFER, for example)
won't need a FLASH beforehand if they are properly programmed; if they aren't
properly programmed, let me know, & I'll fix it.

Re: Special Report
Dt: 25 April 1991


In order for BMX to be released, the following must be done:


Memory Expansion Board
----------------------
 There is a PC error that must be fixed. 

 PC must generate a useable parts list.


MultiSync
---------
 If BMX is to use the DSPLINK Board, the MultiSync board must be changed.

 The plan is to change the SCOM Interrupt and replace Slapstic with
 Pat's  GAL6001. If these are the only changes, the board will remain
 compatible with Steel Talons and Street Driver. It could also be used
 in Panorama if a GAL6001 can be programmed to behave like a Slapstic 115.

 A new version will have to be created (MultiSync II), documented, and 
 checked. 


ADSP II
-------
 If BMX is to use the ADSP II Board, a new version must be documented.

 If BMX is to use a partially loaded DS III Board, we have to:
    1. Correct the existing Rev 1 Board;
    2. Create an appropriate parts list;
    3. Build and test two DS II RAM Boards so Bonnie can continue development.
        (Both her ADSP II Boards have RAM boards which can only be used with
         ADSP II Boards.)


DSPLINK
-------
  If Bonnie is planning on using it, it has to be released. I don't know if 
  PC has a useable parts list yet.


Motor and Fan Amp
-----------------
The board will have to work.

Subj:	Vending machines


Did you notice that the prices in the vending machines just went up another
5 cents?  What a rip off, that's about 25% inflation per year.  Soda used to
be 50 cents is now 65, and candy is now 55 cents for smaller amounts.  Who's
in charge of these bandits?  What's to be done?

How about self-serve sodas in the Engineering refrigerator?  We keep a stock of
various flavors in the cooler, available to anyone for a reasonable price (about
35 cents/can) on a honor system.  If the sodas get paid for, the practice
continues.  If they get ripped off, the practice stops.  If you don't have the 
cash, an IOU is OK too.

We could fund this initially from the donut fund, or interested parties could put
up some cash.  

How about sodaheads, any interest?

Subj:	Steel Talons - APU?

The ADC on Multi-sync needs a regulated 15VDC.  The plan is to put the
regulator circuit on the "Rump-thump" driver PCB for production.  Moncrief
agrees that it's a good place to put it - he needs to check with Jed to
confirm the technical details.  I am assuming Rick will get the circuit
to Mccarthy so it will be included in the Rump-thump.  Pat, please set a
deadline for getting the info.  Pat/Rick can get the wiring info to Stevie.
I want to do an FCC test on the game in Mid to late June 1991, so I will
need Rump-thump PCB's W/15VDC regulation by 6/15/91 at the latest.

IN THE MEANTIME, Steel talons field test games will use an APU PCB since it
has the needed 15VDC regulator.

	A thing to keep in mind:  In September, the East Bay (Fremont North)
will change from area code 415 to 510.  415 will continue to serve the
peninsula.  For the initial part of the change, either area code will work;
then it will kindly tell you, then it will become "permanent" and start
misrouting calls (sending Oakland calls to SF, for example).

	You should be able to tell from the location of the party you're calling
whether or not their area code has changed.

I wanted to ask you about DTST1 which is where my program has been hanging in 
a loop.  I downloaded your symbols for selftest from [margolin.bonnie].
It goes there when there is no watchdog clear.  I'm not sure that that means.

You'll have to excuse me..I just got back from vacation and it seems like I've
caught a case of Reaganism...I couldn't remember my phone number. It is 3923
not 4923. The color of the vehicle is a candy red exterior and a tan interior.
The driver and front passenger seats have sheepskin covers. It also has a fold
down rear seat, a full-size spare tire, and plenty of cargo area.

Subj:	Stuff in UTL$PPS


Greetings,

In an effort to identify obsolete utilites in utl$pps, I have moved a bunch
of files from 

	ee$userdisk:[pps.utilities] 	(aka utl$pps:) 
to
	ee$userdisk:[pps.utilities.obsolete]

If your favorite utility has suddenly vanished, let me know and I'll put it
back. If I'm not around and you need it right away, just define a symbol to 
point to the new location for the utility and use that until I can put the
utility back for you.  For example, if XXX.EXE has vanished, the line below
will let you run SYMXXX instead of XXX to run the utility.

	$ symxxx :== $ ee$userdisk:[pps.utilites.obsolete]xxx.exe

				Thanks,

Why don't you read the volume control pot with the A/D? The advantage
is that the operator will be able to set the volume during the game
(which is where the volume should be set) and you will be spared the
abuse from operators outraged because they have just spent $8K on a
game with a stupid volume control.

Subj:	Meeting of employees of Atari Games and Tengen


Message from the President:

I would like to have a meeting with all the employees from 11:00 to
11:30 a.m. on May 8 in the cafeteria to discuss the general status
of the company's current business and legal situation.  With me in
attendance will be Mr. Marty Payson, Vice Chairman of Time Warner
who is also a member of the Atari Board of Directors.  He also will
say a few words at the meeting.

Please adjust your schedules to be in the cafeteria so that the
meeting can start promptly at 11:00 a.m.  The cafeteria will 
resume serving after 11:30 a.m.

From 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. I am planning, tentatively, to have a
tour of Atari and Tengen with Mr. Payson.  However, we may or
may not have enough time to do this depending upon the agenda
of that day.

Subj:	System down time


Gawd seems to be having a serious problem. I have changed everything including
the rubber feet on the cabinet and the problem persists. The next option
requires a reconfiguration of the disk subsystems. Since Gawd remains highly
unreliable at present, I am choosing to do this reconfig today. I expect this
procedure to take around 10 hours and I'm going to begin at 6pm.

What's this mean to you? It means Gawd, Kim, EEx$USERDISK and TE$USERDISK will
be unavailable for use from 6pm today (5/6/91) until tomorrow morning.

I don't know what is causing the problem, so this might not fix it. Since
the system has had this problem off and on for about 2 years AND it shows
up anywhere from every couple hours to once in 3 or 4 months, it may take
awhile even to find out whether its fixed or not.

Sorry if this presents a problem to anyone.

	A thing to keep in mind:  In September, the East Bay (Fremont North)
will change from area code 415 to 510.  415 will continue to serve the
peninsula.  For the initial part of the change, either area code will work;
then it will kindly tell you, then it will become "permanent" and start
misrouting calls (sending Oakland calls to SF, for example).

	Also, the Campbell/San Jose/Santa Clara/Saratoga White Pages,
dated March 1991, has a misprint that Pac Bell felt was worthy of correction.
I dunno what it is, but it must be a doozy.  If you have one of these phone
books (basically the San Jose white pages), pick up a corrected page in the
lobby.  Please, only take one if you need it.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Because we have not done it in a while, and because of a VIP 
tour tomorrow, we will be having a cleanup this afternoon from 
2:00 to 3:00 (or however long it takes).

Chris, Pat, and I will be available for advice on what to do 
with things you don't want. We will have carts you can put it 
on. You should try to make your labs look tidy -- the janitors 
will clean the floors tonight.

There are a lot of games in the common area and in the lab 
corridors that are either sold or to be sold. These games will 
be moved to the warehouse. If you have purchased a game but not 
taken it home, you can take it home by May 24. After that time, 
it will be sold (again) to someone who will take it home.

I will have drinks for those participating. Thanks for your help!

John

P.S. Techs should plan on 2:00-4:00.

.. this came in over USENET
>>>>>

Newsgroups: rec.games.video.arcade
Subject: New Game

   It's called "Brainstormer" and (of course) allows two player
interaction, but NOT the way you think---in alternating levels, the players
make the board for the other player _in real time_ or race through the board,
garnering more points for hard boards.

   The basic object is to race through an epeliptic's mind (a fluid, ever-
changing thing), jumping your thought cycle from thought track to thought
track (these tracks fade in and out of existence QUICKLY), pick up power-ups
, such as the ability to fly for a short time, extra lives (BOY do you need
those!), mental screens (which block out the thought lightning and protectors
--small spheres whose job is to track and destroy you!).  Yes, you do have a
laser to disrupt these bubbles, but the bubbles, speed of track fading, and
frequency and accuracy of the thought lightning increase as you go deeper and
deeper into the person's mind.

   This game is hard but addicting!  Anyone want to hear more about it? 

-- 
I thought I felt love for you/There was a closeness and warmth that I had
never had before/Yet, it was not love./We both search endlessly for it/
We will not find it within each other/What we have, though, is also/
Special, in and of itself/We are too close to part/Yet too far to love.
 >>>>>>>>>>>>
  does this sound for real? Anyone heard of it or is it this guy's opium dream?

Subj:	Cheap Soda


Greetings sodaheads,
	I have stocked the refrigerator in the common area with various soda
flavors.  These are available to you and yours for the pittance cost of 35
cents per can, (or 45 cents/can for the Koala Springs).  The sodas for sale
are all on the bottom two shelves of the refrigerator in cases.  There are a 
few loose sodas in there already; I put them on the upper shelves so nobody
takes them by mistake.  

Take all that you want, just pay for what you take.  If you don't have cash,
just mark down on the sheet (taped to the refrigerator door) what you've taken,
along with who you are of course.  We'll settle accounts when it's time to buy
more.  I prefer this later method, since it doesn't leave wads of cold cash 
laying in the cooler.  

Let me know if there are flavors you can't live without, and I'll try to get
them, but remember this stuff does come from the Price Club, so the selection
isn't the greatest.  I have more Coke and Diet Coke in my office if the supply
runs low.  These were by far the most popular requested flavors.

					Enjoy,
						- jim
P.S.  Don't forget to recycle the empties.

Subj:	RAD file format changes


I've made some changes to the RAD file format that result in smaller RAD files.
The newer file format starts in the next version of RAD (V1.5) that is in testing
with some of the animators (currently Bridget, Sean & Mark).  

As a result of these changes, the programs that read RAD files on the VAX will 
have to be updated.  I have already converted PBCOLOR, and rewritten RADOPS to 
support the new and old file versions.  If you have any tools of your own that
read RAD files, let me know and I'll give details of the changes (they're fairly
minor).

What this means to you is that I'll be re-releasing any of the VAX tools that read
RAD files as fast as I can get them rewritten and tested.  The newer versions will
be able to read both old and new formats, and will additionally recognize MacBinary
format RAD files.

Today's release is PBCOLOR (it's the first one anybody complained about).
Next stop is CELPROCESS, followed closely by RADMOD.

Sega's "Halogram" game Time Traveller is at Sunnyvale Golfland. 
This is the one that uses a mirror to project a video disk 
image into the middle of a small space. It received a lot of 
attention at ACME. The game play was similar to Dragon's Lair 
-- long annoying pauses when you guess the wrong way to push 
the joystick. But the image is unique! 

Check it out! Report back on your impressions and the player's

Mary, I left youi a message on your answering machine, but here is the scoop
again:


*Jed Margolin heard for Joan at Merit that 64K x 4 DRAM's are in short supply
  with lengthening leadtimes.  150 NS or faster.

* We need to use these on the Multi-Sync PCB being used in STEEL TALONS.
  The usage is :  4 per PCB 
                  8 per Game
	       1000 games in August/September timeframe

* PLEASE SEE IF YOU CAN GET THIS QUANTITY OF DRAMS IN THIS TIMEFRAME.
  We need thsi info in the next day or two.

* As a point of comparison, please get data on the 256K x 4 DRAM, you
  know, price and delivery/leadtime etc. ... 150 Ns or faster.

   .....calling Jed for more info and he reports that:

* Jed has already talked to Mary about this...Jed will not submit 
  Multi-sync to PC Design till this is resolved. Expects to have
  info in a day or two at the most.

* Joe is on vacation so Leon is doing DSIII, could'nt do Multi-sync now
  anyway.

* Multi-sync was entered with "Schemactive" (sp?); has to be converted 
  to Viewlogic before changes can be done.

Scicards supplied a beta test version of the software to us 
yesterday. We do not expect this to be a piece of cake. We have an 
agreement with Sicards to keep the Megatek/VAX system and software 
until this software works satisfactorily. 

The upcoming changes to Multisync will be done with the old system. 
We will be attempting to convert Multisync and other boards to Workview,
(the Viewlogic system) but we will not switch over to this until we 
are satisfied that everything works ok. We hope that the translation 
will be transparent to the end user, but we will let you know when we 
are doing it.

	Max Behensky informed me that downloads will go faster with larger
record sizes.  I did some experiments and found that /rec=2000 instead of 
/rec=250 will reduce download times by 25% or so (your mileage will vary).

	Feel free to vary the sizes and let me know the optimal size.  We
believe this change occured when we added the ethernet to the VAXs.  Do not
try to use /rec=4000 because it will hang the AMS.  I do not know the limit
for the AMS, so if you find the limit let me know about that too.

	How can I remember all these strange CODES???

	It's easy...use the map.

	The MAP?  I don't see no stinkin' MAP!

	It's on your phone.

	Oh.

	Say, how do you use it?

	Glad you asked.  See the areas near each of the keys on the side?
Like near the 1 it says "CONNECT *" and "CAMP-ON #"?  That's to remind you that
CONNECT is * and 1 (that's why it's next to the 1).  Likewise, CAMP-ON is #1.
All the CAMP-ON functions are #1; CANCEL CAMP ON is ##1.  The "normal" codes
all start with # (pound) or * (star), and end in a single digit.  The "undo"
codes are repeats of the pound or star, ending with the same digit.

	On the right side of the phone, it says near the 3 key, "* PICK-UP".
This means PICK-UP is *3, not 3*.  Things starting with digits are assumed to
be phone numbers of some kind:  extensions, trunk access (like paging), outside
calls (actually, the 9 is a special trunk access), and so on.  The function
codes always start with a pound or star.

	Remember that you may need to FLASH before any particular access code!

	For those of you who are into lists, here's the full translation of
the map (other codes exist, but this will get you a long ways):


* 1		CONNECT			* 3 <ext>	Pick up extension
* * 1		garbage			* * 3		GROUP PICK UP

# 1		CAMP ON			# 3 <index>	dial STATION speed no.
# # 1		CANCEL CAMP ON		# # 3 <index> <number> Program sta spd



* 4		ADD ON (conf call)	* 6 <ext>	PARK a call

# 4		SAVE a phone no.	# 6 <2-digit-index> dial SYSTEM spd no.



* 7 <ext>	TRANSFER a call to ext	* 9		Put a call on HARD HOLD

# 7		REPEAT a phone no.	# 9 <ext>	FORWARD my calls to ext
# # 7		nonsense		# # 9		CANCEL forwarding

The 1991 Atari Classic Golf Tournament is history, having been held this past
Saturday at Pleasant Hills.  Special thanks are in order to the following
people for making it a most enjoyable event: Hide Nakajima, for his most
generous donations to help cover costs; Rick Thompson, for his efforts in
lining up an impressive collection of donated prizes; Lois Turner, Matt
Kendall, and Rick Rowe for their efficient handling of the all-important
beer cart (and for reserving the picnic site); and, of course, all who 
helped in organizing the tourney---Rob Rowe, Lois Turner, Jose Sandoval,
Milt Loper, Peter Lipson, and others whom I'm forgetting now. (Sorry.)
Oh yeah---thanks Farrokh for getting the golf lesson coupons.

You all must be wondering who the big winners were.  Well...OK, I'll tell

	FIRST PLACE TEAM (3 under par*): Ralston, Rowe, Rowe, Martins
	SECOND PLACE (3 under*): Momoda, Taylor, Williams, Lanzinger
	THIRD PLACE (Even par): Nakajima, Sheffield, Thompson
	FOURTH PLACE (4 OVER): McComb, McComb, Logg, Mercieca
	LAST PLACE (21 over): Hubberstey, Wrightnour, Moore (John), Mohr

	*The Ralston team took first place honors via an exciting sudden-
death "chip-off" at the ninth green.

	MEN'S CLOSEST TO THE PIN #1:  Hide Nakajima
	MEN'S CLOSEST TO THE PIN #2:  Jerry Momoda
	WOMEN'S CLOSEST TO THE PIN/LONG DRIVE 1ST PLACE:  Becky Rowe
	WOMEN'S CLOSEST TO THE PIN/LONG DRIVE 2ND PLACE:  Kathleen (McComb)
	MEN'S LONGEST DRIVE #1:  Fernando Martins
	MEN'S LONGEST DRIVE #2:  Dave Ralston

still on the right side. Then I removed the MSYNC board from the right side and 
installed another MSYNC board and the problem was still on the right side. I 
figured the MSYNC board was ok so I assumed it was harnessing or power supply 
related. 
	Well, this morning I exchanged complete board sets between the right 
and left sides and the problem changed to the left side!
	I looked at the rams on the MSYNC board and I noticed that 5K,15K,25K, 
and 35K are -10 instead of -12 which are on the development system boards. Can
this be a problem?

I have released new versions of the above programs.  They are in utl$pps.
The difference is that they will deal with the new RAD file format in
addition to the old one.  This means that the users of RAD 1.5 (a.k.a. NRAD)
won't have to convert their files anymore.

As always, if any problems occur, let me know.  If you need the older version
of either of these programs, it now resides in:
	
		EE$USERDISK:[pps.utilities.obsolete]

Yesterday I was making my usual dead complete stop at the four-way
intersection, because I know better. Oliver Sudden, an unmarked Milpitas
patrol car roared out of the parking lot from behind a tree and another
big car to chase after a California stopper. Something suddenly occured
to me! These numbheads are sitting on private property. 

Can they do that? Can't the owners of the property tell them to get lost?
Catching people for traffic violations is not a matter of immeadiate
public safety. They should have to have permission to use the parking lot
like anyone else.

Maybe the only way to get rid of them is to put pressure on the owners of 
the property to ask the police to go elsewhere. Whadda you think?

If Milpitas really is this set on filling their coffers, why don't they
just put a fu**ing toll booth on Barber Lane?

Milt;
	Last night, Jed measured the thumper at 119db.  I have asked Rick 
Meyette for the UL or lawfull noise levels permitted.  Considering the short 
time we have left before release, I believe we may need an electrical 
engineer to help you design this to meet the noise requirements.

	Suggestions I have heard are: reduce the throw of the solenoid,
use a smaller solenoid, reduce the voltage to the soleneoid, add rubber
stops to the solenoid, ....

	I have asked Rick Moncrief whether Jed is the engineer on the project
or if I should ask PaT McCarthy for assistance.  I should have an answer today.

The 2 DIO model 288's have had firmware changes (from rev 2.? to rev 5.1).
Evidently they made lots of little changes. The main change is the ability
to use a faster programming algorithm on some of the TI Eproms. The next most
significant change is the ability to program 4Mbit Eproms.

Among the little changes was the addition of another byte of checksum. I
changed the DIO programs on the VAX to both verify using a 24 bit checksum and
also to report the 24 bit checksum (note that the lower 16 bits continue to
represent the old checksum values).

	Have you ever started a phone conversation and KNOWN that the other
party was not having a good day, just by how they spoke?  That's called
emotional leakage.  Everyone is prone to it.

	If you're having a bad time, let the phone ring a little longer
while you count to ten or recite your mantra or do whatever it is you
do to calm down and change gears.  Your caller may never know, but if
they did, that's the path they would want to take anyways.

	Sometimes you'll connect with someone who is "leaking."  Perhaps
they just spilled coffee on their desk or clothes, or they're calling with
a problem--their computer just dumped an hour's work.  Realise that they
are angry or frustrated with their situation, and not with you.  Simply
knowing that you are not the target makes the storm easier to weather.
DO try not to get swept up, even if you are the target of someone's anger,
temporarily or otherwise.

	And remember:  Smile.

I have created a new version of RADMOD in UTL$EXE that deals with the new
RAD file format, so files created with the new rad (v1.5) don't have to be
converted first.

I had to really look to find all the pieces to RADMOD, so I don't know if
all of them are the most recent.  Everything I tested seemed to work, but
RADMOD is fairly complex, and I'm sure I didn't test everything, so I left
the older version in UTL$EXE::RADMOD_OLD.EXE.  If you have any problems with
the new version, please let me know.  You can always use the older version
until any bugs you find are corrected.

	Thanks for your patience,

To whom it may concern:


	The MultiSync board which was used in Compact Hard Drivin',
Compact Race Drivin', Stun Runner, and Panorama, and which will be
used in Steel Talons, was designed to produce a video output in
accordance with Atari Standard Video, namely:

	Black Level: 0.5V
	Low Level:   1.0V
	Peak White:  3.5V

The monitors used in Stun Runner did not meet this standard and saturated
long before the video reached 3.5V. I installed resistors to reduce the video
to levels that the monitors could handle.

Since Rick Meyette has apparently discontinued the practice of approving 
monitors that do not meet his own specifications, I will have the Steel Talons
boards configured to produce 3.5V Peak White video.

If Rick Meyette wants to resume the practice of approving non-spec monitors,
I don't want to hear the complaints when there are problems with the displays
on the production line.

By the way, he has a board set in his lab and could have easily measured the
video output.

Also, I strongly recommend to the project team that they inspect their boards
to verify the absence of: R97, R108, and R112.

They should also verify that their monitors are tracked properly; otherwise
the game won't look right on Production monitors, and Meyette will assume
it is my fault.

A reminder:

	When Tam brings over the ASICs on Tuesday morning to program for
Road Riot please make sure he also brings the labels. The labels should 
say "B" .

	The programming station will be set up for Road Riot, which means
the program Version is 2.0 (Race Drivin' was 1.3).

     On your preliminary parts list for DSPCOM, item # 4 does not appear
  in MANMAN nor on the AVL.  I wanted to mention it to you, as perhaps 
  there is a CER pending.  The part number is 137023-002, 74LS74.  Perhaps
  you can let me know what's the deal?  Thanks and have a good weekend.

	Don't you just HATE to talk to rude people on the phone?  Well,
SO DO THEY.  Yes, YOU can be just as rude as the people you despise.

	Like the way this is going?  Of course not.  It's arrogant,
it talks down to you, and you feel like you know better.  Unfortunately,
sometimes we DO sound like we are above dealing with people on the phone.

	We can make this happen less often by avoiding certain trigger
phrases.  These are things "nobody likes to hear--not a spouse, not a
child, and least of all, a customer."

	I DON'T KNOW should be replaced with an offer to find out.

	WE CAN'T DO THAT should come with a sincere apology, and only
when there are no alternatives to offer.

	YOU'LL HAVE TO ... is a lie.  The caller doesn't HAVE to do
anything.  It feels much different to hear, "In order for that to happen,
we need you to ..."

	JUST A SECOND never is.  If you feel the need to excuse yourself
from the conversation, ask if the caller is willing to hold for a minute
or two.  Don't simply presume that they have nothing better to do than wait.

	NO, at the beginning of a sentence.  If you avoid saying NO as
the first word, you force yourself to project a positive image, and even if
you must deny a request, you put the caller in your camp by giving reasons
or making the caller feel like you didn't WANT to say no, even if you had to.


	These changes can't happen overnight.  It takes a while to affect
speech patterns; it takes a while just to realize you have them.  When you
hear yourself utter one of these trigger phrases, simply think of how you
could have phrased things differently...and before too long, you'll use
those speech patterns instead.

	And people will call you just to hear you talk...

Subj:	Steel Talons FCC game


This is an important week. We have to get another Steel Talons cabinet
functional for the FCC test scheduled for the week of 6/3. If the FCC test
slips, it is possible that the Doc release on 6/17 will slip too.

Pete's group is building up the cabinet and will supply everything but
the PCB's.  

Glen/Erik need to supply the PCB's:

	Glen: (2) Multi-sync with all mods including SLOOP and SCOM interrupt.
		        Mods have to be extra neat and close to PCB.
	      (2) SA2S
	      (1) Rump Thump
                   Glen: please see Stevie and see if she needs any PCB's to
                         assist in the harness layout; I gave her (2) Multi-
			 Syncs and (1) SA2S PCB.

	ERIK: (2) DSIII (if we have to, we can take them from Lipson's bench)
	      (2) DSPCOM (Lipson has DSPLINKS - no good: Need DSPCOM w/ASIC 65)

PROBLEM: Erik Durfey and Rick Moncrief are on VACATION all week.
          Can Jed supply the needed PCB's?

PROBLEM: Ed & Ed's bench setup is still running DSPLINK PCB's - is firmware
         compatible between DSPCOM and DSPLINK? 

PROBLEM: Controls may not arrive til Thursday - then Jerry's group has to
		construct them.

Let's try to get the game (cabinet is currently in Harness area) running by
6/3/91 at 5 PM even though the odds look low right now.

Subj:	Sound Call Symbols


	There have been many requests for different 'include' formats for audio
call symbols through the years.  These files are produced when a new audio
program is linked.  Currently we can produce five different formats for you. 

	Just so y'all are up to date, I'll list the formats that we can produce.
You can decide for yourself which one you would like to use.  We suggest
however, that if you can, that you use the 'audio.asm' format as this is the
fastest way to include new audio calls.  As shown below, 'audio.asm' contains
EQU for each symbol.  This takes no space in your program and you only have to 
re-link your program (not re-compile) to be up-to-date with the audio calls.

FORMAT:  'audio.ol'

.id "date" "May 24 1991 16:59:24"

Regarding Glenn's message (see below), I think that the fan on the bottom 
blowing down and out is our best bet right now. If it passes the heat test
then I would favor it. Moncrief expressly asked that any fan mounted near the
floor should be an exhaust fan to avoid sucking in dust. Jed's opinion would
count more heavily than mine...

Subj:	Steel Talons fan

	Someone needs to decide how the fan should be mounted in Steel Talons 
for production. It's Jed's hardware so he should have input. ID is at a loss 
of where to put the fan for the production cabinets. They asked me and I 
suggested on top of the cabinet, but they said no because it's too close to 
the monitors. The side is out because of the possibility of other games 
blocking the airflow. I suggested having the fan at the bottom blowing air 
down and out the rear with holes, but this can be a problem because hot air 
rises. I told ID not to do it this way until there was more input from other 
people, but they did it that way for the next game. Moncrief suggested having 
the fan blowing out the back, but the audio boards would have to be stacked to
make room.

Only Steel Talons is using Rump Thump. Moncrief has no need for it on

at 10 - we have not missed something as far as I know right now. Thanks for 
the concern though.

Wayne Winther, the local rep for DATA I/O is coming in tomorrow to 
go over the details of a UNISITE programmer which I plan to purchase.

There are several modules for the UNISITE so I want to make sure we 
get what we need. The unisite is primarily a PAL/GAL/FPGA/EPLD 
universal logic programmer, though there is EPROM gang programmer 
module available also.

Also ABEL-4 for VMS is finally released. This version has many new 
features including the ability to process logic without specifying 
the target device. We will be upgrading to ABEL 4 but we will not get 
the retargetters unless we need them. 

If you have other issues to raise, or have specific requirements for 
logic programming that we need to be able to handle (Other that the 
regular PALs/GALs that we use now, please let me know and I will 
cover it or you can come by.

The START button lamp on RACE RIOT is extremely dim. (It is hard to

problem. The 2N3904 solution is not significantly better to be a

THAT YOU FILL ONE OUT AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED THE GAMES UP AND RUNNING.  

THESE FORMS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE ENGINEERING COMMON AREA, WHICH IS 
ALSO WHERE ALL THE GREAT FOOD/DRINKS WILL BE.  You can write down your
comments while munching.  We will summarize all of your suggestions 
and make them available to the teams.  

GAMES EXPECTED TO BE UP AND RUNNING FOR TOMORROW:  

o  STEEL TALONS
o  BMX HEAT
o  STREAK SHOOTER (HORSE)
o  DANGER EXPRESS

Subj:	hello and how do you do?


Hello.......

I have good news for those of you who miss Weird Stuff. There is a new
business called "Curtis Trading" to fill the void. Curtis Trading is located
on Milpitas Blvd near the corner of Yosemite. They deal more in big stuff
like furniture, computers, test equipment, software, metro carts, etc.
It looks like they are getting into smaller stuff, but they don't have
the piles of junk that Weird Stuff had. The big difference, though, is
.......they are really nice! (can you believe it?) When I walk in they
say, "Hi Carole!" And they wave at me every Saturday and Sunday when I
ride by on my bike. So, if you go there, be sure to say biker Carole
sent you.

Also, reserve a time in your schedule this weekend or next week to go
to Camera One to see "Citizen Kane". This movie has always been called
the greatest movie ever made. I had seen it several times on television
and always thought it was really good, but wasn't convinced it was the
best ever. Well, you have to see the film version on a big screen to
appreciate it. I sat in the theater saying to myself, "This IS the 
best film ever made."  The photography is incredible! They must have
lightened it up for video on tv. It is so beautifully shot, dark and
brooding. There are scenes when the characters are speaking from a
complete shadow. It is totally cool, no director now would do the
stuff in this film, it couldn't possibly be done in color, it's
awesome, go see it!!!!

ok bye

After cutting the split pad that connects J6 pins 6 & 7 together I noticed that 
pins 6 & 7 are swapped on the pcb. Pin 7 should be pin 6 and pin 6 should be 
pin 7 according to the schematic.

Subj:	Prototype boards


    Hello. Just a quick question as to who will supply the following GALs
  on the following boards when we build these for you:

    A049096-01  DS III PCB   
          136087-9002, -9003, -9004

    A049349-01  DSPCOM PCB
          136087-9005, -9006

    I am trying to have these boards completed by Monday, July 8th.  
  I've used the parts lists you gave me for everything, so, should 
  anything happen to change between now and then please let me know.
  If you want to do the GALs yourself, let me know if I should supply
  you with the raw parts.  Perhaps we could give Joan a call, invite
  her into your office and see what she could supply.  She's good at
  GALs......Anyway, let me know.....Also, did you know.....
     Mary Burnias has been talking to TI.  They are having problems
  with the ASIC 65 falling out, not testing properly, failing, etc....
  I am already short to one of my kits to the floor for Road Riot.
  Is there anybody you can talk to at TI to help the situation?  This
  is getting to be a serious problem.  Probably Mary has talked to you
  already.....
     Thanks for your help.

    Hello. Just a quick answer as to who will supply the following GALs
  on the following boards when you build these for whomever:

    A049096-01  DS III PCB   
          136087-9002, -9003, -9004

    A049349-01  DSPCOM PCB
          136087-9005, -9006

    You will.

    (I will supply the masters if you tell me when you need them by. Also,
     the JEDEC files will be available on a Floppy)

The MultiSync Board (Rev B) uses one GAL (136087-9001). Pat McCarthy is in 
charge of that GAL, so I suggest you ask him.
 
There has been a small change to the DS III parts list. Since I am scheduled 
to deliver to Leon the final changes for the DS III and DSPCOM Boards today 
I will have to get back to you later today or tomorrow.

I am sorry you are having problems getting working ASIC65s from TI.

I talked to the TI rep about the ASIC65s. He said he would try to arrange
a conference call on Thursday with a TI engineer and myself. However you
should know that:

	1. I did not design this IC; TI did. I am not responsible for
	   ICs designed by persons other than myself.

	2. I do not run their Fab line. I am not responsible for 
	   ICs produced on Fab lines other than my own.

        3. I am not in charge of purchasing parts; see Mary Burnias. Or
	   Tom Smith.
	   
	4. This is the fourth TI rep we have had in the last 18 months. When
	   I called him he didn't have a clue as to who I was even after I
	   introduced myself.


Regarding ASIC65b. When we programmed parts for Race Drivin' we put an
'ok' label on them. For Roard Riot we put a 'B'. For Steel Talons we will
put a 'C'. I thought it would be nice to indicate on the parts list which
went with what game. I have since reconsidered and the parts list will simply
say 'ASIC 65'.



Regards,


Jed

We have upgraded the Tektronix printer to speak Postscript.  This means you
can now print directly from the Macintosh to the TEK.  Unfortunately this
also means that the TEK program no longer works.  I've rewritten TEK
to output Postscript, but it doesn't work right as yet.  I hope to finish

	You need to talk to ____, and RIGHT NOW!!  You tried CAMP, but they've
been on the phone for MINUTES.  How do I let them know I'm waiting?

	HOLD on, a minute.  Put yourself on HOLD!

	Yes, that's right.  Put yourself on HOLD...on their phone.  They'll get
the soft beep letting them know you're waiting on them, and unless they are
doing something uninteruptible, they can CONNECT with you to find out what's
wrong.

	Here's how:  Call them!  Dial their extension.  Listen to the busy
signal.  What a nice rhythm it has.  How peaceful the slow beat is...  HEY!
When it disappears, they've been notified.  Hang on, you're on hold, and they
know about you now.  They may use CONNECT to talk to you, or simply close up
the call they were on.  If they finish the call, you'll ring through.  If not,
you'll have plenty to discuss...

	How do you know if it worked?  The busy signal goes away.  Actually,
there are two busy signals.  You get a fast busy if someone is already on hold.
In that event, when you don't get the hint (listening to the fast busy waiting
for it to go away), you'll eventually get switched to the error tone.

Are any of these going to be OTP'S? If so then the numbers will be different.

Ed,

John Moore said these are the possible stuffing options for the SAIIS ADPCM:

Four 1M, 
Two 2M, 
One 4M, 
Two 4M.

So it looks to me that if I reserve part numbers for four 1M and two 2M, it will
take care of all possible options, correct? This assumes that the 4M's will 
replace the 2M's, which Pat says will be decided later?

	For those programmers out there who will be using Microtec, do 
not use the symbol "msp" in your C or ASM files.  This symbol is a reserved
symbol.  Apparently, there is a register of that name on the 68020.  Thus the

	I worked with Jeff Bell today on the CER to reserve SAIIS audio board 
programmed part numbers and he had me input "See Attached Document" instead of 
the actual part numbers that you two want to use. What this means is that I 
need to tell components where the AROMREL.DOC resides. Jed, Ed has created a
release directory called [LOGG.ACE.RELEASE] in which this file should reside.
If you like I can copy and edit it, and then have Ed copy it to the release 
directory, or if you prefer you can edit it with the following info:

136087- 5001 512k eprom Audio program location 1F
      - 5002   1M eprom Adpcm loc 1M
      - 5005   1M eprom Adpcm loc 1R 
      - 5006   2M eprom Adpcm loc 1M
      - 5007   2M eprom Adpcm loc 1N
      - 5008   4M eprom Adpcm loc 1M

If we eventually go to 4M eproms for Adpcm is there an existing Atari p/n or 
will I need to request one, I look in the AVL and couldn't find one.

Subj:	Online VAX training


We have a test copy of a program called User Basics Tutor. This program is
supposed to be a learning tool where one can gain a very basic understanding
of the operation and use of a Vax computer. This program is only for the
very novice users or those who don't know diddly about a computer.

It'll take about 2 hours to run through the program, but anytime after the
first 5 minutes (the first lesson), you can stop and be able to resume the
course at a later time.

I think the program expires in a couple of days, so today and tomorrow are
the only time you have to try this. I signed up as a test location for it
and have some simple before and after questionaires that the writers asked
that those who run the tutor complete. In any event, let me know what you
think of it, good or bad (I have some strong opinions already).

You can run it the next time you login or RESTART by entering UBT at the
dollar sign prompt. It draws a picture of a keyboard which may or may not
match the keyboard you are using. The PF1, PF2, PF4 and ENTER or RETURN
keys are about the only ones of significance. If you can find those keys
on your keyboard, you can successfully run this program. If you are using
a PC, it might draw the text wierd. You might get two copies of everything
or the letters will appear with spaces between them. If this is too much
to deal with, let me know because I want the writers to know too.

Good luck.

Subj:	Steel Talons' Programmed Parts


The following is the ROM Release procedure that I suggest be used for
Steel Talons. It is the procedure used for Panorama. 

Requirements:
   1. There should be a single file (AROMRELx.DOC) that contains all the 
      information needed to produce the latest Masters to build a game.
      This file is created and maintained by the Project Team.

   2. This file should not contain unnecessary information such as ROMs that
      have been superseded.

Reason:
      Previously, the parts lists maintained by the PC Group contained
all the latest programmed part numbers. When a part was raised another
Rev level the parts list was ECNed.

      With Component Engineering's new system this is no longer the case.
I believe this is related to the new numbering system. Previously the Rev 
level was built into the part number so that 136087-1001 was a Rev A part,
136087-2001 was a Rev B part, and so on. With the new system the part is
labeled with the Rev level: "136087-1001 Rev A", "136087-1001 Rev B", and
so on. The parts list is not changed as the Rev level is changed. The parts
list would continue to call out "136087-1001".

     Therefore, there must be another document that tells Manufacturing what
ROMs (and other programmed parts) to put into the game.

     Said document is the dreaded AROMRELx.DOC  .
 
     When you first release Rev A parts, the information goes in AROMREL.DOC .

Next is where my procedure might be different from the one specified by
Components Engineering:

    When you release more Rev A parts or change the Rev level of existing
parts you will create a new AROMRELx.DOC such as AROMREL2.DOC, AROMREL3.DOC,
and so on.

   The latest AROMRELx.DOC will contain all the programmed parts necessary
to build the game. It will not contain parts that have been superseded.

For Steel Talons the AROMRELx.DOC files should be located in
[Logg.Aces.Release]  .

Rev A parts should be in [Logg.Aces.Release.ROMREVA] .
Rev B parts should be in [Logg.Aces.Release.ROMREVB] .

Note that a game can (and usually does) have programmed parts at several 
different Rev levels.

When you are planning to release parts try to notify Rick Owens ahead of
time, preferably a few days. To release ROMs give him a copy of the new
AROMRELx.DOC along with the masters of the parts you are releasing.

Do not give him masters of parts that have already been released.

Rick Meyette says that he was able to get Steel Talons to pass the FCC test
as of about 3PM today. Changes include:
	1) Metal Standoffs between PCBs (Jed said that official release

					    metal stand-offs...)
	2) Filter caps on DSIII - I believe Rick said he would supply input
	     to PCB design - I did not ask him to do it one way or the other.
		This is up to Jed.

	3) Beads on Harness(es) - I did not ask how many.

Subj:	STEEL TALON'S PROGRAMMED PARTS


The Program Master Release Form, which is updated with each software revision,
will document the revision levels of the programmed parts to be stuffed in the
board. Each PCB assembly has a separate PMR form that is included with the
parts list and assembly drawing for the board.

The PMR form is generated or revised from the AROMREL form when the programmed
parts are released. Using Jed's system will make it easier for us to update the
PMR form when there are software revisions.

Subj:	Virus...Virus...Virus


As you may be aware, there are many amoral and sadistic programmers out there
and they have written programs for the PC's called Viruses. These programs hide
silently inside a legitimate application. Once you run the application on your
computer, they spring to life, and clone themselves into your computer and
continue to clone themselves into every computer they contact,. Once a part of
your machine, they do various things ranging from cute to destructive. And I
mean destructive. Many of the viruses intentionally destory data on your disk!!

The most popular way for viruses to spread is through "shareware" or other
"free" software particularly when downloaded from a BBS (Bulletin Board
Service). We now have more and more PC's in Engineering and they are NETWORKED
together which means a virus on one computer easily spreads to ALL the 
computers. This means a virus can corrupt and destroy all our work. You have
a responsibility to your yourself, your fellow workers and the Company to
avoid introducing viruses.

           AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE

RULE #1: Only commercially purchased software may be loaded directly into 
         any PC on the Atari Games Network. 

RULE #2: Think twice before copying any piece of software from one machine
         to another. Is the source computer "clean"??? Is this piece of
	 software proven clean???

RULE #3: If you want to install downloaded or shareware/freeware software
         on Atari Games Computers: 1) Download it from a reputable BBS; AND 
         2) use it regularly for at least 2 months on your personal property 
         computer (not on network) and verify its cleaness.

Feedback on this approach to viruses is solicited.
If this "on-your-honor" approach fails, we will have to take a harder line.

Subj:	Steel Talons NY Introduction


Rich announced in this morning's status meeting that the Steel Talons
Product Introduction Plan is offical and dates are confirmed:

	WHAT: Steel Talons Product Introduction
	WHEN: July 29, 1991
	WHERE: New York, Time-Warner Building
	How Many: (2) complete cabinets

(This is a one-city introduction and (2) cabinets is the entire requirement;
 we are not doing the 11-city road show that required (5) cabinets. I will
 still ask Mfg. to build enough PCB's for the originally planned (5) games)

Manufacturing is shut-down  (completely) 7/22 through 8/2 so facilities
to pack and ship the games will not normally be available. Options are:

1) Ship games Thurs. 7/18 w/o PCB's; Hand-carry PCB's to show. Assumes cabinets
   can be ready. I would want to send someone out 2 working days before the 
   show to install the PCB's and make sure everything is perfect. If the
   distibutor (?) holding the games for us is closed on weekends that means
   flying the PCB's to New York on Wednesday 7/24/91.

2) Make special arrangements to bring Mfg. staff in to arrange AIR shipment
   on Tuesday 7/23 for the NY Intro on Monday, 7/29.

I prefer option (1).  Comments?
Also, who is receiving the games in New York? A distributor?

After doing inventory a few days ago I discovered that we went from 17 cents too
much in the till to $18.08 too little.  As I said from the start, as long as this
plan breaks even (more or less), I'll continue buying soda.  Well, $18 is not
breaking even, so kiss the cheap sodas goodbye.  Please pay me what you owe me
so I can finish this plan off.  It's too bad you can't trust your own co-workers

We are all extremely honest people around here right! Or are we? Or is someone

On Steel Talons I am not using using 1M 150 ns EPROMs on the MultiSync,

BMX can use up to ten 1M 150 ns EPROMs on the Memory Expansion Board. I
don't know how many Bonnie will actually use. Also, I don't know what the
Audio Board uses (it is the same one used on Steel Talons).

Street Driver will probably use 1M 150 ns EPROMs on the DSK Board.

It's easy. We just design alittle box that takes are money, counts it,
and keeps it secure. Then we just design a little thing that dispenses
the soda, one at a time. We make it so we can choose which soda we want.
It has to keep the soda cold. I guess it should have some way of making 
sure you are using real money. Maybe it can even make change. Oh yeah,
it would be great if it let us know when one kind of soda is out. We could
even pay someone for the convenience of buying the sodas and keeping it
full.

I (with generous portions of help from Lyle) have finished altering Tek to output
Postscript, so now you can all use it from the VAX again.  I've noticed one caveat,
however; if you cancel a print job (DELETE/ENTRY=nnn TEK), the next print job will
also abort.  If you cancel two in a row, it seems to screw up the tek print queue,
which can be fixed by some combination of turning the printer off and back on, and
STOP/RESET/QUE=TEK, then START TEK on the VAX.

Enjoy, but to be safe, don't cancel print jobs.

I need to request all employees help in insuring that Atari
Games get the most competitive pricing on all office equipment
and office supply requests.  If you are attempting to purchase
any materials, please contact me before placing the order.  
Many times an item appears less expensive through a mail order
catalog, but when shipping and handling is included, the cost
exceeds what Atari Games would pay through a local supplier.

If you have a vague idea of what you want to purchase, stop by
my office (knock if the door is shut), call me on Ext. 3746 or
vax me at 'Dave' and I will let you look through my catalogs.
If you have found exactly what you want in a catalog, at a show-
room, etc., BEFORE placing the order, let me know and I will
check local prices and we will decide, the quickest and least
costly supplier.

Please remember to coordinate through your local Office Services
Coordinator, Dave Pasquinelli, for all office supplies, equipment,
or any related items.

Thanks!

	Didja ever feel like camping on someone's doorstep to make sure
you got to talk to them?

	Well, that's the origin of the CAMP function.  When you GOTTA talk
to someone, as SOON as they're off the phone, then CAMP on their line!  As
soon as they hang up, your phone will ring--a long, steady ring.  You'll know
it when you hear it.  Pick up your phone, and theirs will ring (you'll get
a busy signal if they hung up just long enough to start another call...and
you took too long).  Then discuss your urgent business.

	How to do it?  Simplicity itself!  Call their extension -- they're
on the phone, right?  DON'T HANG UP.  Instead, if you have a CAMP button,
press it.  Otherwise, FLASH if appropriate, and dial pound, one.  You'll get
a (normal) dial tone back.  It's all set.  Hang up and wait for the phone to 
ring!

	What if the problem goes away, and you no longer need (or maybe
want) to talk to them?  Pick up the phone--you should get a normal dial tone.
Dial pound, pound 1.  You won't be bothered by the annoying long ring that you
no longer want to answer.

	What if you forget, and leave your phone?  Don't worry.  If the long
ring isn't answered, the system assumes you no longer need the service.

I received the Rev A Memory Expansion Boards (049097-01) yesterday.

They will probably work except there is a small problem.

On the component side of the board, parts usually have square pads on

Rev 1 boards had them.

The plots I received for this Rev A board had them.

 I lost several months of data on my own PC to "JERUSALEM strain B." that

for it to completely cripple my PC, it eventually penetrated all my system,
.exe, and .com files until the computer came to a grinding halt.  

 Needless to say that the department deen denied the possibility of passing
out viruses from schools computers.  So later I checked every PC in the lab 
and discovered viruses on 2 PCs using my new virus checkerssss (I'm currently

 With so many PCs here, we ought to install an antivirus software on them

First of all, thanks to all those who responded.  Now here's the scoop.

We have been given leave to go see the 5:35 showing ONLY on Friday.
Since matinee prices switch at 5:45 PM on weekdays, the cost will be
$3.75 per person attending.  Rich Moore has kindly offered to cover
Popcorn...   I would like to have the money by 3:30 PM today.

A side note is that I was planning on taking the afternoon off that
Friday and I was going to leave early enough to hold a spot in line.

Right now, it looks like I won't be able to get out of an obligation
that I have later that evening which would make going to the 5:30
showing impossible.  In this even, someone else will need to step
forward to hold a place in line for the gang.  Any volunteers?

Subj:	 EMPLOYEES IN NEED


For those of you who don't know, Rhonda Allen and Steve Williamson are Atari
employees who met at Atari, fell in love, and plan to be married this Saturday.
Sounds like a storybook romance and it has been until this past Tuesday at 2
a.m. when they were awaken by their dog barking and someone yelling "fire".

Everyone is fine, but their duplex was destroyed along with most of their
furniture and clothes.  The wedding is still a go, and after some thought, so
is the honeymoon cruise.

Atari is making a donation to the couple to help them get on their feet again
and I am sure there are employees who would like to do the same.  All monies
(checks should be made out to Atari Games) can be given to either
Melanie Martin (in building 735) or to the Human Resources Department.  A list
of donors names, not the amount donated, will be given to the couple.  If you
wish your gift to be anonymous, please let us know and we will honor your
request.

Subj:	GALs


I have changed the operation of the GAL on the DS III Board at location 1A/B.

This GAL is used in selecting the Graphics ROMs; these ROMs can be either
27C512s or 27C010s depending on whether there is a pin header in G0.

	Old was: No Header = 27C512, Header = 27C010

I have changed it to:

	No Header = 27C010, Header = 27C512

On DS III boards starting with Rev 2, the 68010 can read the state of
Pin Header G0. Self-Test starting with Version 2.4 uses this so it can 
correctly compute checksums.

I would like to have all DS III Boards to have the new GAL. It is a 16V8-25
and the file is [Margolin.GALs.Release]DS3_ROM.JED. The old part has a checksum
of 4177; the new part has a checksum of 4178.

At the same time, the games should get the latest Self-Test which is
[Margolin.Aces]STAL2_4.VLDA [Note that Self-Test is not yet finished.]

(When I release the GALs I will ask to have the files moved to 
[Logg.Ace.Release.ROMREVA].)

DS III Rev 1 boards can be modified to have this feature:

	1. On bottom of board, Cut the trace going to 6P pin 19;
	2. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 19 to 5J pin 1; 
	3. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 11 to pin header G0; 
	4. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 9 to 5D pin 6.

Subj:	Steel Talons Elevated Temp Heat test


Our normal procedure is to operate a PCB set at 70 degrees centigrade 
in the Components Engineering Oven. This would be impractical with Steel
Talons so we put a complete game in the Mfg. Heat room (typical temp 120
degrees Farenheit) and let it run over the weekend, 6/21 - 6/24. 

I saw no problems upon observing video on Monday Morning. Moncrief will 
ask Erik Durfey to make a visual check as well. I will remove the game
about 3PM on Monday, allowing anyone else to observe the heat test game.

Subj:	Featured feature


	DOO dah, DOO dah, DOO dah ...

	You did something wrong, right?

	Well,... wrong.

	The ROLM system uses tones to "talk" to you.  You get a "dial tone"
to acknowledge that what you dial will be honored.  You get a "busy signal"
to let you know your call was blocked.  In fact, there are several different
dial tones, and busy signals, and ringing signals, to pass on different
"flavors" of information.  One example:  a double ring is used for an outside 
call, and single for inside.

	So there is a signal for "??? HUH ???"  When you dial a code that
the phone system doesn't understand, you get what is known as Error Tone.
It sounds a lot like a European siren (ambulance, some police), with a fairly
rapid alternation of two pitches.  The phone system is telling you, "I don't
understand," or "I can't."

	An example is if you dial the code for a feature we don't have (like
Maid Request).  Another example is for a code we could have but didn't put
in (like Display Time).  One more is for a code that you're not allowed to
do (like Test Trunk).  Yet another is trying to put two many people on hold,
or "camping on" more than one extension at a time.  These are all things that
can't be done.  The phone system considers this an error on its part, and
gives you the "error tone".

Subj:	UL TESTS - BMX HEAT


Due to a multitude of problems and unresolved design changes, I am delaying the
UL tests on BMX Heat until Thursday, July 11. In order to avoid having to
repeat this testing at later date, I need to have the following by that date.

1. NUMFA Board - A working REV 2 prototype board with a sample of the Magnetek
   and Signal transformers.

2. Motor Filter - A working prototype filter assembly, including the heatsink
   or metal chassis.

3. Platform Covers - All platform covers, installed on the prototype game.

4. Plastic Materials - Specification of the plastic materials to be used for
   the platform covers, nylon insulators, and any other molded platic parts on
   this game.

5. Software - A working program that will interface with the NUMFA board in
   game play, and include self-test routines to exercise the motor and fan.

6. Harnesses - All changes in the harnesses layout to be incorporated in the
   UL/FCC game, including the revised motor cable and harnesses to the NUMFA
   board.

7. Power Supply - Production prototype power supply assembly, with the covers
   for the fuse block and terminal block installed.

Subj:	DS III Rev 1 Mods


I have changed the operation of the GAL on the DS III Board at location 1A/B.

This GAL is used in selecting the Graphics ROMs; these ROMs can be either
27C512s or 27C010s depending on whether there is a pin header in G0.

	Old was: No Header = 27C512, Header = 27C010

I have changed it to:

	No Header = 27C010, Header = 27C512

On DS III boards starting with Rev 2, the 68010 can read the state of
Pin Header G0. Self-Test starting with Version 2.4 uses this so it can 
correctly compute checksums.

I would like to have all DS III Boards to have the new GAL. It is a 16V8-25
and the file is [Margolin.GALs.Release]DS3_ROM.JED. The old part has a checksum
of 4177; the new part has a checksum of 4178.

At the same time, the games should get the latest Self-Test which is
[Margolin.Aces]STAL2_4.VLDA [Note that Self-Test is not yet finished.]


(When I release the GALs I will ask to have the files moved to 
[Logg.Ace.Release.ROMREVA].)


DS III Rev 1 boards can be modified to have this feature:

	1. On bottom of board, Cut the trace going to 6P pin 19;
	2. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 19 to 5J pin 1; 
	3. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 11 to pin header G0; 
	4. Connect a wire jumper from 6P pin 9 to 5D pin 6.

	I still haven't had time to mod your DSIII board yet, but tomorrow I 
should have the time after getting back from bringing Talons to Regency.

	Also, Rick Owens had me verify the gals you released for the DSPCOM & 
the DSIII and there were no problems, they all work fine.

	And, we did another ESD test and got power-up resets when the coin door
was zapped with 15KV. Meyette found that installing a ground from the coin door 
frame to the power supply base corrects the problem.

Subj:	AMD MACH PLDs


I attended a focus group last nught on PLDs and several of the participants
mentioned the AMD MACH series. Their comments were uniformly negative and
centered mainly around a large list of problems with the design software and
attempting to pry information from AMD on how it worked. 

I felt that I should pass this on in case anyone is considering using these
parts.

It was also mentioned that there is a problem with Altera parts. It seems
that the input portion of the pin driver is prone to oscillation (circa 50MHz)
in the presense of slowly changing signals such as tri-stated busses. This
creates noise on the internal power rails and can cause problems even if the
input is not being used.

Subj:	Steel Talons PCB's


Mfg. is building some PCB's for us. Glenn and I met with Ken Williams and
Jim Buchannan this morning and agreed to help each other out toward the goal
of having Manufacturing Build AND test the PCB's. Up until our convseration
this morning, Mfg. was going to build them only (no test).

Mfg. is building 20 Multi-syncs, 40 DSIII's 36 DSPCOM's. 17 sets are for
Steel Talons, the rest are for other Engineering needs.

The PCB's will be assembled 7/3/91. I expect testing to begin in earnest 7/8.

Steel Talons needs (6) board sets completed and tested by 7/11/91 - 
	           (2) for the (1) Dist. Sample game due week of 7/8
		   (4) for the NY intro show games due week of 7/15.
We will need the rest of the boards by 7/19/91.

Ken Williams is checking on what shortages Mfg. might have.  Glenn will
have to fill the shortages. Areas for concern are:
		EPROMS
		GALS
		PCB assy parts (Stand-offs, ribbon cables)
		PAT 9000 plug and Harness
		Test procedure
		2105's, ASIC 65's

DS III Costs								1 of 3
------------
DS III Stuffed to do Graphics only (no Sound, no DSP Link) with	
512K Byte Graphics EPROM (equivalent to 8 27C512 vs. 6 for ADSP II); 

Total Materials: $153.76

The DS III stuffed for Graphics Only should cost $39.17 less than the ADSP II
for what should be at least the same and probably greater performance. This
includes four 1M EPROMs equivalent to eight 27C512s.

The difference between a DS III that does Sound and Graphics and a DS III that
just does Graphics is $221.62 - $153.76 = $67.86 (Material only), and
		      $279.19 - $194.61 = $84.55 (Material+Labor+Overhead).

How much does the SA Audio cost, with ROMs, Labor, and Overhead? 

Here is how it compares:
					Material  Labor   Overhead     Total
					--------  -----   --------    -------
	Driver Sound   A046491-02	$127.40   $6.17   $50.40      $183.97
	ADSP II	       A047046-03	$192.93	  $4.45   $36.40      $233.78

	We are running out of numbers!!

	In late 1991, Pacific Bell will begin to require (408) prefixes
to dial a 1 before any area code.  This is already the case in the (415)
area code.  The bottom line is that YOU MUST dial 9(to get out)-1-area-number
after this starts, and 9(to get out)-number for 408 numbers on our phone
system.

	This dialing is available and will work now, if you choose to switch
gradually, or like me, live in (415) and have to do it anyways.  After the
change, you'll get the recordings of "have to dial a one" and "a one is not
necessary" at the appropriate times.  Contrary to popular opinion, they
DO need to issue the messages, because a few months after they start, they
can no longer tell (nor insert it for you).

	For the curious and terminally bored, the reason for the change is
as follows.  Area codes are supposed to always have a 1 or 0 as the middle
digit, and exchanges (the group of three that start a seven-digit number)
are supposed to NOT have a 0 or 1 as the middle digit.  They have begun to
run out of exchanges, and are going to have to create exchanges that are
against the rules.  So, since there may be a 903 prefix and a 903 area code,
when you dial a number starting with 903, they'll assume you want the newly
created phone numbers for the apartments going up across town.  Since this
would make area (903) inaccessable (and others as each prefix was set up)
the one in the front tells the equipment that this is an out-of-area call.

	To sum it up:  One-plus dialing is coming to 408; you can start
to use it at any time, but by Christmas it will be required.  From company
phones, dial 9, 1, areacode, number, or 9, number-within-408.

Subj:	Rumors about my untimely demise


	It's true, and it's not exactly right.

	Yes, I accepted another job offer.  However, it's very difficult for
me to just say my goodbyes and leave.  Atari, for it's part, feels the same
way.

	So, although I start the other job next week, I'll be showing up from
time to time to smooth things over and take care of things while Atari hunts
up a replacement for me.  Until my replacement starts (watch MAIL for further
details, but it'll be a while), everything will be the same as before, except
for my hours and the job opening.

	I plan to be in house "usually" on Wednesday of every week, plus
whatever odd hours seem to be called for.  As always, I'll keep up on my
VAXMAIL, and my phone will still be answered (trade secret).  However, I'll be
doing things and getting back to you more often than fixing things on the spot.

	The other job?  It's with a 3-year old company that takes group photos,
has 40 employees and is rapidly expanding (9 last year).  They make a software
product that allows transparent access to databases of several types, even on
other systems.  I'll be leading the team doing the port to VAX/VMS when I get
up to speed.  The name of the company is DB Access, and they're out of Santa
Clara.

	My last day as a full-time employee at Atari is Wednesday, July 3.
Since the transition period will likely simply taper off, I'd like to take
this opportunity to point out that it was a very difficult decision to make.
I've appreciated the opportunity to work here, and thoroughly enjoyed the
company of those I work with.  Compared against a very desirable job was
leaving dozens of good friends...many of whom I hope to keep anyways.  And
this job was pretty good to me, too.  Thank you all for the opportunity
to work with you.

	BUT WAIT!

	Now that I've said it, I feel better.  I simply didn't want it to
go unsaid; now I can gradually fade out as my successor takes over...an event
I'm in no hurry to see.

Subj:	NOT a featured feature (smile)


	By the request of those involved, a couple of extension changes are
in process.

	Susie Hartline, owner of extension 411, and Laishin Su, at 415, have
been getting a lot of calls from people who forget to dial a 9 to get out.
They've been quietly living with it, since they didn't know there was anything
they could do about it.

	They were right; people will forget.  SO, they have new extension
numbers.  Susie is now 481, and Laishin is 485.  The old numbers will still
work for outside calls (that wasn't the problem), and the new numbers will
work from outside for consistency.  The old numbers will work FOR A LITTLE
WHILE LONGER, till everyone gets a chance to read this message.  Then I'll
break them.

	I wanted to make it return an error tone (sending the calls to the
operator just moves the problem), but the best I can do is to make the extension
always busy.  SO, if you dial information, and get a busy, or you dial a
number in 415 and it's busy by the time you finish dialing, consider it a
reminder to dial a 9 first.

	And to stave off the helpful hints:  there aren't any answering machines
"laying around" to record a hint; if there was, somebody would want it for their
phone, anyways.

	You will find the new phone numbers in any phone lists printed
after today...and the FONE command on the VAX.

	I plan to "break" the old numbers about a week from today.

I'll be on vacation until 7/22 and then be out again 7/23-7/25 (I got sucked
into the Nintendo legal quagmire).

You can refer your problem calls to Mike Albaugh (x1709) and/or Jim Petrick
(x1777) and they may be able to figure out what to do about your troubles. Keep
in mind that these guys have expertise and experience in entirely different
areas then what what you might be working in (as do I for that matter). If
you explain to them what it is you do, exactly how you do it and what's not 
working correctly, they will have a better chance of solving your problem.

For printer problems, please call the service organization that is listed on 
the printer and give them the serial number of the printer.

There seems to be two main catagories of MANMAN problems. One is the "stuck" 
terminal problem which is really a lock conflict. This problem is the one 
that happens most (at least of the ones reported to me). Mike or Jim can 
run a procedure to find out who is causing the lock conflict and you can get 
it resolved that way. The other MANMAN problems are failures of the various 
commands to do what they are supposed to. ASK will have to fix those, since 
nobody here knows how to do it.

Good luck, BCNU sometime near August.

Steve and I would like to thank everyone for not only the generous

had many people volunteer personal possessions, along with time and
money.  We can't thank all of you who contributed enough, we only
hope that someday we can repay "you" if you ever have a time of need.

On a lighter side, Steve and I are doing fine.  We took the big 
plunge and couldn't be happier with our decission of love and 
companionship.  We may have gone through a tragedy at the beginning
of our climb (
(The rest of our lives) but maybe this just means the "Seven year

One would think that gardeners would be hungry for business these days, but
apparently not!  I've called several from the yellow pages and they either
don't return my calls or want to charge me $140 per month to come to my
house every other week.  I could understand the latter if I owned four acres,
but I have a track house in Willow Glen.

My neighbor is also looking for a gardening service (they have given up looking
after having several show up once, twice or not at all), so who ever I find
might be able to strike a deal next door as well.  So, if you have any 
referrals for gardening, please forward them on to me.  Thanks!

                                             --Linda

Subj:	IMI EPROM Programmer


Our trusty old IMI EPROM programmer has been limping along with
one socket marked "Bad Verify" - I understand that the socket is
not used.  Should we get it repaired? Do we program enough 27512's
to make it worthwhile? It will cost $400 to repair it.  We can also
"upgrade" it for $1200; this buys us faster programming algorithms 
and faster download (IMI claims 38.4 K on the serial line), but still
NO 32-pin devices. Is the upgrade worthwhile? 
IMI says their 32-pin device gang/set EPROM programmer is coming soon.
I have heard that for about 2 years now.

Opinions, testimonials, complaints, etc. are solicited.
	Is the repair worthwhile @ $400?
	Is the upgrade worthwhile @ $1200?

Subj:	ECLIPSomania


    Did anyone watch the Nightline report on ECLIPSE last night?  I
guess the ECLIPSomania was alot bigger than I thought.  Some even
went as far as stealing others personal property to get a good look
at that solar phenomenon.   
    Speaking of personal property, I think I was too harsh on the
wanna-be astrologer who took my viewing glasses without telling
me.  Wishing blindness on someone with such genuine interest in
the solar ECLIPSE was unreasonable.  After all, much attention went
into safety of those lenses so I wouldn't hurt my eyes, I meant your
eyes.  So it was totally pointless to wish blindness on you.  Thats
why I now wish you a bad case of poison oaks all over your body.
Specially around your eyes. 
    Thankyou Milty for supplying me and many others with backup 
viewing lenses.

Subj:	New version of TEK


I have just put a new version of TEK in utl$exe:.  The new version 
supports printing in black and white on the QMS printer next to Lois 
(LQ0:).  

Why would you want to do such a thing?  Well, grayscale pictures are 
1/3 the data of color pics, so they print about 3 times faster.  Also,
the QMS prints on plain paper, and so is quite a bit cheaper to print on.
The output looks pretty good, especially if you just need to know shapes 
and relative scales of objects.

The black & white mode also works on the Tektronix printer, but you have to 
save the output in a file, then do a "PRINT/QUE=TEK filename.TEK" to 
actually print it.

How do I use this wonder?  Easy, just specify '/BW' on the command line, as
in 'TEK/BW file' or 'TEK/BW' (it will ask you for the filename in this case).
When it asks you 'Print now and delete file?', a 'yes' will print to the QMS,
a 'no' will save a black and white Postscript copy to a file for later.

The other new thing is the '/DEFAULT' switch, which will accept all the 
default answers to the questions without asking you.  This allows you to
get a printout without answering any questions at all.  A 'TEK/DEFAULT X.RAD'
will print X.RAD on the TEK (in color) with no other input from you.  All
cels will be selected by default.  A 'TEK/BW/DEF ZZZ.RAD' will print all cels
from ZZZ.RAD to the QMS printer in grayscale.

Subj:	Featured feature


	Do you know how to tell if a given call is long distance?
If the other end is weak and scratchy???  WRONG!!!

	You shouldn't be able to distinguish long distance calls
from local calls.  The quality of the outside network is supposed to
accommodate calls from all over the world.

	So what does it mean when you get a call like that?  Inferior service,
that's what!

	So what???  What can you do about it??

	Complain, THAT's what.

	When you get a call that is of inferior quality, or you make a call
and the quality is poor, TELL THE PHONE SYSTEM.  Each call includes up to a
dozen different pieces of equipment.  From a single bad connection, nothing
can be done.  But if a record is kept, a pattern will show up.

	On our system, ask the other end to hold briefly.  Flash and then
dial *563 (star, five, six, three).  You will be reconnected immediately.
This WILL NOT help that call, but it will record which pieces of equipment
you were using at the time.  Each night, the VAX polls the ROLM to collect
this and other useful stuff.  If several people complain about calls all going
out on one line, that's an indication that that line is bad.  If it floats
over several lines, it is not line specific (it could be registers, coders,
decoders, line cards, your set, or the similar assortment on the other end).

	Some phones (ETSs mostly) have a BAD LINE button.  Simply press it
and you've done what you can.  The phone guys will take care of the rest.

	Some notes about bad line reporting:  It records the same information
each time during a given call.  Once per call is all that helps, and more than
once supercedes potentially useful information.  Also, it only works during
(not after) outside calls, and not at all during inside calls (don't ask ME 
why).  If you try to use it at a time it isn't expected to be used, it will
produce an error tone.  Flash and dial *1 (star one) to reconnect to your call.

	That's (flash) *563 for bad (outside) line, and (flash) *1 for connect.

Subj:	New sound-call symbol file:  AUDIO.DEF


	In addition to producing various header and equate files that contain
sound call symbols (AUDIO.H, AUDIO.ASM, AUDIO.OL, AUDIOE.H and AUDIOE.ASM) we
are now producing a generic file called:  AUDIO.DEF.   This is an attempt to
give you a symbol file that is generic enough for you to use in any imaginable
scenario.

This file is in the format:

 SOUNDCALL S_ABORT,102
 SOUNDCALL S_ADDCOINS,103

    ...etc...

	For your convenience, Mike Albaugh has created a number of files that
contain macros to aid in the massaging of AUDIO.DEF files. They live in 
EE$USERDISK:[68K_US.AUDIO] and are:

AUDEH_PP.MAC	To produce audioe.h, by doing:
	MACPP /out=audioe.h audeh_pp.mac

AUD_H_PP.MAC	To produce audio.h, by doing:
	MACPP /out=audio.h aud_h_pp.mac

AUDIO.ASM	To create audio.ol, assembled by ASM68 (or other MOTOROLA
	assembler)

AUDIO.MAC	To create audio.ol, assembled by MAC68K:
	MAC68K /NOBIN AUDIO.MAC

	Those who prefer binary object files can leave off the /NOBIN and get
	an audio.ob file.

AUDIOE.ASM	for inclusion in ASM68 assemblies, to "XREF" the symbols
	(for those who _do_ link to audio.ol or audio.ob)

AUDIOE.MAC	for inclusion in ASM68 assemblies, to "XREF" the symbols
	(for those who _do_ link to audio.ol or audio.ob)

AUD_SYM.ASM	for inclusion in ASM68 assemblies, to simply define the
	symbols (for those who do _not_ link to audio.ol, but re-assemble)

AUD_SYM.MAC	for inclusion in MAC68K assemblies, to simply define the
	symbols (for those who do _not_ link to audio.ol, but re-assemble)

	All these files "include audio.def", which may or may not be
what you want. On the one hand it makes the assembly command simpler,
which is a real plus for those using archaic command files that choke
on anything more complex than a single file name. On the other hand, some
MOTOROLA assemblers may choke if an "include" file also does an "include".
On yet another hand, none of these files are very big, so they could just
be snarfed and pasted...

	If you have comments to this approach please don't hesitate to contact
us.  Your suggestions might (and probably will) help the rest.

Subj:	Gremlins in Milpitas Golfland


Rick and Jed --

Bonnie has reports that at 4:00pm the game in Milpitas Golfland 
has a problem. When they power the game off and on, the problem 
goes away. The problem is that the player pedals, but he does 
not travel down the road. Bonnie has never seen this, but 
suspects that she is not reading the opto for some reason.

What I'm wondering is if the opto is read through an I/O chip 
that requires initializing. If so, maybe the line is noisy and 
the chip is getting glitched. If so, maybe we can initialize 
the chip at the start of each wave.

Also, Bonnie thought there might be a way to monitor the line 
voltage with the Multisync hardware. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

John

1. The only problem I can think of relates to the use of the new OptoCoupler
Pot. When this pot is used, Resistors R182, R183, and R184 mut be removed.
(They do not appear on the production parts list.)

2. In the Driver, one of the 8 bit A/D inputs was connected to a half wave,
unfiltered sample from one of the transformer secondaries. In Self-Test I
calculated RMS by appropriate MultiPlies and Square Root routines.

The routines were never installed in a MultiSync and would take time to
convert. The harness and power supply board would have to be modified to
provide this additional signal.

The following is a description of the Opto Reader:

   
Optocoupler Decoding Means
--------------------------
The quadrature outputs of the Optocoupler are latched at 8 MHz in 185U. 
These latched outputs (NEWQ0 and NEWQ1) are once again latched at 8 MHz to 
provide a delayed version of the signals (OLDQ0 and OLDQ1).

The reason for creating delayed versions of the signals is to permit the
detection of signal edges by PROM 195U.

The PROM determines whether a counter should be clocked, and if so, in
what direction.

The Latch/PROM do not constitute a state machine since there is no feedback
from the PROM.

If an illegal state is produced, the PROM will not clock the counter.

One 8 MHz clock after Q0 and Q1 from the OptoCoupler produce a valid sequence
the circuit will operate. It cannot get hung up.

Thanks for your reply. We'll scrap the idea for monitoring the power.
Instead, we will ask Minh to verify the resistors are removed and check
the appropriate voltages with a DVM.
Thanks!!

Minh --

We need to try to find out why the game does not work right 
sometimes. The symptoms are that at 4:00 you pedal but don't go 
anywhere. When the power is turned off and on, everything is ok 
again. Bonnie thinks it has to do with the opto sensor. Or 
could it be the brakes are on?

Anyway, Jed suggested we check that R182, R183, R184 are 
removed. Could you also check the line voltage while the game 
is operating? Maybe there is not enough capacity for this game. 
You could also check to see if 5V is 5V.

Let me know if this is a problem or if you have other ideas.

Thanks!!

John

Join me in congratulating Mark Stephen Pierce as he is promoted to the position
of Game Design Supervisor!  

We are forming a new Service/Support Department: The Game Design Group. We will
publish a formal written plan for the department within a week or so. Just
briefly, the desire is to formally recognize the need and value of game
designers and to provide a way to nurture and develop game design as a
discipline in itself.  Traditionally, the Project Leader/programmer has served
as the game designer on a project. This is well and good and we expect that to
continue. In fact the Project Leader will continue to have the game design
responsibility as well as the authority to delegate the responsibility.  On
some projects, project leaders have solicited help with game design. They have
had no place to turn, but instead have drawn on the talents of interested
people who volunteer to do game design on top of their official duties as
animator or mechanical engineer for instance. Without a formal department to
service the need, our approach has been ad hoc. The Game Design Group is being
established to address the need. 

As an adjunct responsibility, the Game Design Group will also supervise our
playtester staff. Our playtesters will serve as one source of future game 
designers. We will use other sources as well.  We will be starting small
and growing to as many as 3 game designers and 3 playtesters in a couple
of years.

Mark will be reporting to me.  He will be moving to the hardwall office
next to Ed Rotberg.

I am very excited about this new direction. Rich, John and I have discussed
the need for quite some time. I formally proposed the formation of the new 
group in January, 1991, and I was very pleased that Mark stepped forward to
take on the challenge.

Subj:	OPTICAL ENCODER USES


 I HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED THE TASK OF DESIGNING THE NEXT GENERATION "TESTER"
FOR THE OPTICAL ROTARY ENCODER (THE LITTLE GUY ,ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR 5K 
POT ).
 "I NEED INPUT"..HOW IS THIS ENCODER ENVISIONED BEING USED ?
I MEAN ,IN TERMS OF RESOLUTION.....HOW FAST WILL IT SPIN...?
THE OUTPUT RATE IS 128 PULSES/REVOLUTION PER CHANNEL (2 CHANNELS
IN QUADRATURE 90 DEGREES APART )
"BADLANDS STEERING" WAS 1:1 WITH A 58 PULSES/REVOLUTION RATE.
"WHIRLY-GIG          IS 1:1 WITH A 72   "        "        "
"RACE DRIVIN (COMPACT)" 1:1 WITH A 72   "        "        "
"ROADBLASTERS"      WAS GEARED 1:4 WITH A 36 P/R RATE....BUT THEN
                    THE STEERING WAS RESTRICTED TO 1/2 TURN,SO A
                    TOTAL OF 72 PULSES WOULD BE "SEEN" FROM
                    LOCK TO LOCK OF THE STEERING CONTROL.
....SOOO,LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD,...HOW MUCH "RESOLUTION" COULD WE
USE ,...
"GUMBALL RALLY" HAD AN ENCODER ON EACH MOTOR WHICH COULD SPIN AS FAST
AS 3600 RPM WITH 24 PULSES/ROTATION (1440 PULSES/SEC )...TO DO THE 
SAME JOB THIS NEW ENCODER WOULD NEED TO SPIN AT 675 RPM.
 IS THIS A TYPICAL APPLICATION ????
I UNDERSTAND LETA GETS INVOLVED IN THE CIRCUIT,...RUSTY,WHAT LIMITATIONS
MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED? IS IT JUST PROCESSOR SPEED LIMITED?

IS THERE ANY REASON TO PURSUE 1,000 PULSES / MILLISECOND ?

Subj:	PREFERRED PARTS REPORT - On-Line


Introducing the Atari Games PREFERRED PARTS REPORT, a guide for helping you
chose which components you should use on new designs.  The report will be 
published in hard-copy periodically, but you can search an up-to-date copy 
that is compiled each night by adding the following to your LOGIN.COM:

Add:           $PREFERRED :==SEARCH ATARI$AVL:PREFERRED.LIS

Then after your next login (or $RESTART), you can search by Atari part number, 
generic number, or description.  All you have to do is type: 

                              PREFERRED item

where 'item' is the text or number your looking for.  You can search for as many
items as you like at once by separating each item with a comma.  You can display
the entire report by searching for " " (quote-space-quote). 

  examples:            $ PREFERRED eprom
                       $ PREFERRED 6-32,8-32
                       $ PREFERRED 137001

Upper case/Lower case doesn't matter, and you can use any standard DCL
SEARCH qualifiers including: 

           /HIGHLIGHT=UNDER       will underscore matching text
           /LOG                   will tell you how many matches it found
           /OUTPUT=file-spec      will put the results into a file 
           /MATCH=AND             will only find a record that matches all
                                  the items/numbers that you specify
                                  (ex: PREFERRED/MATCH=AND eprom,128kx8)

If you want a new hard-copy of the report between regular printings, you can
send ATARI$AVL:PREFERRED.LIS to any suitable printer (please note, the report
is 102 columns wide, so it wont fit vertically on an 8-1/2" x 11" sheet).

	Is there a way an operator can abort (turn off self test) the hardware
self test?  Once it starts there appears no way to stop it unless the power

	Are you planning to change self test to use the REAL HELI FLIGHT instead

Subj:	Self-Test


You can leave Self-Test at almost any time by moving the Self-Test switch
back to the Game position. There are exceptions such as during the VRAM
tests. 

If you switch back to the Game during the ROM and RAM tests it takes effect
almost immediately. If you wait until the VRAM test starts you are stuck
until the VRAM test ends. 

Thereafter, I check the Self-Test switch between major tests.

You can enter the Menu, bypassing the Automatic part of Self-Test, by pressing
the Zoom buttom anytime during the initial ROM and RAM tests. (You may have
to hold the button down for a few seconds in order for the switch to be 
recognized.) 

Once you are in the Menu, you can leave Self-Test at any time by moving the 
Self-Test switch back to the Game position. (If you discover Menus that you
cannot leave, let me know.)

The switches used during Self-Test are:

	Thumb Switch
	Trigger Switch
	Zoom Button

If you would like me to change to the Coin Switches, I will, although it will
make it extremely awkward to use.

	I stand corrected.  I tried switching self test during the GSP test and
I did not see any effect for awhile, so I assumed it would wait until all tests
were done.  My mistake.

	I realize now that the coin switches are used by us in our portion of
self test, so I will ask Ed Rotberg to change to use the Real Flight button.

Interested in FPGAs. Read on.

Marshell inc. distributors and TI are coming in this Wednesday at 
12.00 noon to demo TI FPGAs and software. They will probably bring 
munchies, (Pizza or sandwiches). If you are interested, please reply 
today so that I can give them an estimate of numbers. 


I will be trying to get other FPGA vendors in over the next month or 
two to demo their products. I can probably get them to leave me demo 
software for a while also. In most cases the software uses Viewlogic 
schematic capture as a front end.
The primary companies that I am interested in at this time are :
ACTEL 		Antifuse based gates
ALTERA		Eprom based
AMD		
GEC PLESSY	RAM based gates.
INTEL		Second Source for ALTERA parts
PLUS LOGIC	
TI		Second source for Actel parts.
XILINX		RAM based logic blocks

If you have a particular interest in any one of these, or others 
please let me know.
I plan on buying software to handle at least one of these FPGA products.

Subj:	abel4 vms


I have some good news, some bad news and some good news.

The good news: Abel4 is up on the VAX (it has been for a couple of 
weeks now). It has several nice new features if you are into that 
sort of thing.

The bad news: There are bugs in abel4 on the VAX.

The good news: I am documenting the bugs do that you don't have to 
waste time finding them. 

The two I know about at this time are:
Arguments in a MODULE statement. : If you try using an argument list, 
you get a strange undocumented error in your pin statements.
Solution: if it hurts when you do it, then don't do it. DATA I/O do 
not expect to fix this until the next release of the VAX software. I 
wouldn't hold my breath for that. I wouldn't be surprised if they 
phased out the VAX version. If you must have different compilation 
options controlled outside the file then you can play games with 
include files.

The cascading negation in pin statements : If you have multiple pins 
in a pin statement and you negate one of them e.g. a,!b,c,d pin 1 2 3 4;
the software negates all the pins in the list after the first negation.
I.E the software will treat it as if you have a,!b,!c,!d pin 1 2 3 4;
Solution: Use a seperate pin statement for every pin.

This last bug was hard to find because of the new .doc file format 
and pla file structure. When a .abl file is read in it converts all 
the inputs to active hi and transforms the equations correspondingly. 
The equations in the .doc file reflect this.

	Sorry you think this was such an evil thing.  I'm just trying to 
	make better use of the resources we've got, and save some money in
	the meantime.
>
>1. The animators picture take an enormous amount of time to download. 

	True.  Like any bitmapped image, each pixel must be specified, so
	we're stuck with a minimum of 1 byte/pixel.  For the first cut at
	the QMS TEK program, I used hex characters to represent each byte, so
	we're using 2 bytes/pixel.  I'm currently working on an update that 
	will send the pixels in binary form, which will cut the download
	time in half.  

	Of course, the download time is only part of the problem.  The 
	printer itself requires time to assemble the image.  There is little
	we can do about this, except buy more memory for the printer, or 
	distribute the job load to some of the other printers (there are
	3 QMS printers in this building, LQ0 and IT are hooked to the VAX,
	I'm not sure if the Admin QMS is or not).  We could also buy 
	another printer.

>2. The QMS loses ordinary text files after being put into PostScript mode
>   by the animators jobs.

	This is not normally true.  It happens only under certain circum-
	stances, but when it does happen it usually kills the printer to 
	the point that it must be turned off, then back on.  I believe Dave 
	S. was looking into the cause of this.  

>I have been trying for an hour to get something printed out.

	Welcome to Engineering.  It happens to me all the time.  Ever try
	to debug a printer driver when the printer is always in use?  I now 
	usually print things out at night only.  Perhaps if people didn't
	print out every single mail message they received there'd be more
	time for important jobs.  How many "Flavor of the Day" messages do
	we need to print anyhow? (Sorry, that's just my own pet peeve)

This is indeed a royal pain in the ass.

We have already discussed the need for another QMS for engineering at
the staff meetings, and ordering another one is on my agenda for this week.

BTW: There are 4 QMS printers in the building, all of them are connected
to the VAX (the one you didn't mention is TGLQ0 and is in Tengen's area,
right at the end of the "great hall"). The one in marketing is called
MKT$QMS.

Subj:	ASIC65 for Steel Talons


I received the EPROM from Glenn to program the ASIC65 for Steel Talons.

The checksum is correct but the Version Number is not at the correct
address in the EPROM. (The 68010 program used to program ASICs calculates
the checksum but looks at a specific location in the EPROM for the
Version Number.)

It should be at ROM location $0F; instead it is at ROM location $0D.
If you plug the ROM into the MultiSync Board at location 210T, the Version
data should be $FF30 at address $4001E.

This probably does not affect the Version Number delivered to the game
by an ASIC65 command; however, it loses something valuable, which is 
knowing that the correct part is being programmed.

Hard Drivin' and Road Riot are correct. Please try to figure out why the
Version Number is being put at different locations.

Gentlemen;

	The time to release is upon us.  I will need completed selftest, DSPCOM,
poly graphics, blit graphics, DSIII, GSP, MSP, ASIC and 68000 program before 
Wednesday July 31.  If you cannot make this date then let me know by tomorrow 
and provide a date for completion.  As always the sooner the parts are ready 
the better the testing will be.

	The only way to test all the code to finish as soon as possible.  I 
will only fix bugs beyond that date.

	I believe the DSIII, GSP, MSP, and ASIC are completed.  If this is not
true then let me know ASAP.
						Thanks

Subj:	rev 5.3 dsp partyline stuff


In directory [JEDCOM.PARTY.REV5_3] you'll find the newest stuff:
  in particular PARTY.DSP  DEFINES.DSI   OCTOPUS.DSI     PBOOT.MOT (the rom)
.. this incorporates Jed's new stuff as far as I can tell.
  You can also get the new stuff from /REV53 on my toadPC if you prefer...

I don't know how to exercise the new features of Jed's roms; i looked at the
DSPLINK tests and tried them a bit.  The DSPLINK's can send and receive data
EXCEPT!!! they don't return when full if you select 
  "DUMP RECEIVE BUFFER WHEN FULL"  -- maybe that routine didn't get changed
when the polarity of the GINT bit switched???

I need to get your new code so I can add it to my new code and checksum it.

'DUMP RECEIVE BUFFER WHEN FULL' might not work if you are using a Rev A
MultiSync Board because of the interrupt line contention with the SCUM IC.
Rev B boards don't have this problem.

I only have one setup so it is difficult for me to test things like that.

Jed;

	I seem to have a hardware problem with the 8 bit ADC.  I have an 
intermitent problem with the pot reading moving without any change in the pot.
I have experienced this with the PCB on Rotberg's bench and I have recieved
reports of it occuring on field test and on my bench.

	I have a scope hooked up to the pot output and to the input on the ADC.
The value on the ADC input will change when the pot value doesn't.  The ADC will
slowly move until it snaps back to the correct reading.

	Could you give us some help here?

Subj:	A/D Problem


Although I have not been able to duplicate the problem I believe it is due
to the unused A/D inputs floating.

In this regard, Input 6 may be the worst because, having been used only 
internaly to read the output of the Strain Gage Brake Amplifier, it has no 
bypass capacitors whose leakage can keep the A/D's input reasonably biased.
It does, however, have a very nice resistor to ground which, unfortunately, 
was not loaded.

Plan A: Load R193 (1K, on Sheet 16)

Plan B: Load R193 (1K, on Sheet 16);
	Replace C5, C6, C7, C8, and C14 with 100K 1/8W Resistors (110027-104)


I have added R193 to Rotberg's board so we can get a headstart in deciding
which solution to use.

We are under severe time constraints because Manufacturing is scheduled to
start building the boards this week.

If we choose Plan B we will need Meyette's blessing because these capacitors
may affect FCC.

Also: I need a SLOOP to verify Self-Test (and the SLOOP).

Also: I have done the Board Test Procedure for Manufacturing. Copies are 
available upon request.


Regards,

Jed

	SLOOP should come today.  Glenn was handling field tests all Friday.

	I managed to get a failure on Rotberg's PCB.  I noticed that input 6
(counting 0 to 7) was below 0, the same as input 1 on the ADC!!!!  Moving the
pot just a little brought the value to 20H, where it should have been.

	Could I have a copy of the board test procedure?  Glenn needs one too.

	The CONNECT function is how you talk to a party you have on HOLD.

	There are several ways for someone to wind up on HOLD.  That's 
complicated.  How to talk to them?  That's simple.

	You have someone on HOLD if you get a higher pitched dial tone than
you're used to.  You have had someone placed on HOLD if you hear a soft beep
during a conversation.  And you can put someone on HOLD.

	How to UNHOLD?  That's CONNECT.  If you have a button marked CONNECT
or CNCT, push it.  If you don't, do a FLASH if appropriate, and dial * 1.

	That's FLASH, STAR, ONE.  Hurry, your parties are standing by!

the ADC of Rotberg's PCB and hope that it was a bad part.  I'll try to get
the other failing PCB in from the field today.

Subj:	Missing ZAX stuff


There were (2) ZAX 68020 Emulators brand new in the box in the SPACE LAB.
Hubberstey took one. That setup looks fine.
But the setup left in thr SPACE lab has been "raided"
	- all software is missing (ZAX low-level ICE & Mictotec XRAY s/w)
	   (but the raider did leave a ZAX floppy disk sleeve and an empty box)
	- The XRAY manual is missing
	- It appears some PCB's from inside one of the boxes are missing?!

If you know the whereabouts of this stuff, please VAX mail me a message AND
leave a note on the remaining boxes in the lab

As a general practice, It is courteous to leave a note when you take 
something - even if you think it's just for a moment.

Subj:	Plan B

I have done the mods for Plan B on Rotberg's board. I have written up a
deviation and brought it to Manufacturing. I will ECN the Parts List.

I have noticed two things:
  1. The power supply connected to Rotberg's system is flakey and generally
     refuses to start after it is switched off.

  2. The MultiSync Board is lying flat on the table without standoffs
     so that whatever dirt and crud happens to have been incorporated
     into the surface of said table gets to contribute to leakage paths
     to high impedance inputs.

Subj:	RE: T-bills


You can buy Treasury Bills from a Broker and pay a fee or you can buy
them directly from the Federal Reserve and pay no fee.

You can set up a Treasury Direct Account before you buy anything or you
can set it up with your first purchase.

Treasury Bills are by definition one year or less. Notes are 1 - 5 years
(I think) and Bonds are even longer.

If you buy a Treasury Bill, you must pay for it with Certified Check or
Money Order. No personal checks. Notes and Bonds can be paid for by personal
check.

The way they pay you is by Electronic Funds Transfer to your bank account.
You simply provide them with your bank's routing number (it is on your check)
and your account number (it can be checking or savings).

Treasury Bill are sold at a discount. You buy a Bill for $10,000 they
Treasury Bill are sold at a discount. If you buy a Bill for $10,000 they
send you the 'interest'. It isn't exactly interest because you don't pay tax
on it until the year in which it comes due. If you buy a six month Bill today
you get the interest now but it is considered 1992 income. The interest rates
are understated because they don't take into account the fact that you can
have the'interest' now and can invest it for additional yield.

Treasury obligations are NOT TAXED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

You can set up a Treasury Direct Account and buy Treasury obligations from
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. You can call 415-882-9798 for
a general announcement, 415-974-2330 to talk to a person, or 415-974-2629
which is an answering machine where you can order forms. You can call it and
say "Please send me the forms and information for setting up a Treasury Direct
Account and buying six month Treasury Bills." And they will.

Subj:	Bug in rand()


	I have discovered a potentially disasterous bug in
the random number generator we use in our games. The problem
lies in the line:

	    return( (((ulong) in << 15) + lfrac) >> 16);

which should just be:

	    return lfrac >> 16;

Apparently the extra factor of in was added in an attempt to force rand()
to return numbers from 0 to in _inclusive_. Without this factor, rand()
should return a uniform distribution from 0 (inclusive) to in (exclusive).
With the added factor, rand() may actually return numbers LARGER than in!

	By the time you read this, an updated copy of rand.asm for the 68K
will be in EE$USERDISK:[68K_US].

			We now return you to your regular programming

			STEEL TALONS SAIIS AUDIO BOARD PCB TEST 
				G.F.M. 8/7/91

(1) SELF-TEST
	A. Apply power to the SAIIS audio pcb.
	B. Verify that the following leds are lit:
	   CR10 (-14V), CR11 (+14V), and CR4 (+5V). If one of these leds isn't
	   lit then reject the board.
	C. Slide the self-test switch to enter self-test and press ZOOM to
           bypass the 2 minute automated test.
	D. Select SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
	E. Select SOUND BOARD TESTS.
	F. Select SA SELF TEST. If there is an error during this test then there
	   may be a problem with one of the following:
	   ROM at 1F,
	   Decode Gal at 2L,
	   6502 at 1D,
	   SCOM chip at 1L.
	   If there are no errors after this scom communication test then you 
	   will hear 8 tones cycling between the left and right channels 
	   followed by one long tone. These tones check the Yamaha circuitry.
	   After these tones you will hear 3 sentences followed by a sound 
	   effect which come from the ADPCM roms in the following order:
	   ADPCM0 at 1M: "PRETTY GOOD"				  (PGOOD)
	   ADPCM1 at 1N: "THOSE ARE GOVERNMENT PAID FOR KID"	  (GOVTPAID)
	   ADPCM2 at 1P: "THIS IS YOUR FINAL EXAM KID GOOD LUCK"  (EXAM)
	   ADPCM3 Sound of gunfire hitting a Tank.		  (TANKHIT)
	   If one of these sentences do not play then the corresponding rom
	   may have a bent pin or may be bad, or the ADPCM Gal at 2F may be bad.
	   These sounds can be manually played by going to the PLAY SOUNDS 
	   screen and then selecting the names in the parentheses.
	   Exit this test by pressing ZOOM.
	G. Select PLAY SOUNDS
	H. Select R_CLICK and press the thumb switch to check the right coin
	   counter output.
	I. Select L_CLICK and press the thumb switch to check the left coin
	   counter output.

Subj:	Mike Geeks again


	My mail yesterday was based on the (dubious) practice of
stripping the 'C' comments out of the 68000 assembly 'RAND' from
Pit Fighter. In fact, the addition of (in << 15) is not only harmless
in the asm version, it is needed, if the rest of the routine is
left alone. Unfortunately, the "MULS" immediately above the lines
in question makes the "raw" random number have a range [-in/2..in/2),
so the addition (effectively) of in/2 was needed. On the other hand,
changing to a MULU lets you shine on the addition _and_ save some time.

	If all this is just too confusing, just copy the _new_ RAND.ASM
(if you took the old-new one yesterday) and accept my apologies for
any hair-tearing that rand(42) occasionally returning -21 caused.

				Maybe I should go back to pumping gas,
					Mike

	I have had the belief for some time now that (sooner or later) I 
would need to shake up my life.  Two weeks ago I closed on a new house and
on a new job... I achieved "shake up".


	Of course, the decision to leave Atari was very difficult. Any good 
job is tough to leave, but very few places are like Atari. I need to make
clear that my decision to leave is not a statement about Atari. Rather, it
is a statement about my own restlessness.


	To those of you that I have been lucky enough to work with, I want
to say thank-you. It has been an honor and a privilege to work with you.

Subj:	DSPCOM Checksum


The 2105 cannot read the Boot ROM directly, it can only boot pages of
program from it.

The program checksum is done on code that has been booted. This is not the
same as the actual data in the ROM because of things like:
1. The byte at address 003 in the ROM is a count of the words*8 to load.
2. A program memory word is 24 bits. Every fourth byte in the ROM is 
   $FF and is not loaded.

In addition, Peter did not leave enough room in his boot page to add a 
checksum routine, so I did something very clever that lets me overlay code 
from boot page 4. This means that only about 97% of the program code is 
checksummed, but it was either that or nothing.

You are correct, $6420 is the checksum for the ROM. I made the program 
checksum come out to $1025 which is the last part of the part number.

Note: There is a Note on the screen that says:

	NOTE: THE PROGRAM CHECKSUM IS NOT THE ROM CHECKSUM

Since the checksums are correct, and assuming both Self-Test and Peter's code
work, it looks like you can release it.

Subj:	DSPCOM cable test


Jed;

	I got your message.  We are updating the selftest in all three
in house units (counting our station).  I will release the selftest
later today to tomorrow.

	Is it possible to have the cable test for a later release?  If
so, could you provide a date?  Is there some thing you need (besides time)
to complete this test?

Subj:	RE: DSPCOM cable test


Yes, it is possible to have the cable test for a later release. No, I
cannot provide a date. I have one AMS and must make EPROMs to work with
two systems. (The other system is the one used to make ASIC65s, which has
priority.) It is too late to throw equipment at the problem.

If I cannot get it to work today or tomorrow I will probably not be able to
do it since I have several other projects to do things for before I go on
vacation.

Regards,

Jed

We are holding TWO SIMULTANEOUS STEEL TALONS TOURNAMENTS

-----------------------------

1) You MUST register with either myself or Ed Logg by
   6:30 PM this evening (Thursday 8/15).

   and update the ladder yourself.  All matches must be 
   complete by 5:00 PM on Friday 8/16/91.

4) Each match will be a best of 13 round event (i.e. the
   first player to 7 Kills)

5) Third place will be determined by a consolation play-off
   of the semi-finalist losers.

6) It is legal to use the 30MM gun or ANY OTHER MEANS short

    from time to time.  If we catch you, we break the sixer of 
    OUR choice over your head.

4)  The high score on each side will win a sixer of the beverage
    of his choice.

5)  The number 2 player on each side will receive a STEEL TALONS

Subj:	Apple Hi-Res Monochrome 12" Monitor Available


I got a color monitor today, so my Apple Macintosh B&W monitor is now available
for internal company transfer.  It's in very good condition, and is capable of
displaying 256 grays for full gray scale.  It includes the video and power
cables.  It's compatible with the Mac LC and all Mac II-family machines that
have built-in video or a video card installed.

Whenever the next person orders a Mac system, please remember this monitor is
available for inter-department transfer.  It will save the company about $210
(at the developer price).  If you want to see it, it's in the spare office in
Publications.

Subj:	System down times


KIM, GAWD, the Schlage doors and the Ethernet will be down for an hour
or so tomorrow, Saturday 8/17/91 a couple of times during the day. ERNIE
and BERT will be down for most of the day and MIKE will be down the
whole weekend. We'll be installing some new equipment which will require
recabling the power to most of the stuff in the room.

The sequence of events will follow something like this:
Starting about 10am all of the computers will be turned off and
unplugged. KIM, GAWD, the Schlage and the Ethernet will be reconnected
to power temporarily while all the equipment that has to be moved is
moved. ERNIE and BERT will remain down during this period. After all the
moves have been completed (probably pretty late in the evening), KIM,
GAWD, ERNIE, BERT, the Schlage doors and the Ethernet will be
disconnected again and reconnected to their permanent power outlets.
MIKE will remain down the whole weekend.

According to both the schematic and the parts list (both released) the

the pullup resistor on the DUART DTACK line.

Why do you ask?

Rick;

	I have read the Memory Master Release Procedure and I have discussed
this with Rick Meyette.  I am afraid I must agree with manufacturing and Rick
Meyette.  I believe the parts list should show the correct number of parts.
The AROMREL file contains the information on the latest Revision of the program.
Ask Jed to ECN the parts list for the DSIII to show only 2 EPROMs.

	If you still have problems with this, please contact Rick Meyette.

	 You senior engineer/programmers (who rarely burn roms)
	probably have not run into this problem, but the less
	fortunate staff who are blessed with using the DIO (every-
	ones favorite machine) are familiar with this scenario. 

	 DIO claims that the roms are non-blank, you know that you've
	erased them and wonder what's wrong?  Try going out of the
	COMPUTER-CONTROL mode (using up/down keys on DIO) and do a
	BLANK-CHECK, you'll be happy to confirm that your roms are 
	indeed blank.  Now if you resume RS232/COMPUTER-CONTROL mode
	and try to program those parts it'll be a happy camper and
	so will you.

	 Why does the DIO work this way?  Any ideas?

Rick;

	I would like to ask you to have Jed go over to manufacturing today
and to instruct them on what voltages should be used to test the PCBs for
low and high Vcc.  They are currently using 4.9 and 5.1 but I don't think
that is good enough.  Please see Bob Stewart or Jim Freitas.

	We are shipping three games to Japan tomorrow and we need to test
these PCBs as soon as possible.

	I also do not know where they are reading the voltage on their test
fixture.  It could be at the power supply rather than the worst place on the 
PCBs.

	Please let me know what instructions you have given them and the 
results of your visit.

Thank You           Ken w.    3909

Subj:	cat needs home


I'm not happy about it but it looks like I'm going to have to take my cat to 
the SPCA. Our small apartment is just too small for me, my husband our 14
month old daughter and a cat. My daughter is more mobile than she used to be
and it's difficult for all of us when the space is so limited. Minerva, our
cat is very pretty, white tummy and paws, tabby spotted back. She needs a
quiet home like mine was before I got married and had a baby. Being crowded
is getting on her nerves. If anyone has any ideas about other alternatives
besides the SPCA please let me know. I don't think my cat ever learned how
to hunt so I don't want to leave her in a park or somewhere like that.
                  Thanks,   Kris

Subj:	VRAM PROBLEM


Jed,

	I took the board and the new self-test eproms over to Jim and he tried 
them and we found that it still has vram problems with the new self-test eproms.
He exchanged the Multisync board with another one that exhibits the problem more
often for us to look at and I connected it to a bench setup in your lab and I 
can't get it to fail even with the original self-test eproms. Your new self-test
roms are also on the bench.

There are (4) Brief Manuals in circulation (the fat binder style) with
the new PC/486's for the game programming staff.
Rusty has one.
Andy  has one.
Dennis has one.
?????? has one.   If you have the missing manual, please let me know.
		  I think it was last seen in the SPACE lab.

Subj:	You Know What


I would like to find out if there is still a VRAM problem when the
board is powered solely by +5V.

On Jim's test setup, either turn off the appropriate supplies or use a 
pin extractor to remove +15V and -22V from P1.

On a real game with the Problem, unplug the Rump Thump Board.

If you want to wait until I come in, that's fine.

Jed;

	Could you give me an idea of the cost (including overhead, etc.) for
a stand alone DSP audio PCB.  Please assume the host 68010 will NOT be able
to run RPM to drive the DSP.

THE LATEST ON OUR END.
WE PULLED THE SAMSUNG VRAMS OUT OF A MULTISYNC WHICH WAS FAILING
SOCKETS WERE INSTALLED AND JIM LOADED MICRON TECHNOLOGY 150ns PARTS AND
THE BOARD WAS CYCLED ON AND OFF 100 TIMES AND IT WOULD NOT FAIL. THE SAM-
SUNG DEVICES WERE REINSTALLED AND THE BOARD FAILED IMMEDIATELY. IT APPEARS
THAT THE SAMSUNG ARE NOT COMPATIBLE ON SOME BOARDS. 
I SENT A MAIL MSG TO GLEN BUT LATER HEARD HE WILL NOT BE HERE TODAY. I 
HAVE 30 BOARDS IN TECH REPAIR NOW FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND WE NEED HELP 
TO FIND A FIX. OF COURSE WE ONLY HAVE THE SAMSUNG PARTS IN STOCK AND I DO 
NOT KNOW AVAILABILITY OF OTHER MANUFACTURER PARTS. BURNIAS IS CHECKING THAT.
PRESENTLY WE WILL BE INSTALLING SOCKETS IN ALL 16 VRAM LOCATIONS SO IF THE 
DECISION IS MADE TO CHANGE ALL THE PARTS IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER. 
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP US OUT IN THIS DILEMMA?

THANKS     KEN W.   3909

Subj:	RE: You Know What


Jim fixed the board with the sockets and tried the other brand VRAM and could
not get them to fail. If the Samsung VRAM are in they fail quite often. He also
noticed a glitch on the reset line immediately after power-on and is wondering
if this is ok. He gave me a power supply like the one he uses so I can connect 
it to the board in the lab and try to duplicate the problem over here. 
Also Don Wrightnour has initiated a deviation to go to sockets for the VRAM.

Glenn.

GLEN, JIM GOT THE BOARD SET WORKING THIS MORNING AND INSTALLED THE MICRON
TECHNOLOGY VRAMS. HE COULD NOT GET THE BOARD TO FAIL AFTER POWERING UP AND
DOWN APPROXIMATELY 100 TIMES. AFTER REINSTALLIING THE SAMSUNG DEVICES, THE
BOARD FAILED IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE PASS THIS INFO ALONG. WE NEED A FIX FOR 
THIS PROBLEM ASAP. I HAVE ABOUT 30 BOARDS EXHIBITING THIS FAILURE IN MY 
REPAIR AREA AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY BOARDS ARE GOING TO FAIL OUT IN THE 
FIELD.      THANKS     KEN W.   3909

 As you recomended I did the following to fix the GSP TIME-OUT error
that we've been fighting this week:

~ 1_ Power supply reads 5.11 volts on the board.
~ 2_ CR22 & op-amp at 5B have been deleted/removed.
~ 3_ The entire set of E-PROMS have been re-burned using fresh parts off
     the shelf.

Unfortunately, the GSP TIME-OUT error still crashes the program when 
going in/out of operator screen in self-test and in the attract mode
it eventually hangs.

I
'll be eager to try any more suggetions you might think of.  Bonnie and
I are kinda puzzled with this problem and need some help.

Jed;

	I got your previous message but I am starting up a new project and
I want the cost of a PCB to replace the SAIIS PCB.  I cannot use the DSIII
as it stands.  What does just the DSP audio section cost?  How much would it
cost to add a 6502/68000/etc. to run RPM/other driver?

This is what I know so far. I am distributing it so others can comment on it.

The Big Sympton is the GSP Timeout Error.

This is definitely caused by the GSP program crashing.

The GSP program crashes because, after powerup, one or more of the VRAMs
do not work, and nothing can be done in software to make them work. (The
GSP Simple Memory Test identifies the miscreant VRAMs.)

If power is removed and reapplied, sometimes it will work and sometimes it
won't.

I do not know of anything that will cause a VRAM to permanently not work
in a circuit until power is removed and reapplied, except for Latch-Up.
(This is when the voltage on an input is greater than the IC's VCC. This
triggers an SCR that is part of the gate structure but is not a problem as
long as the input does not get higher than the IC's operating voltage.)

Things that have been tried:

  1. I made Steel Talons Self-Test ROMs with the GSP Reset time extended 
     to 2 ms. Made no difference.

  2. I had Jim remove the +15V and -22V from a board at his test station; 
     maybe it was causing the VRAMs to latch up. Made no difference.

  3. As per Ken Williams' memo, when the Samsung VRAMs are replaced with 
     Micron VRAMs, there does not seem to be a problem.

  4. Mary has checked around; only Samsung and Hitachi still make 64Kx4 VRAMs.

  5. Glenn brought a boardset back and we fired it up on a bench with a
     variable supply. 

     When we brought the voltage up slowly it screwed up every time. 

     We kept the supply on and switched it with just wire leads. It didn't 
     screw up. 

     We returned to bringing it up slowly. It had stopped screwing up. A short
     time later the VRAM in one particular position started screwing up every 
     time. 

     If, with the board powered, I remove the VRAM and plug it back in, it 
     will usually work.

     Replacing it with a Micron VRAM fixed it.

     Swapping the Samsung VRAM with another one from a different location 
     seems to fix it, at least temporarily.

  6. We removed the 0.1 uF bypass capacitor associated with one of the VRAMs
     and measured it. It was, indeed, 0.1 uF. We added a 1 uF tantalum 
     capacitor to the area. Made no difference.

  7. I thought that maybe there was a problem with the plated-thru holes to
     +5V and Ground. I measured the resistance between +5V on every VRAM and
     a +5V Testpoint with a low resistance Ohmmeter and they seemed ok. I did
     the same with the VRAM Grounds. I also did it with the Bypass Caps. They
     all seem solidly connected.

The VRAMs are now being put in sockets and I think this is a good idea.

I would like to find out if all the MultiSync Boards are made by the same
vendor. If there are several vendors, is there a correlation between the
Problem and the board vendor?

Subj:	Featured feature


	What is this FLASH nonsense, anyways?

	It's simple.  When you push the buttons, you simply make noise.
IF the phone system is expecting you to make dialing noises, it dials.  IF
it is expecting access codes, it accesses.  IF the noises you make (like
talking, singing, playing the flute, or playing the keypad) get sent to
"the other end", it sends.

	Once you are connected to another phone, the ONLY thing you can
do is hang up.  BUT, if you hang up and quickly pick up again, phone systems
tend to not disconnect (as you may have experienced at home).  This is called
FLASHing the switchhook (the hook that holds the handset and works the switch).

	You FLASH when you need to get the attention of the phone system.  You
can tell if you have its attention, because it generates a tone to let you know.
When you want to transfer a call, you are already connected by definition.  You
need to tell the phone system what to do.  You FLASH to get a dial tone.
FLASH is unneccesary (but doesn't hurt) if you already have a dial tone.

	Now, some people find it difficult to get the timing down, and either
flash for too short or too long a time.  Too short simply doesn't work, but
too long can be disastrous!

	Some Ergonomic Engineer at Rolm realized this and provided a FLASH
button on the phones we use (most of us, anyways).  If you have a flash
button, DON'T USE THE SWITCHOOK.  It has electronics behind it to stay hung
up for long enough to make sure.  It WILL hang up the phone.  Just push the
flash button.  On phones that don't have the button (like wall phones) simply
hang up very breifly--usually pushing the hangup button with your finger is
better than actually hanging up the phone.

	Of course, there are exceptions, and several, at that.  The best general
rule I can give for multibutton phones is:  If it has a flash button, use it.
If it doesn't, it might be an ETS (one of the electronic types we have).  ETSs
never need a flash, and in fact, can't.  If you have feature buttons, they 
should not need to be preceded by a flash (feature buttons are those that
aren't "line" buttons and also arent 0-9, #, or *--the dial pad).  If you
find that you make noise instead of doing what you want, do a FLASH.

	The bottom line is:  FLASH is to get the attention of the phone system.
Performing a FLASH gets you some kind of dial tone, and is needed before any
of the feature codes (watch this space for more details).  ETS sets (only!)
don't have and can't use the FLASH function.  All other sets need a FLASH;
if you have a button marked FLASH, use it; if you don't, momentarily push
the switchook.  Dedicated buttons (buttons marked TRANSFER, for example)
won't need a FLASH beforehand if they are properly programmed; if they aren't
properly programmed, let me know, & I'll fix it.

I have two tickets to a San Diego Padres game (against Cardinals) on
Saturday - Sept. 7 - at 7:00 p.m. in San Diego at Jack Murphy Stadium...
I realize that's kind of far to go for a ball game ... but ... if anyone
is interested, give me a call (x 427)

If someone is interested but unsure as to how they'd get down there, I
also have a confirmed reservation for myself and my husband (not yet paid
for) for a Southwest Airlines flight out of Oakland at 6 pm Friday night,
Sept. 6 -- total round trip cost: $118 -- returning Sunday afternoon around
1 or so.  The problem is, you'd probably have to pretend you're me...
I know, shudder at the thought ...

Accommodations?  I have a reservation (also not yet paid for) at the 
Raddison Hotel -- I have to cancel my plans, but someone else might want
to take advantage of the results of many evenings of hard phone work
making these arrangements ...

Subj:	PCB failures


Rick Moncrief;

	I returned today from vacation to hear there are several problems in
production.  First, the horizon poly on 13 of the 20 or so games had rainbow
colors.  These colors stay even though I rewrite the colors every frame.  The
colors also stay even though the level (the whole color scheme) changes.  This
problem was first noticed yesterday.

	Second, of the 13 games mentioned above, 6 had GSP Timeout Errors.
When I was there, there were at least two other games with GSP Timeout Errors.
All of these PCBs had Hitachi VRAMs.

	For your information, I was told that a "large" percentage of 2101-7 
parts have failed recently.  I was told the numbers are in the 16 to 18 count.  
I was also told that 9 failed yesterday alone (6 with the date code 9121).

	The Hitachi VRAMs just hit final assembly yesterday afternoon.  I 
suspect these parts may have something to do with the problem(s) above.

	I checked the 12 or so games with the Samsung VRAMs with modified PCBs.
They have no GSP Timeouts and I have seen no "rainbow" horizons.  What does the
mod Jed requested do?

	Bob Stewart, Jim Freitas, and I agreed that we would not ship any games
until we have determined more about these failures.  We are currently unboxing
and locating all the games that fail.  We will try replacing the Hitachi parts
with Samsung parts.  Please check with Ken Williams tomorrow to determine the
results of their experiments.

	Bob Stewart, Jim Freitas, and I will not be in tomorrow.  Bob and I can
be reached at the AMOA.

	Could you please call Jed and ask him to come in and help solve this
problem?  I realize he is on vacation but we are in a position where we need
to ship games without failures.

						Thanks

Subj:	A tall TAIL


Announcing an update to the TAIL utility. Now it has a -f option (or /F if you
prefer) which lets you monitor the input file.

TAIL with the -f option, will display the last n lines (defaults to the
pagesize of your terminal) and add new ones as they show up in the input file.
It samples the input file once every 5 seconds to see if anything changed. You
quit out of TAIL in monitor mode by typing a <return> (or some other
terminting character) on you terminal. If you put wildcards on the input
filename and select the monitor mode, then typing a return will cause TAIL to
advance to the next file. After all files have been displayed, then it'll exit.
This feature can be used to do something like TAIL /PAGE where it'll show you
the tail of a file and wait for you to type return to see the next one, etc.

Typing TAIL with no parameters displays a small help screen.

Normally, the job controller updates a batch log file only once every minute
or when it's buffers overflow. You can change that with the DCL command SET
OUTPUT_RATE=time. I've modified the BATCH and AT procedures to output to the
log file once every 5 seconds which will make the BATCH.LOG and ??.LOG files
reflect more timely information when using TAIL -F.

Garbage.  The video game makers have simply stopped using new ideas for games.
There's a near-inexhaustible supply still out there; all we need is some
creative people making the video games, instead of the brain-dead people that
are at all of the manufacturers now.

Problem is, with a new game idea, the makers aren't sure how the marketing will
go.  If they simply do another kill-kill game, it'll sell exactly X amount, so
they can budget accordingly.  Marketing has taken all of the fun out of this
business.

Subj:	TV program on virtual reality


Last night I was watching PrimeTime Live, and they announced next Thursday's
program.  One of the stories they'll be covering then is virtual reality (and
possibly VR games).  The footage they showed looked VERY interesting, with
almost photo-realistic images.  I don't know if that program is a re-run or
not.
                        Thursday, Sept. 19, 10-11 p.m.
                             ABC-TV, ch. 7 and 11

Subj:	ISO 9000 Evening Seminar


The COGSWELL College Center for Manufacturing Education is offering an evening
overview seminar and a two (2) day detail seminar of the ISO 9000 European
Requirements which are expected to begin implementation in 1992.

Both seminars will focus on design, quality, and corporate certifications which
will position those companies, who are striving to compete on a GLOBAL basis,
to conduct business in the European Common Market.  The major thrust of the
seminars will be to understand the impact of the changes the ISO 9000 will
create for American Corporations. A good portion of the impact will be in the
design process using the ISO European relationship to ANSI/ASQC standards.

The evening seminar is scheduled for September 26, 6-8pm  $30.00 per person

The two day seminar is scheduled for October 3 & 4, 8:30am - 5:00pm the cost
is $325.00 per person.

Both seminars are held at the Sunnyvale Hilton Inn, 1250 Lakeside Dr. off US
101 Freeway and Lawrence Expressway.  Phone (408) 973-0309. If you would like
more information you can call me at ext 3923 or pick-up a brochure in front of
the personel offices.

     Thanx....Tom Smith

Subj:	LEGAL HELP NEEDED


As you all may know Steve and I experienced a fire in our rental
unit in mid June.  We have been doing the best we can at collecting
all that is needed to make it a clean sweep in court.

But...  2 weeks ago we confided in a lawyer in Santa Cruz (he was 
recommended by a friend) who said he would take the case - well
his idea of payment (upfront) and our idea of payment (empty pocket-
books) obviously were different.  But of course he had to wait 3 weeks
to tell us the above news.

Needless to say...  We are looking for legal help in the matter.  
Perhaps someone who has a specialty in "insurance claims" or "fire
claims" in general.  We would like to work on a contingency basis;
We think it's possible since we have the fire marshall and his report
on our side.  

We would like to find someone as soon as possible and put this nightmare
behind us, so if anyone has any information that can help us - believe
me it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help.

- Steve & Rhonda Williamson

Subj:	another lost mug


I've misplaced my coffee mug.  It has an unusual design on it, with the
word TENGEN on one side and ATARI GAMES on the other.  It once had something
written on the bottom of it identifying it as mine, but it has since washed
off (I guess those pundits who wrote on the unglazed part are shaking their
heads in an "I told you so" fashion about now).  If anyone has an anonymous
mug sitting around that they know doesn't belong to them, I would appreciate
retrieving it so I may be rescued from paper cup hell.  Thanks.

I just couldn't resist.  I was in the bookstore the other day looking 
at books on DOS 5.0 (don't ask why :{) and I came across the following
rules for using a computer running DOS...

RULE 1: Never turn off the computer when the disk access light is on.

RULE 2: Always turn off the computer when you see a DOS prompt.


I couldn't agree more :{)

Just thought I'd brighten your day...

Hello

	Please join me in welcoming Haywood Beaird to Atari
and more specifically to the Game Design Group.  Haywood will be 
working 20 hours a week as a game tester.  He is finishing 
his education at San Jose State.  He is here to learn the ropes
of the video game craft and hopes in the near future to be a part 
in the creation of games here at Atari.

	He is setting up office in my old office in the Road Riot 
lab and can be reached on the VAX at "BEAIRD". He will be working 
in the afternoons. Stop by and say Hi.

Subj:	3.5" floppy disk drive problems


Mary Sumner's Mac has a SuperDrive (reads up to 1.4 MB floppies) that has been
doing weird things lately -- it often thinks both 800K and 1.4 MB disks are
locked, when the latch is really NOT in that position.  I can put the same
floppy in my Mac's disk drive and it doesn't show up as being locked, so I
don't think it's a crummy out-of-spec disk.

How do these drives work?  Do they have an optical sensor that shines light
through the hole, if the latch is open?  Is there a possibility a lot of dust
is covering up the lens or the sensor is going bad?  Is it really true the
whole disk drive has to be replaced?  The Milpitas Apple dealer said the floppy
disk controller chip is going bad and has to be replaced.  I find it hard to
believe a chip is flaky one day, and works fine for several days afterwards.  I
thought chips die in the first 24-hr. burn-in if they're bad, otherwise last
forever.

If no one around here can help, then I'll ask another Apple dealer for a second
opinion.
            Thanks in advance!       Andrea

Subj:	Cancer Seminars


Ok - another plea from your friendly H.R. department -

I recently put out a memo about free educational seminars offered by the
American Cancer Society.  A number of employees indicated an interest in
the following seminars -

          Skin Cancer
          Men's Health: What You Should Know About Cancer
          Taking Control/Eating Smart
          Prevention in the Workplace
          Women's Health: The Good News About Cancer
          Breast Health Program

Here is the problem - we need a minimum of 15 people for each session in
order for the cancer society to send out a speaker.  No one session has
15 people signed-up, please re-think and let me know if you would be
interested in attending one or more of the sessions.  Sessions will be
brief, about an hour.

If you need more information about any session, please give me a call
at Ext. 3754 or via VAX @ grossman.

Where your health is concerned, an hour of your time is not a big 
investment!

The Expo will fill the building, plus Gutenberg's Garage across the street,
also free for attendees.  The Garage is several hand-on demo areas for
which you have to sign up in advance; each is 2 hours long and lets you see
more details about a system than is possible on a crowded convention floor.

Attend if you can while it's still conveniently close -- the Seybold people
booked fall dates for the next five years in the newly-expanded Moscone Center
in San Francisco.

The exhibitors include Apple, IBM, DEC, Sun, NeXT, software and hardware
companies, including mfrs. of scanners, monitors, laser printers, film
records, imagesetters, multimedia equipment and software, animation packages,
desktop video editing, magazines, books, you name it.  The hours are: Oct. 2nd
and 3rd, 10 am-5 pm; Oct. 4, 10 am-3 pm.

We have completely purged the Hitachi VRAMs and isolated them in the MRB cage.
All of the SAMSUNG VRAMs have been returned to stock and are being used in all
MODIFIED Multi-Sync PCAs. The Hitachi VRAM inventory position is as follows:

NEW  : 3,852  @$3.50 each = $13,482         Good Chance to RTV at cost
USED : 3,239  @$3.50 each = $11,336         Will sell for best price
      ======                =======
TOTAL: 7,091                $24,818   

ORDER: 8,000  @$3.75 each = $30,000         On order with Merrit Non-Cancable
                                            Mary's still working on it.

Exposure: $54,818 will probably recoup 60%-75% of cost through sale, RTV, and
          cancellation charges.

Thanx....Tom

We, the Atari-Survivors Volleyball Team, are looking for a few new players.
We play at the Power B2 level, and generally do very well.  We have made
the play-offs just about every season and have won a few 1st place awards
in the league.

We need some new blood - people who have played before, preferably in a
league level.  We are in dire need of a female (or two) to play either
as a setter or a hitter, and we always need tough male "SPIKERS"!

Needless to say this is a co-ed team and we all have a blast together.
So, if you are interested in some fast-paced exercise and a good time
call me at ext. 3905 or vax me via "ALLEN".  (Just volleyball fun, please!)

This message is directed to all Atari Games and Tengen SMOKERS!

Atari Games has agreed to hire a facilitator through the American Cancer
Society to help those interested employees QUIT smoking.  There are five
one hour sessions which would be held at Atari Games, probably in the
Central Conference Room.  We already have several people signed up for
this program.

If you are a smoker, this is a perfect opportunity to make 1991 the year
to quit.  Please let me know before the end of the day, Friday, September
27 if you would like to join the Smoking Cessation Program.  We are trying
to coordinate this program to be completed on or about November 21 to help
celebrate the GREAT AMERICAN SMOKEOUT!

	A thing to keep in mind:  In September, the East Bay (Fremont North)
will change from area code 415 to 510.  415 will continue to serve the
peninsula.  For the initial part of the change, either area code will work;
then it will kindly tell you, then it will become "permanent" and start
misrouting calls (sending Oakland calls to SF, for example).

	You should be able to tell from the location of the party you're calling
whether or not their area code has changed.

Subj:	Name for our new game network...


We have now received approval to start preliminary work on Atari's multi-player
interactive game network...

However, we cannot use the word "Atari" anywhere in the name for our network.
Also, the initial working name for our network "CyberNet" is also in use by
UniSys for one of their hardware systems, so we can't use that, either.

So, we are in search of a new name.  This would be the name of the network
under which the user mall and all other games on our network would be played.

Any suggestions?

Please send your responses to this E-mail address...  If you submit a name
which we end up using, I will reward you with a 6-pack of your choice of
beverage!
	Thanks,
		Rusty

Subj:	New Game Design Group member.

Hi

	Please join me in welcoming Scott Sava to Atari and more
specifically the Game Design Group.  Scott's new position is Associate
Game Designer. He comes from a background with a strong creative basis
and has worked on comic books and consumer video game projects. He is
an avid game player and has a great desire to get busy on games here
at Atari. 

	He joins the new Game Design Group which consists of myself
and our Playtesters Victor Mercica, and Haywood Beaird.  The addition
of Scott as a Associate Game Designer is an important step in the plan
to develop the Game Design Group into a strong resource from which our
arcade projects will be able to draw creative assistance, ideas, and
direction. 

	If the the name Sava seems familiar to you it's because his
father once worked here. Another "trivia" note is that he was also the
model the animators used for the Paperboy character.  He has taken up
residence in John Moore's old cube in Engineering.  Please stop by
and say hello.

Subj:	Matra-Harris 2Kx8 SRAM moving spec.


Q. How do you maintain high yields on an IC production line.

A. When too many parts fall outside spec., change the spec.


We recently had a production line problem with Matra Harris 2Kx8 35nS 
parts. The cause was Address Hold From End Of Write, specified at 
0nS. We had one part that needed 6nS before it would work. Most parts 
needed 2-3nS.
After checking several data books we found that the 1987 data sheet 
specified 0nS for this parameter, the 1989 data sheet specified 5nS 
for this parameter, and the 1990 data sheet specified 2nS for this 
parameter. Not fair I say. Be forewarned.

Matra were called in and so far have agreed to accept the parts back.
The specification discrepency was not discovered until after they left.
While they were here they claimed that their part was compatible with 
Cypress parts. The Cypress part specifies 0nS for this parameter. 
The also suggested that since we have been using this part for 
several years without problem that this must be just chance error. 
What garbage ! 

I will be recommending disqualifying them for this part, (after they
supply enough good parts go keep production going) and putting them 
on restricted approval as a company for any part.

We all know by now about the devastating firestorm that has raged through the
Oakland and Berkeley hills.  Thousands of people have been left homeless with
no where to turn but to the relief services like the Red Cross and United Way
that have been set up for this purpose.

As we did two years ago after the earthquake, we need to help the victims of
this latest catastrophe.  Here is a partial list of what is needed.  Keep in
mind that it will be a couple of days before these items are delivered, so
don't bring anything that is perishable:

	Eyedrops           Bottled Water       Boxed food
	Blankets           Sodas               Candy
	Pillows            Juices              Soap
    	Sheets             Baby Food
   	Towels             Bread
	Diapers            Canned food (especially meats)

Boxes will be set up in the Cafeteria to collect your donations, or if you
prefer, you can bring them directly to H.R.

Thanks,

Are you a C/W fan?  Do you recognize the name Garth Brooks?  Can you 
yell real loud?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you are invited to join
an already committed group of 15-20 Atarians and friends at the Saddle Rack in 
San Jose tonight at 8:00 pm.

Believe it or not, we have a celebrity amongst us.  Fame and fortune are just
around the corner for our very own Mark Pierce.  A group of us almost got Mark 
to go up to the stage during the AMOA juke box awards in Las Vegas to accept 
an award for Garth Brooks, but he said he didn't have the right hat.  So tonight
Mark will don his Stetson and get up on stage and sing about all of us friends 
he has in low places.

Yep, that's right!  The Saddle Rack is having a Garth Brooks look alike
contest and Mark is a dead ringer!  

Voting is by audience support.  That means we need lots of loud people
screeming and clapping.  So join us if you can (even if you didn't answer
yes to any of the questions above) it'll be fun.

That's 8:00 tonight, Wed. 10/23, The Saddle Rack, 1310 Auzerais (off Meridian
near San Carlos) in San Jose.  No cover charge.  Bring your friends!

Subj:	New font library quick reference sheets are available


I revised and updated the font quick reference yesterday (it's now 3 pages
long).  It shows all the fonts loaded onto the Varityper VT-600 laser printer's
hard disk.

Note that if you print a Mac file on any of the QMS PS-410 printers, the
majority of the fonts on the sheet are NOT in those printers.  For those
unfamiliar with how Mac fonts work, you HAVE to have the downloadable printer
fonts on your computer (usually in the System folder) to print properly at the
QMS printers. If you have a small hard disk, remember that the entire collec-
tion of these printer fonts takes up about 4.25 MB -- and the screen fonts for
them take up additional space.

Copies of the quick reference are available on the round table in the
Publications Dept. common area.  Help yourself.  If you want the printer or
screen fonts, see me.

Subj:	Hey, Big Spender


	Here's a chance you don't get every day. Rather than try
to paraphrase, I'll just quote the letter I got:

--------- cut here for quoted letter --------

Dear Friend & Supporter of
Golden Gate Railroad Museum:

	Here's your chance to win a free 3 day, 2 night weekend trip for two
($1500 value) on a beautifully refurbished 1921 luxury railcar. Be one of eight (*)
pampered guests travelling on the "Los Angeles" (**) a vintage businesscar that once
carried public dignitaries and celebrities throughout California. The Los Angeles
is not just any businesscar. Featuring a full kitchen, dining room, and stateroom,
it offers all of the elegance and comfort of grand lux service. On board an
attendant and private chef will provide you with all amenities reminiscent of
authentic, turn of the century rail travel.

	This great opportunity can be _yours_ this November when the Golden Gate
Railroad Museum (formerly Project 2472) holds its annual raffle to benefit the
continuing restoration and preservation of the museum's vintage railcars.

	On Friday, November 15, 1991 the Los Angeles, as part of an Amtrak train
will leave the Oakland terminal, and arrive in Reno (The Biggest Little City in the
World) where entertainment and excitement abounds. Upon arrival, the _lucky_
_two_ will be chauffeured to the Flamingo Hilton for a fun-filled two-night stay.
Sunday afternoon the Los Angeles will depart for its journey back to Oakland.

	Here's how you and a guest can be the "lucky two" on board for an u
unforgettable journey:

	Just tear off the stubs from your "winning ticket(s)" and send them with
a check for the # of tickets purchased, made payable to the: Golden Gate
Railroad Museum. Ticket donations are only $2.00 a ticket or (12) tickets for
$20.00. If you would like to purchase additioanl tickets, you may do so by
calling the Golden Gate Railroad Museum at (415) 363-2472. Due to the high
demand for tickets, the drawing date has been extended to November 4, 1991.
You need not be present to win, Winners will be notified.

Sincerely,
Michael J. Mangini
Golden Gate Railroad Museum

 * The other 6 seats are being sold directly
** In the event the Los Angeles is not available, the elegant Houston
   businesscar will be substituted.

------------- end of quoted letter -----------

	Okay, so you can get them from the museum, _or_ you can drop by and
I'll sell you one of the tickets they sent me. I'll even be a sport and
send the money and stubs in for you, saving you a stamp. Or, if you don't
trust me, you can mail it in yourself. I don't have enough tickets for the
discount rate, so _real_ big spenders will have to contact the museum directly.

Subj:	(Re)construction costs


In light of what happened in the Oakland hills last weekend, I looked at my
home fire insurance policy again.  Two years ago I was told $85/sq. ft. is the
average price for building from the ground up, with tract-house quality. $75
per sq. ft. was low-end quality of materials, and over $100/sq. ft. was custom-
home quality.

I currently have enough insurance at $85/sq. ft., but would like to change it
if necessary.  Does anyone here have more up-to-date figures, due to getting
recent quotes on home additions from a general contractor?  Any info would
help.  Thanks in advance,

            Andrea

I have a new housekeeper I can recommend, if you're looking for someone to
clean your home.  She really could use additional clients, so I'm trying to
help her.  She works hard, is honest, and charges very reasonable rates.

Her name is Eloisa Figueroa, and she has her own car.  She speaks little
English, but is taking night school classes three times a week.  For informa-
tion, call Doris at (xxx) xxx-xxxx; she will relay messages to Eloisa in
Spanish.  Please consider her if you need someone for house cleaning, even if
just occasionally.

Subj:	approximations for sqrt(x*x+y*y)


	There is a better linear approximation for sqrt(x*x+y*y).  The
classic approximation of max + 3/8min has an error of -2.78 to 6.8%.
Using max + 1/4min + 3/8(min-1/2max)(if positive) the error is between
0 and 3.07%.

	For those of use using growth hardware, the classic approximation
will cause a 100 pixel high object to vary in size by 9 pixels over the
visible range.  The better approximation will reduce the size distortion
to 3 pixels.

Subj:	USENET Video game review in London


	This review came over the USENET
	The main subject is Virtuality vs. Battletech,
	but there is also an interecting paragraph about
	a gambling version of Space Invaders.

From: ofoz@cbnewse.cb.att.com (steven.s.ozdemir)
Subject: Video games in London - an American's perspective
Date: 31 Oct 91 15:09:54 GMT
Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories

After a week long trip in London, I can say those Brits really know
how to make video games!!  And the arcade at the Troc near Picadilli
Circus was just as good as people said it was.  Specifically, the Funland
at the Troc had Virtuality and R360 playing GLOC!!

Virtuality is an simulator game, which is very similar in concept to
Battletech here in Chicago.  However, in my opinion Virtuality is what
Battletech was suppose to be.  The main difference between the two
is that Virtuality does not need a support staff of half a dozen people
(like the Battletech center needs), thus making it more like a video
game that you just walk up to and plunk your quarter (or 2 pounds ~ $4).
Secondly, Virtuality's controls are more intuitive that Battletech's
(a friend of mine, after hearing about Battletech's controls, thought
that only a heavy machine operator would think the Battletech controls
are intuitive).  The main advantage of Virtuality over Battletech is that
the aiming mechanism is a helmet that you place on your head!  Movement
of the helmet (say by turning to the left) causes the scene to shift (to
the left) and the gun sights are at a fixed point on your screen.  Thus
aiming becomes the intuitive act of tracking an object with your eyes,
and the helmet's motion sensors determine where you are looking.  In
addition to these controls are a steering wheel and a gas pedal - again
very intuitive.  My only complaint about Viruality controls was the
firing button is a two position lever - one position for laser and one
position for missiles.  This could have been replaced by two fire buttons.
Battletech and Virtuality are about the same in play, except that Virtuality
put two 3 inch LCD displays in the helmet (covering your eyes) where as
Battletech uses three screens in your pod.

R360-GLOC was essentially a pod (that looked like a gyroscope) that held your 
body.  It was constructed so that the pod could spin in any of the three
directions, x y or z.  I never was any good at GLOC, so I couldn't play it
well.  But I really enjoyed doing barrel rolls with the plane and feeling
the simulated acceleration!!

The last bit of news was a Space Invader's game in the Gatwick Airport!  The
game cost a $1 and would increase a pay back pot every time you reached a
certain score.  At the end of a wave, you could take the pot (which I got
up to $2 with little trouble) or continue and risk everything on the next
wave.  I really enjoyed playing a gabling game that was based on your video
game skill.  One change in the rules was that, if a saucer successfully
went across the screen without being hit then your score would be null.
This made the game alot more playable, since when your score went to null
so did the pay back pot!

Ok, complaint department.  Battletech crashes often and has visible problems
due to not enough processing power.  Virtuality runs flawlessly, like an
arcade game should!  Also after sorting through all the articles, I feel it
is my duty to say that all you shouldn't pick on M Channing as much as you
do!  The poor guy must have to sit at his terminal all day waiting for flaming
articles to come in so that he can immediately respond back and clear his
name (or clear up a minor misunderstanding, or a spelling mistake, or a
rude insinuation, or just plain name calling...).  I must have seen a dozen
articles alone from him over the last two weeks where he was responding to 
someone's teasing!!  Maybe two dozen!!!  So please stop teasing him. 8^)

Subj:	More info on Virtuality and R360


The Virtuality system described in the previous USENET message is
made by a British Company called W Industries.  Yes, they use
a helmet display system. The collective wisdom says that it will
not sell in the US market because:
	a) Putting a public helmet on your head is unsanitary -
	   one commentator likened to putting a dirty bowling shoe
           on your head
	b) The helmet is secured to the cabinet by cables which 
           means it will be ripped off as a neat decoration for
           any teenagers bedroom.

Edison Bros. have recently signed up to be exclusive USA distributors
of the product. So maybe we will see a few in selected locations 
with strong supervision - Theme parks and Mega Arcades. I have a vague
recollection of a price in the $100,000 range.

The R360 is a sphere containing a seat, harness, video display and controls.
It is suspended by a double gimbal allowing full 360 degree pitch and roll.
It costs about $50,000. Sega makes it. It is marketed in the USA at
Theme park trade shows since the price tag is out of the reach of the
typical arcade.

Subj:	Another American's Perspective


Last month while I was in London on vacation, I too spent some time exploring 
the virtual reality games that are in that city.  I found two.  The one that 
seemed to be closest to the virtuality reality ideal was located at the Rock 
Garden (a bar/disco) at Covent Garden.  You put on a helmet, you held a rifle 
in your hand, you could move head and body around, and fire at who-knows-what. 
It was a gas to watch the game being played.  Each player was involved in their
own private war, fighting enemies invisible to all but themselves.  This game 
seemed very popular.  Unfortunately, the lines were just too long and with my 
time constraints I was unable to play it.

The Virtuality game that I did play was at Funland, a large arcade at the 
Trocadero, and it wasn't anything to write home about.  It was a racing game, 
6 units linked together.  Each driver had to put on a helmet which contained 
2 separate monitors (one for each eye).  One arcade employee was needed to 
assist all 6 players with their helmets and getting set up in their vehicles.  
It took me quite awhile to adjust the helmet in order for my brain to process 
the images in STEREO-VISION.  The graphics were polygons, much like HARD-
DRIVIN', and once the race began (even with separate screens for each eye), 
the 3-D effect was no better than its predecessor.  If asked if the STEREO-
VISION effect was worth the extra cost of helmet and time putting it on, I 
would say no.  

The sanitary question that Chris Downend brought up about the helmets didn't 
seem to be much of an issue for me.  The helmets were loosely fitting, made of 
a hard smooth plastic, and tightened down (as in "strapped on") by a screw-like
mechanism which connected to the base of the neck.  Perhaps if I had thought 
about it more, I would have been more squeamish about putting "a dirty bowling 
shoe on my head".  But the helmet didn't smell like a bowling shoe and thus I 
had the false impression of it being clean.  As far as the theft issue is 
concerned, I can't see it as a problem since there would always need to be an 
employee present anyway to assist patrons with the helmets. 

The controls were the least satisfying aspect of the game.  Speed was 
controlled by two buttons located down by the feet.  To speed up, you would 
tap on the right button.  To go faster, you would tap more times on the button.
To stay at the same speed, you would do nothing.  To slow down, you would have 
to tap on the left button.  Why Virtuality didn't go with the more traditional 
accel/brake controls, I have no idea.  The steering wheel was more traditional,
but I don't remember it having any feedback.  HARD-DRIVIN' and most other video
driving games FEEL much more realistic than this supposedly virtually-real game.

Another criticism was that gameplay did not exploit the virtual reality 
capabilities of the equipment.  There was no reason to turn your head and 
frankly I don't think the game program would shift the images in the monitors 
had I done so.  The stereo "headphone-quality" sound however was effective 
with nice car pass-by's and lots of crowd and announcer effects.  But all in 
all, it really seemed like an quite ordinary video game dressed up as high-tech
product.  I am sure the hardware had much more potential.  At 3 pound ($4.50) 
for a 2 minute race, this game from Virtuality was a disappointment.  
Apparently, this racing game was a replacement for the Battletech-type game 
described in Flanagan's original message.  Its too bad they decided to replace 
it.

	How can I remember all these strange CODES???

	It's easy...use the map.

	The MAP?  I don't see no stinkin' MAP!

	It's on your phone.

	Oh.

	Say, how do you use it?

	Glad you asked.  See the areas near each of the keys on the side?
Like near the 1 it says "CONNECT *" and "CAMP-ON #"?  That's to remind you that
CONNECT is * and 1 (that's why it's next to the 1).  Likewise, CAMP-ON is #1.
All the CAMP-ON functions are #1; CANCEL CAMP ON is ##1.  The "normal" codes
all start with # (pound) or * (star), and end in a single digit.  The "undo"
codes are repeats of the pound or star, ending with the same digit.

	On the right side of the phone, it says near the 3 key, "* PICK-UP".
This means PICK-UP is *3, not 3*.  Things starting with digits are assumed to
be phone numbers of some kind:  extensions, trunk access (like paging), outside
calls (actually, the 9 is a special trunk access), and so on.  The function
codes always start with a pound or star.

	Remember that you may need to FLASH before any particular access code!

	It's time for the 1991 United Way Campaign to begin, and 
	you will be hearing about United Way and the 104 health and
	human care agencies and special projects it supports.  Atari
	supports United Way for a number of reasons.

	Perhaps the most compelling reason to support United Way
	is because your gift will touch the lives of many people 
	in our community.  Last year, one out of three county 
	residents used the services of a United Way - supported
	agency -- services such as emergency assistance, vocational
	training for people with disabilities, counseling and educa-
	tion programs for abused children and emotionally disturbed
	children, day care for children and the elderly and much more.

	United Way strives to keep its administrative costs to a 
	minimum.  Through the support of dedicated volunteers, United 
	Way achieves this goal.  Approximately 90 cents of every dollor
	contributed to United Way goes directly to local agencies.  
	Allocation of funds to each agency is decided by volunteers, 
	after a very thorough process of evaluation.

	Through Atari's support of United Way, many people will receive 
	vital health and human care services from agencies throughout 
	Santa Clara County.  Your gift can be given through payroll 
	deduction, a method that lets you offer a generous gift by 
	spreading small payments throughout the year, or by a one time
	donation.  Your contribution is a wise way to show our community
	you care.

Jed;

	I got your request.  I do not understand why you need a Steel Talons
program to test on Multisync II.  It appears that Steel talons will never use
Multisync II.  If you would still like to have a Steel talons version as an
additional test of Multisync II, let me know today.  I found at least two
places where the CONTROL register at C00000B0 is written to.  Is this the
correct address for the GSP 34010?

As per your memo of 7 November 1991, please confirm that Steel Talons will

Finding DRAMs for the MSP is becoming a lot of work. Since Steel Talons is

Subj:	Multi-sync II


Will Multi-sync II be used in Steel Talons?
It's tough to predict the future. Here is some data and some conclusions
on Steel Talons:

1) Recent wisdom from Exec Committee: 
   "Standard Distribution channel  has done all it can; no more orders.
2) We have 175 Steel Talons in inventory.
3) We have 200, possibly 400 Steel Talons PCBs purchased in inventory.
4) We may build some Steel Talons uprights; no testing yet; may begin
    testing as early as 11/18/91.

I feel confident saying we will not build anymore sitdown Steel Talons. I
speculate that as many as 800 Steel Talons uprights may be released for
production in January 1992 (quantity is based on what they did with Road Riot
upright). Since we have an inventory of 200-400 Multi-syncs, it is likely we
will begin such a build with Multi-syncs; then once the ball is rolling that
way, it is likely that Mfg. will want to complete the build with Multi-syncs
and not switch to Multi-sync II. It's hard to ask Mfg. what they would do until
they have a time and quantity for the Upright Talons build and can try to
procure parts for more Multi-syncs. Given the weak state of the market, 
we may end up with a release of Upright Steel Talons that matches our
inventory of Multi-syncs, powersupplies, joysticks etc. In that case, we
would not use multi-sync II  on Upright Steel Talons at all.

In summary, the probability of using Multi-sync II on Steel Talons is small,
maybe 1 in 10. This would go up if Upright Steel Talons tests extremely
well, the market improves and  Mfg. has difficulty procuring Multi-sync parts.

Subj:	RE: Multi-sync II


The reason for doing MultiSync II is that the 64Kx4 VRAMs and 64Kx4 DRAMs
are becoming increasingly difficult (like impossible) to get.

Don't plan on building more MultiSyncs.

This latest flurry of memos got started when I asked Logg for some programming
support so I could verify that one of the new circuits works with Steel Talons.

After my experience with Hitachi VRAMs I see no reason to believe that anything
works unless I see it.

Unless I am otherwise ordered, I am continuing to work on MultiSync II. It will
probably be needed for Street Driver. It will probably be the only hardware
available to the Training Group until they can do their own.

MultiSync II also has the built-in option to use EPROM, Flash EPROM, or RAM 
on-board. This makes possible a very fast download from a PC with a PCLINK
card. 

MultiSync II is not the next generation hardware.

Subj:	Control in GSPCODE

Ed,

I did a cursory examination of the code, and there are 5 modules that
seem to set the CONTROL location.  These are BLITROUT.C, PICBLIT.C,
COL.ASM, GRCMDS.ASM, and DPOLY.ASM.  Ein most cases they either clear
a register and store it to CONTROL, or use the combination of some
#defines/EQUs to store an immediate value.  NONE of these seem to set
the low bit to anything other than zero.

I'm not exactly sure what this means, but I would be loathe to make
changes to these modules bindly.  It looks to me like we need to talk
with Max or find some other solution...

Rick;

	I am going to make the assumption that we may need to use Multisync II.

	I have made the changes in the 68000 code for the new CAS/RAS mode but
there seem to be at least five places according to Ed Rotberg in the Max's GSP
code where he sets this register.  Can you get Max in to make these changes or
should we attempt to change the code ourselves?  If we do the latter, this will
be a case of if it doesn't work, we will be at a loss of how to debug it.  We
have a no tools to debug the 34010 code in the GSP!

I have received EPROMs from Ed Logg that have the GSP produce CAS-Before-RAS
Refresh. 

The game runs but produces pixel errors on some screens. The pixel errors are
different from the ones produced by the Hitachi VRAMs and are on different 
screens.

The error count on a game that was run overnight was Zero in all categories. 

I have measured the signals coming from the GAL and they look very good.
I have tried a bipolar PAL but there was no difference. (PALs have a higher
noise immunity than GALs.)

Freezing the 68010 makes the pixel errors disappear. Since the 68010 tells the
GSP when to change buffers we may be looking at buffers that are out of order.

This board, with the GAL, when loaded with the original program, runs 
perfectly with no pixel errors. This leads me to believe that the problem
is not being caused by the new GAL circuit.

I believe the pixel errors may be due to an error introduced when the Eds were
changing GSP code.

It would be nice to have the GSP Code examined and corrected. If this is not
possible at this time, I will assume the problem is with the GSP code and
will proceed with the board. (I am running out of time to do this board.) 

Also, it turns out that all of the Game Code we have released has the 
GSP generate a refresh cycle every 5 us. It only needs to to produce one 
every 10 us. (Self-Test has it generate refresh every 10 us.)

This is set in the CONTROL Register, bits d3 and d4. They are both currently 
being set to zero, presumably by the instructions setting the other bits in 
the register that control other functions. d3 should be set to '1' and d4 
should be set to '0'. (d0 is LSB.)

Just to pass along some recent developments...

4M EPROM's have reached parity in terms of price/bit with 1M EPROM's.
Pat McCarthy & Mary Burnias have quotes from TI of $14-16 each.
Warrior and Danger Express both plan to use them. I expect that 4M EPROM's
will become a standard part for us in 1992. We will continue to use
1M EPROM's in the program area in 1992, but I expect that usage to 
diminish through out 1992.

4M ROM prices are even better @ $6.00 each in qty ?? I think we can order
a minimum of 1000.  I think Pat amortized mask charges into that. 
See him for the details.

So like people have been bugging me, "How come no movie recommendations

However, I can recommend a movie coming to the small screen on Sunday.
I heard that "Back to the Future, Part III" will be on.

Why that movie? You may ask. Because it stars MY DADDY!

That's right! My father is in three scenes. He's in the opening town shot,
the dance scene, and the big showdown scene. He plays an old geezer prospector.

Subj:	RE: MultiSync II


	I have asked Ed Rotberg to add the 10us refresh rate by changing the
D3 bit to 1.  

	Ed and I do not believe our changes cause the pixel errors we see on
the screen.  Our changes would either kill the GSP/RAM if it failed.  Since
the pixel errors occured on Multisync I with different RAMs, and the GSP has
known bugs, and we did not create or modify any original GSP code, we believe
Applied Research should correct the GSP code.

	It is my opinion that the errors we see are due to a RAM/circuit 
failure.

	Since we have been promised support for the Multisync hardware and
firmware, it seems strange to ask us to examine and correct the GSP code.  We
have been more than cooperative in changing the GSP code for the new RAMs when
it is the responsibility of Applied Research to do so.  We will gladly supply
you with the source code if you wish to do your own examination.

A:  No. Turbo C++ for Windows includes the Windows-hosted IDE,
ObjectWindows, EasyWin, Turbo Debugger for Windows and Resource
Workshop. It reflects an outstanding value at $149.95.

Q:  Does Borland C++ 3.0 have any limitation in the size of files
it can compile?
A:  No.  Borland C++ 3.0 has been completely re-architected to
handle the intensive symbol table requirements of C++.  Borland
C++ 3.0 has compiled the largest PC based C++ applications
available under Windows and DOS today.

Q:  How can I convert my DOS programs to Windows?
A:  Turbo C++ for Windows and Borland C++ 3.0 feature the EasyWin
library that allows DOS applications that use standard input and
output to be run under Windows without changing a single line
code. The result is a fully functioning Windows application.

Q:  Does Borland C++ 3.0 have a Windows hosted IDE?
A:  Yes. Borland C++ 3.0 includes the Windows IDE from Turbo C++
for Windows.  

Q:  Can Turbo C++ for Windows create DOS applications?
A:  No. Turbo C++ for Windows creates Windows applications. Turbo
C++ 2nd edition, and Borland C++ 3.0 support DOS application
development.

Q:  Does Turbo C++ for Windows have full support for resource
editing?
A:   The Resource Workshop is included in Turbo C++ for Windows.
It has full support for editing all Windows resources and
user-defined resources including menus, bitmaps, dialogs, string
tables, accelerators, icons, and dialog controls. It can edit
resources in .exe, .rc, .dlg. .bmp, .ico, and .res files. The
Resource Workshop is easy to use, yet fully featured.

Q:  Does the Windows IDE provide the capability to optimize the
executable it generates for size or speed?
A:  Yes, it includes register and jump optimizations. To take
full advantage of our global optimizing compiler, the character
mode IDE or the command line compiler must be used. 

Q:  What is object-oriented assembler?
A:  The addition of object-oriented data structures gives Turbo
Assembler the power to easily create object-oriented programs
while retaining the speed and flexibility of assembler.

Q:  Why did you add OOP extensions to Turbo Assembler?
A:  Assembly-language programmers have always sought ways to make
their work easier with extensions such as macros and directives.
Object-oriented features allow data structures to be encapsulated
and inherited.  This removes dependencies that hinder
maintenance, saves work, and in general makes assembly-language
programming more effective.

Q:  What is the difference between Borland C++ and the Microsoft
Windows SDK?
A:  Borland C++ is a professional DOS and Windows development
environment. It includes a C and C++ compiler with all the tools
needed to develop a Windows application without purchasing the
Windows SDK. The Microsoft Windows SDK is a supplement to
Microsoft C 6.0, which includes some libraries and tools that are
not available from Borland. These tools are not required for
Windows application development. 

Q:  Does Borland C++ come with the debugging version of Windows?
A:  The debugging version Windows which comes with the MS Windows
SDK is now available through resellers for $195.  Borland does
not include this operating system with Borland C++.

Q:  How will I get Windows 3.1 support?
A:  When Microsoft ships Windows 3.1, Borland will make available
to all of Borland C++ 3.0 and Turbo C++ for Windows 3.0 users, an
upgrade kit that will give them full Windows 3.1 support. No
Windows 3.1 SDK will be required.

Q:  When will Borland C++ support Windows 3.1?
A:  Borland C++ currently supports beta versions of Windows 3.1.
Users beta testing the Windows 3.1 SDK can download the necessary
files for Borland C++ from Compuserve.  Once Windows 3.1 becomes
commercially available, we will make an update available that
provides the necessary files and documentation to support the
development of Windows 3.1 applications.

Q:  Can I compile OS/2 applications with Borland C++?
A:  If you develop applications using ObjectWindows, you will
maintain the highest degree of portability for OS/2.  Borland C++
for OS/2 2.0 will not be available until the third quarter 1992.  

Q:  When will Borland C++ for OS/2 2.0 be available?
A:  Borland C++ for OS/2 2.0 goes to beta in the first quarter of
1992 and will be commercially available in the third quarter. 
Early betas willbe available by year end.

Q:  Is Borland C++ going to support Windows NT?  When?
A:  Yes.  Borland is actively developing 32 bit compiler
technology for Windows NT.  Beta test versions will be available
after Microsoft's broad release of the NT SDK beta.

Q:  Why is Turbo C++ for Windows version number 3.0?
A:  Turbo C++ for Windows uses the same, third generation, 
compiler that is found in the latest version of Borland C++.

Q:  What are the hardware requirements for Borland C++ 3.0?
A:  Borland C++ 3.0 requires a 286 with at least 512K of base
memory and 1 megabyte of extended memory.  A minimum of two (2)
megabytes of extended memory is required for the Windows IDE.

I have received 2 demos from FutureSoft.  The demos are for terminal
emulation under WINDOWS.  FutureSoft offers several emulation packages
called DynaComm which run under, Windows, HP NewWave, OS/2 and the MAC.

The emulation that most would be interested is called: DynaComm Asynchronous
Edition since it emulates VTxxx terminals and supports DEC LAT.

If you would like to run the demo you may stop by my office and pick up
the demo disk.  Literature is included.  These are full working demos except
that some features have been removed (DEC LAT is non-operational on the demo).

Subj:	DRAMs


Mary,

Rick and I have decided to use the 256K x 4 DRAMs (4 per) instead of
the 128K x 8 DRAMs (2 per).

The reason is that the 256K x 4 has several sources so we are less likely 
to get caught in a long leadtime crunch.

I met Janell from Wyle today after having known her over the telephone for
a long time. She is very nice. She has volunteered to get me samples of the
256K x 4 DRAMs from both TI and Micron. I hope that is ok.

We will be using these parts in the DIP package. 
(The TI number is TMS44C256-12N; faster parts are ok)

We will still be using the 128K x 8 VRAMs (TMS48C121-12DZ; faster parts 
are ok.)

Missed you,

  Jed

Subj:	New Programmer's Editor Announcement


FOR RELEASE NOVEMBER 11, 1991

Development Tool for Microsoft Windows Makes Its Debut

(Boston, MA) -- Premia Corporation introduced today the first 
professional quality programmer's editor for Microsoft Windows at 
the Windows International Developers Conference being held in 
Boston this week.

The program, named Codewright, was designed from the ground up to 
operate efficiently in the Windows environment thus avoiding the 
bottlenecks usually encountered in programs that are ported from 
the MSDOS or other environments.  The result is performance that 
is similar to, and in some cases better than, the performance of 
DOS-based editors.  The orientation for windows also makes 
Codewright fit more smoothly into a programmer's way of working by 
eliminating the need to switch to a DOS session in order to edit 
the code files.  Codewright can be controlled using menu 
selections, key commands or a full command line interface.

Codewright is highly configurable and extensible allowing 
programmers to adapt it to their own or their workgroup's 
practices and preferences.  Configurability is provided by means 
of a .INI file, familiar to those who use Windows, that allows 
settings and preferences to be established each time Codewright is 
run.  The .INI file can be read from one of several locations so 
that Codewright can be configured in common for all workgroup 
members, configured differently for different projects, or always 
configured the same way.

Configurability is further enhanced by a mechanism for assigning 
keystrokes to editing functions thus allowing Codewright to be 
configured to operate like an editor that a programmer already 
knows.  Codewright comes with pre-defined keymaps for CUA-
compliant operation as well Brief-compatible operation (Brief is a 
popular programmer's editor for the MSDOS environment).  Modifying 
the supplied keymaps for personal preferences can be done 
interactively or by modifying the source code provided.  Creating 
entirely new keymaps is relatively simple and can be accomplished 
using any Windows-compatible language such as C or Pascal.

Codewright is extensible by means of an Application Programming 
Interface (API) that comprises over 500 functions that can be 
called from user-written procedures.  The procedures can be 
written in any language that supports Windows Dynamic Link Library 
(DLL) calling conventions such as C, Pascal, or FORTRAN to name a 
few.  Source code, written in C, is provided for many of 
Codewright's higher level functions.  This serves as an example of 
how to write extension functions and provides the programmer with 
the ability to modify the operation of such functions if desired.  
Other samples of extension code are provided to illustrate the 
process of augmenting Codewright's functionality.

In addition to the "standard" features that are expected in a 
programmer's editor such as unlimited file and line sizes, 
unlimited undo and redo of changes, automatic indenting, multiple 
file/multiple window editing, Codewright provides capabilities 
that expedite and simplify the programmer's tasks.  These include 
the ability to compile, link and debug the target program without 
ever leaving the editor.  An interface to version control systems 
is included that utilizes project orientation.  This capability is 
invaluable in workgroup environments.  Language-specific support 
such as smart indenting and coding templates are provided for C, 
C++, assembly language, Pascal, and Paradox Application Language.  
The list of standard features also includes a file difference 
analyzer and a hexadecimal viewing and editing mode.

Two advanced features are provided to help programmers more easily 
understand and work with their code.  Selective text display 
greatly facilitates understanding complicated, multi-platform 
programs.  This unique capability allows designated portions of 
the file being edited to be hidden from view.  This allows 
programmers to more easily focus on the sections of code that are 
of current interest.  Codewright comes with the ability to hide 
conditional code often used to adapt a program for multiple 
environments.  However, the text to be hidden is programmable 
allowing programmers to implement their own style of selective 
text display.

The second feature that improves comprehension is Codewright's 
exclusive ChromaCode(tm) technique.  Using this capability, 
designated parts of the file being edited can be automatically 
rendered in user-specified colors for fast detection and 
recognition.  Codewright can be configured to ChromaCode(tm) lines 
that have been inserted or modified.  Furthermore, it can display 
language constructs such as keywords, function declarations or 
comments in a special color.

Taken together, the capabilities of Codewright realize one primary 
benefit for programmers - increased productivity.  According to 
Donald Kinzer, President of Premia, "given the advantages provided 
by Windows' multi-tasking and the capabilities of Codewright, many 
programmers will find it productive to switch to Windows to do 
their development whether or not they are actually developing for 
Windows."  Kinzer added, "[Codewright] has been enthusiastically 
received by beta testers.  They've said that Codewright is the 
editor that the Windows environment has been needing."

Codewright is available immediately direct from Premia at an 
introductory price of $199.00 (regular price $249.00) for a 
single-user license and comes with an unconditional 30 day money 
back guarantee.  Continuing technical support is also included and 
is provided by telephone, fax, Compuserve and private BBS.

Subj:	Video on Nintendo's monopoly


Today at 12:30 in the Tengen Conference Room. We will be showing
a video tape of last Tuesday night's Frontline TV show.

The topic was Japan Inc. It had a large segment on the Nintendo
video game monopoly.

It had starring appearances by such luminaries as Dan Van Elderen and
Rich Frick.

Be there if you want to see it.

Subj:	AMOA Scholarship


Several weeks ago I sent out a mail message announcing AMOA's $1,000
scholarship for deserving students.  I have since found that all 
applications must be submitted to AMOA prior to January 1, 1992.  If
you already picked up an application or are planning to, don't delay.

H.R. is requesting that all applications be returned to us for processing
prior to December 16.

If you know a deserving student who could use financial help for 1992,
don't hesitate, you only have three weeks to complete the necessary
paperwork.  Employees, their families and friends are eligible.

Any questions, or if you need an application, give me a call or a
mail message.

Subj:	KEATerm demo - VT420 emulator


I received another demo by Kea Systems named KEAterm.  It's a VT420
(and under) emulator that uses a variety of communications protocol, including
DECLAT.  Actually this is not really a demo, but the real McCoy.

This emulator is very, very good.  Far better than the VT320 emulation
that comes with Pathworks.  You must have WINDOWS and PCSA 3.0 or Pathworks
4.0 to run KEAterm.

If you would like to install this application on your machine you are most
welcome to.  But, remember that this is a demo and after your evaluation 
you MUST remove the app from your disk.
The installation is not automatic, but it is not difficult either.  I
installed KEAterm and had it running in 5 minutes.  I highlighted the
installation procedures in the manual that accompanies the disk so that
you will not have to fumble around in the manual looking for instructions.

Please stop by and pick the manual and disk if you would like to try it
out.  After installation, please return both the manual and disk for 
others to install it.  You really don't need the manual after installation
as most procedures in KEAterm are self-explanatory and there is Context-
Specific Help available.

The prices are inside the front cover of the manual:
$245 one copy, 2-9 15% discount, 10-? 20% discount.  Site license available.

If you would like to purchase this product maybe we should all get together
and purchase them together for the discount.  Site license starts at 20.

Subj:	Door Decorating Contest


Last Holiday Season, Atari Games/Tengen started yet another tradition,
the Holiday Door Decorating Contest.  Last year's participation was
limited, but those who participated did an exceptionally fine job.
We are hoping that even more will participate in the ATARI GAMES/TENGEN
2ND ANNUAL HOLIDAY DOOR DECORATING CONTEST.

Door decorations (cube wall decorations are a winner also - proved last
year by Design Service's ''winner') can be put up anytime during December.
Judging will be held on Friday, December 20.  Make sure all displays are
ready for judging on Thursday, December 19, since the judges will be asked
to do a preliminary walk-around on that day.

So over the four day Thanksgiving break, start thinking, preparing,
shopping, etc., to create the best Atari Games/Tengen Holiday Door ever!

Subj:	******   FOR SALE  ******

For Sale:

			--  Goldstar CT3051 --
		      -- 14" Analog VGA Monitor 
 		       -- 640x480 resolution --

This monitor is only about 2 months old in near mint condition, with original
box and packing materials. Documentation included.

I was actually quite surprised at the clarity of this monitor.  I used it with
WINDOWS and it worked quite well.  It will work very well with any PC that
has an analog color output.

This would also work quite well for a group or department that checks out PCs
from time to time.  For instance, our group owns a roll around cart with a
VGA monitor and keyboard attached.  It has saved us a lot of time.  We just
roll the cart up to the PC and plug in the monitor and keyboard.

This monitor is also nice for a backup.  For instance, if your monitor breaks
down and you find yourself without a one (it happens! - we've had one in twice
and I know other groups have found themselves in similar predicaments).


How Much?   
				-- $188 --

For a look see, stop by my office or reply to this address.

Subj:	Data I/O 29a / UNISITE


We have received the DATA I/O UNISITE programmer. It is functional in 
the Hardware lab. It should program everything we need to program, 
even the TMS32010 family parts.

Data I/O just announced a trade-in value of $4000 for a 29A when 
purchasing a full featured unisite. (Last month the trade-in value 
was just $1000). Even though we have already placed our order and 
received the goods Data I/O will give us the $4000 trade-in. 

For $1000 trade_in value I wanted to keep the 29A. However, $4000 is 
too much to pass up, especially since there are two of them in the 
company. So, I propose to trade in the DIO 29A behind Cris Drobnys 
office to offset the $20,000 cost of the UNISITE. 

There is still a 29A in customer service if the need arises. (It used 
to belong to Manufacturing before they bought their DIO-2900.)

If you have a different view, speak now.
							Pat.

Subj:	4 Meg EPROMS.


We will be moving to 4 MEG EPROMs as our primary EPROM device 
starting with Warrior. Boards being layed out now will have the
number of sockets reduced, or the graphics address space increased
based on the 4Meg device. These parts are at price parity (or better) 
with 1 Meg parts, and the speeds are faster (80,100,150nS).
We can still use 1 Meg and 2Meg parts in the same sockets.

Since MultisyncII is going through a significant rework in PC design,
I thought that this might be a good time to add 4 Meg compatibility.

Subj:	Out-a-Site Programmer


Regarding your intention to get rid of the Data I/O 29A:

1. Where will the Unisite be located?  Will it be moved to the location now 
   occupied by the 29A?

2. Will it program Bipolar PROMs?

3. Is it connected to the VAX?

4. Are there explicit written instructions for its use?

5. What is its projected usage? Presumably it was purchased in order to 
   program parts that could not be programmed on the 29A. What are these 
   parts and how much of the time do you expect the Unisite will be busy 
   programming these parts and therefore not available to program the parts 
   that would otherwise be programmed on the 29A?

6. The Unisite socket for PLCCs appears to be the same as that used on
   the 2900, which I evaluated. There is something you should know:

     	It doesn't work. 
   
   The first 2900 we had would not read a 320P15 no matter what. Data I/O 
   replaced it with a new unit that would sometimes read it if it was
   jiggled appropriately in its 'socket'. I would not trust it to program
   OTPs.

7. The 2900 had another problem with the 320P15 that may apply to ALL devices
   that you may want to secure. If you attempt to read the 320P15 after the
   Security Bit is set, the unit will refuse to read the device. It will
   inform you that the device is secured and cannot be read out.

   This is bogus. The security is in the device, not the Programmer.

   I have had a few 320P15s in which the Security Bit was set and verified
   but the part could still be read.

   I called Data I/O and informed them of this but they didn't understand why
   this is a problem.

   Does the Unisite do it this way, too?

 8. Rick has asked me to ask you to make sure the Unisite is working 
    completely before you get rid of the 29A.

The UNISITE is working to my satisfaction. It is in your own interest 
to check that devices you program are handled by the programmer. I 
will not do this since I do not know what devices you use. It should 
be able to program any currently manufactured part at least as well 
as the 29A can.

Subj:	Low-priced local source for printers, software, etc.


My sister, a friend, and I went to a Sunnyvale computer dealer this weekend and
found that the mail-order houses listed in the back of MacWeek magazine are not
necessarily the lowest dealers, at least of QMS printers.  We went to M & P
Computers and Communications, 1270 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 111, Sunnyvale (tel.
738-8578).  Their regular price for the QMS PS-410 printer with one toner
cartridge is $1595.  Because they were buying two, the salesman lowered his
price to $1550 each, plus he threw in for free two AppleTalk cables worth $13
each.  The optional 200-sheet letter-size paper tray was an extra $150.

The MacWeek ads I've seen for this printer start at $1645, and continue at
$1699, $1749, and $1795.  I suppose you could find additional MacWeek advertis-
ers who didn't mention that printer specifically, but are QMS dealers, and who
might match that $1595 price.  In either case, M & P has a very extensive
collection of B&W printers, color printers from QMS, Seiko, and Tektronix,
computers (but not Macs), etc.  Their software was very competitively priced,
e.g., QuarkXPress for the Mac was $525 (mail order houses typically bottom out
at $519).

By the way, the QMS PS-410 (of which we have around 10) has three constantly
active interfaces: serial, parallel, and AppleTalk, so it works with virtually
all computers.
                                  FYI,     Andrea

	HELLLLP! Not only has my primary coffee cup sprouted feet and walked
away, but my Backup cup is now also languishing somewhere, not sure of ever

Primary cup:	Large (almost a bowl) dark-blue-ish hand-thrown ceramic
	cup with light brown feet (even toes) very distinctive and hard
	to miss, so why is it missing? Got lost in the panic yesterday.

backup cup:	A mug, but not as large as the primary one. Relatively
	ordinary white manufactured cup with "green-line" design to look
	like computer paper with printout.

Becky Depew graciously offered to deliver the

Subj:	Multisync II


Bottom line: 11 boards.

Background: Jed asked me how many rev. 1 Multisync II's we need 
for the police trainers. They may take a long time to get here 
because mfg. won't be here to send them out for surface 
mounting or to wave solder them. Jed will give us one working 
board, and it is up to us to get more stuffed and tested. 11 
will give us enough for two 5-monitor units plus one spare.

At this moment, we are planning to use MSII for all 5 
positions. It is yet to be determined if the center monitor can 
be MSII or not. The sooner we find this out, the better. If we 
cannot use MSII, the Main board will have to be re-layed out 
for available VRAMs and the new memory scheme for the program. 
This has not been scheduled into anyone's plans.

Subj:	Featured feature


	Have you ever started a phone conversation and KNOWN that the other
party was not having a good day, just by how they spoke?  That's called
emotional leakage.  Everyone is prone to it.

	If you're having a bad time, let the phone ring a little longer
while you count to ten or recite your mantra or do whatever it is you
do to calm down and change gears.  Your caller may never know, but if
they did, that's the path they would want to take anyways.

	Sometimes you'll connect with someone who is "leaking."  Perhaps
they just spilled coffee on their desk or clothes, or they're calling with
a problem--their computer just dumped an hour's work.  Realise that they
are angry or frustrated with their situation, and not with you.  Simply
knowing that you are not the target makes the storm easier to weather.
DO try not to get swept up, even if you are the target of someone's anger,
temporarily or otherwise.

	And remember:  Smile.

Subj:	RE: Link kit parts


 As luck would have it, one of only two LINK boards didn't work when I 
tested them!  But thanks to Jed's excellent communication test software,
and his help, I managed to fix it.

 Jed, the 75ALS195 was indeed ZAPPED!

Both board sets are tested and set-up, packed in static-sensitive bags 
, we couldn't come up with the production type interconnect harness due
to some problems with production.  So I've made-up a make shift harness
that'll do the job.  Rick Mcdowell is going to request them to return 
the link kit for a production version when it becomes available.

	There's a Bronco-type vehicle on McCarthy using radar; probably doing a

Subj:	Holiday Food Drive


Starting today and continuing through December 16, Atari will be
sponsoring a holiday food drive in conjunction with Second Harvest
Food Bank.  Second Harvest is dedicated to providing food and supportive
nutritional services to thousands of people in need in Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties.  Children, the elderly, the disabled and the many
unemployed comprise the majority of those receiving emergency food
assistance in our area.  Second Harvest channels donations through
hundreds of non-profit agencies, shelters and churches.  By involving
the community, Second Harvest strives to alleviate hunger.

In the true Atari spirit of generosity, we have set a company wide goal
of filling four barrels by December 16th (approximately 1,000 pounds) and
in addition, Atari management has agreed to match our food drive effort
with a $1,000 donation.  Let's all "fill the barrel and feel the joy"
this holiday season and share the abundance we have with others who are
not as fortunate.

You can deposit you non-perishable donation in one of the barrels 
located in the cafeteria (if you want some ideas on the types of foods
that are especially needed there will be a list posted at the coffee
stations).

I am looking for a 68000 analyzer - something that can passively clip
onto a 68000 and give us trace, and most impoortantly, do performance
analysis in terms of measuring the execution time of a specified code segment.

I you have any leads, or even a vague recollection, please let me know.

	I forgot to mention that this game is to be sold to employees only.  
Vendors and operators are not allowed to bid on these games.  Furthermore, 
the game cannot be used to collect money in any manner.  Violation of this 
rule will result in severe disciplinary action as well as the loss of this
benefit to others in the future.

	I have also been informed that the minimum bid is $500.  (Although
I doubt that this unit would be sold for under $500).

How would you like to play TV?  That is, compete along with others on game
shows such as Jeopardy, or even call the plays during the Super Bowl?  You 
can even win prizes...all from the comfort of your living room.

This handy little unit receives information by FM radio signal.  There are
no cables or wires to hook it to your TV.  There is no need for you to own
a personal computer or game system.  So, does it sound interesting?

Well, you can buy a control unit now and save $50 or wait until they are 
offered at Circuit City in March.  You can even sign up for a no-risk lease 
of a unit for a trial period.  Of course you have to know somebody to get
in on the ground floor of such a deal, and it just so happens that I do...

...but you don't even need to talk to me.  You can call Rich Adam direct
at Interactive Network (xxx)xxx-xxxx and get the full sales pitch, I mean,
more details.

Road Riot 4WD will be featured on this weekend's GamePro television show.
The program airs bright and early on Saturday morning (6:30) on channel 7 
and is repeated again at 7:00 am on Sunday.

Although I have not seen a preview of the show, the program should feature

of Steel Talons and several other Atari games in the background of the set.

Special thanks goes out to our Customer Service group for arranging 
transportation of the games for filming in Sacramento.

So, set your VCR's to record GamePro this weekend:

Saturday, 12/7, 6:30 am on channel 7

Subj:	Open Enrollment


Attention all Atarians and Tengenites - the 1991 Medical and Dental
Insurance Open Enrollment Period is about to expire  ---

All changes to your health insurance coverage for 1992 must be received
by Human Resources before the end of this Friday, December 13.  If you
don't act now, the only changes that can be made to your insurance coverage
until December '92 are the birth of a child, or if your dependent(s) lose
coverage, you may add them (within 30 days of the event) or you can drop
dependents at any time.

But, if you wish to change carriers or just add a dependent, now is the 
only opportunity until next year at this same time.

Don't delay - OPEN ENROLLMENT is about to expire - 2 days and counting!

Subj:	Creation of WorkView symbols


John and I have just gone through our standard library and tagged the PINTYPE
attributes that need to be changed for the Logic Design Rule Checker (LDRC) to
work. Once we have PCB make these changes it should be possible to get 
meaningfull DRC reports from WorkView.

In order for us not to have to repeat this exercise, I would ask that when you
define a new symbol you make sure that the PINTYPE attributes are set properly.
The choices are:
IN	input-only pin
OUT	always enabled output pin
OEM	open emitter/source output pin
OCL	open collector/drain output pin
BI	bi-directional I/O pin. This must be used for bidirectional data busses
	  if the LDRC is to work properly
TRI	tristate output pin. Use only for tristate outputs, not for I/O pins
ANALOG	any analog component pin or other pin you don't want to hear about
	  (like connectors)

If you don't specify the pin types, Leon will make a (usually incorrect)
guess as to what they are so please remember to specify.

Many thanks,
	Tim

Kris Moser says that a sit-down virtual reality machine
will be open to the public this weekend at Stonestown Mall
in San Francisco. The charge will be  dollar a minute.
Apparently, two games will be available; one is a shooting
game on platforms in the air while being harried by
pterodactyls. This is one of the two units being offered
by a British company for about $50k.

Get busy, get creative - prizes await the three best doors.

To Fellow Refrigerator Users (near Lois' office):

There's some stuff in there that has been sitting for a while.  If it is
yours, kindly remove it.  It's getting pretty raw it there.  With the holidays
coming up, we should clean it up before we leave, or I'd hate to be the first
one to open it on 1/2.

Thanks,

Subj:	ROAD RIOT ON TV


I don't know exactly what happened, but I'll find out!

The "Hot at the Arcade" segment of Game Pro did not appear on Saturday morning.
I taped the show on Sunday, but I didn't get a chance to review that program
but I assume it was a re-broadcast of Saturday's show.

I will call the producer of the show today to see when the Road Riot segment
will be on and let you know.

If any of you got up at 6:30 to watch that bogus show, I'm sorry!

Once again Sega is allowing us a chance to purchase their Genesis System and
game carts at a discounted price.  The list is too long for me to include in
this memo, but if you are interested please call me at x491 or come by my
office to place your order.  Please don't send me mail, I rarely read it!  The
system itself will be sold for $124.00 and will include one Sonic the Hedgehog
game (whatever that is!).  If you would like to purchase additional games the
prices do vary and there are alot of them, so please stop by for prices and
additional information.  Ok!  Now for the catch, you MUST place your order with
us (Tina or myself) NO LATER THAN 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday Dec 18th.  I know
this is short notice but we just received the list late Friday afternoon.  We
won't be able to extend the deadline for ANYONE because we have to have the
entire order in to Sega at this time.  We will be picking up the goods Will
Call on Thursday evening, so you can pick them up from us on Friday!
Thank You,

    Hi Jed.  Mr. Moncrief mentioned that you and he might want some
  Multisync II PCB's stuffed and waved over the shutdown (production)
  period.  If you have some sort of parts list for this board, I could
  pull a kit for them this week before we go.  Rick mentioned probably
  @ 25 boards.  What do you think?

     Jed and I have discussed the surface mount issue with Fine Pitch.
  They are aware that the VRAMs are small outline J leads, 40 pin, with
  50 mil centers, and are due to Atari Games @ Jan 2.  I told them I 
  would try to get the boards and VRAMs to them on Monday, Jan. 6. I 
  also told them that a 5 day turnaround would suffice, which means that
  if all goes well Karen would have the assembled surface mount boards
  on @ Jan. 10 (Friday) or Jan. 13 (Monday).  
     Please be aware of the shortages to Karen's kit for 25 boards as
  listed above.  I am changing all quantities per on the kit to reflect
  only the amount I have available in our stockroom, so that no shortages
  will be created on the production shortage report.  Obtaining the
  above parts for successful completion of said 25 boards is now in the
  hands of our engineering group (Unless, of course, I am directed to 
  do otherwise by Mr. Stewart and/or Mr. Smith).
    I should have this kit pulled by Thursday morning of this week.
  Is it Karen I should call when the kit is available?
    Please get back to me soon if there are any changes, questions or
  comments pertaining to this scenario.  Thank you.
