           DSFX - SFX 65816 disassembler v1.20 - (c) 1992 The Voice Over

     The SFX 65816 disassembler is a tool I threw together for the purpose of
making it easier for me to find cheats, secret keys, etc. for SNES games.  It
is a symbolic disassembler that will use any SNES binary image file (such as
those created by a Game Doctor/Super Magicom/Super Twin/etc.) for its input, and
it will produce either source code that can be reassembled into object code
(assuming you have a 65816 assembler and set up you OBJs and ORGs correctly) or
a listing file, such as might be created by an assembler creating a .LST file
to disk.  Keep in mind when using it that I haven't spent a WHOLE lot of time
on this ware; it may still have a bug or two, and it could certainly use one or
two features.  Okay...enough of this...on to the ware.

     The command line for DSFX may contain the name of a file you wish to
disassemble.  If no file is specified, DSFX will simply come up in command mode,
and most of the commands won't work until you use the LOAD command to specify
a file for disassembly.  For example, to start DSFX and specify that you want
to work on a file called MARIOWRL.BIN, you'd use the following command line:

C:\DSFX>DSFX MARIOWRL.BIN

     If the file you want to disassemble is not in the same subdirectory as
DSFX, just provide the full pathname of the file.  If a symbol table called
"MARIOWRL.DST" exists in the same subdirectory as MARIOWRL.BIN, MARIOWRL.DST
will be loaded as the default symbol table.
     When run, DSFX will attempt to load a symbol table called SFXDEF.DST if it
has not loaded a symbol table associated with the file specified on the command
line.  If SFXDEF.DST is present in the current subdirectory, DSFX will load it
as the default symbol table.  I've included a generic header symbol table that
specifies the reset and interrupt vectors for the 65816 as well as the short
data area where the name of the SNES game is stored as data areas.  This data
area starts at $FFC0, and should be the logical starting point for disassembling
any SNES game.  Oh, also, you may notice that addresses are not entirely
contiguous.  IE., The address that follows $FFFF is $18000.  This is because the
Super Nintendo hardware maps the first 16 megabits of cartridge ROM into 32K
segments, each of which starts at location $8000, in banks $00-$3F.  DSFX
converts the absolute addresses into the binary image file to the segmented
addresses used by the SNES.

     Once DSFX is run, the screen will clear, and you should see the following:

     The *_ is the DSFX prompt (Yes, it's a throwback to the days of the Apple
][ monitor).  At this point, DSFX is ready for you to begin entering commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUIT: Exits the DSFX disassembler.  Note that if you have made changes to the
symbol table that you have not yet saved, they will be lost if you quit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOAD pathname: Specifies the name of the file that DSFX is to disassemble.  A
full pathname may be specified, including extension.  Examples:

*load mariowrl.bin
*load \util\nintendo\sfxgames\addams.bin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LSYM filename: Specifies the name of a symbol table to be loaded as DSFX's
current symbol table.  Note that if a symbol table is already loaded, the new
symbol table will replace the old, rather than having both present at once.  No
extension may be specified, as DSFX appends the extension ".DST" to the end of
the filename you specify.  Also, full pathnames are not allowed for the LSYM
command.  Example:

*lsym addams

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SSYM filename: Saves the current symbol table.  When specifying a filename,
extensions and paths are not allowed, just as with LSYM.  Example:

*ssym addams



DASM pathname [start [end]]: Disassembles the current file into source code. 
Default start address is $8000, and default end address is the end of the binary
file.  Note that end address may not be specified unless start address is
specified also.  Examples:

*dasm mariowrl.asm 8000 ffff       Disassembles the first 32K of the current
                                    file into a file called MARIOWRL.ASM

*dasm mariowrl.asm 1f0000          Disassembles the current file into a file
                                    called MARIOWRL.ASM, starting at address
                                    $1F0000

*dasm mariowrl.asm                 Disassembles the entire contents of the
                                    current file into a file called MARIOWRL.ASM

     Note that disassembly files do not include addresses or opcode/operand
data.  They contain ONLY labels, mnemonics, and an operand field if appropriate. 
IE.:

           ORG $8000
RESET      SEI 
           STZ $4200
           STZ $420C
           STZ $420B
           STZ $2140
           STZ $2141
           STZ $2142
           STZ $2143
           LDA #$80
           STA $2100
           CLC 
           XCE 
           REP #$38
           LDA #$0000
           TCD 
           LDA #$01FF
           TCS 
           LDA #$F0A9
           STA RAMSTART
           LDX #$017D
           LDY #$03FD
           LDA #$008D
            :     :

     This file can then be assembled by a 65816 disassembler (it may or may not
be necessary to change the assembler directives that DSFX outputs for things
like hex data, etc.  I used the assembler directives that I'm most familiar
with, which are those of ORCA/M, for the Apple...I don't know how well they'll
translate to the cross-assemblers that're available for the PC.  As soon as I've
got an idea of what cross-assemblers people are using (if they're using any at
all), I may change DSFX's output format.



FOUT pathname [start [end]]: Similar to DASM, but produces "list file" style
output rather than "source file" style output.  Examples:

*fout mariowrl.asm 8000 ffff       Lists the first 32K of the current file into
                                    a file called MARIOWRL.ASM

*fout mariowrl.asm 1f0000          Lists the current file into a file called
                                    MARIOWRL.ASM, starting at address $1F0000

*fout mariowrl.asm                 Lists the entire contents of the current file
                                    into a file called MARIOWRL.ASM

     A list file will probably be the most useful, since it will include
addresses that you will be able to search for using your favorite editor.  An
example of the output you might get using the FOUT command:

008000 78          RESET      SEI 
008001 9C 00 42               STZ $4200
008004 9C 0C 42               STZ $420C
008007 9C 0B 42               STZ $420B

   :    :  :  :                :     : 


     Note that output produced with FOUT is the same as that of the L command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HEDR val: Specify length of file header.  This command allows you to specify a
region at the start of the file being disassembled that is a header used by a
game doctor and should be ignored by DSFX.  Specifically, this option was added
to make Super Magicom files disassembleable in their native format.  Example:

*hedr 200           Specify a $200 (512) byte header at the start of the file.



[addr/label]L: Disassemble the next 22 lines of code to the screen.  Specifying
an address or a label before the "L" will cause disassembly to begin at the
specified address.  Examples:

*8000l
008000 78          RESET      SEI 
008001 9C 00 42               STZ $4200

LAB addr [label]: Defines a label at a given address, or displays the properties
of a label that already exists for a given address, if no label is specified. 
If either the label or address specified in the LAB command already exists, you
will be prompted to confirm replacement of the existing label/address. 
Examples:

*lab 7f8000 ramstart          Defines a label called RAMSTART at address $7F8000
*lab 7f8000 ramtop            Replace label at $7F8000 with label "RAMTOP".
This address is already associated with label RAMSTART.
Press 'R' to replace, any other key to cancel: r
*lab 8000                     Displays information about label for address $8000
 Location: $8000
     Name: RESET
*lab ffc0                     Displays information about label for address $FFC0
 Location: $FFC0
     Name: TITLE
Data type: ASCII text
 Elements: $16

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DC type addr len label: Define a data area.  This command allows you to specify
parts of the object file that should be disassembled as data rather than as
executable code.  When specifying a data area, the following parameters MUST be
included:

type: The type of data stored in this data area (see below).
addr: The starting address of this data area.
len: The hexadecimalnumber of ELEMENTS of data stored in this data area.
label: The label for this data area.

There are five types of data recognized by DSFX, as shown in this table:

Type # Description
---- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A  2 Address - A two byte address, stored low-high.
  B  3 Banked address - A three byte address, stored low-high-bank.
  C  1 Characters - ASCII text.
  H  1 Hex - Hexadecimal data.
  W  4 Word - A four-byte word of data, stored lowest-low-high-highest.

     The figure in the # column indicates how many bytes of memory are occupied
by each element of data of this type.  Thus, specifying a data area for data of
type W (long word) with four elements of data causes sixteen bytes of code to
be interpreted as data rather than as code, starting at the specified address. 
As with LAB, if the address or label specified already exists, you will be
prompted to confirm replacement.  Examples:

*dc a fffe 1 irqvec           Specifies that a single two-byte address called
                               "irqvec" is stored at location $FFFE.  Two bytes
                               of data will be reserved.
*dc h ffd6 a miscinfo         Specifies that a table of $A hex bytes called
                               "miscinfo" is stored at location $FFD6.  Ten
                               bytes of data will be reserved.
*dc w 290a1 4 longtable       Specifies that a table called "longtable",
                               consisting of four long words is stored at
                               location $290A1. 16 bytes of data will be
                               reserved.



REG ax addr: Specify register width, starting at address addr.  This command
allows you to specify the width of the accumulator and index registers,
beginning at a specific address, and continuing on until one of the following
conditions occurs:

1) A higher address with a different register width specification is reached.

2) An SEP or REP instruction is disassembled, which, if run, would affect the
   M or X flags of the 65816.  (DSFX will automatically change the disassembly
   mode to reflect the change in register width that the SEP or REP instruction
   would cause).

     Note that although DSFX will automatically adjust the register width for
its output to reflect changes to the M and X flags caused by SEP and REP
instructions, the REG command will cause DSFX to preselect the correct register
width when you use the "L", "DASM", or "FOUT" commands.  I recommend that you
use the REG command to set a register width on any SEP and REP commands that
affect the M or X flags, as well as the start of any subroutines you
disassemble.  Note that in this version of DSFX, the maximum number of register
width changes that may be defined is 128, so if you're planning to do a full-
tilt disassembly of a program, use them wisely.

     The format of the command (REG ax addr) may seem a bit confusing, but is
actually fairly easy to understand.  The address at which the specified register
widths are to become used is defined in addr.  The widths of the accumulator and
index registers are specified by supstituting a 1 or a 0 for a and x
respectively.  If a 1 is defined, the specified register's width will be 8 bits. 
If a 0 is defined, the specified register's width will be 16 bits.  Examples:

*reg 11 8000             Specifies accumulator and index registers are 8 bits
                          starting at address $8000.
*reg 00 801d             Specifies accumulator and index registers are 16 bits
                          starting at address $801D.
*reg 10 1E300            Specifies 8-bit accumulator and 16-bit index registers
                          starting at address $1E300.
*reg 01 39FFE            Specifies 16-bit accumulator and 8-bit index registers
                          starting at address $39FFE.



DUMP [addr [length]]: Perform a hex/ASCII dump of [length] bytes, starting at
location [addr].  If a length is specified, a start address must be specified

XDUMP [addr [length]] val: Perform a hex/ASCII dump of [length] bytes,
exclusive-ored with the specified value, starting at the specified address.  As
with DUMP, if length is specified, start address must also be specified.  The
value with which to XOR the data is required.  Examples:

*xdump ff                Dumps 256 bytes, starting at the current PC, exclusive-
                          oring them with $FF.
*xdump ff00 ff           Dumps 256 bytes, starting at $FF00, exclusive-oring
                          them with $FF.
*xdump ff00 14 aa        Dumps $14 bytes, starting at $FF00, exclusive-oring
                          them with $AA.

SFX addr: Print SNES-equivalent banked address for specified absolute address. 
This command will allow you to enter absolute offsets within a file that you may
find using Norton DiskEdit or other file editing program, and will return the
banked address to which DSFX and the SNES will translate that offset.  Example:

*sfx c203
01C203

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABS addr: Similar to SFX, but accepts an SFX address as its input, and displays
the equivalent absolute address.  It occurred to me after I released v1.00 that
it might be useful to know the offset into the image file of an address you
find using DSFX.  Example:

*abs 1c203
00C203



FIND xx [..16]: Search the file for a sequence of up to 16 bytes.  Useful for
locating instructions and data.  Note that the fewer bytes you specify in your
search, the more locations will be found containing the specified data.  I
recommend ALWAYS specifying at least two bytes to be found with the FIND
command.  Example:

*find a9 05
0099D4  009B50  00ABC4  00ABFB  00AC24  00AC4D  00AD0B  00C33F  00C920  00E2C9

GRAB name start [end]: Extracts the region from start to end from the file being
disassembled, and writes it to a second file.  If end address is not specified,
the last address of the source file is assumed.  I added this command because
one of the suggestions I have received since I released v1.00 was to add the
capability to disassemble code that's going to be run on the SNES' sound
processor.  I think the best way to handle that is to just have a seperate
disassembler for that microprocessor, so if I ever actually DO write it, that's
what the GRAB command is for...extracting code for the sound processor into a
seperate file that can then be disassembled by another program.  If anyone
else comes up with a use for this, please let me know.  Example:

*grab marsound.bin 17300 1ffff     Extract the region from $17300 to $1FFFF
                                    from the source file, and write it to a
                                    file called "MARSOUND.BIN"



Revision history:

v1.00: Released 5/11/92.

v1.10: Corrected bug in DC that caused length to be interpreted as a decimal
        value rather than a hexadecimal value.
       Corrected bug in FOUT and DASM commands that caused auto-selection of
        start and end address to fail, causing a "Subscript out of range"
        error if start address was not specified.
       Corrected bug in FOUT and DASM commands that caused end address to
        be interpreted to be the same as start address if both start and end
        address were specified.
       Corrected bug which caused FOUT to not work at all.
       Corrected bug in LAB that caused a "Subscript out of range" error if
        the word LAB was followed by a non-hexadecimal expression that did
        not match a defined label.
       Corrected bug which caused default symbol table to not be loaded if
        a file with no associated symbol table was specified for disassembly
        on the command line.
       Added ABS command.
       Added GRAB command.
       Included default symbol table that I forgot to include with v1.00.

v1.20: Corrected bug which caused addresses produced by branch instructions
        to be misinterpreted when searching for associated labels.
       Corrected bug which caused the operands of short JMP and JSR instructions
        to be misinterpreted.
       Added HEDR command.
       Added DELL command.
       Added ability to replace existing labels.

Thanks to:

Fabulous Furlough- For the idea behind the HEDR command, as well as the impetus
to add label deletion/replacement.

R. Bubba Magillicutty- For pointing out the problem with the disassembly of JMP
and JSR instructions, because I'd have DIED before I noticed that as a problem.
