1. Introduction

This information was gleaned from disassembling the Sega Genesis and
the Super Nintendo and their cartridges.  The contents of this file
does not come from confidential sources.

The average Sega Genesis/Megadrive cartridge consists of a ROM chip and 
sometimes a battery backed up static ram chip.  The signals to and from
the cartridge are all CMOS level (rail to rail voltage swings) and therefore
all chips which interface to a cartridge or the Genesis/Megadrive should
be CMOS compatible parts.  When using the 74 series chips, be sure
to use either 74HC or 74HCT family.  When using EPROMS, be sure they are
CMOS compatible.  The Sega Genesis uses a CMOS variant of the Motorola
68000.  Therefore, there are 16 data lines and 23 address lines at the 
cartridge slot.

Sega cartridges almost exclusively use a single mask programmed 16 bit 
wide ROM chip in their cartridges, but third party manufacturers sometimes 
use multiple (sometimes 8 bit wide) ROM chips.  Therefore, reading a
Genesis cartridge consists of asserting the address and chip select
lines low, setting the address lines to the address you want to read
and reading the data of the data lines.  Playing back a game read from
a cartridge consists of writing the data to an EPROM or equivalent and
connecting it to the Genesis.

The pinouts for the cartridge port is as follows:

When standing in front of the Genesis, b is frontward, a is rearward,
1 is to the left and 32 is to the right.

2. The Cartridge Reader

2.1 About the IBM PC Parallel Port and the Cartridge Reader

The cartridge reader is designed to interface with the IBM PC (and
compatibles) parallel printer port.  Although I could have used one of
the backplane slots to read the cartridge, the parallel port was
selected because it is easier to construct a device that physically
plugs into it and they are cheap to replace in case you fry your parallel
port.  The disadvantage (from the designer's standpoint) is that you
only have 12 bits of data coming out of it (8 parallel port data and 4
control) and you can only feed in 4 bits of data into the parallel port.

The solution to this is to use registers/octal latches (the 74HCT374).
What we do is feed the address we want to read into the latches and
then read the data off the data lines.  Two of the parallel port
handshake lines are used to select between the three 8 bit
registers/latches.  Since the Genesis ROM has a 16 bit datapath, we
add an extra address line (A0) to select between the upper and lower 8
bits.  We still have to feed this 8 bit data into a 4 bit port so we
use a 74HCT244 as a data selector to select between the upper and
lower 4 bits of data.  Another control line is used to make the
selection.  Note that because of the way IBM designed their parallel
prot, the highest bit of this 4 bit input is inverted.

2.2 Building the Cartridge Reader

Be sure to use the 74HCT family or equivalent when purchasing the parts.
The HCT family means that the chips are "high speed", CMOS level outputs
and TTL level inputs.

You can either print out the PCB pattern I provided or wire wrap the
circuit.  Another option is to use a breadboard but you must be
careful because breadboard projects tend to loosen their wires over a
period of time. The filename for the schematic is READ-SCH and the
filename for the pattern is READ-PAT.

If you want to etch your own PCB, one thing you can try is the laser
printer direct method.  Print the pattern on a plastic sheet and iron
the sheet to a clean copperclad board.  The laser printer toner will
transfer from the plastic to the copperclad and act as a resist.  You
then toss the copperclad into some etchant and clean it off when you
are done.

To build the cartridge reader, you will need the following parts:
2 - 74HCT139
3 - 74HCT374
2 - 74HCT244
7 - .1 microFarad capacitors
1 - male DB25 connector
1 - 64 pin card edge connector with .100 inch contact centers
1 - 5 volt power source (you can use a 5 volt source from inside your PC)

The first 5 parts are fairly easily obtainable.  If you don't have a
good electronics store in your area, you can mail order the parts from
Digikey (call 1 800 344 4539 and ask for a catalog).  The 64 pin card
edge connector is fairly hard to find.  3M makes such an item but only
in the ribbon cable variant.  What I did was to use the 3M connector
with a ribbon cable and put DIP plugs on the other end of the ribbon.
If you decide to do this, be sure to keep the ribbon cable short (i.e.
4 inches or less) to cut down on the noise.  When using the 3M connector,
you have to shave off the edges in order to get it to fit in a Genesis
cartridge.  If you can't find a 64 pin connector, you can get a 72 pin
connector, insert a barrier key to separate off 64 pins and cut off
the extra 8 pins.

The capacitors go between +5 and ground.  Put one as near as possible
to each chip.

Keep the connection between the IBM PC parallel port and the cartridge
reader as short as possible to reduce the noise factor.

2.3 Software

All programs are written in C and were compiled using Borland C/C++.
All you need to do to convert them to Microcrud C or Zortech or whatever
else, just change the outport() and inport() function calls to whatever
your compiler uses.

The software is provided as READCART.C,  TESTCART.C and SIZETEST.C.

READCART.C reads the data from the cartridge and writes to the
specified file.  If no file specification is given, it will write it
to game.dat.  You must also specify the size of the file in megabits.
The program is hard coded to read data from LPT1:.  If you use another
parallel port, be sure to change the address macro definitions.

TESTCART.C is a program to test the cartridge reader.  Feed the lower
16 bits of the address back into the data lines and this program will
verify correct operation of the cartridge reader.

SIZETEST.C is a program to automatically determine the size (in
megabits) of a cartridge plugged into the cartridge reader.

2.4 Testing and Debugging

Hook up the address lines to the data lines (A1 goes to D0, A2 goes to
D1, etc) and run the TESTCART.C program.  If you get consistent
errors, then you have a wiring problem or you forgot to hook up the +5
volt power source.  If you get random errors, you have a noise
problem.  Shorten the cables between the cartridge and the reader and
the compuer and the reader.  Add more capacitors to your power source.
If you still get noise errors, play with the delay factor on line 25
of TESTCART.C and/or add pullup or pulldown resistors or both to the
lines going to and from the parallel port.

When you feel confident that everything is working, plug in a
cartridge and read it in two or three times.  Do a compare of the
files you get to make sure there are no noise problems.  Offset
100-19f hex should contain ASCII info on whatever cartridge you have
plugged in.  If it doesn't, try another cartridge.  It should say
something like:

SEGA GENESIS (C) SEGA 1992.FEB SONIC THE HEDGEHOG
etc.

Almost all Sega produced games say SEGA GENESIS at offset 100 hex.

If it appears that the byte order is switched (i.e. it comes
out ESAGG NESESI or something like that), then the four wires from the 
74HCT139 to the 74HCT244's are switched around.  If you can't find
the text at offset 100 hex, try looking at 1 hex and 10000 hex. If
you find it at one of those locations, then the 3 wires going from
the 74HCT139 to the 74HCT374's are switched around.


3. Playing Back What You Read.

In order to play back what you read out of the cartridge, you will
need to store it in either static RAM, EPROM or flash memory.  If you
are going to store it in EPROM or flash memory, you will need an EPROM
programmer.  Needham Electronics (916 924 8037) sells a nice one for very cheap.
Flash memory is especially nice since you erase it electronically like
static RAM, it is non-volatile like an EPROM and programs very fast.
Unfortunately, they are hard to find.  Microprocessors Unlimited
(918 267 6961; ask for a price sheet) sells the Intel 28F020 flash
memory as well as EPROMs and static RAM.  The 28F020 is a 2 megabit
chip and is 8 bits wide so you will need two of them.  EPROMS have
the highest density but they are the hardest to program and are a pain
to erase (you have to put them under a ultra-violet lamp).  The last
time I checked, static RAM only comes in 1 megabit configurations and
you have to provide some sort of battery backup when transferring
programs from the IBM PC to the Genesis.

The easiest way to make a carrier for your memory chips is to get a
cartridge that already has two 8 bit wide chips on it and hack it
apart.  Early Electronics Arts games use such an arrangement.  Clip
off all the legs of each of the chips and desolder each of them one by
one.  Replace each of the chips with a ZIF (Zero Insertion Force)
socket.  Some of the larger ZIF sockets may not fit in your cartridge.
Aries Electronics has a small low profile ZIF socket you can buy from
Digikey (see above).

If you want to make your own, I have provided a PCB pattern called
CART-PAT.

When you program your memory, if you are using 8 bit wide memory, you
will need to program one chip with the even addresses and one chip
with the odd addresses. 

4. Battery Backed up RAM Games

When A21 goes high, then the chip select (*CS) of the battery backed
up RAM is active (low).  Just connect *CS, *OE, *WE and the rest of
the address and data lines to the SRAM.

5. Using the Cartridge Reader with the Super Nintendo

The Super Nintendo cartridge is very similar to the Sega Genesis
arrangement.  The two main differences are that the Sega has 16 data
lines while the Super Nintendo has 8 and the Super Nintendo has a
lockout chip.

To adapt the Sega cartridge reader to the Super Nintendo, just wire
the address lines on the cartridge reader to the proper lines on the
Super Nintendo (i.e. A1 on the Sega goes to A0 on the SNES, A2-Sega
goes to A1-SNES, etc) and the D0-D8 lines on the SNES go to the D0-D8
lines on the cartridge reader.  Line 85 of of READCART.C contains the
code you need to modify in order to convert it to reading Super
Nintendo cartridges.

The lockout chip really doesn't do much of anything.  All the Super
Nintendo does is detect its presence.  If the lockout chip is properly
connected, the Super Nintendo will read the cartridge.  If not, it
won't.  You may want to use pullup resistors to tie the inputs/outputs
to the lockout chip high so you don't leave anything floating when you
read the cartridge.

The cartridge connector inside the Super Nintendo console consists of
a connector 3 13/16 inches wide using .100 inch contact centers.
There are 62 pins total, but there are 8 pins on either side which are
separated from the 46 pins in the center.  The width of the connector
is roughly the same as a 70 pin solder tail connector so you can use
one of those with a pair of barrier keys to center the cartridge
fingers.

If you are looking at the Super Nintendo from the front of the
console, the connector pins towards the front are numbered from
1 to 31 from left to right and the connector pins towards the rear are
numbered from 32 to 62 from left to right.  Remember that for most
cartridges, only the center 46 pins are used so that the fingers on
the cartridge are numbered from 5 to 27 and from 36 to 58.

The pinouts are as follows:

5  - gnd                   36 - gnd
6  - A11                   37 - A12
7  - A10                   38 - A13
8  - A9                    39 - A14
9  - A8                    40 -
10 - A7                    41 - A15
11 - A6                    42 - *OE
12 - A5                    43 - A19
13 - A4                    44 - A16
14 - A3                    45 - A17
15 - A2                    46 -
16 - A1                    47 -
17 - A0                    48 -
18 -                       49 - *CS
19 - D0                    50 - D4
20 - D1                    51 - D5
21 - D2                    52 - D6
22 - D3                    53 - D7
23 - A18                   54 - *WE
24 - Lockout chip pin 1    55 - Lockout Chip pin 2
25 - Lockout chip pin 7    56 - Lockout chip pin 6
26 -                       57 -
27 - +5                    58 - +5

The *CS line of the battery backed up RAM goes active (low) when A18 is
low, A17 is high and pins 26, 46 and 47 of the cartridge connector are high.

The best way to make a playback cartridge is to scavange an existing
Super Nintendo cartridge and wiring an adapter to that.  Just desolder
the existing mask ROM and wire in an adapter from the Sega Genesis
playback cartridge.  This way, you already have a lockout chip and
battery backed up RAM already in place.  The schematic is SNES-SCH.

The pinouts for the mask ROM are as follows:

1  A19  32 +5
2  A16  31 *CE
3  A15  30 A17
4  A12  29 A14
5  A7   28 A13
6  A6   27 A8
7  A5   26 A9
8  A4   25 A11
9  A3   24 *OE
10 A2   23 A10
11 A1   22 A18
12 A0   21 D7
13 D0   20 D6
14 D1   19 D5
15 D2   18 D4
16 gnd  17 D3
