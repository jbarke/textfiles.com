meter. Each time you have defeated an enemy, a head appears. The number 10
represents 10 enemies. Once you get to the part of the fourth level where
there is a door, press UP at the first door to go into it. If you do not
have 30 or more enemies shown at the top of the screen when you get to this
point, it will not work. Be caraful! Once you continue your game after you
lose your last life, the defeated enemies will be gone and you will have
to gain enough of to make the trick work at that part of the fourth stage.

middle of the land and make a cross with these roads all the way to the edge
of the map of you land. Do not connect the cross in the middle of the water,

"Start New City" again on the menu screen. Wait, and the same map that you
chose earlier will turn out to be a different map with the same number! This
works all the way from map 1 to 999, giving you a total for 1998 instead of
the regular 999.

Character vs. Character
-----------------------

The ultimate trick for Street Fighter 2 is here! This trick will allow you
to fight the alter ego of any player controlled character in the game! It
will not allow you to control any of the computer controlled bosses. To do
this trick, you must put in ten cartridge and turn on the Super NES on. As 
the Capcom logo fades in, press these buttons in this order: DOWN, R Button,
UP, L Button, Y, B, X, A. Make sure to get the code in before the logo fades
out. As soon as you do this, you will hear musical tones which confirm that
the trick has worked. Now, when you press START, the title screen will turn
blue instead of the normal color, black. Now when you choose VS. Mode, two
players will be able to choose the same character. Also, when you start a
one player game, the players you fight against will be a totally different
alter color. All of the characters you can choose shown on the player select
screen. Turn to CHAOS for the best in awesome new tricks!


Configure Screen
----------------

To get the screen where you can configure your buttons without resetting
the game and going to the option screen, lose a match in the 1 player mode
or fight in the 2 player mode. After the match is over, hold the SELECT
Button in the player selection screen. After you have chosen your options,
stages, etc, you will get the screen below when you press START to begin
your new match.


Ken VS. Computer Trick(2)
-------------------------

This is an alternate method to play Ken vs. the computer controlled Ken.
First, you must start a one player game. When you get to the player select 
screen, highlight Guile's picture, but not push any buttons. Eventually the
computer will pick Guile and send him to Ken's stage. Once he is there,
press START on controller 2. You will be brought back to the player select
screen. Pick E.Honda as your second player and you will now go back into
Ken's stage. You must now wait until the time runs out for 4 rounds. If you
hit any player during this time, the trick will not work. At the end of four
rounds, Guile will lose the match, leaving his defeated face on the continue
screen. Next, press the START button on controller 2 before the counter
reaches 0 and you will return to the right side of the player select screen.
Take controller 2 and pick Ken. You will see the same color Ken show up on
the left of the screen before ypou enter the first round. You will be
fighting the computer clone of yourself! You will start on the right side
of the screen and, unfortunately, it is very easy to get confused with Ken
you are. If you want to alter the trick, simply put in the Character vs.
Character Trick (DOWN, R-Button, UP, L-Button, Y, B, as the Capcom log fades
in). Do the new Ken vs. Computer Ken(2) trick that was just described and
press START whenever you choose your characters. Both of the Kens will be in
their alter ego colors, but the trick itself will not change. You can fight
as Ken vs Computer Ken as many times as you want, as long as you always lose
all your matches against the computer-controlled players.


Chun Li's Two New Sayings
-------------------------

Now you can access the hidden message that ChunLi says in Street Fighter II.
First, put in the Character vs. Character trick (Press, DOWN, R Button, UP,
L-Button, Y, B as the Capcom logo fades in). Start a one player game and
pick Chun Li as your player. Next, press START on controller 2 and pick the
other Chun Li. It does not matter what stage they fly to. Once you do this
have the two fight, or just take one of the Chun Li's and have her trash the
other one. When the match is over, the Chun Li that won the match will most
likely say one of two new messages that she does not give when fighting the
other Street Fighters! This is random. and Chun Li might still give her
normal sayings too.


Go Straight To Bosses
---------------------

Here is an easy way to go right to the bosses in Street Fighter II. Start a

stage, pres START on controller 2 and beat that person up for bith rounds.
Now, wait for the next fighter's stage to appear and do the same thing for
each and every one of the fighters. You can now make your way to Balrog
without fighting any of the previous characters!


See All Character Profiles
--------------------------

Now there is a way to see all eigth of the character profiles in order
without waiting for the demonstration fights or the title screen to come
up again. Wait for the title screen to go by, and when you see the first
profile of a fighter, take controller 2 and hold the L and R-Buttons at
the top of the controller. If you keep holding these, the profiles of each
World Warrior will appear one right after the other.

do it, you must first pick a male right-handed bowler give hima 16 pound

rights side of the screen. Move the pointer three taps to the left with the
top L-Button. While the curve meter is going back and forth, stop it on the
red arrows, or all the way to the far left. Once the power meter appears,
stop the meter when the brackets are the furthest apart (or when the meter
is at full power). When you let go of the ball, it will curve to the left

whole game and you'll end up with perfect 300 point play!
