This guide is a compilation I organized from the r.g.v faq, the snes
cheats list (maintained by ) all the relevant usenet articles in r.g.v and
r.g.v.n while I was working on SMW, and some personal observations from
my brother and byself.  A quick grep of the headers of the raw data
reveals the following sources for credit:

Spots that start with a < or > are mostly from the SNES cheats list,
ones with an * are my own personal observations that I haven't ever
seen mentioned on the net.  Personal observations and notes from the
above netters are also incorporated where they seem most appropriate.

 1 - GENERAL TIPS

Remember that pressing START followed by SELECT will drop you back to
  the map screen, if you've completed the level before.  Handy for collecting
  a needed powerup near the start of a nearby level.

Berries for Yoshi - 10 Red Berries will cause an egg to hatch into a
  Super Mushroom.  2 Pink Berries will cause an egg to hatch into coins.
  3 Green Berries will add 20 seconds to the timer.

Yoshi and Shells - If Yoshi spits out a Blue or Green Shell before
  swallowing it, it can be reused.

* Some times you want to fly, but have no room to get going.  If you
  hold the Y button down and keep changing directions, mario's arms
  will eventually lift up.  Now you can fly.  This allows you to fly
  in lots of places, but in really small spots it doesn't help (like
  at the begining of TUBULAR).

Yoshi and P-Switches - After stomping a P-Switch, use Yoshi to pick it
  up.  When Yoshi spits it back out, it will again be reusable.

Mario can take a direct hit from any creature if riding Yoshi.

Mario can hold 2 items at once by stacking one on the other then
  picking up both.

Magic Number 1-Up - If the tens digit of the star bonus achieved by
  breaking the goal post tape matches both the ones and the tens digit
  of the time remaining on the timer, you will earn a 1-Up.  (seems like
  a lot more trouble than it's worth)

1-Up Blocks - In the five tiered 1-Up chambers, Mario can collect all 5
  1-Ups if he uses his cape.  Spin jump and hit the lower corner of each
  block with the cape.  The first two block in each row yield coins, the
  third will yield a 1-Up.

Get Back Into Castles - To reenter castles once you have destroyed them,
  press the 'L' and 'R' buttons at the same time while standing on
  the site of the castle.

Just what is the utility of a Firey Mario in SMW? - 3 of the
  Koopalings can be beaten by fireballs.  Hit Morton, Ludwig, or Roy 12
  times w/ fireballs and they are history.  This is particularly useful
  against Morton and Roy who move pretty fast once you get them upset.

Bonus Items - At the end of every world, carry a turtle shell, P-block,
  or an enemy through the high bar.  It will turn into a power-up item
  that you can use in the next world.

Power-Ups Between Stages - Carry a P-Switch or a Koopa Shell through an
  exit gate and the power-up item in the reserve box will transform as
  follows:

 2 - STAGE SPECIFIC TIPS

Yoshi's Island 2

   1-Ups: For someone who hasn't advanced far in SMW, the easiest source of
   one-ups is Yoshi's Island 2.  Enter with Yoshi, then bumping the block
   that normally gives Yoshi gives a one-up.  Use START and SELECT to jump
   out of the course and repeat as often as desired.  It is a little
   faster if Mario is caped and you enter at the middle of Yoshi's Island
   2.  Then one can get a life every 10 seconds or so with no skill
   required.  I generally run it up to the maximum of 99 lives in order to
   pay for the increasingly long trip back to Yoshi's Island.

Donut island 2

Secret Exit:  Try jumping up every green pipe until you
  succeed.  Now, do not exit this room to the a normal looking goal
  (it is not considered the second exit).  There are about 4 yellow
  blocks leading to the top of the screen, fly up and the the hightest
  one with your head and vine will go up from it.  No jump up the series
  of yellow blocks and climb the vine.  The key and hole is to the 
  left.

Donut Ghost House

  Secret Exit:  Get a cape.  Enter the first ghost house and walk to
  the right until the first hole in the floor.  Hold the Y button to spin.
  Run to the left until able to fly, jump and fly up the left hand wall 
  until you can land on a ledge to your right.  Run all the way across 
  the house, off the ledge, down the left side, hit each block for a
  1-up mushroom (there are four, and exit out the door at the end.

Donut Secret Ghost House

  Secret exit:

I found the second blue door (above the first one, you
get there by flying and jump on the blue 'P' thing to make it appear,
but once inside there doesn't seem to be an exit).
 
   There's also a vine in one of the blocks.  You can use this to climb there
   if you don't happen to have a cape feather.  Once you get inside the closed
   room, kill the boss by throwing a purple block into him (three times),
   and you will exit.
 
 Top Secret Area
 
   Description - an area where you can fully power
   up, get a Yoshi, and reenter for as many 1-UPs as you want (1 at a time).
 
 Vanilla Dome 2
 
  Secret exit:
 
   When you get to the area where you can decide to finish the level using
   the high road or the low road, use the high road.  Instead of going right,
   jump across to the left.  Push the P-block until it is not on any blocks,
   and then jump on it.  Now go left and knock out all the coins (do not
   go over the edge).  When the P stops you must now jump across to the
   second drop off (you will be back towards the begining), and go down.
   The key and key hole is some where down there.
 
Vanilla Secret 1
   
  Secret Exit:
 
  when you are at the spring board, fly left.  There is a pipe in the
  upper left hand corner by the left wall and ceiling.
 
Vanilla secret 3
 
  1-Ups:  You get 40-50 lives, a power-up,
  and a Yoshi all at once.  I kinda like it, and you are welcome to add
  it to the list if you don't have it already.
  In Vanilla Secret 3, go to the midway tape.  Break the tape and leave
  the world.  Go back in the world, starting at midway.  Go right, until
  you come to a pipe.  In a music box above the pipe is a power-up.
  Continue right, avoiding paratroopers and spiked guys, over the
  chasm, and to the row of blocks above a field of spiked turtles.
  Hit the bottom of the SECOND block in that row.  It is over the spiked
  turtles, but with minimal practice you can hit it easily.  In the
  SECOND block is a P-Block.  DON'T JUMP ON IT!  Grab it, and take it with
  you.  While carrying the P-Block, return back to your left, over the
  chasm, past the pipe you saw before, and past the midway tape.  Continue
  until you get BETWEEN 2 pipes on the same screen.  Each pipe has a
  villian jumping out of it, and there is a chasm just to the left of
  the left pipe.  Set the P-Block down here.
  Jump on the P-Block, jump over the chasm on the left, and run as far
  and as fast as you can left.  Each turtle/villian has turned into a
  coin, and after ~5 of them they are all 3-ups.  Tons of 'em.
  The P-Block power will run out about the time you get back to the Yoshi
  block.  Get Yoshi, and leave the world.  ***NOTE: Don't leave the world
  until the game has finished couting up your lives!!!!  You get so many
  you have to wait till it counts em all.  Voila!  Many lives and a Yoshi.

> 
>   1-Ups: Just before entering the last area of Vanilla Secret Fortress (to face
>   Reznor), you can earn many 1-Ups by repeatedly stomping the Bony Beetles
>   at the Red Door (don't touch the ground - tread water).  At first this
