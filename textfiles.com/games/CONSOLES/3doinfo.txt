  > > > >  THE BATTLE OF THE 32/64 BITS GAME CONSOLE SUPREMACY  < < < <

I had been searching for some time now any kind of text on the 3DO system
on the InterNet, without any luck.  So, I decided to reprint some articles
from Electronic Games, November 1993 to fill the lack.  Be ready for a
complete revolution: this system is not just a video game console, it is
the future of telecommunications.  Already companies such as AT&T are
looking into producing their own system using 3DO technology.  How about
receiving a videophone call in a small window on the screen of your
3DO football game?  Receive/send faxes?  3DO technology is here, the rest
is up to the imagination of the companies.  Hey!  Even Sega or Nintendo can
use 3DO technology if they wanted...  I had read some time ago that the OS
was the Macintosh System 7.  Dunno about that.

After EG/Nov 93, the rest...
----------------------------

But the more I searched, the more details of other machines emerged, the
more I sensed a Battle of the 32/64 bits Consoles...  And I found 3DO
lovers and 3DO bashers; both need to be addressed.  

As well, I found 2 companies on the verge of bankruptcy: Atari and
Commodore, which have put their last eggs in their basket with the release
of video game consoles in the hope to save their respective companies.

Anyways, read on!  If you have any comments, or would like to expand on
this, please feel free to contact me at the InterNet address given at the
end...

3DO: SUPER SYSTEM OR SUPER HYPE?
--------------------------------

3DO has received more media attention and industry interest than any other
product under development in the history of gaming.  Despite this
unprecedented exposure, rumors and misconceptions abound regarding what 3DO
is, and what the first units to ship will provide.

3DO is attempting to position itself as a major player in the coming
information super-highway marketplace.  Recent deregulatino has allowed the
communications industry to redefine itself toward that goal, but the
infrastructure for the digital fiber optic highway is just beginning to be
established.

One of the first steps in this process is selection of a common standard
for delivery of the new media.  3DO hopes to achieve enough market
penetration during these early, formative stages to be accepted as that
broad based standard.

Given that goal, it becomes easier to understand why 3DO opted to control
and license the technology, and not the hardware as Sega and Nintendo did.
The latter created monopolies based on control of proprietary hardware,
acting as the sole source for manufacture, distribution and all other
factors of a product life cycle.

The 3DO Company, on the other hand, does not produce the hardware or deal
with the average consumer directly in any fashion.  Rather, 3DO sells its
technology to other businesses who, in turn, use it for whatever
applications they desire.

The closest analogies to this marketing strategy would be those utilized in
the promotion of the VHS video standard and the Audio CD.  The success of
these standards is widely known, thus it is not surprising that 3DO seeks
to be viewed in a similar context.  A question remains, however, as to how
well they will be able to live up to the analogy over time.

The first opportunity to empirically evaluate their ambitious projections
was provided via Panasonic's introduction of the FZ-1 R.E.A.L. 3DO
Interactive Multiplayer.

FANTASY AND REALITY
-------------------

Contrary to some popular misconceptions, the first home units will not be
capable of the 500-channel Megaplex of Interactive Television that many
users are waiting for.  Also, they will not allow connectivity outside the
home for databases, interactive services, multi-player gaming or many of the
other features currently enjoyed by computer BBS subscribers.  In essence,
the Panasonic 3DO unit is a stand-alone unit very similar to its Sega
Mega-CD cousin, offering similar features but much more polished
applications.

Strictly examining the type of media which may be enjoyed, Panasonic's 3DO
machine supports game CDs developped for the 3DO format, audio CDs
including the CD+Graphics standard, Kodak's Photo CD format and video CDs
up to 60 minutes in length.

It's worthy to note that many of these features are nice-to-have bonuses,
but are not in and of themselves specific selling points to justify 3DO's
700$ asking price. Before focusing on the 3DO architecture exclusively,
however, let's highlight a couple of salient points about the added
features.

{NOTE: Panasonic are asking 700$ for their version of the 3DO.  From
previous experience, we can assure that other 3DO systems by companies such
as Sanyo will sell for much less}

First, the Kodak Photo CD package is very well wrought.  Images may be
pulled from the disk and viewed from 1/16th to 16 times their original
display size.  This allows the user to box a portion of the photo, call it
up to full screen and repeat the process again and again.  Surprisingly,
the 3DO unit continues to scan and refine the clarity of magnified images
the longer  they are displayed.  During EG's test, this technique was used
to focus on the eye of one subject in a photograph and the detail was
sufficient to see the reflection of the photographer on the subject's
cornea.  The resolution produced was truly astounding.

As to video CDs, the 3DO player is currently limited to a full motion video
(FMV) compression routine known as Cinepak.  This standard impressively
reproduces full screen animation, such as segments of Batman, the Animated
Series, at 30 frames per second, but it is less refined than VHS for
conventional video.  On the side of the 3DO player is an FMV expansion slot
which will allow MPEG-1 video decompression via a separately sold module,
available in the first quarter of 1994.  Since MPEG video is supported by
custom, dedicated hardware, the technology produces imagery that is
comparable to VHS, as well as CD quality sound.  Further, since the
multiplayer has a double speed CD drive, capable of 300K/sec access,
greater fidelity is attained.

Expect the first video CDs to be 30 or 60 minutes programs, but feature
film releases for 3DO CD are possibly in the next year or two.

If test marketing of independant cable company 3DO units is successful,
1995 could also see widespread introduction of cable boxes based on an
MPEG-2 standard and 3DO architecture.  Currently, systems allow one channel
per 6Mhz stream, and digital compression will allow eight for the same
bandwidth.

AT&T is also interested in developing phone applications for 3DO, as one
might gather from their television marketing campaign, but it is unclear
wheter their units will be stand-alone or modem type add-on modules for
existing players.

{NOTE: Each company that decides to create a 3DO machine has certain
minimums to respect in their machine; so the AT&T, Panasonic and Sanyo
machines will all be able to play 3DO titles, but each will have specific
additional characteristics.  We can expect high speed modems using the
v.Fast protocol (28,8Kbps) to be used in future machine as standard.  
These will be useful for the VideoPhones already available, but at a 
higher frame rate, just as can be seen in those TV commercials, or in the 
movie "Back to the Future Part III"}

One of the most positive indicators of 3DO's potential long-term viability
is the number of companies developing for a standard which as yet has no
sales figures.  Software availability has always been a major factor in the
success or failure of new hardware systems.  Certainly, sales of Sega's
Mega-CD have suffered a lack of notable software.  3DO, however, lined up a
very impressive list of affiliates and developers before hardware ever
entered production.  At the time of this writing, there were over 360
licensed developers and 110 projects underway.

Some of these companies are new ventures as well, developing only for the
3DO standard.  This bandwagon approach is an unprecedented demonstration of
faith by the software publishers and a strong indicator of expected
success.  There was an outpouring of developer support when Commodore first
introduced the Amiga computer.  However, the cast lined up in the 3DO
corner surpasses even that.

{NOTE: The team of engineers that created the 3DO technology are the same
that created the original Amiga computer back in 1984, bought by Commodore 
and "destroyed" thru very poor marketing; they also created the Atari Lynx
hand-console.}


THAT MAGIC MOMENT
-----------------

After turning on the 3DO player, it rapidly becomes apparent that one has
stepped into new, but familiar territory. The Panasonic unit will remind
players of other video game machines, in terms of console and controller
design.  The latter's housing is like a SNES pad while the button layout is
exactly like the original Sega controller.  The display, however, is better
than anything short of a professional animation station.

3DO achieves the high level of performance by avoiding the traditional
architecture of video games and computers, which place the burden of all
programming functions on a single multipurpose CPU chip.  Instead, 3DO
provides two custom designed graphics animation engines supplemented by
specialized circuits for video processing, digital sound and data flow
management.

A separate memory management unit (MMU) and 24 DMA channels integrate this
architecture with a 32-Bit RISC CPU so that images of up to 16.9 million
colors and animations of 64 million pixels per second are possible.

By way of contrast, current 16-Bit machines handle roughly one million
pixels per second, while 32-Bit computers are capable of three million per
second.

{NOTE: The sound is as impressive!  2 sound processors are available: one
DSP and a Q-Sound chip (3D sound technology used by recording artists such
as Madonna and Eric Clapton).}

This unprecedented graphics power not only enhances the complexity of
displays available for new games, it also allows programmers to incorporate
a lot of built-in special effects without having to design cumbersome
software routines.

The 3DO architecture permits fluid incorporation of warping, transparency,
light sourcing, texture mapping and anti-aliasing effects as base functions
of the architecture.  Because these functions are integral to the hardware,
additional code may be devoted to the meat of games or other applications
without any corresponding loss of presentation power.  Realizing this, one
begins to appreciate why there is such tremendous support from software
developpers.

{NOTE: Prices are expected to be equivalent to computer CD-ROM titles,
which would be around 60$}

**************************************************************************

THE ATARI JAGUAR
----------------

{Not reprinted in full; only the most important points are brought up}

-Specs are impressive: 5 processors: RISC-Based GPU and DSP processors, an
Object Processor, BLITTER, and a 68000
-Base price (without CD) in the 200$ range
-CD ROM will be double-speed, need special cartridges to view Kodak Photo
CD, CD+G, and MPEG movies on CD.  Uses Cinepak as standard.
-Number of developpers as of September 1993: "more than ten" according to
Jack Tramiel, president of Atari.
-The Jaguar WILL contain a lock-out chip.  {???}
-The console is being built by IBM, simply because they were the company
that gave the best bid to Atari.
-Cartridge prices will probably range from 39$-69$
-Most software will be in the 4-16 meg range, with extensive use of
compression.
-Its 64-Bit architecture runs 100 megabytes per second
-The DSP boasts a 27 MIPS DSP with 8K of zero wait-state SRAM for CD stereo
audio.
-Offers 32-Bit color on NTSC and PAL sets.
-ROM cart capacity of upto 48Megs
-Special effects: texture mapping, morphing, warping of images, lighting
effects, transparency.
-According to Tramiel, the system has only 2 megs of RAM, and this could be
a problem down the road.
-This seems like a great machine, but as we speak, only Atari has written
games for this console; Tempest 2000, Trevor McFur, Raiden, Dino Dudes,
Tiny Toons, Aliens VS Predator, Club Drive, and CyberMorph.  Add a CD-ROM
reader, and you approach the 3DO system.

**************************************************************************

3DO has major financial partners: Electronic Arts (the world's largest
video games developer), Universal Studios, Matsushita (Japan's electronic
leader, maker of Panasonic), and some large American insurance firm.  So
basically, they have advertising power thru Universal Studios (Home Alone
character playing a 3DO system, perhaps?) and before movies begin;
Matsushita, which also has an enormous distribution network (every
audio-video store, your local K-Mart, you name it!); a company that
knows how to program games right, ECA; and an insurance company that can cope
with the legalities...  Here is what this wonderful mix can produce: thanks
to 3DO, gaming will never be the same again.

**************************************************************************

STALLONE'S FIRST GAME SHOOT
---------------------------

Long before The Man arrived, the soundstage at Mansfield Studios being used
by Virgin Games to shoot the live action sequences for the 3DO version of
Demolition Man was alive with activity.

Computer wizards and film production people mingled in apparent harmony,
the cameramen and directors setting up the stage while the techies hovered
over the incredible Ultimatte system which merges video images with
computer graphics.

Upstairs, lavish quarters were readied for the star to change wardrobe,
with a back room containing a spa for relaxing between scenes.  A
collection of costumes hung on a rack, including Stallone's police
officer's uniform.

It was the second day of shooting for Sylvester Stallone, who stars as
future cop John Spartan in the Joel Silver produced sci-fi film, Demolition
Man, on which the game is based.  Co-stars Wesley Snipes and Jesse "The
Body" Ventura had already filmed their parts, and everyone agreed that the
end results simply got exponentially better as shooting progressed.

"Joel Silver has just been incredibly cooperative," remarked Virgin sound
guru Tommy Tallarico.  "He furnished us with the specs and blueprints for
all the sets, and we 'built' them inside the computer."  He then ran a
quick demo showing several eye-popping scenes from the game, including the
Cryoprison and an amazing action sequence, taken from the film, in which
the player, as Spartan, clings to the roof of a speeding auto, firing at
targets as they race along.

On the first day of shooting, Sly had been apprehensive.  He was apparently
somewhat unhappy with the game version of his previous film, CliffHanger,
and expected to end up looking like a tiny, Mario-like sprite when all was
said and done.  One look at the astonishing Ultimatte technology, however,
and he was clearly impressed.  "I wish I'd had something like this when I
was making Rocky," he'd remarked.

By the time he arrived on Day Two, everything was in readiness.

"Let's rock and roll," someone called out.  "The Man's here."

Stallone was genial and good natured, heading immediately upstairs to
change into his art deco police uniform.  Meanwhile, the initial shots were
being blocked out using Stallone's long-time stunt double.  Everything was
being shot against a green backdrop, which the computer can remove more
easily than the traditional cobalt blue used in film-making.

Sly was on the set within minutes and the prop woman handed him the day's
first weapon.  For the next half dozen hours, Stallone endured take after
take on a cramped, increasingly warm sound stage.  Watching him on the
monitor, the quality of the images looked striking. Stallone's famous face
looked right at home on a computer screen, interacting with objects which
exist only as data in a computer's memory banks.

Between takes and costume changes, he would step behind the scenes to
observe the footage being generated and marvel at the computer's wizardry.

"Can it produce special effects?" he wanted to know.  "Can you do steam and
strobes and things like that?"

Assured that the system could generate such effects in addition to lighting
modifications,  he simply shook his head in amazement.  In fact, while the
3DO was billed as having the hardware capacity to reposition the lighting
on any image, it actually can only modify the lighting on the sprites.
"It's actually easier to darken a scene then lighten it," a technician
said, "so we actually shoot the scenes with lots of light.  But we can
re-light sprites, to create a muzzle flash after a gun is fired, for
example."

The movie is due in theaters this fall, but the game won't be available
until next year, due to the delay in obtaining a complete set of 3DO
development tools.

***********************************************************************

3DO: A PLACE TO GO
------------------

Never content to rest on its laurels - or admit that the ultimate
electronic football game will ever exist - Park Palace is involved in a
couple of next-generation pigskin sims for 3DO and the Atari Jaguar.

The 3DO Football game was shown to the industry at this summer's CES.  But,
as with many 3DO projects, its release date has been delayed.  The game was
originally set to launch in October, along with Panasonic's promised
rollout of its version of the 3DO hardware, but probably won't show up
until early '94.  Opinions vary on the reasons for the delay - as well as
the postponement of many other 3DO titles - but various non-disclosure
agreements keep most developers off-the-record on the subject.

It has been pointed out elsewhere, for example, that 3DO has been tardy in
getting out its promised development tools.  But Chris Whaley of Park
Palace has a somewhat different take:"Here's what I think happened.  First,
the 3DO is a very easy system to get up and running, and developers got
into the system very quickly.  Then, we all showed this great-looking stuff
at the CES and I think we scared ourselves.  Everybody thought they had the
most fantastic stuff, and when they saw that there was plenty of other
fantastic stuff, we kind of all went back to the drawing board to make sure
the stuff was as good as it possibly could be."

***********************************************************************

Crystal Dynamics' CRASH'N'BURN is bundled with Panasonic's REAL 3DO
Interactive Multiplayer during the 3DO unit's fall introduction.  The video
game, specifically designed for the 32-Bit system, evokes a futuristic
racing competition through a hostile 3-D environment in armed vehicles, and
comes complete with FMV, object scaling and rotating with texture-mapped
graphics and stereo sound.

{NOTE: I played the game; I fell on my *ss; it is absolutely AMAZING!!
Take the best driving game in the arcade, and it's not even up to the
standards of this game!!!!!}

***********************************************************************

NINTENDO AND SILICON GRAPHICS TEAM UP
-------------------------------------

Nintendo is teaming up with Silicon Graphics, widely recognized as the
world leader in visual computing technologies, to develop a
three-dimensional, 64-Bit Nintendo machine for home and arcade use.  Dubbed
"Project Reality", it will feature Reality Immersion Technology, a new
system that Nintendo promises will "enable players to enter inside
real-time, three-dimensional worlds." 

The product will roll-out into arcades in 1994, then should be available
for home use in late 1995.  The price is expected to be under 250$.

Although details of the proposed machine are sketchy, it will be based on
the MIPS/Multimedia Engine, a chip-set consisting of a 64-Bit MIPS RISC
microprocessor, graphics chips, and Application Specific Integrated
Circuits.  According to project spokesmen, the machine will have greater
than 100Mhz CPU clock speed, real-time 3D graphics, 24-Bit colour, high
resolution video, and CD quality audio.  It will generate more than 100,000
polygons per second, and more than 100 MIPS and over 100 MFLOPS.  It will
also use anti-aliased 3-D texture mapping in real-time.

{NOTE: I have introduced this as I think it is a real joke...  Already 3DO
does this, and the Atari Jaguar approaches the same specs.  Frankly, I
wouldn't want to wait so long for what will be old technology when it comes
out...  CD is the media of the future!}
{NOTE2: Nintendo has no intention of using CD as a media...  They say they
have better compression techniques.  So, how much more can they cram in?
At the MOST most, let's say 100megs.  CD-ROM is 560megs.  A CD costs a
couple of pennies to produce, compared to the electronics that need to be
produced for a cartridge, and the costs therefore are higher...}

************************************************************************

From AmiNet:
------------

But anyway... I heard today that the 3DO is out.  Reports have it that
Babbages is carrying it.  I'm going to have to head over there tomorrow
and check it out.  I sure hope the CD32 makes it out soon, so people can
see that a $400 unit can equal or surpass a $700 machine.  IF the thing is
marketed properly.  IF.  Let's all cross our fingers.  If it fails, I
guess we'll all be buying PC's in a year or so.  <shudder>


The next generation of video game wars is on!  The 3DO is officially out,
the CD32 is out in Europe, and due out anyday now in the US, and Atari's
Jaguar should be appearing in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and London
real soon now.

*************************************************************************


If the marketing of Commodore's and Atari's' entries are any good, the
3DO won't have a prayer.  How does a $699 machine compete with a $399
CD32 and $199 Jaguar ($399 after you add the optional CD ROM drive)?
Both Atari and Commodore have signed some good names to make games.
Interplay, a well-known game maker that had signed up for 3DO develop-
ment, took a look at the Jaguar and its developer documentation, and
quickly declared the Jaguar to be superior to 3DO in every respect.
Word has it that they may not even be a 3DO developer anymore.

While the CD32 isn't as advanced as Atari's 64-bit RISC-based Jaguar,
or Panasonic's 32-bit RISC-based 3DO, it has the advantage of (1) a
reasonable price, and (2) a standard CD ROM drive.  This means that it's
likely to be the machine of choice for MPEG movies.  Just add the optional
MPEG board, and you're ready to watch all those movies that are being
ported to the compact disc format.  I think owners of laser disc players
are going to be upset when their format is abandoned in another year or
so.

Interactive CD Player Wars Begin

SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA -- The Interactive compact disc (CD)-player wars have 
begun. 3DO reports Matsushita's subsidiary, Panasonic, is placing its Real 
brand 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in stores beginning this month. Company 
representatives said Panasonic will not talk numbers, but claims it can have 
multiplayers in 2,000 retail stores by Christmas. 

The players connect to a television set, retail for $699.95, and have been
dubbed the new video cassette recorders (VCRs) of the 90's. The Real 3DO
players come with two CDs - one containing the Electronic Arts game "Crash and
Burn," and the other offering information about the system and previews of
software titles that will soon be available. 

Eight titles for the player are expected to be available by the end of October,
and a total of 27 titles from 13 companies are projected to be available in
time for the holiday season. 

Sanctuary Woods says it is shipping the first shrink-wrapped title for the 3DO,
"Shelley Duvall's It's A Bird's Life," retail priced at $54.95. Panasonic says
the titles will range in price from $40 to $60 each. 

Television advertising campaigns and nation wide mall tours in seven major
cities are getting underway to promote the Real players, Panasonic
representatives said. Mall tours offer about 15 3DO units set up with games for
mall shoppers to visit and play as long as they like. In Los Angeles, Panasonic
will offer the only mall tour at two malls on the same weekend,  October 16-17.
One will be at the Del Amo Mall and the other at the Los Ceritos Mall. 

Philips has the jump on Panasonic as its Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I)
players have been in retail stores since last year. The company has started
airing "infomercials" on national television to educate consumers concerning
the units. 

Besides over $150 game and educational titles, the company is offering digital
movies on CD beginning this month in a deal with Paramount. Nine movie titles
will be offered including Top Gun, Black Rain, Fatal Attraction, and Star Trek
VI. Music videos will also be available, Philips representatives said. 

Philips has also dropped the price of its player down to $499, but the catch is
a $250 MPEG Digital Video cartridge (which offers Motion Picture Experts Group
decompression) must be added to the CD-I unit in order to play back the
compressed movies. 

Both the Panasonic Real 3DO and the CD-I player boast playback capability of
audio CDs and Kodak photo CDs. 

************************************************************************


    ANOTHER VIDEO GAME CONTENDER - It is rumored that 3DO Co. will soon 
 move into the video game market.  Sources say that 3DO's Interactive 
 Multiplayer unit is, "faster and more powerful than game machines now on 
 the market". Much attention has been focused on the 3DO system "because 
 of its ability to combine video, audio, text and graphics."
  
    One problem that the 3DO system has to overcome is the few games that 
 will be available for it through Christmas.  Sources say that "customer 
 decisions on machine purchases usually are based on what games can be 
 played on those machines ... and so far, the software selection for 3DO 
 is slim."
  
    The manufacturer says 10 to 20 games will be available for Christmas 
 sales, though more than 150 games are under development.

/// Atari's Jaguar steals 3DO's Thunder on CBS This Morning
    -------------------------------------------------------    
    By Travis Guy


                Reprinted from AEO News #1, October 8, 1993


Finally breaking loose from its well crafted veil of mystery, the Atari
Jaguar made its national television debut early today on the CBS news
program CBS This Morning. Placed squarely in competition with the 3DO
system, Atari's new machine looked to be in good shape in the battle of
the next generation videogame systems.

For those who couldn't see the CBS This Morning piece, the Jag played
second fiddle to the 3DO... in terms of placement and air time only. Herb
Weisbaum, consumer reporter for KIRO-TV, Seattle, opened his three and a
half minute live report with a Panasonic REAL 3DO Multiplayer at his side,
telling viewers only that there were two new video game machines coming to
market. "Both are better than anything that's ever come before."

3DO was presented as a 32-bit machine that relies on CDs to deliver action
and realism. Lots of footage of Crash and Burn, the Panasonic player's
pack-in game, played throughout the 3DO segment, interspersed with
snippets from other 3DO games. Ken Williams, President of Sierra On-Line
said of 3DO, "It's got the horsepower to deliver the games we always
dreamed about."

3DO CEO Trip Hawkins demoed PGA Tour Golf, saying it has, "The look and
feel of a TV broadcast." Kirkland, Washington's Boy Scout troop 616 was
given an opportunity to play with a 3DO machine - the comments from the
Scouts ranged from, "It's cool" to "A lot better than Super Nintendo and
Genesis."

Weisbaum warned, "Right now, 3DO stands alone. But not for long."
Suddenly, the familiar Fuji and the ATARI logo appeared on screen -
Atari's first direct mention.

The Jaguar was presented as "an even more powerful system," a 64-bit
machine to sell for "just 250 dollars", and to which a $200 CD-ROM can be
added. The Jaguar, a controller, and a CD-ROM unit attached to another
Jaguar - all sitting in front of a Jaguar shipping box - were displayed.

Cuts from Crescent Galaxy, Cybermorph and Raiden were shown being played:
"The first time Jaguar software has been seen on TV. The games are
colorful, fast-paced, with lots of action."

Atari President Sam Tramiel said, "I love shoot'em up games. That's what
people like to play.... The big thing is to have a lot of fun with your
software. That's the key."

Glenn Rubenstein, a videogame reviewer for the San Francisco Examiner, was
seen having been given some time to spend with a Jaguar. "For 250 dollars,
I'm very impressed with the Jaguar." Rubenstein laughed, "I would actually
spend my own money. Not a lot of journalists would say that about a
product, but I would actually go out and buy a Jaguar."

Weisbaum closed his report on Atari by saying Rubenstein would have to
wait until November for the Jaguar's San Francisco and New York rollout,
with national distribution coming in 1994.

He then pointed out that 3DO is going to the stores now. For $700. CBS
This Morning anchor Harry Smith asked Weisbaum, "Who's going to pay that?"

Weisbaum answered, "They [3DO] say people will for brand new technology."

He also added that the machines (both 3DO and Jaguar) will be able to
connect to digital networks to enable players to play games linked across
the country.

Harry Smith neatly summed up the segment, "Hot stuff, Herb."

Notes:

////  From the background I was given, CBS was planning a story on 3DO,
when they heard about Atari's Jaguar. After spending 4 hours at Atari on
Tuesday, they felt that it was worthy to include it in their story.

////  The Atari logo and Fuji shown in the broadcast should be part of
what appears when you power up a Jaguar without a cartridge or CD-ROM
installed.

////  I reached Herb Weisbaum later in the day by phone, and asked him
what were his personal impressions on both machines. He declined to take a
stand on that, saying, "At this moment, I have trouble playing Pong."

////  Atari Corp. also confirmed via phone that the Atari Jaguar will
retail for $249. This includes one controller and one pack-in game.

////  CBS This Morning airs weekdays on most CBS stations from 7am to 9am
(Eastern and Pacific times) and 6am to 8am (Central time).

           » Multimedia Expo - Analyzing The Games Industry «

At the "Analyzing the Games Industry - Investment and Return" session at the 
Multimedia Expo in San Jose, one of the featured speakers was Volpe Welty's 
Lee Isgur.

Isgur  identified Nintendo as the dominant player in the video game industry 
in terms of installed base and hardware.  However, he said that in terms of 
sales, the "8-bit machine is faltering very badly," but the "16-bit will do 
better in sales than last year."  He also said that, "Game-Boy is, at the 
moment, the leading portable platform."

He predicated that there would be 83 million units of software sales 
domestically this year.

He noted that Sega has been outselling Nintendo in the last few weeks in the 
US, in terms of new hardware and software sales.  However, he said he did not 
know if that would continue into the Christmas season.

He identified CD's as becoming the dominant factor in the industry in 
terms of software during the 1995-1997 period.

Interestingly, he said that which media the game industry uses will dictate 
where it goes. He maintained that the current cartridge industry is fairly 
expensive, and expects a shift to something else - such as flash cards or 
CD-ROMs.  He also said that the current hardware "is lousy," with no flat 
screens, no great colors.

        Commodore, the company that once dominated the home computer-market
in the United States only to let that position slip through its circuits, has
quietly introduced a remarkable home-entertainment device that could take the
country by storm - or languish on store shelves.
        It could go either way for teh CD32 because Commodore can't - or
won't - spend more than pocket change to promote the device.

       ** 3DO Interactive Multiplayer System Gains Major Supporter **

    The 3DO Company this week gained the support Macromedia, a leader in
 multi-media software tools.  Macromedia announced it had entered into an
 agreement to develop a software player that will allow Director Windows
 or Macintosh files to port easily and quickly to the 3DO Interactive
 Multiplayer system.

    This agreement makes it possible for Macromedia Director developers to
 seamlessly port applications to a leading consumer platform. Titles
 created with Director can currently be distributed on Macintosh and
 Windows platforms. With the Director Player for 3DO, developers focused
 on the Macintosh and Windows platforms can now deliver titles to a wider
 consumer audience.

   "Our agreement with 3DO represents our strategic commitment to provide
 our multimedia playback technology on the leading consumer platforms,"
 said John C. (Bud) Colligan, president and chief executive officer at
 Macromedia. "We believe the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system will be an
 important consumer standard."

    This agreement extends Macromedia's strategy to offer developers
 platform optimization rather than forcing them to develop on the lowest
 common denominator. The Director Player for 3DO will provide developers
 with special extensions that optimize titles to take advantage of the
 unique features of the 3DO platform.

   "The Director Player for 3DO is the next step in providing a rich
 authoring platform to 3DO developers," said Bill Duvall, senior vice
 president of software at The 3DO Company. "The Director Player for 3DO,
 along with the other multimedia development tools that Macromedia and 3DO
 are delivering to developers, ensures that the 3DO Interactive
 Multiplayer environment will have a wide selection of software titles."

   "For multimedia title developers to be successful and competitive, they
 need to both decrease their development time and optimize their titles
 for target platforms," said Larry Miller, vice president of marketing at
 Macromedia. "With our Player for Windows and now the Player for 3DO, the
 world's largest installed base of multimedia developers will be able to
 do just that."

    The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system attaches to a television set
 and delivers 50 times the graphics animation performance of PCs and video
 game systems. The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system plays interactive
 entertainment, education and information software, as well as music CDs,
 photo CDs and motion CDs. Designed to be a worldwide standard like VHS,
 the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer is available in a CD-based version from
 Panasonic under the name FZ-1 REAL(TM) 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.

                       3DO, SET WITH SET-TOP BOX

California computer graphics company 3DO made a big jump into television
last week, signing on to build equipment for US West's video dialtone
test in Omaha. US West tapped 3DO to design the set-top converter boxes
for the proposed test, which still is awaiting FCC approval. The set-top
box will be the subscribers interface for a variety of planned inter-
active services, including games, video on demand and home shopping.

The news is a boost to 3DO, a relative newcomer to the industry. Until
now, 3DO has concentrated primarily on developing a CD-based graphics
system called Interactive Multiplayer. The new interactive box will be
based on the Multiplayer, which hit stores last week. Unlike many other
computer companies, 3DO does no manufacturing on its own. Instead, it
develops and licenses the animation and graphics system. The first
Multiplayer, for example, is made by Panasonic, and, 3DO says, more
than 400 companies have signed to develop 151 software titles for the
system.

3DO chief operating officer, Hugh Martin, says that the CD titles will
be available to US West to provide a pool of interactive material for
the test. He says other interactive TV tests, including Time Warner's
Orlando test, may suffer from a lack of consumer-tested interactive
material. The early CD offerings will include video games, simulators
and family games that are similar to software available for home
computers.

US West has not designated a manufacturer for the new box, nor has it
chosen the exact format for the electronic program guide that will
allow a subscriber to navigate through the available services. Since
many particulars of the box are uncertain, it is not yet possible to
determine how much the units will cost per home, Martin says. The basic
circuitry is the same as the CD-based system, but since it can operate
without the costliest component, the CD drive, it will likely be less
expensive. He warns, however, that the set-top box will require various
cable hardware not included in the Multiplayer, driving costs back up.

              ** Sega to Create "Next Generation Video Game" **

    Sega Enterprises is attempting to steal a march on rival Nintendo by
 developing a 64-bit video game machine - nicknamed the "Saturn" - and
 getting it to market by the fall of 1994.  Nindendo's 64-bit offering
 isn't expected to reach market until 1995.

    Reportedly the "Saturn" will be equipped with dual processors.  One
 will be Hitachi's 64-bit processor and the other a 32-bit processor. The
 64-bit processor will be used to produce high quality screen movement, as
 well as voice and sound features. It is claimed that the picture can be
 three-dimensional and highly realistic.

    Sega will set up a software development center, called the "Creative
 Center", in Shibuya, Tokyo, to start creating software for its new game
 system.  Besides that, Sega is also planning to set up a software
 development studio, called "Multimedia Studio," next April. At the
 studio, Sega wants to create advanced software incorporating video and
 sound technologies. Movie producers, broadcasting firms and music
 companies will participate in the project. Sega has reportedly already
 signed deals with movie and broadcasting firms.

                   » 3DO Int'l Assn, 3DO Club Started «


REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 NOV 2 (NB) -- 3DO has started two 
support groups, one for people in businesses related to 3DO technology, the 
3DO International Association (3DOIA), and the 3DO Club for consumers.  The 
compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM)-based 3DO hardware was shipped into 
retail outlets by Panasonic in September.

Panasonic, the only hardware manufacturer currently offering the 3DO player, 
says sales of the Real 3DO are going very well, despite the fact that there 
are only three software titles for the player to date. The 3DO boasts a 
reduced instruction set computing (RISC) chip, is specially designed to offer 
fast graphics rendering, and connects to a television set. The unit will also 
play audio CDs and Kodak Photo CDs.

Twenty more entertainment titles are expected by Christmas and in excess of 
300 developers have signed up to either move existing software titles or 
create new ones for the 3DO market.

The 3DOIA is $95 per year and is aimed at developers, publishers, producers, 
dealers, distributors, and manufacturers of 3DO products. The group has been 
formed to offer a forum and information about 3DO as well as information 
exchange between members and will offer a newsletter, special interest groups
(SIGS), and conferences.

The 3DO Club is the source for fun information aimed at consumers or would-be 
consumers who are willing to spend $19.95 per year to learn more about 3DO. 
Members can expect a quarterly newsletter with information about new 3DO 
products, behind-the-scenes previews, and profiles of those who have licensed 
3DO's technology. Contests, special events, and sweepstakes will also be a 
part of the club, 3DO added.

To entice membership, those purchasing Panasonic 3DO systems now will receive 
free one-year memberships and a sweepstakes with a grand price of an all-
expense-paid trip to Universal Studios is also being offered. Ten first prizes 
of 3DO software titles will be awarded as well, the company said.

Those interested in joining 3DOIA are encouraged to call 3DO for more 
information. Information on the 3DO Club may be obtained by mail. Janet 
Strauss, director of marketing for 3DO said the company has already received 
thousands of letters from people who want to joint the 3DO Club.

3DO has as its largest competitor Philips with the Compact Disc Interactive 
(CD-I) player. Philips has announced a deal with Paramount to introduce 
72-minute movies for the CD-I player that will play with the addition of 
special Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) hardware module for decompression 
of the video. The company recently cut the price of the CD-I player so
with the MPEG module it is comparable to the 3DO price of about $700. Philips 
is also doing "infomercials" on national television and has more game titles 
available as it has been marketing the CD-I player for over a year. However, 
3DO claims other game systems are no match for the graphics capability of
its system.

One other player in this market could be the Atari Jaguar system. While Atari 
officials hope the Jaguar will be as popular as the now ancient Commodore 64 
home computer, the company has lost nearly all its momentum in the US market 
and is struggling to manufacture the Jaguar systems in large enough quantities 
to meet demand. However, Atari does have backing from C-Cube, a maker of video 
compression hardware chips.

From AmiNet:
------------

Hey everybody. Just thought I'd let you know that the November issue of
Computer Gaming World has an article on the CD32. The article speaks highly of
the CD32 in comparison to Atari's Jaguar and the 3DO. But the author of the
article said some pretty rough stuff about C= marketing tactics. (Not that I
blame him of course.) He described their plan as "of stealth-like, atrophic
advertising).  But he still gives C= a chance to capture a "lion's share of
the 32-bit and beyond console game market". Quoting him again, "It's (the
CD32) is certainly the most cost effective alternative at present, and the
most expandable console device to arrive thus far." The article even gives
C='s address and phone #. (215)431-9100 for perspective buyers to call.

Also covered in the magazine were articles on the Jaguar and 3DO. According to
the article, the basic Jaguar system will be catridge based and sell for
around $200. But I saw a mail order add for it at $257. The CD-ROM drive will
cost an additonal estimated (it wasn't out at the time of the article) $200.
The Jaguar allows up to six megabytes of code per ROM cartridge. Cartridges
will cost from $39 and $69 bucks. Since the CD unit isn't out for the Jaguar
yet, I'd say this really sucks. The article shows a picture of the basic unit
and I don't like the way it looks. (Of course I'm biased as heck.) There will
be five (yes count them five) whole games availible at launch. All cartridge
games of course.

The 3DO looks like a black box with one port for a control pad. The control
pads are supposed to be daisy chainable, but if that's true, then the control
pad that comes with the 3DO will have to be at the end of the chain because it
doesn't have a pass-thru. The 3DO has no expansion module but one is promised
for the future (with an additional cost of course) from Matsushita sometime in
the middle of '94. The 3DO is exclusively CD and no price was given for it.


To finish, the article for the CD32 stated that C='s Amiga CD32 is the first
"32-bit game console advailible to consumers, and the only one currently
employing a double-speed CD-ROM drive. Retailing for $399, the Amiga CD32 also
debuts several hundred dollars below the 3DO and the Jaguar with the CD
drive."

TOP PRIORITY:

A quote taken from comp.sys.amiga.emulators, from emulation's newest 
bestest buddy, Jim Drew.

"We are looking into the licensing agreement for the chipset used in the 
3DO emulation."


WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT:

The quote's context was in reference to the CD32 only.  However, I can 
easily see them trying to extend this to CD-equipped Amigas.


WHAT THIS MEANS:

This means that, depending on the cost of the 3DO Emplant module, a 
consumer could very well be able to buy both a CD32 AND a 3DO for 
around the price of 3DO itself.  Now, the challenge would be to 
communicate that to the public.

Well there it was...  The complete (???) guide to the 32/64 bits console
battle.  There is a wealth of information out there on the 3DO, compared 
to the other systems mentionned, which is primarily why this seems to be 
our primary issue.

My experience ranges from Atari VCS, Sinclair ZX81, Sinclair Spectrum,
Nintendo console and Sega console, Atari 600XL, Atari 1040ST, Amiga 500, 
Amiga 3000/25, Amiga 1200/030-50, and I've worked extensively on the 
TI 99/4A, ColecoVision and Adams, PC 386's, Macintosh Classic/IIfx, 
VAX and Unix workstations.  Yes, I do change computers often  :)

So, basically, I've been searching for the ultimate games machine, and what
will give me the best for my hard earned money.

JAGUAR: I would have opted for the Jaguar, but these reasons block me: 
cartridges are quite limited in size; the optional CD module which would 
make this machine truly amazing is not out, and NOT AS STANDARD.  From 
experience, I know it will take some time before it is supported... ; 
the lack of software support: you might have the most advanced machine 
in the world, but if support is lacking...

The CD32: cheap & cheerful; but there is also a lack of support (both in
software although not as harsh as Jaguar's, and in marketing); the machine
is not fast enough to handle 640x480 HAM8 mode (pseudo 256 000 colors 
mode), which holds restrictions, so basically you will have 256 colors 
games with some static HAM8 pictures, in 320x200 (256 Europe).  Technically
it doesn't have much astounding coprocessors for texture mapping, and the
68020 at 14mhz is fairly weak to handle such a job at a high frame rate;
the 3DO in its first games handles around 24 frames per second in high
resolution 24bit mode due to graphic coprocessors and a powerful RISC CPU.
And remember that the games are written in C language!  The first batch of
CD32 games are rated average (and, programmers KNOW the machine, they've
been programming Amiga ECS machines for 9 years and AGA for 2 years!),
compared to the 3DO which is a brand new system, and already the games are
diabolical...

SEGA's Saturn: From what I had read in a comparison of the CD systems soon
to be on the market, the new Sega system is still not a match to the 
3DO CD-Rom system, which they found was a shame.  It is just a small notch
above their current 16-bit Genesis with CD-Rom.  Sega does possess the
technology to do better (if you look at what they produce in arcades), so
this one is a definite disappointment.

NINTENDO Project Reality: Well, it WILL be awesome; from what I could read,
it will basically be a Silicon Graphics Indy graphics chip set modified,
and a powerful RISC CPU.  But, the big downer is: consumer availability in
1995 (read 1996 or more...), and still the use of cartridge.

3DO: The 3DO system, for me, is the clear winner, but the price is 
astounding, so I will wait until it is lowered (which WILL be happening 
quite soon); I will be taking Sanyo's 3DO as I believe it should be cheaper 
(just as Sanyo stereos are cheaper than Panasonic, but this time, the 
technology is the same...), and I will buy mail-order to still lower the 
cost.  It should be down to around $550.  That is still quite expensive, 
but you get a CD player and a Photo-CD player at the same time...  
So, $550 compared to a $400 CD32, and a $500 Jaguar CD system, and it holds
up quite nicely.  Especially that software support is tremendous, and the
marketing power is remarkable.

One thing with 3DO that is clear is that it's not just a games machine, and
the diversity of its upcoming titles clearly shows this.  From
encyclopedias to children interactive singalongs to sports coaching
software to FMV thrill experiences (like a simulation of deep sea diving),
as well as its upcoming 3DO Entertainment Channel, it will be something
big.  It started as a vision, and it will change our lives.  There is no
doubt in my mind, just by looking at the marketing powers behind it.  But
please!  Just lower the price!!!
