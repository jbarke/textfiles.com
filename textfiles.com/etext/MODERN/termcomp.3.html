                    Chapter 15

     Sunday,   December 6
     Washington, D.C.

Miles  Foster  was busy at one of the several  computers  in  his 
Washington,  D.C. condo.  It was necessary, on a daily basis,  to 
stay  in contact with a vast group of people who  were  executing 
portions of his master plan.  He thought it was going quite well, 
exceedingly  so  in  fact.  Spread over 3  continents  he  remote 
controlled  engineers  and programmers who  designed  methods  to 
compromise computers.  With his guidance, though.  He broke  them 
into  several groups, and none of them knew they were part  of  a 
much  larger  organization, nor did they have any idea  of  their 
ultimate objective.

Each of his computer criminals was recruited by Alex; that's  the 
only  name that Miles knew. Alex.  Miles had drawn up a  list  of 
minimum  qualifications  for his 'staff'.  He forwarded  them  to 
Homosoto,  who, Miles guessed, passed them on to  the  ubiquitous 
yet  invisible  Alex.  That obviously wasn't his real  name,  but 
suitable for conversation.  

Miles had developed a profile of the various talents he required.  
One  group  needed to have excellent programming skills,  with  a 
broad  range  of expertise in operating  systems.   An  operating 
system is much like English or any other language.  It is the O/S 
that  allows  the computer to execute its commands.   Unless  the 
computer  understands  the  O/S, the computer is  deaf  dumb  and 
blind.   As a child learns to communicate, a computer  is  imbued 
with  the basic knowledge to permit it to function.  It is  still 
essentially  stupid,  that is, it can't do anything  on  its  own 
without  instructions, but it can understand them when  they  are 
given.

In  order to violate a computer, a thorough understanding of  the 
O/S,  or  language of the computer is a must.   Good  programmers 
learn  the  most efficient way to get a computer to  perform  the 
desired  task. There are, as in any field, tricks of  the  trade.  
Through  experience,  a  programmer will learn how  to  fool  the 
computer  into doing things  it might not be designed to do.   By 
taking advantage of the features of the Operating System, many of 
them unknown and therefore undocumented by the original designers 
of  the O/S, a computer programmer is able to extract  additional 
performance from the equipment.

Similarly, though, such knowledge allows the motivated programmer 
to  bypass critical portions of the Operating System  to  perform 
specific jobs and to circumvent any security measures that may be 
present.   For example, in most of the 85,000,000 or so DOS  com-
puters in the world, it is common knowledge that when you ERASE a 
file,  you really don't erase it.  You merely erase the  NAME  of 
the file.  If a secretary was told to dispose of document from  a 
file  cabinet, and she only removed the name of each   file,  but 
left  the contents remaining in the file drawers, she would  cer-
tainly  have reason to worry for her job.  Such is an example  of 
one of the countless security holes that permeate computer land.

To  take  advantage of such glaring omissions,  several  software 
companies  were  formed that allowed users to  retrieve  'erased' 
files.

These were among the skills that Miles wanted his people to have.  
He  needed  them to be fluent in not only DOS, but  Unix,  Xenix, 
VMS,  Mac  and a host of other Operating Systems.   He  needed  a 
group  that knew the strengths and weaknesses of every major  O/S 
to  fulfill his mission.  They needed to be able to identify  and 
exploit  the trap doors and holes in all operating  and  security 
systems.  From an engineering standpoint, Miles found it terrifi-
cally  exciting.   Over the three years he had been  working  for 
Homosoto,  Miles  and his crew designed software  techniques  and 
hardware  tools that he didn't believe were even contemplated  by 
his former employer, the NSA.

The  qualifications he sent to Homosoto were extensive,  detailed 
and  demanding.  Miles wasn't convinced that anyone but he  could 
find the proper people.  The interview process alone was  crucial 
to  determining  an applicant's true abilities,  and  a  mediocre 
programmer could easily fool a non-technical person.  While Miles 
and Homosoto agreed that all programmers should be isolated  from 
each  other, Miles felt he should know them more than by a  coded 
name  over  modem lines.  Miles lost that battle with  one  swift 
word from Homosoto. No.  

To Miles' surprise, within a few days of providing Homosoto  with 
is  recruitment lists, his 'staff' began calling him on his  com-
puter.   To  call Miles, a computer needed his  number,  and  the 
proper  security codes.  To a man, or woman, they all did.   And, 
as  he  spoke to them over the public phone lines,  in  encrypted 
form  of  course,  he was amazed at their quality  and  level  of 
technical  sophistication.   Whoever Alex was, he knew how to  do 
his job.

Over  a period of a few months, Miles commanded the resources  of 
over  100 programmers.  But, Miles thought, there  was  something 
strange  about  most of those with whom he  spoke.   They  seemed 
ready  to  blindly follow instructions  without  questioning  the 
assigned tasks.  When a programmer takes a job or an  assignment, 
he  usually knows that he will be designing a data base, or  word 
processor  or other application program.  However,  Miles'  staff 
was to design programs intended to damage computers.  

He  had  assembed the single largest virus software team  in  the 
world,  and none of them questioned the nature or ethics  of  the 
work.  Miles would have thought that while there  is considerable 
technical  talent around the world, finding people who  would  be 
willing  to  work on projects to facilitate the  interruption  of 
communications and proper computer operations would have been the 
most  difficult part of recruitment.  He realized he  was  wrong, 
although he did not know why.  Technical mercenaries perhaps?  He 
had  never  seen an ad with that as a job title,  but,  what  the 
hell.   Money can buy anything.  Weapons designers  since  Oppen-
heiner  have had to face similar moral dilemmas, and  with  wide-
spread hatred of things American, recruitment couldn't have  been 
all that difficult. 

As  he  sat in his apartment, he was receiving the  latest  virus 
designs  from one of his programmers who lived in the suburbs  of 
Paris,  France.  While there was somewhat of a  language  barrier 
when they spoke, the computer language was a common  denominator, 
and  they all spoke that fluently.  It broke down  communications 
errors.  Either it was in the code, or it wasn't.

Miles  knew  this  designer only as Claude.  Claude's  virus  was 
small, less than 2K, or 2000 characters, but quite deadly.  Miles 
went  over it and saw what it was designed to do.   Ooh,  clever, 
thought  Miles.  As many viruses do, this one attached itself  to 
the  Command.Com file of the DOS Operating System.   Rather  than 
wait  for a specific future date, the next time the computer  was 
booted, or turned on, Claude's virus in the O/S would play  havoc 
with  the  chips  that permit a printer to be  connected  to  the 
computer.  In a matter of seconds, with no pre-warning, the  user 
would  hear  a small fizzle, and smell the recognizable  odor  of 
electronic burn.  During the time the user poked his nose  around 
the  computer,  to see if the smell was real  or  imaginary,  the 
virus would destroy the contents of the hard disk.

According  to Claude, whose English was better than most  French-
men, there was a psychological advantage to this type of  double-
duty  virus.  The victim would realize that his  computer  needed 
repair  and  take it be fixed at his local computer  shop.   But, 
alas! Upon its return, the owner would find his hard disk trashed 
and attempt to blame the repairman.  Deviously clever.  Of course 
this type of virus would be discovered before too long.  After  a 
few  thousand  computers had their printer port  blown  up,  word 
would  get around and the virus would be identified.  But,  mean-
while, oh what fun. 

As Miles prepared to send Claude's latest and greatest to another 
of  his staff for analysis and debugging, the computer  dedicated 
to  speaking to Homosoto beeped at him.  He glanced over at  Nip-
Com.   He labeled all his computers with abbreviations.  In  this 
case, Nippon Communications seemed appropriate.

MR. FOSTER

Miles  scooted his chair over to NipCom and entered his  PRG  re-
sponse..

Here Boss-san.  What's up

YOU TELL ME.

Huh?

I READ THE PAPERS.  AGAIN YOU MOVE PRECIPITOUSLY.

What are you talking about?

FIRST STATE BANK.  YOUR INFECTORS ARE WITHOUT DISCIPLINE

I still don't know what you mean

THE PAPERS HAVE SAID THAT FIRST STATE BANK WAS INVADED BY HACKERS 
AND THEIR STOCK DROPPED VERY MUCH.  IT IS STILL NOT TIME.

Oh, that.  Good bit of work.

NO SO MR FOSTER.  I AM NOT PLEASED WITH YOU

Me, why?  I didn't have anything to do with it

EXPLAIN

Nothing  to explain.  My group doesn't do that, and even if  they 
did, so what. 

WHAT ABOUT THE VIRUSES?  I READ EVERY DAY OF NEW COMPUTER  VIRUS.  
THEY MUST BE STOPPED.

Why?  It's all in good fun.  Let 'em release them all they want.

THEY WILL HURT OUR PLANS

Bull.  If anything, they help us.

HOW IS THAT?

Getting folks good and nervous.  They're beginning to  wonder who 
they can trust. It sure as hell won't be the government. 

BUT IT IS IN THE PAPERS.

So?

THE  BANKS  WILL  PROTECT THEMSELVES.  THEY WILL  SEEN  WHAT  THE 
HACKERS DO AND MAKE OUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT.

Not  a  chance.  Listen, there are hundreds, maybe  thousands  or 
more  of  small time hackers who poke around  computers  all  the 
time.   Sometimes they do some damage, but most of the time  they 
are  in  it  for the thrill.  The challenge.   They  are  loosely 
organized at best.  Maybe a few students at a university, or high 
school  who  fancy themselves computer criminals.  Most  of  them 
wouldn't know what to do with the information if they took it.

The only reason this one hit the papers is because First is under 
investigation  anyway, some fraud stuff.  Literally thousands  of 
computers  are attacked every day, yet those don't appear in  the 
paper  or TV.  It's kind of like rape.  Companies don't  want  to 
admit they've been violated.  And since damage has been  limited, 
at least as far as the scale upon which we function, it's a  non- 
issue.  I DO NOT SEE IT THAT WAY.

Well,  that's the way it is.  There are maybe a half  dozen  well 
coordinated hacking groups who care to cause damage.  The rest of 
them, ignore them.  They're harmless.

I WISH I BELIEVED THAT

There's not much we can do about it.

WHY NOT STOP THEM

We  can't.   Look at our plans.  We have hundreds of  people  who 
have a single purpose. We operate as a single entity.  The  hack-
ers  are only a small thorn.  Industry can't do much about  them, 
so they ignore them.  It is better that we ignore them, too.

FIND THEM

Who?

THE FIRST BANK ATTACKERS

Why?

I WANT THEM STOPPED

I told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.  Call the Arab.

LOOK AT US, MR FOSTER.  NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

What do you want me to do with them?

TELL ME WHO THEY ARE.  I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

I'll see what I can do. 

DO IT.

     <<<<<<CONNECTION  TERMINATED>>>>>>

Fuck, thought Miles.  Sometimes Homosoto can be such an  asshole.  
He doesn't really understand this business.  I wonder how he  got 
into it in the first place.  

He remembered that he had to get Claude's virus properly analyzed 
and tested, so he sent it off to an American programmer who would 
perform  a  sanity-check on it.  If all went well he  would  then 
send it out for distribution into America's computers through his 
BBS system set up just for that purpose.

With  Diet  Coke and Benson and Hedges Ultra Lights  in  hand  he 
figured he might as well have someone look into Homosoto's  para-
noia.   With  some luck they could get a lead on  this  anonymous 
hacker and maybe Homosoto would leave him alone for a few  hours.  
The  constant interruptions and micro-management was a  perpetual 
pain in the ass. 

Miles  moved over to his BBS computer and told ProCom to dial  1- 
602-555-3490.   That  was the phone number of  the  Freedom  BBS, 
established  by Miles and several recruits that Alex had so  ably 
located.   It  was mid morning Arizona time.   Revere  should  be 
there.

GOOD.  SURPRISES THE SHIT OUT OF ME EVERY TIME THIS WORKS.  

Me too.  

WHAT CAN I DO?  GOT ANOTHER PRESENT?

Couple  of days, sure.  Some doosies.

WHAT'YA GOT?

A  graphics program that kicks the living shit out of VGA  Master 
and Paint Man. Deadly too.

HOW?

Copies portions of itself into Video RAM and treats it as a  TSR.  
Next  program you load gets infected from Video RAM  and  spreads 
from there.  Undetectable unless you're running debug at the same 
time and looking for it.  Then it stealths itself into all  V-RAM 
applications and spreads outside the O/S.  

TRIGGERS? 

I  forget  the  exact trigger mechanism, but  it  gives  constant 
parity errors.  Nothing'll run.

OK!  LOOKIN' GOOD.

Also have a few Lotus utilities, a couple of games.

THE GAMES ARE GOING GREAT GUNS. WE SHOULD BE SELLING THEM IN  THE 
STORES.

How many? 

AS  OF A WEEK AGO, MORE THAN 240,000 PACK-LADIES HAVE  BEEN  DOWN 
LOADED.  THAT'S OUR BEST SELLER.

Anyone sending money?

SURPRISINGLY, YES.  WE'RE TURNING A PROFIT.

Shit.  That's not what we wanted.

CAN'T KEEP A GOOD PROGRAM DOWN.

Yeah Yeah Yeah.  Need some info.

THAT'S OUR MIDDLE NAME.  WHAT  DO YOU NEED?

You hear about the First Bank hacker?

SURE!  I GOT A DOZEN PEOPLE TAKING CREDIT FOR IT.

You're kidding

NO!  IT'S  A GOOD ONE.  BRING A BANK TO IT'S KNEES.   STOP  STOCK 
TRADING.  SEC INVESTIGATION.  A LOT OF OUR FOLKS WOULD HAVE  BEEN 
PROUD.

Was it us?

NO WAY.

Then who, really?

DAMNED IF I KNOW OR CARE.

Care

WHAT? SINCE WHEN DO WE CARE ABOUT THE AMATEURS?

Since  now.  Things are heating up too soon.  I need to know  who 
pulled the job.

I CAN GET A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I CAN'T VERIFY IT.

Whoever did it is not likely to advertise it openly.  We may need 
to pull him into the open.

GOTCHA

Here's my thinking.  Assume the hack is just a kid.  He's getting 
no  credit and receives a shitty allowance.  So, we offer  a  re-
ward.   Whoever can prove that they are the one's who broke  into 
First Bank, we'll send them a new 386.  Whatever, use your imagi-
nation.

THINK HE'LL BITE?

If  it's a pro, no.  But this doesn't ring of a pro.   The  news-
papers know too much.  

AND IF WE FIND HIM?

Just  get me his number and shipping address.  Make sure he  gets 
the computer too.  

OK BOSS.  ANYTHING ELSE?

Keep up the good work.  Oh, yeah.  I need the estimates.

NO  PROBLEM.   THEY LOOK GREAT.  IN JUST OVER 2  YEARS,  WE  HAVE 
GIVEN  AWAY OVER 1,300,000 INFECTED PROGRAMS AND NONE  HAVE  GONE 
OFF YET.  ACCORDING TO PLAN.

Love it.  Peace.

BYE, YOU MF.

     Monday, December 7
     New York City

The phone on Scott Mason's desk had been unusually, but grateful-
ly quiet.  Higgins had been able to keep the First State  lawyers 
at  bay with the mounds of information the paper had  accumulated 
on  MacMillan's doings.  The bank's stock was trading again,  but 
at a dilution of over 75%.  Most individual customers had  cashed 
out  their accounts, including Higgins, and only those long  term 
portfolios  remained.  Scott's stories on First Bank had won  him 
recognition by his peers.  No awards, but an accolade at the  New 
York Journalists Club dinner.  Not bad, he thought.

Now the hard work continued for him.  The full background  analy-
ses, additional proof, more witnesses now that Sidneys was  under 
Federal  indictment and out of work.  MacMillan was  in  trouble, 
but  it  was clear to Scott, that if the heat got turned  up  too 
much, there was a cache of millions offshore for the person  with 
the right access codes.

His phone rang.

"Scott Mason."

"Hey, Scott this is Kirk.  We gotta talk, I'm in trouble."   Kirk 
sounded panicked.

"Damn Klingons," Scott cracked. 

"Seriously, I'm in trouble.  You gotta help me out."  

Scott realized this was no prank.  "Sure, sure, calm down.   What 
happened?"

"They  found  me,  and they got into my  computer  and  now  it's 
gone . . .shit, I'm in trouble.  You gotta help me."

"Kirk!"  Scott shouted.  "Kirk, relax, ground  yourself.   You're 
not making sense.  Take it from the beginning."

Kirk exhaled heavily in Scott's ear, taking several deep breaths.  
"O.K., I'm O.K., but should we be talking on the phone?"

"Hey, you called me . . .,"  Scott said with irritation.

"Yeah, I know, but I'm not thinking so good.  You're right,  I'll 
call you tonight." 

Click.

* * * * *

Nightline  was  running  its closing credits  when  Scott's  home 
computer  beeped  at him.  Though Kirk had not told him  when  to 
expect  a call, all other communications had begun  precisely  at 
midnight, so Scott made  a reasonable deduction. 

The  dormant  video  screen came to life as   the  first  message 
appeared.

MASON

That was unlike Kirk to start a conversation that way.

wtfo

ITS ME. KIRK.

Now it was Scott's turn to be suspicious.

Prove it.

AW CMON

Prove it.

I CALLED YOU TODAY 

So did half of the crack pots in New York

I'M IN TROUBLE 

So were the others. 

OK.  WE WENT THROUGH THE BANK AND HAD SOME FUN WITH  PRESSED  RAT 
AND WHARTHOG, INC.

Good  enough.  You sound as scared here as you did on the  phone.  
I thought computers didn't have emotion.

I DO.

OK, what's up.

THEY FOUND ME

Who?

THE PEOPLE FROM FIRST STATE BANK.

How? What?

I RECEIVED A MESSAGE ON MY COMPUTER, E-MAIL.  IT SAID, STAY  AWAY 
FROM FIRST STATE BANK.  YOUR HACKING CAREER IS OVER. OR ELSE.

What did you do?

CALLED A FEW FRIENDS WHO THINK THEY'RE FUNNY.

And?

HONOR  AMONG THIEVES.  IT WASN'T THEM.  SO I FIGURED IT  WAS  FOR 
REAL.

You sure?

AS  SURE AS I CAN BE.  MY ACTIVITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO  BE  SECRET.  
NO ONE KNOWS.  EXCEPT YOU.

And you think I did something.

THE THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND MORE THAN ONCE, I'LL TELL YOU. BUT, I 
THINK I HAVE ELIMINATED YOU 

Thanks, Why?

NO MOTIVATION.  I'M MORE USE TO YOU ALIVE THAN DEAD.

Excuse me?

AS LONG AS MY IDENTITY AND ACTIVITIES REMAIN SECRET, I'M ALIVE AS 
A HACKER AND CAN CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I DO.  AS SOON AS I'M  FOUND 
OUT, IT'S OVER.  BUT THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

What is?

I  CAME  HOME THIS MORNING AND FOUND THAT SOMEONE  BROKE  IN  AND 
TRASHED  EVERYTHING.   COMPUTERS, PRINTERS, MONITORS,  THE  WHOLE 
BALL OF WAX.  AND THERE WAS A NOTE.

What did it say?

WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE.  STAY OUT OF OUR COMPUTERS OR YOU  WILL 
BE SORRY.  IT WAS SIGNED FIRST STATE BANK.

That doesn't make sense.

WHAT DOESN'T

Nobody except terrorists leave their calling card, and then  only 
when  they're sure they can't be caught.  I would bet dollars  to 
donuts that First State had nothing to do with it.

ARE YOU SURE?

No,  I'm  not  sure, not 100%, but it  doesn't  add  up.   You've 
stepped  on somebody's toes, and it may or may not have  anything 
to do with First State.  They're just trying to scare you.

AND DOING A DAMNED GOOD JOB OF IT

Have you called the police.

NO.  NOT YET.  I'M NOT IN THE LINE OF WORK THEY PROBABLY  APPROVE 
OF.

So I see.  Who else knew about your trips through the bank, other 
than me. I will assume I'm not the guilty party.

A COUPLE OF HACKER FRIENDS, MY GIRLFRIEND, THAT'S ABOUT IT.

No one else?

NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.

Let me ask you.  If you wanted to find out who was hacking where, 
how  would you find out?  Let's say you wanted to know what  your 
friends were doing.  Is there a way?

NOT WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT.  NO.  YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
TELL SOMEONE.

And you told no one? No one?

WELL, THERE WAS FREEDOM.

What's Freedom?

FREEDOM IS A NATIONAL BBS SYSTEM.  IT'S FAIRLY NEW.  

What do they do?

LIKE MOST BBS'S, IT'S AN OPEN FORUM FOR EXCHANGE OF  INFORMATION, 
PROGRAMS,  ETC.  IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE  COUNTRY.   THEY 
HAVE  BBS AFFILIATES IN 50 OR 60 CITIES.  THEY ALSO RUN A  SHARE-
WARE SERVICE.

Is that significant?

MOST  SHAREWARE COMPANIES SELL THEIR SOFTWARE ON  OTHER  PEOPLE'S 
BBS'S.  THE CONCEPT IS SIMPLE.  THEY GIVE AWAY THEIR SOFTWARE FOR 
FREE.  IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SEND IN A FEW  DOLLARS 
AS A REGISTRATION, AND THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE MONEY.  IT'S PART  OF 
THE  CULTURE,  DON'T BECOME RICH ON SOFTWARE.  FREEDOM  WRITES  A 
TREMENDOUS  AMOUNT  OF SOFTWARE AND THEY PUT IT ON THEIR  OWN  AS 
WELL AS OTHER BBS'S.  IT'S REAL SMART.  THEY BASICALLY HAVE THEIR 
OWN METHOD TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR SOFTWARE.

Do they make money?

WHO  KNOWS.  IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG OPERATION.  VERY  FEW  SHAREWARE 
PEOPLE MAKE MONEY, AND FREEDOM SAYS ITS NON-PROFIT.

Non-Profit did you say? Are you sure?

THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

What's their number?

I ONLY HAVE THE LA NUMBER.

So you are from the Coast.

SHIT.  YEAH.  I'M FROM THE COAST.  

That was an accident.  I really don't care.

I  KNOW.  IT MAY NOT MATTER.  I MAY GIVE IT UP. I DON'T  NEED  MY 
COMPUTERS  BEING BLOWN TO SMITHERINES TO TELL ME I'M  BARKING  UP 
THE WRONG TREE.

Maybe it is the right tree.

WHAT?

Never mind. So, you said you told them?

WELL,  KIND  OF.  YOU SEE, THEY ARE VERY  MUCH  AGAINST  HACKING.  
THEY  ALWAYS  TALK  ABOUT PROSECUTING HACKERS, HOW  BAD  WE  ARE.  
AFTER THE FIRST STATE ARTICLES YOU WROTE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON  THE 
CHAT LINE CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE THE JOB.  NOT THAT WE REALLY   DID 
ANYTHING.   WE  JUST LOOKED AROUND.  ALL THESE GUYS  ADMITTED  TO 
HAVE  DONE  IT,  SO I ADDED MY TWO CENTS AND SAID I  DID  IT.   I 
THOUGHT IT MIGHT ADD TO THE CONFUSION.

Apparently it did.  

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

Let's say I had something to hide, and let's even say I was First 
State.  

SO

So, a bunch of people claim to have wrecked havoc on a  computer.  
What easier way to cover all the possible bases than to  threaten 
them all.  

YOU MEAN EVERYONE WHO ADMITTED IT? OR CLAIMED IT?

Right.  Get to them all.

BUT HOW WOULD FIRST STATE KNOW ABOUT IT?

I'm  not  saying  they did.  Do you know any of  the  others  who 
claimed responsibility?

NOT PERSONALLY.  ONLY ONE GUY NAMED DA VINCI I'VE TALKED TO.

Can you call him?

SURE, HE'S ON FREEDOM ALL THE TIME.

Don't  use  Freedom. Is there any other way to contact  him?   On 
another BBS?

IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO FIND OUT, BUT WHY NOT FREEDOM?

Look.  This BBS may be the only link between the First State hack 
you and I were in on,  by the way, did you use my name?

DIDN'T NEED TO. YOU WROTE THE ARTICLE.  YOU'RE GETTING VERY  WELL 
KNOWN.

Thanks  for the warning. HA! At any rate, you check it  out  with 
this  Da Vinci character and once you know, just call me  at  the 
office,  and  say something like, the Mona  Lisa  frowned.   That 
means  he  got  a message similar to yours.   If  the  Mona  Lisa 
smiles, then we can figure out something else. OK?

SURE.  HEY, QUESTION.

Answer.

SERIOUSLY.  

I'm serious.

WHAT  DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON?  YOU BELIEVE IT'S  HACKERS,  DON'T 
YOU? 

bLet me ask you a question.  How many surrealistic painters  does 
it take to screw in a lightbulb?

I GIVE. HOW MANY

A fish.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND

That's the point. Neither do I. Yet.  But you can help.   Accord-
ing  to  what  you're saying, there may be  some  weirdness  with 
Freedom.   What  do you recommend so I can dig a  little  deeper?  
Into  the whole cult of hacking.  And don't worry.  I don't  hang 
sources.  Besides, I think we may need each other.

HOW DO YOU MEAN?

I think you should talk to the authorities. 

NO WAY 

Wait.   I have a friend, ex-friend, who knows about this kind  of 
thing, at least a little, and he might be of some help to you.  I 
just don't think it should go unreported.  Would you talk to him?

LIVE OR MEMOREX?

He probably would want a face to face, but I can't say for sure.

FORGET IT.  BUT I CAN HELP YOU WITH MORE SOURCES.  AT LEAST I CAN 
TELL YOU WHERE TO GO.

So can a lot of people.

REALLY.  NEXT WEEK, THERE'S A CONVENTION OF SORTS FOR HACKERS.

A convention?

WELL, IT'S MORE LIKE AN UNDERGROUND MEETING, A LARGE ONE.   WHERE 
HACKERS  FROM  ALL OVER GET TOGETHER AND COMPARE NOTES.   IT'S  A 
GREAT  DEAL  OF  FUN, AND FOR YOU, MIGHT BE A  SOURCE  OF  LEADS.  
GENERALLY  SPEAKING  OF COURSE.  YOU CAN'T BE A BULL IN  A  CHINA 
SHOP.

In other words, reporters are taboo.

KIND  OF.  YOU'LL NEED AN INVITATION, I CAN PROBABLY SWING  THAT. 
BEYOND THAT, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.  IT'S A VERY PRIVATE CLUB.

Where is this meeting?

IN AMSTERDAM.

Holland?

YUP.  

Why there?

SIN  CITY IS AS GOOD FOR HACKERS AS IT IS FOR DRUGS AND SEX.   SO 
I'M TOLD.  HA HA.  THE POLICE DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU DO.

What goes on?

BESIDES  THE USUAL AMSTERDAM ANTICS?  A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OF  THE 
BEST  HACKERS  IN THE WORLD SHOW UP TO OSTENSIBLY  SET  CODES  OF 
ETHICS  FOR  THEMSELVES,  JUST LIKE FREEDOM  DOES.   IN  REALITY, 
THOUGH,  WE  STROKE OUR EGOS AND PARADE AROUND  WITH  OUR  LATEST 
CLAIMS  TO FAME AND INVASIONS OF COMPUTERS.  WAR STORIES  OF  THE 
PREVIOUS  YEAR.  NEW CRACKING AND HACKING TECHNIQUES ARE  SHARED, 
PEOPLE LIE TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS AND TALK  ABOUT 
WHAT THEY WILL ACCOMPLISH IN THE NEXT YEAR.  PROGRAMASTERBATION.

Some name.  Is that really what they call it?

NAH, JUST A TERM WE USE.  I WENT LAST YEAR AND HAD A BALL, LITER-
ALLY.   IN  FACT, THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED HOW TO  GET  INTO  FIRST 
STATE.  IT WAS SECOND RATE INFORMATION, FIRST STATE IS NOT EXACT-
LY YOUR HIGH PROFILE BANK TO CRACK.

Understood.  How do I get in, what's it called?  

IT'S  CALLED  THE INTERGALACTIC HACKERS  CONFERENCE,  I-HACK  FOR 
SHORT.  ONLY THE BEST GET TO GO.

You're kidding.  So what do you do to get me in?

I CALL YOU AGAIN.  LEAVE YOUR BOX ON.  I'LL GET YOU AN INVITE.

That's great, I really appreciate that.  Will you be there?

NOT THIS YEAR.  CAN'T SPARE THE TIME.  DON'T ACT LIKE A REPORTER.  
PARANOIA RUNS RAMPANT.

Will anyone talk to me, as a reporter?

THAT'S UP TO YOU.  ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND SHOW SYMPATHY  FOR 
THEIR  ACTIVITIES.  IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL MEET THE RIGHT  PERSON 
WHO CAN GIVE YOU A HANDS ON CRACKING LESSON.  FAIR ENOUGH?

Again,  thanks.  I'll expect your call.  And, I'll let  you  know 
what my Fed-Friend says about your problem.

TA.

     Tuesday,  December 8
     Vienna, Austria

Vienna is not only the geographic center of Europe - for 45 years 
it has been the geopolitical center as well.   A neutral country, 
as  is Switzerland, it contains the highest concentration of  KGB 
and  CIA  operatives in the world.  Perhaps that  is  why  Martin 
Templer chose to meet Alex Spiradon there a week after his  meet-
ing with Tyrone Duncan at P Street.

Situated by the Danube of Strauss fame, Vienna, Austria is an odd 
mixture  of the old, the very old and nouveau European high tech.  
Downtown  Vienna is small, a semi-circle  of cobblestone  streets 
and brash illuminated billboards at every juncture.  

Templer  contacted Alex through intermediaries stationed  in  Zu-
rich.   The  agreed upon location was the third  bench  from  St. 
Stephen's  Cathedral  on the Stephansplatz, where  Vienna's  main 
street,   Karntnerstrasse-Rotenturmstrasse  changes  names.    No 
traffic is allowed on the square, on Kartnerstrasse or on Graben-
strasse,  so  it  is always packed with  shoppers,  tourists  and 
street musicians.  Ideal for a discreet meeting.

"Have  you ever seen Vienna from Old Steffel?" A deep voice  came 
from  behind where Martin was seated.   He looked around and  saw 
it was Alex.

"Many  years  ago.  But I prefer the Prater."   He spoke  of  the 
fairgrounds  2  kilometers  from town where  the  world's  oldest 
Ferris  Wheel offered an unparalleled view of the  Viennese  sur-
rounds.   Templer smiled at his old ally from the  German  Bunde-
poste.  Today though, Alex was an asset to the Agency, as he  had 
been  since he had gone freelance some years ago.   An  expensive 
asset, but always with quality information.  

"Did  you know that St. Stephen's,"  Alex gestured at the  pollu-
tion  stained  church, "is one of the finest examples  of  Gothic 
architecture in Europe?  And Vienna's paradox?"

Templer had never been a history buff.  He shook his head.

"Most  of Vienna is Baroque, in fine fashion, but there are  iso-
lated examples of Gothic.  Yet, they seem to coexist.  In peace."  
Alex's  poetic words rolled off of his well educated tongue.  The 
allegory  was not lost on Templer.  Western and Eastern  intelli-
gence services used Vienna as a no-man's land, where  information 
and people were regularly exchanged.

"It is a new world," commented Templer.  "The threats are differ-
ent."

Alex took the hint.  "Let us walk," he urged.  

They slowly strolled up the Kartnerstrasse as the Austrian night-
life took on its own distinct flavor. 

"How  long  has it been, my friend?"  Alex  casually  asked.   He 
disliked rushing into business, the way the Americans favored. 

"Damned  if  I know.  4, 5, 6 years?  Too long.  We've  had  some 
good times."  

"'85, '86 was it?  So much travel blurs the senses."  Alex  wrin-
kled  his  forehead in thought.  "Wasn't it  the  Pelton  affair?  
Yes,  that would be summer of '85."  He referred to  Ron  Pelton, 
the  ex-NSA  analyst who sold American cryptographic  secrets  to 
the Soviets. 

"Yeah,"   Templer laughed.  "That poor jerk.  I'd  forgotten  all 
about that.  Never would have caught on to the scam if it weren't 
for  Slovnov.  The KGB should tell their own to stay out  of  the 
Moulin Rouge.  Not good for business.  Ivan had to trade  Slovnov 
for  Pelton.   We  didn't find out for a year  that  they  wanted 
Pelton out anyway.  He was too fucked up for them."   

"And  now?   Who do you spy on since Sam and  Ivan  are  brothers 
again?"  Alex openly enjoyed speaking obliquely. 

"Spy?  Ha!"   Templer shook his head.  "I  got  pushed  upstairs.  
Interagency  cooperation,  political  bullshit.  I  do  miss  the 
streets though, and the friends  . . .on both sides."

"Don't  you  mean on all sides?"  Cocktail  semantics  made  Alex 
occasionally annoying.

"No,  I mean both.  At least we had class; we knew the rules  and 
how  to play.  Now every third rate country tries to stick  their 
nose in and they screw it up.  One big mess."  Templer had been a 
staunch  anti-Communist  when there were Communists, but  he  re-
spected  their  agents' highly professional  attitude,  and  yes, 
ethics.

"Touch‚! I have missed our talks and our disagreements.  I  never 
could  talk you into something you did not believe in, could  I?"  
Alex slapped Templer lightly on his back.  Templer didn't answer.  
"Ah, you look so serious.  You came  for business, not old  memo-
ries?"

"No, Alex, I'd love to chat, and we will, but I do need to get  a 
couple  of questions answered, and then, I can relax.  Perhaps  a 
trip  to  Club 24?"  Templer pointed at the bright  yellow  kiosk 
with the silhouettes of naked women emblazoned on it.  For a mere 
$300, you can buy a bottle of Chevas Regal and share it with  one 
or  two  or more of the lovely skimpily clad ladies  who  adorned 
the bar seats.  All else was negotiable in private.

"Done.   Let  us speak, now.  What can I do for you?"   Alex  ap-
proved of the plan.

"I need some information," Templer said seriously.

"That is my business, of course."

"We have a problem in the States . . ."

"As usual," Alex interrupted.

"Yes,"  Templer grinned, "as usual.  But this one is  not  usual.  
Someone, someone with connections, is apparently using  computers 
as a blackmail tool.  The FBI is investigating domestically, and, 
well,  it's our job, to look outside.  So, I figure,  call  Alex.  
That's why I'm here."

Alex  disguised  his surprise.  How had they found him?   He  now 
needed to find out what, if anything, they knew.

"Blackmail?  Computers?  That's not a lot to go on."  Alex  main-
tained absolute composure.

"Here's what we know.  And it's not much.  There appears to be  a 
wholesale blackmail operation in place.  With the number of  com-
plaints  we have gotten over the last few months, we could  guess 
that  maybe 10, or 20 people, maybe more are  involved.   They're 
after  the  big boys; the banks, some senators, folks  with  real 
money  and power.  And it's one professional job.  They  seem  to 
get  their  information from computers, from the  radiation  they 
emanate.  It's something we really want to keep quiet."

Alex  listened  quietly.   If Templer was  being  straight,  they 
didn't  know much, certainly not the scope of the  operation  nor 
Alex's  own involvement.  It was possible, though,  that  Templer 
was  playing dumb, and trying to elicit clues from Alex.   If  he 
was a suspect. 

"What  sort of demands are being made?"  Alex was going  to  play 
the game to the hilt.

"None. Yet."

"After 2 months?  You say?  And no demands?  What kind of  black-
mail   is  that?"   Alex ineffectively stifled  a  laugh.   "This 
sounds  like  some Washington paranoia.  "You really  don't  know 
what to do without an adversary, so you create one," Alex  chuck-
led.

"Alex,  c'mon.   No shit, we got some muckity  mucks  with  their 
heads  in  a tail spin and our asses in a sling.   I  don't  know 
what's  happening,  but, whatever it is, it's causing a  pile  of 
shit bigger than Congress and smellier."

"And  you  thought I might know something about it?"   Alex  ven-
tured.

"Well,  no, or yes, or maybe," Templer said coyly.  "Who's got  a 
grudge?   Against so many people?  And then, who's also  got  the 
technology  to  do it.  There must be a lot of smart  people  and 
money in on it.  You have the best ears in Europe."  The  compli-
ment might help.

"Thank you for the over-statement, but I have only a small  group 
on  whom  I  can rely.  Certainly your own agency  can  find  out 
before I can."  Deniability and humility could raise the ante.

"We have our good days, but too many bad days." Templer was being 
sincere concluded Alex. "Listen,  I need the streets.  If there's 
nothing,  then  there's nothing.  It could be  domestic,  but  it 
smells of outside influence.  Can you help?"

Alex  stopped  to  light up a non-filtr  Gaulloise.   He  inhaled 
deeply  as  his eyes scanned the clear sky.  He  wanted  to  have 
Templer think there might be something.

"How  much  is this information worth?"   Alex  was  the  perfect 
mercenary, absolutely no allegiance to anyone other than himself.  

"We have about fifty grand for good info.  But for that price, it 
had better be good."

Alex had to laugh to himself at the American's naivete.  Homosoto 
was  paying him a hundred times that for one job.  Being a  free-
lancer  means treating all customers as equals, and there was  no 
way he would jeopardize his planned retirement for a cause or for 
a friend.  This would be easy.

"Phew!"  Alex whistled.  "Hot off the griddle, huh? I'll see  who 
knows what.  It may take a while, a week, ten days, but I'll  get 
back to you with anything I find.  No promises, though."

"I  know it's a long shot, but we have to look at all angles.   I 
really  appreciate it."  Templer sounded relieved.  He  had  just 
recruited,  for no money down, the best source of information  in 
Europe.  "Let's go have a bottle of Chevas.  On me."  The  Ameri-
can  taxpayer was about to pay for the sexual relief of a  merce-
nary enemy.

Alex made it home at 4:00 A.M. after the romp in Club 24. Or  was 
it  Club  1?  He no longer knew, no cared.  Despite  his  intense 
intoxication, he had to talk to his employer.  Somehow he managed 
to  get his computer alive.  He dialed the number in  Tokyo,  not 
knowing whether Homosoto would be in the office. 

     ENTER PASSWORD
     ENTER CRYPT KEY

He  responded  to both, nearly blinded from the Chevas,  yet  his 
professionalism demanded that he make immediate contact if possi-
ble.  

     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>

Alex  missed the message for several seconds before forcing  him-
self  alert.   He quickly entered his opening  words  before  the 
connection would shut down.

I have been contacted.

Homosoto  apparently  never went home. He got  an  immediate  re-
sponse.

BY WHOM

The CIA

The  screen  paused for several seconds.  Alex was too  drunk  to 
notice.

HOW?

An old frrrriend. He called for a meeeeeeting.

WHAT DID HE WANT?

He asked about the US operations.

HOW MUCH DOES HE KNOW?

They kkknnow about the blackmail.   But,  they're 
fishing

FISH

Looking for answers.  They know nothing.

TELL ME MORE.  I AM NOT HAPPY.

The  FBI is looking for an answer, who is behind the  propaganda. 
They think it is very important, take it seriously.  They brought 
in the CIA and, probably, the NSA.  The effect is beginning.   We 
should be pleased.

AND THE PRESS?  IS IT IN THE PAPERS?

No, it was suppressed.  The Government still controls the press.

AND YOU.  WHY CONTACT YOU?

The same reason you did.  It  is pure coincidence.

I AM NOT CONVINCED.

An  old friend, a colleague, called for a meeting.  He asked  for 
my help.  He tried to hire me to find out if it was foreign. 

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I told him the streets, the rumors, know nothing.  That is  true. 
He never suspected me.  I was surprised.  He offered me money  to 
give him information.

HOW MUCH MONEY?

$50,000 US

I PAY YOU A THOUSAND TIMES THAT

No, only 100 times.

DOES IT MATTER?

Only if they equal your money.

MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT.  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE.

The  CIA does not have that kind of money.  That is why the  Rus-
sians learned so much for so little.  The US does not think  they 
should pay to keep their secrets.

THEY ARE WRONG.  WE CALL IT INSURANCE.

They call it blackmail.  They do not have the funds.

WHAT WILL YOU TELL THEM?

I  will tell them that it is not from here.  No, it must be  from 
the  US.   They  will believe me.  I will charge  them  for  that 
information.

AND THEY WILL BELIEVE YOU?

If I make them pay, yes.  If I give it for free, no.  That's  the 
American  way.   They will believe what is  easiest  to  believe.  
They do not know that this is my last job.  They cannot know.  If 
they think  that, they will suspect me.  And then, you.

WHY ME?

They will use drugs I cannot resist.  So, I must make sure I help 
them.

AND IF THEY OFFER MONEY.  AS MUCH AS I DO?

Then we negotiate.

THEN YOU WILL DIE.

     Wednesday, December 9
     New York

The  late afternoon pace of the City Room at the Times tended  to 
be  chaotic.  As deadlines approached and the paper was laid  out 
for  the printers, the flurry of activity was associated with  an 
increase in the loudness of the room.   Scott Mason listened with 
one  hand over his right ear and the phone so  awkwardly  pressed 
between  his left ear and shoulder that his glasses sat askew  on 
his  face. Suddenly hanging up the phone, Scott sprung up  shout-
ing,  "I  got  it."   Several people stopped and  stared  in  his 
direction,  but  seeing nothing of concern or interest  to  them, 
they returned to their own world.

Scott  ripped a page from a notebook and ran into and around  his 
co-workers.  "Doug, I got it. Confirmed by the President."

"You're  kidding  me?" Doug stopped his  red  pencil  mid-stroke. 
"Give  it to me from the top."  He turned in his swivel chair  to 
face Scott more directly.

"It  goes like this.  A few weeks ago Sovereign Bank  in  Atlanta 
found  that someone had entered their central  computers  without 
permission."  Scott perused his notes.  "It didn't take long  for 
them to find the intruder.  He left a calling card.  It said that 
the  hackers  had found a hole to crawl through  undetected  into 
their  computers.  Was the bank interested in knowing how it  was 
done?  They left a Compuserve Mail Box.  

"As you can imagine the bank freaked out and told their  computer 
people  to fix whatever it was.  They called in the  FBI,  that's 
from my contact, and went on an internal rampage.  Those good ol' 
boys don't trust nobody," Scott added sounding like a poor imita-
tion of Andy from Mayberry.  

"Anybody  that could spell computer was suspect and  they  turned 
the place upside down.  Found grass, cocaine, ludes, a couple  of 
weapons  and  a lot of people got fired.  But no  state  secrets.  
You  talk  about a dictatorship," commented Scott  on  the  side.  
"There's  no privacy at all.  They scanned everyone's  electronic 
mail  boxes looking for clues and instead found them  staring  at 
invasion  of  privacy suits from employees and  ex-employees  who 
were fired because of the contents of their private mail.

"The  computer jocks unplugged the computers, turned them  inside 
out  and  screwed them back together.  Nothing. They found  nada.  
So  they tighten the reins and give away less passwords, to  less 
people.  That's all they figured they could do."

"This is where the fun starts."  Scott actively gestured with his 
hands as he shifted weight to his other foot.  "A few days  later 
they discover another message in their computer.  Says  something 
like,  'sorry Charlie' or something to that effect.  The  hackers 
were  back.  And this time they wanted to sell their services  to 
the  bank.  For a nominal fee, say, a million bucks,  we'll  show 
you how to sew up the holes."

"Well, what does that sound like to you?" Scott asked Doug.

"Extortion."

"Exactly,  and ape-shit doesn't begin to describe what  the  bank 
did.  Bottom  line?  They made a deal.  We'll pay you  a  million 
bucks as consultants for 10 years.  You agree to stay out of  the 
machines  unless  we  need you.  Immunity unless  you  break  the 
deal."

"What happened?" Doug said with rapt attention.

"Sovereign bank now has three fourteen year old consultants at  a 
hundred  grand a year," Scott said choking with laughter  on  his 
words.

"You're kidding," exclaimed Doug slapping his knees.

"No shit.  And everyone is pretty happy about it.  The kids  have 
a way to pay for a good college, they're bright little snots, and 
they get off.  The bank figures it's making an investment in  the 
future  and actually may have gotten off cheap.  It woke them  up 
to  the problems they could face if their computers did  go  down 
for  a month.  Or if they lost all their records.  Or if  someone 
really  wanted to do damage.  Thoughts like that trigger a  panic 
attack in any bank exec.  They'd rather deal with the kids.

"In  fact, they're turning it into a public relations coup.   Dig 
this," Scott knew the story like the back of his hand.  "The bank 
realized that they could fix their security problems for a couple 
of million bucks.  Not much of an investment when you're guarding 
billions.   So  they design a new ad  campaign:  Sovereign.   The 
Safest Your Money Can Be."

"Now  that's  a story," said Doug approvingly.  "Important,  fun, 
human,  and everyone comes out a winner.  A story with  a  moral.  
Confirmed?"

"Every  bit.  From the president.  They announce it all  tomorrow 
and we print tonight with their blessing. Exclusive."

"Why?  What did you have to do . . ?"

"Nothing.   He  likes the work we've been doing on  the  computer 
capers  and crime and all and thought that we would give it  fair 
coverage.  I think they're handling it like absolute gentlemen."

"How fast do you type?"

"Forty mistakes a minute.  Why?"

"You got 40 minutes to deadline."

     Friday, December 11
     Washington, D.C.

Throughout his years of Government service at the National  Secu-
rity Agency, Miles Foster had become a nine to fiver.  Rarely did 
he  work in the evening or on weekends. So the oddball  hours  he 
had to work during his association with Homosoto were  irritating 
and  made him cranky. He could function well enough, and  cranki-
ness was difficult to convey over a computer terminal, but  work-
ing  nights  wasn't much to his liking.  It interfered  with  his 
social responsibilities to the women.

The master plan Miles had designed years ago for Homosoto was now 
calling  for phase two to go into effect.  The beauty of it  all, 
thought Miles, was that it was unstoppable.  The pieces had  been 
put  into play by scores of people who workedfor him;  the  pro-
grammers,  the Freedom League BBS's and the infectors.  Too  much 
had  already gone into play to abort the mission.  There  was  no 
pulling back.

Only a few weeks were left before the first strike force  landed.  
The  militaristic  thinking kept Miles focussed on  the  task  at 
hand, far away from any of the personalization that might surface 
if he got down to thinking about the kinds of damage he was going 
to be inflicting on millions of innocent targets. Inside, perhaps 
deep  inside, Miles cared, but he seemed to only be aware of  the 
technical  results  of his efforts in distinction  to  the  human 
element.   The human elements of frustration,  depression,  help-
lessness - a social retreat of maybe fifty years, that was  going 
to be the real devastation above and beyond the machinery.   Just 
the way Homosoto wanted it.  To hurt deep down.  

Miles had come to learn of the intense hatred that Homosoto  felt 
toward the United States.  In his more callous moments, especial-
ly when he and Homosoto were at odds over any particular subject, 
Miles would resort to the basest of verbal tactics.

"You're  just  pissed off 'cause we nuked your family."   It  was 
meant  to  sting  and Homosoto's  reactions  were  unpredictable.  
Often violent, he had once thrown priceless heirlooms across  his 
office  shattering  in a thousand shards. A  three  hour  lecture 
ensued  on one occasion, tutoring Miles about honorable  warfare.  
Miles listened and fell asleep during more than one sermon.  

But at the bottom of it, Homosoto kept a level head and showed he 
knew  what he was doing.  The plans they formulated  were  coming 
together though Miles had no direct control over many pieces. The 
Readers  were  run by another group altogether; Miles  only  knew 
they were fundamentalist fanatics.  He didn't really care as long 
as  the  job was getting done.  And the groundhogs;  he  designed 
them, but they were managed by others.  Propaganda, yet  another, 
just as the plan called for.  Extreme compartmentalization,  even 
at the highest level.

Only  Homosoto knew all the players and therefore had the  unique 
luxury  of  viewing the grand game being  played.   Though  Miles 
designed  every nuance, down to the nth degree of how  to  effect 
the invasion properly, he was not privileged to push the chessmen 
around the board.  His rationalization was that he was being paid 
a great deal of money for the job, and he was working for a  more 
important  cause, one that would make it all worthwhile.  Perhaps 
in  another year or two when the final phases were complete,  and 
the  United States was even more exposed and defenseless than  it 
was right now, the job would be done. 

Miles' ruminating provided a calming influence during the  inter-
minable months and years that distanced the cause and effect.  In 
the  intelligence game, on the level that he had  operated  while 
with  the  NSA, he would receive information,  process  it,  make 
recommendation  and  determinations, and that  was  that.   Over.  
Next.  

Now  though, Miles had designed the big picture, and  that  meant 
long  range planning.  No more instant gratification.  He was  in 
control, only partially, as he was meant to be.  He was impressed 
with  the operation. That nothing had gone awry so  far  consoled 
Miles despite the fact that Homosoto called him almost every  day 
to ask about another computer crime he had heard about.

This time is was Sovereign Bank.  Homosoto had heard rumors  that 
they  were being held hostage by hackers and was  concerned  that 
some of Miles' techies had gone out on their own.

Homosoto  reacted  to the Sovereign issue as he had  many  others 
that he seemed so concerned about.  Once Miles gave him an expla-
nation, he let the matter drop.  Not without an appropriate warn-
ing to Miles, though,  that he had better be right.

The  number of computer crimes was increasing more  rapidly  than 
Miles  or anyone in the security field had predicted only  a  few 
years  ago  and the legal issues were mounting  faster  than  the 
state  or  federal legislatures could deal with  them.   But,  as 
Miles continually reassured Homosoto, they were small timers with 
no heinous motivation.  They were mostly kids who played  chicken 
with  computers instead of chasing cars or smoking crack.  A  far 
better alternative, Miles offered.  

Just  kids having a little fun with the country's most  important 
computer systems.  No big deal.  Right?  How anyone can leave the 
front door to their computer open, or with the keys lying around, 
was beyond him. Fucking stupid.

His  stream of consciousness was broken when his NipCom  computer 
announced that Homosoto was calling. Again. Shit. I bet some high 
school  kids changed their school grades and Homosoto thinks  the 
Rosenburgs are behind it.  Paranoid gook.

Never Mind.  What do you need?

WE ARE CLOSE

I know.

OF COURSE YOU DO.  A BRIEF REPORT PLEASE.

Sure.  Freedom is doing better than expected. Over a million now, 
maybe  a  million and a half.  The majors are  sick,  real  sick.  
Alex  has  kept my staff full, and we're putting out   dozens  of

GOOD

I'm gonna be out for a few days. I'll call when  I 
get back.

SHOULDN'T YOU STAY WHERE YOU CAN BE REACHED?

I  carry a portable.  I will check my computer, as I  always  do. 
You have never had trouble reaching me.

THAT IS TRUE. WHERE DO YOU GO?

HOLLAND? WHY?

A  hackers  conference.  I need a break anyway, so  I  thought  I

     San Francisco, California

Sir George Sterling checked his E-Mail for messages.  There  were 
only  2, both from Alex.  The one week holiday had been good  for 
Sir George.  Well earned, he thought.  In less than 3 months,  he 
had called over 1,700 people on the phone and let them in on  his 
little secrets, as he came to call them. 

Every month Alex had forwarded money, regular like clockwork, and 
Sir George had diligently followed instructions.  To the  letter.  
Not  so much in deference to the implicit threats issued  him  by 
Alex,  over computer and untraceable of course, but by the  pros-
pect  of continued income.  He came to enjoy the work.  Since  he 
was in America and his calls were to Americans, he had the oppor-
tunity  to dazzle them with his proper and refined accent  before 
he  let the hammer down with whatever tidbit of private  informa-
tion he was told to share with them. 

In  the beginning Sir George had little idea of what the  motiva-
tion  behind his job was, and still, he wasn't  completely  sure.  
He  realized  each call he made contained the undercurrent  of  a 
threat.   But he never threatened anyone, his  instructions  were 
explicit;  never  threaten.  So therefore, he reasoned,  he  must 
actually be making threats, no matter how veiled.

He  rather enjoyed it all.  Not hurting people, that  wasn't  his 
nature,  but he savored impressing people with his knowledge  and 
noting their reactions for his daily reports back to Alex. In the 
evenings  Sir  George searched out  small  American  recreational 
centers  inaccurately  referred to as pubs.  In  fact  they  were 
disguised  bars with darts and warm beer, but it gave Sir  George 
the chance to mingle and flash his assumed pedigree.  When  asked 
what he did for a living, he truthfully said, "I talk to people."  
About what?  "Whatever interests them."

He  became somewhat of a celebrated fixture at several 'pubs'  in 
Marin County where he found the atmosphere more to his liking;  a 
perfectly civilized provincial suburb of San Francisco where  his 
purchased  affectations  wore well on the  locals  who  endlessly 
commuted  to their high tech jobs in Silicon Valley 40  miles  to 
the south.

Hawaii  had been, as he said, "Quite the experience."   Alex  had 
informed  him  one day that he was to take a holiday  and  return  
ready  for  a  new assignment, one to which now  he  was  ideally 
suited.   Sir  George smiled to himself.  A job  well  done,  and 
additional  rewards.  That was a first for George Toft of  dreary 
Manchester, England.  

Since he did not have a printer, there was no way he would  jeop-
ardize his livelihood for a comfort so small, he read his  E-Mail 
by copying the messages into Word Perfect, and then reading  them 
at his leisure.  All E-Mail was encrypted with the Public Private 
RSA  algorithm, so he had to manually decrypt the  messages  with 
his private key and save them unencrypted.  When he was done,  he 
erased the file completely, to keep anyone else from  discovering 
the nature of his work.  Alex's first message was dated two  days 
before he returned from Hawaii.  It was actually cordial, as  far 
as Alex  could be considered cordial.  After their first  meeting 
in Athens, Alex had taken on a succinct if not terse tone in  all 
communications.

Sir George:

Welcome  back.  I hope you had a most enjoyable holiday.  It  was 
well deserved. 

We now enter phase two of our operations.  We place much faith in 
your ability and loyalty.  Please do not disrupt that confidence.

As in the past, you will be given daily lists  of 
people to call.  They are some of the people whom you have called 
before.   As  before, identify yourself and the  nature  of  your 
call.   I am sure your last call was so disturbing to them,  they 
will take your call this time as well.

 Then, once you have confirmed  their  identity, 
give  them the new information provided, and ask them  to  follow 
the  instructions  given, to the letter.  Please  be  your  usual 
polite self.

Alex

The second message was more Alex-like:

     Sir George:

     If  you have any problems with your new  assignment,  please 
     call me to arrange your termination.

     Alex.

"Hello?  Are you there?" Sir George Sterling spoke with  as  much 
elegance he could muster.  "This is John Fullmaster calling again 
for  Robert Henson."  Sir George remembered the name but not  the 
specifics.

"One moment please," Maggie said.  "Mr. Henson?"  She said  after 
dialing  his intercom extension. "It's John Fullmaster  for  you. 
Line three"

"Who?"

"Mr.  Fullmaster.  He called once several months ago.  Don't  you 
remember?"   He thought.  Fullmaster.  Fullmaster.  Oh,  shit.  I 
thought  he  was a bad dream.  Goddamn  blackmailer.   Never  did 
figure  how  he knew about the Winston Ellis  scam.   Good  thing 
that's been put to bed and over.  

"All  right,  I'll  take  it."  He punched  up  the  third  line.  
"Yeah?"  He said defiantly. 

"Mr.  Henson?   This is John Fullmaster.  I believe  we  spoke  a 
while back about some of your dealings?  Do you recall?"

"Yes, I recall you bastard, but you're too late.  The deal closed 
last month.  So you can forget your threats.  Fuck off and  die."  
Henson used his best boardroom belligerence.

"Oh,  I  am sorry that you thought I was threatening you,  I  can 
assure you I wasn't."  Sir George oozed politeness.

"Bullshit.   I  don't know how the blazes  you  learned  anything 
about my business, and I don't really care . . ."

"I think you might care, sir, if you will allow me to speak for a 
moment."  Sir George interjected.  The sudden interruption caught 
Henson off guard.  He stood his ground in silence.

"Thank  you."   Sir George waited for  an  acknowledgement  which 
never  arrived, so he continued. "Winston Ellis is old news,  Mr. 
Henson, very old news.  I read today, though, that Miller Pharma-
ceuticals is about to have its Anti-AIDS drug turned down by  the 
FDA.   Apparently it still has too many side effects and  may  be 
too  dangerous  for  humans.  I'm sure you've  read  the  reports 
yourself. Don't you think it would be wise to tell your investors 
before  they  sink another $300 Million into a  black  hole  from 
which  there  is  no escape?"  The  aristocratic  British  accent 
softened  the  harshness of the words, but not the auger  of  the 
meaning.

Henson  seethed.  "I don't know who you are," he hissed,  "but  I 
will  not  listen  to  this  kind  of  crap.   I  won't  take  it 
from . . ."

"Sorry,"  Sir George again interrupted, "but I'm afraid you  will 
listen.   The instructions are as follows.  I want $5 Million  in 
small  bills in a silver Samsonite case to be placed into  locker 
number  235 at Grand Central Station, first level.  You  have  48 
hours  to  comply. If you do not have the money  there,  we  will 
release  these  findings to the media and the SEC which  will  no 
doubt  prompt an investigation into this and other of your  deal-
ings.  Don't you think?"

Blackmail was anathema to Robert Henson, although he should  have 
felt  quite  comfortable in its milieu.  It was  effectively  the 
same stunt he performed on many of his investors.  Nobody  treats 
Robert  Henson this way, nobody.  He needed time to  think.   The 
last  time Fullmaster called it was a bluff, obviously, but  then 
there were no demands.  This time, he wanted something.  But, how 
did  he  know?  The FDA reports were still confidential,  and  he 
hoped  to  have completed raising the funds  before  the  reports 
became public, another few weeks at most.  He counted on  ineffi-
cient  government bureaucracy and indifference to delay  any  an-
nouncement.   Meanwhile though, he would pocket several  millions 
in banking fees.

"You got me.  I'll do it.  235. Right?"

"Very good, Mr. Henson.  I'm glad you see it my way.  It has been 
a  pleasure doing business with you."  Sir George sounded like  a 
used  car salesman. "Oh, yes, I almost forgot.  Please, Mr.  Hen-
son, no police.  In that case, our deal is off."

"Of  course,  no  police.  No problem.   Thanks  for  the  call."  
Henson hung up.  Fuck him.  No money, no way.  

* * * * *

"Mr. Faulkner, this is John Fullmaster."  Sir George was  sicken-
ingly sweet.  "Do you recall our last conversation?"

How  couldn't he?  This was the only call he had received on  his 
private line since that maniac had last called.  Faulkner had had 
the  number  changed at least a half a dozen times  since,  as  a 
matter  of  course, but still, Fullmaster, if that was  his  real 
name, reached him with apparent ease.

"Yes, I remember," he said tersely.  "What do you want now?"

"Just a piece of the action, Mr. Faulkner."

"What the hell does that mean?"

"Well,  according  to my records, you have lost quite  a  sum  of 
money since our last conversation, and it would be such a  shame, 
don't you agree, if California National Bank found out they  lost 
another $2 million to your bad habits?"  Sir George instinctively 
thought Faulkner was a California slime ball, never mind his  own 
actions, and he briefly thought that he might actually be   work-
ing for the side of good after all.

"You  have  a real doctor's bedside manner.  What do  you  want?"  
Faulkner conveyed extreme nervousness.

"I  think,  under the circumstances that, shall we say,  oh,  one 
million would do it.  Yes, that sounds fair."

"One  million? One million dollars?" Faulkner shrieked  from  his 
pool side lounge chair.

"Yessir,  that sounds just about right."  Sir George  paused  for 
effect.   "Now here is what I want you to do.  Go to  Las  Vegas, 
and  have your credit extended, and acquire small  bills.   Then, 
place  the  money in a silver Samsonite case  at  Union  Station.  
Locker number 12.  Is that simple enough?"  British humor at  its 
best.

"Simple, yes. Possible, no," Faulkner whispered in terror.

"Oh,  yes, it is possible, as you well know.  You cleared up  the 
$2.4  Million you owed Caesar's only last week.  Your  credit  is 
excellent."

"There's  no  way you can know that . . ."  Then it  occurred  to 
him.   The  mob.   He wasn't losing enough at  the  tables,  they 
wanted  more.   Losing money was one thing, his way, but  a  sore 
winner is the worst possible enemy.  He had no choice.  There was 
only one way out.

"All right, all right.  What locker number?"

"Twelve.   Within 48 hours.  And, I probably needn't mention  it, 
but no police."

"Of  course," Faulkner smiled to himself.  At last the  nightmare 
would be over.

"Thank you so very much.  Have a nice day."

* * * * *

"Merrill!  It's the blackmailer again. Merrill, do you hear  me?"  
Ken Boyers tried to get Senator Rickfield out from the centerfold 
of the newest Playboy.  "Merrill!"

"Oh  sorry,  Ken.  Just reading the articles.  Now what  is  it?"  
Rickfield  put  the magazine down, slowly, for one  last  lustful 
gaze.

"Merrill,  that Fullmaster fellow, the one who called  about  the 
Credite Suisse arrangements . . ."

"Shut  up!   We don't talk about that in this  office,  you  know 
that!"  Rickfield admonished Ken.

"I know, but he doesn't," he said, pointing at the blinking light 
on the Senator's desk phone.

"I thought he went away.  Nothing ever came of it, did it?"  

"No,  nothing,  after we got General Young onto it,"  Boyers  ex-
plained.  "I  thought he took care of it, in his  own  way.   The 
problem just disappeared like it was supposed  to."

"Well," Rickfield said scornfully, "obviously it didn't.  Give me 
the  goddamned phone."  He picked it up and pressed  the  lighted 
button.  His senatorial dignity was absent as he spoke.

"This is Rickfield.  Who is this?"  

"Ah, thank you for taking my call.  Yes, thank you."  Sir  George 
spoke  slowly, more slowly than necessary.  This call was  marked 
critical.   That  meant,  don't screw it up.  "My  name  is  John 
Fullmaster  and  I believe we spoke about some  arrangements  you 
made with General Young and Credite Suisse."

"I  remember.  So what?  That has nothing to do with me,"   Rick-
field  retorted.  He grabbed a pen and wrote down the name,  John 
Fullmaster.  Ken looked at the scribbled writing and shrugged his 
shoulders. 

"Ah,  but  I'm afraid it does.  I see here that  Allied  Dynamics 
recently made a significant contribution to a certain account  in 
Credite  Suisse.  There are only two signators on  the  passbook.  
It also says here that they will be building two new factories in 
your  state.  Quite an accomplishment.  I am sure your  constitu-
ents would be proud."

The  color drained from Rickfield's face.  He put his  hand  over 
the  mouthpiece  to  speak privately to Ken.   "Who  else  knows?  
Don't bullshit me, boy.  Who else have you told?"

"No  one!"  Boyers said in genuine shock.  "I want to  enjoy  the 
money, not pay attorney's fees."

Rickfield  waved  Boyers away.  He appeared  satisfied  with  the 
response.   "This  is  speculation.  You can't  prove  a  thing."  
Rickfield took a shot to gauge his opponent.

"Believe  that if you wish, Senator, but I don't think it  is  in 
either  of  our best interests to play the other for  the  fool."  
Sir  George  saw that Rickfield did not attain  his  position  as 
Chairman  of  the Senate Committee on Space,  Transportation  and 
Technology by caving in to idle demands or threats.  In fact,  in 
34  years of Senate service, Senator Merrill Rickfield  had  sur-
vived  8 presidents, counseling most of them to  varying  degrees 
depending upon the partisan attitude of the White House.

At  65,  much of the private sector would have  forced  him  into 
retirement,  but  elected Government service  permitted  him  the 
tenure  to continue as long as his constituents allowed.   Claude 
Pepper  held  the record and Merrill Rickfield's  ego  wanted  to 
establish new definitions of tenure.

His involvement with General Chester Oliver Young was recent,  in 
political terms; less than a decade.  During the Reagan  military 
buildup,  nearly  3 trillion dollars worth,  defense  contractors 
expanded  with the economy, to unprecedented levels and  profits.  
Congress was convinced that $300 Billion per year was about right 
to  defend  against a Cold War enemy that couldn't feed  its  own 
people.   The overestimates of the CIA, with selective and  often 
speculative  information provided by the  country's  intelligence 
gatherer, the NSA, helped define a decade of political and  tech-
nological achievements:  Star Wars, Stealth, MX, B1, B2 and other 
assorted toys that had no practical use save all out war.  

With that kind of spending occurring freely, and the Senate Over-
sight  Committee in a perpetual state of the doldrums, there  was 
money  to  be made for anyone part of Washington's good  ol'  boy 
network.  General Young was one such an opportunistic militarist.  
Promoted  to one star general in 1978, after two  lackluster  but 
politically  well connected tours in Vietnam, it was deemed  pru-
dent  by  the power brokers of that war to bring Young  into  the 
inner  rings of the Pentagon with the corresponding perks such  a 
position brought.  But Young had bigger and better ideas.  

He  saw countless ways to spend taxpayers money  protecting  them 
from the Communist threat of the Evil Empire, but had  difficulty 
getting support from his two and three star superiors.  It didn't 
take him long to realize that he had been token promoted to  keep 
his  mouth  shut about certain prominent people's  roles  in  the 
Vietnam  era.   Events  that were better left to  a  few  trusted 
memories than to the history books. 

So  Young decided to go out on his own and find support from  the 
legislative  branch;  find  an influential proponent  for  a  few 
specific  defense  programs by which he could profit.   Over  the 
course  of  a  few years, he and Senator  Rickfield  became  fast 
friends, holding many of the same global views and fears, if  not 
paranoias.   When  Allied  Dynamics  began  losing  Congressional 
support  for  an advanced jet helicopter project, Young  went  to 
Rickfield  for  help.   After all, Allied  was  headquartered  in 
Rickfield's  home state, and wouldn't it be a great boon  to  the 
economy?  The recession was coming to an end and that meant jobs.

Rickfield was unaware, initially, that Allied had an  arrangement 
with General Young to donate certain moneys to certain charities, 
in certain Swiss bank accounts if certain spending programs  were 
approved.   Only when Rickfield offered some later resistance  to 
the Allied projects did Young feel the need to share the  wealth.  
After  25  years in Congress, and very little money put  away  to 
show for it, Rickfield was an easy target.

Rickfield's recruitment by Young, on Allied's behalf, had yielded 
the Senator more than enough to retire comfortably on the  island 
paradise  of  his choice.  Yet, Rickfield found  an  uncontrolled 
desire  for more; considerations was his word for it, just as  he 
had  grown used to wielding power and influence in  the  nation's 
capital.   Rickfield was hooked, and Credite Suisse was the  cer-
tain  Swiss bank in question.  Ken Boyers was involved  as  well, 
almost from the start.  They both had a lot to lose.

"No, I must assume that you are not a fool, and I know for a fact 
I  am  not  one, so on that one point we  do  agree."   Political 
pausing  often allowed your opponent to hang himself  with  addi-
tional oration.   Rickfield found the technique useful, especial-
ly on novices.  "Please continue."

"Thank  you." Sir George said with a hint of patronization.   "To 
be  brief, Senator, I want you to keep your money, I  think  that 
dedicated civil servants like yourself are grossly underpaid  and 
underappreciated.   No sir, I do not wish to deny you the  chance 
to  make  your golden years pleasant after such  a  distinguished 
career."

"Then  what is it.  What do you want from me?"  The  Senator  was 
doodling nervously while Ken paced the room trying to figure  out 
what was being said at the other end of the phone. 

"I'm glad you asked," said Sir George.  "Beginning next month you 
are  chairing  a  sub-committee that will  be  investigating  the 
weaknesses and potential threats to government computer  systems.  
As  I  remember it is called the Senate Select  Sub-Committee  on 
Privacy and Technology Containment.  Is that right?"

"Yes, the dates aren't firm yet, and I haven't decided if I  will 
chair the hearings or assign it to another committee member.   So 
what?"

"Well,  we  want you to drag down the  hearings.  Nothing  more."  
Sire George stated his intention as a matter of fact rather  than 
a request.

Rickfield's  face  contorted in confusion. "Drag  down?   Exactly 
what does that mean, to you, that is?"

"We  want you to downplay the importance of security for  govern-
ment  computers.   That there really is no threat  to  them,  and 
that government has already met all of its obligations in balance 
with  the  new world order, if you will.  The  threats  are  mere 
scare  tactics by various special interest groups and  government 
agencies who are striving for long term self preservation."   Sir 
George  had practiced his soliloquy before calling Senator  Rick-
field.

"What  the  hell for?"  Rickfield raised his  voice.   "Security?  
Big deal!  What's it to you?"

"I am not at liberty to discuss our reasons.   Suffice it to say, 
that we would be most pleased if you see to it that the  hearings 
have minimal substance and that no direct action items are deliv-
ered.   I  believe that term you Americans so eloquently  use  is 
stonewall, or perhaps filibuster?"

"They're not the same things."

"Fine, but you do understand nonetheless.  We want these hearings 
to epitomize the rest of American politics with  procrastination, 
obfuscation  and  procedural  gerrymandering."   Sir  George  had 
learned quite a bit about the political system since he had moved 
to the States.

"And  to what aim?"  Rickfield's political sense was  waving  red 
flags. 

"That's it.  Nothing more."

"And  in return?"  The Senator had learned to be direct in   mat-
ters  of additional compensation since he had hooked up with  the 
earthy General.

"I  will  assure you that the details of your  arrangements  with 
Allied Dynamics will remain safe with me."

"Until the next time, right?  This is blackmail?"

"No.  Yes."   Sir George answered.  "Yes, it  is  blackmail,  but 
without the usual messiness.  And no, there will be no next time.  
For, as soon as the hearings are over, it would be most advisable 
for  you to take leave of your position and enjoy the  money  you 
have earned outside of your paycheck."

"And,  if I don't agree to this?"  Rickfield was looking  at  his 
options which seemed to be somewhere between few and none.  Maybe 
he only had one. 

"That  would be so unfortunate." Sir George smiled as  he  spoke.  
"The  media will receive  a two page letter, it is  already  pre-
pared I can assure you, detailing your illegal involvements  with 
Allied, General Young and Mr. Boyers."

"What's in it for you?  You don't want any money?"  The confusion 
in Rickfield's mind was terribly obvious, and he was sliding on a 
logical Mobius loop. 

"No Senator, no money.  Merely a favor."

"I will let you know what I decide.  May I have your number?"

"I do not need to contact you again.  Your answer will be evident 
when  the  hearings begin.  Whatever course you pursue,  we  will 
make an appropriate response."

"Scott!"  A woman called across the noisy floor.  "Is your  phone 
off the hook?"

"Yeah,  why?"  He looked up and couldn't match the voice  with  a 
person.

"You gotta call."

"Who is it? I'm busy."

"Some  guy from Brooklyn sounds like.  Says he got a package  for 
you?"

Holy  shit.  It's Vito!  Scott's anonymous caller.  The  one  who 
had caused him so much work, so much research without being  able 
to print one damn thing.  

Not yet.

"Yeah,  OK.  It's back on."  The phone rang instantly  and  Scott 
rushed to pick it up on the first ring.

"Yeah, Scott Mason here."  He sounded hurried.

"Yo!   Scott.   It's  me, your friend, rememba?"   No  one  could 
forget the accent that sounded more fake than real.  He had  been 
nicknamed Vito for reference purposes by Scott.

"Sure  do, fella," Scott said cheerily.  "That bunch of shit  you 
sent me was worthless.  Garbage."

"Yeah,  well,  we may have fucked up a little  on  that.   Didn't 
count on youse guys having much in the ethics department if youse 
know what I mean."  Vito laughed at what he thought was a  pretty 
good  joke. "So, we all screw up, right?  Now and  again?   Never 
mind  that,  I got something real good,  something  youse  really 
gonna like."

"Sure you do."

"No, really, dig this.  I gotta list of names that . . . "

"Great another list.  Just what I need.  Another list."

"Whad'ar'ya,  a  wise guy?  Youse wanna talk or  listen?"   Scott 
didn't  answer.   "That's better, cause youse  gonna  like  this.  
Some  guy  named  Faulkner, big shit banker from La  La  Land  is 
borrowing  money from the mob to pay off a blackmailer.   Another 
guy, right here in New York Shitty, a Wall Street big shot called 
Henson, him too.  Another one named Dobbs, same thing.  All being 
blackballed by the same guys. Youse want more?"

"I'm writing, quiet.  Faulkner, Henson and Dobbs, right?"

"That's whad'I said, yeah."

"So how come you know so much?"

"That's my job. I deal in information.  Pretty good, huh?"

"Maybe. I gotta check it out.  That last stuff was . . ."

"Hey!"  Vito interrupted, "I told youse 'bout that.  Eh,  paysan, 
what's a slip up among friends, right?"

"I'll ignore that.  Gimme a couple of days, I'll call you."

"Like  hell  you will. I'll call you.  You'll see, this  is  good 
stuff.  No shit.  All right? Two days."

     Monday,  December 14
     Washington, D.C.

The  FBI runs a little known counter intelligence operation  from 
the  middle of a run down Washington, D.C. neighborhood  on  Half 
Street.   Getting  in and out is an exercise in  evasive  not  to 
mention  defensive driving.  The South East quadrant of  Washing-
ton,  D.C. is vying for the drug capital of the nation, and  per-
haps  has  the dubious distinction of having the  highest  murder 
rate  per capita in the United States. Since the CI  division  of 
the  FBI  is a well kept secret, its location  was  strategically 
chosen  to keep the casual passerby from stopping in for a  chat. 
Besides,  there was no identification on the front of the  build-
ing.  

Most  Americans think that the CIA takes care of  foreign  spies, 
but their agents are limited to functioning on foreign land.   On 
the domestic front the FBI Counter Intelligence Group is assigned 
to  locate and monitor alien intelligence activities.  For  exam-
ple,  CI-3 is assigned to focus on Soviet and East  Bloc  activi-
ties, and other groups focus on their specific target  countries. 
Thus,  there  is a certain amount of competition, not all  of  it 
healthy,  between the two agencies chartered to protect  our  na-
tional  interests.  The CIA is under the impression that it  con-
trols all foreign investigations, even if they tread upon  United 
States  territory.   This line of thinking has  been  a  constant 
source  of irritation and inefficiency since the OSS  became  the 
CIA  during  the Truman administration.  Only during  the  Hoover 
reign  at the FBI days was there any sense  of peaceful  coexist-
ence.  Hoover did what he damn well pleased, and if anyone  stood 
in  his  way,  he simply called up the White House  and  had  the 
roadblock removed.  Kennedy era notwithstanding, Hoover held  his 
own for a 50 year reign.

Tyrone  Duncan  received  an additional  lesson  on  inter-agency 
rivalry when he was called down to Half Street.  His orders  were 
similar to those he had received from  the safe house in  George-
town  months before.  Stick to your hackers and viruses,  period, 
he was told. If it smells of foreign influence, let the CI  fight 
it out with Langley.  Keep your butt clean.

In 25 years of service, Tyrone had never been so severely  admon-
ished for investigating a case that he perceived as being  domes-
tic in nature.  The thought of foreign influences at work had not 
occurred to him, until CI brought it up.  

As  far as he was concerned the quick trip from New York to  Half 
Street  was  a bureaucratic waste of time  and  money.   However, 
during the fifteen minute discussion he was told by his CI compa-
triots that both the blackmail and the ECCO investigations situa-
tions had international repercussions and he should keep his nose 
out  of  it.  CI was doing just fine without  Tyrone's  help.The 
meeting, or warning as Tyrone Duncan took it, served to raise  an 
internal flag.  

There  was a bigger picture, something beyond a classical  black-
mail operation and some hackers screwing with government  comput-
ers,  and he was being excluded.  That only meant one thing.   He 
was  pushing  someone's button and he didn't know how,  where  or 
why.   The  Trump Shuttle flight back to La Guardia  gave  Tyrone 
time  to  think  about it, and that only  incensed  him  further. 
Aren't  we all on the same team?  If I stumbled  onto  something, 
and you want me to back off, O.K., but at least let me know  what  
I'm missing.

Twenty  five  years and a return to Hoover paranoia.   He  under-
stood,  and  advocated,  the need for secrecy,  privacy  and  the 
trappings  of  confidentiality.   But,  compartmentalization   of 
information this extreme was beyond the normal course to which he 
was accustomed.  The whole thing stunk.

He  arrived back at New York's Federal Square during lunch  hour. 
Normally there was a minimal staff at that hour, or hour and half 
or  two hours depending upon your rank.  When the elevator  doors 
opened on Level 5, seventy feet under lower Manhattan, he  walked 
into  a  bustle of activity normally present only  when  visiting 
heads  of state need extraordinary security.  He was  immediately 
accosted  by  eager  subordinates.  The  onslaught  of  questions 
overwhelmed  him, so he ignored them and walked through the  maze 
directly to his office. 

His  head ringing, he plopped himself down behind his  desk.   He 
stared  at the two agents who followed him all the way, plus  his 
secretary  stood  in  the open  door,  watching  with  amusement.  
Duncan was not appreciative of panic situations.  His silence was 
contagious.

"Who's first?"  He asked quietly.

The  two agents looked at each other and one spoke. "Uh,  sir,  I 
think we have a lead in the blackmail operation."  Duncan  looked 
at the other, offering him a chance to speak.

"Yessir,  it  seems  to have broken all over  at  once."   Duncan 
opened his eyes wide in anticipation.  Well, he, thought, go on.

The first agent picked up the ball.  "Demands.  The  blackmailers 
are making demands.  So far we have six individuals who said they 
were  recontacted by the same person who had first called them  a 
year ago."

Duncan sat upright.  "I want a complete report, here, in 1  hour. 
We'll talk then.  Thank you gentlemen."   They took their cue  to 
exit  and  brushed by, Tyrone's secretary  on their way  out  the 
door.

"Yes, Gloria?"  Duncan treated her kindly, not with the  adminis-
trative brusqueness he often found necessary to motivate some  of 
his agents.

"Good  morning, or afternoon, sir.  Pleasant trip?"  She knew  he 
hated sudden trips to D.C.  It was her way of teasing her boss. 

"Wonderful!" Tyrone beamed with artificial enthusiasm.  "Book  me 
on  the  same flights every day for a month.   Definite  E-ticket 
ride."

"Do  you remember a Franklin Dobbs?  He was here some  time  ago, 
about, I believe the same matter you were just discussing?"   Her 
demureness pampered Duncan. 

"Dobbs? Yes, why?"

"He's  been  waiting all morning.  Had to see you,  no  on  else. 
Shall I show him in?"

"Yes, by all means, thank you."

"Mr.  Dobbs, how good to see you again.  Please," Duncan  pointed 
at  a  chair in front of his desk.  "Sit down.  How  may  I  help 
you?"

Dobbs  shuffled over to the chair and practically fell into   it.  
He sighed heavily and looked down at his feet.  "I guess it's all 
over.  All over."

"What do you mean?  My secretary, said you were being blackmailed 
again.   I  think you should know I'm not working  on  that  case 
anymore."

"This  time it's different," Dobbs said, his eyes darting  about.  
"They want money, a lot of money, more than we have.  Last time I 
received a call I was told some very private and specific  knowl-
edge  about  our company that  we preferred  to  remain  private.  
That  information contained all our pricing,  quotation  methods, 
profit  figures, overhead . . .everything our  competitors  could 
use."

"So  you  think  your competition is  blackmailing  you,"  Duncan 
offered.

"I  don't know.  If they wanted the information, why call me  and 
tell me?  We haven't been able to figure it out."

"What  about  the others," Duncan thought out loud.  "The  others 
with access to the information?"

"Everyone  is suspecting everyone else.  It's not healthy.   Now, 
after this, I'm thinking of packing  it in."

"Why now? What's different?"

"The demands.  I can't believe it's my competitors.  Sure, it's a 
cut throat business, but, no, it's hard to believe."

"Stranger  things have happened, Mr. Dobbs."  Duncan tried to  be 
soothing.  "The demands, what were they?"

"They  want  three million dollars, cash.  If we don't  pay  they 
said  they'd give away our company secrets  to  our  competitors.  
We don't have the cash."

Duncan felt for the man.  Dobbs had been right.  There was  noth-
ing the FBI could have done to help.  No demands, no  recontacts, 
and no leads, just a lot of suspicion.  But, now, the Bureau  was 
in a position to help.  

"Mr. Dobbs, rest assured, we will pursue this case  aggressively.  
We  will  assign you two of our top agents, and,  in  cases  like 
this,  we are quite successful."  Duncan's upbeat tone was  meant 
to lift Dobbs' spirits.  "Was there anything else demanded?"

"No, nothing, they just told me not to go to the police."

"You haven't told anyone, have you?"  Duncan asked.

"No, not even my wife."

"Mr.  Dobbs,  let me ask you a couple more things,  then  I  will 
introduce  you to some fine men who will help you.  Do  you  know 
anyone else who is in your position?  Other people who are  being 
blackmailed in similar ways?"

Dobbs  shuffled his feet under the chair, and picked at the  edge 
of the chair.  Duncan hit a raw nerve.  

"Mr.  Dobbs,  I don't want names, no specifics.  It's  a  general 
question.  Do you know others?"

"Yes," Dobbs said almost silently.

"Do  you  know how many?"  Duncan needed details if  his  current 
line of thinking would pan out into a viable theory.

"No, not exactly."

"Is it five?  Ten?  More than Ten? Twenty-five? More than twenty-
five?"  Dobbs nodded suddenly.

"Do  you mean that you know of 25 other companies that are  going 
through  what  you're going through?  Twenty five?"   Tyrone  was 
incredulous at the prospects.  The manpower alone to  investigate 
that many cases would totally overwhelm his staff.  There was  no 
way.  The ramifications staggered him.  Twenty five, all at once.

"Yeah. At least."

"I  know you can't tell me who they are . . ." Duncan hoped  that 
Dobbs might offer a few.

"No.  But,  look  at their stocks. They're not  doing  well.  Our 
competitors seem to be getting the best of the deal."

Twenty  five cases in New York alone, and he knows of at least  6 
others, so far.  The rekindled blackmail operation, after  months 
of  dead  ends.  Duncan wondered how big the monster  behind  the 
head  could  get.  And how could the FBI handle  it  all.    Poor 
bastard.  Poor us.

     Tuesday, December 15
     New York

It was before 8:00 A.M. and Scott cursed himself for arriving  at 
his office at this ungodly hour.  He had found the last piece  of 
the  puzzle, didn't sleep very much, and was in high gear  before 
6:00.   Scott couldn't remember the last time he had  been  awake 
this early, unless it was coming round the long way.  He scurried 
past security, shaking his ID card as he flew through the closing 
doors on the express elevator. The office hadn't yet come to life 
so Doug McGuire was available without a wait or interruption.

"I need some expense money," Scott blurted out at Doug. 

"Yeah,  so?"   Doug  sounded exasperated  with  Scott's  constant 
requests  for money.  He didn't even look up from his  impossibly 
disorganized desk.

"I'm serious . . .," Scott came back.

"So am I."  Doug firmly laid down his pen on his desk and  looked 
at  Scott.   "What the hell kind of expenses do  you  need  now?"  
Scott  spent more money than several reporters combined,  and  he 
never  felt  bad about it.  While a great deal of  his  work  was 
performed at the office or at home, his phone bills were extraor-
dinary as were his expenses.   

Scott  had developed a reputation as willing to go to almost  any 
lengths to get a story. Like the time he hired and the paper paid 
for  a call girl to entertain Congressman Daley  from  Wisconsin.  
She  was  supposed to confirm, in any way necessary,  that  LeMal 
Chemical was buying votes to help bypass certain approval  cycles 
for their new line of drugs.  She accidentally confirmed that  he 
was  a homosexual, but not before he slipped and the lady of  the 
evening became the much needed confirmation.

As Scott put it, Daley's embarrassed resignation was  unavoidable 
collateral  damage in stopping the approval of a drug  as  poten-
tially dangerous as thalidomide. 

Or  then there was the time that Scott received an anonymous  tip 
that the Oil Companies had suppressed critical  temperature-emis-
sion  ratio calculations, and therefore the extent of the  green-
house effect was being sorely underestimated.  As a result of his 
research and detective work, and the ability to verify and under-
stand the physics involved, Scott's articles forced a re-examina-
tion  of the dangers.  He received a New York Writer's Award  for 
that series.

When  Doug had hired Scott, as a thirty-something  cub  reporter, 
they  both  thought that Scott would fit in, nice and  neat,  and 
write  cute,  introspective technical pieces.   Neither  expected 
Scott  to  quickly  evolve into a innovative  journalist  on  the 
offensive who had the embryo of a cult following. 

But  Scott  Mason also performed a lot of the more  mundane  work 
that  most  writer's  suffer with until the  better  stories  can 
justify  their full time efforts. New products, whiz  bang  elec-
tronic  toys for the kitchen, whiz bangs for the  bathroom.   New 
computer this, new software that. 

Now,  though,  he was on the track, due in part he  admitted,  to 
Doug coercing him into writing the computer virus bits.  Yes,  he 
was wrong and Doug was right.  The pieces were falling in  place.  
So, no matter what happened, it was Doug's fault.

"I'm going to Europe." 

"No you're not!"  thundered Doug.

"Yes I am. I gotta go . . ."  Scott tried to plead his case.

"You  aren't  going anywhere, and that's final."   Doug  retorted 
without a pause.  He stared challengingly through Scott.

"Doug," Scott visibly calmed himself, "will you at least hear  me 
out,  before  telling me no?  At least listen to me, and  if  I'm 
wrong, tell me why.  O.K.?"  Same routine, different day, thought 
Scott.   The calmer, sincere request elicited empathy from  Doug.  
Maybe he'd been too harsh.  

"Sorry,  it's  automatic to say 'no'.  You know  that  they,"  he 
pointed  down  with  his thumb, "have us  counting  paper  clips.  
Sure, explain to me why I'm going to say 'no',"  he joked. Doug's 
overtly stern yet fatherlike geniality returned. 

"O.K."  Scott  mentally organized his thoughts.  He  touched  his 
fingers  to his forehead and turned to sit on the edge of  Doug's 
desk.  A traditional no-no. "Without my notes . . ."

"Screw the notes, what have you got? If you don't know the  mate-
rial, the notes won't help. They're the details, not the  story."  
Scott had heard this before.  

"Sure,  sorry." He gained confidence and went straight  from  the 
hip.   "Fact one.  The FBI is investigating a  massive  blackmail 
campaign  that  nobody wants us to talk about, and  probably  for 
good  reason from what I can see. As of now, there is no clue  at 
all to whom is behind the operation.

"Fact two. My story got pulled by CIA, NSA or someone that pushed 
the AG's buttons.  And this Tempest thing gets heads turning  too 
fast  for my taste."  Doug nodded briefly.  Scott made  sense  so 
far, both things were true.  

"Three,"  Scott  continued, "First State has been the  target  of 
hackers, plus, we have Sidneys . . ."

"Sort of.  McMillan hasn't caved in on that yet."

"Agreed,  but  it's still good.  You and I both know  it."   Doug 
grudgingly nodded in agreement.  

"Then we have all those papers that came from a van, or more than 
one van I would guess, and not a damned thing we can do with them 
according to Higgins."  Again, Doug nodded, but he wondered where 
all  of this was going.  "Then the EMP-T bombs, NASA,  the  Phone 
Company,  and all of these viruses.  What we have is a number  of 
apparently  dissimilar events that have one  common  denominator: 
computers."  

Scott  waited  for a reaction from Doug that didn't  come  so  he 
continued.   "Don't you see, the van with the computer data,  the 
endless  files,  the Sidneys problems, pulling  my  stories,  the 
hackers?  Even the viruses.  They're starting to get a little out 
of hand.  It's all the same thing!"

Doug  rolled his head from side to side on his shoulder.   Rather 
than boredom, Scott knew that Doug was carefully thinking through 
the logic of it.  "Aren't you acting the engineer instead of  the 
reporter here?  Miss the old line of work 'eh?"

"Give  me a break!  You and your viruses are the ones who got  me 
into this mess in the first place."  Scott knew it would come up, 
so  he had been ready and grabbed the opportunity Doug  had  just 
given  him.   "That's exactly the point!"  Scott leaped  off  the 
desk to his feet.  "All we have are technical threads, pieces  of 
a  puzzle.  It's a classic engineering problem."  Although  Scott 
had  never been a brilliant engineer, he could argue  the  issues 
fluently.

"Let me give you an example.  When I was in defense  electronics, 
whenever  someone  built something we had  to  document,  without 
failure,  it didn't work.  Radar, navigation, communications,  it 
didn't matter. The engineers forever were releasing products that 
failed  on  the first pass."  Doug stopped rolling his  head  and 
looked at Scott with a blank stare.

"We had these terrifically advanced products meant to defend  our 
country  and they didn't work.  So, we had to tell the  engineers 
what  was wrong so they could figure it out.  Our  own  engineers 
and  I got involved more times than we liked because the response 
time  from  the contractors was for shit.  They didn't  care  any 
more.   Since we hadn't designed it, we only saw the pieces  that 
were  on  the fritz, we had symptoms and had to figure  out  what 
they  meant in order to diagnose the failure so we could get  the 
designers  to  come  up with a fix.  The point is,  we  only  had 
shreds  of  evidence, little bits of technical  information  from 
which  to try to understand the complete system.  That's  exactly 
what's going on here."

"So?" Doug said dead panned.

"So," Scott avoided getting incensed. "You're damn lucky you have 
me  around.   I see a pattern, a trail, that leads I  don't  know 
where, but I have to follow the trail.  That's my job."

"What has Europe got to do with it?"  Doug was softening.

"Oops, thanks! I almost forgot."  Scott felt stupid for a second, 
but  he  was without notes, he rationalized. "Kirk is  my  hacker 
contact who I've been talking to over my computer. Gives me  real 
good stuff.  He says there's a conference of hackers in Amsterdam 
next week.  It's a real private affair, and he got me an  invite. 
I think, no I know, there's something bigger going down;  somehow 
all of these pieces tie together and I need to find out how."

"That's it?"  Scott looked disappointed at Doug's reaction.  

"No, that's not it!  You know that the Expos‚ has been publishing 
bits and pieces of the same stuff we haven't been publishing?"

Scott didn't know which of his arguments made the case, but  Doug 
certainly reacted to the competitive threat.  "How much?"

"How much what?"  Scott wasn't ready for the question.

"For Europe?  How much play money will you need.  You know I have 
to sell this upstairs and they  . . ."

"Airfare  and a couple of nights plus food.  That's it.   If  you 
want,"   Scott  readied the trump card he had never used  at  the 
Times.  "I'll  pay for it myself, and submit it all when  I  come 
back.  Then, you make the call. I'll trust you."

"You really think it's that important?"  Doug said.

"Absolutely.   No  question.  Something's going  on  that  smells 
rotten,  bad, and it includes the Government, but I have no  idea 
how."   Scott spoke as if he was on a soapbox.  He had  shot  his 
wad.  That was it.  Anything more was a rehash of the same  stuff 
and  it  would have been worthless to say more.  He shut  up  and 
waited  for Doug who enjoyed making his better reporters  anxious 
with anticipation.

"Have  a good trip,"  Doug said nonchalantly.  He leaned  forward 
to  hunch  over  his desk, and ignoring Scott, he  went  back  to 
redlining another writer's story.

     Tuesday, December 15
     Scarsdale, New York

Kirk  delivered  on his word.  In his E-Mail  repository  at  the 
Times,  Scott found a message from Kirk.  It was short,  but  all 
Scott needed to hear.  Never mind how Kirk broke into the comput-
ers.

     Tues.  12/15  00:02:14.1
     << FREEDOM BBS >>

Repo Man,  

When  you  arrive, call 602-356.  It's an Amsterdam  number.  Jon 
Gruptmann is your contact.  I told him you were a reporter, but a 
good one. I said you're working to preserve freedom of electronic 
information  and you were sick and tired of the police and  media 
beating up on hackers.  He thinks you want to give the other side 
of the story to the public. 

Jon is one of the best in Holland and  anywhere.  
He  agreed to meet and talk with you himself.  He will  show  you 
around. Have a good trip.  Call me, oops, no can do.  

Oh, Yes.  Mona Lisa frowned. I will call you.

Kirk

     << TRANSMITTED BY THE FREEDOM BBS SERVICE >>

When Scott got home from work he checked his E-mail and found the 
same  message from Kirk, telling him to be on the  line  tonight.  
The  Mona  Lisa frowned.  That meant to Scott  that  someone  was 
interested enough in Kirk's activities, or alleged activities  at 
First State to break in and ruin his computers.  And Da  Vinci's.  
Who was so scared of hackers, or of what they knew to go to these 
lengths?  How many have had their computers ravaged? 

As anticipated, midnight brought Kirk calling.

WE'RE GOING AFTER THEM

After who?

FREEDOM.   NEMO AND SOME PHREAKS PHRIENDS ARE GOING TO  FIND  OUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON.

What's wrong?

DID  YOU EVER TALK TO ANYONE AND FEEL THAT THINGS  WEREN'T  QUITE 
RIGHT?

Sure.

WELL  SO DO I.  DA VINCI IS A STRAIGHT WHITE HAT HACKER.   I  HAD 
HIM  CHECKED OUT BY PHRIENDS.  THEN I CALLED FREEDOM  AND  JOINED 
UP.  I GAVE THEM A BUNCH OF SOFTWARE AND I TOOK SOME.  I ASKED TO 
CHAT WITH THE SYSOP AND WE'VE BEEN  TALKING DAILY.  STRANGE GUY.

Strange? Over a computer?

YOU CAN TELL.  HE SPOKE WITH AN ACCENT.

You're putting me on.  

REALLY.   EVER  READ A VCR MANUAL TRANSLATED FROM  THE  JAPANESE?  
THEY LEAVE OUT THE the's FROM EVERYTHING.  IT HAS AN ACCENT.  AND 
THE WORD DUDE ESPECIALLY UPSET HIM.  

Dude?  Good reason to be suspicious.

THEN I HACKED HIS SYSTEM WHEN I KNEW HE WASN'T ON LINE.  JUST  TO 
LOOK AROUND MIND YOU.  

How can you do that?

BBS'S  ONLY  COME  IN SO MANY FLAVORS.  THEY'RE  PRETTY  EASY  TO 
CRACK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A COPY TO WORK ON.

Ah hah!

I FOUND HUGE AREAS OF HIS COMPUTER NOT ASSIGNED TO THE BBS.

So?

A BBS COMPUTER IS DEDICATED TO ONE FUNCTION, BBS'ING.  SO I POKED 
AROUND  AND FOUND ANOTHER COMPLETE BBS SYSTEM, NOT PART OF  FREE-
DOM.   TOO  MUCH WAS ENCRYPTED, THOUGH, TO LEARN  MUCH.   BUT  WE 
WILL.

Don't get yourself into hot water again . . .

NOT TO WORRY.  I'LL BECOME ONE OF THEM.  PLAY THEIR GAMES.   IT'S 
EASY TO BE ANYONE YOU WANT.  I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND 
THE SCENES.  SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

     U.S. Army on Virus Vigil!
     by Scott Mason

In July of 1990, the United States Army joined the inner  sanctum 
of the Computer Hacker.  

The Pentagon had finally realized that the computer is as  essen-
tial  to battlefield operations and communications as is the  gun 
and the radio.

Therefore,  as  the logic goes, why shouldn't  the  computers  be 
directly attacked as are other military targets.  In keeping with 
that  line  of  thinking, the Army said,  use  computer  viruses.  
Viruses are those little gremlins which roam throughout a comput-
er  system,  hiding  themselves in silicon  gulches,  waiting  to 
ambush mountains of megabytes and erase deserts of data.  Perfect 
for modern warfare.

The Army issued an RFP, (Request For Proposal) asking the private 
sector to study and design computer viruses and other methods  to 
be  used offensively against enemy computers.  The  half  million 
dollar contract was awarded to a Beltway Bandit, a small  govern-
ment  sub-contractor so named for their proximity  to  Interstate 
495, which loops around Washington, D.C.  

So, the Army is going into the hacking business, but this  brings 
up quite a few questions. 

Question  I.   How long has the Government  known  that  computer 
viruses and other maladies could be used in a strategic militari-
ly offensive fashion?  RFP's are always preceded by much internal 
research  and consultation with private industry. The  Government 
typically will have issued RFI's, (Requests For Information)  and 
RFQ's  (Request For Quotes) and already have a darn good idea  of 
what's available and from whom.  

Question II.  Has the Government already sponsored such research?  
The existence of the EMP-T Bomb has created quite a furor.

Question  III.   What if the Army created  experimental  computer 
viruses and they get loose?  Who is responsible for silicon based 
biological warfare on desktop computers?

Question  IV.   Have any computer viral outbreaks  actually  been 
Government projects  gone out of control?

Question  V.  If the Government knew that civilian  and  military 
computers  could  be systematically attacked and  destroyed,  why 
haven't  we done anything to defend ourselves against  a  similar 
assault?

Last  month's attack on the Stock Exchange by secret EMP-T  bombs 
prompted  an investigation into such military  capabilities,  and 
some surprising answers were uncovered.

In  an  attempt to get specific answers from  various  Government 
agencies, I located a secretive group called OCTAG/0N. (Offensive 
Computer Technology Applications Group/Zero-November).   OCTAG/0N 
is a highly classified interagency project whose sole function is 
to  develop  methods to destroy or disable computers  from  great 
distances.  

According  to  a highly placed source at the  Pentagon,  OCTAG/0N 
allegedly  developed computer viruses that will destroy the  ene-
my's hard disks.  Successful deployment, to use Pentagon-ese,  is 
the  hard part.  "If we can get at their computers," an  engineer 
with  OCTAG/0N said requesting anonymity, "we can stop  them  in-
stantly.   Getting them there has been the problem.  But  now  we 
know how to get at their computers from great distances."

In the battlefield, for example, advanced tactical communications 
groups  explode  small  Magnetic Bombs (EMP-T)  which  emit  very 
strong  electromagnetic  pulses at certain frequencies.   The  EM 
pulses  destroy  nearby  computers, (RAM,  ROM,  EPROM,  Magnetic 
storage).   Some  computer  systems  are  'hardened'  with  extra 
shielding  as in the Tempest program.  Other computers,  such  as 
those in Air Force One, inside missile silos, or in the  Pentagon 
War  Room are additionally protected by the secret  C3I  programs 
which 'super-hardens' the computers against the intense  magnetic 
pulses associated with above ground nuclear explosions.

Intensely focussed energy beams of low power can totally  disrupt 
an unshielded computer as far away as three miles.   Synchronized 
Interference Techniques provide double duty to both listen in  on 
and jam air borne computer traffic.  One of OCTAG/0N's pet tricks 
is to broadcast a computer virus  from a small antenna so that it 
is caught by a computers communicating on the same frequency.  So 
simple, yet so devious.

In conversations with computer experts and the underground hacker 
community,  the  existence of such high tech  weaponry  has  been 
confirmed, although the Department of Defense is still issuing  a 
predictable 'no comment'.

So, I have to ask again.  Why hasn't our Government been  helping 
us  protect ourselves against an apparently  formidable  computer 
weapons  complement?   I  hope "The Other Guys"  aren't  so  well 
armed.

This is Scott Mason, adding a chastity belt to my modem.

     A/K/A Software
     by Scott Mason

The Christmas Virus is upon is.  So is the anticipated New  Years 
Eve and New Year's Day Virus.  

Seems  like wherever I look, someone is making a virus to  attack 
my computer or celebrate a holiday.

Rather than another rash of warnings about the impending doom and 
gloom  faced  by your computers, my editor asked me to  find  the 
lighter  side of computer viruses.  I strongly objected,  stating 
that I found nothing amusing about them.  They were a deadly  and 
cowardly  form of terrorism that should be rewarded with  behead-
ing.

However, there is one thing . . .

The  geniuses  who come up with the names for  viral  infections; 
about as believable and laughable as a Batman comic. 

I wonder what most of us would think if our doctor told us we had 
the Ping Pong virus instead of strep throat.   Or in spring  time 
we contracted the April Fool's Virus. 

It is entirely within the realm of reason that America's  comput-
ers go unprotected because of the sheer absurdity of the names we 
attach to each one.  Comical names create a comical situation, so 
no one takes the issue seriously.

The Marijuana virus conjures up images of a stoned orgy, and  why 
would  a computer care about that.  The Fu Manchu virus  conjures 
up the Red Chinese Army crossing the Mississippi, which is clear-
ly not the case, so it is ignored.

Viruses  know  no national boundary.  The  Pakistani  virus,  the 
Icelandic,  the Israeli, Jerusalem A, Jerusalem B,  Jerusalem  C, 
Lehigh,  Alameda,  Vienna,  Czech, Rumanian - I  found  over  900 
current  and active viruses that are identified by their  reputed 
place of origin.  

The  Brain virus sounds more sinister than the Stoned Virus,  and 
Friday the 13th viruses are as popular as the movie sequels.  The 
Columbus  Day  Virus was actually dubbed by its authors  as  Data 
Crime, and might have generated more concern if not for the nick-
nom-de-plume it inherited.

So  to fulfill my editor's dream, I will list a few of  the  more 
creative  virus  names.   Some were chosen  by  the  programmers, 
others  by the Virus Busters and others yet by the  media.    See 
what  you think each virus would do to your computer, or when  it 
will strike, merely from the name.

     The Vatican Virus		       The Popeye Virus  
     The Garlic Virus		       The Scrooge Virus
     Teenage Mutant Ninja Virus	       The Ides Virus	
     The Quaalude Virus		       The Amphetamine Virus
     Super Virus		       The Tick Tock Virus
     The String Virus		       The Black Hole Virus
     The Stupid Virus		       Stealth

I have a few of my own suggestions for future virus builders.

The Jewish Sex Virus (Dials your mother-in-law during a  romantic 
interlude.)

The  Ronald  Reagan Virus (Puts your computer to  sleep  only  in 
important meetings.)

The Pee Wee Herman Virus (Garbage In Garbage Out)

The  Donald Trump Virus (Makes all of your spread sheets go  into 
the red.)

Tomorrow, Viruses from Hell on Geraldo.

Namely, this is Scott Mason.

     Tuesday, December 29
     Washington, D.C.

"Why the hell do I have to find out what's going on in the  world 
from  the  goddamned papers and CNN instead of  from  the  finest 
intelligence  services  in  the world?"   The  President  snapped 
sarcastically  while sipping black coffee over his daily  collec-
tion of U.S. and foreign papers.  

The early morning ritual of coffee, newspapers and a briefing  by 
Chief  of  Staff  Phil Musgrave provided the day  with  a  smooth 
start.  Usually.

"I've been asking for weeks about this computer craziness.  All I 
get is don't worry, Mr. President," he said mimicking the classic 
excuses he was sick and tired of hearing.  "We have it taken care 
of,  Mr. President.  No concern of yours, Mr. President, we  have 
everything under control.  We temporarily have our thumbs up  our 
asses, Mr. President."  Phil stifled a giggle behind his napkin.

"I'm sorry, Phil," the President continued, "but it irritates the 
shit  out of me.   The damn media knowing more about what's  hap-
pening  than we do.  Where the hell is that report I  asked  for?  
The  one  on the bank hostage I've been requesting for  a  week?"  
The President's mood portended a rough day for the inner circle.

"Sir, as I understand, it wasn't ready for your desk yet."

"Do  the goddamned missiles have to land on the White House  lawn 
before we verify it's not one of our own?"  

Phil  knew better than to attempt any dissuasion when the  Presi-
dent got into these moods.  He took notes, and with luck it would 
blow over in a couple of days.  Today was not Phil's lucky day.

"I want a briefing.  Two Hours."

"Gentlemen," the President said from behind his desk in the  oval 
office,  "I'd like to read you something I had Brian put  togeth-
er."   The efficiency of the White House Press Office  under  the 
leadership  of Brian Packard was well known.  The  President  had 
the  best  rapport  with the press that any President  had  in  a 
generation.

He  slipped on his aviator style glasses and pulled the  lobe  of 
his  left  ear while reading from his desk.  "Let's  start  here.  
Phone  Company Invaded by Hackers; Stock Exchange Halted by  Gov-
ernment  Bomb; Computer Crime Costs Nation $12 Billion  Annually;  
Viruses  Stop Network;   Banks Lose Millions to  Computer  Embez-
zlers;  Trojan Horse Defeats Government Computers; NASA  Spending 
Millions  On Free Calls for Hackers."  He looked for  a  reaction 
from  his  four key associates: Phil,  Quinton  Chambers,  Martin 
Royce and Henry Kennedy.  "If you don't know, these are headlines 
from newspapers and magazines across the country."

The  President  read  further from his  notes.   "Viruses  Infect 
Trans-Insurance  Payments; Secret Service Computers Invaded;  NSA 
and  NIST  in  Security Rift; FBI Wasting  Millions  on  Computer 
Blackmail  Scheme; First National Bank Held Hostage;  Sperm  Bank 
Computer  Records  Erased; IRS Returns of the Super  Rich."   The 
President removed his glasses wanting answers. 

"What is going on here, gentlemen?" the President asked directly.  
"I  am baffled that everyone else but me seems to know there's  a 
problem, and that pisses me off.  Answers?"

He wondered who would be the first to speak up.  Surprisingly, it 
was  Henry,  who normally waited to speak last.   "Sir,  we  have 
active programs in place to protect classified computer systems."

"Then  what  are these about?"  He waved a couple  of  sheets  of 
paper in the air.

"Of course we haven't fully implemented security everywhere  yet, 
but  it  is an ongoing concern.  According to NSA,  the  rash  of 
recent  computer  events are a combination of anomalies  and  the 
press blowing it all out of proportion."

"Do  you  believe Henry," the President asked, "that  if  there's 
smoke, a reasonable man will assume that there is a fire nearby?"  
Henry nodded obligingly.  "And what would you think if there were 
a hundred plumes of smoke rising?"

Henry  felt stumped.  "Jacobs assured me that he  had  everything 
under control and . . ."

"As I recall Henry," the President interrupted, "you told me that 
a couple of months ago when the papers found out about the  EMP-T 
bombs.  Do you recall, Henry?"  

"Yessir," he answered meekly. 

"Then what happened?"

"We have to rely on available information, and as far as we know, 
as far as we're being told, these are very minor events that have 
been sensationalized by the media."

"It says here," the President again donned his glasses,  "Defense 
Contractors  Live  with  Hackers; Stealth  Program  Uncovered  in 
Defense Department Computers; Social Security Computers At  Risk. 
Are  those  minor events?"  He pointed the question at  not  only 
Henry.

"There was no significant loss of information," Coletree  rapidly 
said.   "We  sewed up the holes before we were  severely  compro-
mised."

"Wonderful,"  the President said sarcastically.  "And  what  ever 
happened to that bank in Atlanta?  Hiring Those kids?"

"If I may, sir?"  Phil Musgrave filled the silence.  "That was  a 
private concern, and we had no place to interfere - as is true in 
most of these cases.  We can only react if government property is 
affected."

"What is being done about it?  Now I mean."

"We  have  activated CERT and ECCO,  independent  computer  crime 
units to study the problem further."  As usual, Phil was impecca-
bly  informed.  "Last years the Secret Service and  FBI  arrested 
over 70 people accused of computer crimes.  The state of Pennsyl-
vania  over 500, California 300.  Remember, sir, computer  crimes 
are generally the states' problems."

"I'm  wondering if it shouldn't be our problem, too," the  Presi-
dent pondered.

"There  are  steps  in that direction, as well.   Next  week  the 
Senate hearings on Privacy and Technology Containment begin,  and 
as I understand it, they will be focusing on exactly this issue."

"Who's running the show?"  the President asked with interest.

"Ah," Phil said ripping through his notes, "Rickfield, sir."

"That bigot?  Christ.  I guess it could be worse.  We could  have 
ended up with Homer Simpson."    The easing of tension worked  to 
the President's advantage, for a brief moment.  "I want the whole 
picture,  the good and the bad, laid out for me." He scanned  his 
private  appointment book.  "Two weeks.  Is that long  enough  to 
find out why I'm always the last to know?"

     New York

"Scott Mason," Scott said answering the phone with his mouth full 
of hot pastrami on rye with pickles and mayonnaise.

"Scott?   It's Tyrone."  Tyrone's voice was quiet, just  about  a 
whisper.

"Oh,  hi."   Scott continued to chew.  Scott  was  unsuccessfully 
trying not to sound angry.   

Other than following Scott's articles in the paper, they had  had 
no  contact  since that eventful phone call a month  ago.   Since 
then, Scott had made sure that they rode on different cars during 
their  daily commute into the city.  It was painful for  both  of 
them  since  they had been close friends, but Scott  was  morally 
obligated,  so  he thought, to cut off  their  association  after 
Tyrone  broke  the cardinal rule of all  journalists;  keep  your 
sources protected.  And, Tyrone had broken that maxim. Scott  had 
not  yet learned that the Bureau made their own rules,  and  that 
the  gentleman's agreement of off-the-record didn't carry  weight 
in their venue.

"How  have you been?"  Tyrone said cordially.  "Good bit of  work 
you been doing."

"Yeah, thanks, thanks,"  Scott  said stiffly.  

Tyrone  had  already determined that he needed Scott if  his  own 
agency wouldn't help him.  At least Scott wasn't bound by idiotic 
governmental  regulations  that stifled rather  than  helped  the 
cause.  Maybe there was hope for cooperation yet, if  his  little 
faux pas could be forgiven.

"We need to talk.  I've been meaning to call you."  Though Tyrone 
meant it, Scott thought it was a pile of warmed up FBI shit.

"Sure,  let's  talk."   Scott's  apparent  indifference  bothered 
Tyrone.

"Scott,  I  mean it," he said sincerely.  "I have an  apology  to 
make, and I want to do it in person.  Also, I think that we  both 
need  each  other . . .you'll understand when I tell  you  what's 
been  going on."  Tyrone's deep baritone voice  conveyed  honesty 
and a little bit of urgency.  If nothing else, he had never known 
or  had any reason to suspect Tyrone of purposely  misleading  or 
lying  to him.  And their friendship had been a good one.   Plus, 
the tease of a secret further enticed Scott into agreeing.

"Yeah,  what the hell.  It's Christmas."  Scott's aloofness  came 
across as phony, but Tyrone understood the awkwardness and let it 
pass.

"How 'bout we meet at The Oyster Bar, Grand Central, and get shit 
faced.  Merry Christmas from the Bureau."

The  Oyster Bar  resides on the second lower level of Grand  Cen-
tral  Station, located eighty feet beneath Park Avenue and  42nd. 
Street. It had become a fairly chic restaurant bar in the  '80's; 
the seafood was fresh, and occasionally excellent. The  patronage 
of the bar ranged from the commuter who desperately quaffed  down 
two  or three martinis to those who enjoyed the  seafaring  ambi-
ence.   The  weathered hardwood walls were  decorated  with  huge 
stuffed crabs, swordfish, lifesavers and a pot pourri of  fishing 
accouterments.   The  ceilings were bathed in worn  fishing  nets 
that occasionally dragged too low for anyone taller than 6 feet. 

Away  from the bar patrons could dine or drink in  privacy,  with 
dim  ten  watt lamps on each table to cut through  the  darkness.  
Tyrone  was  sitting at such a table, drink in  hand  when  Scott 
craned  his  neck from the door to find his  friend  through  the 
crowd.  He ambled over, and Tyrone stood to greet him.  Scott was 
cool, but willing to give it a try.  As usual Tyrone was elegant-
ly  attired,  in a custom tailored dark gray pin stripe  suit,  a 
fitted designer shirt and a stylish silk tie of the proper width.

Scott  was  dressed just fine as far as he  was  concerned.   His 
sneakers were clean, his jeans didn't have holes and the  sweater 
would  have gained him admission to the most private ski  parties 
in  Vermont. Maybe they were too different and  their  friendship 
had been an unexplainable social aberration; an accident.

Scott's stomach tightened.  His body memory recalled the time the 
principal had suspended him from high school for spreading liquid 
banana  peel on the hall floors and then ringing the  fire  drill 
alarm.   The picture of 3000 kids and 200 teachers  slipping  and 
sliding and crawling out of the school still made Scott smile.  

"What'll  you  have?" Tyrone gestured at a  waiter  while  asking 
Scott for his preference.

"Corona, please."

Tyrone  took  charge. "Waiter, another double and a  Corona."  He 
waved  the  waiter  away. "That's better."   Tyrone  was  already 
slightly  inebriated.  "I guess you think I'm a real  shit  hole, 
huh?"

"Sort  of,"  Scott agreed. "I guess you could put it  that  way." 
Scott was impressed with Ty's forthright manner.  "I can think of 
a bunch more words that fit the bill."  At least Tyrone  admitted 
it.  That was a step in the right direction.

Ty  laughed.  "Yeah, I bet you could, and you  might  be  right."  
Scott's  drink came.  He took a thirsty gulp from the  long  neck 
bottle."

"Ease  on  down the road!"  Ty held his half empty drink  in  the 
air.   It was peace offering.  Scott slowly lifted his and  their 
drinks  met  briefly.   They both sipped again,  and  an  awkward 
silence followed.

"Well,  I guess it's up to me to explain, isn't it?" Tyrone  ven-
tured.

"You  don't have to explain anything. I understand,"  Scott  said 
caustically.

"I  don't think you do, my friend.  May I at least have  my  last 
words before you shoot?"  Tyrone's joviality was not as effective 
when nervous.

Scott  remembered that he used the same argument with  Doug  only 
days before.  He eased up. "Sure, ready and aimed, though."

"I'm  quitting."  Tyrone's face showed  disappointment,  resigna-
tion.

The  beer bottle at Scott's lips was abruptly laid on the  table.  
"Quitting?   The  FBI?"  Tyrone nodded.  "Why?   What  happened?"  
For one moment Scott completely forgot how angry he was.  

The  din of the Oyster Bar made for excellent cover.  They  could 
speak freely with minimal worry of being overheard.

"It's  a long story, but it began when they pulled your  article.  
God,  I'm sorry, man," Tyrone said with empathy.  The furrows  on 
his  forehead deepened as he searched for a reaction from  Scott.  
Nothing.

Ty  finished  off his drink and started on the  refill.   "Unlike 
what you probably believe, or want to believe, when you called me 
that morning, I had no idea what you were talking about.  It  was 
several  hours before I realized what had happened. If I had  any 
idea . . ."

Scott  stared  blankly  at Tyrone. You haven't  convinced  me  of 
anything, Scott thought.

"As  far as I knew, you were writing an article that had no  par-
ticular consequence . . ."

"Thanks a shitload," Scott quipped.

"No,  I  mean, I had  no idea of the national  security  implica-
tions, and besides, it was going to be in the paper the next  day 
anyway."  Tyrone  shrugged with his hands in the  air  for  added 
emphasis.  "Tempest meant nothing to me. All I said was that  you 
and I had been talking.  I promise you, that's it.  As a  friend, 
that  was  the extent of it.  They took it from  there."   Tyrone 
extended  his hands in an open gesture of conciliation.   "All  I 
knew  was that what you'd said about CMR shook some people up  in 
D.C..   ECCO  has been quite educational.  Now I  know  why,  and 
that's why I have to leave."

The  genuineness from Tyrone softened Scott's attitude some.   "I 
thought you spooks stuck together.  Spy and die together."

Tyrone  contorted  his face to show disgust  with  that  thought.  
"That'll  be the day. In fact it's the opposite.  A third of  our 
budgets  are meant to keep other agencies in the dark about  what 
we're doing."

"You're kidding!"  

"I wish I was."  Tyrone looked disheartened, betrayed.  

"At any rate," Tyrone continued, "I got spooked by the stunt with 
your  paper and the Attorney General.  I just couldn't call  you, 
you'll  see why.  The Agency is supposed to enforce the law,  not 
make  it and they have absolutely no business screwing  with  the 
press. Uh-uh."  Tyrone took a healthy sip of his drink.  "Reminds 
me of times that are supposed to be gone. Dead in the past.   Did 
you know that I am a constitutional lawyer?"

Scott ordered another beer and shook his head, no. Just a regular 
lawyer.  Will wonders never cease?

"Back  in  the  early 60's the South was not  a  good  place  for 
blacks.   Or Negroes as we were called back then."   Tyrone  said 
the  word Negro with disdain.  He pulled his tie from  the  stiff 
collar and opened a button.  "I went on some marches in  Alabama, 
God, that was a hot summer. A couple of civil rights workers were 
killed."

Scott  remembered.  More from the movie Mississippi Burning  than 
from memory. 

Civil rights wasn't a black-white issue, Tyrone insisted. It  was 
about  man's  peaceful  co-existence with  government.   A  legal 
issue.  "I  thought that was an important  distinction  and  most 
people were missing the point.  I thought I could make a  differ-
ence working from inside the system.  I was wrong, and I've  been 
blinded by it until now . . .you know.

"When I was in college the politicians screamed integration while 
the  poor  blacks no more wanted to be bussed to the  rich  white 
neighborhood that the rich whites wanted the poor blacks in their 
schools."  Tyrone spoke from his heart, his soul, with a touch of 
resentment  that Scott had not seen before.  But then,  they  had 
never  spoken of it before. This was one story that he  had  suc-
cessfully  neglected  to share. "Forced integration  was  govern-
ment's answer to a problem it has never understood.

"It's about dignity.  Dignity and respect, not government  inter-
vention.   It's about a man's right to privacy and the  right  to 
lead his life the way he sees fit.  Civil rights is about how  to 
keep  government from interfering with its citizens.   Regardless 
of color."  Tyrone was adamant.

"And  that's why you're gonna  quit?"  Scott didn't see the  con-
nection.

"No, goddamnit, no," Tyrone shouted.  "Don't you get it?"   Scott 
shook  his head.  "They want to take them away."  He  spoke  with 
finality and assumed Scott knew what he meant.  The liquor fogged 
his brain to mouth speech connection.

"Who's  gonna take what away?"  Scott asked, frustrated  by  Ty's 
ramblings.

"I  know it's hokey, but the Founding Fathers had a plan, and  so 
far it's survived two hundred years of scrutiny and division.   I 
would  like  to think it can survive the computer  age."   Tyrone 
quieted  down some.  "My father used to tell me, from the time  I 
was  old enough to understand, that law was merely a  measure  of 
how  much freedom a man was willing to sacrifice to  maintain  an 
orderly society."

"My  father was a radical liberal among liberals," Tyrone  remem-
bered.  "Even today he'll pick a fight at the family barbecue for 
his own entertainment.  And he'll hold his own."

Scott  enjoyed the image of a crotchety octogenarian stirring  up 
the shit while his children isolated their kids from their  grand 
father's intellectual lunacy.  What was this about?

Tyrone  caught  himself and realized that he wasn't  getting  his 
point  across.  He took a deep  breath and slouched back  in  the 
chair that barely held him.

"From the beginning," he said.  "I told you about ECCO, and  what 
a  disaster it is.  No authority, no control, no  responsibility.  
And the chaos is unbelievable. 

"I don't pretend to understand all of the computer jargon, but  I 
do recognize when the NSA wants to control everything.  There's a 
phenomenal  amount  of  arrogance there.  The NSA  reps  in  ECCO 
believe  that  they  are the only ones who  know  anything  about 
computers  and  how to protect them.  I feel sorry for  the  guys 
from NIST.  They're totally underfunded, so they end up with both 
the grunt work and the brunt of the jokes from the NSA.  

"NSA  won't cooperate on anything.  If NIST says it's white,  NSA 
says  it's black.  If NIST says there's room to  compromise,  NSA 
gets  more stubborn. And the academic types.  At long last I  now 
know  what happened to the hippies:  they're all government  con-
sultants  through   universities.   And all they want  to  do  is 
study,  study, study.  But they never come up with answers,  just 
more questions to study.  

"The  vendors try to sell their products and don't  contribute  a 
damn  thing,"  sighed  Tyrone.  "A bunch of  industry  guys  from 
computer  companies  and the banks, and they're as baffled  as  I 
am."

"So why quit?  Can't you make a difference?"

"Listen.  The FBI views computer crimes as inter-state in  nature 
and therefore under their domain."

Scott nodded in understanding. 

"We  are  enforcement, only," Tyrone asserted.  "We do  not,  nor 
should  we make the laws.  Separation of power; Civics  101.   To 
accomplish anything, I have to be a private citizen." 

"What do you want to accomplish?"  asked Scott with great  inter-
est.

"I want to stop the NSA."  Tyrone spoke bluntly and Scott sat too 
stunned to speak for long seconds.

"From what?"  A sudden pit formed in Scott's stomach.

"I found out why they dumped on you about the CMR," Tyrone  said.  
"I  haven't been able to tell you before, but it  doesn't  matter 
any  more."  Tyrone quickly shook off the veiling sadness.   "NSA 
has  a built-in contradiction.  On one hand they listen into  the 
world  and spy for America.  This is supposed to be very  secret, 
especially how they do it.  It turns out that CMR is one of their 
'secret' methods for spying on friends and foes alike.

"So, to keep our friends and foes from spying on us, they  create 
the  secret Tempest program.  Except, they think it needs  to  be 
kept  a military secret, and the public sector be  damned.   They 
actually believe that opening the issue to the public will hamper 
their intelligence gathering capabilities because the enemy  will 
protect against it, too."

Scott listened in fascination. What he was learning now more than 
made up for the loss of one article.  He felt bad now that he had 
overreacted and taken it out on Tyrone.

"Same goes for the EMP-T bomb," Tyrone added.  "Only they  didn't 
know  that you were going to publish ahead of time like they  did 
when I opened up my fat trap."

Scott's eyes suddenly lit up. "How much did you tell them?"

"That I knew you and you were writing an article. That's it." 

"Then how did they know what I had written?  It was pretty damned 
close.  I assumed that you had . . ."

"No way, man," Tyrone held his hands up.

"Then how did . . .Ty? What if they're using CMR on my computers?  
Could they . . ."

Tyrone's  predicament was to decide whether or not to tell  Scott 
that  he knew the NSA and others spied on Americans and  gathered 
intelligence  through  remote control means.  "I  assume  they're 
capable of anything."

"Shit!"  Scott  exclaimed.  "Privacy goes right out  the  window.  
Damn."   Scott rapidly spun in his chair and vacantly stared  off 
in space.  "Is that legal?"

"What?  CMR?  I looked into that briefly, and there's nothing  on 
the  books  yet, but I did find out that tapping  cellular  phone 
conversations is legal."

"Phone tapping, legal?"  Scott couldn't believe his ears.

"Cellular phones, yeah.  The FCC treats them like TV sets,  radi-
os, satellites.  Anyone  can listen to any station."

"That's  incredible,"  Scott said, mouth gaping.  "I  wonder  how 
they'll handle RF LAN's."

"RF LAN's," asked Ty.  "What are those?"

"A  bunch of computers tied together with radios.   They  replace 
the  wires that connect computers now.  Can you imagine?"   Scott 
saw  the  irony in it.  "Broadcasting your private  secrets  like 
that?  Hah!  Or if you have your own RF network, all you have  to 
do  is dial up another one and all the information ends up  right 
in  your  computer! Legal robbery.  Is this a  great  country  or 
what?"

"Now  you know why I'm leaving.  The NSA cannot be  permitted  to 
keep the public uninformed about vulnerabilities to their person-
al  freedom.  And hiding under the umbrella of national  security 
gets old.  A handful of paranoid un-elected, un-budgeted, non-ac-
countable,  mid-level  bureaucrats  are deciding  the  future  of 
privacy  and freedom in this country.  They are the ones who  are 
saying, 'no, no problem,' when they know damn well it is a  prob-
lem.  What they say privately is in diametric opposition to their 
public statements and positions."

Scott stifled a nervous laugh.  Who wound Tyrone up?  A conspira-
cy theory.  Tyrone was drunk.  "Don't you think that maybe you're 
taking  this a little far," he suggested. For the first  time  in 
years the shoe was on the other foot.  Scott was tempering  some-
body elses extremes.  

"Why the hell do you think there's so much confusion at ECCO  and 
CERT and the other computer SWAT teams?  NSA interferes at  every 
step,"  Tyrone responded.  "And no, I am not taking this too far.  
I  haven't taken it far enough.  I sit with these guys  and  they 
talk as though I'm not there.  I attend meetings where the  poli-
cies and goals of ECCO are established.   Shit, I trust the dope-
smoking  hippies from Berkeley more than anyone from  the  Fort."  
The  bitterness  came  through clearly, but Scott  could  see  it 
wasn't focussed on any one person or thing.  

But  Scott  began to understand.  For over 20  years  Tyrone  had 
insulated himself from the politics of the job and had seen  only 
what  he  wanted to see; a national Police  Force  enforcing  the 
laws.  Tyrone loved the chase of the crime.  The bits and pieces, 
the  endless  sifting of evidence, searching for clues  and  then 
building a case from shreds.  The forensics of modern criminology 
had  been so compelling for Tyrone Duncan that he had missed  the 
impact  that the mass proliferation of technology would  have  on 
his first love - The Constitution.  

The sudden revelations and realizations of the last several weeks 
set his mind into high gear. Tyrone introspectively examined  his 
beliefs;  he  tried  to review them from the  perspective  of  an 
idealistic  young man in his twenties.  What would he  have  done 
then?  He realized the answer was easier found now that he was  a 
man of experience:  Do Something About It.

Far  from a rebel looking for a cause, the cause jumped all  over 
Tyrone with a vengeance and the tenacity of a barnacle.  

All at once Scott knew that Tyrone was serious and that he  would 
be a better friend if he congratulated instead of castigated.

"You know, I kind of understand a little.  Same thing with my ex- 
wife."

"Hey, that's not fair, man," Tyrone vigorously objected.  "Maggie 
was a dingbat . . ."

"I know that and she knew that," Scott agreed, "but that was what 
made  her Maggie."  Tyrone nodded, remembering her antics.   "And 
in  some ways we still love each other.  After ten years of  fun, 
great  fun, she wanted to get off of the planet more than I  did, 
so  she went to California."  The softness in Scott's voice  said 
he still cared about Maggie, that she was a cherished part of his 
life, that was and would remain in the past.  

Scott shook off the melancholy and continued. "It's the same  for 
you.  You're married to the FBI, and while you still love it, you 
need to let it go to move on with your life."

"Y'know, I don't know why everyone says you're so stupid," Tyrone 
said with respect.  "UFO's aside, you can actually make sense."

"Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't really matter.  But I'm doing  exactly 
what  I  want to do.  And the day it stops being fun,  I'm  outta 
here."

"Isn't that the arrogance of wealth speaking?" Tyrone asked.

"And  you're any different?  The 22 room Tudor shack you live  in 
is  not exactly my vision of poverty.  As I see it, it's  one  of 
the benefits," Scott said unembarrassed by his financial  securi-
ty.   "Before  I made my money, I swore that when I got  rich,  I 
would give something back.  You know, to the planet or society or 
something.    Do something useful and not for the  money."  Scott 
spoke  with  honest enthusiasm.  "But I don't believe  there's  a 
rule  that  says I have to be miserable.  I love what I  do,  and 
well,  I don't know.  The concept of career is different for  me.  
I  like  the  idea of doing a little bit of  everything  for  the 
experience.  You know, I drove a cab for one night.  Glad I  did, 
but never again."

"So?" asked Tyrone.

"So, do what you want to do and enjoy it. Period.  As a friend of 
a friend says, live long and prosper." 

Scott  let  Tyrone  sit in contemplative silence  as  the  waiter 
brought them two more.  They were doing a good job of sticking to 
the plan of getting 'shiffaced'.

"You  know,"  Tyrone opined,  "INTERNET is only the  tip  of  the 
iceberg. NASA is having ECCO and CERT look into over $12  Million 
in unaccounted-for telephone calls.   The Justice Department sold 
old  computers  containing  the names and other  details  of  the 
Witness  Protection  Program  to a junk dealer  in  Kentucky  and 
they're suing him to get them back.  The Secret Service is  rede-
signing its protection techniques for the President since someone 
got into their computers and copied the plans.  The computers  at 
Mitre  have been used by hackers for years to get  at  classified 
information.    The  public hears less than 1%  of  the  computer 
problems in the government.  And still, no one will do  anything.  
There's  even talk that the missing Plutonium that  the  Israelis 
theoretically stole in 1981 was actually a computer error."

"What do you want to do about it?"  Scott was asking as a friend, 
not a reporter.

"First," said a newly determined Tyrone,  "I'm gonna nail me some 
of  these  mothers, and I'll do it with your help.   Then,  after 
that?"  Tyrone's old smile was suddenly back.  "I think I'm gonna 
kick  myself some government ass."  Tyrone roared  with  laughter 
and  Scott joined the contagious behavior.  "In the  meantime,  I 
want  to  take  a look at some blackmail.  I  think  you  may  be 
right."

"About what?  I don't listen to what I tell you."

"Remember  you  said  that the  blackmail  scheme  wasn't  really  
blackmail."   Tyrone  shifted  his weight in  the  chair  and  he 
reached for the words through is fogged mind.  "You said it might 
be a way to make us too busy to see our own shadow.  That it  was 
a cover up for another dissociated crime."

"Yeah? It might be," Scott said.

Tyrone's body heaved while he snickered. "We finally have a lead.  
Demands have been made."

"What  kind? Who?  What do they want?"  Scott's  journalist  mind 
clicked into gear.  "What about the computer virus crap?"

"I'm kind of looking into both, but this morning my interest  was 
renewed.  A corporate type I met says not only he, but another 25 
or more of his corporate brethren are getting the same treatment.  
If he's right, someone is demanding over $30 Million in ransoms."

"Jesus Christ! Is that confirmed?"  Scott probed.

"Yes.  That's why I said you were right." 

The  implications were tremendous, even to Scott's clouded  mind.  
While  the  legal  system might not be  convinced  that  computer 
radiation  was  responsible  for an  obviously  well  coordinated 
criminal  venture,  he, as an engineer, realized  how  vulnerable 
anyone - everyone was.  The questions raced through his mind  all  
at once.  

Over  a  few dozen oysters and not as many drinks, Scott  and  Ty 
proceeded  to share their findings.  Scott had documents  up  the  
ying-yang, documents he couldn't use in a journalistic sense, but 
might  be valuable to the recent developments in Ty's  case.   He 
had moved the files to his home; they were simply taking too much 
space around his desk at the office.  They were an added  attrac-
tion  to the disaster he called his study.  Scott agreed to  show 
Ty  some  of them.  After the meeting with  Franklin  Dobbs,  and 
knowing there might be others in similar situations, Ty wanted an 
informal look at Scott's cache.  

"I've been holding back, Ty,"  Scott said during a lull in  their 
conversation.

"How do you mean?"

"I  got  a call from a guy I had spoken to a few  months  ago;  I 
assume  he sent me those files, and he said that  key  executives 
throughout the country were being blackmailed.  Some were borrow-
ing money from the mob to pay them off."

"Do you have names?  Who?"  Tyrone's took an immediate interest.

"Let  me  see if I have'm here," he said as he  reached  for  his 
small  notebook in the sports jacket draped over the back of  his 
chair.   "Yeah,  he  only gave me three, not much to  go  on.   A 
Faulkner,  some  banker  from L.A., a Wall  Street  tycoon  named 
Henson and another guy Dobbs, Franklin Dobbs."

"Dobbs!  How the hell do you know about Dobbs?" Tyrone yelled  so 
loud  several remaining bar patrons looked over  to see what  the 
ruckus was. 

Scott  was taken aback by the outburst.  "What're  you  hollering 
about?"

"Shit,  goddamned shit, I don't need this." Tyrone  finished  one 
and  ordered another drink.  He was keeping his promise; well  on 
the  way to getting severely intoxicated.  "Dobbs.  Dobbs is  the 
poor fucker that came into my office."

"You  saw  Dobbs?  He admitted it?"  Scott's heart raced  at  the 
prospect of a connection.  Finally.

"Scott," Tyrone asked quietly, "I have no right to ask you  this, 
but  I will anyway. If you find anything, on Dobbs, can you  hold 
back? Just for a while?"  A slight pleading on Tyrone's part.

"Why?"  Was this part of the unofficial trade with Ty for earlier 
information?

The  waiter  returned with the credit card.   Tyrone  signed  the 
slip,  giving the waiter entirely too much of a tip.  "I'll  tell 
you on the train.  Let's go."

"Where?"

"To your house.  You have a computer, don't you?"

"Yeah . . ."

"Well, let's see if we can find out who the other 25 are."

They took a cab from the Scarsdale station to Scott's house.   No 
point  in ending up in the clink for a DUI, even with  a  Federal 
Agent in tow.  Scott's study was in such disarray that he  liter-
ally  scraped off books and papers from the couch onto the  floor 
to  find Ty a place to sit and he piled up bigger piles of  files 
to make room for their beers on one of his desks.

Scott and Tyrone hadn't by any means sobered up on the train, but  
their thinking was still eminently clear.  During the hour  ride, 
they reviewed what they knew. 

Several  prominent businessmen were being  actively  blackmailed.  
In  addition,  the  blackmailer, or a  confederate,  was  feeding 
information  to the media.  At a minimum the Times, and  probably 
the Expos‚.  Perhaps other media as well were in receipt of simi-
lar information, but legitimate news organizations couldn't  have 
much to do with it in its current form.  

Presumably  then, like Scott, other reporters were calling  names 
in  the files.  Tyrone reasoned that such an exercise might be  a 
well planned maneuver on the part of the perpetrators.  

"Think  about it this way," he said.  "Let's say you get  a  call 
from  someone  who says they know something about  you  that  you 
don't want them to.  That'll shake you up pretty good, won't it?"  
Scott  rapidly agreed.  "Good.  And the nature of the contact  is 
threatening,  not directly, perhaps, but the undercurrent  leaves 
no doubt that the caller is not your best friend.  Follow?"

"And  then," Scott picked up, "a guy like me calls with the  same 
information.  The last person in the world he wants to know about 
his  activities is a reporter, or to see it show up in the  news, 
so he really freaks."

"Exactly!" Tyrone slapped his thigh.  "And, if he gets more  than 
one call, cardiac arrest is nearby. Imagine it.  Makes for a good 
case of justifiable paranoia."

Tyrone nodded vigorously.  "I've been in this game long enough to 
see the side effects  of blackmail and extortion.  The psycholog-
ical effects can be devastating.  An inherent distrust of strang-
ers  is common.  Exaggerated delusions occur in many cases.   But 
think  about this.  If we're right, you begin to distrust  every-
one, your closest friends, business associate, even your  family.  
Suddenly,  everyone is a suspect.  Distrust runs rampant and  you 
begin  to  feel a sense of isolation, aloneness.  It  feels  like 
you're  fighting  the entire world alone.  Solitude  can  be  the 
worst punishment."

The  analysis was sound.  The far ranging implications had  never 
occurred to Scott.  To him it had been a simple case of extortion 
or blackmail using some high tech wizardry.  Now, suddenly  there 
was a human element.  The personal pain that made the crime  even 
that much more sinister.

"Well, we, I mean the FBI, have seven stake outs.  It's a  fairly 
simple operation. Money drops in public places, wait and pick  up 
the  guy who picks up the money."  Tyrone made it sound so  easy.  
Scott wondered.

"I bet it isn't that simple," Scott challenged.

"No shit, it ain't,"  Tyrone came back.  

"So whaddya do?"

"Pay and have another beer."  Tyrone tempered the seriousness  of 
their conversation.  

As  Scott  got up to go the kitchen he called out, "Hey,  I  been 
thinking."

"Yeah?" Tyrone yelled. 

He  popped a Bud and handed it to Tyrone.  "Listen, I  know  this 
may be left field, but let's think it through."  Scott sat behind 
his  desk and put his feet on top of some books on the desk.   He 
leaned  back  and put  his hands behind his  head.   "We've  been 
talking about the front end of this thing, the front lines  where 
the  victims are actually being blackmailed.  The kind  of  stuff 
that makes headlines."  Scott smiled devilishly at Ty who made  a 
significant  hand  gesture in return.  "And  now  you're  talking 
about  how to catch them when they pick up the money.   Have  you 
thought of the other side?"

"What other side?"  Tyrone was still confused by Scott's logic.

"Assume  for a moment that all this information is really  coming 
from computers.  The CMR. Ok?"  Ty grudgingly shrugged his shoul-
ders.   "Ok, you said that there are 7 cases across the  country.  
Dobbs  said  he  knew of more here. Right?  Well,  who  gets  the 
information?"

Confusion showed on Tyrone's face. "Gets the information?"

"Yeah,  who runs around the country listening in  on  computers?" 
The question had been obvious to Scott.   All of sudden  Tyrone's 
face lit up.

"You mean the van?"

"Right.   How  many  vans would it take to  generate  all  this?"  
Scott pointed at  several boxes next to the disorganized shelves. 

"Damned if I know!"

"Neither do I, but I'll make a wild guess and say that there  are 
quite  a few running around.  One blew up, or more  specifically, 
was blown up.  You guys have the pieces."

"Not  any more," Ty said. "They were taken away by CI .  Said  it 
was  national security .  I was told to stay away from it.   Told 
you about us Feds."

"Whatever," Scott waved away the sidebar.  "The point is that  if 
a  whole bunch of these vans were used, that's not  cheap.   They 
held  a lot of very expensive equipment.   Why not look  for  the 
vans?   They  can't  be that hard to  find.   Maybe  you'll  find 
your . . . "

"Holy  Christ,  Mother Mary and Joseph, why didn't  I  think   of 
that."   Tyrone stood up and aimlessly meandered amongst  Scott's 
junk heaps.  "We've been looking in one direction only.  The  van 
ceased to exist in our minds since CI took it. The Government can 
be a royal pain in the ass.  The van, of course."

Just as Scott was going to describe how to find villains  without 
wasting  hundreds  of  hours scouring data  banks,  his  computer 
beeped  three times.  Scott was shaken from his  comfort.   "What 
the  .  .  .?"  He looked at the clock.  It  was  just  midnight.  
Kirk!  Kirk was calling and he totally had forgotten  to  mention 
the computer ransacking to Ty.

"Great!  It's Kirk. I wanted you to meet him."  As  Scott  leaned 
over  the keyboard to answer the page, Tyrone looked  quizzically 
at him. 

"Who's Kirk?"

"This hacker, some kid on the West Coast.  He's taught me a  lot.  
Good  guy.  Hope to meet him someday." Scott pushed a  few  keys. 
The screen came alive.

WTFO

"Hey," said Tyrone, "that's what we used to say in the Reserves."

Gotta Spook here.

SPOOK? YOU KNOW SPOOK?

Who's Spook?

YOU SAID HE'S WITH YOU

Not Spook, a spook.  FBI guy.

FBI?  YOU PROMISED.

Don't worry. Tell him yourself. Who is Spook, anyway?  

SPOOK IS A HACKER, ONE OF THE BEST.  BEEN ON THE SCENE FOR YEARS.  
A FEW PEOPLE CLAIM TO HAVE MET HIM, BUT IT'S ALWAYS A FRIEND OF A 
FRIEND OF A FRIEND. HE KEEPS A LOW PROFILE. THE WORD IS SPOOK  IS 
PLAYING SOME GOOD GAMES RECENTLY.  THE FBI?

He's a friend.  He doesn't know.

Tyrone  had come over to the crowded desk to watch the  exchange. 
"Who is this guy?  What don't I know?"

Kirk, can I tell him?  No one knows who you are?

I GUESS SO.  

Be back . . .

Scott  proceeded  to  tell Tyrone about the  warnings  that  Kirk 
received  and  then how his computers were destroyed.   That  the 
calling card warned Kirk to stay away from First State Bank.  And 
how  another  hacker  calling himself Da Vinci on  a  BBS  called 
Freedom might be a link.  Then Scott admitted that he had been in 
on  a  bank robbery, or at least breaking and entering  a  bank's 
computer.

Tyrone  had enough.  "I'm not sure I want to hear  anymore.   You 
have been busy.  So what can I do?"

"Tell Kirk what he can do," Scott said.

"He could probably go to jail.  Bank computers, my God!  Is  that 
where you get your stories? You live them and then report them in 
the third person? Stories for the inquiring mind."

"Are  you through! I mean, are you through?"  Scott sounded  per-
turbed.

"It's true. What does this guy want?" 

"Advice.  Talk to him.  Here."  Scott motioned for Tyrone to  sit 
at the keyboard.

"What do I do?"

"Just type," Scott said with exasperation.  "You're as bad as  my 
mother.  Type!" Scott ordered.

This is Ty

Scott  pulled  Ty's  hands from the keyboard. "A  handle,  use  a 
handle, like on a CB!"

"Oh, yeah, I forgot," Tyrone lied.

This is the FBI

Scott  looked on in shock. Tyrone laughed out loud.  "He  already 
knows who  I am. So what? I've always liked saying that anyway."  

KIRK HERE, FBI, WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE

So I hear. Been to any good banks lately?

REPO MAN, WHAT'S UP?

Can't take a joke?

YEAH.  NO PROBLEM.

Listen, I don't know you from Adam, and you don't have to talk to 
me, but I am curious.  Did your computers really get bashed?

TOTALLY, DUDE.

Tyrone pointed his thumb at the computer.  "Wise guy, eh?"

"Give him a chance.  Generation gap."  Tyrone didn't take  kindly 
to references to his age. Sensitive area.

Why?

CAUSE SOMEONE THINKS I KNOW SOMETHING THAT I DON'T

That's clear.

THANKS

Do you want to make a formal complaint?

WOULD IT DO ANY GOOD?

No.

THEN, NO

You think it was First State?

YES.

Don't you go around poking into other computers, too?

SURE

So why not someone else?

THEY DIDN'T GET INTO BIG TROUBLE FROM REPO MAN'S ARTICLE?

"He knows who you are?"  Tyrone asked.

"Sure.   He likes calling me Repo Man for some reason that  still 
escapes me.

Where else do you go?

THAT WOULD BE TELLING

Gotcha.  Well, I guess that's about it.

PHEW!

     <<<<<<CONNECTION	 TERMINATED>>>>>>

"I guess you scared him off." Scott was amused.

"Sorry," Tyrone said. 

"He'll call back," Scott waved off the apology.  "When the  coast 
is clear." 

"Fuck off."  Their friendship was returning to the level it  once 
had been.

"Hey, it's getting beyond late," Scott ignored him.  "What say we 
get together in a few days and sort through some of this."

"I  know, but one thing. Can you get into your computers, at  the 
paper?"

"Yeah, why?"

"Dobbs  said that the other victims had had their stock  go  down 
pretty  dramatically.  Can you look up stock prices and  perform-
ances over the last few months?"

"Yeah, do it all the time."

"Could you?  I want to see if there are any names I recognize."

"No  problem."  Scott dialed the Times' computer  and  identified 
himself.   After  going into the bank computer with  Kirk,  every 
time  he  dialed  up his office, he felt an  increased  sense  of 
power,  and an increased sense of responsibility.  He had  access 
to  massive amounts of information that if it got into the  wrong 
hands . . .

He shook the thought.  The computer offered the 'Stocks and Bonds 
Menu' and Scott set up a query in a modified SQL that was  simple 
enough for reporters to use: 

     ALL STOCKS LOSING 35% OR MORE OF VALUE IN LAST YEAR.

The  computer flashed a message. 'Working'.  Scott  leaned  back.  
"Takes  a  few seconds.  Oh, as I was saying, when  I  get  back,  
I'll call and we'll see what we can screw together."

"Back from where?"  Tyrone sounded accusatory but jealous.

"Europe.   Amsterdam." Scott checked the computer screen. It  was 
still busy.

"Rough life."  

"No,  it's only for a couple of days.  There's a hackers  confer-
ence.  I've been invited, by Kirk as a matter of fact."

"Hackers  conference, sounds like tons of fun."  Tyrone  was  not 
impressed.

"The best hackers in the world are going to be there.  I hope  to 
get  some leads on the First State mess.  The Freedom BBS is  not 
all it seems."

"Please stay in touch," Tyrone implored.

"Sure.   Here we go.  It's ready.  Ah, let's see, there  are  267 
companies who meet that criterion.  I guess that narrows it  down 
for you."

"Smart ass.  Ah, can you get those in New York only?"

"The city? Sure."

     SORT BY ZIP 100XX

"That'll give us . . ."

"I  know what it means."  Tyrone shut Scott up in  mock  defense.  
In  reality he didn't know much about computers, but some  things 
were obvious even to the technically naive.

"That was fast," said Scott. "Only 17. Help any?"

"Might. Can I get that on paper?"

Scott gave him the printout of the finances on the several unfor-
tunate  companies  who had lost more than a third  of  their  net 
worth in the last year.  Tyrone folded it into his jacket pocket.  
"Hey, call me a cab.  I'm too drunk to walk."

     Wednesday, December 30
     Lenox, Georgia

A  faded blue Ford Econoline van sat in the Lenox Square  parking 
lot.   The  affluent Atlanta suburb had been  targeted  from  the 
beginning.  Demographically ,it fit the bill to a tee.

From  the  outside, the van looked like a thousand  other  parked 
cars; empty, with their owners shopping in the huge mall.  On the 
inside  though, two men were intently operating a vast  array  of 
electronic equipment.

"Here  comes another one," said the first.  "How many  does  that 
make today?"

"A  hundred  and  forty seven.  Let's do  it."   The  second  man 
watched  the  enhanced color video image on a small  monitor.   A 
well  dressed  lady walked up to the ATM machine, card  in  hand.  
The  first man pressed a switch on another monitor and  the  snow 
filled  picture  was transformed into an electronic copy  of  the 
ATM's video display.

Please Insert Card

The screen in the van echoed the ATM screen.

"Can you tune it in a bit?" asked the first man. " It's a  little 
fuzzy."

"Yeah,  we must have settled.  Let me adjust the  antenna."   His 
hand  grabbed  a joystick on one of the tightly packed  racks  of 
equipment  and  gingerly moved it from left to right.   "Is  that 
better?"   A  small  disguised antenna on the  roof  of  the  van 
aligned itself as the joystick commanded. 

"Yeah . . .no . . .yeah, back again . . ."

"I see it. There."

"Thanks."

     Enter Personal Identification Number:

A  third monitor over the second man's cramped desk came to  life 
as the number 3435 appeared across his screen. 

"Got it.  You, too?"

"On disk and saved."

"I'll back it up."

"Better not.  Here comes another one."

"Busy day."

* * * * *

It was a very busy day.  Ahmed Shah saw to it that his  followers 
were kept busy, six days a week.  As they had been for months.

When  his army of a hundred plus Econoline vans were not  raiding 
the  contents  of  unsuspecting computers during  the  day,  they 
became  electronic  ears which listened in on  the  conversations 
between the ATM's and their bank customers.  

Ahmed's vans were used most efficiently.  On the road, doing  his 
bidding  twenty  four  hours a day, every day  but  the  Sabbath.  
Ahmed  created cells of eight loyal  anti-American  sympathizers, 
regardless of nationality, to operate with each van.  Each  group 
operated as an independent entity with only one person from  each 
able to communicate privately with Ahmed over cellular modem.  No 
cell knew of any other cell.  If one group was apprehended,  they 
couldn't tell what they didn't know.  Therefore, the rest of  the 
cells remain intact.

Absolute  loyalty was an unquestioned assumption for all  members 
of  Ahmed's  electronic  army.  It had to be that  way,  for  the 
bigger cause.  

All  day  and night one of Ahmed Shah's computers in his  lab  at 
Columbia  received constant calls from his cell leaders.   During 
the  day  it was the most interesting information that  they  had 
captured  from computer screens.  At night, it was the  passcodes 
to automatic bank tellers machines and credit card information.

Once  the  passcodes were in hand, making fake ATM  cards  was  a 
trivial task.

                    Chapter 18

     Wednesday, January 6
     Amsterdam, Holland

Scott  Mason  had a theory.  It didn't matter than  no  one  else 
believed it, or that they thought him daffy.  It worked for him.

He  believed that jet lag was caused by the human body  traveling 
across  mystical  magnetic force fields called  Ley  lines.   The 
physics  of his theory made common sense to anyone but  a  scien-
tist.   It  went like this: the body is  electric  and  therefore 
magnetic  fields can influence it.  Wherever we live we are  sub-
ject  to  the  local influence of magnetic,  electrical  and  Ley 
lines.  If we move too quickly, as by plane, through  Ley  lines, 
the  balance of our system is disturbed. The more Ley  lines  you 
traverse, the more upsetting it is to the system.  Thus, jet lag. 

But, Scott had a solution. Or more accurately, his mother had one 
which she had convinced him of years earlier. Scott carried  with 
him  a  small box, the size of a pack of cigarettes, that  had  a 
switch  and a blinking light.  It was called an  Earth  Resonance 
Generator,  or  ERG.  The literature said the ERG  established  a 
negative  gravity field through a magnetic Mobius  loop.   Inside 
the box was a battery, a loop of wire, a light emitting diode and 
the  back  side of the switch.  In short, nothing  of  electronic 
consequence  or obvious function. There was no way in  hell  that 
this  collection  of passive components could do  anything  other 
than wear out batteries.  All for $79.95 plus $4 shipping. 

Scott  first heard his mother proselytize about the magic of  the 
ERG  when he was ten or twelve.  His father, the role  model  for 
Archie  Bunker ignored her completely and said her  rantings  in-
creased  with  certain lunar phases.  Since his  father  wouldn't 
listen to her any longer, she endlessly lectured Scott about  the 
virtues of the ERG whenever she returned from a trip.  His father 
refused to travel, and had never even been on a plane.  

His mother so persisted in her belief that she even tried experi-
ments.  On  one  of her trips to Rome,  she  somehow  talked  the 
stewardesses  into  handing  out  the  400  questionnaires  she'd 
brought  with  her onto the plane.  It asked the  passengers  how 
they  felt after the flight, and if they do anything  special  to 
avoid  jet lag.  She claims more than 200 were returned and  that 
they  overwhelmingly indicated that no one felt jet lag  on  that 
trip.

She  attributed  this immense success to the  ERG  effects  which 
purportedly spread over one acre.  In other words, the ERG  takes 
care of an entire 747 or L-1011 or DC-10.

For years Scott successfully used the ERG to avoid jet lag.  Some 
people put brown paper bags in their shoes, others eat yogurt and 
bean  sprouts before a long flight.  Maybe his solution was  psy-
chosomatic, Scott admitted to anyone who asked, but, so what?  It 
still  works, doesn't it?  Scott was forever impressed that  air-
port security had never, once, asked him what this little  blink-
ing black box was.  Scary thought.

He arrived completely refreshed via KLM at the Amsterdam Interna-
tional  Airport  at 9:15 A.M.  While he had been to  Europe  many 
times,  he had thus far missed the Amsterdam experience.  He  had 
heard that pot was legal in Amsterdam.  In fact it was more  than 
legal.  Every morning the marijuana prices were broadcast on  the 
local  radio stations and Scott had every intention  of  sampling 
the  wares.   After 20 years of casual pot use, he  preferred  it 
immensely  to  the effects of drinking, and he was not  going  to 
miss out on the opportunity.

In  New  York no one harassed pot smokers,  but  technically,  it 
still  wasn't  legal, while Amsterdam  represented  the  ultimate 
counterculture.   This was the first time since Maggie  had  left 
for the Coast three years ago that Scott felt an independence,  a 
freedom reminiscent of his rebellious teen years. 

He gave the taxi driver the address of the Eureka! hotel, on  the 
Amstel.   During the half hour fifty guilder ride into  downtown, 
the  driver continuously chattered.  "Amsterdam has  more  canals 
than  Venice.  Many more.  Holland is mostly land reclaimed  from 
the  sea. We have the biggest system of dikes in  Europe.   Don't 
forget to see our diamond centers."  He spoke endlessly with deep 
pride about his native land. 

The  Eureka! is a small four story townhouse with only  16  rooms 
that  overlooked  the  Amstel, the largest  canal  in  Amsterdam, 
similar to the Grand Canal in Venice.    The Times had booked  it 
because  it was cheap, but Scott felt instantly at  home.   After 
settling  in, Scott called the local number that Kirk  had  given 
him.

"Hallo?"  A thick Dutch accent answered the phone.

"Hello?  I'm looking for Jon Gruptmann? This is Scott Mason."

"Ya, this is Jon."

"A mutual friend, Kirk, said I should call you."

"Ah, ya, ya.  Repo Man, is it not?"  The voice got friendly.

"That's what Kirk calls me."

"Ya,  ya.  He said you want to attend our meetings.  Ya? Is  that 
so?"   Jon sounded enthusiastic. 

"That's  why  I swam the Atlantic, all three thousand  miles.   I 
would love to!"  Jon didn't sound like Scott expected a  computer 
hacker to sound, whatever that was. 

"Huh?" Jon asked.  "Ah, ya, a joke.  Goot. Let me tell you  where 
we meet.  The place is small, so it may be very crowded.  I  hope 
you do not mind."  Jon sounded concerned about Scott's comfort. 

"Oh, no.  I'm used to inconvenience. I'm sure it will be fine."

"Ya,  ya.   I expect so.  The meetings don't really  begin  until 
tomorrow at 9AM.  Is that goot for you?"  

"Yes,  just fine, what's the address?" Scott asked as he  readied 
paper and pen.

"Ya.   Go to the warehouse on the corner of Oude  Zidjs  Voorburg 
Wal  and  Lange Niezel.  It's around from  the  Oude  Kerksplein.  
Number 44."

"Hold it, I'm writing." Scott scribbled the address phonetically.  
A necessary trick reporters use when someone is speaking unintel-
ligibly.  "And then what?"

"Just say you're Repo Man.  There's a list.  And please remember, 
we don't use our given names."

"No problem. Fine.  Thank you."

"Ya. What do you plan for tonight?" Jon asked happily.

"I hadn't really thought about it," Scott lied. 

"Ya, ya.  Well, I think you should see our city. Enjoy the unique 
pleasures Amsterdam has to offer."  

"I might take a walk . . . or something."

"Ya,  ya, or something. I understand.  I will see  you  tomorrow.  
Ya?"  Jon said laughing.

"Wouldn't miss it for the world."

"Do  one favor?"  Jon asked.  "Watch your wallet.  We  have  many 
pickpockets."

"Thanks for the warning.  See you tomorrow."  Click. I grew up in 
New York, Scott thought.  Pickpockets, big deal.

* * * * *

Scott  took  a shower to remove the vestiges of the  eleven  hour 
trip; an hour ride to Kennedy, an hour and a half at the airport, 
a half hour on the tarmac, seven hours on the plane, and an  hour 
getting into town.   

He dressed casually in the American's travel uniform: jeans, jean 
jacket  and warm sweater.  He laced his new Reeboks knowing  that  
Amsterdam  is  a  walking city. Driving would  be  pure  insanity 
unless  the goal is sitting in two hour traffic jams. The  single 
lane  streets straddle the miles of canals throughout  the  inner 
city  which is arranged in a large semi-circular pattern.   Down-
town, or old Amsterdam, is a dense collection of charming  clean, 
almost pristine 4 story buildings built over a period of  several 
hundred  years.  That's the word for Amsterdam;  charming.   From 
late medieval religious structures to townhouses that are tightly 
packed  on almost every street, to the various Pleins  where  the 
young crowds congregate in the evenings, Amsterdam has  something 
for  everyone.  Anne Frank's house to the Rembrandt Museum  to  a 
glass  roofed boat trip down the canals through the diamond  dis-
trict and out into the Zeider Zee.  Not to mention those  attrac-
tions for the more prurient.

He  ran  down the two flights to the hotel lobby  and  found  the 
concierge behind the Heineken bar which doubled as a registration 
desk.  He wanted to know where to buy some pot.

"Not to find us selling that here," the Pakistani concierge  said 
in broken English.  

"I  know.  But where . . ."  It was an odd feeling to  ask  which 
store sold drugs.

"You want Coffee Shop," he helpfully said.

"Coffee Shop?"  Scott asked, skeptical of the translation.

"Across bridge, make right, make left."  The concierge  liberally 
used his hands to describe the route. "Coffee shop.  Very good."  

Scott  thanked him profusely and made a quick exit thinking  that 
in  parts of the U.S., Texas came to mind,  such  a  conversation 
could  be construed as conspiracy.  He headed out into  the  cool 
damp late morning weather.  The air was crisp, clean, a  pleasure 
to  breathe  deeply.   The Amstel canal, not  a  ripple  present, 
echoed the tranquility that one feels when walking throughout the 
city.  There are only a half dozen or so 'main' streets or boule-
vards in Amsterdam and they provide the familiar intense interna-
tional  commercialism  found in any major European city.   It  is 
when one begins to explore the back streets, the countless alleys 
and  small  passageways; the darkened corridors  that  provide  a 
short  cut to the bridge to the next islet; it is then  that  one 
feels the essence of Amsterdam.

Scott  crossed  over the bridge that spans the wide  Amstel  con-
scious  of the small high speed car and scooters that dart  about 
the tiny streets. He turned right as instructed and looked at the 
street  names on the left.  While Scott spoke reasonable  French, 
Dutch escaped him.  Bakkerstraat.  Was that the name? It was just 
an  alley,  but there a few feet down on the right  was  the  JPL 
Coffee  Shop.  JPL was the only retail establishment  on  Bakker-
straat,  and it was unassuming, some might call it  derelict,  in 
appearance.  From a distance greater than 10 meters, it  appeared 
deserted. 

Through the large dirty plate glass window Scott saw a handful of 
patrons  lazing on white wrought iron cafe chairs at small  round 
tables.   The  Coffee Shop was no larger than  a  small  bedroom.  
Here goes nothing, Scott thought as he opened the door to  enter.  
No one paid scant attention to him as he crossed over and  leaned 
on the edge of the bar which was reminiscent of a soda  fountain.  
A man in his young twenties came over and amiably introduced him-
self  as Chris, the proprietor of the establishment. How could he 
be of service?

"Ah . . . I heard I can buy marijuana here," Scott said.  

"Ya, of course. What do you want?" Chris asked.  

"Well,  just  enough for a couple of days, I can't take  it  back 
with me you know," Scott laughed nervously. 

"Ya.  We also have cocaine, and if you need it, I can get you he-
roin."  Chris  gave  the sales pitches verbally -  there  was  no 
printed menu in this Coffee Shop.

"No!"  Scott  shot back immediately, until he realized  that  all 
drugs  were legal here, not just pot.  He didn't want to  offend.  
"Thanks anyway.  Just some grass will do."

"How many grams do you want?"

Grams?  How  many grams? Scott mused that  the  metric  Europeans 
thought in grams and Americans still in ounces and pounds.  O.K., 
28 grams to an ounce . . .

"Two  grams," Scott said.  "By the way, how late are  you  open?"  
Scott pushed his rounded spectacles back up his nose.  

"Ah, sometimes 8, sometimes 10, sometimes late," Chris said while 
bringing  a tissue box sized lock box to the top of the bar.   He 
opened  it  and inside were several bags of pot and  a  block  of 
aluminum foil the size of a candy bar. "You want hashish?"  Chris 
offered.

Scott  shook his head, 'no,' so Chris opened one of the bags  in-
stead of the candy bar.

"You  American?"   A  voice came from one of  the  tables.  Scott 
looked  around.  "Here," the voice said.  "Me too."  The man  got 
up  and approached Scott.  "Listen, they got two types  of  ganja 
here. Debilitating and Coma.  I've made the mistake."

"Ya, we have two kinds," Chris agreed laughing.  "This will  only 
get you a little high," he said holding up a bag.  "This one," he 
held up another, "will get you stoned."

"Bullshit,"  the American said.  "Their idea of a little high  is 
catatonic  for  us.  Take my word for it.  The  Mexican  shit  we 
smoke?  They'd give it to the dogs."

"You  sold  me," Scott said holding his hands  up  in  surrender.  
"Just  a little high is fine by me.  Two grams, please," he  said 
to Chris pointing at the less potent bag.  "Thanks for the  warn-
ing," he said to the American.  "Where you from?"  Scott asked.

"Oh, around.  I guess you could call Washington my home."

"D.C.?"

"Yeah," the American nodded.  "And you?"  He leaned over the back 
of his chair to face Scott.

"Big Apple.  The 'burbs."

"What brings you here?"

"To Europe?" Scott asked.

"Amsterdam.  Sin City.  Diamonds?"

"No, I wish," Scott laughed.  "News. A story brought me here  for 
a couple of days."

Chris  finished weighing Scott's purchase on a sensitive  digital 
scale that measured the goods down to the nearest hundredth of  a 
gram.   Scott handed Chris $10 in Guilders and pocketed the  pot.  
"Um,  where can I get some papers?"  Scott asked.  Chris  pointed 
to  a  glass  on the bar with a complete  selection  of  assorted 
paraphernalia.

"Hey, why don't you join me," the American asked.  "I've been  to 
Amsterdam before."

"Is it all right to smoke in here?" Scott asked looking around.

"Sure,  that's what coffee shops are.  The only other  thing  you 
can buy in here is sodas.  No booze."  The American spoke  confi-
dently as he lit up a joint and passed it to Scott.

"Thanks," Scott coughed as he handed it back.  "Oh, I don't think 
I caught your name.

"Oh, just call me Spook."

THE Spook? thought Scott.  What incredible synchronicity.

Scott's body instantly tensed up and he felt the adrenaline  rush 
with  an associated rise in pulse rate. Was this really the  leg-
endary Spook?

Is it possible that he fell into a chance meeting with the hacker 
that  Kirk  and  his friends refer to as  the  king  of  hackers?  
Spook?  Gotta stay cool.  Could he be that lucky?  Was there more 
than  one spook?   Scott momentarily daydreamed, remembering  how 
fifteen years before, in Athens, Greece he had opened a taxi door 
right into the face a lady who turned out to be an ex-high-school 
girl friend.  It is a small world, Scott thought tritely.

"Spook?   Are you a spy?" Scott comically asked, careful to  dis-
guise his real interest.

"If  I answer that I'll have to kill you," the Spook laughed  out 
loud  in  the  quiet establishment. "Spy?  Hardly.  It's  just  a 
handle."  Spook said guardedly.  "What's yours?"

"Mine?  Oh,  my handle.  They call me Repo Man, but  it's  really 
Scott Mason. Glad to meet you.  Spook," he added handing back the 
intoxicating cigarette.

BINGO!  Scott Mason in hand without even a search.  Landing right 
in  his lap.  Keep your cool.  Dead pan poker face.   What  unbe-
lievable luck.  Don't blow it, let's play this for all that  it's 
worth.   Your life just got very simple.  Give both Homosoto  and 
Mason exactly what they want with no output of energy.

"You  said you're a reporter," Spook said inhaling deeply  again.  
"What's the story?"  At least he gets high, Spook thought.  Mason 
could  have been a real dip-shit nerd.  Thank God for  small  fa-
vors.

"There's  a hacker conference that I was invited to," Scott  said 
unabashedly.  "I'm trying to show the hacker's side of the story.  
Why they do what they do.  How they legitimize it to themselves." 
Scott's  mouth was rapidly drying out so he ordered a Pepsi.   "I 
assume you're a hacker, too," Scott broached the issue carefully.

Spook smiled widely. "Yup.  And proud of it."

"You don't care who knows?" Scott asked looking around to see  if 
anyone  was paying attention to their conversation.  Instead  the 
other  patrons were engrossed in chess or  huddled  conversation.  
Only Chris, the proprietor listened from behind the bar. 

"The  Spook  is all anyone knows. I like to keep  it  that  way," 
Spook said as he laid the roach end of the joint in the  ashtray.  
"Not bad, huh?" He asked Scott.

"Christ, no.  Kinda hits you between the eyes." Scott rubbed them 
to clear off the invading fog.

"After  a  couple of days it won't get you so bad,"  Spook  said.  
"You said you wanted to do a fair story on hackers, right?"

"Fair?   A fair story? I can only try.  If hackers act  and  talk 
like  assholes then they'll come across like assholes, no  matter 
what I do.  However, if they make a decent case, hold a rational, 
albeit arguable position, then maybe someone may listen."   

"You sound like you don't approve of our activities."  The  Spook 
grinned devilishly.  

"Honestly,  and I shouldn't say this cause this is  your  grass,"  
Scott said lighting the joint again.  "No, I don't approve, but I 
figure there's at least 10 sides to a story, and I'm here to find 
that story and present all sides.  Hopefully I can even line up a 
debate  or two.  Convincing me is not the point; my readers  make 
up their own minds."

The word 'readers' momentarily jolted the Spook until he realized 
Scott meant newspaper readers, not his team of Van-Ecking  eaves-
droppers.  Spook took the joint from Scott. "You sound  like  you 
don't want to approve."

"Having  a hard time with all the crap going down with  computers 
these days," Scott agreed.  "I guess my attitude comes through in 
my articles."

"I've never read your stuff," Spook lied.

"Mainly in New York."

"That explains it.  Ever been to Amsterdam?"

"No, I was going to get a map and truck around . . ."

"How  about I show you around, and try to convince you about  the 
honor of our profession?"  Spook asked.

"Great!"  Scott agreed. "But what about . . ."  He made a  motion 
to his lips as if he was holding a cigarette.

"Legal on the streets."

"You sure?"

"C'mon,"  Spook  said  rising from his  chair.  "Chris,  see  you 
later," he promised.  Chris reciprocated and invited his two  new 
friends to return any time. 

Scott followed Spook up the alley named Bakkerstraat and into the 
Rembrandt Plein, a huge open square with cafes and street  people 
and hotels.  "At night," Spook said, "Rembrandt and another 4  or 
5  pleins are the social hub of activity for the younger  genera-
tion.   Wished  I had had this when I was a kid.   How  are  your 
legs?"   The  Spook amorously ogled the throngs  of  young  women 
twenty years his junior.

"Fine, why?"

"I'm going to show you Amsterdam."

Scott and the Spook began walking. The Spook knew his way  around 
and  described much of the history and heritage of the city,  the 
country  and its culture.  This kind of educated hacker  was  not 
what  Scott  had expected.  He had thought that  today's  hackers 
were nerds, the propeller heads of his day, but he was  discover-
ing through the Spook, that he may have been wrong.  Scott remem-
bered  Clifford Stoll's Hanover Hacker was a well positioned  and 
seemingly  upstanding individual who was selling stolen  computer 
information  to the KGB.  How many nerds would have the  gumption 
to play in that league?

They  walked to the outer edge of Old Amsterdam, on  the  Singel-
gracht  at  the Leidseplein.  Without a map or the  Spook,  Scott 
would have been totally lost.  The streets and canals were all so 
similar that, as the old phrase goes, you can't tell the  players 
without a scorecard.   Scott followed the Spook onto an  electric 
street  car.   It headed down the Leidsestraat, one  of  the  few 
heavily commercial streets and across the Amstel again.

The  street car proceeded up the Nieuwezuds Voorburgwal,  a  wide 
boulevard  with  masses of activities on both  sides.   This  was 
tourist madness, thought Scott.  

"This is freedom," said the Spook.

"Freedom?"  The word instantly conjured his memory of the Freedom 
League,  the BBS he suspected was up to no-good.   The Spook  and 
Freedom?

"At  the end of this street is the Train Station.   Thousands  of 
people come through this plaza every day to experience Amsterdam.  
Get  whatever it is out of their system.  The drugs,  the  women, 
the  anarchy of a country that relies upon the integrity  of  its 
population  to  work. Can't you feel it?"  The  Spook  positively 
glowed as he basked in the aura of the city.

Scott had indeed felt it during their several hours together.  An 
intense  sense  of independence that came from  a  generation  of 
democratic  socialism.   Government regulated  drugs,  a  welfare 
system  that  permitted the idle to live nearly as  well  as  the 
working.   Class structures blurred by taxes  so  extraordinarily 
high  that  most everyone lived in similarly  comfortable  condi-
tions.  Poverty is almost non-existent.  

Yet, as the Spook explained to Scott, "This is not the world  for 
an entrepreneur.  That distinction still belongs to the ol'  Red, 
White  and Blue.  It's almost impossible to make any  real  money 
here."

The sun was setting behind the western part of the city, over the 
church steeples and endless rows of townhouses.

"Hungry yet?" Spook grinned at Scott.

"Hungry?   I got a case of the munchies that won't  quit.   Let's 
eat."  Scott's taste buds were entering panic mode. 

"Good,"  the Spook said as he lit up another joint on the  street 
car.  "Let's eat."  He hastily leapt off the slow moving vehicle.  
Scott  followed him across the boulevard and dodged cars,  busses 
and  bicycles.  They stopped in front of a small Indonesian  res-
taurant, Sarang Mas, ably disguised with a red and white  striped 
awning and darkened windows.  

"Ever had Indonesian food?"

"No, well maybe, in New York I guess . . ."

Miles dragged Scott into the unassuming restaurant and the  calm-
ing  strains  of Eastern music replaced the city  noises  on  the 
street  outside. The red and white plastic checkered  tablecloths 
severely  clashed with the gilt of the pagoda shaped  decorations 
throughout.  But only by American tastes.  Sarang Mas was a  much 
touted and reputable restaurant with very fine native  Indonesian 
chefs doing the preparations.

"Let  me tell you something," the Spook said.  "This food is  the 
absolute  finest  food available, anywhere in the world,  bar  no 
idyllic island location, better than a trip to Hershey,  Pennsyl-
vania to cure a case of the munchies.  It's delicate, it's sweet, 
it's  taste bud heaven, it's a thousand points of  flavor  you've 
never tried before."  The Spook sounded like a hawker on the Home 
Shopping Network.

"Shut up," Scott joked.  "You're just making it worse."

"Think  of  the oral orgasm that's coming.   Anticipation."   The 
waiter had appeared and waited patiently.  It was still early and 
the  first seating crowd was two hours away.  "Do you mind  if  I 
order?"  

"No,  be  my guest.  Just make it fast food.  Super  fast  food," 
Scott begged.

"Ah, let's have a couple of Sate Kambings to start, ah, and we'll 
share some Daguig Goreng, and some Kodok Goreng and ah, the Guila 
Kambing.   And," Spook looked at Scott, "a couple of  Heinekens?"  
Scott nodded.  "And, if there's any way you could put that  order 
into  warp  drive, my friend here," he pointed at  Scott,  "would 
appreciate it muchly."  

"Very  good,"  the dark skinned Indonesian waiter replied  as  he 
scurried back to the kitchen.  

It  still took half an hour for the appetizers to arrive.   Scott 
chewed  up  three straws and tore two napkins into  shreds  while 
waiting.  

"What is this," asked Scott as he voraciously dove into the food.

"Does it matter?"

"No,"  Scott bit into it.  "Mmmmmmm . . .Holy shit, that's  good, 
what is it?"

"Goat parts," the Spook said with a straight face.

Scott  stopped  chewing. "Which goat parts?" he  mumbled  staring 
over the top of his round glasses. 

"The good parts," said the Spook taking two big bites.  "Only the 
good parts."

"It's nothing like, eyeballs, or lips or . . ."  Scott was gross-
ing himself out. 

"No, no, paysan, eat up.  It's safe."  The Spook made the Italian 
gesture  for eating.  "Most of the time."  The Spook chuckled  as 
he ravaged the unidentifiable goat parts on his plate.  

Scott looked suspiciously at the Spook, who seemed to be  surviv-
ing.  How bad could it be?  It tasted great, phenomenal, but what 
is it? Fuck it.  Scott wolfed down his goat parts in total ecsta-
sy.  The Spook was right.  This was the best tasting food he  had 
had, ever.

The rest of the meal was as sensorally exquisite as the  appetiz-
er.   Scott felt relieved once the waiter had promised  that  the 
goat  parts  were from a goat roast, just like a rib roast  or  a 
pork roast.  Nothing disgusting like ear lobes. Ecch!

"So  you  want to know why we do it," said the Spook  in  between 
nibbles  of  Indonesian frog legs.  Scott had to  think  hard  to 
realize that the Spook had shifted the conversation to hacking.

"It had occurred to me," responded Scott.  "Why do you do it?"

"I've  always  liked  biology,  so  hacking  became  the  obvious 
choice,"  Spook said laughing.  Scott looked perplexed  but  that 
didn't interrupt his voracious attack on the indescribably  deli-
cious foods on his plate.

"How old are you?" Asked the Spook.

"The Big four-oh is in range."

"Good, me too. Remember Marshall McCluhan?"

"The medium is the message guru."  Scott had admired him and made 
considerable  effort  to attend a few of  his  highly  motivating 
lectures. 

"Exactly.  He predicted it 20 years early.  The Networked  Socie-
ty."  The  Spook paused to toss more food into his  mouth.   "How 
much do you know about computers?"

"I'm  learning," Scott said modestly.  Whenever asked that  ques-
tion he assumed that he was truly ignorant on the subject despite 
his  engineering  degree.  It was just that computers  had  never 
held the fascination for him that they did for others.

"O.K.,  let me give you the low down." The Spook sucked down  the 
last of the Heineken and motioned to the waiter for two more.  He 
wiped  his  lips and placed his napkin beside  the  well  cleaned 
plate.   "At what point does something become alive?"

"Alive?" Scott mused.  "When some carbon based molecules get  the 
right combination of gases in the proper proportions of  tempera-
ture and pressure . . ."

"C'mon,  guy.  Use your imagination," the Spook scoffed with  his 
eyes twinkling.  "Biologically, you're right, but philosophically 
that's  pretty  fucking  lame. Bart Simpson could  come  up  with 
better  than  that."  The Spook could be most  insulting  without 
even trying.  "Let me ask you, is the traffic light system in New 
York alive?"  

"No  way!" Retorted Scott.  "It's dead as a doornail,  programmed 
for  grid  lock."   They both laughed at the  ironic  choice  for 
analogy.

"Seriously,  in many ways it can be considered alive," the  Spook 
said.   "It  uses  electricity as its source of  power  or  food.  
Therefore it eats, has a digestive system and has waste  product; 
heat.  Agreed?"

Scott nodded.  That was a familiar personification for  engineer-
ing students.

"And, if you turn off the power, it stops functioning.  A  tempo-
rary starvation if you will.  It interacts with its  environment; 
in  this case with sensors and switches that react to the  condi-
tions at any particular moment.  And lastly, and most  important-
ly,  it  has purpose."  Scott raised  his  eyebrows  skeptically.  
"The program, the rules, those are its purpose.  It is coinciden-
tally the same purpose that its designers had, but nonetheless it 
has purpose."

"That doesn't make it alive. It can't think, as we do, and  there 
is no ego or personality," Scott said smugly.

"So  what?   Since when does plankton or slime mold  join  Mensa?  
That's sentience."  Spook walked right over Scott's comment.

"O.K.,"  Scott acquiesced.  "I'm here to play  Devil's  Advocate, 
not make a continent of enemies."

"Listen,  you better learn something early on," Spook  leaned  in 
over the table.  His seriousness caught Scott's attention.   "You 
can  disagree  with us all you want, that's not a  problem,  most 
everyone does.  But, we do expect fairness, personal and  profes-
sional."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning,"  the dimples in Spook's smiling cheeks radiated  cama-
raderie.   "Don't give up on an argument so early if you  believe 
in it.  That's a chicken shit way out of taking a position.  Real 
kindergarten."  The Spook finished off his Heineken in two gulps.

Scott's tension eased realizing the Spook wanted the debate,  the 
confrontation.   This  week could be a lot more fun than  he  had 
thought.

"At any rate, can you buy into that, that the traffic systems are 
alive?" The Spook asked again.

"I'll hold my final judgment in abeyance, but for sake of discus-
sion, let's continue," acquiesced Scott.

"Fair enough.  In 1947, I think that was the year, some guy  said 
that  he doubted there would be world wide market for  more  than 
three computers."

Scott choked on his beer.  "Three?  Ha! What mental moron came up 
with that?"

"Watson.   Thomas  Watson, founder of IBM," the Spook  said  dead 
pan.

"You're kidding."

"And what about Phil Estridge?"

"Who's that?"

"Another  IBM'er," said the Spook.  "He was kind of  a  renegade, 
worked outside of the mainstream corporate IBM mold.  His  bosses 
told  him,  'hey, we need a small cheap computer to  tie  to  our 
bigger computers.  This little company Apple is selling too  many 
for  us not to get involved.  By the way, Corporate  Headquarters 
thinks  this  project  is a total waste of  money;  they've  been 
against  it from the outset.  So, you have 8 months.'  They  gave 
him  8  months to build a computer that would set  standards  for 
generations of machines.  And, he pulled it off.  Damned shame he 
died. 

"So,  here  we have IBM miss-call two of the greatest  events  in 
their history yet they still found ways to earn tens of  billions 
of dollars.  Today we have, oh, around a hundred million  comput-
ers  in  the world.  That's a shitload of computers.   And  we're 
cranking out twelve million more each year.  

"Then we tied over fifty million of these computers together.  We 
used  local  area networks, wide area networks,  dedicated  phone 
lines,  gate  ways, transmission backbones all in  an  effort  to 
allow  more and more computers to talk to each other.   With  the 
phone company as the fabric of the interconnection of our comput-
ers we have truly become a networked society.  Satellites further 
tighten  the weave on the fabric of the Network.   With  a  modem 
and telephone you have the world at your fingertips."  The  Spook 
raised his voice during his passionate monologue. 

"Now  we can use computers in our cars or boats and use  cellular 
phone  links  to create absolute networkability.  In  essence  we 
have  a  new life form to deal with, the world  wide  information 
Network."

"Here's  where we definitely diverge," objected Scott,  hands  in 
the air.  "Arriving at the conclusion that a computer network  is 
a  life form, requires a giant leap of faith that I have  trouble 
with."

"Not  faith, just understanding," the Spook said  with  sustained 
vigor.   "We can compare networks to the veins and blood  vessels 
in  our bodies.  The heart pumps the blood, the  lungs  replenish 
it,  the  other organs feed off of it.  The veins  serve  as  the 
thoroughfares  for blood just as networks serve as  highways  for 
information.   However, the Network is not static, where a  fixed 
road  map describes its operation.  The Network is in a  constant 
state of flux, in all likelihood never to repeat the same pattern 
of connections again.  

"So you admit," accused Scott, "that a network is just a conduit, 
one made of copper and silicon just as the vein in a conduit?"

"Yes, a smart conduit," the Spook insisted.   "Some conduits  are 
much  smarter than others.  The Network itself is a set of  rules 
by  which information is transmitted over a conductive  material.  
You can't touch a network.  Sure, you can touch the computer, the 
network wire, you can touch the bits and pieces that make up  the 
Network, but you cannot touch the Network.  The Network exists as 
a synergistic byproduct of many dissimilar and physically isolat-
ed devices."

"I must admit Spook . . ."

"That's Mister Spook to you earth man," joked the Spook.  "Sorry, 
continue."

"I  could probably nickel and dime you into death by  boredom  on 
several  points,  but I will concede that they are  arguable  and 
better  relegated for a long evening of total disagreement.   For 
the sake of world peace I will not press the issue now."

"How very kind," mocked the Spook.  "Let's get out of here,  take 
a walk, and I'll continue your education."

If  anyone  else spoke to Scott so derogatorily, there  would  be 
instant  conflict.  The Spook, though, didn't raise  the  defense 
mechanism  in  Scott.  Spook was actually a  likable  fellow,  if 
somewhat arrogant.

They walked back down Nieuwezuds Voorburgwal and Beursplein  very 
slowly.  The Spook lit up another joint.  

"What's this," said Scott appreciatively, "an endless supply?"

"When in Rome!" replied Spook.  The brightly lit grand  boulevard 
was  a  sample of the energy that permeates the  Amsterdam  night 
life.   The  train  station was still a hub of  activity  in  the 
winter darkness of early evening. 

"So  look at the Network.  You can cut off its tentacles,  that's 
better  than legs and feet in this case, and they will  reappear, 
reconnect  somewhere  else.  Alternate routing  bypasses  trouble 
spots,  self diagnostics help the Network doctors,  priority  and 
preferences  are  handled  according to a clear  set  of  rules."  
Spook waved his hands to reinforce his case. 

"That's, ah, quite, ah, a theory.  What do the experts say  about 
this?"  Scott was teetering on the edge of partial acceptance.

"Experts?   We're  the experts.  That's why we  hack,  don't  you 
see?"   The answer was so obvious it didn't deserve  a  question.  
"Now,  I can only speak for myself, but I find that  the  Network 
organism itself is what's interesting.  The network, the  sponta-
neously grown information organism that covers most of the planet 
Earth.  I believe that is why all hackers start hacking.   Innate 
curiosity about the way things work.  Then, before our eyes,  and 
behind the back of the world, the planet gets connected,  totally 
connected  to each other, and we haven't examined  the  ramifica-
tions  of that closeness, computer-wise that is. That's  what  we 
do."  The Spook sounded satisfied with his explanation.  

Scott thought about it as they crossed Kerksplein and over canals 
to  the Oude Zijds Voorbugwal.  Was the Spook spouting off a  lot 
of rationalized bullshit or were he and the likes of him actually 
performing  valuable services, acting as  technological  sociolo-
gists  to five billion clients?  If a network was alive,  thought 
Scott, it was alive in the sense that a town or village is alive, 
as the sum of its parts.  As a society is alive.  If the computer 
terminal and its operator are members of a global village, as are 
thousands of other computer users, might that not be considered a 
society?   Communications are indeed different, but Scott  remem-
bered that Flatland was considered a valid society with a  unique 
perspective on the universe.  Is it any different than the  tele-
phone,  which connects everyone on the planet?  Shit, Spook  made 
some sense.

They paused on a bridge by the Voorsbugwal, and a few blocks down 
the  canal Scott saw a concentration of bright  lights.   "What's 
that?" He asked.

"Poontang," the Spook said lasciviously.

"Say wha?" Scott asked 

"This  is  Horny Heaven, Ode to Orgasm, Pick a  Perversion."  The 
Spook proudly held his arms out.  

"Aha, the Red Light District," Scott added dryly.

"Don't  take the romance out of it, this is sleaze at it's  best.  
Believe  me I know."  Somehow Scott had no doubts.  With the  way 
Spook was passionately describing the specific acts and  services 
available  within the 10 square block hotbed of sex,  Scott  knew 
that the Spook was no novice.  They grabbed a couple of Heinekens 
from a bar and slowly strolled down one side of the carnal canal. 

"I was going to go to the Yab Yub tonight, but since you've never 
been here before, I figured I owed you a tour."

"Yab Yub?  Am I supposed to know . . ."

"The biggest bestest baddest whorehouse in Amsterdam," said Spook 
exuberantly. 

"O.K., fine, and this is . . ."

"The slums."

"Thanks a lot," Scott said sarcastically.  

"No,  this  is for middle class tourist sex.  Yab  Yub  is  first 
class but this'll do me just fine.  How about you? Ready for some 
serious debauching?" The Spook queried.

"Huh?"   Scott laughed anxiously. "Oh, I don't know,  I've  never 
been terribly fond of hookers." 

"First time when I was 13.  My uncle took me to a whorehouse  for 
my  birthday.   Shit," the Spook fondly grinned  at  the  memory. 
"I'll  never forget the look on my mom's face when he  told  her.  
She lectured him for a week.  Christ," he paused. "It's so funny, 
you know.  My uncle's gay."  

Scott was enjoying the conversation and the company of the Spook.  
Americans meeting up with kindred Americans in a foreign land  is 
a breath of fresh air and the Spook provided that. 

Scott  window shopped as they walked, sidestepping the  very  few 
venturesome cars which attempted to penetrate the horny  humanity 
on the crowded cobblestone streets.  The variety of sexual  mate-
rials was beyond comprehension.  Spook seemed to be avidly fluent 
in  their description and application.  In one window,  a  spiked 
dildo  of emmense girth and length dominated the display.   Scott 
grimaced at the weapon while the Spook commented on it's possible 
uses at an adult sit'n'spin party.

"Here's  the live sex show," the Spook said invitingly.   "Pretty 
wild.  Look at the pictures."  Scott leaned over to view a set of 
graphic  photographs that would have caused the Meese  Commission 
on Pornography to double dose on its Geritol.

"Damn,  they show this stuff on the street, huh?" Asked the  sur-
prised Scott.  He wasn't naive, it was just quite a shock to  see 
such  graphic  sexuality in such a concentration and in  such  an 
open  manner.  On Sundays when the Red Light District  is  closed 
until 6 P.M., many Dutch families use the window dressings as the 
textbook  for their children's' sex education.  "No,  let's  keep 
going," Scott said unconvinced he would partake of the pleasures.

"Isn't  this great?"  The Spook blurted out as Scott was  looking 
in the window of one of the hundred plus sex shops.  "I just love 
it.  Remember I was telling you about freedom in Amsterdam?  It's 
kind of like the hacker's ethic."

Spook  was going to equate sex and hacking?  "Is that 'cause  all 
hacker's are hard up?" Scott laughed.

"No, dig it."  The Spook suddenly stopped to face Scott.   "Free-
dom, total freedom implies and requires responsibility.   Without 
that, the system would collapse into chaotic anarchy.  Hacking is 
a  manifestation of freedom.  Once we have cracked a system,  and 
are in it, we have the freedom to do anything we want.  But  that 
freedom  brings  responsibility too, and, just like with  sex  so 
freely available, legally, it must be handled with care."   Spook 
was  sermonizing again, but was making more sense. His  parallels 
were concise and poignant.  

They walked further into the heart of the District and the  Spook 
was constantly distracted by the quantity of red lights over  the 
basement  and first floor windows.  He wanted to closely  examine 
the contents of every one.  In each window was a girl,  sometimes 
two, clad in either a dental floss bathing suit or a see  through 
penoire. Scott enjoyed the views, but thought that the Spook  was 
acting  somewhat obsessively. The calm, professional,  knowledge-
able hacker had reverted into a base creature, driven by hormonal 
compulsion. Or then again, maybe they were just stoned.

"I gotta pick the right one, just the right one," the Spook said.  
"Let's  see what else is available.  Got to find you a good  one, 
too."

Scott shook his head.  "I don't know . . ."

"What,  you don't wanna get laid?  What's the matter  with  you?" 
The Spook couldn't believe his ears.

The  sheer intensity of the omnipresent sexual  stimulation  gave 
Scott  the  urge to pause and ask himself why.   The  desire  was 
physically manifest, but the psychology of hookers; it wasn't his 
style.   In the three years since he and Maggie had split,  Scott 
occassioned to spend time with many ladies.  He had kept  himself 
in reasonable shape without doing becoming fanatic about it,  and 
his high metabolism helped keep the body from degenerating  ahead 
of schedule. So he had had his share of companionship and  oppor-
tunity, but right now he was enjoying the freedom of his work and 
the pleasures that that offered.  If a woman was in the cards, so 
be it, but it was not essential at the moment.  

"Nothing, it's just that, well, I prefer to know the lady, if you 
know what I mean."

"Oh, no problem!" The Spook had an answer.  "That's an all night-
er and will cost you 1000 guilders."

"No, no," Scott said quickly.  "That's not it.  I just don't  get 
a charge from hookers.  Now, if some friends set it up to like  a 
real pick-up, at the beach, a bar, whatever, as long as I  didn't 
know.   That  could  prove interesting.  Hmmmm."   He  smiled  to 
himself.  "But  honestly?   I been a couple of  times,  just  for 
giggles.  And boy was it giggles."

Scott  laughed out loud at the memory.  "The first time it was  a 
friend's birthday and a bunch of us put up enough to get him laid 
at  the  Chicken  Ranch."  That was the evening  Scott  had  lost 
almost  two  hours of his life on the drive back  to  Vegas.   He 
speculated  to himself, in private, that he may been abducted  by 
alien creatures from a UFO.  Right.

"I know the place," added the Spook.

"I  was designated drunk driver so I drove him over to  the  high 
desert in the company van, about an hour's drive.  Before we went 
in  I insisted on a couple of beers.  He was getting laid  and  I 
was  nervous.  Go figure.  At any rate, the security cameras  let 
us in and two very attractive ladies in slinky gowns lead us over 
to  the couch.  They immediately assumed that we were both  there 
for, well, the services.  I was too embarrassed to say no, that I 
wasn't  interested,  but then out came a line of 20 of  the  most 
gorgeous girls you could imagine.  The madam, I forget her  name, 
stepped  in and begged our indulgence for the  interruption.   It 
seems, she said, that the BBC was filming a documentary on broth-
els,  and they had a camera crew in the next room, and  would  we 
mind too terribly much if they filmed us?"  Scott feigned extreme 
shock.  

"Filmed  you? For TV?  Even I won't go that far," the Spook  said 
impressed  with  Scott's  story.  "My movies are  all  first  run 
private. Alphabetical from Adelle to Zelda." 

"Not  film that, pervert!" He had pegged the Spook.   "They  only 
filmed  the selection process, the initial meetings and then  the 
walk down the hallways to the bedrooms."

"So what'd you do?" The Spook asked with interest.

"We did the camera bit, Jim got laid and I take the fifth."

"You chicken shit asshole," hollered the laughing Spook.  

Scott took that as a compliment from the male slut to whom he was 
speaking.   "Listen, that was a long time ago, before I was  mar-
ried, and I don't want it to screw up our divorce. Three years of 
bliss."  

The  Spook kept laughing. "You really are a home boy,  huh?"   He 
gasped  for air.  They continued down a side street and  back  up 
the  Oude Zijds Achterburgwal, the other main canal in  the  Dis-
trict,  so  Spook could check out more windows.  Those  with  the 
curtain drawn indicated that either services were being  rendered 
or that it was lunch hour.  Hard to tell.

As  they  passed the Guys and Gals Sex Shop, the  Spook  abruptly 
stopped  and stepped back toward the canal.  He whistled to  him-
self  in appreciation of the sex goddesses that had captured  his 
attention.  In the basement window was a stunning buxom brunette, 
wearing an invisible  g-string and bra.  She oozed sexuality with 
her  beckoning  lips  and fingers when she  spotted  the  Spook's 
interest.  In the first floor window above the brunette were  two 
perfectly  voluptuous  poster blondes,  in  matching  transparent 
peignoirs.  They too, saw the Spook, and attempted to seduce  him 
to  their doorway.  Scott was impressed that the ladies  were  so 
attractive.

"Some sweet meat, huh?" Said the Spook ogling his choices.  "Well 
are you or aren't you?" He asked with finality. "I'm all  systems 
go.   You get first choice: 2 from window A or 1 from  window  B.  
What'll it be?"

Scott responded immediately.  "I got a safer way.  There are five 
billion  people on the planet, and at any given time at  least  a 
million have to be having sex.  So all I have to do is tune  into 
the Planetary Consciousness, the ultimate archetype, and have  an 
orgasm anytime I want."

"You're a sick mother," laughed the Spook.  "Transcendental group 
sex.  At least I can tell the difference between pussy and  pray-
ing."  He asked Scott  again to pick a girl.

"I  have to pass.  It's just not my thing."  Spook glared at  him 
askance.   "No really, go ahead. I'm a bit tired, I just  arrived 
this morning."  He had forgotten to take his 3 hour afternoon nap 
and it was close to 6 in the morning body time.  "I'll see you at 
the conference tomorrow.  All right?"

"Fuckin' A!"  The Spook beamed.  "I get 'em all."  He motioned to 
the girls that he would like to hire all three of them, at  once.  
They indicated that that would be a fine idea.  "Listen, I  don't 
mean  to be rude, but . . ."  the Spook said to Scott as he  pro-
ceeded  up the stairs to meet the female triumvirate.  He  turned 
briefly in the open doorway with two of the girls tugging at  his 
clothes.  "Scott!  What happens if the medium or the message gets 
sick?  Think about it."  The door closed behind the Spook as  the 
girls shed their clothes.

"Medium?  Jeez you are really fucked," laughed Scott.  "Pervert!" 
He called out as the window curtains closed.  

Scott  got directions to the Eureka! from a live sex show  sales-
man.   For all the walking he and the Spook had done,  miles  and 
miles,  it was odd that they had ended up only a few blocks  away 
from  the hotel.  Ah, but that would figure, thought  Scott.  The 
Sex  Starved Spook was staying at the  Europa around  the  corner 
from  Sin Street.  Scott rolled a joint of his own to  enjoy  for 
the  pleasant  evening promenade home along the  canals.   Spook, 
what  a character.  In one breath, perfectly rational,  but  then 
the Jekyll and Hyde hormone hurricane. Wow.  

What  Scott  Mason could never have imagined,  indeed  quite  the 
opposite,  was that the Spook was unable to respond to the  three 
very  attentive ladies he had hired for that very purpose.  Noth-
ing.   No  matter what stimuli they effected, the  Spook's  brain 
could not command his body to respond.  His confusion  alternated 
with  embarrassment   which made the problem only  worse.   Never 
before  had  the Spook had such a problem.  Never.   One  of  the 
ladies spoke to him kindly. "Hey, it happens to everyone once  in 
a while."  At hearing that he jumped up, removed the loose condom 
and  zipped  his pants while screaming, "Not to me.   It  doesn't 
happen to me!"

Scott  did  not know that the Spook bolted into  the  street  and 
started  running, in panic, away from the scene of his most  pri-
vate  of failures.  He ran all the way, in fact beating Scott  to 
his  hotel.   He  was driven by the terror of  the  first  sexual 
failure  in his life.  The Spook felt emasculated as he sought  a 
rationalization that would allow him to retain a shred of  digni-
ty.

He  was used to commanding women, not being humiliated  by  them. 
What was wrong?  Women fell all over him, but why this?  This  of 
all things?  The Spook fell asleep on the top of his bed with his 
clothes on. 

Scott  did not know that he would not be seeing the Spook  tomor-
row.

     Wednesday, January 6
     Washington, D.C.

"Eight  more!"  exclaimed Charlie Sorenson into Martin  Templer's 
face. "What the hell is going on?"  The private office on twenti-
eth and "L" Street was well guarded by an efficient  receptionist 
who believed she worked for an international import export  firm.  
Consulting  offices  were often easier  for  senior  intelligence 
officials to use for clandestine, unrecorded meetings than  one's 
own office.  In the interest of privacy, naturally.

The two NSA and CIA agents from "P" Street held their clandestine 
meeting in a plain, windowless office meagerly furnished  with  a 
desk, a couple of chairs and a file cabinet.  

Charlie  turned  his  back on Templer and  sighed.   "I'm  sorry, 
Marty.   It's not you."  He paced to the other side of the  small 
confining  room.   "I'm getting pressure from  all  sides.   That 
damned FBI guy is making a nuisance of himself.  Asking too  many 
questions.   The  media smells a conspiracy and the  Director  is 
telling  me to ignore it."  Sorenson stood in front  of  Templer.  
"And, now, no, it's not bad enough, but 8 more of the mothers  go 
off.  Shit!"  He slammed his fist onto the desk.

"We  can  explain one to the Pentagon, but  nine?"  Martin  asked 
skeptically.  

"See what I mean?" Sorenson pointed.

Sorenson and Templer attended the ECCO and CERT roundups twice  a 
week since they began after the first EMP-T explosion.  

"These  are the Sats?" Templer leaned over to the desk.   Corners 
of several high resolution satellite photographs sneaked out from 
a  partially open folder.  Sorenson opened the folder and  spread 
the photos across the surface.  They weren't optical photographs, 
but  the  familiar map shapes of the central United  States  were 
visible behind swirls and patterns of  a spectrum of colors.  The 
cameras  and  computer had been instructed to  look  at  selected 
bandwidths,  just as infrared vision lets one see at  night.   In 
this  case, though, the filters excluded everything but  frequen-
cies of the electromagentic spectrum of interest. 

"Yeah,"  Sorenson said, pointing at one of the photos.  "This  is 
where  we found the first one."  On one of the photos,  where  an 
outline  of the United States was visible, a dot of  fuzzy  light 
was visible in the Memphis, Tennessee area.

"That's an EMP-T bomb?" asked Templer.

"The electromagnetic signature, in certain bandwidths is the same 
as  from  a nuclear detonation."  Sorenson pulled  another  photo 
out.   It was a computer enhanced blowup of the  first  satellite 
photo.  The bridges across the Mississippi were clearly  visible.  
The  small  fuzzy dot from the other photograph became  a  larger 
fuzzy cloud of white light.  

"I didn't know we had geosyncs over us, too," Templer said light-
ly. 

"Officially  we don't," Sorenson said seriously.  Then he  showed 
his teeth and said, "unofficially we have them everywhere." 

"So who was hit?"

"Here?"  He pointed at Memphis.  "Federal Express.  A  few  hours 
ago.  They're down.  Can't say when they'll be back in  business.  
Thank God no one was killed.  They weren't so lucky in Texas."

Sorenson  pulled  a couple more photographs and a fuzzy  dot  and 
it's  fuzzy cloud mate were clearly visible in the Houston  area.   
"EDS Computers," said Sorenson.  "Six dead, 15 injured.  They  do 
central  processing for hundreds of companies.  Every one,  gone. 
And then here."   He scattered more photos with the now recogniz-
able fuzzy white dots.

"Mid-State  Farm Insurance, Immigration and  Naturalization,  Na-
tional Bank, General Inter-Dynamics, CitiBank, and the Sears mail 
order  computers."   Sorenson spoke excitedly as  he  listed  the 
latest victims of the magnetic cardiac arrest that their computer 
systems, and indeed, their entire organization suffered.  

"Press?"

"Like stink on shit."

"What do they know?"

"Too much."

"What can we do?"

"Get to the bottom of this before Mason does."

****************************************************************

                         Chapter 19

     Thursday, January 7
     Amsterdam, Holland

The following morning Scott awoke without telephone  intervention 
by the front desk. He felt a little on the slow side, an observa-
tion  he  attributed to either the time difference, not  the  jet 
lag,  or the minor after effect of copius  cannabis  consumption. 
The  concierge  called a cab and Scott told the driver  where  he 
thought he was going.  Ya, no problem, it's a short ride.  

To  Scott's  surprise he found himself passing by  the  same  sex 
emporium where he had left the Spook last evening. Scott reminded 
himself  to ask Spook how it went.  The taxi stopped in front  of 
an old building that had no signs of use.  It was number 44,  but 
just in case, Scott asked the driver to wait a moment.  He walked 
up the door and finding no bell, rapped on the heavy wooden door.

"Ya?" A muffled voice asked through the door.

"Is  Jon there? This is Scott Mason."  Scott knowingly looked  at 
the cab driver.

"Who?"

Scott looked at the number again and then remembered what Jon had 
told  him.   "Sorry.  This is Repo Man.  Kirk said  you'd  expect 
me."

"Ah, ya! Repo Man."  The door opened and Scott happily waved  off 
the  cab.   "Welcome, please, come in."   Scott  entered  a  dark 
chamber as the door closed behind him.  "I am Clay, that's French 
for key."

Wonderful, thought Scott.  "Thanks for the invite.  Is Jon here?"

"Everyone is here."

"I  thought it didn't begin until eleven," Scott said looking  at 
his watch. 

"Ah,  ya, well," the Dutch accented Clay said.  "It is  difficult 
to stop sometimes.  We have been here all night."

Scott followed Clay up a darkened flight of steps.  At mid  land-
ing  Clay opened a door and suddenly the dungeon-like  atmosphere 
vanished.   Inside  the cavernous room were perhaps  200  people, 
mostly  men, excitedly conversing and huddling over computers  of 
every  imaginable model.  The high ceiling was liberally  dressed 
with  fluorescent  tubing which accentuated the green  hues  from 
many of the computer monitors.  The walls were raw brick and  the 
sparse decorations were all computer related.  Windows at the two 
ends  of the building added enough daylight to take some  of  the 
edge off of the pallid green aura. 

"What  should  I do?" Asked Scott looking around the  large  room 
which was probably overcrowded by modern safety counts.

"The  Flying Dutchman said he will see you a little later,"  Clay 
said.  "Many of our members know Repo Man is a reporter, and  you 
are free to look and ask anything. Please enjoy yourself."   Clay 
quickly disappeared into the congregation. 

Scott  suddenly  felt abandoned and wished  he  could  disappear.  
Like those dreams where you find yourself stark naked in a public 
place.   He felt that his computer naivete was written  all  over 
his  face  and he would be judged thus, so instead  he  tried  to 
ignore it by perusing the walls.  He became amused at the  selec-
tion of art, poster art, Scotch taped to the brick.

The first poster had Daffy Duck, or reasonable facsimile thereof, 
prepared  to  bring a high speed sledgehammer in contact  with  a 
keyboard.   "Hit  any key to continue," was the  simple  poster's 
message.   Another  portrayed a cobweb covered  skeleton  sitting 
behind  a  computer terminal with a repairman standing  over  him 
asking a pertinent question.  "System been down long?"

One of the ruder posters consisted of Ronald Reagan with a super-
imposed hand making a most obscene manual gesture. The poster was 
entitled, "Compute This!"

Scott  viewed  the walls as if in an art gallery, not  a  hackers 
convention.   He  openly laughed when he saw a  poster  from  the 
National  Computer  Security Center, a working  division  of  the 
National  Security  Agency.   A red, white and  blue  Uncle  Sam, 
finger   pointing,  beckoned,  "We  want  YOU!  to  secure   your 
computer."    In an open white space on the poster someone  wrote 
in,  "Please list name and date if you have already cracked  into 
an  NSA  computer."  Beneath were a long list of  Hacker  Handles 
with the dates they had entered the super secret agency's comput-
ers.  Were things really that bad, Scott asked himself.

"Repo Man?"  

Scott  turned quickly to see a large, barrel chested, red  haired 
man  with  an  untamed beard in his early  forties  approach  him 
rapidly.   The man was determined in his gait.   Scott  answered, 
"Yes . . .?

"Ya, I'm the Flying Dutchman," he said hurriedly in a large boom-
ing  voice.  "Welcome." He vigorously shook Scott's hand  with  a 
wide  smile hidden behind the bushy red face.  "You  enjoyed  Am-
sterdam last night, ya?"  He expected a positive answer.  Sex was 
no crime here.

"Well,"  Scott blushed.  "I must say it was a unique experience," 
he  said  carefully so as  not to offend Holland's  proud  hosts.  
"But I think the Spook had more fun than I did."  

The  Flying  Dutchman's  hand went limp.  "Spook?   Did  you  say 
Spook?"  His astonishment was clear.

"Yeah, why?"  Scott asked.

"The Spook?  Here?  No one has seen him in years."

"Yeah, well he's alive and well and screwing his brains out  with 
three of Amsterdam's finest," Scott said with amusement.  "What's 
the big deal?"

"The  Spook, ya this is goot," the Flying Dutchman said  clapping 
his  hands together with approval.   "He was the greatest  phreak 
of his day.  He retired years ago, and has only been seen once or 
two times maybe.  He is a legend."

"A phreak?"

"Oh,  ya, ya.  A phreak," he said speaking rapidly. "Before  home 
computers,  in the 1960's and 1970's, hacking meant fighting  the 
phone  company.  In America you call it Ma Bell, I believe.  Cap-
tain Crunch was the epitome of phone phreaks."

These  names  were a bit much, thought Scott,  but  might  add  a 
sense  of levity to his columns.  "Captain Crunch?"  Scott  asked 
with skepticism.

"Ya, Captain Crunch.  He blew the plastic whistle from a  Captain 
Crunch  cereal box into the phone," the Flying  Dutchman held  an 
invisible  whistle to his lips. "And it opened up an inside  line 
to  make long distance calls.  Then he built and sold Blue  Boxes 
which recreated the tones to make free calls."

"Phreaking and computer hacking, they're the same?"

"Ya,  ya, especially for the older hackers." The Flying  Dutchman 
patted  himself on the stomach.  "You see hacking, some  call  it 
cracking, is taking a system to its limit. Exploring it,  master-
ing the machine.  The phones, computers, viruses, it's all  hack-
ing.  You understand?"

"Spook called hacking a technique for investigating new spontane-
ously generated lifeforms.  He said a network was a living being.  
We  got into quite an argument about it."  Scott  sounded  mildly 
derisive of the theory.

The  Dutchman crossed his arms, grinned wide and rocked back  and 
forth  on  his  heels.  "Ya, ya.  That  sounds  like  the  Spook.  
Cutting to the heart of the issue.  Ya, you see, we all have  our 
reasons why we hack, but ya, Spook is right.  We forget sometimes 
that the world is one giant computer, with thousands and millions 
of  arms, just like the brain.  The neurons," he pointed  at  his 
head,  "are connected to each other with synapses.  Just  like  a 
computer network."

The Flying Dutchman's explanation was a little less ethereal than 
the Spook's and Scott found himself anticipating further enlight-
enment.  

"The  neuron is a computer.  It can function  independently,  but 
because  it's capacity is tiny, a neuron is really quite  limited 
in  what it can achieve alone.  The synapse is like  the  network 
wire,  or phone company wiring.  It connects the neurons or  com-
puters  together."  The Dutchman spoke almost religiously  as  he 
animatedly  drew wires and computers in the air to reinforce  the 
concept. "Have you heard of neural networks?"

"Absolutely," Scott said.  "The smart chips that can learn."

"Ya, exactly.  A neural network is modeled after the brain,  too.  
It is a very large number of cells, just like the brain's  cells, 
that  are  only connected to each other in the  most  rudimentary 
way."

"Like a baby's brain?" Scott offered.

"Ya,  ya,  just like a baby.  Very good.  So like the  baby,  the 
neural net grows connections as it learns.  The more  connections 
it makes, the smarter it gets."

"Both the baby and the network?"

"Ya,"  Dutchman laughed.  "So as the millions of  neural  connec-
tions  are made, some people learn skills that others  don't  and 
some  computers are better suited to certain tasks  than  others.  
And  now there's a global neural network growing.  Millions  more 
computers  are  added  and we connect them  together,  until  any 
computer  can talk to any other computer.  Ya, the Spook is  very 
much right.  The Network is alive, and it is still learning."

Scott  was  entering a world where the machines,  the  computers, 
were personified, indeed imbued with a life of their own by their 
creators  and  their programmers.  A highly complex  world  where 
inter-relatedness  is infinitely more important than the specific 
function.  Connections are issue.  Didn't Spook remind  him  that 
the medium is the message? 

But where, questioned Scott, is the line between man and machine?  
If  computers are stupid, and man must program them to give  them 
the appearance of intelligence, then the same must be true of the 
Network, the global information network.  Therefore, when a piece 
of  the  Network is programmed to learn how to  plan  for  future 
Network  expansion  and that piece of the Network  calls  another 
computer on the Network to inquire as to how it is answering  the 
same  problem  for different conditions, don't  man  and  machine 
merge?   Isn't  the Network acting as an extension of  man?   But 
then,  a  hammer is a tool as well, and no one calls a  hammer  a 
living being.

Unto  itself it is not alive, Scott reasoned. The Network  merely 
emulates the growth patterns and behavior of the cranial  highway 
system.   He was ready to concede that a network was  more  alive 
than a hammer, but he could not bring himself to carry the analo-
gy any further yet.

"That gives me a lot to think about," Scott assured the Dutchman.

"Ya, ya, it does.  Do you understand quantum physics?"

What  the hell would make him ask that question,  thought  Scott.  
"I  barely passed Quantum 101, the math was too far out  for  me, 
but,  yes," he laughed kindly, "I do remember the  basics.   Very 
basic."

"Goot.   In the global Network there is no way to  predict  where 
the  next information packet will be sent.  Will it start  here," 
the Dutchman motioned to his far left, "or here?  There's no  way 
to know.  All we can say, just as in physics, is that there is  a 
probability  of  data being transferred between any  two  points.  
Chance.  And we can also view the Network in operation as both  a 
wave and a particle."

"Wait," stopped Scott.  "You've just gone over my head, but I get 
the point, I think.  You and your associates really believe  that 
this  global  Network  is an entity unto itself and  that  it  is 
growing and evolving on its own as we speak?"

"Ya,  exactly.   You see, no one person is  responsible  for  the 
Network, its growth or its care.  Like the brain, many  different 
regions control their own piece of the Network.  And, the Network 
can still function normally even if pieces of it are  disconnect-
ed. The split brain studies."

"And you're the caretakers for the Network?" doubted Scott.

"No.  As I said we all have our reasons.  The common  denominator 
is  that we treat the Network as an incredibly powerful  organism 
about which we know very, very little.  That is our function - to 
learn."

"What is it that you do?  For a living?"

"Ah,  ya.  I am Professor of Technological Sociology at the  Uni-
versity of Amsterdam. The original proposal for my research  came 
from personal beliefs and concerns; about the way the human  race 
has to learn to cope in the face of great technology leaps.  NATO 
is funding the research."

"NATO," exclaimed Scott.  "They fund hacking?"

"No," laughed the Dutchman. "They know that hacking is  necessary 
to gather the raw data my research requires, so they pretend  not 
to notice or care.  What we are trying to do is predict what  the 
Baby,  the  global Network will look and act like when  it  grows 
up."

"Isn't crystal ball gazing easier?"

"Ya,  it  may be," the Dutchman agreed. "But now, why  don't you 
look around?  I am sure you will find it most educational."  

The  Dutchman asked again about the Spook. "Is he really here  in 
Amsterdam?"   Yup! "And he said he'd be here today?"  Yup!   "The 
Spook, at the conference? He hasn't made an appearance in years."  
Well, that's what he told me, he'd be here. 

Scott  profusely  thanked his host and assured him that  yes,  he 
would  ask  for anything he needed.  Thank you.   Kirk  had  been 
vindicated,  thought  Scott who had expected a  group  of  pimply 
faced  adolescents  with nerd shirts to be bouncing  around  like 
Spring Break in Fort Lauderdale.

Scott  slowly  explored the tables loaded with various  types  of 
computer  gear.  IBM clones were the most common, but an  assort-
ment  of  older  machines, a CP/M or two, even  a  Commodore  PET 
proved  that expensive new equipment was not needed to  become  a 
respected hacker.  Scott reminded himself that this group was the 
elite of hackerdom.  These were the Hacker's Hackers.

In his discussions with Kirk, Scott figured he would see some  of 
the  tools  of  the trade.  But he had no idea of  the  level  of 
sophistication  that  was openly, and perhaps,  illegally,  being 
demonstrated.   Then  again,  maybe that's why  they  hold  their 
Hacker Ho Downs in Amsterdam.

Scott learned something very critical early on. 

"Once you let one of us inside your computer, it's all over.  The 
system is ours."   The universal claim by hackers.

 Scott no longer had any trouble accepting that.  "So the securi-
ty  guy's  job," one short balding middle  aged  American  hacker 
said,  "is to keep us out.  I'm a cracker."  What's  that?   "The 
cracker  is kind of like a safecracker, or lock picker.  It's  my 
job to figure out how to get into the computers."   Scott had  to 
stifle  a giggle when he found out that this slight man's  handle 
was appropriately Waldo.  

Waldo went on to explain that he was a henpecked CPA who needed a 
hobby that would bore his wife to tears.  So he locked himself in 
the basement, far away from her, and got hooked on computers.  He 
found  that  rummaging  through other computers  was  an  amusing 
alternative  to  watching  Honeymooner  reruns  while  his   wife 
kvetched.   After  a while, he said he discovered that he  had  a 
talent for cracking through the front doors of computers.  On the 
professional hacker circuit that made Waldo a valuable commodity.  
The  way it works, he explained, was that he would  trade  access 
codes  for  outlines  of the contents of the  computers.   If  he 
wanted to look further, he maintained a complete indexing  system 
on the contents of thousands of computers world wide.  He  admit-
ted  it was the only exciting part of his life.  "The most fun  a 
CPA  has," he said calmly, "is cutting up client's credit  cards.  
But  me,"  he  added proudly, "I've been in and out  of  the  IRS 
computers more times than Debbie did it in Dallas."

"The IRS computers? You've been in there?"

"Where else does a CPA go, but to the scene of the crime."  Waldo 
laughed  at  his joke.  "At first it was a game, but once  I  got 
into the IRS backplane, which connects the various IRS  districts 
together,  the  things I found scared me.  No one is  in  control 
over  there.   No one.  They abuse  taxpayers,  basically  honest 
taxpayers who are genuinely in trouble and need some  understand-
ing by their government. Instead they are on the receiving end of 
a  vicious attack by a low level government paper slave who  gets 
his  thrills  by seizing property.  The IRS is  immune  from  due 
process."  Scott immediately thought of Tyrone and his  constitu-
tional ravings the other night.

"The  IRS's motto is, 'guilty until we cash the check'.  And  IRS 
management  ignores  it.  Auditors are on a quota basis,  and  if 
they don't recover their allotted amounts of back taxes, they can 
kiss  their jobs goodbye."  The innocent looking Waldo, too,  had 
found  a cause, a raison d'ˆtre, for hacking away  at  government 
computers.

"You know that for a fact?" Asked Scott.  This alone was a  major 
story.   Such  a policy was against everything  the  Constitution 
stood  for.  Waldo nodded and claimed to have seen  the  internal 
policy  memoranda.  Who was in charge?  Essentially, said  Waldo, 
no one.  It was anarchy.

"They  have the worst security of any agency that should  by  all 
rights  have the best.  It's a crime against  American  citizens.  
Our  rights and our privacy have shriveled to  nothing."   Waldo, 
the  small CPA, extolled the virtues of fighting the system  from 
within.   From  within  he could battle the  computers  that  had 
become the system.

"Have you ever, shall I say, fixed files in the IRS computers?"

"Many times," Waldo said proudly.  "For my clients who were being 
screwed,  sometimes  I am asked to help.  It's all  part  of  the 
job," he said of his beloved avocation.

"How  many  systems have you cracked?" Asked Scott,  visibly  im-
pressed.

"I  am,"  Waldo said modestly, "the best.  I  have  cracked  1187 
systems  in 3 years. 1040 was my personal goal for a while,  then 
1099, but it's kind of open ended now."

"That's almost one a day?"

"You  could look at it like that, but sometimes you can get  into 
10  or twenty in one day.  You gotta remember," Waldo  said  with 
pride, "a lot of homework goes into this.  You just don't  decide 
one day to crack a system.  You have to plan it."

"So how do you do it?"

"O.K., it's really pretty simple. D'you speak software?"

"Listen, you make it real simple, and I won't interrupt. OK?"  

"Interrupt. Hah! That's a good one.  Here, let me show you on the 
computer," Waldo said as he leaned over to peck at the  keyboard.  
"The  first step to getting into computers is to find where  they 
are  located, electronically speaking, O.K.?"  Scott agreed  that 
you needed the address of the bank before you could rob it.

"So what we do is search for computers by running a program, like 
an exchange autodialer.  Here, look here," Waldo said pointing at 
the  computer screen.  "We select the area code here,  let's  say 
203,  that's  Connecticut.  Then we pick the  prefix,  the  first 
three  numbers, that's the local exchange. So let's choose  968," 
he entered the numbers carefully. "That's Stamford.  By the  way, 
I wrote this software myself."  Waldo spoke of his software as  a 
proud  father would of his first born son.  Scott patted  him  on 
the back, urging him to continue.

"So we ask the computer to call every number in the 203-968  area 
sequentially.   When the number is answered, my computer  records 
whether  a voice, a live person answered, or a computer  answered 
or  if  it  was a fax machine."  Scott never  had  imagined  that 
hacking was so systematic. 

"Then,  the computer records its findings and we have a  complete 
list of every  computer in that area," Waldo concluded.

"That's  10,000  phone calls," Scott realized.  "It must  cost  a 
fortune and take forever?"

"Nah,  not a dime. The phone company has a hole.    It  takes  my 
program  less than a second to record the response and we're  off 
to  the  next  call.   It's all free,  courtesy  of  TPC,"  Waldo 
bragged.

"TPC?" Questioned Scott.

"The Phone Company," Waldo chuckled.  

"I  don't see how you can do the entire country that way,  10,000 
calls at a shot.  In New York there must be ten million phones."

"Yes,"  agreed Waldo, "it is a never ending job.   Phone  numbers 
change,  computers  come and go, security gets better.   But  you 
have to remember, there are a lot of other people out there doing 
the  same thing, and we all pool our information.  You could  ask 
for  the number to almost any computer in the world, and  someone 
in  our  group, somewhere, will have the number  and  likely  the 
passwords."

"Jesus . . ."

"I run my program at night, every night, when I sleep.  On a good 
night,  if  the  calls are connected quickly  enough,  I  can  go 
through about a thousand phone numbers.  I figure roughly a month 
per prefix."

"I am amazed, simply amazed. Truly impressed," said Scott.   "You 
know,  you always kind of imagine these things are possible,  but 
until it stares you in the face it's black magic."

"You  wanna  know the best part?" Waldo said teasingly.   "I  get 
paid for it, too."  Waldo crouched over and spoke to Scott secre-
tively.   "Not everyone here approves, but, I sell lists to  junk 
fax mail-order houses.  They want the fax lists.  On a good night 
I can clear a couple hundred while my modem does the dialing."

The underground culture of Scott's day, demonstrating against the 
war, getting gassed while marching by George Washington Universi-
ty, getting thrown out of a Nixon rally at  Madison Square Garden 
seemed so innocent in comparison.    He continued to be in awe of 
the  possible applications for a technology not as benign as  its 
creators had intended.

Scott  met other hackers; they were proud of the term  even  with 
the current negative connotations it carried.  He saw how system-
ic  attacks against the front door to computers were  the  single 
biggest  challenge  to hackers; the proverbial chase  before  the 
catch, the romance to many.  

At another tabletop laden with computers Scott learned that there 
are  programs  designed  to try passwords  according  to  certain 
rules.   Some try every possible combination of letters and  num-
bers,  although  that is considered an antique  method  of  brute 
force.  More sophisticated hackers use advanced algorithms  which 
try to open the computer with 'likely' passwords. <MI>It was all 
very scientific, the approach to the problem<D>, thought Scott.

He  met  communications gurus who knew more about  the  switching 
networks inside the phone company than AT&T engineers.  They  had 
complete diagrams and function calls and source code for even the 
latest software revisions on the 4ESS and the new 5ESS  switches.  
"Once  you're  into the phone computers," one  phone  phreak  ex-
tolled, "you have an immense amount of power at your  fingertips.  
Incredible.  Let me give you an example."  

The  speaker  was  another American, one that  Scott  would  have 
classified  as  an ex-Berkeley-hippie still living in  the  past.  
His  dirty shoulder length hair capped a skinny frame which  held 
his  jeans up so poorly that there was no question where the  sun 
didn't shine.  

"You  know  that  the phone company is part  of  the  Tri-Lateral 
Commission,  working with Kissinger and the Queen of  England  to 
control  the world.  Right?"  His frazzled speech was matched  by 
an annoying habit of sweeping his stringy hair off his face every 
few words.  "It's up to us to stop them."  

Scott  listened politely as Janis, (who adopted the moniker  from 
his  favorite singer) rewrote history with tortured  explanations 
of  how  the  phone company is the hidden seat  of  the  American 
government,  and how they have been lying to the public for  dec-
ades.  And the Rockefellers are involved too, he assured Scott.  

"They  could declare martial law, today, and take over the  coun-
try.  Those who control the communications control the power," he 
oracled.   "Did  you know," he took Scott  into  his  confidence, 
"that  phones  are always on and they  have  computers  recording 
everything  you  say and do in your own home.   That's  illegal!" 
Janis bellowed.  Not to mention crazy, thought Scott.

One of Janis' associates came over to rescue Scott.  "Sorry, he's 
a  little enthusiastic and has some trouble communicating on  the 
Earthly plane."   Alva, as he called himself, explained coherent-
ly  that with some of the newer security systems in place, it  is 
necessary  to  manipulate  the phone company  switches  to  learn 
system passwords.

"For  example, when we broke into a Bell computer that  used  CI-
CIMS, it was tough to crack.  But now they've added new  security 
that, in itself, is flawless, albeit crackable,"  Alva explained.  
"Once  you get past the passwords, which is trivial,  the  system 
asks you three unique questions about yourself for final  identi-
fication.   Pretty smart, huh?"  Scott agreed with Alva, a  voice 
of  apparent moderation.  "However, we were already in the  phone 
switch computer, so we programmed in forwarding instructions  for 
all  calls that dialed that particular computer.  We then  inter-
cepted  the call and connected it to our computer, where we  emu-
late  the security system, and watched the questions and  answers 
go back and forth.  After a few hours, you have a hundred differ-
ent  passwords to use. There are a dozen other ways to do it,  of 
course."

"Of  course," Scott said sarcastically.  Is nothing sacred?   Not 
in this world it's not.  All's fair in love, war and hacking. 

The time flew as Scott learned what a tightly knitted clique  the 
hackers were.  The ethos 'honor among thieves' held true here  as 
it  did in many adolescent societies, most recently the  American 
Old  West.   As  a group, perhaps even a  subculture,  they  were 
arduously  taming new territory, each with their own vision of  a 
private  digital  homestead.  Each one taking on  the  system  in 
their  own  way, they still needed each other, thus  they  looked 
aside  if  another's techno-social behavior was  personally  dis-
tasteful.  The  Network was big enough for everyone.   A  working 
anarchy  that heralded the standard of John Paul Jones  as  their 
sole commandment: Don't Tread On Me.

He saw tapping devices that allowed the interception of  computer 
data which traveled over phone lines.  Line Monitors and Sniffers 
were commercially available, and legal; equipment that was  nomi-
nally designed to troubleshoot networks. In the hands of a  hack-
er,  though,  it  graduated from being a  tool of  repair  to  an 
offensive weapon.  

Small  hand held radios were capable of listening in to  the  in-
creasingly popular remote RF networks which do not require wires. 
Cellular phone eavesdropping devices permitted the owner to  scan 
and focus on the conversation of his choice.  Scott examined  the 
electronic gear to find a manufacturer's identification.

"Don't  bother,  my friend," said a long haired German  youth  of 
about twenty.

"Excuse me?"

"I see you are looking for marks, yes?"

"Well, yes.  I wanted to see who made these . . ."

"I  make them, he makes them, we all make them," he  said  almost 
giddily.   "This is not available from Radio Shack," he  giggled.  
"Who  needs them from the establishment when they are so easy  to 
build."

Scott  knew  that electronics was indeed a garage  operation  and 
that  many  high  tech initiatives had  begun  in  entrepreneur's 
basements.   The  thought of home  hobbyists  building  equipment 
which  the  military defends against was anathema to  Scott.   He 
merely  shook his head and moved on, thanking the makers  of  the 
eavesdropping machines for their demonstrations.

Over  in a dimly lit corner, dimmer than elsewhere, Scott  saw  a 
number  of people fiddling with an array of computers and  equip-
ment  that  looked surprisingly familiar.  As  he  approached  he 
experienced  an  immediate rush of d‚ja vu.   This was  the  same 
type of equipment that he had seen on the van before it was blown 
up a couple of months ago. Tempest busting, he thought.

The group was speaking in German, but they were more than glad to 
switch to English for Scott's benefit.  They sensed his  interest 
as  he poked around the assorted monitors and antennas  and  test 
equipment.

"Ah,  you  are interested in Van Eck?" asked one  of  the  German 
hackers.   They  maintained a clean cut appearance,  and  through 
discussion   Scott  learned that they were funded as  part  of  a 
university research project in Frankfurt.  

Scott watched and listened as they set up a compelling demonstra-
tion.   First,  one computer screen displayed a  complex  graphic 
picture.   Several yards away another computer displayed a  foggy 
image  that cleared as one of the students adjusted  the  antenna 
attached to the computer.  

"Aha! Lock!" one of them said, announcing that the second comput-
er would now display everything that the first computer did.  The 
group played with color and black and white graphics, word  proc-
essing  screens  and  spreadsheets.  Each time, in  a  matter  of 
seconds, they 'locked' into the other computer successfully.

Scott  was  duly impressed and asked them why they  were  putting 
effort into such research.  "Very simple," the apparent leader of 
the Frankfurt group said.  "This work is classified in both  your 
country  and  mine, so we do not have access to  the  answers  we 
need.  So, we build our own and now it's no more classified.  You 
see?"

"Why do you need it?"

"To  protect against it," they said in near unison.    "The  next 
step is to build efficient methods to fight the Van Eck."

"Doesn't Tempest do that?"

"Tempest?"  the senior student said.  "Ha! It makes the  computer 
weigh a thousand pounds and the monitor hard to read.  There  are 
better  ways  to  defend.  To defend we must first  know  how  to 
attack. That's basic."

"Let  me ask you something," Scott said to the group after  their 
lengthy  demonstration.  "Do you know anything about  electromag-
netic pulses?  Strong ones?"

"Ya.  You mean like from a nuclear bomb?"

"Yes, but smaller and designed to only hurt computers."

"Oh,  ya.   We  have wanted to build one, but it  is  beyond  our 
means."

"Well," Scott said smugly, "someone is building them and  setting 
them off."

"Your  stock exchange.  We thought that the  American  government 
did it to prove they could."

An  hour of ensuing discussion taught Scott that  the  technology 
that  the DoD and the NSA so desperately spent billions  to  keep 
secret and proprietary was in common use.  To most engineers, and 
Scott  could  easily relate, every problem has  an  answer.   The 
challenge  is to accomplish the so-called impossible.  The  engi-
neer's pride.

Jon,  the  Flying Dutchman finally rescued Scott's  stomach  from 
implosion.   "How  about lunch?  A few of the guys want  to  meet 
you.  Give you a heavy dose of propaganda," he threatened. 

"Thank  God! I'm famished and haven't touched the stuff all  day.  
Love to,  it's on me," Scott offered.  He could see Doug having a 
cow.  How could he explain a thousand dollar dinner for a hundred 
hungry hackers? 

"Say that too loud," cautioned the bearded Dutchman, "and  you'll 
have  to buy the restaurant.  Hacking isn't very high on the  pay 
scale."

"Be easy on me, I gotta justify lunch for an army to my boss,  or 
worse  yet, the beancounters."  Dutchman didn't catch the  idiom.  
"Never mind, let's keep it to a small regiment, all right?"

He  never figured out how it landed on his shoulders,  but  Scott 
ended  up  with the responsibility of picking  a  restaurant  and 
successfully  guiding the group there. And Dutchman  had  skipped 
out without notifying anyone.  Damned awkward, thought Scott.  He 
assumed control, limited though it was, and led them to the  only 
restaurant he knew, the Sarang Mas.  The group blindly and happi-
ly  followed.   They even let him order the food, so he  did  his 
very  best  to impress them by ordering without  looking  at  the 
menu.   He succeeded, with his savant phonetic memory,  to  order 
exactly  what he had the night prior, but this time he asked  for 
vastly greater portions.

As  they  were  sating their pallets, and commenting  on  what  a 
wonderful  choice  this  restaurant was, Scott  popped  the  same 
question  to  which he had previously been unable  to  receive  a 
concise  answer.  Now that he had met this bunch,  he  would  ask 
again,  and if lucky, someone might respond and actually be  com-
prehensible. 

"I've  been asking the same question since I got into this  whole 
hacking  business," Scott said savoring goat parts  and  sounding 
quite nonchalant. "And I've never gotten a straight answer.   Why 
do  you hack?" He asked. "Other than the philosophical  credo  of 
Network is Life, why do you hack?"  Scott looked into their eyes.  
"Or are you just plain nosy?"

"I bloody well am!" said the one called Pinball who spoke with  a 
thick  Liverpudlian  accent.  His jeans were in  tatters,  in  no 
better  shape  than his sneakers.  The short pudgy man  was  mid-
twenty-ish and his tall crewcut was in immediate need of  reshap-
ing. 

"Nosy?  That's why you hack?" Asked Scott in disbelief.

"Yeah,  that's  it,  mate. It's great fun.  A game  the  size  of 
life."   Pinball  looked at Scott as if to say,  that's  it.   No 
hidden  meaning, it's just fun.  He swallowed more of the  exqui-
site food.  

"Sounds  like whoever dies with the most hacks wins," Scott  said 
facetiously.

"Right. You got it, mate." Pinball never looked up from his  food 
while talking.

Scott scanned his luncheon companions for reaction.  A couple  of 
grunts, no objection.  What an odd assortment, Scott thought.  At 
least  the  Flying Dutchman had been kind enough to  assemble  an 
English speaking group for Scott's benefit.

"We  each  have  our reasons to hack," said the  one  who  called 
himself Che2.  By all appearance Che2 seemed more suited to a BMW 
than a revolutionary cabal.  He was a well bred American, dressed 
casually but expensively.  "We may not agree with each other,  or 
anyone,  but we have an underlying understanding that permits  us 
to cooperate."

"I can tell you why I hack," said the sole German  representative 
at the table who spoke impeccable English with a thick accent  "I 
am  a professional ethicist.  It is people like me who help  gov-
ernments  formulate rules that decide who lives and who  dies  in 
emergency  situations.   The right or wrong of  weapons  of  mass 
destruction.   Ethics  is a social moving target that  must  con-
stantly  be  re-examined  as we as a civilized  people  grow  and 
strive to maintain our innate humanity."

"So  you  equate hacking and ethics, in the same  breath?"  Scott 
asked.

"I  certainly  do," said the middle aged German hacker  known  as 
Solon. "I am part of a group that promotes the Hacker Ethic.   It 
is really quite simple, if you would be interested."  Scott urged 
him  to  continue.  "We have before us, as a world,  a  marvelous 
opportunity,  to  create a set of rules, behavior  and  attitudes 
towards  this  magnificent technology that  blossoms  before  our 
eyes.   That law is the Ethic, some call it the Code."  Kirk  had 
called it the Code, too.  

"The Code is quite a crock," interrupted a tall slender man  with  
disheveled  white  hair who spoke with an upper  crust,  ever  so 
proper   British accent.  "Unless everybody follows it, from A to 
Zed,  it simply won't work.  There can be no exceptions.   Other-
wise my friends, we will find ourselves in a technological   Lord 
of the Flies."

"Ah, but that is already happening," said a gentleman in his mid- 
fifties,  who also sported a full beard, bushy mustache and  long 
well kept salt and pepper hair to his shoulders.  "We are already 
well on the road to a date with Silicon Armageddon.  We didn't do 
it  with the Bomb, but it looks like we're sure as hell gonna  do 
it  with  technology for the masses.  In  this  case  computers."  
Going only by 'Dave', he was a Philosophy Professor at  Stanford.  
In  many ways he spoke like the early Timothy Leary, using  tech-
nology  instead of drugs as a mental catalyst.  Scott  though  of 
Dave as the futurist in the group.  

"He's  right. It is happening, right now.  Long Live the  Revolu-
tion," shouted Che2.  "Hacking keeps our personal freedoms alive.  
I know I'd much prefer everyone knowing my most intimate  secrets 
than have the government and TRW and the FBI and the CIA  control 
it and use only pieces of it for their greed-sucking reasons.  No 
way.   I want everyone to have the tools to get into the  Govern-
ment's Big Brother computer system and make the changes they  see 
fit."   

Scott  listened as his one comment spawned a heated and  animated 
discussion.   He  wouldn't  break in unless  they  went  too  far 
afield, wherever that was, or he simply wanted to join in on  the 
conversation.

"How can you support freedom without responsibility?  You contra-
dict yourself by ignoring the Code."  Solon made his comment with 
Teutonic matter of factness in between mouthfuls. 

"It is the most responsible thing we can do," retorted Che2.  "It 
is our moral duty, our responsibility to the world to protect our 
privacy,  our rights, before they are stripped away as they  have 
been since the Republicans bounced in, but not out, over a decade 
ago."  He turned in his chair and glared at Scott.  Maybe  thirty 
years  old, Che2 was mostly bald with great bushes of curly  dark 
brown  hair encircling his head. The lack of hair emphasized  his 
large  forehead  which stood over his deeply  inset  eyes.   Che2 
called  the  Boston  area his home but  his  cosmopolitan  accent 
belied his background. 

The proper British man known as Doctor Doctor, DRDR on the BBS's, 
was  over six foot five with an unruly frock of thick white  hair 
which  framed  his ruddy pale face.  "I do beg your  pardon,  but 
this  so  violates the tenets of civilized behavior.   What  this 
gentleman  proposes  is the philosophical  antithesis  of  common 
sense  and rationality.  I suggest we consider the position  that 
each of us in actual fact is working for the establishment, if  I 
may  use  such a politically pass‚ descriptor."   DRDR's  comment 
hushed  the table.  He continued.  "Is it not true that  security 
is being installed as a result of many of our activities?"  

Several nods of agreement preceded a small voice coming from  the 
far  end  of the table.  "If you want to call  it  security."   A 
small pre-adolescent spoke in a high pitched whine. 

"What do you mean . . .I'm sorry, I don't know what to call you," 
asked Scott.

"GWhiz.  The security is a toy."

GWhiz spoke unpretentiously about how incredibly simple it is  to 
crack any security system.  He maintained that there are theoret-
ical methods to crack into any, and he emphasized any,  computer.  
"It's impossible to protect a computer 100%.  Can't be done.   So 
that  means  that every computer is crackable."   He  offered  to 
explain  the  math  to Scott who politely  feigned  ignorance  of 
decimal  points.   "In   short, I, or anyone, can  get  into  any 
computer they want.  There is always a way."

"Isn't  that a scary thought?" Scott asked to no one in  particu-
lar.

Scott  learned from the others that GWhiz was a 16 year old  high 
school junior from Phoenix, Arizona.  He measured on the high-end 
of  the genius scale, joined Mensa at 4 and already had  in  hand 
scholarships  from Westinghouse,  Mellon, CalTech, MIT,  Stanford 
to name a few.  At the tender age of 7 he started programming and 
was now fluent in eleven computer languages.  GWhiz was  regarded 
with an intellectual awe from hackers for his theoretical  analy-
ses  that  he had turned into hacking tools.  He  was  a  walking 
encyclopedia of methods and techniques to both protect and attack 
computers.   To GWhiz, straddling the political fence  by  arming 
both  sides  with the same weapons was a logical  choice.   Scott 
viewed  it as a high tech MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction,  com-
puter wise. 

"Don't  you see," said the British DRDR, continuing as  if  there 
had  been  no interruption.  "The media portrays us  as  security 
breaking phreaks, and that's exactly what we are.  And that works 
for the establishment as well.  We keep the designers and securi-
ty people honest by testing their systems for free.  What a great 
deal,  don't  you think?  We, the hackers of the world,  are  the 
Good Housekeeping Seal of security systems by virtue of the  fact 
that  either we can or we cannot penetrate them.  If  that's  not 
working for the system, I don't know what is."

"DRDR's  heading down the right path,"  Dave the  futurist  spoke 
up.  "Even though he does work for GCHQ."

"GCHQ?" Scott asked quickly.

"The English version of your NSA," said Pinball, still  engrossed 
in his food.

"I do not!"  protested DRDR.  "Besides, what difference would  it 
make if I did?" He asked more defensively. 

"None,  none  at  all," agreed Dave.  "The effect  is  the  same.  
However, if you are an MI-5 or MI-6 or whatever, that would  show 
a  great  deal  of unanticipated foresight on the  part  of  your 
government.   I wish ours would think farther ahead than  today's 
headlines.  I have found that people everywhere in the world  see 
the problem as one of hackers, rather than the fundamental issues 
that are at stake.  We hackers are manifestations of the problems 
that  technology  has bequeathed us.  If any of  our  governments 
were  actually  responsive enough to listen, they  would  have  a 
great  deal  of  concern for  the  emerging  infrastructure  that 
doesn't  have a leader.  Now, I'm not taking a side on this  one, 
but  I am saying that if I were the government, I would  sure  as 
all hell want to know what was going on in the trenches. The U.S. 
especially."

Everyone seemed to agree with that.  

"But they're too caught up in their own meaningless self-sustain-
ing parasitic lives to realize that a new world is shaping around 
them."   When Che2 spoke, he spoke his mind, leaving no doubt  as 
to how he felt.  "They don't have the smarts to get involved  and 
see  it first hand.  Which is fine by me, because, as you  said," 
he  said  pointing at DRDR, "it doesn't  matter.   They  wouldn't 
listen  to  him anyway.  It gives us more time to  build  in  de-
fenses."

"Defenses against what?" asked Scott.

"Against them, of course," responded Che2.  "The fascist military 
industrial  establishment keeps us under a  microscope.   They're 
scared  of  us.  They have spent tens of billions of  dollars  to 
construct  huge computers,  built into the insides of  mountains, 
protected from nuclear attack. In them are data bases about  you, 
and me, and him and hundreds of millions of others.  There are  a 
lot  of  these systems, IRS, the Census Department has  one,  the 
FBI,  the DIA, the CIA, the NSA, the OBM, I can go  on."   Che2's 
voice crescendo'd and he got more demonstrative as the importance 
he  attributed to each subject increased.  "These computers  con-
tain the most private information about us all.  I for one,  want 
to  prevent them from ever using that information against  me  or 
letting others get at it either.  Unlike those who feel that  the 
Bill  of  Rights should be re-interpreted and re-shaped  and  re-
packaged  to feed their power frenzy, I say it's worked  for  200 
years and I don't want to fix something if it ain't broke."

"One  needs to weigh the consequences of breaking and entering  a 
computer, assay the purpose, evaluate the goal against the possi-
ble negatives before wildly embarking through a foreign computer.  
That  is  what we mean by the Code."  Solon  spoke  English  with 
Teutonic  precision and a mild lilt that gave his accented  words 
additional credibility.  He sounded like an expert.  "I  believe, 
quite  strongly,  that it is not so complicated to have  a  major 
portion of the hacker community live by the Code.  Unless you are 
intent on damage, no one should have any trouble with the  simple 
Credo,  'leave  things  as you found them'.  You  see,  there  is 
nothing  wrong  with breaking security as long as  you're  accom-
plishing something useful."

"Hold on," interrupted Scott.  "Am I hearing this right?   You're 
saying  that it's all right to break into a computer as  long  as 
you  don't  do any damage, and put everything  right  before  you 
leave?"

"That's  about  it.  It is so simple, yet so  blanketing  in  its 
ramifications.  The beauty of the Code, if everyone lived by  it, 
would  be  a maximization of computer resources.   Now,  that  is 
good for everyone."

"Wait,  I can't stand this, wait," said Scott holding  his  hands 
over  his head in surrender.  He elicited a laugh  from  everyone 
but Che2.  "That's like saying, it's O.K. for you to come into my 
house when I'm not there, use the house, wash the dishes, do  the 
laundry,  sweep up and split.  I have a real problem  with  that.  
That's  an invasion of my privacy and I would  personally  resent 
the shit out of it."  Scott tried this line of reasoning again as 
he had with Kirk.

"Just  the point," said DRDR.  "When someone breaks into a  house 
it's a civil case.  But this new bloody Computer Misuse Act makes 
it a felony to enter a computer.  Parliament isn't 100% perfect," 
he added comically.  DRDR referred to the recent British attempts 
at legislative guidelines to criminalize certain computer activi-
ties.

"As  you  should resent it."  Dave jumped in speaking  to  Scott.  
"But there's a higher purpose here.  You resent your house  being 
used  by  an uninvited guest in your absence. Right?"   Scott  a-
greed.   "Well,  let's  say that you are going to  Hawaii  for  a 
couple  of weeks, and someone discovers that your house is  going 
to be robbed while you're gone.  So instead of bothering you,  he 
house  sits.   Your house doesn't get robbed,  you  return,  find 
nothing amiss, totally unaware of your visitor.  Would you rather 
get robbed instead?"

"Well,  I  certainly don't want to get robbed, but . . .  I  know 
what  it  is.  I'm out of control and my privacy is  still  being 
violated.  I don't know if I have a quick answer."  Scott  looked 
and sounded perplexed.

"Goot!   You should not have a quick answer, for that  answer  is 
the core, the essence of the ultimate problem that we all  inves-
tigate every day." Solon gestured to their table of seven.  "That 
question is security versus freedom.  Within the world of  acade-
mia there is a strong tendency to share everything.  Your  ideas, 
your thoughts, your successes and failures, the germs of an  idea 
thrown away and the migration of a brainstorm into the  tangible.  
They  therefore desire complete freedom of information  exchange, 
they  do not wish any restrictions on their freedom to  interact.  
However,  the  Governments of the world want to isolate  and  re-
strict  access  to information; right or  wrong,  we  acknowledge 
their  concern.   That is the other side, security  with  minimal 
freedom.   The  banks also prefer security to  freedom,  although 
they  do it very poorly and give it a lot, how do you say, a  lot 
of lip service?" 

Everyone agreed that describing a bank's security as lip  service 
was entirely too complimentary, but for the sake of brevity  they 
let it go uncontested.

"Then again, business hasn't made up  its mind as to whether they 
should  bother protecting information assets or not.   So,  there 
are  now four groups with different needs and desires which  vary 
the  ratio of freedom to security.  In reality, of course,  there 
will  be hundreds of opinions," Solon added for accuracy's  sake.  
"Mathematically,  if there is no security, dividing by 0  results 
in  infinite  freedom.  Any security at all and some  freedom  is 
curtailed.   So, therein the problem to be solved.  At what  cost 
freedom?   It is an age old question that every  generation  must 
ask,  weigh and decide for itself.  This generation will  do  the 
same for information and freedom.  They are inseparable."

Scott  soaked in the words and wanted to think about them  later, 
at  his  leisure.   The erudite positions taken  by  hackers  was 
astonishing  compared to what he had expected.  Yes, some of  the 
goals  and  convictions were radical to say the  least,  but  the 
arguments were persuasive. 

"Let  me ask you," Scott said to the group.  "What  happens  when 
computers are secure?  What will you do then?"

"They  won't get secure," GWhiz said.  "As soon as they  come  up 
with a defense, we will find a way around it."

"Won't that cycle ever end?"

"Technology  is  in  the hands of the  people,"  commented  Che2.  
"This is the first time in history when the power is not  concen-
trated  with  a  select few.  The ancients kept  the  secrets  of 
writing  with their religious leaders;  traveling by ship in  the 
open  sea was a hard learned and noble skill.  Today, weapons  of 
mass  destruction  are  controlled by a few mad men  who  are  no 
better than you or I.  But now, computers, access to information, 
that power will never be taken away.  Never!"

"It  doesn't  matter."  Dave was viewing the future  in  his  own 
mind.  "I doubt that computers will ever be secure, but  instead, 
the barrier, the wall, the time and energy it takes to crack into 
them  will  become prohibitive for all but the  most  determined.  
Anyway, there'll be new technology to explore."

"Like what?" Asked Scott.

"Satellites are pretty interesting.  They are a natural extension 
of the computer network, and cracking them will be lots easier in 
a couple of years."  DRDR saw understanding any new technology as 
apersonal challenge.

"How do you crack a satellite?  What's there to crack?"

"How  about  beaming your own broadcasts to  millions  of  people 
using  someone  else's satellite?" DRDR speculated.   "It's  been 
done before, and as the equipment gets cheaper, I can assure  you 
that  we'll  be seeing many more political  statements  illegally 
being  made over the public airwaves.  The BBC and NBC will  have 
their  hands full.   In the near future, I see virtual  realities 
as an ideal milieu for next generation hackers."

"I agree," said Solon.  "And with virtual realities, the  ethical 
issues are even more profound than with the Global Network."

Scott  held  up  his hands.  "I know what _I_ think  it  is,  but 
before you go on, I need to know how you define a virtual  reali-
ty."  The hackers looked at each until Dave took the ball.

"A  virtual reality is fooling the mind and body  into  believing 
something  is  real that isn't real."  Scott's  face  was  blank.  
"Ever  been  to Disneyland?"  Dave asked.   Scott  nodded.   "And 
you've ridden Star Tours?"  Scott nodded again.  "Well, that's  a 
simple virtual reality.  Star Tours fools your body into thinking 
that you are in a space ship careening through an asteroid  belt, 
but  in  reality,  you are suspended on a few  guy  wires.    The 
projected image reinforces the sensory hallucination."

"Now  imagine a visual field, currently it's done  with  goggles, 
that creates real life pictures, in real time and interacts  with 
your movements."

Scott's light bulb went off.  "That's like the Holo-Deck on  Star 
Trek!"

"That is the ultimate in virtual reality, yes.  But before we can 
achieve  that, imagine sitting in a virtual cockpit of a  virtual 
car, and seeing exactly what you would see from a race car at the 
Indy  500. The crowds, the noises, and just as  importantly,  the 
feel of the car you are driving.  As you drive, you shift and the 
car  reacts,  you feel the car react.  You  actually  follow  the 
track  in  the path that you steer.  The  combination  of  sight, 
sound  and  hearing, even smell, creates a  total  illusion.   In 
short,  there is no way to distinguish between reality and  delu-
sion."

"Flight simulators for the people," chimed in Che2.

"I  see  the  day when every Mall in America  will  have  Virtual 
Reality  Parlors where you can live out your fantasies.  No  more 
than 5 years," Dave confidently prognosticated.

Scott  imagined the Spook's interpretation of virtual  realities.  
He  immediately conjured up the memory of Woody Allen's  Orgasma-
tron  in  the movie Sleeper.  The hackers claimed  that  computer 
generated sex was less than ten years away.

"And  that  will be an ideal terrain for hackers.  That  kind  of 
power over the mind can be used for terrible things, and it  will 
be  up to us to make sure it's not abused."  Che2 maintained  his 
position of guardian of world freedom. 

As  they  finished  their lunch and Scott paid  the  check,  they 
thanked  him vigorously for the treat.  They might be  nuts,  but 
they were polite, and genuine. 

"I'm  confused  about  one thing," Scott said as  they  left  the 
restaurant  and walked the wide boulevard.  "You all advocate  an 
independence,  an anarchy where the individual is paramount,  and 
the  Government  is worse than a necessary evil.   Yet  I  detect 
disorganization, no plan; more like a leaf in a lake, not knowing 
where  it  will go next."  There were no disagreements  with  his 
summary assessment.

"Don't  any of you work together?  As a group, a kind of a  gang?  
It  seems to me that if there was an agenda, a program, that  you 
might achieve your aims more quickly."  Scott was trying to avoid 
being critical by his inquisitiveness. 

"Then we would be a government, too, and that's not what we want.  
This  is about individual power, responsibility.  At any rate,  I 
don't  think  you  could find two of us in  enough  agreement  on 
anything  to   build a platform."  As usual, Solon  maintained  a 
pragmatic approach.  

"Well," Scott mused out loud. "What would happen if a group, like 
you,  got  together and followed a game plan.  Built  a  hacker's 
guide  book  and  stuck to it, all for a common  cause,  which  I 
realize  is  impossible.   But for argument's  sake,  what  would 
happen?"

"That would be immense power," said Che2.  "If there were enough, 
they could do pretty much what they wanted.  Very political."

"I  would see it as dangerous, potentially very dangerous,"  com-
mented DRDR.  He pondered the question.  "The effects of  synergy 
in  any endeavor are unpredictable.  If they worked as  group,  a 
unit,  it is possible that they would be a force to  be  reckoned 
with."

"There  would be only one word for it," Dave said with  finality.  
"They  could easily become a strong and deadly opponent if  their 
aims are not benevolent.  Personally, I would have to call such a 
group, terrorists."

"Sounds like the Freedom League," Pinball said off handedly.

Scott's  head  jerked toward Pinball.  "What  about  the  Freedom 
League?" he asked pointedly. 

"All I said is that this political hacking sounds like the  Free-
dom  League,"  Pinball said innocently.  "They bloody well go  on 
for  a fortnight and a day about how software should be  free  to 
anyone  that  needs it, and that only those that  can  afford  it 
should pay.  Like big corporations."

"I've heard of Freedom before," piped Scott.

"The  Freedom League is a huge BBS, mate.  They have hundreds  of 
local BBS's around the States, and even a few across the pond  in 
God's country.  Quite an operation, if I say."

Pinball  had  Scott's full attention.  "They run the  BBS's,  and 
have an incredible shareware library.  Thousands of programs, and 
they give them all away."

"It's very impressive," Dave said giving credit where credit  was 
due.   "They  prove that software can  be  socially  responsible.  
We've been saying that for years."

"What  does anybody know about this Freedom League?" Scott  asked 
suspiciously.  

"What's  to  know?  They've been around for years, have  a  great 
service, fabulous BBS's, and reliable software."

"It  just sounds too good to be true,"  Scott mused as they  made 
it back to the warehouse for more hours of education.

* * * * *

Until  late that night, Scott continued to elicit viewpoints  and 
opinions  and  political positions from the  radical  underground 
elements of the 1990's he had traveled 3000 miles to meet.   Each 
encounter, each discussion, each conversation yielded yet another 
perspective  on the social rational for hacking and the  invasion 
of privacy.    Most everyone at the InterGalactic Hackers Confer-
ence  had heard about Scott, the Repo Man,  and knew why  he  was 
there.   He was accepted as a fair and impartial  observer,  thus 
many  of them made a concerted effort to preach their  particular 
case to him. By midnight, overload had consumed Scott and he made 
a polite exit, promising to return the following day.  

Still, no one had heard from or seen the Spook.  

Scott walked back to his hotel through the Red Light District and 
stopped to purchase a souvenir or two.  The sexually explicit  T- 
Shirts  would have both made Larry Flynt blush and be  banned  on 
Florida beaches, but the counterfeit $1 bills, with George  Wash-
ington  and the pyramid replaced by closeups of  impossible  oral 
sexual acts was a compelling gift.  They were so well made,  that 
without  a close inspection, the pornographic money could  easily 
find itself in the till at a church bake sale.

There  was  a message waiting for Scott when he  arrived  at  the 
Eureka!    It was from Tyrone and marked urgent.  New York was  6 
hours  behind,  so hopefully Ty was at home.   Scott  dialed  USA 
Connect,  the  service that allows travelers to get  to  an  AT&T 
operator rather than fight the local phone system.

"Make it good."  Tyrone answered his home phone.

"Hey, guy.  You rang?"  Scott said cheerily.  

"Shit,  it's about time.  Where the hell have you been?"   Tyrone 
whispered  as  loud as he could.  It was obvious he  didn't  want 
anyone  on  his end hearing.  "You can thank your  secretary  for 
telling me where you were staying."  Tyrone spoke quickly.

"I'll give her a raise," lied Scott. He didn't have a  secretary.  
The paper used a pool for all the reporters.  "What's the panic?"

"Then  you  don't know."  Tyrone caught himself. "Of  course  you 
didn't hear, how could you?"

"How could I hear what?"

"The shit has done hit the fan," Tyrone said drawling his  words.  
"Two  more  EMP-T bombs.  The Atlanta regional IRS office  and  a 
payroll  service in New Jersey.  A quarter million  folks  aren't 
getting paid tomorrow.  And I'll tell you, these folks is  mighty 
pissed off."

"Christ," Scott said, mentally chastising himself for not  having 
been where the action was. 

What lousy timing.

"So  dig  this.   Did you know that the Senate  was  having  open 
subcommittee hearings on Privacy and Technology Protection?"

"No."

"Neither do a lot of people.  It's been a completely  underplayed 
and underpromoted effort.  Until yesterday that is.  Now the eyes 
of millions are watching. Starting tomorrow."

"Tomorrow?" Scott yelled across the Atlantic. "That's the eighth. 
Congress doesn't usually convene until late January . . ."

"Used  to," Ty said.  "The Constitution says that Congress  shall 
meet  on January third, after the holidays.  Since the  Gulf  War 
Congress  has  returned in the first week.  'Bout time  they  did 
something for their paychecks."

"Damn," Scott thought out loud. 

"I knew that would excite you," Tyrone said sarcastically.   "And 
there's more.  Congressman Rickfield, you know who he is?"  asked 
Tyrone.

"Yeah, sure.  Long timer on the Hill.  Got as many enemies as  he 
does  friends.   Wields an immense amount of  power,"  Scott  re-
called.

"Right, exactly.  And that little weasel is the chair."

"I guess you're not on his Christmas list," Scott observed.

"I  really  doubt it," Tyrone said. "But that's off  the  record.  
He's  been  a Southern racist from day one, a  real  Hoover  man.  
During the riots, in the early '60's, he was not exactly a propo-
nent of civil rights.  In fact that slime ball made Wallace  look 
like Martin Luther King."  Tyrone sounded bitter and derisive  in 
his  description  of Rickfield.  "He has no  concept  what  civil 
rights  are.  He makes it a black white issue instead of  one  of 
constitutional  law.   Stupid bigots are the  worst  kind."   The 
derision in Ty's voice was unmistakable.  

"Sounds like you're a big fan."

"I'll  be  a  fan when he hangs high.  Besides  my  personal  and 
racial beliefs about Rickfield, he really is a low life.  He, and 
a  few of his cronies are one on the biggest threats to  personal 
freedom  the  country faces.  He thinks that the Bill  of  Rights 
should be edited from time to time and now's the time.  He scares 
me.  Especially since there's more like him."

It  was eminently clear that Tyrone Duncan had no place  in  this 
life for Merrill Rickfield.

"I know enough about him to dislike him, but on a crowded  subway 
he'd just be another ugly face.  Excuse my ignorance . . ."  Then 
it hit him.  Rickfield.  His name had been in those papers he had 
received  so long ago.  What had he done, or what was he  accused 
of doing?  Damn, damn, what is it?  There were so many.  Yes,  it 
was Rickfield, but what was the tie-in?

"I think you should be there, at the hearings," Tyrone suggested.

"Tomorrow?   Are  you out of your mind?  No  way,"  Scott  loudly 
protested.  "I'm 3000 miles and 8 hours away and it's the  middle 
of the night here,"  Scott bitched and moaned.  "Besides, I  only 
have  to  work  one  more  day and then  I  get  the  weekend  to 
myself . . . aw, shit."

Tyrone ignored Scott's infantile objections.  He attributed  them 
to  jet lag and an understandable urge to stay in Sin City for  a 
couple  more  days.  "Hollister and Adams will be  there,  and  a 
whole bunch of white shirts in black hats, and Troubleaux . . ."

"Troubleaux did you say?"

"Yeah, that's what it says here . . ."

"If he's there, then it becomes my concern, too."

"Good,  glad you thought of it," joked Tyrone.  "If you catch  an 
early  flight,  you  could be in D.C. by noon."   He  was  right, 
thought  Scott.  The time difference works in your favor in  that 
direction.

"You  know,"  said Scott, "with what I've found out  here,  today 
alone, maybe. "Jeeeeeesus," Scott said cringing in indecision.  

"Hey!  Get  your ass back here, boy. Pronto."  Tyrone's  friendly 
authority was persuasive.  "You know you don't have any  choice."  
The guilt trip.

"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

Scott  called  his office and asked for Doug.  He got  the  voice 
mail  instead,  and debated about calling him at  home.  Nah,  He 
thought,  I'll  just  leave a message.  This way  I'll  just  get 
yelled at once. 

"Hi, Doug? Scott here.  Change in plans.  Heard about EMP-T.  I'm 
headed  to Washington tomorrow.  The story here is better than  I 
thought  and dovetails right into why I'm coming back  early.   I 
expect  to be in D.C. until next Tuesday, maybe  Wednesday.  I'll 
call when I have a place. Oh, yeah, I learned a limerick here you 
might  like.  The Spook says the kids around here say it all  the 
time.   'Mary  had a little lamb, its fleece was white  as  snow.  
And  everywhere  that  Mary went, the lamb was sure  to  go.   It 
followed  her to school one day and a big black dog  fucked  it.'  
That's Amsterdam.  Bye."

                              Chapter 20

     Friday, January 8
     Washington, D.C.

The New Senate Office Building is a moderately impressive  struc-
ture  on  the edge of one of the worst  sections  of  Washington.  
Visitors  find it a perpetual paradox that the power seat of  the 
Western  World  is located within a virtual shooting  gallery  of 
drugs  and weapons.  Scott arrived at the NSOB near the  capitol, 
just before lunchtime.  His press identification got him  instant 
access  to  the hearing room and into  the  privileged  locations 
where  the media congregated.  The hearings were in progress  and 
as solemn as he remembered other hearings broadcast on late night 
C-SPAN.

He caught the last words of wisdom from a government employee who 
worked for NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy.   The agency was formerly known as NBS, National  Bureau  of 
Standards, and no one could adequately explain the change.

The  NIST employee droned on about how seriously the  government, 
and more specifically, his agency cared about privacy and  infor-
mation  security, and that ". . .the government was doing all  it 
could  to provide the requisite amount of  security  commensurate 
with  the  perceived risk of disclosure and  sensitivity  of  the 
information  in  question."  Scott ran into a  couple  of  fellow 
reporters  who told him he was lucky to show up late.  All  morn-
ing, the government paraded witnesses to read prepared statements 
about how they were protecting the interests of the Government. 

It was an intensive lobbying effort, they told Scott, to shore up 
whatever  attacks might be made on the  government's  inefficient 
bungling in distinction to its efficient bungling.  To a man, the 
witnesses  assured the Senate committee that they were  committed 
to guaranteeing privacy of information and unconvincingly  assur-
ing  them that only appropriate authorized people have access  to 
sensitive and classified data.  

Seven  sequential propagandized statements went  unchallenged  by 
the  three senior committee members throughout the  morning,  and 
Senator  Rickfield went out of his way to thank the speakers  for 
their  time, adding that he was personally convinced the  Govern-
ment  was indeed doing more than necessary to obviate  such  con-
cerns.

The  underadvertised Senate Select Sub Committee on  Privacy  and 
Technology  Protection  convened in Hearing Room 3 on the  second 
floor  of the NSOB.  About 400 could be accommodated in the  huge 
light wood paneled room on both the main floor and in the balcony 
that wrapped around half of the room.  The starkness of the  room 
was emphasized by the glare of arc and fluorescent lighting.

Scott  found an empty seat on a wooden bench directly behind  the 
tables from which the witnesses would speak to the raised  wooden 
dais.  He noticed that the attendance was extraordinarily low; by 
both the public and the press.  Probably due to the total lack of 
exposure.

As  the session broke for lunch, Scott asked why the TV  cameras?  
He  thought  this hearing was a deep dark secret.   A  couple  of 
fellow journalists agreed, and the only reason they had found out 
about the Rickfield hearings was because the CNN producer  called 
them asking if they knew anything about them.  Apparently,  Scott 
was told, CNN received an anonymous call, urging them to be  part 
of  a  blockbuster  announcement.  When  CNN  called  Rickfield's 
office,  his  staffers told CNN that there was no big  deal,  and 
that they shouldn't waste their time.  In the news business, that 
kind  of  statement from a Congressional power broker is  a  sure 
sign that it is worth being there.  Just in case. So CNN assigned 
a novice producer and a small crew to the first day of the  hear-
ings.  As promised, the morning session was an exercise in termi-
nal boredom. 

The afternoon session was to begin at 1:30, but Senator Rickfield 
was  nowhere  to be found, so the Assistant  Chairperson  of  the 
committee, Junior Senator Nancy Deere assumed control.  She was a 
44  year  old grandmother of two from New England who  had  never 
considered  entering  politics.  Nancy Deere was  the  consummate 
wife,  supporter and stalwart of her husband Morgan Deere, an  up 
and  coming  national politician who had the  unique  mixture  of 
honesty,  appeal  and potential. She had spent full time  on  the 
campaign trail with Morgan as he attempted to make the transition 
from  state  politics to Washington.  Morgan  Deere  was  heavily 
favored  to  win after the three term incumbent was named  a  co-
conspirator  in the rigging of a Defense contract.   Despite  the 
pending  indictments, the race continued with constant  pleadings 
by  the  incumbent that the trumped up charges would  shortly  be 
dismissed.  In the first week after the Grand Jury was  convened, 
the  voter  polls  indicated that Deere led with  a  70%  support 
factor.

Then  came  the accident.  On his way home from  a  fund  raising 
dinner,  Morgan Deere's limousine was run off an icy winter  road 
by a drunk driver.  Deere's resulting injuries made it impossible 
for  him to continue the campaign or even be sure that  he  would 
ever be able to regain enough strength to withstand the brutality 
of Washington politics.

Within  days of the accident, Deere's campaign manager  announced 
that  Nancy  Deere would replace her husband.   Due  to  Morgan's 
local  popularity, and the fact that the state was so small  that 
everyone  knew everyone else's business, and that  the  incumbent 
was  going  to jail, and that the elections were  less  than  two 
weeks away, there was barely a spike in the projections.  No  one 
seemed  to care that Nancy Deere had no experience  in  politics; 
they just liked her.

What remained of the campaign was run on her part with impeccable 
style.   Unlike her opponent who spent vast sums to besmirch  her 
on  television,  Nancy's campaign was largely waged on  news  and 
national  talk shows.  Her husband was popular, as was  she,  and 
the general interest in her as a woman outweighed the interest in 
her  politics.  The state's constituency overwhelmingly  endorsed 
her  with  their votes and Senator Nancy Deere, one  of  the  few 
woman ever to reach that level as an elected official, was on her 
way to Washington.

Nancy  Deere  found  that many of  the  professional  politicians 
preferred to ignore her; they were convinced she was bound to  be 
a one termer once the GOP got someone to run against her.  Others 
found  her  to  be a genuine pain in the butt.  Not  due  to  her 
naivete, far from that, she adeptly acclimated to the culture and 
the system.  Rather, she was a woman and she broke the rules. She 
said what she felt; she echoed the sentiments of her constituency 
which  were  largely unpopular politically.  Nancy  Deere  didn't 
care  what official Washington thought; her state was behind  her 
with  an almost unanimous approval and it was her sworn  duty  to 
represent them honestly and without compromise.  She had  nothing 
to lose by being herself.  After  more than a year in Washington, 
she  learned how the massive Washington machinery functioned  and 
why it crawled with a hurry up and wait engine. 

In Rickfield's absence, at 1:40 P.M., Senator Nancy Deere  called 
the  session to order.  Her administrative demeanor gave  no  one 
pause  to question her authority.  Even the other  sole  Congres-
sional  representative  on  the  sub-committee  fell  into  step.   
While  Senator Stanley Paglusi technically had seniority, he  sat 
on  the  committee at Rickfield's request and  held  no  specific 
interest  in  the  subject matter they  were  investigating.   He 
accepted  the  seat to mollify Rickfield and to add  to  his  own 
political resume.

"Come  to  order,  please," she announced over  the  ample  sound 
system.   The  voluminous hearing room reacted  promptly  to  the 
authoritative  command that issued forth from the  petite  auburn 
haired  Nancy Deere who would have been just as comfortable  auc-
tioning donated goods at her church.  She noticed that unlike the 
morning session, the afternoon session was packed. The press pool 
was  nearly full and several people were forced to  stand.   What 
had changed, she asked herself.

After  the  procedural  formalities  were  completed,  she  again 
thanked those who had spoken to the committee in the morning, and 
then  promised an equally informative afternoon.  Nancy,  as  she 
liked to be called on all but the most formal of occasions intro-
duced the committee's first afternoon witness.

"Our  next speaker is Ted Hammacher, a recognized expert  on  the 
subject  of computer and information security.  During  17  years 
with the Government, Mr. Hammacher worked with the Defense Inves-
tigatory  Agency and the National Security Agency as a DoD  liai-
son.   He is currently a security consultant to industry and  the 
government  and  is  the author of hundreds of  articles  on  the 
subject."   As  was required, Nancy  Deere  outlined  Hammacher's 
qualifications  as  an expert, and then invited him to  give  his 
opening statement. 

The  television in Rickfield's office was tuned to  C-SPAN  which 
was broadcasting the hearings as he spoke into the phone.

"Only  a  couple more and then I'm off to spend my  days  in  the 
company  of  luscious  maidens on the island of  my  choice,"  he 
bragged  into  the phone.  The Senator listened intently  to  the 
response.   "Yes, I am aware of that, but it doesn't  change  the 
fact  that I'm calling it quits.  I cannot, I will not,  continue 
this  charade."  He listened quietly for several  minutes  before 
interjecting.

"Listen,  General,  we've both made enough money to  keep  us  in 
style  for the rest of our lives, and I will not jeopardize  that 
for anything.  Got it?"  Again he listened.  "I don't know  about 
you, but I do not relish the idea of doing ten to twenty  regard-
less of how much of a country club the prison is.  It is still  a 
prison."  He listened further.

"That's  it, I've had it!  Don't make me use that file to  impli-
cate you, the guys over at State and our Import . . .hey!"  Rick-
field turned to Ken Boyers.  "Who started the afternoon session?"  
He pointed at the TV.

"It looks like Senator Deere," Ken said.

"Deere? Where does that goddamned bitch get off . . ?"  He remem-
bered the phone.  "General?  I have to go, I've got a suffragette 
usurping a little power, and I have to put her back in her place. 
You understand.  But, on that other matter, I'm out. Done.  Fini-
to.   Do what you want, but keep me the fuck out of  it."   Rick-
field hung up abruptly and stared at the broadcast.  "Some house-
broken  homemaker is not going to make me look bad.  Goddamn  it, 
Ken," Rickfield said as he stood up quickly.  "Let's get back out 
there."

"Thank  you, Senator Deere, and committee members.  I am  honored 
to have a chance to speak to you here today.  As a preface to  my 
remarks,  I  think that a brief history of security  and  privacy 
from a government perspective may be in order. One of the reasons 
we are here today is due to a succession of events that since the 
introduction  of the computer have shaped an ad hoc anarchism,  a 
laissez-faire attitude toward privacy and security.  Rather  than 
a comprehensive national policy, despite the valiant efforts of a 
few  able Congressmen, the United States of America  has  allowed 
itself to be lulled into technical complacency and  indifference.  
Therefore,  I  will,  if the committee agrees,  provide  a  brief 
chronological record."

"I  for one would be most interested," said Senator  Deere.   "It 
appeared  that  this morning our speakers assumed  we  were  more 
knowledgeable  that  we are.   Any clarifications  will  be  most 
welcome."   The crowd agreed silently.  Much of the  history  was 
cloaked in secrecy. 

The  distinguished  Ted  Hammacher was  an  accomplished  orator, 
utilizing the best that Washington diplomatic-speak could muster.  
At  50  years old, his short cropped white hair capped  a  proper 
military bearing even though he had maintained a civilian  status 
throughout   his   Pentagon  associations.   "Thank   you   madam 
chairman."   He  glanced down at the well  organized  folder  and 
turned a page.

"Concerns  of privacy can be traced back thousands of years  with 
perhaps  the Egyptian pyramids as the first classic example of  a 
brute  force  approach towards privacy.  The first  recorded  at-
tempts  at disguising the contents of a written message  were  in 
Roman  times when Julius Caesar encoded messages to his  generals 
in the field.  The Romans used a simple substitution cipher where 
one  letter  in the alphabet is used in place  of  another.   The 
cryptograms  found in the Sunday paper use the  same  techniques.  
Any  method by which a the contents of a message is scrambled  is 
known as encryption."

The  CNN producer maintained the sole camera shot and his  atten-
tion  on Ted Hammacher.  He missed Senator Rickfield and his  aid 
reappear  on the dais.  Rickfield's eyes penetrated  Nancy  Deere 
who imperceptibly acknowledged his return. "You should not  over-
step  your bounds," Rickfield leaned over and said to her.   "You 
have  five years to go. Stunts like this will not make your  time 
any easier."

"Senator,"  she  said to Rickfield as Hammacher spoke.  "You  are 
obviously not familiar with the procedures of Senate panel proto-
col.  I was merely trying to assist the progress of the  hearings 
in  your absence, I assure you."   Her coolness infuriated  Rick-
field.

"Well,  then,  thank you," he sneered. "But, now, I am  back.   I 
will  appreciate no further procedural interference."  He sat  up 
brusquely  indicating that his was the last word on the  subject.  
Unaware  of the political sidebar in progress, Hammacher  contin-
ued.

"Ciphers  were  evolved over the centuries until they  reached  a 
temporary plateau during World War II.  The Germans used the most 
sophisticated message encoding or encryption device ever devised.  
Suitably  called the Enigma, their encryption scheme  was  nearly 
uncrackable  until  the Allies captured one of the  devices,  and 
then  under the leadership of Alan Turing, a method was found  to 
regularly decipher intercepted German High Command orders.   Many 
historians consider this effort as being instrumental in bringing 
about an end to the war.

"In  the years immediately following World War II, the only  per-
ceived  need  for secrecy was by the military  and  the  emerging 
intelligence  services,  namely the OSS as it became  the  modern 
CIA, the British MI-5 and MI-6 and of course our opponents on the 
other side.  In an effort to maintain a technological  leadership 
position, the National Security Agency funded various projects to 
develop encryption schemes that would adequately protect  govern-
ment information and communications for the foreseeable future.  

"The first such requests were issued in 1972 but it wasn't  until 
1974  that the National Bureau of Standards accepted an IBM  pro-
posal   for  an encryption process known as  Lucifer.   With  the 
assistance  of the NSA who is responsible for  cryptography,  the 
Data Encryption Standard was approved in November of 1976.  There 
was an accompanying furor over the DES, some saying that the  NSA 
intentionally weakened it to insure that they could still decrypt 
any messages using the approved algorithm.

"In 1982  a financial group, FIMAS endorsed a DES based method to 
authenticate  Electronic  Funds  Transfer, or  EFT.   Banks  move 
upwards  of a trillion dollars daily, and in an effort to  insure 
that all monies are moved accurately and to their intended desti-
nations,  the  technique  of Message  Authentication  Coding  was 
introduced.   For still unknown reasons it was decided  that  en-
crypting the contents of the messages, or transfers, was unneces-
sary.    Thus, financial transactions are still carried out  with 
no protection from eavesdropping."

"Excuse me, Mr. Hammacher, I want to understand this," interrupt-
ed Senator Deere.  "Are you saying that, since 1976, we have  had 
the ability to camouflage the nation's financial networks, yet as 
of today, they are still unprotected?"  Rickfield looked over  at 
Nancy in disgust but the single camera missed it.

"Yes, ma'am, that's exactly the case," replied Hammacher.

"What does that mean to us? The Government? Or the average  citi-
zen?"

"In  my  opinion it borders on insanity.  It means that  for  the 
price  of a bit of electronic equipment, anyone can tap into  the 
details  of the financial dealings of banks, the  government  and 
every citizen in this country."

Senator Deere visibly gulped.  "Thank you, please continue."

"In  1984,  President Reagan signed  National  Security  Decision 
Directive 145.  NSDD-145 established that defense contractors and 
other organizations that handle sensitive or classified  informa-
tion  must adhere to certain security and privacy guidelines.   A 
number  of  advisory groups were established, and  to  a  minimal 
extent,  the  recommendations have been implemented, but  I  must 
emphasize, to a minimal extent."

"Can you be a little more specific, Mr. Hammacher?" Asked Senator 
Deere.

"No ma'am, I can't.  A great deal of these efforts are classified 
and  by divulging who is not currently in compliance would  be  a 
security  violation in itself.  It would be fair to say,  though, 
that the majority of those organizations targeted for  additional 
security  measures fall far short of the government's  intentions  
and desires.  I am sorry I cannot be more specific."

"I understand completely.  Once again," Nancy said to  Hammacher, 
"I am sorry to interrupt."

"Not  at all, Senator."  Hammacher sipped from his  water  glass.  
"As you can see, the interest in security was primarily from  the 
government,  and  more specifically the  defense  community.   In 
1981, the Department of Defense chartered the DoD Computer  Secu-
rity Center which has since become the National Computer Security 
Center  operating  under the auspices of  the  National  Security 
Agency.  In 1983 they published a series of guidelines to be used 
in  the creation or evaluation of computer security.   Officially 
titled  the Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria, it  is 
popularly  known  as  the Orange Book.   It has  had  some  minor 
updates  since then, but by and large it is an outdated  document 
designed for older computer architectures.

"The  point to be made here is that while the government  had  an 
ostensible interest and concern about the security of  computers, 
especially  those  under their control, there  was  virtually  no 
overt significance placed upon the security of private industry's 
computers.   Worse yet, it was not until 1987 that  any  proposed 
criteria  were  developed for networked computers.   So,  as  the 
world  tied itself together with millions of computers  and  net-
works,  the  Government was not concerned enough to  address  the 
issue.  Even today, there are no secure network criteria that are 
universally accepted."

"Mr. Hammacher."  Senator Rickfield spoke up for the first  time.  
"You  appear  to have a most demeaning tone with respect  to  the 
United  States Government's ability to manage itself.  I for  one 
remain  unconvinced  that  we are as  derelict  as  you  suggest.  
Therefore, I would ask that you stick to the subject at hand, the 
facts, and leave your personal opinions at home."

Nancy  Deere as well as much of the audience listened in  awe  as 
Rickfield  slashed  out at Hammacher who was in  the  process  of 
building  an argument.  Common courtesy demanded that he be  per-
mitted  to  finish his statement, even if  his  conclusions  were 
unpopular or erroneous.

Hammacher  did not seem fazed.  "Sir, I am recounting the  facts, 
and  only the facts.  My personal opinions would only be  further 
damning,  so I agree, that I will refrain."  He turned a page  in 
his notebook and continued.

"Several  laws were passed, most notably Public Law 100-235,  the 
Computer Security Act of 1987.  This weak law called for enhanced 
cooperation  between  the NSA and NIST in the  administration  of 
security for the sensitive but unclassified world of the  Govern-
ment  and the private sector.  Interestingly enough, in mid  1990 
it was announced, that after a protracted battle between the  two 
security agencies, the NCSC would shut down and merge its efforts 
with  its  giant super secret parent, the  NSA.   President  Bush 
signed  the  Directive effectively replacing  Reagan's  NSDD-145.  
Because  the  budgeting and appropriations for both NSA  and  the 
former  NCSC are classified, there is no way to accurately  gauge 
the effectiveness of this move.  It may still be some time before 
we understand the ramifications of the new Executive Order.

"To date every state has some kind of statute designed to  punish 
computer  crime,  but prosecutions that involve the  crossing  of 
state lines in the commission of a crime are far and few between.  
Only 1% of all computer criminals are prosecuted and less than 5% 
of those result in convictions.  In short, the United States  has 
done  little or nothing to forge an appropriate  defense  against 
computer  crime, despite the political gerrymandering and  agency 
shuffling  over the last decade.  That concludes my  opening  re-
marks."  Hammacher sat back in his chair and finished the  water.  
He  turned to his lawyer and whispered something  Scott  couldn't 
hear.

"Ah,  Mr. Hammacher, before you continue, I would like ask a  few 
questions.   Do  you mind?"  Senator Nancy Deere  was  being  her 
usual gracious self.

"Not at all, Senator."

"You  said earlier that the NSA endorsed a  cryptographic  system 
that they themselves could crack.  Could you elaborate?"  Senator 
Nancy Deere's ability to grasp an issue at the roots was uncanny.

"I'd  be pleased to.  First of all, it is only one  opinion  that 
the  NSA  can crack DES; it has never been proven  or  disproven.  
When  DES was first introduced some theoreticians felt  that  NSA 
had  compromised the original integrity of IBM's Lucifer  encryp-
tion project.  I am not qualified to comment either way, but  the 
reduction  of the key length, and the functional feedback  mecha-
nisms  were less stringent than the original.  If this  is  true, 
then  we  have to ask ourselves, why?  Why would the NSA  want  a 
weaker system?"

A  number of heads in the hearing room nodded in  agreement  with 
the question; others merely acknowledged that it was NSA  bashing 
time again.

Hammacher continued.  "There is one theory that suggests that the 
NSA,  as the largest eavesdropping operation in the world  wanted 
to  make  sure that they could still listen in on  messages  once 
they  have  been  encrypted.  The NSA has  neither  confirmed  or 
denied  these  reports.  If that is true, then we must  ask  our-
selves, if DES is so weak, why does the NSA have the ultimate say 
on export control.  The export of DES is restricted by the  Muni-
tions  Control, Department of State, and they rely upon  DoD  and 
the NSA for approval.

"The  export controls suggest that maybe NSA cannot decrypt  DES, 
and  there  is some evidence to support that.   For  example,  in 
1985, the Department of Treasury wanted to extend the  validation 
of  DES  for  use throughout the Treasury,  the  Federal  Reserve 
System  and member banks.  The NSA put a lot of political  muscle 
behind  an effort to have DES deaffirmed and replaced with  newer 
encryption  algorithms.   Treasury argued that they  had  already 
adapted DES, their constituents had spent millions on DES  equip-
ment  for EFT and it would be entirely too cumbersome and  expen-
sive  to  make a change now.  Besides, they asked,  what's  wrong 
with  DES?  They never got an answer to that question,  and  thus 
they  won  the battle and DES is still  the  approved  encryption 
methodology for banks.  It was never established whether DES  was 
too strong or too weak for NSA's taste.

"Later, in 1987, the NSA received an application for export of  a 
DES  based device that employed a technique called  infinite  en-
cryption. In response to the frenzy over the strength or weakness 
of  DES,  one  company took DES and folded it over  and  over  on 
itself using multiple keys.  The NSA had an internal  hemorrhage.  
They  forbade  this product from being exported from  the  United 
States in any form whatsoever.  Period.  It was an  extraordinary 
move on their part, and one that had built-in contradictions.  If 
DES  is  weak, then why not export it?  If it's too  strong,  why 
argue  with Treasury?  In any case, the multiple DES  issue  died 
down  until recently, when NSA, beaten at their own game  by  too 
much  secrecy,  developed a secret internal program to  create  a 
Multiple-DES encryption standard with a minimum of three  sequen-
tial iterations.

"Further  embarrassment was caused when an Israeli  mathematician 
found the 'trap door' built into DES by the NSA and how to decode 
messages  in seconds.  This quite clearly suggests that the  gov-
ernment  has been listening in on supposedly secret  and  private 
communications.

"Then  we  have to look at another event that  strongly  suggests 
that NSA has something to hide."

"Mr. Hammacher!" Shouted Senator Rickfield.  "I warned you  about 
that."

"I  see nothing wrong with his comments, Senator,"   Deere  said, 
careful to make sure that she was heard over the sound system.

"I  am the chairman of this committee, Ms. Deere, and I find  Mr. 
Hammacher's characterization of the NSA as unfitting this  forum.  
I  wish he would find other words or eliminate the thought  alto-
gether.  Mr. Hammacher, do you think you are capable of that?"

Hammacher seethed.  "Senator, I mean no disrespect to you or this 
committee.   However, I was asked to testify, and at my  own  ex-
pense I am providing as accurate information as possible. If  you 
happen to find anything I say not to your liking, I do apologize, 
but my only alternative is not to testify at all."

"We  accept  your withdrawal, Mr. Hammacher, thank you  for  your 
time."  A hushed silence covered the hearing room.  This was  not 
the  time to get into it with Rickfield, Nancy thought.   He  has 
sufficiently embarrassed himself and the media will take care  of 
the rest.  Why the hell is he acting this way?  He is known as  a 
hard ass, a real case, but his public image was unblemished.  Had 
the job passed him by?

A  stunned and incensed Hammacher gathered his belongings as  his 
lawyer  placated  him.  Scott overheard bits and pieces  as  they 
both  agreed that Rickfield was a flaming asshole.  A  couple  of 
reporters  hurriedly followed them out of the hearing room for  a 
one on one interview.  

"Is Dr. Sternman ready?"  Rickfield asked.  

A  bustle  of activity and a man spoke to the  dais  without  the 
assistance of a microphone.  "Yessir, I am."

Sternman was definitely the academic type, Scott noted.  A  crum-
pled  ill fitting brown suit covering a small hunched  body  that 
was  no more than 45 years old.  He held an old scratched  brief-
case and an armful of folders and envelopes.  Scott was  reminded 
of  the  studious high school student that jocks  enjoy  tripping 
with  their feet.  Dr. Sternman busied himself to straighten  the 
papers  that  fell onto the desk and his performance  received  a 
brief titter from the crowd.

"Ah,  yes, Mr. Chairman," Sternman said. "I'm ready now."   Rick-
field looked as bored as ever.

"Thank  you,  Dr. Sternman.  You are, I  understand,  a  computer 
virus expert?  Is that correct?"

"Yessir.  My doctoral thesis was on the subject and I have  spent 
several  years researching computer viruses, their  proliferation 
and propagation."  Rickfield groaned to himself.   Unintelligible 
mumbo jumbo.

"I  also understand that your comments will be brief as  we  have 
someone  else yet to hear from today."  It was as much a  command 
as a question.

"Yessir, it will be brief."

"Then,  please, enlighten us, what is a virus expert and what  do 
you do?"  Rickfield grinned menacingly at Dr. Les Sternman,  Pro-
fessor  of Applied Theoretical Mathematics, Massachusetts  Insti-
tute of Technology.

"I  believe  the committee has received an advance copy  of  some 
notes  I  made on the nature of computer viruses and  the  danger 
they represent?"  Rickfield hadn't read anything, so he looked at 
Boyers who also shrugged his shoulders.

"Yes,  Dr.  Sternman," Nancy Deere said,  "and we thank  you  for 
your  consideration."   Rickfield glared at her as  she  politely 
upstaged  him yet again.  "May I ask, though, that you provide  a 
brief  description of a computer virus for the benefit  of  those 
who have not read your presentation?"  She stuck it to  Rickfield 
again.

"I'd be happy to, madam Chairwoman," he said nonchalantly.  Rick-
field's neck turned red at the inadvertent sudden rise in Senator 
Deere's  stature. For the next several minutes Sternman  solemnly 
described what a virus was, how it worked and a history of  their 
attacks.  He told the committee about Worms, Trojan Horses,  Time 
Bombs,  Logic  Bombs,  Stealth Viruses, Crystal  Viruses  and  an 
assorted  family  of  similar  surreptitious  computer  programs.  
Despite  Sternman's sermonly manner, his audience found the  sub-
ject matter fascinating. 

"The  reason  you are here, Dr. Sternman, is to bring  us  up  to 
speed on computer viruses, which you have done with alacrity, and 
we  appreciate that."  Rickfield held seniority, but Nancy  Deere 
took charge due to her preparation.  "Now that we have an  under-
standing  of  the virus, can you give us an idea of the  type  of 
problems that they cause?"

"Ah, yes, but I need to say something here," Sternman said.

"Please, proceed," Rickfield said politely.

"When I first heard about replicating software, viruses, and this 
was  over 15 years ago, I, as many of my graduate  students  did, 
thought of them as a curious anomaly.  A benign subset of comput-
er  software  that  had no anticipated  applications.   We  spent 
months  working  with viruses, self cloning  software  and  built 
mathematical  models of their behavior which fit quite neatly  in 
the domain of conventional set theory.  Then an amazing discovery 
befell us.  We proved mathematically that there is absolutely  no 
effective way to protect against computer viruses in software."  

Enough  of the spectators had heard about viruses over  the  past 
few years to comprehend the purport of that one compelling state-
ment.   Even  Senator Rickfield joined Nancy and  the  others  in 
their awe.  No way to combat viruses?   Dr. Sternman had  dropped 
a bombshell on them.

"Dr. Sternman," said Senator Deere, "could you repeat that?

"Yes,  yes," Sternman replied, knowing the impact of  his  state-
ment.   "That  is correct.  A virus is a piece  of  software  and 
software is designed to do specific tasks in a hardware  environ-
ment.  All software uses basically the same techniques to do  its 
job.  Without all of the technicalities, if one piece of software 
can  do something, another piece of software can un-do it.   It's 
kind of a computer arms race.  

"I build a virus, and you build a program to protect against that 
one  virus.   It works.  But then I make a small  change  in  the 
virus  to attack or bypass your software, and Poof!  I  blow  you 
away.   Then you build a new piece of software to defend  against 
both  my first virus and my mutated virus and that works until  I 
build yet another.  This process can go on forever, and  frankly, 
it's just not worth the effort."  

"What is not worth the effort, Doctor?" Asked Nancy Deere.   "You 
paint a most bleak picture."

"I don't mean to at all, Senator."  Dr. Sternman smiled soothing-
ly  up at the committee and took off his round horn rim  glasses.  
"I  wasn't attempting to be melodramatic, however these  are  not 
opinions or guesses.  They are facts.  It is not worth the effort 
to fight computer viruses with software.  The virus builders will 
win because the Virus Busters are the ones playing catch-up."

"Virus Busters?"  Senator Rickfield mockingly said  conspicuously 
raising  his eyebrows.  His reaction elicited a wave of  laughter 
from the hall.

"Yessir,"  said  Dr.  Sternman  to  Rickfield.   "Virus  Busters.  
That's  a term to describe programmers who fight  viruses.   They 
mistakenly believe they can fight viruses with defensive software  
and  some  of them sell some incredibly poor programs.   In  many 
cases you're better off not using anything at all.

"You see, there is no way to write a program that can predict the 
potential  behavior of other software in such a way that it  will 
not interfere with normal computer operations.  So, the only  way 
to find a virus is to already know what it looks like, and go out 
looking  for  it.   There are several major  problems  with  this 
approach.   First of all, the virus has already struck  and  done 
some damage.  Two it has already infected other software and will 
continue  to spread.  Three, a program must be written to  defeat 
the  specific  virus usually using a unique  signature  for  each 
virus,  and the vaccine for the virus must be distributed to  the 
computer users.

"This  process can take from three to twelve months, and  by  the 
time the virus vaccine has been deployed, the very same virus has 
been changed, mutated, and the vaccine is useless against it.  So 
you  see,  the Virus Busters are really wasting their  time,  and 
worst  of all they are deceiving the public."  Dr. Sternman  com-
pleted what he had to say with surprising force.

"Doctor Sternman,"  Senator Rickfield said with disdain,  "all of 
your  theories  are well and good, and perhaps they work  in  the 
laboratory. But isn't it true, sir, that computer viruses are  an 
overblown issue that the media has sensationalized and that  they 
are nothing more than a minor inconvenience?"

"Not really, Senator.  The statistics don't support that  conclu-
sion,"  Dr. Sternman said with conviction.  "That is one  of  the 
worst myths."  Nancy Deere smiled to herself as the dorky college 
professor  handed  it  right to a United  States  Senator.   "The 
incidence of computer viruses has been on a logarithmic  increase 
for  the past several years.  If a human disease infected at  the 
same rate, we would declare a medical state of emergency."

"Doctor," implored Rickfield.  "Aren't you exaggerating . . .?"

"No  Senator, here are the facts.  There are currently over  5000  
known  computer  viruses and strains that  have  been  positively 
identified.   Almost five thousand, Senator."   The  good  Doctor 
was  a skilled debater, and Rickfield was being sucked in by  his 
attack  on  the  witness.  The figure  three  thousand  impressed 
everyone.   A few low whistles echoed through the large  chamber. 
Stupid move Merrill, though Nancy.  

"It  is estimated, sir, that at the current rate, there  will  be 
over  100,000 active viruses in five years,"  Dr. Sternman  dryly 
spoke  to  Rickfield, "that every single network  in  the  United 
States,  Canada and the United Kingdom is infected with at  least 
one computer virus.  That is the equivalent of having one  member 
of every family in the country being sick at all times.  That  is 
an epidemic, and one that will not go away. No sir, it will not."  
Sternman's  voice rose.  "It will not go away.  It will only  get 
worse."

"That  is a most apoplectic prophesy, Doctor.  I think that  many 
of  us would have trouble believing the doom and gloom  you  por-
tend."  Rickfield was sloughing off the Doctor, but Sternman  was 
here to tell a story, and he would finish.

"There  is more, Senator.  Recent reports show that over  75%  of 
the computers in the People's Republic of China are infected with 
deadly  and  destructive software.  Why?  The look on  your  face 
asks  the question.  Because, almost every piece of  software  in 
that  country  is bootleg, illegal copies  of  popular  programs.  
That  invites viruses.   Since vast quantities of computers  come 
from the Pacific Rim, many with prepackaged software, new comput-
er  equipment is a source of computer viruses that was once  con-
sidered safe.  Modem manufacturers have accidentally had  viruses 
on their communications software; several major domestic software 
manufacturers have had their shrink-wrapped software infected.  

"If you recall in 1989, NASA brought Virus Busters to Cape Kenne-
dy  and  Houston to thwart a particular virus that  threatened  a 
space launch.  A year later as everyone remembers, NASA computers 
were invaded forcing officials to abort a flight.  The attacks go 
on, and they inflict greater damage than is generally thought.

"Again, these are our best estimates, that over 90% of all  viral 
infections go unreported."

"Doctor, 90%?  Isn't that awfully high?"  Nancy asked.

"Definitely, yes, but imagine the price of speaking out.  I  have 
talked  to  hundreds of companies, major corporations,  that  are 
absolutely terrified of anyone knowing that their computers  have 
been  infected.   Or they have been the target  of  any  computer 
crime for that matter.  They feel that the public, their  custom-
ers,  maybe  even  their stockholders, might lose  faith  in  the 
company's ability to protect itself.  So?  Most viral attacks  go 
unreported.  

"It's akin to computer rape."  Dr. Sternman had a way with  words 
to  keep his audience attentive.  Years of lecturing to  sleeping 
freshman  had  taught him a few tricks.   "A  computer  virus  is 
uninvited,  it invades the system, and then has its way with  it.  
If that's not rape, I don't know what is."

"Your  parallels are most vivid," said a grimacing  Nancy  Deere.  
"Let's leave that thought for now, and maybe you can explain  the 
type  of damage that a virus can do.  It sounds to me like  there 
are  thousands of new diseases out there, and every one needs  to 
be  isolated, diagnosed and then cured.  That appears to me to  a 
formidable challenge."

"I  could  not  have put it better, Senator.   You  grasp  things 
quickly."   Sternman  was  genuinely  complimenting  Nancy.  "The 
similarities  to the medical field cannot go unnoticed if we  are 
to deal with the problem rationally and effectively.  And like  a 
disease,  we need to predict the effects of the infection.   What 
we have found in that area is as frightening.

"The  first generation of viruses were simple in their  approach.  
The designers correctly assumed that no one was looking for them, 
and they could enter systems without any deterrence.  They  erase 
files, scramble data, re-format hard drives . . .make the comput-
er data useless.  

"Then  the  second  generation of viruses  came  along  with  the 
nom-de-guerre stealth.  These viruses hid themselves more  elabo-
rately  to avoid detection and had a built  in  self-preservation 
instinct.   If  the virus thinks it's being probed, it  self  de-
structs or hides itself even further.  

"In  addition,  second generation viruses learned how  to  become 
targeted.   Some  viruses  have been designed to  only  attack  a 
competitor's product and nothing else."

"Is that possible?" Asked Nancy Deere.

"It's been done many times.  Some software bugs in popular  soft-
ware  are the result of viral infections, others may  be  genuine 
bugs.  Imagine  a virus who sole purpose is to attack  Lotus  123 
spreadsheets.   The  virus is designed  to  create  computational 
errors in the program's spreadsheets.  The user then thinks  that 
Lotus is to blame and so he buys another product.  Yes, ma'am, it 
is  possible, and occurs every day of the week.  Keeping up  with 
it is the trick.

"Other viruses attack on Friday the 13th. only, some attack  only 
at a specified time . . .the damage to be done is only limited by 
imagination  of the programmers.  Third generation  viruses  were 
even  more  sophisticated.  They were designed to do  damage  not 
only to the data, but to the computer hardware itself.  Some were 
designed  to  overload communications ports  with  tight  logical 
loops.  Others were designed to destroy the hard disk by directly 
overdriving  the disk or would cause amonitor  to  self-destruct.  
There is no limit to the possibilities.

"You  sound as though you hold their skills in high regard,  Doc-
tor."  Rickfield continued to make snide remarks whenever  possi-
ble.

"Yessir, I do.  Many of them have extraordinary skills, that are 
unfortunately   misguided.   They  are  a  new  breed  of   bored 
criminal."

"You  mentioned earlier Doctor, that there were over  5000  known 
viruses.   How fast is the epidemic, as you put  it,  spreading?"  
Senator Nancy Deere asked while making prolific notes throughout.

"For  all  intents and purposes Senator, they  spread  unchecked.  
There is a certain amount of awareness of the problem, but it  is 
only  superficial.  The current viral defenses include  signature 
identification, cyclic redundancy checks and intercept  verifica-
tion,  but the new viruses can combat those as a matter of  rule.  
If  the current rate of viral infection continues, it will  be  a 
safe  bet that nearly every computer in the country will  be  in-
fected ten times over within three years."

Dr. Arnold Sternman spent the next half hour answering insightful 
questions  from  Nancy Deere, and even Puglasi  became  concerned 
enough  to  ask  a few.  Rickfield continued  with  his  visceral 
comments to the constant amazement of the gallery and spectators.  
Scott  could only imagine the raking Rickfield would  receive  in 
the  press,  but  being Friday, the  effects  will  be  lessened.  
Besides, it seemed as if Rickfield just didn't give a damn.

Rickfield  dismissed and perfunctorily thanked Dr.  Sternman.  He 
prepared for the next speaker, but Senator Deere leaned over  and 
asked  him for a five minute conclave.  He was openly  reluctant, 
but  as she raised her voice, he conceded.  In a  private  office 
off to the side, Nancy Deere came unglued.

"What  kind  of stunt are you pulling out there,  Senator?"   She 
demanded  as she paced the room.  "I thought this was a  hearing, 
not a lynching."

Rickfield slouched in a plush  leather chair and appeared  uncon-
cerned.   "I am indeed sorry," he said with the pronounced  drawl 
of a Southern country gentleman, "that the young Senatoress finds 
cross examination unpleasant.  Perhaps if we treated this like  a 
neighborhood gossip session, it might be easier."    

"Now one damned minute," she yelled while pointing a finger right 
at Rickfield.  "That was not cross-examination; it was harassment 
and I for one am embarrassed for you.  And two, do not, I repeat, 
do  not,  ever  patronize me.  I am not one of  your  cheap  call 
girls."    She could not have knocked Rickfield over  any  harder 
with a sledgehammer.

"You bitch!"  Rickfield rose to confront her standing nine inches 
taller.   "You stupid bitch.  You have no idea what's  at  stake.  
None.  It's bigger than you.  At this rate I can assure you,  you 
will never have an ear in Washington.  Never.  You will be  deaf, 
dumb and blind in this town.  I have been on this Hill for thirty 
years  and  paid my dues and I will not have a middle  aged  June 
Cleaver undermine a lifetime of work just because she smells  her 
first cause."

Undaunted, Nancy stood her ground.  "I don't know what you're  up 
to  Senator, but I do know that you're sand bagging  these  hear-
ings.   I've  raised four kids and half a neighborhood,  plus  my 
husband talked in his sleep.  I learned a lot about  politicians, 
and  I  know sand bagging when I see it.  Now, if you  got  stuck 
with  these hearings and think they're a crock, that's  fine.   I 
hear it happens to everyone.  But, I see them as important and  I 
don't want you to interfere."

"You are in no position to ask for anything."  

"I'm not asking.  I'm telling."  Where did she get the  gumption, 
she  asked  herself.   Then it occurred to her;<MI>   I'm  not  a 
politician,  I  want to see things get fixed.<D>   "I  will  take 
issue with you, take you on publicly, if necessary.  I was Presi-
dent of the PTA for 8 years.  I am fluent in dealing with bitches 
of every size and shape.  You're just a bastard."

                    Chapter 21

     Friday, January 8
     Washington, D.C.

As the hour is late, I am tempted to call a recess until tomorrow 
morning,"   Senator Merrill Rickfield said congenially  from  the 
center  seat  of the hearing room dais.  His blow up  with  Nancy 
left him in a rage, but he ably disguised the anger by  replacing 
it with overcompensated manners.

"However," he continued, "I understand that we scheduled  someone 
to  speak  to us who has to catch a plane  back  to  California?"  
Rickfield  quickly glanced about the formal dais to espy  someone 
who could help him fill in the details.  Ken Boyers was engrossed 
in  conversation and had to be prodded to respond.  "Ken,"  Rick-
field whispered while covering the microphone with his hand.   He 
leaned over and behind his seat.  "Is that right, this True  Blue 
guy flew in for the day and he's out tonight?" 

Ken  nodded. "Yes, it was the only way we could get him."

"What makes him so bloody important?"  Rickfield acted edgy.

"He's one of the software industry's leading spokesman.  He  owns 
dGraph,"   Ken  said, making it sound like he was in on a private 
joke.

"So  fucking what?  What's he doing here?"   Rickfield  demanded.  
Keeping it to a whisper was hard. 

"Industry  perspective.  We need to hear from all possible  view-
points in order to . . ."  Ken  explained.

"Oh, all right.  Whatever.  If this  goes past five, have someone 
call my wife and tell her I'll see her tomorrow."  Rickfield  sat 
back and smiled a politician-hiding-something smile.

"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, a little scheduling  confusion.  
I guess there's a first time for anything."  Rickfield's  chuckle 
told  those-in-the-know that it was time to laugh now.  If  Rick-
field saw someone not laughing at one of his arthritic jokes,  he 
would remember.   Might cost a future favor, so it was simpler to 
laugh.   The mild titter throughout the hall that  followed  gave 
Rickfield the few seconds he needed to organize himself.

"Yes,  yes.  Page 239.  Everyone there?"  Rickfield  scanned  the 
other  committee members and aides flipping pages frantically  to 
find the proper place.

"We now have the pleasure of hearing from Pierre, now correct  me 
if I say this wrong, Trewww-Blow?"  Rickfield looked up over  his 
glasses  to  see Pierre seated at the hearing  table.   "Is  that 
right?"  Scott had been able to keep his privileged location  for 
the busier afternoon session by occupying several seats with  his 
bags  and  coat.  He figured correctly that he would be  able  to 
keep  at least one as the room filled with more people  than  had 
been there for the morning session.

"Troubleaux, yes Senator. Very good."  Pierre had turned on  110% 
charm.   Cameras  from the now busy press pool in  front  of  the 
hearing  tables strobe-lit the room until every photographer  had 
his  first  quota of shots.  Troubleaux was  still  the  computer 
industry's  Golden Boy; he could do no wrong. Watching the  reac-
tion  to  Pierre's  mere presence,  Senator  Rickfield  instantly 
realized  that  True Blue here was a public  relations  pro,  and 
could be hard to control.  What was he gonna say anyway?   Indus-
try perspective my ass.  This hearing was as good as over  before 
it  started  until  the television people  showed  up,  Rickfield 
thought to himself with disgust.

"Mr. Trew-Blow flew in extra special for this today,"   Rickfield 
orated.  "And I'm sure we are all anxious to hear what he has  to 
say."   His Southern twang rang of boredom.  Scott, who was  sit-
ting  not  6  feet from where Pierre and  the  others  testified, 
overheard Troubleaux's attorney whisper, "sarcastic bastard."  

Rickfield  continued. "He is here to give us an overview  of  the 
problems that software manufacturers face.  So, unless anyone has 
any  comments  before Mr. Trew-Blow, I will ask him to  read  his 
opening statement."  

"I  do,  Mr. Chairman,"  Senator Nancy Deere said.  She  said  it 
with enough oomph to come across more dynamic on the sound system 
than  did  Rickfield.   Political  upstaging.   Rickfield  looked 
annoyed.  He had had enough of her today. One thing after  anoth-
er, and all he wanted was to get through the hearings as fast  as 
possible, make a "Take No Action" recommendation to the Committee 
and retire after election day.  Mrs.  Deere was making that  goal 
increasingly difficult to reach.

"I  recognize the Junior Senator."  He said the word 'Junior'  as 
if  it was scrawled on a men's room wall.  His point was lost  on 
nobody,  and privately, most would agree that it was a  tasteless 
tactic.

"Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman," Senator Nancy  Deere  said  poising 
herself.   "I, too,  feel indeed grateful, and honored,  to  have 
Mr. Troubleaux here today.  His accomplishments over the last few 
years,  legendary in some circles I understand, have been  in  no 
way inconsequential to the way that America does business. By  no 
means  do I wish  to embarrass Mr. Troubleaux, and I do  hope  he 
will  forgive me."  Pierre gave Nancy a forgiving smile when  she 
glanced  at  him.   "However, I do feel it  incumbent  upon  this 
committee to enter into the record the significant  contributions 
he  has  made to the computer industry.  If there are  no  objec-
tions, I have prepared a short biography."  No one objected.

"Mr.  Troubleaux, a native  Frenchman, came to the United  States 
at  age  12 to attend Julliard School of  Music  on  scholarship.  
Since  founding dGraph, Inc. with the late Max Jones, dGraph  and 
Mr. Troubleaux have received constant accolades from the business 
community,  the software industry and Wall Street."   It  sounded 
more  to Scott that she was reading past achievements before  she 
handed out a Grammy. 

"Entrepreneur  of  the Year, 1984, 1985,  1986,  1988,  Cupertino 
Chamber  of Commerce.  Entrepreneur Year of the Year,  California 
State  Trade  Association, 1987.  Technical  Achievement  of  the 
Year, IEEE, 1988 . . ."

Senator Deere read on about Pierre the Magnificent and the  house 
that dGraph built.  If this was an election for sainthood, Pierre 
would  be a shoo-in.  But considering the beating that  Rickfield 
had  inflicted  on a couple of earlier speakers, it  looked  like 
Nancy was trying to bolster Pierre for the upcoming onslaught.

".  . .and he has just been appointed to the President's  Council 
on  Competitive Excellence."  She closed her folder.  "With  that 
number  of  awards  and credentials, I dare say I  expect  to  be 
inundated with insights.  Thank you Mr. Chairman."

"And,  we thank you,"  Rickfield barbed, "for that  introduction.  
Now, if there are no further interruptions," he glared at  Nancy, 
"Mr. Trew-Blow, would you care to read your prepared statement. 

"No,  Senator,"   Pierre came back.  A hush  descended  over  the 
entire  room.  He paused long enough to increase the  tension  in 
the room to the breaking point.  "I never use prepared notes.   I 
prefer  to  speak casually and honestly.  Do you  mind?"   Pierre 
exaggerated  his French accent for effect. After years of  public 
appearances,  he knew how to work and win a crowd.   The  cameras 
again  flashed as Pierre had just won the first round  of  verbal 
gymnastics. 

"It is a bit unusual, not to have an advanced copy of your state-
ments, and then . . ." Rickfield stopped himself in mid sentence. 
"Never mind, I'm sorry.  Please, Mr. Trew-Blow, proceed."

"Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman." Pierre scanned the room to  see  how 
much of it he commanded.  How many people were actually listening 
to  what he was going to say, or were they there for the  experi-
ence and another line item on a resume?  This was his milieu.   A 
live audience, and a TV audience as an extra added bonus.  But he 
had planned it that way.  

He  never told anyone that he was the one who called the TV  sta-
tions to tell them that there would be a significant news  devel-
opment  at  the Rickfield hearings.  If he  concentrated,  Pierre 
could speak like a native American with a Midwest twang.  He gave 
CNN, NBC, CBS and ABC down home pitches on some of the dirt  that 
might come out. Only CNN showed up.  They sent a junior producer. 
So what, everyone has to start somewhere.  And this might be  his 
big break.

"Mr.  Chairman, committee members," his eyes scanned the dais  as 
he  spoke. "Honored guests," he looked around the hall to  insure 
as many people present felt as important as possible, "and inter-
ested  observers, I thank you for the opportunity to address  you 
here today."  In seconds he owned the room.  Pierre was a  capti-
vating  orator.  "I must plead guilty to the overly kind  remarks 
by  Senator Deere, thank you very much.  But, I am  not  feigning 
humility  when I must lavish similar praises upon the many  dedi-
cated friends at dGraph, whom have made our successes possible."

Mutual  admiration society, thought Scott.  What a pile  of  D.C. 
horseshit,  but this Pierre was playing the game better than  the 
congressional  denizens.   As Pierre spoke, the  corners  of  his 
mouth twitched, ever so slightly, but just enough for the observ-
er  to note that he took little of these  formalities  seriously.  
The lone TV camera rolled.

"My  statement will be brief, Mr. Chairman, and I am  sure,  that 
after it is complete you will have many questions," Pierre  said.  
His tone was kind, the words ominous. 

"I  am not a technical person, instead, I am a dreamer.  I  leave 
the bits and bytes to the  wizards who can translate dreams  into 
a reality.  Software designers are the alchemists who can in fact 
turn silicon into gold.  They skillfully navigate the development 
of  thoughts from the amorphous to the tangible.  Veritable  art-
ists, who like the painter, work from tabula rasa, a clean slate, 
and  have a picture in mind.  It is the efforts of tens of  thou-
sands  of dedicated software pioneers who have pushed  the  fron-
tiers  of technology to such a degree that an  entire  generation 
has grown up in a society where software and digital  interaction 
are assimilated from birth.

"We have come to think, perhaps incorrectly, in a discreet  quan-
tized,  digital if you will, framework.  To a certain  extent  we 
have  lost  the ability to make a good  guess."   Pierre  paused.  
"Think about a watch, with a second hand.  The analog type.  When 
asked for the time, a response might be 'about three-thirty',  or 
'it's  a quarter after ', or 'it's almost ten.'   We  approximate 
the time.

"With  a  digital watch, one's response will  be  more  accurate; 
'one- twenty-three," or '4 minutes before twelve,' or 'it's  nine 
thirty-three.'   We  don't have to guess anymore.  And  that's  a 
shame.  When we lose the ability to make an educated guess,  take 
a stab at, shoot from the hip, we cease using a valuable creative 
tool.  Imagination!

"By  depending  upon them so completely, we fall hostage  to  the 
machines  of our creation; we maintain a constant  reliance  upon 
their  accuracy  and infallibility.  I am aware of  the  admitted 
parallel  to many science fiction stories where  the  scientists' 
machines  take over the world.  Those tales are, thankfully,  the 
products  of  vivid imaginations.  The technology  does  not  yet 
exist  to worry about a renegade computer.  HAL-9000 series  com-
puters  are still far in the future.  As long as we,  as  humans, 
tell  the computer to open the pod bay doors, the pod  bay  doors 
will open."  Pierre elicited a respectful giggle from the  stand-
ing room only crowd, many of whom came solely to hear him  speak.  
Rickfield doodled.  

"Yet,  there is another viewpoint. It is few people, indeed,  who 
can honestly claim to doubt the answer displayed on their  calcu-
lator.  They have been with us for over 20 years and we  instinc-
tively  trust  in  their reliability.  We  assume  the  computing 
machine  to be flawless.  In many ways, theoretically it is  per-
fect.  But when man gets involved he fouls it up. Our fingers are 
too  big  for the digital key pad on  our  wristwatch-calculator-
timer-TV.  Since  we can't approximate the answer, we  have  lost 
that skill, we can't guess,  it becomes nearly impossible to know 
if we're getting the right answer.

"We  trust  our computers.  We believe it  when  our  spreadsheet 
tells  us  that  we will experience 50% annual  growth  for  five 
years.  We believe the automatic bank teller that tells us we are 
overdrawn.   We don't question it.  We trust the computer at  the 
supermarket.   As far as I know, only my mother adds up her  gro-
ceries by hand while still at the check-out counter."

While  the image sank in for his audience, Pierre picked  up  the 
glass  of ice water in front of him and sipped enough to wet  his 
whistle.  The crowd ate him up.  He was weaving a web, drawing  a 
picture, and only the artist knew what the climax would be.

"Excuse me." Pierre cleared his throat.  "We as a people  believe 
a  computer printout is the closest thing to God on  earth.   Di-
vinely  accurate, piously error-free.  Computerized  bank  state-
ments, credit card reports, phone bills, our life is stored  away 
in computer memories, and we trust that the information  residing 
there  is  accurate.  We want, we need to believe, that  the  ma-
chines  that  switch  the street lights, the ones  that  run  the 
elevator,  the one that tells us we have to go to traffic  court, 
we want to believe that they are right.

"Then  on yet another hand, we all experience the frustration  of 
the omnipresent complaint, 'I'm sorry the computer is down.   Can 
you call back?'"  Again the audience emotionally related to  what 
Pierre  was  saying.  They nodded at each other and  in  Pierre's 
direction to indicate concurrence.

"I,  as  many  of us have I am sure, arrived at a  hotel,  or  an 
airport, or a car rental agency and been told that we don't  have 
a  reservation.   For  me there is an  initial  embarrassment  of 
having  my hand slapped by the computer terminal via  the  clerk.  
Then,  I  react strongly.  I will raise my voice and say  that  I 
made  a  reservation, two days ago.  I did it myself.   Then  the 
clerk will say something like, 'It's not in the computer'.    How 
do you react to that statement?

"Suddenly your integrity is being questioned by an  agglomeration 
of  wire and silicon.  Your veracity comes into immediate  doubt.  
The  clerk  might think that you never even made  a  reservation.  
You  become a liar because the computer disagrees with you.   And 
to  argue  about  it is an exercise in  futility.   The  computer 
cannot  reason.  The computer has no ability to make  a  judgment 
about you, or me.  It is a case of being totally black or  white.  
And for the human of the species, that value system is unfathoma-
ble, paradoxical.  Nothing is black and white.  Yes, the computer 
is  black and white.  Herein again, the mind prefers the  analog, 
the continuous, rather than the digitally discreet.

"In these cases, the role is reversed, we blame the computer  for 
making errors.  We tend to be verbally graphic in the comments we 
make  about computers when they don't appear to work the  way  we 
expect  them  to.  We distrust them."  Pierre gestured  with  his 
arms to emphasize his point.  The crescendo had begun.

"The  sociological  implications are incredible. As a  people  we 
have  an  inherent  distrust of computers; they  become  an  easy 
scapegoat for modern irritations.  However, the balancing side of 
the scale is an implicit trust in their abilities.  The  inherent 
trust we maintain in computers is a deeply emotional one, much as 
a helpless infant trusts the warmth of contact with his  parents.  
Such  is the trust that we have in our computers,  because,  like 
the baby, without that trust, we could not survive."

He  let the words sink in.  A low rumbling began  throughout  the 
gallery and hall.  Pierre couldn't hear any of the comments,  but 
he was sure he was starting a stink. 

"It  is our faith in computers that lets us continue.  The  reli-
gious parallels are obvious. The evangelical computer is also the 
subject  of fiction, but trust and faith are inextricably  meshed 
into  flavors and degrees.  A brief sampling of  common  everyday 
items  and  events that are dependent on  computers  might  prove 
enlightening. 

"Without  computers, many of lifes' simple pleasures and  conven-
iences  would  disappear.  Cable television.   Movies  like  Star 
Wars.  Special effects by computer.  Magic Money Cards.   Imagine 
life  without them."  A nervous giggle met Pierre's social  slam.  
"Call  holding.   Remember  dial phones?   No  computers  needed.  
CD's?   The  staple   diet of teenage America is  the  bread  and 
butter  of the music industry.  Mail.  Let's not forget the  Post 
Office  and  other shippers.  Without computers  Federal  Express 
would  be no better than the Honest-We'll-Be-Here-Tomorrow  Cargo 
Company."

"Oh,  and yes," Pierre said dramatically. "Let's get rid  of  the 
microwave  ovens, the VCR's and video cameras. I think I've  made 
my point."

"I wish you would, Mr. Trew-Blow,"  Senator Rickfield caustically 
interjected.   "What  is  the point?"  Rickfield  was  making  no 
points taking on Pierre Troubleaux.  He was too popular.

"Thank  you,  Senator, I am glad you asked.  I was  just  getting 
there."  Pierre's  sugary treatment was an  appropriate  slap  in 
Rickfield's face.

"Please  continue."  The Senator had difficulty saying  the  word 
'please'.

"Yes sir.  So, the prognostications made over a decade ago by the 
likes of Steve Jobs, that computers would alter the way we  play, 
work  and think have been completely fulfilled.  Now, if we  look 
at  those years, we see a multi-billion dollar industry that  has 
made extraordinary promises to the world of business.   Computer-
ize  they say!  Modernize! Get with the times!  Make your  opera-
tion efficient!  Stay ahead of the competition!  And we  listened 
and we bought.

"With  a  projected  life cycle of between only  three  and  five 
years, technology progresses that fast, once computerized, forev-
er  computerized.  To keep up with the competitive Jones',  main-
taining  technical  advantages requires upgrading  to  subsequent 
generations  of computers.  The computer salespeople told  us  to 
run our businesses on computers, send out Social Security  checks 
by computer, replace typewriters with word processors and bank at 
home.   Yet,  somewhere in the heady days  of  phenomenal  growth 
during  the early 1980's, someone forgot.  Someone, or more  than 
likely  most of Silicon Valley forgot, that people  were  putting 
their  trust in these machines and we gave them no reason to.   I 
include myself and my firm among the guilty.

"Very  simply,  we have built a culture, an  economic  base,  the 
largest  GNP in the world on a system of inter-connected  comput-
ers.  We have placed the wealths of our nations, the backbone  of 
the  fabric of our way of life, we have placed our trust in  com-
puters  that do not warrant that trust.  It is incredible  to  me 
that  major financial institutions do not protect their  computer 
assets as well as they protect their cash on hand.

"I  find it unbelievable that the computers responsible  in  part 
for  the defense of this country appear to have more  open  doors 
than a thousand churches on Sunday.  It is incomprehensible to me 
that privacy, one of the founding principles of this nation,  has 
been ignored during the information revolution.  The massive data 
bases  that contain vast amounts of personal data on us all  have 
been  amply shown to be not worthy of trust.  All it takes  is  a 
home  computer  and elbow grease and you, or I,  or  he,"  Pierre 
pointed  at  various people seated around the room, "can  have  a 
field day and change anybody's life history.  What happens if the 
computer disagrees with you then?

"It  staggers  the  imagination that we have  not  attempted  any 
coherent strategy to protect the lifeblood of our society.  That, 
ladies and gentlemen is a crime.  We spend $3 trillion on weapons 
in  one decade, yet we do not have the foresight to  protect  our 
computers? It is a crime of indifference by business leaders.   A 
crime  against common sense by Congress who passes laws and  then 
refuses  to fund their enactment.  Staggeringly  idiotic.  Pardon 
me."   Pierre drained the water from his glass as the tension  in 
the hearing room thickened.

"We live the paradox of simultaneously distrusting computers  and 
being  required  to trust them and live with them.   We  are  all 
criminals in this disgrace.  Maybe dGraph more than most.  Permit 
me  to  explain  my involvement."  The electricity  in  the  room 
crackled and the novice CNN producer instructed the cameraman  to 
get it right.

"Troubleaux!"  A man's gruff accented voice elongated the  sylla-
bles  as  he shouted from the balcony in the rear.   A  thousands 
eyes  jerked  to the source of the sound  up  above.   Troubleaux 
himself turned in his seat to see a middle aged dark man, wearing 
a  turban,  pointing a handgun in his direction.  Scott  saw  the 
weapon and wondered which politician was the target.  Who was too 
pro-Israel  this week?  He immediately thought of Rickfield.  No, 
he didn't have a commitment either way.  He only rode the wave of 
popular sentiment.

Pierre  too,  wondered who was the target of a  madman's  suicide 
attack.  It had to be suicide, there was no escape.  

Scott's mind raced through a thousand thoughts during that  first 
tenth  of a second, not the endless minutes he later  remembered. 
In  the  next split second, Scott realized,  more  accurately  he 
knew, that Pierre was the target.  The would-be victim.  

As the first report from the handgun echoed through the cavernous 
chamber  Scott was mid-leap at Pierre.  Hell of a way to grab  an 
exclusive,  he thought.  He fell into Pierre as the  second  shot 
exploded.  Scott painfully caught the edge of the chair with  his 
shoulder while pushing Pierre over sideways.  They crumpled  into 
a heap on the floor when the third shot fired.  

Scott  glanced up at the turbanned man vehemently mouthing  words 
to  an  invisible entity skyward. The din from the panic  in  the 
room  made it impossible to hear.  Still brandishing the  pistol, 
the  assailant  began  to take aim again, at  Scott  and  Pierre.  
Scott attempted to wiggle free from the tangle of Pierre's  limbs 
and  the chairs around them.  He struggled to  extricate  himself 
but found it impossible. 

A  fourth shot discharged. Scott cringed, awaiting the worst  but 
instead  heard the bullet ricochet off a metal object above  him. 
Scott's  adrenal relief was punctuated by a loud and heavy  sigh.  
He  noticed  that the assailant's shooting arm had  been  knocked 
upwards  by a quick moving Capital policeman who violently  threw 
himself  at  the turbanned man so hard that  they  both  careened 
forward to the edge of the balcony.  The policeman grabbed onto a 
bench  which  kept  him from plummeting twenty  feet  below.  His 
target  was hurtled over the edge and landed prone on two  wooden 
chairs which collapsed under the force.  The shooting stopped. 

Scott groaned from discomfort and pain as he slowly began to pull 
away  from Pierre.  Then he noticed the blood.  A lot  of  blood.  
He  looked down at himself to see that his white pullover  shirt, 
the one with Mickey Mouse instead of an alligator over the breast 
pocket, was wet with red.  As was his jacket.  His left hand  had 
been on the floor, in a pool of blood that was oozing out of  the 
back  of Pierre's head.  Scott tried to consciously  control  his 
physical  revulsion to the body beneath him and the  overwhelming 
urge to regurgitate. 

Then  Pierre's  body moved.  His chest heaved heavily  and  Scott 
pulled  himself  away completely.  Pierre had been  hit  with  at 
least  two bullets, one exiting from the front of his  chest  and 
one  stripping away a piece of skull exposing the  brain.   Grue-
some. 

"He's alive! Get a doctor!"  Scott shouted. He lifted himself  up 
to see over the tables.  The mad shuffle to the exits  continued.  
No one seemed to pay attention. 

"Hey!  Is there a doctor in the house?"  

Scott  looked down at Pierre and touched the veins in  his  neck.  
They  were  pulsing, but not with all of  life's  vigor.   "Hey," 
Scott said quietly, "you're gonna be all right.  We got a  doctor 
coming.   Don't worry.  Just hang in there."  Scott lied, but  40 
years of movies and television had preprogrammed the sentiments.

"Drtppheeough . . ." Scott heard Pierre gurgle.

"What?  What did you say?"  Scott leaned his ear down  closer  to 
Pierre's mouth.

"DGOEROUGH."

"Take  it easy," Scott said to comfort the badly  injured  Pierre 
Troubleaux.  

"Nooo  . . ." Pierre's limp body made a futile attempt  at  move-
ment.  Scott held him back.

"Hey,  Pierre . . .you don't mind if I call you  Pierre?"   Scott 
adapted a mock French accent.  

"Noo, DNGRAAAAPHJG . . ."  

"Good.   Why don't you just lay back and wait.  The doctor'll  be 
here in a second . . ."

"Sick . . ."  Pierre managed to get out one word.

"Sick?  Sick?  Yeah, yeah, you're sick,"  Scott agreed sympathet-
ically.  

"DGRAF, sick."  The effort caused Pierre to pant quickly.

"Dgraf, sick?  What does that mean?"  Scott asked.

"Sick. DGraph sick."  Pierre's voice began to fade. "Sick.  Don't 
use it. Don't use . . ."

"What  do you mean don't use it?  DGraph?  Hey!"   Scott  lightly 
shook Pierre.  "You still with us?  C'mon, what'd you say?   Tell  
me again?  Sick?"

Pierre's body was still.

The bullshit put out by the Government was beyond belief, thought 
Miles.  How could they sit there and claim that all was well?  It 
was  common knowledge that computer security was dismal  at  best 
throughout  both  the civilian and military agencies.   With  the 
years  he  spent  at NSA he knew that security  was  a  political 
compromise and not a fiscal or technical reality.  And these guys 
lied  through their teeth.  Oh, well, he thought, that would  all 
change soon.

The report issued by the National Research Council in November of 
1990  concurred with Miles' assessment.  Security in the  govern-
ment  was a disaster, a laughable travesty if it weren't for  the 
danger  to national security.  The report castigated the  results 
of  decades of political in-fighting between  agencies  competing 
for survival and power.

He  and Perky spent the day watching the hearings at Miles'  high 
rise apartment.  They had become an item in certain circles  that 
Miles traveled and now they spent a great deal of time  together.  
After  several  on-again  off-again attempts  at  a  relationship 
consisting  of more than just sex,  they decided not to see  each 
other for over a year.  That was fine by Miles; he had missed the 
freedom of no commitments.  

At  an embassy Christmas party months later, they ran  into  each 
other and the old animal attraction between them was re-released.  
They spent the weekend in bed letting their hormones loose to run 
rampant on each other.  The two had been inseparable since.   She 
was  the first girl, woman, who was able to tolerate  Miles'  in-
flated egoand his constant need for emotional gratification.  

Perky  had  little idea, by design, of the work  that  Miles  was 
doing  for Homosoto.  She knew he was a computer  and  communica-
tions  wizard,  but that was all.  Prying was  not  her  concern.  
During  his angry outbursts venting  frustration with  Homosoto's 
pettiness,  Perky  supported him fully, unaware of  his  ultimate 
goal.

Perky found the testimony by Dr. Sternman to be educational;  she 
actually  began  to  understand some of  the  complicated  issues 
surrounding security and privacy.  In many ways it was scary, she 
told  Miles.  He agreed, saying if were up to him,  things  would 
get a lot worse before they get any better.  She responded to his 
ominous  comment with silence until Pierre Troubleaux  began  his 
testimony.

As  well  known  as Bill Gates, as charismatic  as  Steve  Jobs, 
Pierre  Troubleaux  was  regarded as a sexy,  rich  and  eligible 
bachelor   ready  for  the taking.  Stephanie  Perkins  was  more 
stirred  by  his appearance and bearing than his  words,  so  she 
joined  Miles  in rapt attention to watch his  orations  on  live 
television. 

When  the first shot rang out their stunned confusion echoed  the 
camera's erratic framing.  As the second shot came across the TV, 
Perky  sprang up and shouted, "No!"  Tears dripped from the  cor-
ners of her eyes.

"Miles! What's happening?  They're shooting him . . ." 

"I  don't know ."  A third shot and then the image of  Scott  and 
Pierre crumbling.   "Holy shit, it's an assassination!"

"Miles, what's going on here?"  Stephanie cried.

"This  is fucking nuts . . .he's killing him . . ." Miles  stared 
at  the  screen and spoke in a dull monotone.  "I  can't  believe 
this is happening, it's not part of the plan . . ."

"Miles,  Miles!"   She screamed, desperately trying  to  get  his 
attention.  "Who? Miles! Who's killing him?  What plan?"  

"Fucking Homosoto, that yellow skinned prick . . ."

"Homosoto?"  She stopped  upon hearing the name.

Miles leapt up from the couch and raced over to the corner of the 
room  with  his  computers.  He pounced on the  keyboard  of  the 
NipCom  computer and told it to dial Homosoto's number in  Japan.  
That son of a bitch better be there.  Answer, damn it.

     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT CONVERSATION>>>>>>

Homosoto!!!!!

The  delay seemed interminable as Miles waited for him to get  on 
line.  Perky followed him over to the computer and watched as  he 
made contact.  She knew that Miles and Homosoto spoke often  over 
the  computer,  too often for Miles' taste.  Homosoto  whined  to 
Miles  almost  every day, about one thing or another,  and  Miles 
complained to her about how irritating his childish  interference 
was.  But throughout it all, Perky had never been privy to  their 
conversations.   She had stayed her distance, until this time.  

Miles had been in rages before; she had become unwillingly accus-
tomed  to his furious outbursts.  Generally they  were  unfocused 
eruptions; a sophomoric way of releasing pent up energy and frus-
tration.  But this time, Miles' face clearly showed fear.  Steph-
anie saw the dread.  "Miles!  What does Homosoto have to do  with 
this?  Miles, please!"  She pleaded with him to include her.  The 
screen finally responded.

MR. FOSTER.  AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.

You imperial mother fucker.  

EXPLAINATION, PLEASE. 

You're a fucking murderer.

I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT.

Take  exception  to this, Jack!  What the hell did you  kill  him 
for?

I ASSUME YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION.

Aren't we the Einstein of Sushi land.

YOUR MANNERS.

You killed him! Why?

Stephanie  read the monitor and wept quietly as the  conversation 
scrolled before her.  She placed her hands on Miles' shoulders in 
an effort to feel less alone. 

IT  WAS  A NECESSARY EVIL.  HE COULD NOT BE PERMITTED  TO  SPEAK.  
NOT YET.

So you killed him?

ONE  OF MY PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE OVER ZEALOUS.  IT IS  REGRETTABLE, 
BUT NECESSARY.

It is not necessary to kill anyone.  Nowhere in the plan does  it 
call for murder!  That was part of our deal.

THE WINDS BLOW.  CONDITIONS CHANGE.

The wind blows up your ass! 

THAT  DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GOING TO TELL WHAT  HE 
KNEW. 

What the hell does he know?

DGRAPH.  THAT'S THE PROGRAM WE INFECTED.

DGraph?   That's impossible. That's the most popular  program  in 
the world.  How did you infect it?

I BOUGHT IT.

You own dGraph?  I thought that Data Tech owned them.

OSO  OWNS DATA TECH.  YOU DID NOT LISTEN TO YOUR OWN  ADVICE.   I 
BOUGHT  IT AFTER YOU VISITED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME.   IT  SEEMED 
PRUDENT.   WE  ALSO BOUGHT A HALF DOZEN  OTHER  SMALL,  PROMISING 
SOFTWARE COMPANIES, JUST AS YOU SUGGESTED.  VERY GOOD PLAN.

And Troubleaux knows?

OF COURSE.  HE HAD INCENTIVE.

So you try to kill him?

HE  LOST HIS INCENTIVE.  IT WAS NECESSARY.  HE WAS GOING TO  TELL 
AND, AS YOU SAID, SECRECY IS PARAMOUNT.  YOUR WORDS.

Yes, secrecy, but not murder.  I can't be part of that. 

BUT YOU ARE MR. FOSTER.  I HOPE THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT 
THAT WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

It had damn well better be.  

DO NOT FORGET MR. FOSTER THAT YOU HAVE A SIZABLE PAYMENT  COMING.  
I WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU LOSE THAT WHEN THINGS ARE SO CLOSE.

     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>

"Son of a bitch," Miles said out loud.  "Son of a bitch."

"What's  going on?  Miles?" Perky followed him back to the  couch 
in  front of the TV and sat close with her arm around  him.   She 
was still crying softly.

"It's gonna start. That's amazing."  He blankly stared forward. 

"What's gonna start?  Miles, did you kill someone?"

"Oh, no!" He turned to her in sincerity.  "That bastard  Homosoto 
did.  Jesus, I can't believe it."

"What are you involved in? I thought you were a consultant."

"I was.  Tomorrow I will be a very rich retired consultant."   He 
pulled her hands into his and spoke warmly.  "Listen, it's better 
that your don't know what's going on, much better.  But I promise 
you,   I  promise  you, that Homosoto is behind it,  not  me.   I 
couldn't ever kill anyone.  You need to believe that."

"Miles, I do, but you seem to know more than . . ."

"I  do,  and  I can't say anything.  Trust me,"  he  said  as  he 
brought her close to him.  "This will all work out for the  best.  
I promise you. Look at me," he said and pulled up her chin so she 
gazed  directly into his eyes.   "I have a lot invested  in  you, 
and this project.  More than you could ever know, and now that it 
is  nearly  over, I can put more time into you.  After  all,  you 
bear  some of the responsibility."  Miles' loving attitude was  a 
contradiction from his usual self centered pre-occupation.

"Me?"  She asked.

"Who got me involved with Homosoto in the first place?"  he  said 
glaring at her.

"I guess I did, but . . ."

"I  know, I'm kidding," he said squeezing her closer.   "I'm  not 
blaming  you  for  anything.  I didn't know he  could  resort  to 
murder,  and if I did, I never would have gotten involved in  the 
first place."

"Miles,  I love you."  That was the first time in their years  of 
on-again  off-again contact that she told him how she felt.   Now 
she had to decide if she would tell him that he was just  another 
assignment, and that in all likelihood she had just lost her job, 
too.  "I really do love you."

"The  last  goddamned time this happened was in the  1950's  when 
Puerto  Rican  revolutionaries started a shoot-em-up in  the  old 
gallery," the President shouted.  

Phil  Musgrave and Quinton Chambers listened to the angry  Presi-
dent.    His tirade began minutes after he summoned them both  to 
his office.   They were as frustrated and upset as he was, but it 
was their job to listen until the President had blown off  enough 
steam.

"I  am  well aware a democracy, a true democracy  is  subject  to 
extremist activists, but," the President sighed, "this is getting 
entirely out of hand.  What is it about this computer stuff  that 
stirs up so much emotion?"  He waited for an answer.

"I'm  not  sure  that computers are to blame,  sir,"  said  Phil.  
"First  of all, the assailant used a ceramic pistol.  No way  for 
our  security  to detect it without a physical  search  and  that 
wouldn't  go over well with anyone."  The brilliant Musgrave  was 
making  a  case  for calm rationality in the light  of  the  live 
assassination  attempt.  "Second, at this point there is no  con-
nection between Troubleaux and his attacker.  We're not even 100% 
sure that Troubleaux was the target."

"That's a crock Phil," asserted the President.  "It doesn't  take 
a  genius to figure out that there is an obvious  connection  be-
tween  this computer crap and the Rickfield incident. I  want  to 
know what it is, and I want to know fast."

"Sir,"  Chambers  said  quietly.  "We have the FBI  and  the  CIA 
investigating,  but until the perpetrator regains  consciousness, 
which may be doubtful because his spine was snapped in the  fall, 
we won't know too much."

The President frowned.  "Does it seem odd to you that Mason,  the 
Times reporter was there with Troubleaux at the exact time he got 
shot?"

"No  sir, just a coincidence.  It seems that computer  crime  has 
been his hot button for a while," Musgrave said.  "I don't  think 
he's involved at all."

"I'm  not suggesting that," the President interrupted.   "But  he 
does seem to be where the action is.  I think it would be prudent 
if we knew a bit more of his activities.  Do I need to say more?"

"No sir.  Consider it done."
