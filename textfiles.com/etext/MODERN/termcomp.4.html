                    Chapter 22

     Friday, January 8 
     Washington, D.C.

It seemed that everyone in the world wanted to speak to Scott  at 
once. The FBI spent an hour asking him inane questions.  "Why did 
you  help him?"  "Do you know Troubleaux?"  "Why were you at  the 
hearings?"   "Why  didn't you sit with the rest  of  the  press?"  
"Where's your camera?"  "Can we read your notes?"

Scott  was cooperative, but he had his limits.  "You're  the  one 
who's been writing those computer stories, aren't you?"   "What's 
in this for you?"  

Scott  excused himself, not so politely. If you want me for  any-
thing else, please contact the paper, he told the FBI agents  who 
had learned nothing from anyone else either.

He  escaped  from other reporters who wanted his  reporter's  in-
sight, thus learning what it was like to be hounded  relentlessly 
by  the  press.   Damned pain in the ass, he  thought,  and  damn 
stupid  questions.   "How  did  you feel  .  .  .?"    "Were  you 
scared . . .?"  "Why did you . . .?"

The  exhausted Scott found the only available solace in  a  third 
floor  men's room stall where he wrote a piece for the  paper  on 
his  GRiD laptop computer.  Nearly falling asleep on  the  toilet 
seat,  he temporarily refreshed himself with ice cold water  from 
the tap and changed from his bloodsoaked clothes into fresh jeans 
and a pullover from his hanging bag that still burdoned him.  One 
reporter  from the Washington Post thought himself lucky to  have 
found Scott in the men's room, but when Scott finished bombasting 
him with his own verbal  assault, the shell shocked reporter left 
well enough alone.

After  the  Capital  police were through  questioning  Scott,  he 
wanted  to make a swift exit to the airport and get  home.   They 
didn't  detain  him very long, realizing Scott  would  always  be 
available.   Especially since this was news. His  pocket  shuttle 
schedule  showed there was a 6:30 flight to Westchester  Airport; 
he  could then grab a limo home and be in bed by ten, that is  if 
the exhaustion didn't take over somewhere along the way.

Three  days in Europe on next to no sleep.  Rush back  to  public 
Senate  hearings  that no one has ever heard  about.   Television 
cameras  appear,  no one admits to calling the press,  and  then, 
Pierre.  He needed time to think, alone.  Away from the conflict-
ing  influences that were tearing at him.

On one hand his paper expected him to report and investigate  the 
news.   On another, Tyrone wanted help on his  investigation  be-
cause  official  Washington had turned their backs on  him.   And 
Spook.  Spook.  Why is that so familiar? Then he had to be honest 
with  his own feelings.  What about this story had so  captivated 
him  that  he  had let many of his other assignments  go  by  the 
wayside?

Doug  was pleased with Scott's progress, and after  today,  well, 
what  editor wouldn't be pleased to have a potential star  writer 
on  the  National news.   But Scott was drowning  in  the  story.  
There  were  too many pieces, from every  conceivable  direction, 
with  none too many of them fitting neatly together.  He  thought 
of the ever determined  Hurcule Poirot, Agatha Christie's  detec-
tive,  recalling  that the answers to a  puzzle  came  infinitely 
easier to the fictional sleuth than to him.  

Scott called into Doug.

"Are you all right?" Doug asked with concern but didn't wait  for 
an  answer.  "I got your message.  Next time call me at home.   I 
thought you were going to be in Europe till Wednesday."

"Hold your horses," Scott said with agitation.  Doug shut up  and 
listened to the distraught Scott.  "I have the story all  written 
for you.  Both of them are going into surgery and the Arab is  in 
pretty bad shape.  The committee made itself scarce real fast and 
there's no one else to talk to.  I've had to make a career out of 
avoiding reporters.  Seems like I'm the only one left with  noth-
ing to say."  Doug heard the exhaustion in Scott's voice.

"Listen," Doug said with a supportive tone.  "You've been doing a 
bang up job, but I'm sending Ben down there to cover the assassi-
nation attempt.  I want you to go to bed for 24 hours and  that's 
an order.  I don't want to hear from you till Monday."

Scott  gratefully acknowledged Doug's edict, and might have  sug-
gested  it himself if it weren't for his dedication to the  story 
he had spent months on already.  "O.K.," Scott agreed.  "I  guess 
not much will happen . . ."

"That's  right.  I want you fresh anyway," Doug said with  vigor.  
"If  anything  major comes up, I'll see that we call  you.   Fair 
enough?"

Scott checked his watch as his cab got caught up in the slow late 
afternoon rush hour traffic on the George Washington Parkway.  If 
he  missed this flight, he thought, there was another one  in  an 
hour.   The pandemonium of Friday afternoon National Airport  had 
become  legendary.  Despite extensive new  construction,  express 
services and modernized terminals, the airport designers in their 
infinite  wisdom had neglected in any way to improve the flow  of 
automobile traffic in and out of the airport.

As they approached, Scott could see the American terminal several 
hundred  yards  away  from his cab.  They were  stuck  behind  an 
interminable  line  of other taxis, limousines,  cars  and  mini-
busses that had been stacking for ten minutes.  Scott decided  to 
hike the last few yards and he paid the driver who tried to  talk 
him into remaining till the ride was over.  Scott weaved  through 
the standstill traffic jam until he saw the problem.  So typical. 
A stretch Mercedes 560, was blocking the only two lanes that were 
passable.  Worse yet, there was no one in the car.  No driver, no 
passengers.  Several airport police were discussing their options 
when a tall, slender black man, dressed in an impeccably tailored 
brown suit came rushing from the terminal doors.

"Diplomatic  immunity!" He called out with a  thick,  overbearing 
Cambridge accent.

The  startled  policemen saw the man push several people  to  the 
side,  almost  knocking one elderly woman to the  ground.   Scott 
reached the Mercedes and stayed to watch the upcoming encounter 

"I  said, Diplomatic immunity,"  he said  authoritatively.   "Put 
your tickets away."

"Sir,  are you aware that your car has been blocking  other  cars 
from . . ." 

"Take it up with the Embassy," the man said as he roughly  opened 
the driver's door. "This car belongs to the Ambassador and he  is 
immune from your laws."  He shut the door, revved the engine  and 
pulled  out squealing his tires.  Several pedestrians had  to  be 
fleet of foot to miss being sideswiped. 

"Fucking camel jockeys," said one younger policeman.

"He's from equatorial Africa, Einstein," said another.

"It's all the same to me.  Foreigners telling us how to live  our 
lives," the third policeman said angrily.

"You  know,  I can get 10 days for spitting on  the  ground,  but 
these assholes can commit murder and be sent home a hero.  It's a 
fucking crime," the younger one agreed.

"O.K.,  guys, leave the politics to the thieves on Capital  Hill.  
Let's get this traffic moving," the senior policeman said as they 
started the process of untangling airport gridlock.

Another  day in the nation's capital, Scott thought.   A  melting 
pot  that  echoed  the days of Ellis Island.  Scott  carried  his 
briefcase,  laptop computer  and garment bag through the  crowded 
terminal  and made a left to the men's room next to the new  blue 
neon  bar.   Drinks were poured especially fast in  the  National 
Airport Bar.  Fliers were traveling on such tight schedules  that 
they  had to run to the bar, grab two quick ones and dash to  the 
gate.  The new security regulations placed additional premiums on 
drinking  time.  The bar accommodated their hurried  needs  well.  
Scott  put down his baggage next to the luggage pile and stole  a 
bar  seat  from a patron rushing off to catch his  flight.    One 
helluva chaotic day.  He ordered a beer, and sucked down half  of 
it  at  once.  The thirst quenching was  a  superior  experience.  
Brain dulling would take a little longer.

The clamorous rumble of the crowd and the television blaring from 
behind  the  bar further anesthetized Scott's  racing  mind.   He 
finally  found  himself engrossed in the  television,  blissfully 
ignorant of all going on around him.  Scott became so absorbed in 
the local news that he didn't notice the striking blonde sit next 
to  him.  She ordered  a white wine and made herself  comfortable 
on the oversized stool.

Scott  turned to the bartender and asked for another beer  during 
the  commercial.  It was then he noticed the gorgeous woman  next 
to him and her golden shoulder length hair.  Lightly tanned  skin 
with  delicate crow's feet at the edges of her  penetrating  blue 
eyes gave no indication of her age.  An old twenty to a  remarka-
ble forty five.  Stunning, he thought.  Absolutely stunning.   He 
shook  the thought off and returned his attention to the  televi-
sion.

He  heard the announcer from Channel 4, the local NBC  affiliate.  
"Topping  tonight's  stories, Shooting at Senate  Hearing."   The 
picture  changed from the anchorman to a live feed  from  outside 
the  New  Senate  Office Building, where  Scott  had  just  been. 
"Bringing it to us live is Shauna Miller.  Shauna?"

"Thank  you  Bill,"  she said looking straight  into  the  camera 
holding the microphone close to her chin.  Behind her was a  bevy 
of police and emergency vehicles and their personnel in a  flurry 
of activity. 

"As  we first reported an hour ago, Pierre Troubleaux,  President 
of  dGraph, one of the nation's leading software  companies,  was 
critically  injured  while giving testimony to  the  Privacy  and 
Technology  Containment subcommittee.  At 3:15 Eastern  Time,  an 
unidentified assailant, using a 9mm Barretta, shot Mr. Troubleaux 
four times, from the visitor's balcony which overlooks the  hear-
ing room.  Mr. Troubleaux was  answering questions about . . . "

Scott's mind wandered back to the events of a few hours ago.   He 
still  had  no idea why he did it.  The television  replayed  the 
portion of the video tape where Pierre was testifying.  While  he 
spoke,  the shots rang out and the camera image suddenly  blurred 
in search of the source of the sound.  Briefly the gunman is seen 
and  then the picture swings back to Pierre being pushed  out  of 
his  chair by a man in a blue sports jacket and white shirt.   As 
two  more gun shots ring out the figure covers Pierre.  Two  more 
shots and the camera finally settles on Pierre Troubleaux  bleed-
ing profusely from the head, his eyes open and glazed. 

Scott shuddered at the broadcast.  It captured the essence of the 
moment, and the terror that he and the hundreds of others at  the 
hearing had experienced.  Shauna Miller reappeared.  

"And  we  have here the man who dove to Mr.  Troubleaux's  rescue 
when the shooting began." The camera angle pulled back and showed 
Scott standing next to the newswoman.

"This is Scott Mason, a reporter from the New York City Times who 
is  attending the hearings on behalf of his paper.   Scott,"  she 
turned away from the camera to speak directly to Scott. "How does 
it  feel being the news instead of reporting it?"  She stuck  the 
microphone into his face.

"Uh,"  Scott stammered.  What an assinine question,  he  thought.  
"It  does  give me a different perspective," he said,  his  voice 
hollow. 

"Yes,  I  would think so," Shauna added.  "Can you tell  us  what 
happened?"

More  brilliance in broadcast journalism.  "Sure, be  happy  to." 
Scott  smiled at the camera.  "One of the country's finest  soft-
ware executives just had part of his head blown off so his brains 
could leak on my coat and the scumbag that shot him took a  sayo-
nara  swan dive that broke every bone in his body.  How's  that?"  
He said devilishly.

"Uh," Shauna hesitated.  "Very graphic."  This isn't Geraldo  she 
thought, just the local news.  "Do you have anything to add?" 

"Yeah?  I got to get some sleep."

The  camera zoomed into a closeup of Shauna Miller.  "Thank  you, 
Mr. Mason."  She brightened up.  "Mr. Troubleaux and the  alleged 
gunman  have been taken to Walter Reed Medical Center where  they 
are  undergoing surgery.  Both are listed in  critical  condition 
and  Mr.  Troubleaux is still in a coma."  Shauna droned  on  for 
another 30 seconds with filler nonsense.  How did she ever get on 
the air, Scott thought.  And, why does she remain?

"That was you."  

Scott  started  at the female voice.  He turned to the  left  and 
only  saw  salesmen  and male lobbyists  drinking  heartily.   He 
pivoted  in the other direction and came face to face with  Sonja 
Lindstrom.   "Sorry?"  

"That  was you," she said widening her smile to expose a  perfect 
Crest ad.

An  electric  tingle ran up Scott's legs and through  his  torso.  
The  pit of his stomach felt suddenly empty.  He gulped  silently 
and his face reddened.  "What was me?"

She  pointed  at the television.  "That was you  at  the  hearing 
today, where Troubleaux got shot."  

"Yeah, 'fraid so," he said. 

"The  camera treats you well.  I was at the hearing, too,  but  I 
just figured out who you were."  Her earnest compliment came as a 
surprise to Scott. He raised his eyebrows in bewilderment. 

"Who I am?"  He questioned.

"Oh,  sorry," she extended her hand to Scott.  "I'm  Sonja  Lind-
strom.   I gather you're Scott Mason."  He gently took  her  hand 
and  a rush of electricity rippled up his arm till the  hairs  on 
the back of his neck stood on end.  

"Guilty  as charged," he responded.  He pointed his thumb at  the 
television.  "Great interview, huh?"

"She epitomizes the stereotype of the dumb blond."  Sonja  turned  
her head slightly.  "I hope you're not prejudiced?"

"Prejudiced?  

She  picked  up  her wine glass and  sipped  gingerly.   "Against 
blondes."

"No, no. I was married to one,"  he admitted.  "But, I won't hold 
that  against you."  Scott wasn't aggressive with women  and  his 
remark surprised even him.  Sonja laughed appreciatively.

"It  must have been rough," Sonja said empathetically.   "I  mean 
the blood and all."

"Not exactly my cup of tea.  I don't do the morgue shift."  Scott 
shuddered.  "I'll stick to computers, not nearly so adventurous."

"And  hacker bashing." she said firmly.  She took another sip  of 
wine.

"How would you know that?" Scott asked.

She turned and smiled at Scott.  "You're famous.  You're known as 
the  Hacker  Smacker by quite a few in the computer  field.   Not 
everyone  appreciates  what  you have to say."   Sonja,  ever  so 
politely, challenged Scott.   

"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn," he smirked. 

"That's  the  spirit," she encouraged.  "Not that  I  agree  with 
everything you have to say."

"I assume you have read my drivel upon occasion."

"Upon occasion, yes," she said with a coy sweetness.

"So,  since you know so much about me, I stand at a clear  disad-
vantage.  I only know you as Sonja."  

"You're  right.  That's not fair at all."  She straightened  her-
self  on the bar stool.  "Sonja Lindstrom, dual citizenship  U.S. 
and  Denmark.  Born May 11, 1964, Copenhagen.  Moved here when  I 
was two.  Studied political science at George Washington, minored 
in sociology.  Currently a public relations consultant to comput-
er jocks.  I live in D.C. but I'm rarely here."

"Lucky for me," Scott ventured. 

Sonja  didn't answer him as she slowly drained the bottom of  her 
wine  glass.  She glanced slyly at him, or was that his  imagina-
tion?

"Can a girl buy a guy a drink?"

The  clock said there was fifteen minutes before  Scott's  flight 
took off.  No contest.

"I'd be honored," Scott said as he nodded his head in gratitude. 

Sonja  Lindstrom bought the next two rounds and they talked.   No 
serious  talk, just carefree, sometimes meaningless  banter  that 
made them laugh and relish the moment.   Scott didn't know he had 
missed his second flight until it was time for the 8:15 plane  to 
LaGuardia.   It had been entirely too long. Longer than he  cared 
to remember since he had relaxed, disarmed himself near a  woman.  
There was an inherent  distrust, fear of betrayal, that Scott had 
not released, until now. 

"So, about your wife," she asked after a lull in their  conversa-
tion.

"My wife?"  Scott shrank back.

"Humor me," she said.

"Nothing against her, it just didn't work out."

"What happened?"  Sonja pursued.

"She was an artist, a sculptor.  And if I say so myself, an awful 
one.  A three year old could do as well with stale Play-Dough."

"You're a critic, too?"  Sonja bemused.

"Only  of  her art.  She got into the social scene in  New  York, 
gallery  openings,  the  she-she sect.  You know  what  I  mean?"  
Sonja  nodded. "So, when I decided to make a career shift,  well, 
she wasn't in complete agreement with me.  Even though in 8 years 
she had never sold one single piece of art, she was convinced, by 
her  socialite pals, that her work was  extraordinarily  original 
and  would  become, without any doubt, the next Pet Rock  of  the 
elite."  

"So?"

"So,  she gets the bug to go to the Coast and make her  mark.   I 
think  some  of her Park Avenue pals went to  Beverly  Hills  and 
wanted her to come out to be their entertainment. She expected me 
to follow her hallucinations, but I just couldn't play that part. 
She's a little left of the Milky Way for me."

"How long has it been?"  Sonja asked with warmth. 

"Three years now."

"So, what have these years been like?"

"Oh,  fine,"  he said. Sonja gave him a disbelieving dirty  look.  
"O.K., kinda lonely.  I'm not complaining, mind you, but when she 
was there, no matter how inane our conversations were, not matter 
how  far out in the stratosphere her mind was, at least  she  was 
someone to talk to, someone to come home to.  She's a sweet girl, 
I  loved  her, but she had needs that . . .well.  It  wasn't  all 
bad, we had a great few years.  I just couldn't let her  madness, 
harmless  though  it was, run my life.  We're still  friends,  we 
talk fairly often.  I hope she becomes the next Dali."

"That's very gracious of you,"  Sonja said sincerely.

"Not  really.  I really feel that way.  It's her life,  and,  she 
never  wanted  or tried to hurt me.  She was just  following  her 
star."

"Has she sold any of her art?"  Sonja asked.

"It's on perpetual display, she says," Scott said.

"Why don't you buy one?  To make her feel good?"

"Ha!   She feels fine.  Beverly Hills is not the worst  place  in 
the  world  to be accepted."  He lost himself in  thought  for  a 
moment.  "I think it has worked out for both of us." 

"Except, you're lonely," she came back. 

"I got into my work.  A career shift at my age, you know, I had a 
lot to learn.  So, I've really put myself into the job, and  I've 
been  getting a lot out of it."  He stared at the gorgeous  woman 
to whom he had been telling his personal feelings.  "But, yes,  I 
do miss the companionship," he hinted.

The  clock over the bar announced it was quarter to  ten.  "Hey." 
Scott turned to face Sonja squarely. "I gotta go, you don't  know 
how  much I don't want to, but I gotta."  He spoke with a  pained 
sincerity.

"No you don't," she said exuberantly.

"Huh?"

Sonja's  entire  face  glowed .  "Have  you  ever  done  anything 
crazy?"

"Sure, of course," Scott nonchalantly said.

"No,  I mean really crazy.  Totally off the wall.   Spontaneous."  
She  grabbed Scott's shoulders.  "Haven't you ever wanted  to  go 
off  the deep end and not care what anybody thinks?"  Scott  felt 
himself  getting  captured by her exuberance.    This  absolutely 
stunning blonde bombshell exuded enough sexual enthusiasm for the 
entire NFL, and yet, he was playing it cool.  He wondered why.

"I was a real hell raiser as a kid . . ."

"Listen, Scott." Her demeanor turned serious. "Are you willing to 
do something outrageous right now?  And go through with it?"

Here was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen  asking 
him to make a borderline insane promise.  Her painted lips  broke 
into a lush smile. Ten minutes to the last flight.

"I'm game.  What is it?" Scott played along.  He could always say 
no.  Right?

"Wait  here a minute." Sonja grabbed her purse and dashed out  of 
the bar.  Scott's eyes followed her in stunned amazement.

Scott  finished  his beer and the clock indicated that  the  last 
flight to New York had left.  He wondered what was keeping  Sonja 
so long, and then she suddenly whisked back into the bar. 

"C'mon,  we have to hurry." Sonja shuffled papers in and  out  of 
her  purse.   She threw enough money on the bar  to  cover  their 
drinks.

Scott scooted off of his bar stool laughing.  "Hurry? Where're we 
going?"

"Shhhh,  get  your bags," Sonja said urgently.  "You  do  have  a 
passport don't you?" She asked with concern.

"I  just  came from Europe, yeah."  His  bewilderment  was  clear 
while he retrieved his luggage.

"Good. Follow me."

Sonja  dashed  through the terminal to the  security  check  with 
Scott  struggling to keep up.  The view of her  exquisite  figure 
was noticed by more than just Scott, but she left him little time 
to relish the view.  She tossed her purse on the conveyor belt as 
a  dazed Scott struggled with his own two bags.  She darted  from 
the  security station leaving Mason to reorganize  himself.   His 
ability to run was encumbered by his luggage so he watched  care-
fully to see into which gate she was headed. 

Gate, gate?  Where am I going? And why? He would have laughed  if 
he wasn't out of breath from wind sprinting through the  airport.  
He followed Sonja into Gate 3.

She handed a couple of tickets to the attendant.  "We're the last 
ones, hurry up, Mason," Sonja giggled.

"Where are we going . . .where did the tickets . . .how are you?"  
Scott stumbled through his thoughts.

"Just  get  on the plane.  We'll talk." She held  out  her  hand, 
beckoning him seductively.  

The  attractive flight attendant stared at Scott.  His  hesitancy 
was holding up the flight. He looked at Sonja.  "This is insane," 
he said quietly.

"So it is."

"Where?  I mean where is this plane headed?"

"Jamaica," she beamed.

"Oh,  Sonja,  come  on, this isn't real."  Why the  hell  was  he 
trying to talk himself out of a fantasy in the making.

"I'm  getting on.  I need a weekend to cool out, and I  know  you 
do.   After  what happened."  Sonja took the  separated  boarding 
pass and looked back once before she left. Scott stood still.  He 
stared as Sonja disappeared down the tunnel to the plane.

The  flight attendant appeared quite annoyed.  "Well, are you  or 
aren't you?" 

Scott reasoned that if he reasoned out the pros and the cons  the 
plane  would be gone regardless of his decision.  "Fuck  it,"  he 
said and he walked briskly down the ramp.

He entered the Airbus behind the cockpit and turned right to find 
Sonja.  It didn't take long.  She was the only person sitting  in 
first  class.   "Fancy running into you here,"  she  said  waving 
from the plush leather seat. 

"Quite," he said in his well practiced West London accent.  "Dare 
I  guess  how long it's been?"  He placed his bags in  the  empty 
first class storage compartment.  

"Too long.  Much too long. You had me worried," Sonja said  melo-
dramatically.

"I still have me worried."

"I thought you might chicken out," she said.

"I still might."

The three hour flight was replete with champagne, brie and  simi-
lar  delicacies.  They munched and sipped to their  heart's  con-
tent.  One flight attendant, two passengers.  Light talk, innocu-
ous  flirtations, not so innocuous flirtations, more  chatting  - 
time passed, hours disguised as seconds. 

Half  Moon Bay is a one hour cab ride from the airport and,  true 
to  Jamaican hospitality, the hotel staff expected  them.    They 
were led to two adjoining rooms after being served the obligatory 
white  rum  punch with a yellow umbrella.  It was  nearly  3  AM.  
Scott was working on 60  hours with little or no sleep.

"Scott?" Sonja asked as they prepared to go into their respective 
rooms.

"Yes," he said.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For tomorrow night."

After four hours sleep, Sonja knocked on Scott's door.  "Rise and 
shine!  Beach time!"

Scott  swore to himself, looked at the clock on the night  stand, 
and then swore again.  Ugh!  Scott forced himself out of bed  and 
opened the door.  The vision of Sonja Lindstrom in a bathing suit 
that used no more than 4 square inches of material was  instantly 
arousing.   Despite  39 plus years of  morning  aversions,  Scott 
readied  himself  at breakneck speed, thinking that  reality  and 
fantasy were often inseparable.  The question was, what was this?  
Was  he really in the Caribbean? No!, he thought.  This is  real!  
Holy shit, this is real.  I wasn't as drunk as I thought. Intoxi-
cation takes many forms, and this appears to be a delicious wine.  
During  breakfast she managed to talk him into going to the  nude 
beach, about a half mile down Half Moon Bay.

"God,  you're uptight," she said as she shed her g-string on  the  
isolated  pristine  coastline.  She was a natural  blond  with  a 
dancer's body where the legs and buttocks merge into one.  

"I am not!"  He defended.

"I  bet  you  can't take them off.  For  personal  reasons,"  she 
laughed out loud pointing at the baggy swim suit he borrowed from 
the  resort.  She lay down on her back, perfectly formed  breasts 
pointing  at  the sky.  Scott noticed only the  faintest  of  tan 
lines several inches below her belly button.  She patted the huge 
towel,  inviting  Scott to join her.  There was room  enough  for 
three,

"Well,"  he agreed.  "It might prove embarrassing.  I thought  my 
intentions were honorable."

"Bull.   Neither are mine."  She arched her back and  patted  the 
towel again.

"Fuck it," he said laughingly as he dropped his bathing suit  and 
dropped  quickly,  facedown  next to Sonja.   "Ouch!"  He  yelled 
louder  than the hurt was worth.  "I hate it when that  happens," 
he said checking to make sure that the pieces were still intact.

They  spent the next two days exploring Half Moon Bay,  the  lush 
green hills behind the resort and each other.  Scott forgot about 
work,  forgot about the hackers, forgot about Tyrone.   He  never 
thought about Kirk, Spook, or any of the blackmail schemes he was 
so  caught up in investigating.  And, he forgot, at least  tempo-
rarily  about the incident with Pierre.  The world  consisted  of 
only  two people, mutually radiating a glow flush  with  passion; 
retreating into each other so totally that no imaginable distrac-
tion could disturb their urgings.

They slept no more than an hour all Saturday night, "I told you I 
wanted to thank you for tomorrow night!"  she said.  They made it 
to  the  water's  edge early Sunday morning.   Scott's  body  was 
redder in some places than it had ever been, and Sonja's tan line 
all but disappeared. They both knew that the fantasy was going to 
be  over  in the morning, a 7:00 AM flight back to  reality,  but 
neither spoke of it.  The Here and Now was the only reality  that 
they wanted to face.

"I'm  impressed," Sonja said turning to face Scott on  the  beach 
towel.   No matter in which direction she turned, her body  stood 
tall and firm.

"Impressed, with what?" Scott giggled.

"I had two days to loosen you up before you went back to that big 
bad city.  I'm ahead of schedule."

"What schedule?"

"Scott, we need to talk."  Sonja reached over and touched Scott's 
shoulder.  He couldn't take his eyes off of her magnificent  nude 
figure.   "Did you ever work on something, for a very long  time; 
really get yourself involved, dedicated, and then find out in was 
all for the wrong reasons?  That's how I feel now."

     Saturday, January 10

It is not uncommon for the day employees at the CIA in Langley to 
arrive at their desks before 6:00 AM.  Even on a Saturday. Today, 
Martin  Templer  arrived early to prepare for an  update  meeting 
with the director.  Nothing special, just the weekly report.   He 
found  that  he  could get  more done early in  the  morning.  He 
enjoyed  the time alone in his quiet office so he could  complete 
the  report without constant interruption.  Not  fifteen  minutes 
into his report, his phone rang.  Damn, he thought, it's starting 
already.

"Yeah?" Templer said gruffly into the mouthpiece.

"Martin?"  

"Yeah, who's this?"

"Alex."

Templer  had almost forgotten about their meeting.   "Will  small 
wonders never cease.  Where have you been?"

"Still  in Europe. I've been looking for some answers as we  dis-
cussed."

"Great! What have you got?"  Templer grabbed a legal pad.

"Nothing,"  Alex said with finality.  "Nothing.  Nobody knows  of 
any such operation, not even a hint."  Alex had mastered the  art 
of  lying twenty years ago.  "But I'll tell you," he  added,   "I 
think that you may be on to something."

"If  there's nothing, how can there be something?"  asked  Martin 
Templer. 

This  was  Alex's opportunity to throw the CIA  further  off  the 
track.  Since he and Martin were friends, as much  as is possible 
in  this line of work, Alex counted on being believed,  at  least 
for  a while.  "Everybody denies any activity and that in  itself 
is unusual.  Even if nothing is happening, enough of the snitches 
on  the  street will claim to be involved to  bolster  their  own 
credibility.   However,  my friend, I doubt a handful  even  know 
about your radiation, but it has gotten a lot of people thinking.  
I  get the feeling that if they didn't know about your  problems, 
they will soon enough.  I wish I could be of further help, but it 
was all dead ends."

"I  understand. It happens; besides it was a long  shot,"  Martin 
sighed.  "Do me a favor, and keep your eyes and ears open."

"I will, and this one is on the house," said Alex.  

After  he hung up something struck Martin as terribly wrong.   In 
twenty years Alex had never, ever, done anything for free.  Being 
a true mercenary, it wasn't in his character to offer  assistance 
to  anyone without sufficient motivation, and that  meant  money.  
Martin  noted the event, and reminded himself to include that  in 
his report to the Director.

The television coverage of the Senate hearings left Taki Homosoto 
with radically different emotions.  He had to deal with them both 
immediately.

     DIALING . . . 
     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT CONVERSATION>>>>>>

I AM NOT PLEASED.

Ahmed  Shah  heard his communications computer beep at  him.   He 
pushed the joystick control on his wheelchair and steered over to 
read Homosoto's message.  

Greetings

THAT WAS A MOST SLOPPY JOB.

Some things cannot be helped.

WHY IS HE NOT DEAD?

It was a difficult hit.

IS THAT WHAT YOU TELL ARAFAT WHEN YOU MISS?

I do not work for Arafat.

YOUR MAN IS ALIVE TOO.

Yes, fortunately.

NO,  THAT  IS UNFORTUNATE.  ELIMINATE HIM.  AND  MAKE  SURE  THAT 
TROUBLEAUX IS TAKEN CARE OF.   HE MUST NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE.

He is in a coma.

PEOPLE WAKE UP.  I DO NOT WANT HIM TO WAKE UP.

It will be done.  I promise you.

I DO NOT WANT PROMISES.  I WANT THEM BOTH DEAD.  TROUBLEAUX  MUST 
NOT BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK TO ANYONE.  IS THAT CLEAR?

Yes, it will be done.

FOR YOUR SAKE I HOPE SO.  I DO NOT TOLERATE SLOPPINESS.  

     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>

Homosoto  dialed his computer again, to a number inside  Germany.  
The  encryption  and privacy keys were automatically  set  before 
Alex Spiradon's computer answered.  To Homosoto's surprise,  Alex 
was there.

MR ALEX.

Yes.

CONGRATULATIONS.  RICKFIELD IS BEING MOST COOPERATIVE.

He has many reasons to.

MILLIONS OF REASONS.

We  merely gave him the incentive to cooperate.  I do not  expect 
that he will maintain his position for very long.

YOUR HANDLING OF HIM HAS BEEN EXCELLENT.  I HAVE NOT SEEN A  U.S. 
NEWSPAPER.  HOW DO THEY REACT TO HIS COMMITTEE?

He  took  a small beating from a couple of  papers,  but  nothing 
damaging.  It's the way Washington works.

WHO IS SENATOR DEERE?  SHE COULD PRESENT A PROBLEM.

I don't think so.  Between her and Rickfield, the sum total  will 
be a big zero.  There will be confusion and dissension.  I  think 
it works in our favor.  

I WILL FOLLOW THE PROGRESS WITH INTEREST.  WHEN ARE THE  HEARINGS 
TO CONTINUE?

Next  week.   One other thing.  You asked that I  get  to  Scott.  
Consider  it done.  You found a most attractive weakness  and  he 
succumbed  instantly.   But, I should say, I don't think  it  was 
necessary.  He is doing fine on his own.

I THINK IT IS NECESSARY.  IT IS DONE?

We have a conduit.

KEEP THE PIPELINE FULL.

     What's wrong with Ford?
     by Scott Mason

Ford is facing the worst public relations disaster for an automo-
bile manufacturer since the Audi acceleration problem made inter-
national news.

Last  month in Los Angeles alone, over 1200 Ford Taurus and  Mer-
cury  Sable cars experienced a total breakdown of the  electrical 
system.   Radios  as well as anti-skid braking controls  and  all 
other  computer  controlled functions in the  automobiles  ceased 
working. 

To  date,  no deaths have been attributed to the  car's  epidemic 
failures.

Due  to the notoriety and questions regarding the safety  of  the 
cars, sales of Taurus's have plummeted by almost 80%.  Unlike the 
similar  Audi  situation where the alleged problem was  found  in  
only  a few isolated cases, the Taurus failures have  been  wide-
spread and catastrophically sudden.

According  to  Ford,  "There has never been a  problem  with  the 
Taurus  electronics' system.  We are examining all  possibilities 
in determining the real cause of the apparant failures."

What else can Ford say?

Mercedes  owners have already organized a legal entity  to  force

having sudden electrical failures.  Following in the footsteps of 
Ford  and Chrysler, this is the first time that Mercedes has  not 
issued  an  immediate  'Fix' to its dealer.   Three  deaths  were 
reported when . . .

     Sunday January 10
     National Security Agency 

"What do you make of this Mason piece?"  

"I'd  like to know where the hell he gets his information,"  said 
the aide.  "That's what I make of it."

"Someone's obviously leaking it to him," Marvin Jacobs,  Director 
of the National Security Agency, said to his senior aid.   "Some-
one with access to a great deal of sensitive data."  The  disdain 
in his voice was unmistakable. 

Even  though it was Sunday, it was not unusual for him to  be  at 
his office.  His more private endeavors could be more  discreetly 
pursued.   A three decade career at the Agency had culminated  in 
his  appointment to the Directorship, a position he had eyed  for 
years.

"We  have  specialists who use HERF technology," the  aide  said.  
"It's more or less a highly focused computer-gun.  An RF field on 
the  order of 200 volts per meter is sufficient to  destroy  most 
electrical  circuits.   Literally blow them up  from  the  inside 
out."

"Spare me the details."

"Sir,  we can stop a car from a thousand yards by pointing  elec-
tricity at  it."

"I don't really care about the details."

"You should, sir. There's a point to this . . ."

"Well, get on with it."  Jacobs was clearly annoyed. 

"Unlike  the EMP-T technology which is very expensive and on  the 
absolute edge of our capabilities . . ."

"And someone elses . . ."

"Granted,"  the aide said, sounding irritated with  the  constant 
interruptions.  "But HERF can be generated cheaply by anyone with 
an  elementary  knowledge of electronics.   The  government  even 
sells surplus radio equipment that will do the job quite nicely."  

Jacobs smiled briefly. 

"You look pleased," the aide said with surprise.

Jacobs hid his pleasure behind a more serious countenance.   "Oh, 
no,  it's just the irony of it all.  We've been warning them  for 
years and now it's happening."

"Who, sir?"

"Never  mind,"  Jacobs said, dismissing the thought  momentarily. 
"Go on."

Jacobs arrogantly leaned back in his executive chair, closed  his 
eyes  and folded his hands over his barrel chest.  This  was  his 
way of telling subordinates to talk, spill their guts.

"The  real worry about cheap HERF is what it can do in the  wrong 
hands."   The  aide  obliged the ritual.   "One  transmitter  and 
antenna  in  a small truck can wipe out every  computer  on  main 
street during a leisurely drive.  Cash registers, electric  type-
writers, alarms, phones, traffic lights . . .anything  electronic 
a HERF is pointed at, Poof! Good as dead.  What if someone used a 
HERF gun at an airport, pointing up?  Or at the tower? From up to 
a distance of over a kilometer, too.  Ten kilometers with  better 
equipment."

"So  it  works," muttered Jacobs so softly under his  breath  his 
aide didn't hear. 

"It's  reminiscent of drive-by shootings by organized crime.   In 
this case, though, the target is slightly different."

"I  see."   Jacobs  kept his eyes closed as  the  aide  patiently 
waited  for his boss to say something or allow him to  return  to 
his family.  "I gather we use similar tools ourselves?"

"Yessir.  Very popular technique. Better kept quiet."

"Not any more.  Not any more."

     Monday, January 11
     Washington, D.C.

I  don't  think you're gonna be pleased," Phil Musgrave  said  at 
their  early  morning conclave, before the President's  busy  day 
began.  

"What else is new?" asked the President acerbically.  "Why should 
I  have an easy today any more than any other day?"  His dry  wit 
often  escaped  much of the White House staff, but  Musgrave  had 
been exposed to it for over 20 years and took it in stride.  Pre-
coffee grumps.  The President poured himself more hot decaf  from 
the silver service.  "What is it?"

"Computers."

The  President  groaned.  "Don't you ever long for the  old  days 
when  a calculator consisted of two pieces of sliding wood  or  a 
hundred beads on rods?"

Musgrave ignored his boss's frustration. "Over the weekend,  sir, 
we  experienced  a number of incidents that could  be  considered 
non-random in nature," Musgrave said cautiously.

"In English, Phil," insisted the President.

"MILNET has been compromised.  The Optimus Data Base at  Pentagon 
has  been erased as has been Anniston, Air Force Systems  Command 
and a dozen other computers tied through ARPANET."

The President sighed. "Damage report?"

"About  a  month.   We didn't lose anything  too  sensitive,  but 
that's not the embarrassing part."

"If that's not, then what is?"

"The  IRS computers tied to Treasury over the  Consolidated  Data 
Network?"   The  President indicated to continue.   "The  Central 
Collection Services computer for the Dallas District has had over 
100,000 records erased.  Gone."

"And?"  The President said wearily.

"The IRS has had poor backup procedures.  The OMB and GAO reports 
of  1989 and 1990 detailed their operational shortcomings."   The 
President  waited for Phil to say something he could  relate  to.  
"It  appears that we'll lose between $500 million and $2  Billion 
in revenues."

"Christ! That's it!"  The President shouted.  "Enough is  enough.  
The  two weeks is up as of this moment."  He shook his head  with 
his   eyes   closed  in  disbelief.  "How  the  hell   can   this 
happen . . .?" he asked rhetorically.

"Sir, I think that our priority is to keep this out of the press.  
We need plausible deniability . . ."

"Stop  with the Pentagon-speak bullshit and just clamp down.   No 
leaks.   I want this contained.   The last damn thing we need  is 
for  the public to think that we can't protect our own  computers 
and the privacy of our citizens.  If there is one single leak,  I 
will  personally  behead the offender," the President  said  with 
intensity enough to let Phil know that his old friend and comrade 
meant what he said.  

"Issue  an  internal directive, lay down the  rules.   Who  knows 
about this?"

"Too many people, sir.  I am not convinced that we can keep  this 
completely out of the public eye."

"Isolate them."

"Sir?"

"You  heard  me.  Isolate them.  National  Security.   Tell  them 
it'll  only  be  few days.  Christ.  Make up any damn  story  you 
want, but have it taken care of.  Without my knowledge."

"Yessir."

"Then, find somebody who knows what the hell is going on."

     Monday, January 11
     Approaching New York City

Scott called Tyrone from the plane to discover that  the hearings 
were being delayed a few days, so he flew back to New York  after 
dropping  Sonja  off in Washington.  They tore  themselves  apart 
from  each other, she tearfully, at  National Airport where  they 
had met.   He would be back in a few days, once the hearings were 
rescheduled.  In the meantime, Scott wanted to go home and crash.  
While  being in Jamaica with Sonja was as exhilarating as  a  man 
could want, relaxing and stimulating at once, he still was  going 
on next to no rest.

While the plane was still on the tarmac in Washington, Scott  had 
fallen fast asleep.  On the descent into New York, he half  awak-
ened,  to a hypnagogic state.  Scott had learned over  the  years 
how  to  take advantage of such semi-conscious  conditions.   The 
mind seemingly floated in a place between reality and  conjecture 
-  where all possibilities are tangible, unencumbered by  earthly 
concerns.   The drone of the jet engines, even  their  occasional 
revving,   enhanced  the  mental  pleasure   Scott   experienced.  
Thoughts  weightlessly drifted into and out of his head, some  of 
them  common and benign and others surprisingly original, if  not 
out and out weird.  

In  such a state, the conscious mind becomes the observer of  the 
activities  of  the  unconscious mind.  The ego  of  Scott  Mason 
restrained itself from interfering with the sublime mental  proc-
esses  that bordered on the realm of pure creativity.   The  germ 
of  a  thought, the inchoate  idea, had the luxury  of  exploring 
itself  in  an infinity of possibilities and the  conscious  mind 
stood on the sidelines.  The blissful experience was in  constant 
jeopardy  of  being relegated to a weak memory,  for  any  sudden 
disturbance  could  instantly cause the subconscious  to  retreat 
back  into  a merger with the conscious mind.   Thus,  he  highly 
valued these spontaneous meditations. 

Bits and pieces of the last few days wove themselves into complex  
patterns  that reflected the confusion he felt.  He continued  to 
gaze  on and observe as the series of mental events that  had  no 
obvious  relationships assumed coherency and meaning.   When  one 
does not hold fixed preconceived notions, when one has the abili-
ty to change perspective, then, in these moments, the  possibili-
ties multiply.  Scott watched himself with the hackers in Amster-
dam, with Kirk and Tyrone at home;  he watched himself both  live 
and die with Pierre in Washington.  Then the weekend, did it just 
end?   The unbelievable weekend with Sonja.  It was when  he  re-
lived  the sexual intensity on the Half Moon Bay beach,  in  what 
was  becoming an increasingly erotic   state, that his  mind  en-
tered an  extraordinary bliss.

The rear tires of the plane hitting the runway was enough to snap 
Scott  back to a  sober reality.  But he had the thought  and  he 
remembered it.

Scott  hired a stretch limousine at LaGuardia and slept  all  the 
way  to  Scarsdale, but lacking the good sense God gave  him,  he 
checked  the messages on his phone machine.  Doug called to  find 
out if Scott still worked for the paper and Ty called requesting, 
almost pleading, that Scott call as soon as he got back.  He  had 
to see him, post haste.

The  call  to Doug was simple.  Yes, I'm back.  The  hackers  are 
real.  They  are a threat.  Pierre is still alive,  I  have  more 
material than we can use.  I did take notes, and my butt is  sun-
burned.  If there's nothing else, I'm dead on my feet and I  will 
see you in the morning. Click.  

Now  he  wanted to talk to Tyrone as much as it sounded  like  Ty 
wanted  to speak to him.  Where was he? Probably at  the  office.  
He dialed quickly. Tyrone answered with equal speed.

"Are you back?" Ty asked excitedly.

"Yeah, just got in.  I need to talk to you . . ."

"Not as much as we do, buddy.  Where are you now?"

"Home.  Why?"

"I'll  see  you  in an hour.  Wait there."  The FBI  man  was  in 
control.   Where the hell else am I going to go, Scott thought.

Scott  piddled around, making piles for his maid,  unpacking  and 
puttering  around the kitchen.  Everything in the  fridge  needed 
cooking, and there was not enough energy for that, so he  decided 
to take a shower.  That might give him a few more hours before he 
collapsed.

Exactly  one hour later, as promised, Tyrone Duncan rang  Scott's 
doorbell.   They  exchanged a few pleasantries and  then  plunged 
into  intense  information exchange.  They grabbed  a  couple  of 
beers  and  sat  opposite each other  in  overstuffed  chairs  by 
Scott's wide fireplace.

"Boy have I learned a lot . . ."  said Scott.

"I think you may be right," said Tyrone.

"Of course I am.  I did learn a lot," Scott said with a  confused 
look on his face. 

"No I mean about what you said."

"I  haven't  said anything yet.  I think there's  a  conspiracy."  
Scott winced to himself as he said the one word that was the bane 
of many a reporter.  

"I said I think you were right.  And are right."

"What the devil are you talking about?"  Scott was more  confused 
then ever.

"Remember a few months back, on the train we were talking."

"Of  course we were talking."  Scott recognized the humor in  the 
conversation.

"No! I mean we were . . .shit. Shut up and listen or I'll  arrest 
you!"

"On what charge?"

"CRS."

"CRS?"

"Yeah, Can't Remember Shit. Shut up!"

Scott  leaned back in his chair sipping away.  He had  gotten  to 
Ty.  Hooked him, reeled him in and watched him flop on the  deck.  
It  pissed Ty off to no end to allow himself to be suckered  into 
Scott's occasional inanity.

"When this whole blackmail thing started up there was no apparent 
motivation," Tyrone began.  "One day you said that the motivation 
might  be  a disruption of normal police and FBI  operations.   I 
think  you might be right.  It's looking more and more  that  the 
blackmail stuff was a diversion."

"What makes you think so now?" Scott asked.

"We  had  a ton of cases in the last few weeks, same  victims  as 
before, who were being called again, but this time with  demands.   
They were being asked to cough up a lot of cash in a short  time, 
and stash it in a very public place.  We had dozens of stakeouts, 
watching the drop points for a pick up.  It read like the  little 
bastards  were  finally getting greedy.  You know what  I  mean?"   
Scott nodded in agreement, thinking, where is this going?

"So  we had a couple hundred agents tied up waiting for  the  bad 
guys  to  show up.  And you know what?  No one showed.   No  one, 
damn  it. There must have been fifty million in cash  sitting  in 
bus terminals, train stations, health clubs, you name it, and  no 
one  comes to get any  of it?  There's something wrong with  that 
picture."

"And you think it's a cover?  Right?"  Scott grinned wide.   "For 
what?"

Ty  shrank back in mild sublimation. "Well," he began,  "that  is 
one  small piece of the puzzle I haven't filled in yet.   But,  I 
thought  you might be able to help with that."   Tyrone  Duncan's 
eyes met Scott's and said, I am asking as a friend as well as  an 
agent.  Come on, we both win on this one.

"Stop  begging, Ty. It doesn't befit a member of the  President's 
police force," Scott teased.  "Of course I was going to tell you.  
You're  gonna  read about it soon enough, and I  know,"  he  said 
half-seriously, "you won't screw me again."  

Ouch,  thought Tyrone.  Why not pour in the salt while you're  at 
it.  "I wouldn't worry.  No one thinks there's a problem.  I keep 
shouting and being ignored.  It's infinitely more prudent in  the 
government to fuck-up by non-action than by taking a position and 
acting upon it.  I'm on a solo."

"Good enough," Scott assured Ty.  "'Nother beer?"  It felt  good. 
They were back - friends again.

"Yeah,  It's six o'clock somewhere," Tyrone sighed.   "So  what's 
your news?"

"You know I went over to this Hacker's Conference . . ."

"In Amsterdam." added Tyrone.

"Right,  and I saw some toys that you can't believe," Scott  said 
intently.   "The term Hacker should be replaced with Dr.  Hacker.  
These  guys are incredible.  To them there is no such thing as  a 
locked door.  They can get into and screw around with any comput-
er they want."

"Nothing new there," said Ty.

"Bullshit. They're organized.  These characters make up an entire 
underground society, that admittedly has few rules, but it's  the 
most coherent bunch of anarchists I ever saw."

"What of it?"

"Remember that van, the one that blew up and."

"How can I forget."

"And then my Tempest article."

"Yeah.  I know, I'm sorry," Tyrone said sincerely.

"Fuck  it.   It's over.  Wasn't your fault.  Anyway,  I  saw  the 
equipment  in actual use.  I saw them read computers with  anten-
nas.   It  was  absolutely incredible.  It's  not  bullshit.   It 
really works."  Scott spoke excitedly.  

"You say it's Tempest?"

"No,  anti-Tempest.  These guys have got it  down.    Regardless, 
the stuff works."

"So what?  It works."

"So,  let's  say, if the hackers use these computer  monitors  to 
find out all sorts of dirt on companies,"  Scott slowly explained 
as he organized his thoughts.  "Then they issue demands and cause 
all sorts of havoc and paranoia.  They ask for money.  Then  they 
don't  come to collect it.  So what have they  achieved?"   Scott 
asked rhetorically.

"They  tied up one shit load of a lot of police time,  I'll  tell 
you that."

"Exactly.  Why?"

"Diversion.  That's where we started," Ty said.

"But who is the diversion for?"

The light bulb went off in Tyrone's head.  "The hackers!"

"Right,"  agreed  Scott.  "They're the ones who are going  to  do 
whatever  it  is that the diversion is covering.  Did  that  make 
sense?"

"No,"  laughed Ty, "but I got it.  Why would the hackers have  to 
be covering for themselves.  Couldn't they be working for someone 
else?"

"I doubt it. This is one independent bunch of characters,"  Scott 
affirmed.  "Besides, there's more.  What happened in D.C. . . ."

"Troubleaux," interrupted Ty.

"Bingo.  And there's something else, too."

"What?"

"I've  been  hearing about a computer system called  the  Freedom 
League.   Nothing specific, just that everything about it  sounds 
too good to be true."

"It usually is."

"And  one other thing.  If there is some sort of hacker  plot,  I 
think I know someone who's involved."

"Did he admit anything?"

"No, nothing.  But, well, we'll see."  Scott hesitated and  stut-
tered.  "Troubleaux, he said something to me."

"Excuse me?" Ty said with disbelief.  "I thought his brains  were 
leaking out."

"Thanks for reminding me; I had to buy a new wardrobe."

"And a tan?  Where've you been?"  

"With, well," Scott blushed, "that's another story."

"O.K.,  Romeo,  how  did he talk?  What did he  say?"   Ty  asked 
doubtfully. 

"He told me that dGraph was sick."

"Who's dGraph?"

"dGraph,"  laughed Scott, "is how your secretary keeps your  life 
organized.  It's the most popular piece of software in the world.  
Troubleaux  founded  the  company.  And I think I  know  what  he 
meant."

"He's a nerdy whiz kid, huh?" joked Tyrone

"Just  the  opposite.  Mongo sex appeal to the ladies.   No,  his 
partner  was the . "  Scott stopped mid sentence.  "Hey,  I  just 
remembered  something.  Troubleaux had a partner, he founded  the 
company with him.  A couple of days before they went public,  his 
partner  died.  Shook up the industry.  Shortly  thereafter  Data 
Tech bought them."

"And you think there's a connection?" 

"Maybe,  ah...I can't remember exactly," Scott said.   "Hey,  you 
can find out."

"How?"

"Your computers."

"They're at the office."

Scott pointed to his computer and Tyrone shook his head  violent-
ly.  "I don't know how to. "

"Ty," Scott said calmly.  "Call your secretary.  Ask her for  the 
number and your passwords."  Scott persuaded Ty to be humble  and 
dial  his office.  He was actually able to guide Ty  through  the 
process  of accessing one of the largest collections of  informa-
tion in the world.

"How  did you know we could do that?" Ty asked after they  logged 
into the FBI computer from Scott's study.

"Good guess.  I figured you guys couldn't function without remote 
access.  Lucky."

Tyrone  scowled kiddingly at Scott. "You going over to the  other 
side boy?  You seem to know an awful lot."

"That's  how  easy this stuff is. Anyone can do it.   In  fact  I 
heard  a  story about octogenarian hackers who  work  from  their 
nursing homes.  I guess it replaces sex." 

"Bullshit," Tyrone said pointing at his chest.  "This is one dude 
who's knows the real thing. No placebos for me!"

They  both laughed.  "You know how to take it from  here?"  asked 
Scott once a main menu appeared.

"Yeah, let me at it.  What the hell did you want to know anyway?"

"I  imagine you have a file on dGraph, somewhere inside the  over 
400,000,000 active files maintained at the FBI."  

"I'm beginning to worry about you.  That's classified . . ."

"It's  all in the company you keep," Scott chided.  "Just ask  it 
for dGraph."  Tyrone selected an Inquiry Data Base and asked  the 
computer for what it knew about dGraph.  In a few seconds, a sub- 
menu  appeared  entitled "dGraph, Inc.".  Under the  heading  ap-
peared several options:

     1. Company History
     2. Financial Records 
     3. Products and Services
     4. Management
     5. Stock Holders
     6. Activities
     7. Legal
     8. Comments

"Not bad!" chided Scott.  "Got that on everyone?"

Tyrone  glared at Scott.  "You shouldn't even know  this  exists.  
Hey, do me a favor, will ya? When I have to lie later, at least I 
want  to  be able to say you weren't staring over  my  shoulders.  
Dig?"

"No  problem," Scott said as he pounced on the couch in front  of 
the  desk.  He knocked a few days of mail onto the floor to  make 
room.  "O.K., who founded the company?"

"Founded 1984, Pierre Troubleaux and Max Jones . . ."

"That's it!" exclaimed Scott.  "Max Jones.  Where?"

"Cupertino, California."

"What date did they go public?" Scott asked quickly.

"Ah, August 6, 1987.  Anything else massah?" Tyrone gibed.

"Can you tie into the California Highway Patrol computers?"

"What if I could?"

"Well, if you could, I thought it would be interesting to take  a 
look  at the police reports.  Because, as I remember,  there  was 
something  funny  about Max Jones,"  Scott said, and  then  added 
mockingly, "but that's only if you have access to the same infor-
mation  that anyone can get for $2. It's all  public  information 
anyway."

"You know I'm not supposed to be doing this,"  Tyrone said as  he 
pecked at the keyboard.

"Bullshit. You do it all the time."

"Not  as  a public service."  The screen darkened  and  then  an-
nounced that Tyrone had been given access to the CHiP  computers.  
"So suppose I could do that, I suppose you'd want a copy of it."

"Only if the switch on the right side of the printer is turned ON 
and  if  the  paper  is straight.   Otherwise,  I  just  wouldn't 
bother."  Scott stared at the ceiling while the dot matrix print-
er sang a high pitched song as the head traveled back and forth. 

Tyrone  scanned the print out coming from the computers in  Cali-
fornia.  "You have one fuckuva memory.  Sheee-it."  Scott sat  up 
quickly.

"What, what does it say?" Scott pressured.

"It  appears that your friend Max Jones was killed in an  automo-
bile  accident  on Highway 275 at 12:30 AM."  Ty  stopped  for  a 
moment  to  read more.  "He was found, dead, at the bottom  of  a 
ravine where his car landed after crashing through the  barriers.  
Pretty high speed.  And, the brake lines were cut."

"Holy  shit," Scott said rising from his chair. "Does two a  pat-
tern make?"

"You mean Troubleaux and Max?" asked Tyrone.

"Yeah, they'll do."

"In  my mind it would warrant further investigation."  He made  a 
mental note.

"Anything else there?" Scott asked.

"This  is the kicker," Ty added.  "The investigation  lasted  two 
days.  Upstairs told the department to make it a quick and clean, 
open and shut case of accident."

"I  assume  no one from dGraph had any reason to doubt  what  the 
police told them.  It sounds perfectly rational."

"Why  should they if nobody kicked up a stink?" Ty said  to  him-
self.   "Hey,"  he said to Scott.  "You think  he  was  murdered, 
don't you?"

"You  bet your ass I do," Scott affirmed.  "Think about it.   The 
two  founders of a company the size of dGraph, they're huge,  one 
dead  from a suspicious accident, and the other the target of  an 
assassination and in deep shit in the hospital."

"And it was the hackers, right?"  laughed Tyrone.

"Maybe," Scott said seriously.  "Why not?  It's all tying togeth-
er."

"There's no proof," Tyrone said.  

"No,  and  I  don't need it yet.  But  I  sense  the  connection.  
That's  why  I  said there's a conspiracy."  He  used  that  word 
again.  

"And who is behind it and why? Pray tell?"  Tyrone needled Scott.  
"Nothing's   even   happened,   and   you're   already   spouting 
conspiracy."

"I  need to do something.  Two things."  Scott spoke  firmly  but 
vacantly.  "I  need to talk to Kirk.  I think  there's  something 
wrong with dGraph, and he can help."

"And two?"

"I'd like to know who I saw in Amsterdam."

"Why?" Ty asked.

"Because . . .because, he's got something to do with  . .  .what-
ever it is.  He as much as admitted it."

"I think I can help with that one," offered Ty.

"Huh?"  Scott looked surprised.

"How about we go into my office and see who this guy is?"  Tyrone 
enjoyed the moment.  One upping Scott.  "Tomorrow."

Scott  decided  that  the fastest way to reach  Kirk,  he  really 
needed Kirk, was to write a clue in an article.  Scott dialed the 
paper's  computer  from his house and opened a  file.  He  hadn't 
planned on writing today - God, how long have I been awake?  This 
was  the easiest way to contact Kirk now, but that was  going  to 
change.   Tyrone  left early enough for Scott to  write  a  quick 
piece that would be sure to make an inside page, page 12 or 14.

     The Computer As Weapon?  
     by Scott Mason

Since the dawn of civilization, Man has had the perverse  ability 
to turn Good into Bad, White into Black, Hot into Cold, Life into 
Death.   History  bears out that technology is falling  into  the 
same trap.  The bow and arrow, the gun; they were created to help 
man  survive  the elements and feed himself.  Today  millions  of 
guns are bought with no purpose other than to hurt another  human 
being.   The  space program was going to send man to  the  stars; 
instead we have Star Wars.  The great advantages that  technology 
has  brought  modern  man have been  continuously  subverted  for 
malevolent uses.

What if the same is true for computers?

Only yesterday, in order to spy on my neighbor, or my opponent, I 
would hire a private eye to perform the surveillance.  And  there 
was  a constant danger of his being caught.  Today?  I'd hire  me 
the  best computer hacker I could get my hands on and sic him  on 
the targets of my interest.  Through their computers.

For  argument's  sake, let's say I want  advance  information  on 
companies  so I can play the stock market.  I have my hacker  get 
inside the SEC computers, (he can get in from literally thousands 
of locations nationwide) and read up on the latest figures before 
they're  reported to the public.  Think of betting the whole  wad 
on a race with only one horse.  

I would imagine, and I am no lawyer, that if I broke into the SEC 
offices  and  read through their file cabinets, I would be  in  a 
mighty poke of trouble.  But catching me in their computer is  an 
extraordinary  exercise  in  resource  frustration,  and  usually 
futile.   For unlike the burglar, the computer criminal is  never 
at the scene of the crime.  He is ten or a hundred or a  thousand 
miles  away.   Besides, the better computer  criminals  know  the 
systems  they  attack so well, that they can cover  their  tracks 
completely; no one will ever know they were an uninvited guest.

Isn't then the computer a tool, a weapon, of the computer  crimi-
nal?  I can use my computer as a tool to pry open your  computer, 
and  then once inside I use it to perhaps destroy pieces of  your 
computer or your information.    

I  wonder  then about other computer crimes, and I  will  include 
viruses  in  that  category.  Is the computer or  the  virus  the 
weapon?   Is  the virus a special kind of computer  bullet?   The 
intent and the result is the same.  

I  recall hearing an articulate man recently make the  case  that 
computers  should  be licensed, and that not everyone  should  be 
able  to own one.  He maintained that the use of a computer  car-
ried  with  it an inherent social responsibility.   What  if  the 
technology that gives us the world's highest standard of  living, 
convenience and luxury was used instead as a means of disruption; 
a technological civil disobedience if you will?  What  if politi-
cal  strength came from the corruption of an opponent's  computer 
systems?  Are we not dealing with a weapon as much as a gun is  a 
weapon? my friend pleaded. 

Clearly  the computer is Friend.  And the computer, by itself  is 
not bad, but recent events have clearly demonstrated that it  can 
be  used  for sinister and illegal purposes.  It is  the  use  to 
which  one  puts the tool that determines its  effectiveness  for 
either good or bad.  Any licensing of computers, information sys-
tems, would be morally abhorrent - a veritable decimation of  the 
Bill of Rights.  But I must recognize that the history of  indus-
trialized  society does not support my case.

Automobiles were once not licensed.  Do we want it any other way?  
I  am sure many of you wish that drivers licenses were harder  to 
come by.  Radio transmitters have been licensed for most of  this 
century  and  many a civil libertarian will make  the  case  that 
because  they are licensed, it is a restriction on my freedom  of 
speech  to require approval by the Government  before  broadcast.  
On the practical side, does it make sense for ten radio  stations 
all trying to use the same frequency?

Cellular  phones are officially licensed as are CB's.   Guns  re-
quire  licenses in an increasing number of states.  So  it  might 
appear  logical  to say that computers be  licensed,  to  prevent 
whatever overcrowding calamity may unsuspectingly befall us.  The 
company  phone effectively licenses lines to you, with the  added 
distinction of being able to record everything you do.

Computers  represent an obvious boon and a potential bane.   When 
computers  are  turned against themselves, under the  control  of 
humans  of course, or against the contents of the computer  under 
attack,  the results can ripple far and wide.  I believe  we  are 
indeed fortunate that computers have not yet been turned  against 
their  creators by faction groups vying for power and  attention.   
Thus far isolated events, caused by ego or accident have been the 
rule and large scale coordinated, well executed computer assaults 
non-existent.

That, though, is certainly no guarantee that we will not have  to 
face the Computer Terrorists tomorrow.

This is Scott Mason searching the Galaxy at Warp 9.

     Tuesday, January 12
     Federal Square, New York

Tyrone was required to come to the lobby of the FBI headquarters, 
sign Scott in and escort him through the building.  Scott  didn't 
arrive until almost eleven; he let himself sleep in, in the hopes 
of  making up for lost sleep.  He knew it didn't work  that  way, 
but twelve hours of dead rest had to do something.

Tyrone explained as they took an elevator two levels beneath  the 
street that they were going to work with a reconstructionist.   A 
man  with  a very powerful computer will build up the  face  that 
Scott  saw, piece by piece.  They opened a door that was  identi-
fied  by only a number and entered an almost sterile work  place.  
A  pair of Sun workstations with large high  resolution  monitors 
sat  on  large white tables by one wall, with a row of  racks  of 
floor to ceiling disk drives and tape units opposite.  

"Remember," Tyrone cautioned, "no names."

"Right," said Scott.  "No names."  

Tyrone  introduced Scott to Vinnie who would be running the  com-
puter.   Vinnie's  first job was to familiarize  Scott  with  the 
procedure.   Tyrone  told Vinnie to call him in his  office  when 
they  had  something;he had other matters to attend  to  in  the 
meantime.    Of  obvious Italian descent, with a  thick  Brooklyn 
accent,  Vinnie  Misselli epitomized the local boy  making  good.  
His  lantern jaw and classic Roman good looks were out  of  place 
among the blue suits and white shirts that typified the FBI.

"All I need," Vinnie said, "is a brief description to get  things 
started.  Then, we'll fix it piece by piece."

Scott  loosely described the Spook.  Dark hair, good looking,  no 
noticeable  marks  and  of course, the dimples.   The  face  that 
Vinnie built was generic. No unique features, just a nose and the 
other  parts that anatomically make up a face.  Scott  shook  his 
head, no that's not even close.  Vinnie seemed undaunted.  

"O.K., now, I am going to stretch the head, the overall shape and 
you  tell me where to stop. All right?"  Vinnie asked,  beginning 
his manipulation before Scott answered.

"Sure," said Scott.  Vinnie rolled a large track ball built  into 
the  keyboard  and  the head on the screen  slowly  stretched  in 
height  and  width.  The changes didn't help Scott  much  he  but 
asked Vinnie to stop at one point anyway.  

"Don't worry, we can change it later again.  How about the eyes?"

"Two," said Scott seriously.

Vinnie gave Scott an ersatz dirty look. "Everyone does it,"  said 
Vinnie.  "Once."  He grinned at Scott.

"The eye brows, they were bushier," said Scott.

"Good.   Tell  me when."  The eyebrows on the  face  twisted  and 
turned  as  Vinnie moved the trackball with his  right  hand  and 
clicked at the keyboard with his left.  

"That's  close," Scott said.  "Yeah, hold it."  Vinnie froze  the 
image  where  Scott  indicated  and they went  on  to  the  hair.  
"Longer, wavier, less of a part . . ."

They  worked  for an hour, Vinnie at the  computer  controls  and 
Scott changing every imaginable feature on the face as it evolved 
into  one  with  character.  Vinnie sat back  in  his  chair  and 
stretched.  "How's that," he asked Scott.

Scott  hesitated.  He felt that he was making too  many  changes.  
Maybe this was as close as it got.  "It's good," he said  without 
conviction.  There was a slight resemblance.

"That's  what  they all say," Vinnie said. "It's not  even  close 
yet."   He laughed as Scott looked shocked.  "All we've  done  so 
far is get the general outline.  Now, we work on the details."  

For  another  two  hours Scott commented on  the  subtle  changes 
Vinnie  made to the face.  Nuances that one never thinks of;  the 
curve  of the cheek, the half dozen angles of the chin, the  hun-
dreds of ear lobes, eyes of a thousand shapes - they went through 
them all and the face took form.  Scott saw the face take on  the 
appearance  of  the Spook; more and more it became  the  familiar 
face he had spent hours with a few days ago.  

As he got caught up in the building and discovery process,  Scott 
issued commands to Vinnie; thicken the upper lip, just a  little.  
Higher  forehead.  He blurted out change after change and  Vinnie 
executed  every  one.  Actually, Vinnie preferred  it  this  way, 
being given the orders.  After all, he hadn't seen the face.  

"There! That's the Spook!" exclaimed Scott suddenly. 

"You  sure?"  asked  Vinnie sitting back in  the  plush  computer 
chair.

"Yup," Scott said with assurance.  "That's him."

"O.K.,  let's see what we can do  . . ." Vinnie rapidly typed  at 
the keyboard and the picture of the face disappeared.  The screen 
went  blank  for a few seconds until it was replaced  with  a   3 
dimensional  color model of a head.  The back of the head  turned 
and the visage of the Spook stared at them both.  It was an eerie 
feeling  and  Scott  shuddered as the  disembodied  head  stopped 
spinning. 

"Take a look at this," Vinnie said as he continued typing.  Scott 
watched  the head, Spook's head, come alive.  The lips were  mov-
ing,  as  though it, he, was trying to speak.  "I can give  it  a 
voice if you'd like."

"Will that help?" Scott asked.

"Nah, not in this case," Vinnie said,"but it is fun.  Let's  make 
sure  that we got the right guy here.  We'll take a look  at  him 
from  every angle."  The head moved to the side for a  left  pro-
file.  "I'll make a couple of gross adjustments, and you tell  me 
if it gets any better."

They  went  through  another hour of fine tuning  the  3-D  head, 
modifying  skin tones, texture, hair style and a score  of  other 
subtleties.   When they were done Scott remarked that  the  image 
looked more like the Spook than the Spook himself.    Incredible.  
Scott was truly impressed.  This is where taxpayer's money  went.  
Vinnie called Tyrone and by the time he arrived, the color photo-
graphs and digital maps of the images were ready.  

Scott followed Tyrone down one corridor, then another, through  a 
common area, and down a couple more hallways.  They entered  Room 
322B.  The innocuous appearance of the door did not prepare Scott 
for what he saw; a huge computer room, at least a football  field 
in  length.   Blue and tan and beige and a few black metal  cabi-
nets that housed hundreds of disparate yet co-existing computers.  
Consoles with great arrays of switches, row upon row of video and 
graphic  displays  as  far as the eye could  see.   Thousands  of  
white two by two foot square panel floors hid miles of wires  and 
cables  that interconnected the maze of computers in  the  under-
ground control center.  There appeared to be a number of discreet 
areas,  where large computer consoles were centered amidst  racks 
of  tape or disk drives which served as the only  separation  be-
tween workers.

"This is Big Floyd," Tyrone said proudly.  "Or at least one  part 
of him."

"Who or what is Big Floyd?"  

"Big Floyd is a huge national computer system, tied together over 
the Secure Automated Message Network.  This is the most  powerful 
computer facility outside of the NSA."

Quiet conversations punctuated the hum of the disk drives and the 
clicks  of solenoids switching and the printers pushing reams  of 
paper.  The  muted voices could not be understood but  they  rang 
with purpose.   The room had an almost reverent character to  it; 
where  speaking too loud would surely be considered  blasphemous.  
Scott  and  Tyrone walked through banks and banks  of  equipment, 
more computer equipment than Scott had ever seen in one location.  
In  fact the Federal Square computer center is on the  pioneering 
edge  of forensic technology. The NSA computers might  have  more 
oomph!, but the FBI computers have more purpose.

Tyrone stopped at one control console and asked if they could  do 
a   match,  stat.  Of course, anything for  Mr.  Duncan.  "RHIP," 
Tyrone  said.  Scott recognized the acronym, Rank Has Its  Privi-
lege.   Tyrone gave the computer operator the pictures and  asked 
him to explain the process to Scott.

"I take these pictures and put them in the computer with a  scan-
ner.  The digitized images are stored here," he said pointing  at 
a  a  rack of equipment. "Then, we enter  the  subject's  general 
description.  Height, physique and so on."  He copied the  infor-
mation into the computer. 

"Now we ask the computer to find possible matches."

"You  mean the computer has photos of everyone in  there?"  Scott 
asked incredulously.

"No,  Scott.  Just the bad guys, and people with security  clear-
ances,  and public officials?  Your Aunt Tillie is safe from  Big 
Brother's prying eyes."  The reason for Ty's sarcasm was clear to 
Scott.   Tyrone was not exactly acting in an official capacity on 
this part of the investigation.  

"How many do you have? Pictures that is?" Scott asked more diplo-
matically.

"That's classified," Tyrone said quickly.

"The hackers say you have files on over a hundred million people.  
Is that true?"  Scott asked.  Tyrone glared at him, as if to say, 
shut  the  fuck  up.   Scott took the non-verbal  hint  and  they 
watched in silence as the computer whirred searching for  similar 
photo  files in its massive memory.  Within a couple  of  minutes 
the computer said that there were 4 possible matches.  At the end 
of the 10 minute search, it was up to 16  candidates.   

"We'll  do  a visual instead of a second search,"  said  the  man 
behind  the keyboard.  "We'll start with the 90% matches.   There 
are  two of them."  A large monitor flashed with a picture  of  a 
man, that while not unlike the Spook in features, was  definitely 
not him.  The picture was a high quality color photograph.

"No,  not him," Scott said without pause.  The computer  operator 
hit a couple of keys, a second picture flashed on the monitor and 
Scott's face lit up.   "That's him! That's the Spook!"

Tyrone  had wondered if they would find any matches.   While  the 
FBI  data  base  was probably the largest in the  world,  it  was 
unlikely  that  there  was a comprehensive library  of  teen  age 
hackers.  "Are you sure?" Tyrone emphasized the word, 'sure'.  

"Positive, yes.  That's him."

"Let's  have a quick look at the others before we do a  full  re-
trieve," said the computer operator.  Tyrone agreed and  fourteen 
other pictures of men with similar facial characteristics to  the 
Spook  appeared  on the screen, all receiving a quick  'no'  from 
Scott.  Spook's picture as brought up again and again Scott said, 
"that's him."

"All  right, Mike," Tyrone said to the man running the  computer, 
"do a retrieve on OBR-III."  Mike nodded and stretched over to  a 
large printer on the side of the console.  He pushed a key and in 
a few seconds, the printer spewed out page after page of informa-
tion.   OBR-III  is a super-secret computer  system  designed  to 
fight  terrorism  in the United States.  OBR-III  and  Big  Floyd 
regularly  spoke  to similar, but smaller,  systems  in  England, 
France and Germany.  With only small bits of data it can extrapo-
late  potential terrorist targets, and who is the  likely  person 
behind  the  attacks.  OBR-III is an expert  system  that  learns 
continuously,  as  the human mind does.  Within  seconds  it  can 
provide information on anyone within its memory.

Tyrone  pulled  the  first page from the printer  before  it  was 
finished  and read to himself.  He scanned it quickly  until  one 
item  grabbed  his attention. His eyes widened.  "Boy,  when  you 
pick 'em, you pick 'em."  Tyrone whistled.  

"What, what?" Scott strained to see the printout, but Tyrone held 
it away.

"It's no wonder he calls himself Spook," Tyrone said to no one in 
particular.  "He's ex-NSA."  He ripped off the final page of  the 
printout  and called Scott to follow him, cursorily thanking  the 
computer operators for their assistance.

Scott  followed Tyrone to an elevator and they descended  to  the 
fifth  and  bottom  level, where Tyrone headed  straight  to  his 
office with Scott in tow.  He shut the door behind him and showed 
Scott a chair. 

"There's  no way I should be telling you this, but I owe  you,  I 
guess,  and,  anyway, maybe you can help."   Tyrone  rationalized 
showing the information to Scott - both a civilian and a  report-
er.   He  may  have questioned the wisdom, but  not  the  intent.  
Besides,  as  had been true for several weeks,  everything  Scott 
learned  from  Tyrone Duncan was off the record.  Way  off.   For 
now.

The  Spook's real name was Miles Foster. Scott scanned the  file.  
A  lot of it was government speak and security  clearance  inter-
views for his job at NSA.  An entire life was condensed into a  a 
few files, covering the time from when he was born to the time he 
resigned  from the NSA.  Scott found much of his life boring  and 
he really didn't care that Miles' third grade teacher  remembered 
him  as being a  "good boy".  Or that his high  school  counselor 
though he could go a long way.

"This  doesn't  sound like the Spook I know,"  Scott  said  after 
glancing at the clean regimented life and times of Miles Foster. 

"Did you expect it to?" asked Ty.

"I guess I never thought about it.  I just figured it would be  a 
regular guy, not a real spook for the government."  

"Shit happens."

"So I see.  Where do we go from here?" Scott asked in awe of  the 
technical capabilities of the FBI.

"How  'bout  a sanity check?" Tyrone asked.  "When  were  you  in 
Amsterdam?"

"Last week, why?"

Tyrone sat behind his computer and Scott noticed that his fingers 
seemed  almost  too fat to be of much good.  "If I can  get  this 
thing to work, let's see where's the Control Key?"   Scott  gazed 
on  as  Tyrone talked to himself while working the  keyboard  and 
reading  the screen.  "Foster, Airline, Foreign, ah, the  dates," 
he    looked    up   at   a   large    wall    calendar.     "All 
right . . .shit . . .Delete . . . OK, that's it."

"What are you doing?" asked Scott. 

"Just want to see if your boy really was in Europe with you."

"You don't believe me!" shouted Scott.

"No,  I believe you.  But I need some proof, dig?"  Tyrone  said.  
"If he's up to something we need to find out what, step by  step.  
You should know that."

"Yeah,  I do," Scott resigned.  "It's just that I'm not  normally 
the one being questioned. Know what I mean?"

"Our  training is more  . . .well, it's a moot point  now.   Your 
Mr. Foster flew to Amsterdam and then back to Washington the next 
day.  I believe I have some legwork ahead of me.  I would like to 
learn a little more about Mr. Miles Foster."

Scott  talked Tyrone into giving him a copy of one of the  images 
of  Miles  aka  Spook.  He was hoping that Kirk  would  call  him 
tonight.   In any case, Scott needed to buy an image  scanner  if 
Kirk  was going to be of help. When he got home, he made room  on 
his  personal nightmare, his desk, for the flatbed scanner,  then 
played  with it for several hours, learning how to scan an  image 
at the right sensitivity, the correct brightness and reflectivity 
for the proper resolution.  He learnd to bring a picture into the 
computer  and  edit  or redraw the picture.   Scott  scanned  the 
picture  of the Spook into the computer and enjoyed adding  mous-
taches, subtracting teeth and stretching the ears.

At  midnight,  on the button, Scott's computer  beeped.   It  was 
Kirk.

WTFO

You got my message.

SUBTLETY IS NOT YOUR STRONG POINT

I didn't want to miss.

GOTCHA.  YOU RANG.

First of all, I want a better way to contact you, since I  assume 
you won't tell me who you are.

RIGHT! AND I'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT.  CALL 212-555-3908.  WHEN YOU 
HEAR  THE  BEEP, ENTER YOUR NUMBER.  I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON  AS  I 
CAN.

So you're in New York?

MAYBE.  MAYBE NOT.

Ah,  call forwarding.  I could get the address of the  phone  and 
trace you down.

I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT.

And why not may I ask?

CAUSE WE HAVE A DEAL.

Right.  You're absolutely right.

NOW THAT I'M RIGHT, WHAT'S UP?

I met with the Spook.

YOU DID????????

The  conference  was great, but I need to know more.   I've  just 
been  sniffing around the edges and I can't smell what's  in  the 
oven.

WHAT ABOUT THE SPOOK?  TELL ME ABOUT IT. 

I have picture of him for you.  I scanned it.

VERY GOOD, CLAP, CLAP.  

I'll send you SPOOK.PIX.  Let me know what you think.

OK.  SEND AWAY.

Scott  chose the file and issued the command to send it to  Kirk.  
While  it was being sent they couldn't speak, and  Scott  learned 
how  long it really takes to transmit a digital picture  at  2400 
baud.   He got absorbed in a magazine and almost missed the  mes-
sage on the computer. 

THAT'S NOT THE SPOOK!!!!

Yes it is.  I met him.

NO, IT'S NOT THE REAL SPOOK.  I'VE MET HIM.  HE'S PARTIALLY  BALD 
AND HAS A LONG NOSE AND GLASSES.  THIS GUY'S A GQ MODEL

C'mon,  you've got to be putting me on.  I travel 3000 miles  for 
an impostor?

I GUESS SO.  THIS IS NOT THE SPOOK I KNOW.

Then who is it?

HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

Just thought I'd ask . . .

WHAT'S GOING ON REPO?

Deep shit, and I need your help.

GOT THE MAN LOOKING OVER YOUR DONKEY?

No,  he's  not here, honest.  I have an idea,  and  you're  gonna 
think  it's nuts, I know.  But I have to ask you for a couple  of 
favors.

WHAT MAY THEY BE?

The  Freedom League.  I need to know as much about it as  I  can, 
without  anyone  knowing that I want the  information.   Is  that 
possible?

OF COURSE.  THEY'RE BBS'ERS.  I CAN GET IN EASY.  WHY?

Well that brings up the second favor.  dGraph.  Do you own it?

SURE, EVERYONE DOES.  LEGAL OR NOT.

Can't you guys take apart a program to see what makes it tick?

REVERSE ENGINEERING, YEAH

Then I would like to ask if you would look at the dGraph  program 
and see if it has a virus in it?

     No Privacy for Mere Citizens
     by Scott Mason.

I learned the other day, that I can find out just about  anything 
I  want to know about you, or her, or him, or anyone, for  a  few 
dollars, a few phone calls and some free time.

Starting  with just an automobile license plate number,  the  De-
partment of Motor Vehicles will be happy to supply me with a name 
and address that go with the plate.  Or I can start with a  name, 
or  an address or just a phone number and use a  backwards  phone 
book.  It's all in the computer.

I  can  find more about you by getting a copy of  the  your  auto 
registration  and  title  from the  public  records.     Marriage 
licenses  and divorces are public as well. You can find  out  the 
damnedest things about people from their first or second or third 
marriage records.  Including the financial settlements.  Good way 
to determine how much money or lack thereof is floating around  a 
healthy divorce.

Of course I can easily find all traffic offenses, their  disposi-
tion,  and any follow up litigation or settlements.  It's all  in 
the computer.  As there are public records of all arrests,  court 
cases, sentences and paroles.  If you've ever been to trial,  the 
transcripts are public.  

Your  finances can be scrupulously determined by looking  up  the 
real  estate records for purchase price, terms, cash,  notes  and 
taxes  on your properties.  Or, if you've ever had a  bankruptcy, 
the  sordid details are clearly spelled out for anyone's  inspec-
tion.  It's all in the computer.

I  can  rapidly build an excellent profile of you,  or  whomever. 
And,  it's legal.  All legal, using the public records  available 
to anyone who asks and has the $2.  

That tells me, loud and clear, that I no longer have any privacy!  
None!

Forget  the hackers; it's bad enough they can get into  our  bank 
accounts  and our IRS records and the Census forms that have  our 
names  tied to the data.  What about Dick and Jane Doe,  Everyman 
USA,  who can run from agency to agency and office to office  put 
together enough information about me or you to be dangerous.

I do not think I like that.  

It's  bad  enough the Government can create us or destroy  us  as 
individuals  by altering the contents of our computer files  deep 
inside the National Data Bases.  At least they have a modicum  of 
accountability.   However,  their inattentive disregard  for  the 
privacy of the citizens of this country is criminal.  

As  a reporter I am constantly amazed at how easy it is  to  find 
out  just  about anything about anybody, and in  many  ways  that 
openness  has made my job simpler.  However, at the same time,  I 
believe  that  the Government has an inherent  responsibility  to 
protect  us  from invasion of privacy, and they are  derelict  in 
fulfilling that promise.

If the DMV needs to know my address, I understand.  The IRS needs 
to  know  my income.  Each computer unto itself  is  a  necessary 
repository  to facilitate business transactions.   However,  when 
someone  begins  to investigate me, crossing  the  boundaries  of 
multiple  data  bases,  without question, they  are  invading  my 
privacy.  Each piece of information found about me may be  insig-
nificant in itself, but when combined, it becomes highly  danger-
ous  in the wrong hands.  We all have secrets we want  to  remain 
secrets.  Under the present system, we have sacrificed our priva-
cy for the expediency of the machines.

I have a lawyer friend who believes that the fourth amendment  is 
at stake.  Is it, Mr. President?

This is Scott Mason, feeling Peered Upon.

     Wednesday, January 13
     Atlanta, Georgia

First  Federal Bank in Atlanta, Georgia enjoyed a  reputation  of 
treating  its customers like royalty.  Southern  Hospitality  was 
the  bank's  middle  name and the staff was  trained  to  provide 
extraordinary  service.   This morning  though,  First  Federal's 
customers  were not happy campers.  The calls started  coming  in 
before 8:00 A.M.

"My  account  is off $10,"  "It doesn't add up,"   "My  checkbook 
won't balance."  A few calls of this type are normal on any given 
day,  but the phones were jammed with customer complaints.   Hun-
dreds of calls streamed in constantly and hundreds more never got 
through  the  busy signals.  Dozens of customers  came  into  the 
local branches to complain about the errors on their statement.

An  emergency meeting was held in the Peachtree Street  headquar-
ters  of  First Federal.  The president of the bank  chaired  the 
meeting.   The basic question was, What Was Going On?  It  was  a 
free for all.  Any ideas, shoot 'em out.  

How  many calls?  About 4500 and still coming in.  What  are  the 
dates of the statements?  So far within a couple of days, but who 
knows what we'll find.  What are you asking people to do?  Double 
check  against their actual checks instead of the  register.   Do 
you  really  think that 5000 people wake up one morning  and  all 
make  the  same mistakes?  Do you have any  other  ideas?    Then 
what?   If they don't reconcile, bring 'em in and we'll pull  the 
fiche.

What  do  the computer people say?  They think there  may  be  an 
error.  That's bright. If the numbers are adding up wrong, how do 
we  balance?   Have no idea.  Do they add up in our  favor?   Not 
always. Maybe 50/50 so far.  Can we fix it?  Yes.  When?  I don't 
know yet.  Get some answers.  Fast.  Yessir.

The  bank's  concerns mounted when their larger  customers  found 
discrepancies in the thousands and tens of thousands of  dollars.  
As  the number of complaints numbered well over 10,000  by  noon, 
First Federal was facing a crisis.  The bank's figures in no  way 
jived  with  their  customer's records and  the  finger  pointing 
began. 

The  officers  contacted the Federal Reserve Board  and  notified 
them.  The Board suggested, strongly, that the bank close for the 
remainder of the day and sort it out before it got worse.   First 
Federal  did close, under the guise of installing a new  computer 
system,  a  lie  that might also cover whatever  screwed  up  the 
statements.   Keep  that option open.  They  kept  answering  the 
phones,  piling up the complaints and discovering that  thus  far 
there was no pattern to the errors.

By mid-afternoon, they at least knew what to look for.  On  every 
statement a few checks were listed with the incorrect amounts and 
therefore the balance was wrong.  For all intent and purpose, the 
bank had absolutely no idea whose money was whose.  

Working into the night the bank found that all ledgers  balanced, 
but  still the amounts in the accounts were wrong.  What are  the 
odds of a computer making thousands of errors and having them all 
balance  out  to  a net zero difference?   Statistically  it  was 
impossible,  and that meant someone altered the amounts  on  pur-
pose.   By midnight they found that the source of the  error  was 
probably  in  the control code of the  bank's  central  computing 
center.

First  Federal Bank did not open for business Thursday.  Or  Fri-
day.

First  Federal Bank was not the only bank to experience  profound 
difficulties with it's customers.  Similar complaints closed down 
Farmer's  Bank  in Des Moines, Iowa, Lake City Bank  in  Chicago, 
First  Trade  in New York City, Sopporo Bank  in  San  Francisco, 
Pilgrim's Trust in Boston and, as the Federal Reserve Bank  would 
discover, another hundred or so banks in almost every state.

The  Department  of the Treasury reacted  quickly,  spurred  into 
action by the chairman of Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C.   
Being  one of the oldest banks in the country, and the  only  one 
that  could claim having a personal relationship  with  Alexander 
Hamilton,  the first Secretary of the Treasury, it still  carried 
political weight. 

The evening network and local news stations covered the situation 
critically.  Questions proliferated but answers were hard to come 
by.   The largest of the banks and the government announced  that 
a major computer glitch had affected the Electronic Funds  Trans-
fers which had inadvertently caused the minor inconsistencies  in 
some customer records.  

The press was extremely hard on the banks and the Fed Reserve and 
the  Treasury.  They smelled a coverup, a lie; that they and  the 
public  were  not being told the truth, or at least  all  of  it.  
Only Scott Mason and a couple of other reporters speculated  that 
a  computer  virus  or time bomb was  responsible.   Without  any 
evidence  though, the government and the banks vigorously  denied 
any  such  possibilities.  Rather, they  developed  a  convoluted 
story  of  how  one money transaction affects  another  and  then 
another.   The  domino  theory of banking was  explained  to  the 
public in graphs and charts, but an open skepticism prevailed.  

Small  businesses and individual banking customers  were  totally 
shut off from access to their funds.  Tens of thousands of  auto-
matic  tellers were turned off by their banks in the futile  hope 
of minimizing the damage.  Estimates were that by evening, almost 
5 million people had been estranged from their money.

Rumors of bank collapse and a catastrophic failure of the banking 
system  persisted.   The  Stock Market, operating  at  near  full 
capacity  after November's disaster, reacted to the news  with  a 
precipitous drop of almost 125 points before trading was suspend-
ed, cutting off thousands more from their money.

The International Monetary Fund convened an emergency meeting  as 
the  London  and Tokyo stock markets reacted  negatively  to  the 
news.   Wire transfers and funds disbursements were ceased across 
all state and national borders. 

Panic ensued, and despite the best public relations efforts,  the 
Treasury imposed financial sanctions on all savings and  checking 
accounts.  If the banks opened on Friday, severe limits would  be 
placed on access to available funds.  Checks would be returned or 
held until the emergency was past.

Nightline  addressed  the banking crisis in depth.   The  experts 
debated the efficiency of the system and that possibly an unfore-
seen overload had occurred, triggering the events of the day.  No 
one suggested that the bank's computers had been compromised.

     New York City Times

"Yes, it is urgent."

"What is this about?

"That is for the Senator's ears only."

"Can you hold for . . ."

"Yes, yes. I've been holding for an hour.  Go on."  Muzak  inter-
pretations  of Led Zeppelin greeted Scott Mason as he was put  on 
hold.  Again.  Good God!  They have more pass interference in the 
front office and on the phones than the entire NFL.  He waited.

At long last, someone picked up the other end of the phone. "I am 
sorry  to keep you waiting, Mr. Mason, it has been rather  hectic 
as  you can imagine.  How are you faring?"  Senator  Nancy  Deere 
true to form, always projected genuine sincerity.

"Fine,  fine,  thank  you, Senator.  The reason for  my  call  is 
rather, ah . . .sensitive."

"Yes?" she asked politely.

"Well,  the  fact is, Senator, we cannot discuss it, that  is,  I 
don't feel that we can talk about this on the phone."

"That makes it rather difficult, doesn't it," she laughed weakly.

"Simply put, Senator . . . "

"Please call me Nancy.  Both my friends and enemies do."

"All right, Nancy,"  Scott said awkwardly.  "I need 15 minutes of 
your  time  about a matter of national security and  it  directly 
concerns  your work on the Rickfield Committee."  She  winced  at 
the  nick  name that the hearing had been given.  "I  can  assure 
you, Senator, ah, Nancy, that I would not be bothering you unless 
I was convinced of what I'm going to tell you.  And show you.  If 
you think I'm nuts, then fine, you can throw me out."

"Mr. Mason, that's enough," Nancy said kindly.  "Based upon  your 
performance at the hearing the other day, that alone is enough to 
make me want to shake your hand.  As for what you have to say?  I 
pride myself on being a good listener.  When would be  convenient 
for you?"

"The  sooner the better," Scott said with obvious relief that  he 
hadn't had to sell her.

"How's  . . .ah, four tomorrow?  My office?"

"That's fine, perfect.  We'll see you tomorrow then."

"We?" Nancy picked up the plural reference. 

"Yes,  I am working with someone else. It helps if I'm not  crazy 
alone."

"I'll  be  in Washington tomorrow, we can talk  about  it  then,"  
Tyrone Duncan said emphatically into his desk telephone.

"Ty,  I've  been on your side and defended you since  I  came  on 
board,  you know that."  Bob Burnson was pleading with Ty.   "But 
on  this one, I have no control.  You've been poking  into  areas 
that don't concern you, and I'm catching heat."

"I'm working on one damn case, Bob.  One.  Computer crime. But it 
keeps on touching this fucking blackmail fiasco and it's  getting 
on  everyone's nerves.  There's a lot more to this  than  ransoms 
and hackers and I've been having some luck.  I'll show you what I 
have tomorrow. Sixish.  Ebbets."

"I'll  be  there. Ty," Burnson said kindly.  "I  don't  know  the 
specifics,  but you've been shaking the tree.  I hope it's  worth 
it."

"It is, Bob.  I'd bet my ass on in."

"You are."

     Thursday, January 14
     Walter Reed Medical Center

"How is he doing?"  Scott asked.

"He's  not  out of the woods yet,"  said Dr. Sean Kelly,  one  of 
Walter  Reed's hundreds of Marcus Welby look-alike  staff  physi-
cians.   "In cases like this, we operate in the dark.  The  chest 
wound  is nasty, but that's not the danger; it's the head  wound. 
The brain is a real funny area."

Tyrone's FBI identification was required to get him and Scott  in 
to see Dr. Kelly.  As far as anybody knew, Pierre Troubleaux  had 
been  killed  over the weekend in an explosion  in  his  hospital 
room.    The explosion was faked at the suggestion of the manage-
ment  of  dGraph, Inc. after Pierre's most recent  assailant  was 
murdered, despite the police assigned to guard his room.   Two of 
Ahmed's elite army had disguised themselves as orderlies so  well 
that  they  weren't suspected when one went in the room  and  the 
other occupied the guard.   The media was having a field day.

All  would have gone as planned but for the fact that one of  the 
D.C.  policeman  on  guard was of Lebanese  decent.   One  ersatz 
orderly  emerged  from the room and spoke to his  confederate  in 
Arabic.   "It's done.  Let's get out of here."

The  guard understood enough Farsi and instantly drew his gun  on 
the pair.  One of Ahmed's men tried to pull his gun but was  shot 
and  wounded before he could draw.  The other orderly started  to 
run down the hallway pushing nurses and patients out of his  way.  
He slid as he turned left down another corridor that ended with a 
huge  picture window overlooking the lush hospital  grounds.   He 
never  slowed, shouting "Allah, I am yours!" as he  dove  through 
the  plate  glass window plummeting five floors to  the  concrete 
walk below.  

The  wounded and armed orderly refused to speak.  At all.   Noth-
ing. He made his one call and remained silent thereafter.

The  dGraph management was acutely concerned that there might  be 
another attempt on Pierre's life, so the secrecy surrounding  his 
faked  death  would be maintained until he was strong  enough  to 
deal  with the situation on his own. The investigation into  both 
the shooting and the meant-to-convince bombing was handled by the 
District  Police, and officially the FBI had nothing to  do  with 
it.

Dr.  Kelly  continued,  trying to  speak  in  non-Medical  terms.  
"Basically,  we don't know enough to accurately predict  the  ef-
fects  of trauma to the brain.  We can generally say  that  motor 
skills,  or memory might be affected, but to what extent  is  un-
known.  Then there are head injuries that we can't fully explain, 
and Pierre's is one of them."

Scott and Ty looked curiously at Dr. Kelly.  "Pierre had a severe 
trauma  to  the cranium, and some of the outer  layers  of  brain 
tissue were damaged when the skull was perforated."  Scott  shud-
dered  at  the distinct memory of the gore.  "Since he was  in  a 
coma,  we elected to do minimal repair work until he gained  con-
sciousness and he could give us first hand reports on his  memory 
and  other  possible effects. That's how we do it  in  the  brain 
business."

"So, how is he?"  Scott wanted a bottom line.

"He came out of a coma yesterday, and thus far, we can't find any 
problems that stem from the head injury."

"That's amazing," said Scott.  "I saw the . . ."

"It  is  amazing,"  agreed Dr. Kelly,  "but not  all  that  rare.  
There  are many references in the literature where  severe  brain 
damage was sustained without corresponding symptoms.  I once  saw 
a  half inch re-bar go through this poor guy's forehead.  He  was 
still  awake!  We operated, removed the bar, and when he woke  up 
he was hungry.  He had a slight a headache.  It was like  nothing 
ever happened.  So, who knows?  Maybe we'll be lucky."

"Can  we  see  him?"  Scott asked the Irish  doctor  assigned  to 
repair Pierre Troubleaux.

"He's  awake, but we have been keeping him sedated, more  to  let 
the chest wound heal than his head," Dr. Kelly replied.  

Pierre was recuperating in a virtual prison, a private room  deep 
within  the  bowels of the Medical Center.  There were  2  guards 
outside  the  room and another that sat near  the  hospital  bed.  
Absolute  identification was required every time someone  entered 
the room and it took two phone calls to verify the identities  of 
Scott  and Tyrone despite the verbal affidavit from Kelly.    The 
groggy  Pierre was awake when the three approached the bed.   Dr. 
Kelly  introduced  them and Pierre immediately tried to  move  to 
thank Scott for saving his life.  

Dr. Kelly laid down the rules; even though Pierre was in remarka-
bly good shape, still, no bouncing on the bed and don't drink the 
IV fluid.  Pierre spoke quietly, but found at least a half  dozen 
ways  to  thank Scott for his ad hoc heroics.  He  also  retained 
much of his famed humor.

"I  want  to thank you," Pierre said in jest,  "for  putting  the 
value of my life in proper perspective."

Scott's  cheeks  pushed up his glasses from the deep  smile  that 
Pierre's  words caused.  He hadn't realized that Pierre had  been 
conscious.  Tyrone looked confused.  

"I  begged him not to die," laughed Scott,  "because it  wouldn't 
look good on my resume."  

"And I have had the common courtesy to honor your request."

After suffering enough embarrassment by compliments, Scott  asked 
Pierre  for  a favor, to which he readily agreed.  No  long  term 
karmic debt here, thought Scott.

"I  need  to understand something," said Scott.   Pierre  nodded, 
what?

"You  told me, in the midst of battle, that dGraph was  sick.   I 
took  that to mean that it contained a virus of some  kind,  but, 
well, I guess that's the question.  What did you mean?"

"You're right. Yes," Pierre said softly but firmly.  "That's what 
I was going to say at the hearings.  I was going to confess."

"Confess?" Tyrone asked.  "To what?"

"To  the viruses.  About why I did it, or, really, why I  let  it 
happen."

"So you did infect your own software. Why?" Scott demanded.

Pierre  shook his head back and forth.  "No, I didn't do it.    I 
had no control."

"Then who did?"

"Homosoto and his people."

"Homosoto?   Chairman  of OSO?" Scott shrieked.  "You're  out  of 
your mind, no offense."

"I wish I were.  Homosoto took over my company and killed Max."

     The New Senate Office Building
     Washington, D.C.

"The  Senator  will  see you now," said one  of  Senator  Deere's 
aides.   Scott and Tyrone entered her office which was  decorated 
more  in line with a woman's taste than the heavy  furniture  men 
prefer.  She stood to greet them.

"Gentlemen," Nancy Deere said shaking their hands.  "I know  that 
you're  with  the New York City Times,  Mr. Mason.   I  took  the 
liberty  of reading some of your work.   Interesting,  controver-
sial.  I like it."  She offered them chairs at an informal  seat-
ing area on one end of the large office.  

"And you are?" she said to Ty.  He told her.  "I take it this  is 
official?"  

"At  this point ma'am, we just need to talk, and get  your  reac-
tions," Ty said.  

"He's having labor management troubles."  Scott thought that  was 
the perfect diplomatic description. 

"I   see,"  Nancy  said.   "So  right  now  this  meeting   isn't 
happening."

"Kind of like that," Ty said.

"And him?" She said cocking her head at Scott.

"It's his story, I'm just his faithful sidekick with a few of the 
pieces."

"Well then," Nancy said amused with the situation. "Please, I  am 
all ears."  She and Tyrone looked at Scott, waiting.  

How  the hell was he going to tell a U.S. Senator that an  organ-
ized  group of anarchistic hackers and fanatic Moslem Arabs  were 
working  with  a respected Japanese  industrialist  and  building 
computer  viruses.   He couldn't figure out any eloquent  way  to 
say  it, so he just said it, straight, realizing that the  summa-
tion sounded one step beyond absurd. All things considered, Scott 
thought, she took it very well.  

"I  assume  you have more than a headline?"  Senator  Deere  said 
after a brief, polite pause.

Scott  proceeded to describe everything that he had learned,  the 
hackers,  Kirk,  Spook,  the CMR equipment,  his  articles  being 
pulled, the First State and Sidneys situation.  He told her about 
the  anonymous  documents  he had thus far been  unable  to  use.  
Except  for one which he would use today.  Scott also  said  that 
computer viruses would fully explain the banking crisis.

Tyrone outlined the blackmail cases he suspected were  diversion-
ary  tactics for another as yet unknown crime, and  that  despite 
more  than $40 millions in payoffs had been arranged, no one  had 
showed to collect.  

"Ma'am," Tyrone said to Senator Deere.  "I fought to get into the 
Bureau,  and  I  made it through the good and the  bad.   And,  I 
always knew where I stood.  Akin, I guess to the political  winds 
that  change every four years."  She nodded.  "But  now,  there's 
something  wrong."  Nancy tilted her head waiting for Ty to  con-
tinue.

He  spoke carefully and slowly.  "I have never been the  paranoid 
type; I'm not conspiracy minded.  But I do find it strange that I 
get so much invisible pressure to lay off a case that appears  to 
be  both global in its reach and dangerous in its effects.   It's 
almost like I'm not supposed to find out what's happening.  I get 
no  cooperation  from  my upstairs, CI, the CIA.   NSA  has  been 
predictably obnoxious when I started asking questions."

"So why come to me?"  Nancy asked.  "You're the police."

"Are  you  aware that Pierre Troubleaux is  alive?"  Scott  asked 
Nancy, accidentally cutting off Tyrone.

"Alive?   How's  that possible?"   She too, had heard  the  news. 
They  told her they had spoken to Pierre and that his  death  had 
been  a ruse to protect him.  The reports on  Pierre's  prognosis 
brightened Nancy attitude.

"But, it's not all good news.  It appears, that every single copy 
of dGraph, that's a . . ."

"I  know  dGraph,"  she said quickly.  "It's  part  of  the  job.  
Couldn't live without it."

"Well,  ma'am, it's infected with computer viruses.  Hundreds  of 
them.   According  to Pierre, the head of  OSO  Industries,  Taki 
Homosoto,  had  Max Jones, co-founder of dGraph  killed  and  has 
effectively held Pierre hostage since."

The  impact of such an overwhelming accusation  defied  response.  
Nancy  Deere's  jaw fell limp.  "That is the  most  unbelievable, 
incredible . . .I don't know what to say."

"I have no reason not to believe what Pierre is saying. Not yet," 
said Tyrone.  

"There are a few friends of mine working to see if dGraph  really 
is  infected." Scott whistled to indicate the seriousness of  the 
implications.  

"What,  Mr.  Mason, what if it is?"  She thirsted for  more  hard 
information.

"I'm no computer engineer, Senator, er, Nancy, but I'm not stupid 
either.   Pierre  said that at least 500 different  viruses  have 
been installed in dGraph since Homosoto took over.  A rough guess 
is that there are over four million copies of dGraph.  Legal ones 
that  is.   Maybe double that for pirated copies."   Nancy  main-
tained  rapt attention as Scott continued .  "Therefore, I  would 
venture that at least eight to ten million computers are  infect-
ed."

Scott paused as Nancy's eyes widened. 

"Knowing  that  viruses  propagate from one  program  to  another 
according  to  specific rules, it would not  be  unreasonable  to 
assume  that almost every micro-computer in the United States  is 
getting  ready  to  self destruct."  Scott  sounded  certain  and 
final.  

"I can't comprehend this, this is too incredible." Senator  Deere 
shook her head in disbelief.  "What will happen?"

"Pierre doesn't know what the viruses do, he's not a  programmer. 
He's  just  a  figurehead," Scott explained. "Now, if  I  had  to 
guess,  I  would, well, I would do everything  possible  to  keep 
those viruses from exploding."

"One man's word is an indictment, not a conviction,"  Nancy  said 
soberly.

"There's more,"  Tyrone said, taking some of the onus off  Scott. 
"We've learned quite a bit in the last few days, Senator, and  it 
begins  to  pull some of the pieces together, but not  enough  to 
make  sense of it all."  He slid forward in his chair.  "We  know 
that Scott's hacker's name is Miles Foster and he's tied up  with 
the Amsterdam group, but we don't how yet.  We also know that  he 
is ex-NSA and was a communications and security expert out at the 
Fort."  Nancy understood the implication.  

"When  I  asked for information on Foster from NSA I  was  stone-
walled.   I  assume that I somehow pushed a button and  that  now 
they're retaliating.  But, for the life of me, I don't know why."  
Tyrone  shook  his  head in frustration.  "It  doesn't  make  any 
sense."

"At any rate," Tyrone said waving off the lack of cooperation, "I 
checked into his background since he left the Agency in '87.   He 
went  freelance, became a consultant, a Beltway  Bandit."   Nancy 
Deere  nodded that she understood but she listened with  a  poker 
face.  "We have him traveling to Japan shortly after his resigna-
tion,  and then several times over the next few months.   He  has 
been  to Japan a total of 17 times.  Since his credit cards  show 
no  major  purchases in Japan, I assume that  he  was  somebody's 
guest.   The  tickets purchased in his name were  bought  from  a 
Tokyo travel agency, but we can't determine who paid for them."

"Seventeen times?" asked the Senator.  

"Yes ma'am.  Curious."

"How do you know what he used his credit cards for, Mr.  Duncan?"  
she asked dubiously. 

"We have our means.  I can't get into that now."  Tyrone held the 
party  line  which meant not confirming or denying that  the  FBI 
could access any consumer and credit data base in the world.   In 
fact  though, the National Crime Information Center is linked  to 
hundreds  of computers world wide over the Computer  Applications 
Communications Network.  They can generate a complete profile  on 
any citizen within minutes of the request.  Including all travel, 
credit  card  and checking activities.  Scott found  this  power, 
entrusted to a few non-elected and non-accountable civil servants 
unconscionable.

"I have no doubt," she said caustically. 

"There's more."  Tyrone spoke without the benefit of notes  which 
impressed Nancy.  "The case concerning Max Jones' death is  being 
reopened.   It seems that the former Sheriff in San Mateo  county 
was  voted out and the new one is more than willing to assist  in 
making  his  predecessor  look bad."  Tyrone  spoke  without  the 
emotion that drove Scott.

"So what does this prove?" she asked.

"It  turns out that Homosoto was in Sunnyvale the day that  Jones 
died."

Nancy  Deere  sat in silence and stared out of the  window  which 
only  provided  a  view of another  office  building  across  the 
street.   Despondence veiled her normally affable countenance  as 
she grappled internally with the implications of the revelations.

"Senator,"  Scott  said as he handed her a file  labeled  General 
Young: GOVT-108.  "I was wondering if this might have any bearing 
on  the tone of the hearings?  It's pretty obvious that  you  and 
Rickfield don't see eye to eye."  

Nancy took the file cautiously, meeting Scott's eyes, looking for 
ulterior motives.  She found none and scanned the first page that 
described  the  illicit relationship between General   Young  and 
Senator Merrill Rickfield.  Her brow furrowed the more she read.  

"Is this confirmed?"  she asked quietly.

"No ma'am," Scott said.  "I read it this weekend and added up two 
and two and, well, it does raise some questions."

"I should say it does. Ones that I'm sure he will not be  anxious 
to answer."

     6 P.M., Washington, D.C.

"Who  the  hell are you pissing off and why?"   Bob  Burnson  met 
Tyrone and Scott at the Old Ebbett's Grill across the street from 
Treasury at 6:00 PM.  

Burnson  insisted that their conversation be off the record,  and 
reluctantly  accepted  that for Scott's  assistance  in  Tyrone's 
investigation he would get an exclusive. 

For a full half hour, Tyrone and Scott explained what they  knew, 
just  as they had to Senator Deere.  Tyrone had  other  problems.   
"I've been running into all sorts of bullshit here, CI, and don't 
forget our midnight rendezvous."

Burnson was a reasonable man, and had every reason, more than two 
decades  of reasons to believe the tale that Tyrone  was  telling 
him.   Yet,  at the same time, the story carried a  wisp  of  the 
implausible.   Hackers and Arabs?  But, then, why was he  getting 
heat that Ty was peeking under the wrong logs?

"What are you planning?" Bob asked them both.

"Scott's going after Homosoto," said Tyrone.  "See if he can  get 
a few answers."

"And," Scott added, "the Max Jones angle.  I'll be on that, too."

"Right.  As for me?" Tyrone asked.  "I sure would like to have  a 
chat  with Mr. Foster.  I can't imagine that he's squeaky  clean.  
There's no core, no substance, but a lot of activity, and I think 
it's about time to turn a few screws."

"Ty," Bob consoled,  "whoever's button you're pushing has  pushed 
the Director's, whose aides have been all over my ass like  stink 
on shit.  And that's exactly what this smells of.  From a politi-
cal  angle,  it reeks, and by all rights I should make  you  back 
off."  Burnson gestured at Scott.  "Then we'd have him doing  the 
work  while  our asses stay clean."  He referred to  Scott.    "A 
perfect case of CYA."

"But?"  Tyrone suggested.

"But,"  Bob  said,  "just because you're  paranoid  doesn't  mean 
someone's  not out to get you.  It smells like pure 100% Grade  A 
Government  approved horse shit here, but I'll be fucked if  know 
why  CI  is  such a problem.  They normally  love  the  espionage 
stuff."

"They  think  it's  a  crock. Said we  should  stick  to  tabloid 
crimes," Tyrone said defiantly.

"Unless," Scott thought out loud.  Ty and Bob stopped to  listen.  
"Unless, the NSA has something to hide about Miles Foster.  Could 
they exert that kind of pressure?"  He asked Bob.

"The  NSA can do almost anything it wants, and it has  tremendous 
political strength.  It's possible," Bob resigned.  "Listen, I'll 
cover you as long as I can, but, after that, it may get too thick 
for my blood.  I hope you understand."

"Yeah, I know.  I'll call you anyway. And, Bob?  Thanks."

     Friday, January 15
     New York City

Skyway-I helicopter flew down the East River at 5:30 A.M.  making 
the first of dozens of traffic reports that would continue  until 
10:00  A.M.  Jim Lucas flew during the A.M. and P.M.  rush  hours 
for  8  local stations and was regarded as the  commuters's  Dear 
Abby for driver's psychosis.  His first live-report did not  bode 
well;  the  FDR Drive was tied up very early; might  be  a  rough 
commute.

He crossed 42nd. St. heading west to the Hudson River and noticed 
that there were already two accidents; one at 5th. Avenue and one 
at  Broadway.  He listened in on the police band for  details  to 
pass on to his audience.

At  5:50 A.M., Skyway-I reported traffic piling up at  the  72nd. 
Street and Riverside Drive exit of the decrepit and ancient  West 
Side Highway.  And another accident on West End Avenue and  68th. 
Street.   Jim flew east across Manhattan to 125th.  Street  where 
the  Triborough  Bridge  dumps tens of thousands  of  cars  every 
morning  onto  southbound 2nd. Avenue.  Two more  accidents.   He 
listened  to  the police calls and heard them say  the  accidents 
were caused because all of the traffic lights were green.   

Every  traffic  light  in Manhattan was green  according  to  the 
police.  Jim reported the apparent problem on the air and as many 
accidents as he could; there were too many accidents to name.  He 
passed on the recommendations of the police:  Best Stay Home.

By  6:30 two additional helicopters were ordered to  monitor  the 
impending  crisis as the city approached real  gridlock.   Police 
helicopters  darted  about  while the media listened  in  on  the 
conversations from their police band radios.

At  7:00  the Traffic Commissioner was called at home,  and  told 
that  he  shouldn't bother trying to come to work.   The  streets 
were  at  a  standstill.  Thousands of extra  police  units  were 
dispersed  throughout the city in a dubious attempt to begin  the 
process of managing the snarl that engulfed the city.

Scott  Mason exited from the 43rd. Street and Vanderbilt side  of 
Grand Central Station and was met with a common sight - a massive 
traffic  jam.   He walked the one block to Fifth  Avenue  and  it 
gradually  dawned on him that traffic wasn't moving at  all.   At 
8:15  A.M. it shouldn't be that bad.  The intersection  at  Fifth 
was  crowded with cars aiming in every direction and  pedestrians 
nervously slipped in and around the chaos.

Scott walked the three blocks to the Times digesting the  effects 
of  the  city's  worst nightmare; the paralysis  of  the  traffic 
system.  At that thought his stomach felt like he had been thrown 
from an airplane.  The traffic computers.

* * * * *

     Washington, D.C.

Sonja  Lindstrom watched the New York based Today show  from  the 
kitchen counter in her upscale Reston, Virginia townhouse.   What 
a  mess, she thought.  She knew how bad traffic could be  in  New 
York  even  when the lights worked. A news  flash  pre-empted  an 
interview with Joan Embry from the San Diego Zoo.  Sonja  watched 
intently.   New York was entering panic mode, and  the  repercus-
sions would be world wide.  Especially with the banks closed.

The  New York radio stations linked up with the Emergency  Broad-
cast  System  so  they could communicate with  the  half  million 
drivers who had nowhere to go.  Bridges and tunnels into  Manhat-
tan were closed and cars and busses on major arteries were  being 
forced to exit onto side streets.  Schools, shops and  non-essen-
tial government services were shut down for the day. 

The  Governor of New York declared a state of emergency  and  the 
National  Guard  was called to assist the  local  police.   Sonja 
compared  New Yorkers' reactions to this crisis to the  way  they 
deal with a heavy snowfall when the city stops.  Pretty much like 
any  other  day.   No big deal, go to a bar, good  excuse  for  a 
party.  She giggled to herself as the phone rang.  

"Hello?"

"Good morning, Sonja?"

"Oh,  hi,  Stephanie.  Yeah.  Kind of early for you,  isn't  it?"  
Sonja sipped her coffee.

"It is, I know, but I had to call you," Stephanie said quickly.

"Something wrong?" Sonja asked.

"I  think  so,  maybe.  Wrong enough that I  had  to  tell  you."  
Stephanie  sighed  audibly. "You don't have to play up  to  Scott 
Mason any more.  I'm getting out."

"Out of what?"  Sonja said with confusion.

"I've learned a few things that I don't like, and I've kinda  got 
hung up on Miles, and, well, I feel funny about taking the  money 
anymore.  Especially since Miles doesn't know about the  arrange-
ments.  You know what I mean?"

"Yes.  With Scott it bothered me a little.  So I made  believe  I 
was  on  the Dating Game.  All expense paid  date."   Sonja  knew 
exactly what Stephanie meant.  Deep inside she had known that  at 
one point or another she would have to meet the conflict  between 
her  profession  and her feelings straight on and deal  with  it.  
She  had not suspected that it would be for passion, nor  because 
of one of her 'dates'.

"Besides," Sonja added, "I didn't need to push him into anything.  
He's  so  hung on this story that it's almost an  obsession  with 
him."

"That's good to know, I guess," Stephanie said vacantly until her 
thoughts  took form.   "Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't the  four 
of  us  get together sometime.  I'm sure the boys have a  lot  in 
common."

"Scott should be down tonight."

"That should be fine.  We were going to dinner anyway.  Maybe  we 
can put this behind us."

* * * * *

     New York City

The  traffic engineers frantically searched for the  reason  that 
the signals had all turned green.  They reinitialized the switch-
es  and  momentarily thousands of green lights  flashed  red  and 
yellow,  but  there was no relief from the  gridlock.    Computer 
technicians  rapidly determined that the processor  control  code 
was  'glitching',  as they so eloquently  described  the  current 
disaster.   A  global error, they admitted, but  correctable,  in 
time.   The  engineers  isolated the switching  zones  and  began 
manually  loading  the  software that  controlled  each  region's 
switches in the hope of piecing together the grid.

At  noon  the  engineers and technicians had  tied  together  the 
dozens  of  local switches into the network and watched  as  they 
synchronized  with each other.  The computers compare  the  date, 
the time, anticipated traffic flow, weather conditions and adjust 
the  light  patterns and sequences accordingly.   Twenty  minutes 
later,  just as system wide synchronization was  achieved,  every 
light  turned green again.  It was then that the  engineers  knew 
that  it  was  only the primary sync-control  program  which  was 
corrupted. 

The Mayor publicly commended the Traffic Commissioner for getting 
the  entire traffic light system back in operation by 2:00  P.M..  
The  official explanation was a massive computer  failure,  which 
was partially true.  Privately, though, Gracie Mansion instructed 
the  police  to find out who was responsible  for  the  dangerous 
software  and they in turn called the Secret Service.  The  media 
congratulated the NYPD, and the population of the City in  coping 
with the crisis.  To everyone's relief there were no deaths  from 
the  endless  stream of traffic accidents, but almost  a  hundred 
were  injured  seriously  enough to be  taken  to  the  hospital.  
Whoever  was responsible would be charged with  attempted  murder 
among other assorted crimes.  All they had to do was find him.

     New York City

Telephoning to another day is about as close to time travel as we 
will see for a century,  but that's how Scott felt when he called 
OSO  Industries in Tokyo.  Was he calling 17 hours into the  next 
day, or was he 7 hours and one day behind?  All he knew was  that 
he needed an international clock to figure out when to call Japan 
during  their business hours.  Once he was connected to  the  OSO 
switchboard,  he had to pass scrutiny by three  different  opera-
tors, one of them male, and suffer their terrible indignities  to 
the  English language.  He told Homosoto's secretary, whose  Eng-
lish  was  acceptable, that he was doing a story  on  dGraph  and 
needed a few quotes.   It must have been slow in Tokyo as he  was 
patched through almost immediately.

"Yes?"

"Mr. Homosoto?"

"Yes."

"This is Scott Mason, from the New York City Times.  I am calling 
from  New York.  How are you today?"

"Fine,  Mr. Mason.  How may I help you?"  Homosoto was  obviously 
the gratuitous sort when it came to the press.

"We  are  preparing  to run a story in  which  Pierre  Troubleaux 
accuses  you  of murdering his partner Max Jones.  He  also  says 
that  dGraph  software  is infected  with  destructive  programs.   
Would  you like to comment, sir?"  Scott asked as  innocently  as 
possible under the circumstances.

No answer.  

"Sir? Mr. Homosoto?"

"Yes?"

"We  are also interested in your relationship with Miles  Foster.  
Mr. Homosoto?"

"I have nothing to say."

"Are  you  financing  hackers and Arabs  to  distribute  computer 
viruses?"

No answer.

"Sir,  do  you know anything about a blackmail operation  in  the 
United States?"

"I should have killed him."

"What?" Scott strained his ear.

"Mr. Troubleaux is alive?"

"I  can't  answer  that.   Do  you  have  any  comment,  sir?  On 
anything?"

"I have nothing to say.  Good day."  The phone went dead.

Guilty as sin.  A non-denial denial.

     Saturday, January 16
     Tokyo, Japan

Dressed as business-like on the weekend as during the week,  Taki 
Homosoto  sat  at his regal techno-throne overlooking  the  Tokyo 
skyline from his 66th floor vista.  It was time.  Years of prepa-
ration  and  millions of dollars later, it was time.   Perhaps  a 
little earlier than he would have liked, but the result would  be 
the same anyway.

The  first call Homosoto made was to Ahmed Shah in  his  Columbia 
University  office.   Ahmed responded with his PRG  code  as  the 
computer requested.

     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>

GOOD YOU ARE THERE.

I can't get too far without my man-servant.  

I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE.  HE IS DEAD?

Yes.  It took two martyrs, one is being tortured by the FBI,  but 
he has Allah to guide him.

GOOD. CAN YOU DO MORE? 

I  am  at your disposal.  This is not the war I expected,  but  I 
serve  Allah's  will, and he is using you as  his  instrument  of 
revenge. 

THE  BANK CARDS.  THEY ARE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE TO  FUND  YOUR 
EFFORTS.  

You speak strangely.  Is something wrong?

NO,  EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO PLAN.  I EXPECT YOU WILL  FULFILL 
MY WISHES. 

Of course, that is the arrangement.  But what has changed?

NOTHING. I AM FULFILLING MY DESTINY.

As am I.

THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.

Alexander  Spiradon relaxed in his Alpine aerie home  overlooking 
the  hilly suburbs of Zurich while watching a satellite  feed  of 
the  Simpson's  on  his TV.  He found that  he  learned  American 
colloquialisms  best from American television.   They  brutalized 
the language under the guise of entertainment.  During a  commer-
cial  for  'The Quicker Picker Upper', his computer  announced  a 
call. 

He put the VCR on Quick-Record and sat at his Compaq Deskpro com-
puter watching the screen display the incoming identification. 

     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT CONVERSATION>>>>>>

          <<PRG RESPONSE?>>

Alex  entered the code displayed on his  personal  identification 
card.

          G4-YU7-%T64-666.009

          <<ACCEPTED>>

Alex  figured it was Homosoto since this was a very private  com-
puter.   His other computer, an AST 386SX with 330 MB of  storage 
was  the  one  his  recruits called with  reports.   The  25  Sir 
George's  of  his  army called twice a day.  Once  to  get  their 
assignments and once to send him the results of their efforts.

They  didn't have to call long distance, though, and  never  knew 
that Alex ran his part of Homosoto's operation from Europe.   Sir 
George and his hidden compatriots used their untraceable cellular 
phones  and merely called a local phone number within their  area 
code.   Alex's communications group had set up a  widely  diverse 
network  of call forwarding telephones to make tracing the  calls 
impossible.   They  exploited  all of the  common  services  that 
helped make his and Homosoto's armies invisible.  

MR ALEX.

Yes, sir.  

THE TIME HAS COME.  

So soon?

YES.  MONDAY IS GROUNDHOG DAY.

Monday? Are you sure?  With no warning?

HAVE I EVER BEEN WRONG?

No

THEN DO AS I SAY.  PLEASE.

Alex  started at the word 'please'.  He had never  seen  Homosoto 
ever use it before.

Of course.  As you wish.

WHAT ARE THE FIRST TARGETS OF THE GROUNDHOGS?

It is complex.

TELL ME!

The reservations systems of American, Delta, Pan Am and TWA.   It 
will shut down air travel for weeks.  

GOOD. AND?

The NBC, CBS and ABC communications computers.  We 
have  people working in each network.  Plus, we have  land  based 
transmitters  to garble and override network satellite  transmis-
sions.   Quite  a neat trick actually.  I'm  impressed  with  the 
technology.

I  DON'T  CARE ABOUT YOUR TECHNOLOGY.  I WANT TO KNOW  THAT  THEY 
WILL WORK. WHO ELSE?

The  list is long.  Groundhogs are at the Home Shopping  Network, 
American Express and other credit card companies.  The Center for 
Disease Control, Hospitals, the IRS, Insurance Companies.  Within 
a week, their computers will be empty and useless.  

THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. THIS ENDEAVOR HAS BEEN MOST PROFITA-
BLE FOR YOU, HAS IT NOT?

Very much so.  It is appreciated.

THEN YOU WILL NOT MIND IF I INCREASE YOUR PAYMENT.

No. Why? 

YOU  MUST  MAINTAIN THE SANCTITY OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS.  NO  MATTER 
WHAT HAPPENS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

Yes. I assume I ask no questions?

YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU SHOULD, BUT YOU ARE A MAN OF HONOR AS LONG 
AS I PAY THE MOST.  THAT IS TRUE.

At least you know where I stand.  

WILL YOU CONTINUE?  

Consider it done.  How much more?

ENOUGH.  MORE THAN ENOUGH.

He  couldn't believe it.  Scott had just watched  Nightline,  and 
who  was the guest?  Madonna.  How ridiculous.  She badly  needed 
English lessons not to mention a brain.  He was relieved when the 
call came.

WTFO?

I'm here, Kirk.  You're two minutes late.

PICKY PICKY.  

I  had to sit through a half hour of Madonna explaining  why  she 
masterbates on MTV.

LIFE'S A CESSPOOL.  THEN YOU DIE.

You sound happy tonight.

I'M NOT EXACTLY PLEASED, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

What have you got? 

WE'VE LEARNED A LOT.  FIRST OF ALL, DGRAPH IS INFECTED.

No shit.

PROFANITY.   BIG BROTHER AND FREEDOM ARE LISTENING.  REALLY.   WE 
FOUND  DOZENS OF DIFFERENT VIRUSES IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT  VERSIONS 
OF DGRAPH. SOMEONE PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO THIS.  I HAVE NEMO  AND 
EVERY  PHREAK  I KNOW WORKING ON IT TO SEE  WHAT  OTHER  VERSIONS 
THERE ARE.  AND I'M SURE THAT HALF THE HACKERS IN THE COUNTRY ARE 
DOING  THE SAME THING NOW.  WORD GETS AROUND. BUT THAT'S NOT  THE 
HALF OF IT.

Continue, oh messenger of doom.

THERE'S MORE ABOUT THE FREEDOM BOARDS. I  THOUGHT 
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN WHAT WE FOUND. 

I'm hanging on your every byte.

GOOD.   FIRST  OF ALL, I HAD NO IDEA HOW BIG THE  FREEDOM  LEAGUE 
WAS.  OVER 1600 MEMBER BBS'S HERE AND IN CANADA.

Is that large? 

THAT  MAKES THEM A FULL FLEDGED NATIONAL NETWORK.  ALMOST A  MIL-
LION  PEOPLE  BELONG.   BUT THE BEST PART?   THE  FREEDOM  LEAGUE 
SOFTWARE IS FILLED WITH VIRUSES TOO.

You've got to be kidding.  A million people in on it?

NO, NOT AT ALL.  COULD BE JUST A FEW.

A few?  How many are a few?

QUIET!   THE FREEDOM LEAGUE RUNS A SORT OF FRANCHISE SERVICE  FOR 
BBS'S.   THEY GIVE YOU ALL OF THE TOOLS AND TOYS AND SOFTWARE  TO 
HAVE  YOUR OWN FREEDOM LEAGUE BBS.  SO ANYONE WHO WANTS  TO,  CAN 
SET THEMSELVES UP FOR FREE.  FREEDOM GIVES THEM EVERYTHING BUT  A 
COMPUTER AND A MODEM.

And in exchange, they have to sell Freedom Software.

NOT  EXACTLY  SELL, SHAREWARE IS FREE TO DISTRIBUTE,   IN  THEORY 
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE MAY EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE INFECTIONS.  WHOEVER IS 
DESIGNING THE PROGRAMS HAS TO BE IN ON IT.  

And the franchisers, of course!  They set up their own  distribu-
tion of viruses.  

I WOULD GUESS THAT ABOUT 100 OF THE FREEDOM BBS'S KNOW ABOUT  THE 
INFECTIONS.

Why, how do you know that?

GOOD  GUESS.   WHEN FREEDOM STARTED UP BACK IN '88,  IT  HAD  100 
LOCATIONS.  

So it was staged, set up?

MUSTA  BEEN.  NOT CHEAP.  A GOOD BBS TAKES ABOUT $10,000  TO  GET 
GOING.  

A million bucks. Chump change.

FOR WHO?  

Just a friend.  What else?

THEY'VE DISTRIBUTED MILLIONS OF PROGRAMS.  MILLIONS.

Is every one infected?

I GUESS SO.  EVERY ONE WE'VE LOOKED AT IS.

Who else knows.

NEMO, PHREAK PHRIENDS.  IN A COUPLE OF DAYS YOU WON'T BE ABLE  TO 
GIVE FREEDOM AWAY.  IF IT'S INFECTED, WHICH IT IS, IT'S ALL  OVER 
FOR THEM.  THEIR REP IS SHOT.

Aren't you worried about a repeat performance on your computers? 

NO.  I  MOVED WHAT WAS LEFT OF MY EQUIPMENT AND  WE  SWITCHED  TO 
CELLULAR  CALL  FORWARDING.  CAN'T BE TRACED FOR  MONTHS.  BUT  I 
APPRECIATE THE CONCERN. 

I'll call you.  My main man is going to want to talk to you.

     dGRAPH INFECTED WITH VIRUS:  DGI OFFERS FREE UPGRADES.
     by Scott Mason

In an unprecedented computer software announcement, DGI President 
and  industry magnate Pierre Troubleaux admitted that every  copy 
of  dGraph  sold since late 1987 contains and  is  infected  with 
highly dangerous and contagious computer viruses.  

He  blamed  Taki Homosoto, chairman of OSO  Industries,  and  the 
parent  company of DGI for the viruses that Troubleaux said  were 
implanted on purpose.  

Mr. Homosoto had no comment on the allegations.

Since  there are so many different viruses present in the  dozens 
of  dGraph  versions, (Mr. Troubleaux estimates there may  be  as 
many  as 500) it is impossible to determine the exact  detonation 
dates  or  anticipated damage.  Therefore DGI  is  offering  free 
uninfected copies of  dGraph to every registered user.

Industry  reaction was strong, but surprisingly  non-critical  of 
DGI's  dilemma.   In general the reaction was one  of  shock  and 
disbelief.   "If this is true," said one source, "the  amount  of 
damage done will be incalculable."  He went on to say that  since 
the  virus problem has been largely ignored, very few  businesses 
have any sort of defensive measures in place.  Estimates are that 
large  companies  have  the most to lose when  the  dGraph  Virus 
explodes.

The  major software manufacturers came to DGI's  support  saying, 
". . .it was bound to happen sooner or later.  We're just glad it 
didn't  happen to us."   Leading software firms including  Micro-
soft,  Lotus, Computer Associates and Borland have offered  their 
disk  duplication and shipping facilities to assist DGI  in  dis-
tributing over four million copies of the program. 

Even with such support policies by DGI and the assistance of  the 
software industry, there is a great fear that the infected dGraph 
programs have communicated viruses to other programs and  comput-
ers.  According to Ralph Potter of the International Virus  Asso-
ciation,  "This  is a disaster of unfathomable  proportions.   It 
could not be much worse than if DOS had been carrying a virus for 
years.  The designers knew what they were doing, waiting so  long 
before the viruses were triggered to go off.  The ultimate Trojan 
Horse."

The  National Computer Systems Laboratory at the National  Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology issued a terse statement  saying 
that  they would soon publish recommended procedures to  minimize 
the effects of the current virus crisis.  They predicted at least 
2  millions personal computers would be stricken with the  dGraph 
Viruses. 

One  dGraph User Group in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has begun a  class 
action  suit against DGI and OSO on behalf of all users who  have 
damage done to their computers and or data.  They claim at  least 
10,000 co-plaintiffs on the initial filing with District Court in 
Milwaukee and are asking for $10 Billion in damages.

End.

Scott's story went on to describe that the FBI and Secret Service 
were taking the threat as a national security risk and would make 
a  public  statement in a day or so.  Leading  software  industry 
prophets were quoted, all taking credit for warning the  computer 
industry that such massive assaults were predictable and prevent-
able.  They blamed the government and computer manufacturers  for 
laxidazical  handling of a serious problem that could  have  been 
prevented.  Scott had to make a large chart to keep track of  the 
competitive finger pointing from the experts.

DGI's  stock fell 75% after the announcement until the  SEC  sus-
pended its trading.  

* * * * *

The Associated Press wire announcement was followed in seconds by 
the one from UPI.  Doug tore it off the printer and raced it over 
to Scott. 

"I believe this will be of interest to you . . ."  Doug  chuckled 
as Scott read the wire.

     Tokyo,  Japan:  Taki Homosoto, the billionaire  founder  and 
     chairman of OSO Industries, was found dead this afternoon in 
     his  opulent Tokyo office.  According to police and  company 
     spokespersons, Mr. Homosoto died by his own hands in  tradi-
     tional  Japanese warrior fashion; hari-kari.  His  body  was 
     found  curled  up in a pool of blood  with  the  ritualistic 
     sword  penetrating  his abdomen protruding  from  his  lower 
     back.  

     Police  say  they discovered a note on his person  that  ex-
     plained the apparent suicide. The letter is believed to have 
     been  hand  written by Mr. Homosoto.  The contents  of  that 
     letter, as released by the Tokyo police follow:

     Honorable  Friends, 

     I  now  resign as Chairman of OSO Industries.   My  time  is 
     over.

     For  almost 50 years I have waited to see the United  States      
     and its people suffer as my people did during those terrible  
     days in August.  The United States gave our people no  warn-
     ing,  and tens of thousands of innocent women  and  children 
     died  without purpose.  This criminal sin is one  which  the 
     United States and its people will have to live with for  all 
     eternity.

     Yet, out of compassion for the millions of innocent bystand-
     ers who are helplessly trapped by their government's  indif-
     ference  to  human life, I will give the American  people  a 
     warning: Without your computers your future is dim, and your 
     present becomes the past.

     When I was told about the attack plans on the United States, 
     I  admit that I was a willing but skeptical buyer.  I  found 
     it  hard  to believe, indeed incredible, that  the  greatest 
     military  power  on Earth was so foolish.   I  learned  that 
     there  were  no  defenses for the computers  that  run  your 
     country.  How unfortunate for you.

     It  was shown me how to execute the plans which  invade  the 
     very  bastions of Western Imperialism; and I have  succeeded 
     admirably.  You  will not recover for years, as we  did  not 
     after your hideous attack upon our land.

     By  the  time you read this, I will be dead and  happy.   My 
     creations  will have taken hold, and unshakeable from  their 
     roots, will spread chaos and distrust.  This is the  world's 
     first computer war and I have waged it and I will win it.  

     Retaliate!  Retaliate, if you wish, if you can; but you will 
     not,  you cannot. Who do you attack?  My country?  They  had 
     nothing  to  do with it.  My company?  I will  be  dead  and 
     there is no double jeopardy in death.

     You have nothing to say, and nothing to do in response.   As 
     we  did  not  after your fire-bombs landed.   We  could  say 
     nothing. 

     Helplessness  is a terrible feeling.  It is one  of  loneli-
     ness,  solitude in a personal hell which your  people  shall 
     suffer  as they learn to live without the luxuries of  tech-
     nology.  You will pay for your ancestor's mistakes.

     To the memory and honor of my family.

     Taki Homosoto

Scott Mason called Tyrone Duncan immediately.

"I  know,"  said Tyrone, sounding out of breath.  "We're  on  it.  
Pierre's  getting additional protection.  It turns out  that  Mr. 
Homosoto  isn't  as pure as the driven snow like he  pretends  to 
be."

"How do you mean?"  Scott asked.

"Off the record."

"Background."  The negotiation on press terms was complete.

"All  right, but be careful.  It seems that since the 1940's  Mr. 
Homosoto has been performing some very lucrative services for our 
friends  at  the Pentagon.  He has some  influential  friends  in 
Congress and uses an assortment of lobbying firms to promote  his 
interests."

"What's so unusual about that?" Asked Scott.

"Nothing, until you see that certain Congressmen got very wealthy 
when  OSO Industries built plants in their districts.  Heavy  PAC 
contributions, blind distribution of small contributing funds. It 
also  appears that he regularly entertained high  Pentagon  offi-
cials  in the finest fashion.  Paris, Tokyo, Rio, Macao.   Influ-
ence  pedaling and bribery.  We have traced a path from Tokyo  to 
the  Pentagon  that has resulted in  OSO  subsidiaries  receiving 
large  non-classified  government  contracts.   Take  dGraph  for 
example.  That's a de facto standard for all agencies."

"I never  thought  about that.  Everyone in the  government  uses 
     it."

"Just  like the private sector.  I'm on my way to have  a  little 
talk with your Mr. Foster.  I don't believe in coincidences."

"Good, where?" Asked Scott excitedly.

"Whoah!  Wait a minute.  This is official now, and I can't have a 
civilian . . ."

"Bullshit!"  Scott yelled into the phone.  "Don't you get  GI  on 
me.   I gave him to you.  Remember?  Besides, I know him.  And  I 
might have something else."

"What's that?"  

"What  if I told you that the Freedom League is part of it?   And 
that it's being run by foreign nationals."

"So what?" asked Tyrone.  

"How far did you check into the van driver's background?   Wasn't 
he Arab?"  Scott offered tidbits that he thought relevant.

"Yeah . . ."

"When are you meeting Foster?"

Tyrone thought carefully about Scott's words.  "Listen, I have to 
get  a  warrant  anyway.  It'll  probably  take  till  tomorrow."  
Tyrone  paused  for the subtle offer to sink in to  Scott.  "He's 
     listed.  Gotta go."

One hell of a guy, thought Scott.  If it ever got out that Tyrone 
worked with the media like this, he would be immediately retired, 
if not possibly prosecuted.  But nobody else was doing  anything, 
and  Scott had given them Foster on a silver platter.   He  would 
save the Freedom League story for the moment.

The  Motorola  STU-III secure phone rang on the  credenza  behind 
Marvin Jacobs desk.  He had been Director of the National Securi-
ty Agency, DIRNSA, since 1984, installed in that position because 
he  gave the distinct impression that he didn't care  about  any-
thing  except satisfying his mentor; in this case Vice  President 
Bush.  

The  STU-III phone added funny electronic effects to  the  voices 
that spoke over it; all in the interest of national security. 

"Hello?"  Jacobs asked.

"Homosoto is dead."

"I heard," Jacobs said.  "It sounded clean."

"Very pro.  Won't be a problem."

* * * * *

Scott saw the galley for the afternoon paper.  The headline, in 3 
inch letters shocked him:  

               RICKFIELD RESIGNS

He immediately called Senator Nancy Deere.

"I was going to call you," she said. "I guess you've heard."

"Yes, what happened?" He shouted excitedly over the rumble of the 
high speed train.

"I guess I should take the blame," Nancy said.  "When I confront-
ed the Senator this morning, he just stared at me.  Never said  a 
word.  I begged him for an explanation, but he sat there, expres-
sionless.  He finally got up and left."

"That's it?  What happens now?"

"I see the President," she said. 

"May I ask why?"

"Off the record," she insisted.  

"Sure." Scott agreed.  What's one more source I can't name. 

"I  heard about the resignation from the White House.  Phil  Mus-
grave.   He  said the President was very concerned and  wanted  a 
briefing  from my perspective.  He's beginning to feel some  heat 
on  the computer crimes and doesn't have a clue.  I  figure  they 
need to get up to speed real fast."

"It's  about time," Scott said out loud.  "They've been  ignoring 
this forever."

"And," Senator Deere added, "they want you there, too.  Tomorrow, 
9A.M."

The  hair  on Scott's neck stood on end.  A  command  performance 
from the White House?

"Why, why me?  

"You  seem  to know more than they do.  They think  you're  wired 
into the hackers and Homosoto."

"I'll be there," Scott managed to get out.  "What do I do . . .?"

"Call Musgrave's office at the White House."

"I bet the paper's going nuts.  I didn't tell them I had left  or 
where I was going," Scott laughed.  

Scott called Doug who had half of the paper looking high and  low 
for  him.  "You made the big time, huh kid?"  Doug said  feigning 
snobbery.   "What world shattering events precipitated this  mag-
nanimous call?"  In fact he was proud.  Very proud of Scott.  

Scott explained to Doug that he would call after the White  House 
meeting,  and  he wasn't quite sure why he was  going,  and  that 
Nancy was taking over the hearings and he would stay in DC for  a 
few  days.  And no, he wouldn't tell more than was in print,  not 
without calling Doug or Higgins - at any hour.

Doug sounded relieved when Scott volunteered that there would  be 
no hotel bills. Phew.  Forever the cheap skate.  The story of the 
year and he's counting pennies.  God, Doug was a good editor.

Scott's  stories  on computer crime and specifically  the  dGraph 
situation aroused national attention.  Time, Newsweek and  dozens 
of  periodicals began following the story, but Scott,  at  Doug's 
suggestion,  had wisely held back enough information  that  would 
guarantee the privacy and quality of his sources.  

He was right in the middle of it, perhaps making news as much  as 
reporting it, but with Doug's and the Times' guidance, Scott  and 
the  paper  were  receiving accolades on their  fair  yet  direct 
treatment of the issues.  

Doug  thought that Scott was perhaps working on the story of  the 
year,  or maybe the decade, but he never told him so.    However, 
Scott  was warned that as the story became major  national  news, 
the  exclusivity  that he and the Times had enjoyed would  be  in 
jeopardy.  Get it while the getting is hot.  

No problem.

It just so happened Scott knew Miles Foster personally.

* * * * * 

"Sonja?   I'm  coming down.  Tonight.  Can you recommend  a  good 
hotel?"   He jibed at her while packing away his laptop  computer 
for the trip to Washington.  He called her and was going to leave 
a  message,  but instead he was rewarded with her  answering  the 
phone.

"Chez Lindstrom is nice, but the rates are kind of high."  

"King or twin beds?  Room with a view?  Room service?"

"E,  all of the above," she laughed.  "Want me to pick you up  at 
National?"

"Naw,  I'll  take the train from work.  I may need to buy  a  few 
things  when I get there, like a suitcase and a  wardrobe.   It's 
kind of last minute."

"I gather I wasn't the prime reason for your sudden trip,"  Sonja 
said in fun. 

"No, it was, I wanted to come, but I had to do some . . .and then 
I found out about . . .well I have to be there tomorrow, but I am 
leaving a day early."  He pleaded for understanding, not  realiz-
ing  she was kidding him.  He couldn't tell her why he was  being 
so circumspect.  Nothing about the meeting.

"Well," she said dejectedly,  "I guess it's O.K.  If."

"If what?" Scott brightened.

"If  we  can have a couple of friends over for  dinner.   There's 
someone I'd like you to meet."

* * * * *

"Holy  shit," Scott said as Sonja opened her apartment  door  and 
admitted Miles and the stunning Stephanie.  

Miles stopped in his tracks and stared at Scott.  Then at Stepha-
nie.  "What's the deal?" he said accusingly.

"This  is Sonja Lindstrom and her friend Scott Mason,"  Stephanie 
said.  "What's wrong, hon?"  She still had her arm wrapped around 
Miles' arm.

"It's  just  that, well, we've met, and I was just kind  of  sur-
prised, that's all."  He extended a hand at Scott.  "Good to  see 
you again."   Scott warmly reciprocated.  This was going to be an 
interesting evening.

"Yeah,  ditto," Scott said, confused.  "What happened to you?   I 
thought you were coming back?"  He was speaking of Amsterdam.  

"Well, I was a little occupied, if you recall," Miles said refer-
ring  to the triplets in Amsterdam.  "And business forced  me  to 
depart earlier than I had anticipated."

"Where?  To Japan?"   Scott awaited a reaction by Miles, but  was 
disappointed when there was none. 

Stephanie and Sonja wondered how the two had already met; it  was 
their  job  to report such things to Alex, but it  really  didn't 
matter any more.  They were quitting.  

The  first round of drinks was downed quickly and the tension  in 
the room abated slightly.  The four spoke casually, albeit  some-
what  guardedly.  The harmless small talk was only a  prelude  to 
Scott's  question when the girls stepped into the kitchen.   Per-
haps they left the room on purpose.

"Listen,"  Scott  whispered urgently to Miles.  "I know  who  you 
are,  and  that  you're tied up with Homosoto  and  the  computer 
nutsiness  that's going on everywhere.  You have a lot of  people 
looking  for  you  and we only have a few  seconds,"  Scott  said 
glancing  up at the kitchen door.  "I see the situation  as  fol-
lows.  You get to tell your side of the story to the  authorities 
in  private, or you can tell me first and I put it in  tomorrow's 
paper.   This  may be your only chance to get your  side  of  the 
story  out.   All  of sudden, you're big news.  What'll  it  be?"  
Scott spoke confidently and waited for Miles' answer.  

Miles  intently  scanned  every inch of Scott's  face  in  minute 
detail.  "That fucking gook.  You're damn right I'll talk.  First 
of  all, it's a lie," Miles hissed.    "If they're  coming  after 
me,  I have to protect myself.  Can't trust a fucking slant  eye, 
can you?"

The  girls returned with fresh drinks and sat down on  the  white 
leather couch.  Miles and Scott continued their discussion.

"What happened?" Scott asked.  Miles looked over at the  stunning 
Sonja,  stripping her naked with his stare and then at  Stephanie 
who had caught his stare.

"It's very simple," Miles said after a while.  His dimples  deep-
ened   while he forced a smile.  "Homosoto's fucked us all."   He 
nodded  his  head  as he looked at his  three  companions.   "Me.  
Royally.   How the hell can I defend myself  against  accusations 
from the grave." He shrugged his shoulders.  "And you," he point-
ed  at  Scott.  "You've kept the fear going.  Haven't  you.   You 
picked up the scent and you've been writing about it for  months.  
Setting his stage for him.  Like a puppet.  And then?  After  you 
sensitize the public, he commits suicide.  He used you."

"And  then,  you two," Miles said to Stephanie and  Sonja.   "You 
could  be out in the cold in days.  Bet you didn't know you  were 
in on it.   Am I right?"  

"In on what?"  Scott asked Miles and Sonja.

"Tell him," Miles said to Sonja.  "I've never met you, but I  can 
guess what you do for a living."

"She's a PR person," interjected Scott.

"Go on, tell him, or I will," Miles said again.

Sonja's eyes pleaded with Miles to stop it.  Please, stop.   I'll 
do it in my own way, in time.  Please, stop.   Scott glowered  at 
Miles'  words  and awaited a response from Sonja.  How  could  he 
distrust her?  But what did Miles mean?

The front door bell rang and broke the intense silence.  It  rang 
again as Sonja went to answer.  

"Yes, he's here," she whispered.  

The door opened and Tyrone Duncan came into the room while anoth-
er man stood at the door.  Tyrone walked up to Miles.  Scott  was 
in absolute awe.  How the hell?  Ty had said tomorrow.

"Mr. Foster? Miles Foster?" Tyrone asked without pleasantries.

"Yeah,"  Miles said haughtily.

"FBI,"  Ty  said  flashing his badge. "You're  under  arrest  for 
trafficking  in stolen computer access cards and theft  of  serv-
ice."   Tyrone  took a breath and waved a piece of paper  in  the 
air.   "We  searched your apartment and found  telephone  company 
access codes that . . . "

"I want to call my lawyer," Miles interrupted calmly.  "Now,"  he 
commanded.

" . . . have been used to bypass  billing procedures."

"I  said I want to call my lawyer," Miles again said  emphatical-
     ly.

"I'll be out in an hour,"  he said aside to Stephanie and  kissed 
her  on the cheek. His arrogance was unnerving; this  wasn't  the 
same Miles that Scott had known in Amsterdam.  There, he was just 
another  misguided but well-intentioned techno-anarchist who  was 
more danger to himself than anyone else.  But now, as Tyrone read 
a  list of charges against him, mostly arcane FBI  domain  inter-
state offenses, Miles took on a new character.  A worldly  crimi-
nal  whom the FBI was arresting for potential  terrorist  activi-
ties.   

"And  those are for starters, Mister," Tyrone said after  reading 
off a list of penal violations by code number.  As if following a 
script, Tyrone added, "you have the right to remain silent . . ."  
He  wanted  to make sure that this was a clean arrest,  and  with 
this  many  witnesses, he was going to follow  procedure  to  the 
letter.  Mirandizing was one of the steps.   

Scott Mason's adrenaline flowed with intensity.  Did he ever have 
a story to tell now!  An absolute scoop.  He was present, coinci-
dentally, during the arrest of Miles Foster.

Front page.

"I want to call my lawyer," Miles repeated.  

"Make it quick," said Tyrone.  Miles rapidly dialed a number from 
memory.  

Miles  turned his back on Tyrone and the others and spoke  calmly 
into the phone. 

"It's me."  

Pause. 

"It's me.  I need assistance."  

Arrogance. Pause.  

"A laundry list of charges."  

Disinterest. Pause.  

"Had  to  happen, sooner or later, yeah,"   Miles  said  happily.  
Pause.

"I  gotta dinner party.  I don't want to miss it."  He smiled  at 
Stephanie and blew a kiss.  "Great.  Make it quick."  Miles  hung 
up.

Miles turned to Tyrone and held his wrists out together in  front 
of him.  "Let's go," Miles said still smiling cooly.

Tyrone  gently snapped the cuffs on Miles and ushered him  toward 
the door.

"Back in an hour or so," Miles defiantly said to Scott, Sonja and 
Stephanie over his shoulder as the front door closed behind Miles 
and his escorts. 

Scott watched in disbelief.  Miles, the Spook, ever so calm, cool 
and collected.  Not a fluster.  Not a blush.

Who  had  he called?  That was the question that  bothered  Scott 
throughout the rest of the evening.

     The White House, Washington, D.C.

The  President looked grim.  The normally affable Republican  had 
won  his second term by a landslide and had  maintained  unprece-
dented  popularity.  The Democrats had again been unable to  con-
jure  up  a  viable candidate after another  string  of  scandals 
rocked the primaries and the very foundation of the party  itself  
Their  entire platform focused on increasing the  Peace  Dividend 
beyond the aggressively reduced $180 Billion Defense budget.   It 
was not much  of an attack on a President whose popularity  never 
fell  below an astounding 65% approval, and the only ebb was  due 
to  a  minor White House incident involving a  junior  aide,  the 
junior aide's boyfriend and the Lincoln Bedroom.  

The  recession that was started by the Iraqi situation in  Kuwait 
during  the summer of 1990 was not as bad as it could have  been.  
The  world wide militaristic fever, proper Fed  Reserve  response 
and the Japanese all took credit for easing the  problem  through 
their specific efforts.  In fact, the recession was eased  due in 
part to all of their efforts as well the new Europe.  The  Presi-
dent  was rewarded, ultimately, with the credit for renewing  the 
economy almost glitch-free.

But the President was still grim.  America was again at war,  and 
only a handful of people in the upper echelons of the  Government 
even knew about it.  It would be in the paper in the morning.

                         Chapter 26

     Midnight, Tuesday, January 19
     Scarsdale, New York

Scott Mason awaited Kirk's midnight call.  

Now  that  they  had a deal, a win-win situation,  Kirk  and  his 
phriends  had become gung-ho.  Kirk agreed to help Scott  in  the 
dGraph  and Freedom situations if Scott would make sure that  his 
articles clearly spelled out the difference between the white-hat 
and black-hat hackers.

Journalistic responsibility demanded fair treatment of all  sides 
and  their  respective  opinions, and Scott  attempted  to  bring 
objectivity  to his analyses.  He did this well, quite well,  and 
still  was able to include his own views and biases, as  long  as 
they were properly qualified and disclaimed. 

Additionally, Kirk wanted assurances of total anonymity and  that 
Scott would not attempt to identify his location or name.   Scott 
also  had to agree to keep his Federal friends at a distance  and 
announce if they were privy to the conversations.

In  exchange  for fair portrayals in the press,  privacy  and  no 
government  intervention, Kirk promised Scott that the  resources 
of  Nemo would be focussed on finding defenses to the  virus  at-
tacks in dGraph and Freedom software.  If Kirk and Homosoto  were 
right,  millions  of computers would  experience  the  electronic 
equivalent of sudden cardiac arrest in less than two weeks.

The Times, Higgins and Doug agreed to the relationship but  added 
their own working caveats.  In order to treat Kirk as a protected 
source,  they  pretended he was a personal contact.   Instead  of 
reporter's  notes, Scott maintained an open file  which  recorded 
the  entirety  of their computer conversations.   There  were  no 
precedents for real-time electronic note taking, but Higgins felt 
confident that the records would protect the paper in any  event.  
Besides,  Supreme Court rulings now permit the recording of  con-
versations  by  hidden devices, as long as the person  taping  is 
actually present.  Again, Higgins felt he had solid position, but 
he  did ask Scott to ask Kirk's permission to save the  conversa-
tions on disk.  Kirk always agreed.

At midnight, Scott's computer beeped the anticipated beep.

WTFO

I heard a good one.

JOKE?

Yeah, do they work over computer?

TRY ME.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were in Europe and 
got  to meet the Pope.  Dopey really wanted to asked the  Pope  a 
few  questions. "Mr. Pope, Mr. Pope.  Do you have  pretty  nuns?"  
"Of course we do, Dopey."  "Mr. Pope, do you have fat ugly nuns?"  
"Why,  yes, Dopey, we do."  "And I bet, Mr. Pope, that  you  have 
some tall skinny nuns, too."  "Yes, Dopey we do."  "Mr. Pope?  Do 
you  have  nuns  in  Chicago?"  "Yes,  Dopey,  we  have  nuns  in 
Chicago?"   "And in San Francisco and New York?"   "Yes,  Dopey."  
"And  do  you have nuns in Africa and Australia and  in  France?"  
"Yes,  Dopey.  We have nuns everywhere."  Dopey took a second  to 
think and finally asked, "Mr. Pope?  Do you have nuns in  Antarc-
tica?"  "No, Dopey, I'm sorry, we don't have any nuns in  Antarc-
tica."  The other six dwarfs immediately broke out into a  laugh-
ing song: "Dopey fucked a penguin.  Dopey fucked a penguin."

HA HA HA HA HA!!!  LOVE IT.  REAL ICE BREAKER. HA HA.

Facetious?

NO, THAT'S GREAT.  IS YOUR RECORDER ON?

You bet.  No plagiarism.  What have you got?

MORE  THAN  I WISH I DID.  DGRAPH FIRST.  WE HAVE  IDENTIFIED  54 
SEPARATE  DGRAPH  VIRUSES. I HAVE A FILE FOR YOU.  IT  LISTS  THE 
VIRUS  BY DETONATION DATE AND TYPE, SYMPTOMS AND  THE  SIGNATURES 
NEEDED FOR REMOVAL.  ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO PRINT IT ALL?

Daily.   Our science section has been expanded to every day  from 
just Tuesday.  I have all the room I need.

YOU MIGHT MAKE ME RECONSIDER MY OPINION OF THE MEDIA.

Just the facts, ma'am.  Just the facts.

HA HA. WE'VE JUST TOUCHED THE SURFACE ON FREEDOM, BUT THE  WORD'S 
OUT.   FREEDOM  WILL BE AS GOOD AS DEAD IN DAYS.  THE  NUMBER  OF 
VIRUSES MUST NUMBER IN THE HUNDREDS. IT'S INCREDIBLE.  I'VE  SEEN 
A LOT OF VIRUSES, BUT NONE LIKE THIS.  IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THEY 
WERE  BUILT  ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE.  SOME ARE REAL  CLOSE  TO  EACH 
OTHER, EVEN DO THE SAME THINGS, BUT THEIR SIGNATURES ARE  DIFFER-
ENT  MAKING IT EXTRA HARD TO DETECT THEM.  EACH ONE WILL HAVE  TO 
BE DONE INDIVIDUALLY.

I suggest we start with the dGraph viruses.  You said 54, right?

SO FAR.

Send me the file and I still may have time to get it into  tomor-
row's paper.  They usually leave a little room.  

I'LL  SEND DGVIRUS.RPT.  IT'S IN ASCII FORMAT, EASY TO READ  INTO 
ANY FILE YOU'RE WORKING WITH.  

I think I can handle it.

     DGRAPH VIRUS LIST
     by Scott Mason

The  dGraph  Virus Crisis has set the computer  industry  into  a 
virtual  tailspin  with  far  reaching  effects  including  stock 
prices,  delayed purchasing, contract cancellation and a bevy  of 
reported lawsuits in the making.  

All  the same, the effects of the Crisis must be  mitigated,  and 
the  New York City Times will be providing daily  information  to 
assist our readers in fighting the viruses.  DGraph is now  known 
to  contain at least 54 different viruses, each designed to  exe-
cute different forms of damage to your computer.

According to computer security experts there are two ways to deal 
with the present virus crisis.  The best way to make sure that an 
active security system is in place in your computer.  Recommenda-
tions  vary,  but  it is generally agreed by  most  experts  that 
security, especially in the highly susceptible desktop and laptop 
personal computers, should be hardware based.  Security in  soft-
ware is viewed to be ineffective against well designed viruses or 
other offensive software mechanisms.

The  second  way to combat the effects of the dGraph  Virus,  but 
certainly not as effective, is to build a library of virus signa-
tures  and  search all of your computers for matches  that  would 
indicate  a viral infection.  This technique is minimally  effec-
tive  for many reasons:  Mutating viruses cause the signature  to 
change every time it infects another program, rendering the virus 
unidentifiable.  There is no way to be sure that all strains have 
been  identified.  Plus, there is no defense  against  subsequent 
viral  attacks, requiring defensive measures to  be  reinstituted 
every time.

Preliminary  predictions  by computer software experts  are  that 
between 1 and 5 million IBM compatible computers will be severely 
effected by the dGraph Viruses.  Computers tied to local area and 
wide area networks are likely to be hit hardest.  

Beginning  today, we will publish the known dGraph Virus  charac-
teristics daily to help disseminate the defensive information  as 
rapidly as possible.

Scott's  article  detailed  all 54 dGraph  Viruses.   Every  wire 
service  and news service in the country picked up the story  and 
reprinted  it  in their papers and magazines.  Within  24  hours, 
everyone who owned or used a computer had some weapons with which 
available  to him.  If they chose to believe in the danger.

     Wednesday, January 20
     The White House

"So what about this Mason character?"  Secretary of State Quinton 
Chambers  asked challengingly.  The President's inner circle  was 
again meeting to discuss the government's reaction to the impend-
ing chaos that Mr. Homosoto posthumously promised.  The  pre-dawn 
hours  were viewed as an ideal time to have upper level  meetings 
without the front door scrutiny of the press.

Phil  Musgrave  pulled  a folder from the stack in  his  lap  and 
opened it.  "Born 1953, he had an Archie Bunker for a father  but 
he  came out  a brain - IQ of 170.  Against Nam, who  wasn't;  he 
protested some, but not a leader.  No real trouble with the  law; 
couple  of demonstration arrests. City College, fared all  right, 
and  then set up his own company, worked in the defense  industry 
writing  manuals until he hit it big and sold out.  Divorced,  no 
kids.  Wife is kinda wacky.  The news business is new to him, but 
he's getting noticed fast."

"Is he a risk?"

"The  FBI hasn't completed their investigation," said Phil.   "If 
he is a risk, it's buried deep.  Surface wise, he's clean.   Only 
one problem."

"What's that?"

"He's an independent thinker."

"How's he done so far?"

"So far so good."

"So we let him continue?"

"Yesterday  he said he was willing to help, but I have  a  sneaky 
suspicion  he'll do better on his own without  our  interference.  
Besides, he prints every damn thing he does."

"What about their identity?"

"No  way.  He will maintain source protection, and I don't  think 
it matters right now.  Maybe later."

"What about the FBI friend?"

"The FBI is aware of it, and views it favorably.  Duncan's  rela-
tionship has been exclusively personal until recently.  It  seems 
to serve both sides well."

"So you're saying he's working for us and not knowing it?"

"He  probably  knows it, and probably, like most  of  the  media, 
doesn't care.  His job is to report the news.  It just so happens 
that we read the same newspapers.  Let's leave him alone."

The  President  held up his hand to signal an end to  the  debate 
between State policy and the White House Chief of Staff.  "Unless 
anyone can give me a good goddammed reason to fix something  that 
seems  to be working," he said, "let Mason do his job and let  us 
do  ours."   He  looked around the Oval Office  for  comments  or 
dissent.  It was a minor point and nobody thought it  significant 
enough to pursue.  Yet.  "Next?"  The President commanded.

Refills  of coffee were distributed and the pile of Danishes  was 
shrinking as the men casually dined during their 6:00 A.M.  meet-
     ing.

"OSO Industries appears, by all first impressions, to have  noth-
ing to do with the threats."  Henry Kennedy was expected to  know 
more than anyone else at this point.  "Investigations are contin-
uing, but we have no reason to suspect a smoking gun."

"One man did all of this?"  asked the President skeptically.

"We  have no doubt that he accomplished at least the  dGraph  vi-
ruses  with accomplices and a great deal of money."   Henry  knew 
his  material.  With the combined help of the NSA, CIA,  FBI  and 
international  contacts, the National Security Advisor was  privy 
to an incredible range of information.  He was never told direct-
ly that U.S. agents regularly penetrated target computers as part 
of  any investigation, or that they listened in on computers  and 
communications to gather information. But Henry Kennedy preferred 
it  this  way;  not to officially know where  he  got  his  data.  
Professional deniability.

"We  also  have every reason to believe that  he  used  technical 
talent  outside of OSO," Kennedy continued.  "Perhaps as many  as 
thirty or forty people involved."

The inner circle whistled.  "Thirty or forty?  That's a conspira-
cy," commented Quinton.

"I  agree  with Quinton. What I think we need to do  here,"  said 
Phil  Musgrave to the others in the room and the  President,  "is 
expand our previous definition of terrorism.  Doesn't a threat to 
international  stability  and  the economic well  being  of  this 
country constitute terrorism?"  He gazed into each of the listen-
er's  eyes then said, "In my mind it clearly does."  He  referred 
to  the  work at the Department of State which, since  the  Iraqi 
War,  had clearly expanded the operational definition of  terror-
ism. 

"There's more," Henry said soberly.  "Four months ago the FBI was 
inundated with reports of blackmail.  None materialized but still 
take  up  a  great deal of manpower  and  resources.   Classified 
defense  technology is used to shut down the Stock  Exchange  and 
other major businesses. Two months ago an Irani foreign  national 
was killed in New York.  He was driving a vehicle which contained 
sophisticated computer monitoring equipment."

"Has anything developed on that front?" the President asked.   "I 
remember reading about that.  It was a tragedy."

"It was," agreed Phil Musgrave.

"We had the FBI, the CI division take apart what was left of  the 
van  and we began a cross trace,"  Henry pulled out  yet  another 
file from his stack.  "It seems that during a two month period in 
1988, a disproportionate number of identical Ford Econoline  vans 
were  paid for in cash.  As far as the dealer is  concerned,  the 
customer disappeared.  Unless they're using stolen plates,  they-
're part of the DMV system.  The New York van was registered to a 
non-existent address.  Roadblocked."

"And  don't  forget the First State incident, INTERNET,  the  FAA  
radar  systems,"   Quinton Chambers said to  the  President.   He 
listed  a long series of computer malfunctions over the prior  60 
days.  "It appears at this point that we have been experiencing a 
prelude,  the  foreplay  if you will, of  something  worse.   The 
Homosoto  letter  makes him as good a candidate as  anyone  right 
now."

Even  Andrew  Coletree felt in concert with the  others  on  this 
point.  "If what has happened to computers, the traffic  systems, 
airplanes, to the IRS, the Stock Exchange, Fed Ex, and God  knows 
what  else is all from one man, Homosoto, then yes, it's a  army, 
an attack."

"What  if  we declare war?" Secretary of State  Quinton  Chambers 
said, fully expecting immediate agreement with his idea.

"On who? The Computers?" jibed Defense Secretary Coletree.   "The 
damned  Computer Liberation Organization will be the next  endan-
gered minority." 

"Declaring  war  is a joke, excuse me Mr. President,"  said  Phil 
Musgrave.   "It's  a joke and the American people won't  buy  it.  
They're getting hit where it hurts them the most.  In their pock-
ets.  We have major business shut downs, and they want an answer.  
A fix, not a bunch of hype.  We've had the war on crime, the  war 
on  drugs,  the war on poverty and they've  all  been  disasters.  
Things  are worse now than before.  They've had it with  bullshit 
and they're scared right now."

The  President  bowed and rotated his head to work  out  a  kink.  
"The position of think," Musgrave would say.  Then the refreshing 
snap in the President's neck would bring a smile of relief to the 
corners of Chief Executive's mouth.  

"What  if  we did it and meant it?" asked the  President  with  a 
devilish grin.  No one responded.  "What if we declared war, with 
the approval of Congress, and actually did something about it."

"A unique concept," quipped Musgrave.  "Government  accomplishing 
something."   Penetrating glares from Coletree and  Kennedy  only 
furthered the President's amusement.  He enjoyed the banter.

"No, let me run this by you, and see what you think," the  Presi-
dent  thought out loud.  "We are facing a crisis of epic  propor-
tions,  we  all agree on that.  Potential  economic  chaos.   Why 
don't  we deal with it that way.  Why don't we really go out  and 
fix  it?"   Still no reactions.  "What is wrong  with  you  guys?  
Don't you get it?  Mediocrity is pass.  It can't be sold to  the 
this  country again. For the first time in almost two  centuries, 
the American people may have to defend themselves, in their homes 
and  businesses on their home land.  If that's the case,  then  I 
think that leadership should come from the White House."

The  President rose and leaned on the back of his  chair.   There 
was quiet muttering among his top aides.  "Aren't you  stretching 
the  point a little, sir?" asked the Chambers, the silver  haired 
statesman.  "After all, it was just one man . . ."

"That's  the  point!" shouted the President.  "That's  the  whole 
damned point."  He strode around to the old white fireplace  with 
a  photo of George Washington above it.  If permitted, this  spot 
would be labeled 'Photo Opportunity' by the White House tours.

"Look  what  one man can do.  I never claimed  to  know  anything 
about computers, but what if this was a warning?"

"Don't get maudlin on us . . ."

"I  am  not getting anything except angry,"  the  President  said 
raising his voice.  "I remember what they said about Bush.   They 
said if he was Moses, he would have brought down the ten  sugges-
tions.  That will not happen to me."

The inner circle stole questioning glances from each other.  

"This country has not had a common cause since Kennedy pointed us 
at the moon.  We had the chance in the '70's to build a  national 
energy policy, and we screwed it up royally when oil prices  were 
stable.   So  what do we do?"  His rhetorical question  was  best 
left  unanswered.   "We  now import more than  50%  of  our  oil.  
That's  so stupid . . .don't let me get started."  There  was  an 
obvious sigh of relief from Chambers and Musgrave and the others.  
When  the President got like this, real pissed off, he  needed  a 
sounding  board, and it was generally one or more of them.   Such 
was the price of admission to the inner circle.

The  President  abruptly shifted his manner  from  the  political 
altruist still inside him to the management realist that had made 
him a popular leader.  He spoke with determination.

"Gentlemen,  exactly what is the current policy and  game  plan?"  
The  President's gaze was not returned.  "Henry?  Andrew?"   Mus-
grave  and  Chambers and Secretary of the Treasury  Martin  Royce 
wished they could disappear into the wallpaper.  They had seen it 
before, and they were seeing it again.  Senior aides eaten  alive 
by the President.

"Henry?   What's  the procedure?"  The President's  voice  showed 
increasing irritation.

"Sir, CERT, the Computer Emergency Response Team was activated  a 
few  months  ago  to investigate  Network  Penetrations,"   Henry 
Kennedy  said.  "ECCO, another computer team is working with  the 
FBI on related events.  Until yesterday we didn't even know  what 
we were up against, and we still barely understand it."

"That  doesn't change the question, Henry.  What are the  channel 
contingencies?   Do I have to spell it out?"  The President  mel-
lowed  some.  "I was hoping to spare myself the embarrassment  of 
bringing  attention to the fact that the President of the  United 
States is unaware of the protocol for going to war with a comput-
er."  The lilt in his voice cut the edge in the room,  momentari-
ly.  "Now that that is out in the open, please enlighten us all."   
The jaws were preparing to close tightly.

Henry  Kennedy  glanced  nervously over at  Andrew  Coletree  who 
replied  by  rubbing the back of his neck.   "Sir,"  Henry  said, 
"basically there is no defined, coordinated, that is  established 
procedures  for something like this."  The President's neck  red-
dened around the collar as Henry stuttered.  "If you will  permit 
me to explain . . ."

The President was furious.  In over thirty years of  professional 
politics, not even his closest aides had ever seen him so totally 
out of character.  The placid Texan confidence he normally  exud-
ed,  part  well designed media image, part real,  was  completely 
shattered.  

"Are  you  telling me that we spent almost $4  trillion  dollars, 
four goddamn trillion dollars on defense, and we're not  prepared 
to  defend our computers?  You don't have a game plan?  What  the 
hell  have we been doing for the last 12 years?"   The  President 
bellowed  as loudly as anyone could remember. No one in the  room 
answered.  The President glared right through each of his  senior 
aides. 

"Damage Assessment Potential?"  The President said abruptly as he 
forced a fork full of scrambled eggs into his mouth.

"The  Federal  Reserve and most banking transactions  come  to  a 
virtual standstill.  Airlines grounded save for emergency  opera-
tions.    Telephone  communications  running at 30%  or  less  of 
capacity.   No  Federal payments for weeks.  Do you  want  me  to 
continue?"

"No, I get the picture."

The  President  wished to God he wouldn't be  remembered  as  the 
President who allowed the United States of America to slip  back-
ward 50 years.  He waited for the steam in his collar to  subside 
before saying anything he might regret.

"Marv?"   For  the  first time  the  President  acknowledged  the 
presence  of  Marvin Jacobs, Director of  the  National  Security 
Agency.  Jacobs had thus far been a silent observer.  He respond-
ed to the President.

"Yessir?"

"I will be signing a National Security Decision Directorate and a 
Presidential Order later today, authorizing the National Security 
Agency to lead the investigation of computer crimes, and  related 
events  that may have an effect on the national  security."   The 
President's  words  stunned Jacobs and Coletree  and  the  others 
except for Musgrave.

"Sir?"

"Do  you or do you not have the largest computers in the  world?"  
Jacobs nodded in agreement.  "And do you not listen in to  every-
thing going on in the world in the name of National Security?"  

Jacobs winced and noticed that besides the President, others were 
interested in his answer.  He meekly acknowledged the  assumption 
by a slight tilt of his head. 

"I recall, Marv," the President said, "that in 1990 you  yourself 
asked  for the National Computer Security Center to be  disbanded 
and  be  folded  into the main operations of  the  Agency.   Bush 
issued a Presidential Order rescinding Reagan's NSDD-145.  Do you 
recall?"

"Yes,  of course I do," said Marvin defensively.  "It made  sense 
then, and given it's charter, it still makes sense.  But you must 
understand  that  the  Agency is only  responsible  for  military 
security.  NIST handles civilian."

"Do  you  think  that the civilian agencies  and  the  commercial 
computers face any less danger than the military computers?"  The 
President  quickly qualified his statement.  "Based upon what  we 
know now?"

"No, not at all." Jacobs felt himself being boxed into a  corner. 
"But we're not tooled up for  . . ."  

"You will receive all the help you need," the President said with 
assurance.   "I guarantee it."   His words dared anyone  to  defy 
his command.

"Yessir,"  Jacobs said humbly.  "What about NIST?"

"Do you need them?"

"No question."

"Consider it done.  I expect you all here at the same time tomor-
row  with preliminary game plans."  He knew that would get  their 
attention.  Heads snapped up in disbelief.  

"One  day?" complained Andrew Coletree.  "There's no way that  we 
can begin to mobilize and organize the research . . ."

"That's  the kind of talk I do not want to hear, gentlemen,"  the 
President said.  Coletree turned red.  

"Mr. President," said Chambers.  "If we were going to war . . ."

"Sir," the President said standing straight,  "we are already  at 
war.   You're  just not acting like it.  According  to  you,  the 
vital  interests of this country have been attacked.  It  is  our 
job to defend the country.  I call that war.   If we are going to 
sell  a Computer War to America, we better start acting  like  we 
take it seriously.  Tomorrow, gentlemen.  Pull out the stops."

     1:15 P.M., New York City

Upon returning from lunch, Scott checked his E-Mail at the Times.  
Most  of  the messages he received were from co-workers  or  news 
associates  in  other  cities.  He also heard from  Kirk  on  the 
paper's supposedly secure network.  Neither he nor the  technical 
network gurus ever figured out how he got in the system.

The network administrators installed extra safeguards after Scott 
tipped them that he had been receiving messages from outside  the 
paper.  They added what they called 'audit trails'.  Audit trails 
are  supposed to record and remember every activity on  the  net-
work.  The hope was that they could observe Kirk remotely  enter-
ing the computer and then identify the security breach.   Despite 
their  attempts, Kirk continued to enter the Times' computers  at 
will, but without any apparent disruption of the system.

It  took  Scott some time to convince the network  managers  that 
Kirk  posed no threat, but they felt that any breach  was  poten-
tially a serious threat to journalistic privilege.

Reporters  kept their notes on the computer. Sources,  addresses, 
phone numbers, high level anonymous contacts and identities,  all 
stored within a computer that is presumably protected and secure.  
In  reality, the New York City Times computer, like most  comput-
ers. is as open as a sieve.

Scott could live with it.  He merely didn't keep any notes on the 
computer.   He stuck with the old tried and true method  of  hand 
written notes.

His E-Mail this time contained a surprise.

     IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT HOW I DID IT, CALL ME TONIGHT.  9PM.  
     416-555-3165.  THE SPOOK.

A  pit suddenly developed in Scott's stomach.  The last  time  he 
remembered  having that feeling was when he watched Bernard  Shaw 
broadcast the bombing of Baghdad.  The sense of sudden  helpless-
ness,  the  foreboding of the unknown.  Or perhaps the  shock  of 
metamorphosis when one's thoughts enter the realm of the unreal.  

Then came the doubt.  

"Ty,"  Scott asked after calling him at his office.   "What  hap-
pened to Foster?"  He spoke seriously.

"True to his word," Tyrone laughed with frustration, "he was  out 
in an hour.  He said he was coming back to your party . . ."

"Never  showed up."  Scott paused to think.  "How did he get  out 
so fast?"

"He called the right guy.  Charges have been reduced to a  couple 
of misdemeanors; local stuff."

"So, isn't he your guy?"

"We're off, right?"  Tyrone though to double check.

"Completely.  I just need to know for myself."

"Bullshit," Tyrone retorted. "But for argument's sake, I know  he 
had something to do with it, and so do a lot of other people."

"So what's the problem?"

"A technicality called proof," sighed Tyrone.  "We have enough on 
him  for a circumstantial case.  We know his every move since  he 
left  the  NSA.  How much he spent and on whom.  We know  he  was 
with Homosoto, but that's all we know.  And yes,  he is a comput-
er genius."

"And he goes free?"

"For now.  We'll get him."

"Who pulled the strings?"

"The Prosecutor's office put up a brick wall.  Told us we had  to 
get  better  evidence.  I though we were all on the  same  side."  
Tyrone's discouragement was evident, even across the phone wires.

"Still planning on making a move?"

"I'll  talk to you later."  The phone went dead on Scott's  ears.  
He had clearly said a no-no on the phone.

     Cambridge, Massachusetts

Lotus Development Corporation headquarters has been the stage for 
demonstrations  by  free-software  advocates.   Lotus'   lawsuits 
against Mosaic Software, Paperback Software and Borland created a 
sub-culture  backlash against the giant software company.   Lotus 
sued its competitors on the basis of a look-and-feel copyright of 
the  hit  program  1-2-3.  That is, Lotus sued  to  keep  similar 
products from emulating their screens and key sequences.

Like  Hewlett Packard, Apple and Microsoft who were also  in  the 
midst  of  legal battles  regarding  intellectual-property  copy-
rights,  Lotus received a great deal of media attention.  By  and 
large their position was highly unpopular, and the dense  univer-
sity  culture  which represented free exchange  of  programs  and 
information provided ample opportunity to demonstrate against the 
policies of Lotus.

Eileen Isselbacher had worked at Lotus as a Spreadsheet  Customer 
Service Manager for almost two years.  She was well respected and 
ran  a  tight ship.  Her first concern, one that  her  management 
didn't necessarily always share, was to the customer.  If someone 
shelled out $500 for a program, they were entitled to  impeccable 
service and assistance.  Despite her best efforts, though,  Lotus 
had  come to earn a reputation of arrogance and  indifference  to 
customer complaints.  It was a constant public relations  battle; 
for the salespeople, for customer service, and for the  financial 
people who attempted to insure a good Wall Street image.

The  service  lines are shut down at 6 P.M. EST and  then  Eileen 
enters the Service Data Base.  The SDB is a record of all service 
calls.  The service reps logged the call, the serial #, the  type 
of problem and the resolution.  Eileen's last task of the day was 
to compile the data accumulated during the day and issue a  daily 
summation report.

She commanded the data base to "Merge All Records".  Her computer 
terminal, on the Service Department's Novell Pentium-server  net-
work began crunching.

     12,346 Calls between 7:31 AM and 5:26 PM.  

That was a normal number of calls. 

     Serial Numbers Verified.
     The Data Base had to double check that the serial number was 
     a real one, issued to a legitimate owner.

     712 Bad Disks

Her department sent out replacement disks to verified owners  who 
had a damaged disk.  A little higher than the average of 509, but 
not significant enough unless the trend continues.  

     FLAG!!
     4,576 Computational Errors

Eileen's attention immediately focussed in on the FLAG!! message.  
The Computational Error figures were normally '0' or '1' a  week.  
Now, 5,000 in one day?

She  had the computer sort the 4,576 CE's into the serial  number 
distribution.  The Service Department was able to act as a quali-
ty control monitor for engineering and production.  If  something 
was  wrong - once a few hundred thousand copies hit the  field  - 
the  error would show up by the number of calls.  But  CE's  were 
normally operator error.  Not the computer's.

There  was no correlation to serial numbers.  Old  Version  1.0's 
through  Version  3.0 and 3.1 were affected as were  the  current 
versions.   By  all  reports, Lotus 1-2-3 could  no  longer  add, 
subtract, divide, multiply or compute accurately.  Mass  computa-
tional  errors.   The bell curve across serial numbers  was  flat 
enough to obviate the need for a statistical analysis.  This  was 
clearly not an engineering design error.  Nor was it a production 
error, or a run of bad disks.  Something had changed.

     Scarsdale, New York

On  the  6:12 to Scarsdale, Tyrone and Scott joined for  a  beer.  
The conversation was not to be repeated.

"ECCO,  CERT,  the whole shooting match," Tyrone  whispered  loud 
enough  to be heard over the rumble of the train, "are moving  to 
NSA  control.   NIST  is out.  They all work for  the  Fort  now. 
Department of Defense."

"Are you shitting me?"  Scott tried to maintain control.

"It'll  be  official tomorrow," Tyrone said.  "Write  your  story 
tonight. The NSA has won again."

"What do you mean, again?"

"Ah,"  Tyrone said trying to dismiss his frustrated insight  into 
agency  rivalry.   "It seems that whatever they want,  they  get.  
Their  budget  is secret, their purpose is secret, and  now  they 
have  every  computer security concern at their  beck  and  call.  
Orders of the President."

"Aren't they the best suited for the job, though . . ."

"Technically, maybe.  Politically, no way!"  Tyrone said adamant-
ly.   "I think the Bureau could match their power, but they  have 
another unfair advantage."

Scott looked curiously at Tyrone.

"They wrote the rules."

* * * * * 

     Scarsdale, New York

Speedo's Pizza was late, so Scott got the two $9 medium pepperoni 
pizzas for free, tipping the embarrassed delivery boy $10 for his 
efforts.   Not his fault that his company makes  absurd  promises 
and contributes to the accident rate.

As  9:00 P.M. approached, Scott's stomach knotted up.  He  wasn't 
quite sure what he would find when he dialed the Canadian number.  
It was a cellular phone exchange meaning that while he dialed the 
Toronto  416  area code, the call was probably rerouted  by  call 
forwarding to another location, also connected by cellular phone.  
Untraceable.   Damn sneaky.  And legal.  Technology For The  Peo-
ple.

     <<<<<<DIALING  4165553165 . . . . . .>>>>>>

Scott listened to the small speaker on his internal modem card as 
it dialed the tones in rapid sequence.  A click, a buzz and  then 
in  the background, Scott heard the faintest of tones.  Was  that 
crosstalk  from another line or was another secret  number  being 
dialed?  

     <<<<<< CONNECTION 4800 BAUD>>>>>>

The screen hesitated for few seconds then prompted . . .

IDENTIFY YOURSELF:

Scott  wondered  what to enter.  His real name?   Or  the  handle 
Kirk's hackers gave him.

Scott Mason aka Repo Man

Again  the computer display paused, seemingly  pondering  Scott's 
response.  

I SUPPOSE ASKING FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION WOULD OFFEND YOU.

I'm  getting used to it.  Paranoia runs rampant in your  line  of 
work.

LET'S  SAVE  THE EDITORIALIZING FOR NOW.  GIVE ME  THE  WARM  AND 
FUZZIES.  PROVE YOU'RE SCOTT MASON.  

You can't keep your eyes off of Sonja's chest as I recall.

GOOD START.  NICE TITS.

So you're Miles Foster.

THERE ARE GROUNDRULES.  FIRST.  MY NAME IS THE SPOOK.  MR. SPOOK. 
DR. SPOOK.  PROFESSOR SPOOK. KING SPOOK.  I DON'T CARE WHAT,  BUT 
I  AM THE SPOOK AND ONLY THE SPOOK.  MY IDENTITY, IF I HAVE  ONE, 
IS  TO REMAIN MY LITTLE SECRET.  UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THAT, WE  WILL 
GET NOWHERE FAST.  

Like I said, you're Miles Foster.

NO. AND IF I WAS, IT WOULDN'T MATTER.  I AM THE SPOOK.  I AM YOUR 
PERSONAL DEEP THROAT.  YOUR BEST FRIEND.  

Let  me see if I understand this right.  You will tell  all,  the 
whole  story on the record, as long as you stay the  Spook?   Use 
your name, Spook, in everything?

THAT'S IT. 

The paper has given me procedures.  I have to record  everything. 
Save it to disk, and give a copy to the lawyers.

ARE YOU SAVING THIS YET?

No.  Not until we agree.  Then we outline the terms and go.

I'M  IMPRESSED.  YOU ARE THE FIRST REPORTER I'VE HEARD OF TO  USE 
COMPUTERS AS A SOURCE.  WHO DEVELOPED THE RULES?

The lawyers, who else?

FIGURES.  

So. Do we have a deal?

LET ME SEE THE CONTRACT.

Scott and the Spook exchanged notes over their modems and comput-
ers until they arrived at terms they both could live with.  After 
Kirk,  the  rules  Higgins had established were  clear,  easy  to 
follow  and fair.  Scott set his computer to Save  the  conversa-
tion.

This is Scott Mason, speaking to a person who identifies  himself 
only as the Spook.  I do not know the sex of this person, nor his 
appearance as all conversations are occurring over computer modem 
and  telephone lines.  The Spook contacted me today,  through  my 
office computer.  This is his amazing story.

Spook.  Why did you call me?

I  DESIGNED THE COMPUTER INVASION OF THE UNITED STATES  FOR  TAKI 
HOMOSOTO.  WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW I DID IT?

     Wednesday, January 20
     National Security Agency

Marvin  Jacobs had a busy day and evening. And  night,  preparing 
for  his  meeting with the President. He would have a  chance  to 
make his point, and win it, with an audience in attendance.   The 
high level bureaucrat craved to aspire within the echelons of the 
government  hierarchy,  but his inate  competence  prevented  his 
goals from being realized.

During  Korea  Lt.  Marvin Jacobs served his country  as  90  day 
wonder  straight out of ROTC.  A business major with a  minor  in 
civic  administration did not prepare him for the tasks the  Army 
had in store for him.  Army Intelligence was in desperate need of 
quality  analysts, people with minds more than  marshmallows  for 
brain.  The Army Intelligence Division G-2 personnel staff poured 
through  new recruit files in hopes of recruiting them  into  the 
voluntary   program.    But   the   catch   phrase,    'Military-
Intelligence,'  a contradiction in terms' made their  job  doubly 
difficult.   So they resorted to other tactics to recruit  quali-
fied  people  for an unpopular and often despised branch  of  the 
military:   they  made deals, and they made Lt. Marvin  Jacobs  a 
deal he couldn't refuse.

Young Captain Jacobs returned to the United States at the end  of 
the  conflict as a highly skilled and experienced  communications 
manager for the evolving communications technology; as antiquated 
as it appears today.  His abilities were widely needed by  emerg-
ing factions of the government as McCarthyism and the fear of the 
Red Menace were substituted for Hot War.  

The  super  secret  NSA, whose existence was unknown  to  a  vast 
majority  of Congress at that time, made him the best offer  from 
all  the Federal Agencies.  The payscales were the same, but  the 
working  conditions  promised were far superior  at  the  Agency.   
Marvin  Jacobs  had studied to serve as a civil servant,  but  he 
imagined himself in Tecumseh, Michigan politics, not  confronting 
the Communist Threat.

He  was  rewarded  for his efforts, handsomely.   In  the  sports 
world,  they call it a signing bonus.  In the deep dark  untrace-
able world of the National Security Agency they call it All  Paid 
Reconnaissance.  APR, for short.  Travel when and where you like, 
ostensibly  on  behalf  of your government.  If  worse  comes  to 
worst, attend a half day seminar and make yourself seen.

By  the  time he was thirty-five, Marvin Jacobs, now a  well  re-
spected  management fixture at the NSA, had seen the world  twice 
over.   Occasionally he traveled on business.  For the first  ten 
years  with the Agency he traveled with his wife, college  sweet-
heart  Sarah Bell, and then less so as their three  children  ma-
tured.  Still, although he now travels alone more often than not, 
he was on a plane going somewhere at least twice a month, if only 
for a weekend.

The  Directorship  of the NSA landed in his lap  unexpectedly  in 
1985, when the schism between the Pentagon and the Fort became an 
unsurvivable  political  nightmare for his  predecessor.   Marvin 
Jacobs, on the other hand, found the job the deserved cherry on a 
career dedicated to his country.  It was largely a political job, 
and  managing  the competing factions of his huge  secret  empire 
occupied most of his time.  

The prestige, the power, the control and the responsibility alone 
wasn't  enough for Marvin Jacobs.  He wanted more.  He wanted  to 
make a difference.  A very dangerous combination.

"It  is  so good to hear your voice, Ahmed Shah,"   Beni  Rafjani 
said in Farsi over an open clear overseas line.  

"And  you. I am but Allah's servant," replied Ahmed,  bowing  his 
head slightly as he spoke.

"As we all are.  But today I call to say you can come home."

"Home?   Iran?"  The excitement in Ahmed's voice was more due  to 
the call than the news.  "Why?"

"I  thought you would be pleased, now that the Red Sun has  set."  
The  cryptic  reference to the death of  Homosoto  wouldn't  fool 
anybody listening, but inuendo was non-admissible.

"Yes,  my  work is going well, and I have learned much,  as  have 
hundreds  of students that attend my classes.  However, with  all 
due  respect,  I think we may accomplish more by  continuing  the 
work that our esteemed leader began.  Why should we stop now?  It 
goes very well - in our favor."

"I understand," Rafjani said with respect.  "You are honored  for 
your sacrifice, living among the infidels."

"It must be done.  I mean no disrespect."

"You  do  not  speak disrepectfully, Ahmed Shah.   Your  work  is 
important  to your people.  If that is your wish,  continue,  for 
you do it well."

"Thank  you, thank you.  Even though one grain of sand has  blown 
away, the rest of the desert retains great power." 

"Ahmed Shah, may Allah be with you."

                         Chapter 27

     Thursday, January 21
     The White House, Washington, D.C.

He wanted to make them wait.  

The  President decided to walk into the breakfast room for  their 
early  morning meeting a few minutes late.  Even with  intimates, 
the awe of the Presidency was still intact.  His tardiness  added 
to  the  tension  that they all felt as a result  of  the  recent 
revelations.  Perhaps the tension would further hone their atten-
tion and dialogue. 

He  had  not  slept well the night before; he  was  prepared  for 
anything  he understood, but computers were not on his roster  of 
acquired  fluencies.   A President has to make  decisions,  tough 
decisions,  life and death decisions, but decisions of  the  type 
that  have  a history to study and a lesson to learn.   And  like 
most  of  those before him, he was well equipped  to  make  tough 
decisions,  right  or wrong.  Presidents have to  have  the  self 
confidence  and internal resolve to commit themselves, and  their 
nation,  to a course of action.  This President's political  life 
trained him well; lawyer, local politics, state politics and then 
Washington.

But  not  computers.  He was not trained in  computers.   He  had 
learned to type, a little, and found that sending E-Mail messages 
was great fun.  To him it was a game.  Since the first days  when 
microcomputers  had invaded the offices of governmental  Washing-
ton,  he had been able to insulate himself from their day to  day 
use.  All the same, every desk he had occupied was adjoined by  a 
powerful microcomputer fitted with the finest graphics, the  best 
printer and an elite assortment of software.  He used the  memory 
resident calculator and sent and received electronic mail.   That 
was it.

The  President, as most men of his generation, accepted the  fact 
that  computers  now  ran the show.  The  whole  shooting  match.  
Especially the military.  The communications and computer sophis-
tication used by the Allies enthralled the world during the Iraqi 
War:  bombs  smart enough to pick which window they  would  enter 
before  detonating, missiles smart enough to fly at 2000 mph  and 
destroy  an incoming missile moving at 3000 mph.  It  turned  out 
that  hitting  a  bullet with a bullet was  possible  after  all.  
Intuitively, the President knew that the crisis developing before 
his  eyes  meant massive computer damage, and  the  repercussions 
would be felt through the economy and the country.  

However,  the  President did not have enough computer  basics  to 
begin to understand the problem, much less the answers.  This was 
the first time during his administration that major tactical  and 
policy  decisions would be made primarily by others.  His  was  a 
duty  of rubber stamping.  That worry frustrated his attempts  at 
sleeping  and  nagged at him before the meeting.   And  then,  of 
course, there was the press.  

"Gentlemen,"  the President said sauntering towards his chair  at 
the head of the large formal breakfast table.  He opened the door 
with enough vigor to startle his guests.  He maintained his usual 
heads-up  smile and spry gait as he noticed that there  were  new 
faces present.

In addition to the inner circle, Marvin Jacobs asked two key  NSA 
security  analysts to be observers at the meeting.  Only if   the 
President  asked  a  question was it then  all  right  to  speak.  
Accompanying  Phil  Musgrave, under admitted duress  to  repay  a 
previous  favor,  was Paul Trump, Director of NIST,  the  eternal 
rival  of  the NSA in matters of computers.   The  President  was 
introduced  to the guests and smiled to himself.   He  recognized 
that the political maneuvering was beginning already.  Maybe  the 
competition would help, he thought.

"Marv,"  the President said leaning away from the waiter  pouring 
his coffee.  This was the same waiter who had spilled near  boil-
ing  liquid in his lap last month.  "I guess it's your  show,  so 
I'll  just  sit  back and keep my mouth shut."   He  leaned  even 
further  away as the waiter's clumsiness did not  inspire  confi-
dence.

Group chuckle notwithstanding, everyone in the inner circle  knew 
what  the President really meant.  The President was  hungry  and 
Marv Jacobs would not be eating breakfast.  He would be answering 
questions.

"Thank  you, sir," Marv said as he courteously  acknowledged  the 
presence of the others.  He handed out a file folder to  everyone 
in the room.  Each was held together with a red strap labeled TOP 
SECRET that sealed the package.  Not until the President began to 
open his package did the others follow suit.

"We've only had a day to prepare . . ." Marvin Jacobs began.

"I know," the President said wiping the corner of his mouth  with 
a  white linen napkin.  "That should have been plenty  of  time."  
Marvin,  wisely avoided responding to the President's  barb.   He 
took  the  caustic  hit as the other  breakfast  guests   quietly 
thanked  the powers on high that it was someone elses turn to  be 
in  the hot seat.  All in all, though, the President was  a  much 
calmer person this morning than during his verbal tirade the  day 
before.  But, if needed, the acerbity of his biting  words  would 
silence  the boldest of his advisors or enemies.   The  President 
was still royally pissed off.

"We  have  developed a number of scenarios that will  be  refined 
over  the  next weeks as we learn more about the  nature  of  the 
assault  by Homosoto."  He turned into his report  and  indicated 
that everyone should turn to page 4.  "This is sketchy, but based 
upon  what  we have seen already, we can estimate the  nature  of 
what we're up against."

Page 4 contained three Phrases.

     1. Malevolent Self Propagating Software Programs (Viruses)
     2. Unauthorized Electromagnetic Pulses and Explosions
     3. Anti-TEMPEST Coherent Monitor and Pixel Radiation.

Marvin  Jacobs described the observed behavior of each  category, 
but  nonetheless  the President was unhappy.  A rehash  from  the 
newspapers.

"That's  it?"  the President asked in disbelief.  "You call  that 
an estimate?  I can find out more than that from CNN."

"At this point, that's about it."

"I  still  can't believe this," the President said,  shaking  his 
head.   "What the hell am I going to say when I have to face  the 
press?   'Sorry  folks, our computers and the country  are  going 
down  the toilet, and we really don't know what to do  about  it.  
Seems  as if no one took the problem seriously'"   The  President 
gazed  at Marvin and Henry Kennedy, half expecting them to  break 
into tears.  "Bullshit!"

"Sir, may I be blunt?"  Marvin asked.

"Of  course, please.  That's what we're here for," the  President 
said, wondering how blunt was blunt. 

"Sir,  this is certainly no time to place blame on anyone, but  I 
do think that at a minimum some understanding is in order."   All 
eyes turned to Jacobs as he spoke.  "Sir, the NSA has been in the 
business of safeguarding military computer systems for years."

"That's arguable," said the President critically.

Marvin  continued  unaffected.  "Cryptography and  listening  and 
deciphering  are our obvious strong points.  But neither  Defense 
nor Treasury," he said alluding to each representative from their 
respective agencies, "can spend money without Congress's  approv-
al.   Frankly sir, that is one of the major stumbling  blocks  we 
have encountered in establishing a coherent security policy."

"That's  a  pile of bull, Marv," said NIST's feisty  Paul  Trump.  
Paul and Marv had known each other for years, became friends  and 
then as the NIST-NSA rift escalated in '89 and '90, they saw less 
of each other on a social basis.  "Sir," Paul spoke to the Presi-
dent, "I'm sorry for interrupting . . ."

"Say what you have to say."

"Yessir."   Trump  had no trouble being direct  either.   Nearing 
mandatory retirement age had made Trump more daring.  Willing  to 
take  more risks in the best interest of NIST and  therefore  the 
nation.   Spry and agile, Paul Trump looked twenty years  younger 
with no signs of slowing down.

"Sir,  the reason that we don't have any security in the  govern-
ment  is  due  to Congress.  We, Marv and I, agree  on  that  one 
point.  Martin, do you concur?"

Treasury  Secretary Martin Royce vigorously nodded in  agreement.  
"We've been mandated to have security for years, but no one  says 
where the money's coming from.  The hill made the laws but didn't 
finish the job."

The  President  enjoyed the banter among his  elite  troops.   He 
thrived  on open dissent and debate, making it easier for him  to 
weigh information and opinions.  That freedom reminded him of how 
difficult  it must have been for the Soviets to  openly  disagree 
and consider unpopular positions. 

It seems that after Khrushchev took over,  in one Politburo meet-
ing,  he  received a handwritten note which said: 'If  you're  so 
liberal,  how  come you never stood up  to  Stalin.'   Khrushchev 
scoured the room for a clue as to who made the insulting comment. 
After  a tense few seconds he said, 'would the comrade who  wrote 
this  stand up so I may answer him face to face?'  No one  stood.  
'Now, you know the answer.'

The President's point was, around here anything goes, but I'm the 
boss.   The difference is the democratic process, he  would  say, 
the  voters  elect  me by a majority to  institute  a  benevolent 
oligarchy.  And I, he pointed at himself, am the oligarch. 

Paul Trump continued.  "In reality sir, NIST has tried to cooper-
ate  with  NSA in a number of programs to raise the  security  of 
many sectors of the government, but, in all fairness, NSA has put 
up constant roadblocks in the name of national security.  The CMR 
problem  for  the commercial sector has been  completely  ignored 
under the cloak of classified specifications."  

"TEMPEST is a classified program . . ."  Marvin objected  strenu-
ously.

"Because  you  want  it to be," Trump  retorted  instantly.   "It 
doesn't  have  to be, and you know it.  Sir," he  turned  to  the 
President.   "TEMPEST  is . . ."  The President  nodded  that  he 
knew.  "The specification for TEMPEST may have been considered  a 
legitimate  secret  when the program started in the  '70's.   But 
now, the private sector is publishing their own results of  stud-
ies  duplicating  what  we did 20 years ago.   The  Germans,  the 
Dutch,  the French, just about everybody but the English  and  us 
has  admitted  that CMR is a problem for everyone, not  just  the 
military.   Jesus,  you  can buy anti-Tempest  plans  in  Popular 
Science.  Because of NSA's protectiveness of a secret that is  no 
longer  a secret, the entire private sector is vulnerable to  CMR 
and  anti-TEMPEST assaults.  As a country, we have no  electronic 
privacy."

Marvin  nodded  in agreement.  "You're damn right we  keep  it  a 
secret.   Why  the hell should we tell the world how  to  protect 
against  it?  By doing that, we not only define the exact  degree 
of  our own exposure, but teach our enemies how to protect  them-
selves.  It should be classified."

"And everyone else be damned?"  Trump challenged Jacobs.

"I  wouldn't  put it that way, but NSA is a DoD  oriented  agency 
after all.  Ask Congress," Marvin said resolutely.

"That's the most alienating, arrogant isolationist attitude  I've 
ever heard," Paul Trump said.  "Regardless of what you may think, 
the  NSA  is not the end-all be-all, and as you  so  conveniently 
dismiss, the NSA is not trusted by many outside the U.S..  We  do 
not have a technology monopoly on TEMPEST any more than we do  on 
the  air  we  breathe."  Trump threw up  his  hands  in  disgust.  
"Patently absurd paranoia . . ."

"Paul,  you don't have all the facts . . ." objected Marv  to  no 
avail.  Trump was a master at debate. 

"Sir,"  Trump again turned from the argumentative Jacobs  to  the 
President.   "I  don't think this is proper forum  for  rehashing 
history, but it should be noted that NIST is responsible for non-
defense  computer security, and we have a staff and  budget  less 
than 1% of theirs.  The job just isn't getting done.  Personally, 
I  consider the state of security within the government to be  in 
total chaos.  The private sector is in even worse shape, and it's 
our own fault."

"Phil?" the President said. "Emergency funding. Congress."   Phil 
nodded  as the debate continued.  "None of this is saying a  damn 
thing  about what we should do.  How do we best defend?"  He  bit 
off  the end of crispy slice of bacon waiting for the  answer  he 
knew would be unsatisfactory.

"We improvise."

"Improvise!  That's  the best you can do?"  The  President  threw 
down  his napkin and it slipped off the table to the floor as  he 
shoved his chair back.  

"This  country  is  run by goddamned  computers,"  the  President 
muttered  loudly as he paced the breakfast room.  Those  who  had 
been eating ceased long ago.  "Goddamned computers and morons."

     SPREADSHEETS STOP CRUNCHING
     LOTUS AND MICROSOFT STRUCK
     by Scott Mason

Last weekend's threats made by the late OSO Industries  Chairman, 
Taki Homosoto appear to be a trustworthy mirror of the future.

Lotus Development Corporation and Microsoft, two of the  software 
industry's  shining  stars are the latest victims  of  Homosoto's 
vengeful attack upon the computer systems of the United States. 

With  cases  of 20-20 hindsight proliferating,  security  experts 
claim that we should have seen it coming. 

The  last  several months has been filled with a long  series  of 
colossal computer failures, massive virus attacks and the magnet-
ic  bombing  of major computer installations.   These  apparently 
unrelated computer crimes, occurring with unprecedented frequency 
have  the distinct flavor of a prelude to the  promises  Homosoto 
made  in the self penned note that accompanied his  seeming  sui-
cide.  

The  latest virus debacle comes immediately on the heels  of  the 
announcement of the dGraph infections.

Yesterday,  Lotus and Microsoft and their dealers were  inundated 
with technical support calls.  According to reports, the industry 
standard  1-2-3  and  the popular Excel  spreadsheets  have  been 
experiencing  cataclysmic  failures in the field.   Typical  com-
plaints  claim the powerful spreadsheet programs  are  performing 
basic  mathematical functions incorrectly; a  veritable  disaster 
for anyone who relies upon the accuracy of their numbers.  

The leading theory held by both companies as well as software and 
security  experts, is that a highly targeted computer  virus  was 
designed  to only affect Lotus and Microsoft  spreadsheet  files.  
While  some viruses are designed to erase files, or  entire  hard 
disks,  the  Lotus Virus as it has been informally  named,  is  a 
highly  sophisticated virus designed only to make subtle  changes 
in the results of mathematical calculations.

Viruses  of  this type are known as Slight  Viruses.   They  only 
infect  small portions of the computer or program, and then  only 
in ways that will hopefully not be detected for some time -  thus 
compounding the damage.

Fortune  100  companies  that use either 1-2-3  or  Excel  nearly 
unanimously announced that they will put a moratorium on the  use 
of  both  programs  until further  notice.   Gibraltar  Insurance 
issued a terse statement:  "Due to the potential damage caused by 
the offending software, we will immediately begin installation of 
compatible  spreadsheet programs and verify the accuracy  of  all 
data.  Our attorneys are studying the matter at this time."

Lotus and Microsoft stock plummeted 36% and 27% respectively.

GOOD ARTICLE.  DO YOU WANT TO GET IT RIGHT NOW?

I see humility reigns right up there with responsibility.

THE  FIRST LOTUS VIRUSES WERE WRITTEN IN LATE 1988.   CUTE,  HUH?  
THE LONGEST VIRUS INCUBATION PERIOD EVER!

Not many people share your sense of achievement.

I DON'T EXPECT SO.  

We should get something straight right off.

ARE YOU SAVING?

I  am  now.   I do not approve, in fact I despise  what  you  say 
you've done.

I AM NOT LOOKING FOR APPROVAL.  MAYBE UNDERSTANDING.

Not from me.

YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.  IF WE DO THIS, YOU NEED TO PRESENT BOTH 
SIDES.  IT'S TO YOUR BENEFIT.  YOU'RE GOING FOR A PULITZER.

Don't tell me how to do my job.  

LET'S GET TO IT.

Fine.  Where did I go wrong in the article?

NOT WRONG, INCOMPLETE.  THERE ARE REALLY 6 VERSIONS OF THE  LOTUS 
VIRUS.  ONLY THE FIRST ONE HAS BEEN DETECTED.  THE OTHERS  AREN'T 
SET TO GO OFF UNTIL LOTUS HAS TIME TO CLEAN UP THE FIRST MESS.

You mean you built several viruses all aimed at Lotus programs?

AND  MICROSOFT,  ASHTON TATE, BORLAND, CA, NOVELL,  LAN  MANAGER, 
WORDPERFECT,  AND A WHOLE BUNCH MORE.  THE LIST WAS OVER  100  TO 
BEGIN WITH.

100?  How many viruses?  When?  

SLIGHT  VIRUSES!  I LOVE IT.  WHAT A NAME.  LIKE I  SAID,  YOU'RE 
GOOD.   I GUESS 500.  MAYBE MORE.  THEY'RE SET TO GO OFF FOR  THE 
NEXT  TWO  YEARS.  TIME RELEASED.  TIME RELEASE  SLIGHT  VIRUSES. 
WHEW!

Why?  Why tell me now?

SLOW DOWN.  NOT ALL AT ONCE.  FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO BUILD  YOU 
A LITTLE CREDIBILITY.  CONVINCE YOUR PUBLIC THAT I AM WHO I SAY I 
AM AND THAT I CANNOT BE TOUCHED.  SO HERE'S THE FIRST LOTUS VIRUS 
SIGNATURE  - THE CURRENT ONE:  05 55 EF E0 F4 D8 6C 41 44 40  4D.   
IN  COMPUTERS THAT ARE INFECTED, BUT HAVEN'T YET STRUCK YET,  THE 
VIRUS  IS  TWO HIDDEN FILES:  ONE SHORT  ONE  NAMED  7610012.EXE.  
IT'S  ONLY 312 BYTES LONG AND HIDES ITSELF IN THE ROOT  DIRECTORY 
BY  LOOKING  LIKE A BAD CLUSTER TO THE SYSTEM.  IT'S  NEVER  EVEN 
NOTICED.  WHEN THE TIME COMES, IT AWAKENS THE SECOND PART OF  THE 
VIRUS, 7610013.EXE WHICH IS SAVED IN A HIDDEN DIRECTORY AND LOOKS 
LIKE  BAD  SECTORS.  ONLY A FEW K.  THAT'S THE FILE  THAT  SCREWS 
AROUND WITH 123 MATH FUNCTIONS.  AFTER 123 IS INFECTED, THE  FILE 
LENGTH  STILL  SAYS IT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED AND THE  VIRUS  ERASES 
ITSELF  AND  RETURNS THE SECTORS TO THE DISK.  IN  THE  MEANTIME, 
LOTUS IS SHOT AND IT IS INFECTING OTHER PROGRAMS.  BRILLIANT IF I 
SAY SO MYSELF.

And you want me to print this?  Why?

IT WILL GIVE YOU AND ME CREDIBILITY.  YOU'LL BE BELIEVED AND THAT 
IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  WE HAVE TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.  

What from happening?

THE FULL ATTACK.  IT CAN'T BE TOTALLY STOPPED, BUT I CAN HELP.

How much of an attack?  

YOU  HAVE  NO  IDEA.  NO IDEA AT ALL.  THERE  WERE  THOUSANDS  OF 
PEOPLE  INVOLVED  AND NOW IT'S ON AUTOPILOT.  THERE'S NO  WAY  TO 
TURN IT OFF.

That's  incredible  . . .more than incredible.   Why?   For  what 
purpose? 

MAYBE LATER.  THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.  I WILL SAY, THOUGH,  THAT 
I NEVER THOUGHT HOMOSOTO COULD PULL IT OFF.  

So you worked for him?

I  WAS  HIRED BY OSO INDUSTRIES TO WORK ON A SECRET  CONTRACT  TO 
DESIGN  METHODS  TO COMBAT COMPUTER VIRUSES  AND  STUDY  MILITARY 
APPLICATIONS.   AS THE PROJECT CONTINUED, IT TOOK ON A NEW  SCOPE 
AND  WE WERE ASKED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS AND  CONSIDERA-
TIONS IN OUR EQUATIONS.

Equations?

COMPUTER  DESIGN  IS MATHEMATICAL MODELING, SO THERE'S A  LOT  OF 
PENCIL  AND PAPER BEFORE ANYTHING IS EVER BUILT.  WE FIGURED  THE 
EFFECTS  OF MULTIPLE SEQUENCED VIRUSES ON LIMITED TARGET  DEFINI-
TIONS, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICS, DATA  PROPAGATION 
PROBABILITIES.    OUR  CALCULATIONS  INCLUDED   MULTI-DIMENSIONAL 
INTERACTIONS  OF INFECTION SIMULTANEITY.  EVERY  POSSIBILITY  AND 
HOW TO CAUSE THE MOST DAMAGE.

It's  a good thing I kind of understand the  technical  gobbledy- 
gook.

OH,  IN ENGLISH?  WE STUDIED WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ENDLESSLY  THROW 
THOUSANDS OF COMPUTER VIRUSES AT THE UNITED STATES. 

I got that.  So what does happen?

YOU'RE FUCKED FOR LIFE.  ONE VIRUS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.  1000 IS 
FATAL. 

You have a way with words.  

GOD  GIVEN  GIFT.   I GUESS YOU COULD CALL US A  THINK  TANK  FOR 
COMPUTER WARFARE.

So what happens next Mr. Spook?

PATRONIZING, NOW, NOW, NOW.  LET'S SEE HERE (FLIP, FLIP)   SATUR-
DAY,  JANUARY 23, NO, THAT WAS THE STOCK EXCHANGE,   NO  DECEMBER 
11, THE PHONE COMPANY AND FEDERAL EXPRESS . . .

Cocky son of a bitch aren't you?

AH  YES!   HERE IT IS.  MONDAY, JANUARY  25.   SCOTT,  YOU'RE  MY 
FRIEND,  SO LET ME GIVE YOU A TIP.  DON'T TRY TAKING AN  AIRPLANE 
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

Why not?

THE NATIONAL RESERVATION SERVICE COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO BE  VERY, 
VERY SICK.

* * * * *

"Yeah," the deep sleepy voice growled in Scott's ear.  

"Ty, wake up."

"Wha?"

"Tyrone, get up!"  Scott's excited voice caught Tryone's notice.

"Scott," he yawned.  "What's the matter?"  

"Are you awake?"

"Don't  worry, I had to get up to answer the phone."  Then  in  a 
more  muffled voice Scott heard Tyrone say, "no, it's  all  right 
dear.   Go back to sleep, I'll take it in the den."   Tyrone  got 
back on the phone and barked, "hold on."

Scott  paced across his junked up home office, sidestepping  some 
items, stepping on others, until Tyrone came back on the line.

"Shit, man," were Tyrone's first words.  "You have any idea  what 
time it is?"

"Hey,  I'm sorry," Scott said mocking Tyrone's complaint.   "I'll 
write  you  a letter tomorrow and lick a stamp and let  the  Post 
Office take it from there . . ."

"You made your point.  What is it?"

"The airlines are going to be hit next.  Homosoto's next target."

"How the hell would you know that?"

"I've been talking to Foster.  He told me."

"Foster told you what?"

"It's  a  huge attack, an incredibly large computer  attack.   He 
worked  for Homosoto.  But the point is, the  airlines.   They're 
next.  Worse than the radar computer problems."

"Can I get right back to you?"

Waiting  for Ty's call, Scott wrote an article for the  following 
morning's paper and submitted it from home to the office  comput-
er.

                         COMPUTER TERRORISM
     An  Exclusive  Interview With The Man Who Invaded America
     By Scott Mason

The  man who claims to be the technical genius behind the  recent 
wave of Computer Crimes has agreed to tell his story  exclusively 
to the New York City Times. 

Only known as the Spook, a hacker's handle which represents  both 
an  alter-ego  and anonymity, he says that he was hired  by  Taki 
Homosoto, late chairman of OSO Industries to design and prepare a 
massive  assault  against  the computer  systems  of  the  United 
States.

The incredible claims made by the Spook appear to be grounded  in 
fact  and  his first statements alone  were  astounding.   Please 
note,  these are exact quotes from a computer  conversation  with 
the Spook.  

"There will be thousands of viruses.  Thousands of them.  I  have 
to imagine by now that every program in America is infected  with 
ten  different viruses.  There is only one way to stop them  all.  
Never turn on your computers.  

"You  see,  most virus programmers are  searching  for  immediate 
gratification.   They write one and want it to spread real  quick 
and  then  see it blow up.  So most amateur  virus  builders  are 
disappointed  in  the results because they don't  have  patience.  
But we, I had patience.

"To maximize the effects of viruses, you have to give them  time.  
Time  to  spread, to infect.  Many of the viruses that  you  will 
experience are years old.  The older viruses are much cruder than 
those  made recently.  We learned over time to build  better  vi-
ruses.  Our old ones have been dormant for so long, their  conta-
gion is complete and they will be just as effective.

"We  have built and installed the greatest viruses of  all  time.  
Every PC will probably be dead in months if not weeks, unless you 
take  my  advice.  There are also VAX viruses, VMS  viruses,  SUN 
viruses, we even built some for Cray supercomputers, but we don't 
expect much damage from them."

The Spook's next comments were just as startling.

"The blackmail operation was a sham, but a terrific success.   It 
wasn't for the money.  No one ever collected any money, did they?  
It was pure psychological warfare.  Making people distrust  their 
computers,  distrust one another because the computer makes  them 
look like liars.  That was the goal.  The money was a  diversion-
ary tactic.  

"Part of any attack is the need to soften the enemy and terrorism 
is  the  best way to get quick results.  By the  time  the  first 
viruses  came along, whoa!  I bet half the MIS directors  in  the 
country don't know whether they're coming or going."

According  to  the  Spook, he designed the  attack  with  several 
armies to be used for different purposes. 

One  for Propaganda, one for Infiltration and Infection, one  for 
Engineering, one for Communications, and another for Distribution 
and  another  for Manufacturing.  At the  pinnacle  was  Homosoto 
acting as Command and Control.

"I didn't actually infect any computers myself.  We had teams  of 
Groundhogs all too happy to do that for us."

According  to  security experts, Homosoto apparently  employed  a 
complex set of military stratagem in the execution of his attack.  

It  has yet to be determined if the Spook will be of any help  in 
minimizing the effects of the First Computer War. 

Scott finally went to bed.  Tyrone never called him back.

     Thursday, January 21
     New York City

The  cavernous  streets of New York on a cloud  covered  moonless 
night  harbor an eerie aura, reminiscent of the fog laden  alleys 
near  the  London  docks on the Thames in the days  of  Jack  the 
Ripper.   A  constant misty rain gave the city an even  more  de-
pressing  pallor than winter normally brought to the  Big  Apple.  
In other words, the weather was perfect.  

On  the corner of 52nd. and 3rd., in the shadow of  the  Citibank 
tower,  Dennis  Melbourne stuck a magnetic strip ID card  into  a 
Cirrus 24 Hour Bank Teller Machine.  As the machine sucked in the 
card,  the  small screen asked for  the  personal  identification 
number,  the PIN, associated with that particular  card.   Dennis 
entered the requested four digit PIN, 1501.   The teller  whirred 
and asked Dennis which transaction he would like.  

He selected: 

     Checking Balance.  

A few seconds later  $4,356.20 appeared.  Good, Dennis thought.

He then selected:

     Withdrawal - Checking

Dennis  entered, $2,000.00 and the machine display told him  that 
his  request  exceeded the daily withdrawal  limit.   Normal,  he 
thought, as he entered an 8 digit sequence: 00330101.  The super-
visor control override.  

The  teller hummed and thought for a moment, and then  $20  bills 
began  tumbling  out of the "Take Cash" drawer.  One  hundred  of 
them.

The teller asked, "Another Transaction?"  and Dennis chose  'No'.   
He  retrieved the magnetic card from the machine and the  receipt 
of this transaction before grabbing a cab to a subway entrance on 
59th. and Lexington Ave.   The ID card he used was only  designed 
to  be used once, so Dennis saw to it that the card was  cut  and 
disposed of in a subterranean men's room toilet.

Dennis  Melbourne  traveled throughout New York all  night  long, 
emptying Cirrus cash machines of their available funds.  And  the 
next night, and the next.  He netted $246,300 in three days.  All 
told, Cirrus customers in thirty-six states were robbed by Dennis 
Melbourne  and  his scores of accomplices of nearly  $10  Million 
before the banks discovered how it was being done. 

The  Cirrus network and it's thousands of Automatic Tellers  were 
immediately closed.   For the first time in years, America had no 
access to instant cash.

Bank  lines  grew to obscene lengths and the waiting  for  simple 
transactions  was  interminable.   Almost one  half  of  personal 
banking had been done by ATM computer, and now human tellers  had 
to  deal with throngs of customers who had little idea of how  to 
bank with a live person. 

Retail  sales  figures for the week after the ATM  machines  were 
closed  showed a significant decline of 3.2%.  The  Commerce  De-
partment  was demanding action by Treasury who pressured the  FBI 
and  everybody  looked to the White House  for  leadership.   The 
economic impact of immediate cash restriction had been  virtually 
instantaneous;  after  all the U.S. is a culture  of  spontaneity 
demanding  instant  gratification. Cash machines  addressed  that 
cultural personality perfectly.  Now it was gone.

Dennis  Melbourne  knew  that it was time to begin  on  the  MOST 
network.   Then the American Express network.  And he  would  get 
rich in the process.  Ahmed Shah paid him very well.  25% of  the 
take.

     Friday, January 22
     New York City 

"We had to take out the part about the airlines," Higgins said in 
response  to Scott's question about the heavy editing.   To  Hig-
gins'  and Doug's surprise, Scott understood; he didn't put up  a 
stink.

"I  wondered about that," Scott said reflecting back on the  last 
evening.  "Telling too much can be worse than not telling enough.  
Whatever you say, John."

"We decided to let the airlines and the FAA and the NTSB make the 
call."  Higgins and Scott had come to know and respect each other 
quite  well in the last few weeks.  They didn't agree  on  every-
thing,  but  as the incredible story evolved, Higgins  felt  more 
comfortable with less conservative rulings and Scott relinquished 
his  non-negotiable pristine attitude.  At least  they  disagreed 
less often and less loudly.  Although neither one would admit it, 
each made an excellent sounding board for the other - a  valuable 
asset on a story this important.  

Higgins  continued.   "The  airlines are treating it  as  a  bomb 
scare.   Seriously, but quietly.  They have people going  through 
the  systems,  looking for whatever it is you people  look  for."  
Higgins' knowledge of computers was still dismal. 

"Scott, let me ask you something." Doug broke into the  conversa-
tion that like all the others, took place in Higgins' lawyer-like 
office.   They  occurred so often that Scott had  half  seriously 
convinced Higgins' secretary that he wouldn't attend unless there 
were  fresh donuts and juice on the coffee table.   When  Higgins 
found out,  he was mildly annoyed, but nonetheless, in the spirit 
of camaraderie, he let the tradition continue.  "Children will be 
children," he said. 

"How much damage could be done if the Spook's telling the truth?" 
Doug asked.

"Oh,  he's telling the truth," Scott said somberly.  "Don't  for-
get, I know this guy.  He said that the effects would take  weeks 
and  maybe  months to straighten out.  And  the  airline  assault 
would start Monday."

"Why is he being so helpful?"  Higgins asked.

"He  wants  to establish credibility.  He says he wants  to  help 
now, but first he wants to be taken seriously."

"Seriously? Seriously?  He's a terrorist!" shouted Higgins.   "No 
damn  different  than someone who throws a bomb  into  a  crowded 
subway.   You don't negotiate with terrorists!"  He  calmed  him-
self,  not liking to show that degree of emotion.  "But  we  want 
the story . . ." he sighed in resignation.  Doug and Scott agreed 
in unison.

"Personally, it sounds like a macho ego thing," commented Doug.

"So what?" asked Higgins.  "Motivation is independent of premedi-
tation."

"Legally  speaking  . . ."  Doug added.  He wanted to  make  sure 
than  John  was  aware that there were other  than  purely  legal 
issues on the table.

"As  I was saying," Scott continued.  "The reservation  computers 
are  the single most important item in running the nation's  air-
lines.   They  all interact and talk to each  other,  and  create 
billing,  and  schedule  planes; they interface on  line  to  the 
OAG . . .they're the brains.  They all use Fault Tolerant  equip-
ment, that's spares of everything, off site backup of all records 
-  I've checked into it.  Whatever he's planned, it'll be a  doo-
sey."

"Well,  it doesn't matter now," Higgins added with  indifference.  
"Legally  it's  unsubstantiated hearsay.  But with  the  computer 
transcripts  of all your conversations, if anything happens,  I'd 
say you'd have quite a scoop."

"That's what he wants!  And we can't warn anybody?"

"That's  up to the airlines, the FAA, not us." The phone on  Hig-
gins  disk emitted two short warbles.  He spoke into  the  phone. 
"Yeah?  Who? Whooo?"  He held the phone out to Scott  and  curled 
his lips.  "It's for you.  The White House."  Scott glanced  over 
at Doug who raised his bushy white eyebrows.  

Scott picked up the phone on the end table by the leather  couch; 
the  one that Scott seemed to have made a second home.   "Hello?" 
he   asked   hesitantly.    "Yes?    Well,   I   could   be    in 
Washington   . . ." Scott looked over to Doug for  advice.   "The 
President?"  Doug shook his head, yes.  Whatever it is, go.  "I'd 
be  happy  to," he said reading his watch.  "A  few  hours?"   He 
waited a few seconds.  "Yes, I know the number.  Off the  record?  
Fine.  Thank you."

"Well?" asked Higgins.

"The President himself wants to have a little chat with me."

     Friday, January 22
     The White House

Only the President, Musgrave and Henry Kennedy were there to meet 
Scott.   They  did not want to overwhelm him, merely  garner  his 
cooperation.  Scott rushed by cab to the White House from Nation-
al  Airport,  and used the Press Gate even though he had  an  ap-
pointment  with  The Man.  He could have used the  Visitor's  En-
trance.    Scott  was  whisked by White  House  aides  through  a 
"Private"  door in the press room to the surprise of the  regular 
pool  reporters who wondered who dared to so  underdress.   Defi-
nitely not from Washington.

Scott  was  running on short notice, so he was only  wearing  his 
work  clothes: torn blue jeans, a sweatshirt from the nude  beach 
he and Sonja had visited and Reeboks that needed a wash.  January 
was unusually warm, so he got away with wearing his denim  jacket 
filled  with  a  decade of patches  reflecting  Scott's  evolving 
political and social attitudes.  He was going to have to bring  a 
change of clothes to the office from now on.

Before he had a chance to apologize for his appearance, at  least 
he was able to shave the three day old stubble on the train,  the 
President  apologized for the suddenness and hoped it wasn't  too 
much of an inconvenience.  Kennedy and Musgrave kept their smirks 
to  themselves, knowing full well from the very complete  dossier 
on  Scott Mason, that he was having a significant intimate  rela-
tionship  with  one Sonja Lindstrom, here  in  Washington.   Very 
convenient was more like it, they thought.

The  President sat Scott down on the Queen Anne and  complimented 
him  on  his series of articles on computer crime. He  said  that 
Scott  was doing a fine job awakening the public to the  problem, 
and that more people should care, and how brave he was to jump in 
front of flying bullets, and on and on and on.  Due to Henry  and 
Phil's  political savvy and professional discipline,  neither  of 
their faces showed that they both wanted to throw up on the spot.  
This  was  worse  than kissing babies to get  elected.   But  the 
President  of  the  United States wanted a secret  favor  from  a 
journalist, so some softening, some schmoozing was in order.

"Well, let me get right to the point," the President said a  half 
hour  later after two cups of coffee and endless small talk  with 
Scott.   He, too, had wondered what the President wanted so  much 
that  the extended foreplay was necessary.  "I understand  Scott, 
that you have developed quite a rapport with this Spook  fellow."  
He held up a copy of the New York paper headlines blaring: 

          Computer Terrorism - Exclusive.

Aha!  So that's what they want! They want me to turn him in.   "I 
consider  myself  to be very lucky, right place, right  time  and 
all.   Yessir."   Scott downplayed his position  with  convincing 
humility.  "It seems as if he has selected me as his mouthpiece."

"All  we want, in fact, all we can ask," Musgrave said,  "is  for 
you  to  give us information before it's printed."  Scott's  eyes 
shot  up  in defense, protest at the ready.   "No,  no,"  Mugrave 
added quickly.  "Nothing confidential.  We know that Miles Foster 
is the Spook, but we can't prove it without giving away away  too 
many of our secrets." Scott knew they were referring to their own 
electronic  eavesdropping  habits that would be  imprudent  in  a 
court.   "Single handedly he is capable of bringing down half  of 
the government's computers.  We need to know as much as we can as 
fast as we can.  So, whatever you print, we'd like an early  copy 
of it.  That's all."

Scott's mind immediately traveled back to the first and only time 
an article of his was pulled.  At the AG's request.  Of course it 
finally  got  printed, but why the niceties now?  They  can  take 
what  they want, but instead they ask?  Maybe they don't want  to 
get caught fiddling around with the Press too much.  Such activi-
ties  snagged  Nixon, not saying that the  President  was  Nixon-
esque,  but politics is politics.   What do I get in return?   He 
could  hear it now, the '<MI>you'll be helping your  country,<D>' 
speech.   Bargaining  with the President would be gauche  at  the 
least.

So  he proposed to Musgrave instead. "I want an exclusive  inter-
view with the President when this thing is over."

"Done!" said Musgrave too quickly.  Scott immediately  castigated 
himself for not asking for more.  He could shoot himself.  A true 
Washington  denizen would have asked for a seat in  the  Cabinet.  
But that was between Scott and his conscience.  Doug would hear a 
dramatized account.

"And no other media finds out that you know anything until . . ." 
Scott added another minor demand.

"Until the morning papers appear at the back door with the milk," 
joked  Musgrave.  "Scott, this is for internal use  only.   Every 
hour will help."

Scott  was given a secret White House phone number where  someone 
would either receive FAX or E-Mail message. Not the standard  old 
PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV  that any schmo with a PC  could  E-mail 
into.  His was special. Any hour, any day.  He was also  given  a 
White House souvenir pen.

"It  went  fine," Kennedy said to Marvin Jacobs from  his  secure 
office  in the White House basement.   He spoke to Marvin  Jacobs 
up at Fort Meade on the STU-III phones.

"Didn't matter," Marvin said munching on what sounded to  Kennedy 
like an apple. A juicy one.

"What do you mean, it didn't matter?"

"We're  listening to his computers, his phones and his fax  lines 
anyway,"  Marvin said with neutrality. 

"I don't know if I want to know about this . . ."

"It  was just a back up plan,"  Jacobs said with a little  laugh.  
He  wanted  to  defuse Kennedy's panic button.   For  a  National 
Security Advisor, Kennedy didn't know very much about how  intel-
ligence is gathered.  "Just in case."

"Well, we don't need it anymore," Kennedy said.  "Mason is  coop-
erating fully."

"I  like  to have alternatives.  I expect you'll be  telling  the 
President about this."

"Not a chance.  Not a chance."  Kennedy sounded spooked.  

Jacobs  loudly  munched  the last bite through  the  apple  skin.  
"I'll have something else for you on Mason tomorrow.  Let's  keep 
him honest."

     Friday, January 22
     Reston, Virginia

"No, mom, I'm not going to become a spy," Scott calmly said  into 
the  phone while smiling widely at Sonja.  "No, I can't tell  you 
what  he  wanted, but he did give me a present for  you."   Scott 
mouthed the words, 'she's in heaven' to Sonja who enjoyed  seeing 
the  pleasure the woman received from her son's  travels.   "Yes, 
I'll  be  home  in a couple of days,"  he paused  as  his  mother 
interrupted  again.  "Yes, I'll be happy to reprogram  your  VCR. 
I'm sorry it doesn't work . . ."  He sat back to listen for a few 
seconds and watch Sonja undress in front of a full length mirror.  
Their guests were expected in less than 15 minutes and she rushed 
to  make  herself beautiful despite Scott's claims that  she  was 
always beautiful.   "Yes, mom, I'm paying attention. No ma'am,  I 
won't.  Yes, ma'am, I'll try.  O.K., goodnight, I love you."   He 
struggled  to  pull the phone from his ear, but his  mother  kept 
talking.  "Don't worry, mom.  You'll meet her soon."  Finally  he 
was  able  hang up and start worrying about one of  their  dinner 
guests.  Miles Foster.

Scott had told Sonja nothing about Miles.  Or the Spook.  As  far 
as  the world was concerned, they were two different people  with 
different goals, different motivations and different lives.   The 
unresolved  irreconcilliation  between  the two  faces  of  Miles 
Foster put Scott on edge, though.  Does he treat Miles like Miles 
or  like the Spook?  Or is the Spook coming to dinner instead  of 
Miles.   Does  he  then treat the Spook like the  Spook  or  like 
Miles? 

In kind, Sonja had not told Scott that she had been hired to meet 
him,  nor that she had quit after meeting him.  The  night  Miles 
was  arrested, she had successfully evaded his queries about  her 
professional  PR  functions. Scott accepted at  face  value  that 
Sonja was between jobs.

She  had  made a lot of money from Alex and his  references,  but 
that was the past.  She had no desire to be dishonest with Scott, 
on  the contrary.  It was not an easy topic to  broach,  however, 
and if things between them got beyond the frenzied sexual savage-
ry stage, she would have to test the relationship.  But not yet.

The doorbell of Sonja's lakefront Whisper Way townhouse in Reston 
rang before either she or Scott were ready, so Scott  volunteered 
for first shift host and bartender duty.  He took a deep  breath, 
ready for another unpredictable evening, and opened the door.

"Scott," Stephanie Perkins said putting her arms around his neck.  
"Welcome  back.   It's  good to see you."   The  three  of  them, 
Stephanie,  Sonja and Scott had gotten along very  well.   "Maybe 
Miles  can see his way clear to spend the entire evening with  us 
tonight," she said teasing Miles.

Miles  ignored Perky's shot at him and brushed it  aside  without 
comment.  Apparently he had provided Stephanie with an acceptable 
excuse for getting arrested by the FBI.  So be it far from  Scott 
to  bring  up a subject that might ruffle the  romantic  feathers 
which in turn were likely to ruffle the feathers of his source.

Miles  dressed in summer khaki pants, a  yachtsman's  windbreaker 
and  topsiders  without  socks; the most casual  Scott  had  seen 
either the Spook or Miles.  Scott prepared the drinks and Stepha-
nie went upstairs with her glass of wine to see Sonja and let the 
boys  finish  their shop talk.   Miles opened the  sliding  glass 
doors to the deck overlooking the fairly large man-made lake.

"I won't ask," Scott said as soon as Stephanie's feet disappeared 
from view on the elegant spiral staircase to the second floor.

"Thanks.   And, by the way, Perky probably doesn't need  to  hear 
too  much  about Amsterdam," Miles said with  a  mildly  sinister 
touch.  

"We used to call it the rules of the road," Scott remembered.

"I call it survival.  Christ, sometimes I get so fucking horny, I 
swear the crack of dawn is in trouble."

Scott's  mind played with the varied imagery of  Miles'  creative 
phraseology.  The name was different, he thought, but the charac-
ter was the same.  

"You  know," Scott said as the two stood on the deck,  drinks  in 
hand, soaking up the brisk lake air.  "I really don't  understand 
you."

"What's  to understand?"  Miles' gaze remained constant over  the 
moonlit water.

"I see that you weren't overly detained the other evening."

"No reason to be.  It was a terrible mistake.  They must have  me 
confused with someone else."  Miles played dead pan.

"You  know what I'm talking about," urged Scott.  "The Spook  and 
all that  . . ."

"Fuck  you!"  Miles turned and yelled with hostility.  He  placed 
the glass of Glenfiddich on the railing and pointed his  forefin-
ger in Scott's face.  "You're getting what you want, so back  the 
fuck off.  Got it?"

Scott's  blood  pressure joined his fight or flight  response  in 
panic.   Was  this  the Mr. Hyde of Miles Foster?   Or  the  real 
Spook?  Had he blown it?  

Just then, the sliding glass door from the living room opened and 
Sonja  and  Stephanie shivered at the first cool  gust  of  wind.  
Miles  instantly  swept  Stephanie in his arms and  gave  her  an 
obscene sounding kiss.  His face emerged from the lip melee  with 
no  trace of anger, no trace of displeasure.  The sinister  Miles 
was magically transformed into Miles the lover.  

He had had no chance to respond to Miles' outburst, so Scott  was 
caught with his jaw hung open.

"You  boys finish shop yet?"  Stephanie said nuzzling  at  Miles' 
ear.

"We were just discussing the biographical inconsistencies in  the 
annotated  history  of Alfred E. Neumann's early  years,"   Miles 
said convincingly.  He glanced over at Scott with a wise cracking 
dimple  filled  smile.   "We disagree on the exact  date  of  his 
second bris."  

Incredible, thought Scott.  The ultimate chameleon.  

Gullibility  was one of Stephanie's long suits, so  Sonja  helped 
out.   "That's  right  up there with the bathing  habits  of  the 
Jamaican bobsled team."  

"C'mon,"  Stephanie  said  tugging at Miles.   "It's  chilly  out 
here."

Dumbfounded,  Scott  shrugged  at Miles when  the  girls  weren't 
looking.  Whatever you want.  It's your game.  Miles mouthed back 
at Scott, 'you're fucking right it is.'

The  remainder of the evening comprised a little  of  everything.  
Except  computers.  And computer crime.  And any  political  talk 
that  might lead to either of the first two no-nos.   They  dined 
elegantly,  drank expensive French wine and overindulged in  Mar-
tel.  It was the perfect social evening between four friends.

     HARDWARE VIRUSES: A NEW TWIST
     By Scott Mason

In  conversations  with the Spook, the man who claims to  be  the 
technical  genius  behind the Homosoto Invasion, I  have  learned 
that there are even more menacing types of computer viruses  than 
those commonly associated with infected software programs.   They 
are  hardware viruses; viruses built right into the  electronics.  
The  underground  computer culture calls the elite  designers  of 
hardware  viruses Chippers.  It should come as no  surprise  then 
that  Chipping was a practice exploited by Homosoto and his  band 
under the wizardry of the Spook.

Chippers  are a very specialized group of what I would have  once 
called  hackers, but whom now many refer to as terrorists.   They 
design  and build integrated circuits, chips, the brains of  toys 
and  computers, to purposefully malfunction.  The chips  are  de-
signed to either simply stop working, cause intentional random or 
persistent  errors and even cause physical damage to other  elec-
tronic circuits.

You ask, is all of this really possible?  Yes, it is possible, it 
is occurring right now, and there is good reason to suspect  that 
huge  numbers  of electronic VCR's,  cameras,  microwaves,  clock 
radios and military systems are a disaster waiting to happen.

It  takes  a great many resources to build a chip -  millions  of 
dollars  in  sophisticated test equipment, lasers,  clean  rooms, 
electron beam microscopes and dozens of PhD's in dozens of disci-
plines to run it all.

According  to  the  Spook,  OSO Industries  built  millions  upon 
millions of integrated circuits that are programmed to fail.   He 
said,  "I  personally headed up that portion of  the  engineering 
design  team.   The  techniques for  building  and  disguising  a  
Trojan  Chip were all mine.  I originally suggested  the idea  in 
jest,  saying  that  if someone really wanted  to  cause  damage, 
that's  what  they would do.  Homosoto didn't even blink  at  the 
cost.  Twelve million dollars."

When  asked  if  he knew when the chips would  start  failing  he 
responded,  "I  don't know the exact dates because  anyone  could 
easily add or change a date or event trigger.  But I would  guess 
that based upon timing of the other parts of the plan,  seemingly 
isolated  electronic systems will begin to fail in the  next  few 
months.  But, that's only a guess."

The  most damaging types of Trojan Chips are those  that  already 
have  a lot of room for memory.  The Spook described  how  mostly 
static  RAM, (Random Access Memory) chips and various ROM  chips, 
(Read Only Memory) such as UV-EPROM and EEPROM were used to house 
the  destructive instructions for later release in computer  sys-
tems.

"It's really simple.  There are always thousands of unused  gates 
in every IC.  Banks and banks of memory for the taking.  Homosoto 
was  no slouch, and he recognized that hardware viruses  are  the 
ultimate  in underground computer warfare.  Even better than  the 
original  Trojan  Horse.  No messy software to worry  about,  and 
extensive  collateral  damage to  nearby  electronic  components.  
Makes repairs terrifically expensive."

Which chips are to be considered suspect?  The Spook was clear.

"Any  RAM  or ROM chips with the OSO logo and a date  code  after 
1/89  are  potentially  dangerous.  They should  be  swapped  out 
immediately for new, uninfected components.  Also, OSO sold their 
chips, in die form, to other manufacturers to put their own names 
on them.  I wish I  knew to whom, but Homosoto's firm handled all 
of that."

The Spook also said to beware of any electronic device using  OSO 
labeled or OSO made LS logic chips.   Hundreds of millions of the 
LS logic chips, the so called Glue of electronics, are sold every 
year.  In the electronics world they are considered  'dime-store' 
parts,  selling for a few pennies each.  However, in  most  elec-
tronic  systems, an inexpensive component failure is just as  bad 
as  an  expensive component failure.  In either  case,  it  stops 
working.

The  Spook  continues:  "The idea was to build a  small  timebomb 
into  VCR's,  televisions and radios.  Not  only  computers,  but 
alarm  systems,  cash registers, video games, blowing up  all  at 
once. At times it got very funny. Imagine dishwashers spitting up 
gallons of suds in kitchens everywhere.  The ovens will be  cook-
ing  pork tartar and toast a la burnt.  What happens when  Betty-
Jean doesn't trust her appliances any more?    The return line at 
Sears will be a week long."  

I  asked the Spook how this was possible?  How could  he  inflict 
such damage without anyone noticing?  His answer is as  indicting 
as  is  his  guilt.  "No one checks.  If the chip  passes  a  few 
simple  tests, it's put into a calculator or a clock or  a  tele-
phone  or  an  airplane.  No one expects the chip  to  be  hiding 
something  destructive,  so no one looks for it.   Not  even  the 
military  check.   They just expect their chips to  work  in  the 
frozen  depths of space and survive a nuclear blast.  They  don't 
expect a virus to be lurking."

No  matter what one thinks of the nameless, faceless  person  who 
hides behind the anonymity of these computerized confessions, one 
has  to agree that the man known as the Spook has  awakened  this 
world to many of the dangers that unbridled technical proficiency 
brings.   Have we taken too much liberty without the  concomitant 
responsibility?   I know that I find I wish I could run parts  of 
my  life  in fast forward.  Sitting in a movie  theater,  I  feel 
myself tense as I realize I cannot speed up the slow parts.   Has 
the infinite flexibility we have given ourselves outpaced  social 
conscience?  

Ironically, conversations with the Spook tended to be impersonal; 
not machine-like, but devoid of concern for people.  I asked  him 
if he cared.

"That  was  not the idea, as far as I know.  In a  way  this  was 
electronic  warfare, in the true sense of the  word.   Collateral 
damage is unavoidable." 

Hardware  viruses  in addition to software viruses.   Is  nothing 
sacred?

     Sunday, January 24
     Washington, D.C.

"Does he know what he's saying?"  Henry Kennedy said doubtfully.

"I think so, and I also think it's a brilliant way to put a  huge 
dent  in the Japanese monopoly on integrated  circuits."   Marvin 
Jacobs  had an office installed not two doors from  Kennedy's  in 
the subterranean mazes beneath the White House lawn.

"He can't blame the Japanese for everything."

"Don't  you see? He's not?  All he's saying is that OSO  did  it, 
and he's letting the Japanese national guilt by association  take 
its  course."   Jacobs seemed pleased.   "Mason's  chippers  will 
cast  a shadow of doubt on everything electronic made  in  Japan.  
If it has OSO's name on it, it'll be taboo.  Toshiba, Mitsubishi, 
Matsushita  . . .all the big Nippon names will be  tarnished  for 
years."

"And you actually want this to happen?" asked Henry.

"I  didn't say that," Marvin said slithering away from  a  policy 
opinion.   "Hey, what are you complaining about?  Mason  gave  us 
the article like you wanted, didn't he?"

"I told you there were other ways,"  Kennedy shot back.

"Well, for your information, there's a little more that he didn't 
tell us about," said Jacobs haughtily.

"And how did you find out?  Pray tell?"

Marvin  grinned  devilishly before answering.   "CMR.   Van  Eck.  
Whatever.  We have Mason covered."

"You're using the same . . ."

"Which is exactly how we're going to fight these bastards."

"At the expense of privacy?"

"There is no clear cut legal status of electromagnetic emanations 
from computers," Marv said defensively.  "Are they private?   Are 
they free to anyone with a receiver, like a radio or TV?  No  one 
has tested the theory yet.  And that's not to say we've tried  to 
publicize it.  The FCC ruled in 1990 that eavesdropping on cellu-
lar telephone calls was legal.  By anyone, even the  government."  
Marvin was giving a most questionable technical practice an  aura 
of  respectability  hidden  behind the legal  guise  of  freedom.  
Kennedy  was uncomfortable with the situation, but in this  case, 
Marv had the President's ear.

"And screw privacy, right? All in the name of national security."  
Henry did not approve of Marvin's tactics.

"It's  been  done before and it'll be done  again,"  Marvin  said 
fairly unconcerned with Kennedy's opinions and whining.   "Citing 
National   Security   is   a   great   antidote   to    political 
inconvenience."

"I  don't agree with you, not one iota!" blasted Kennedy.   "This 
is a democracy, and with that comes the good and the bad, and one 
premise  of  a democracy is the right to  privacy.   That's  what 
shredded Nixon.  Phone taps, all the time, phone taps."

"Henry,  Henry,"  begged Marv to his old time, but  more  liberal 
minded  friend.  "This is legal."  Marvin's almost  wicked  smile 
was not contagious.  "It's not illegal either."  

Kennedy  frown  deeply.  "I think you take the NSA's  charter  as 
national listening post to an extreme," he said somberly.

"Henry, Are you going to fight me on this?" Marv asked finally.

"No," sighed Henry Kennedy.  "The President gave you the task,  I 
heard him, and I'm here to support his efforts.  I don't have  to 
agree . . .but it would help."  

* * * * *

"Don't  worry.   The speech will make him sound like  an  expert, 
like  he  actually knows what he talking about.  Not  a  man  who 
thinks Nintendo is Japanese slang for nincompoop." Phil  Musgrave 
called Henry Kennedy's office in the basement.

Phil  joked with Henry about the President's legendary  technical 
ineptness.  One time while giving a speech to the VFW, the  sound 
went  out.   Trying  to be helpful, the  President  succeeded  in 
plugging  an 'in' into an 'out' which resulted in a minor  amount 
of  smoke, an embarrassing false security alert, and  the  subse-
quent loss of any sound reinforcement at all. 

"You  know how I feel about him, Phil," said Henry with  concern.  
"I  support him 110%.  But this is a new area for all of us.   We 
don't  have  the contingency plans.  Defense hasn't  spent  years 
studying  the problem and working out the options or the  various 
scenarios.  Phil, until recently viruses and hackers were consid-
ered a non-problem in the big picture."

"I  know, Henry, I know, but the politicians had to rely  on  the 
experts, and they argued and argued and procrastinated . . ."

"And Congress, as usual, didn't do shit."  Kennedy completed  the 
statement.   "That doesn't change the fact that he's winging  it.  
Christ,  we don't even know the questions much less  the  answers 
and,   well,  we know he calls 911 to change a  lightbulb."   His 
affection  for the President was clear through the  barb.    "And 
you know what really pisses me off?"

"What's that?"

"Jacobs.  He seems pleased with the turn of events."

"He  should,"  agreed Phil nonchalantly.  "He just  won  a  major 
battle.  He's got security back under his thumb.  A nice  politi-
cal coup."

"No,  not that," Henry said cautiously.  "It's just that I  think 
he's acting too much the part of the renegade.  Do you know  what 
I mean?"

"No,  not at all," laughed Phil.  "He's just playing it his  way, 
not anyone elses.  C'mon, now, you know that."

"I guess . . ."

"Besides,  Henry," he said glancing at his watch.  "It's  getting 
to  be  that time."   They agreed to watch the  speech  from  the 
sidelines,  so they could see how the President's  comments  were 
greeted by the press.

"Ladies  and Gentlemen, the President of the United States."   An 
assistant  White House press agent made the announcement  to  the 
attendant Washington press pool.   The video was picked up by the 
CNN  cameras as it was their turn to provide a feed to the  other 
networks.  Sunday evening was an odd time to call a press confer-
ence,  but everyone had a pretty good idea that the  subject  was 
going  to  be computers.  Thus far, government  comments  on  the 
crisis had come from everywhere but the White House.

The  President  rapidly ambled up to the podium  and  placed  his 
notes before him.  He put on his glasses and stared at the camera 
somberly.  It was speeches that began this way, without a  prean-
nounced  subject matter, that caused most Americans who  grew  up 
during  the  Cold War to experience a sinking  feeling  in  their 
stomachs.   They still thought about the unthinkable.   As  usual 
the press corps was rapt with attention.

"Good evening," the President of the United States began  slowly.  
"I am speaking to you tonight on a matter of great concern to  us 
all.   A subject of the utmost urgency to which we must   address 
ourselves immediately.

"That subject is, information.  The value of information.

"As  I  am sure most of you are aware,  one man,  Taki  Homosoto, 
threatened  the United States this last week.  It is  about  that 
very subject that I wish to speak to the country, and the world."  
The  President paused.  He had just told the country what he  was 
going to say.  Now he had to say it.  

"For  all practical purposes, the United States is undergoing  an 
electronic  Pearl Harbor, and the target is one of the most  cru-
cial segments of our way of life:  Information. 

"Information.  What is information?  Information is news.  Infor-
mation  is a book, or a movie or a television show.   Information 
is  a  picture, it's a word and it's a gesture.   Information  is 
also a thought.  A pure idea.  

"Information  is the single commodity, a common denominator  upon 
which all industrial societies must rely.  Data, facts, opinions, 
pictures, histories, records, charts, numbers.  Whether that data 
is raw in nature, such as names, addresses and phone numbers,  or 
it  consists  of secret governmental strategies and  policies  or 
proprietary  business  details, information is the  key  building 
block upon which modern society functions.  

"Information is the lifeblood of the United States and the world.

"As first steam, and then coal and then gas and oil, now informa-
tion   has  become  an integral driving  force  of  the  economy.  
Without  information,  our systems begin to  collapse.   How  can 
modern  society  function without information and  the  computers 
that  make America what it is?   Effectively there are no  longer 
any nationalistic boundaries that governments create. Information 
has  become a global commodity.  What would our  respective  cul-
tures look like if information was no longer available?  

"We would not be able to predict the weather.  Credit cards would 
be worthless pieces of plastic.  We would save less lives without 
enough information and the means to analyze it.  We need  massive 
amounts  of information to make informed decisions in  government 
policies and actions.  

"What if banks could no longer transfer money because the comput-
ers were empty? How could the airlines fly if there were no  pas-
senger records?  What good is an insurance company if its clients 
names are nowhere on file?  If there was no phone book, who could 
you  call?   If hospitals had no files on your  medical  history, 
what treatment is required?  With a little effort, one can  imag-
ine how difficult it would be to run this planet without informa-
tion.

"Information, in short, is both a  global and a national  strate-
gic asset that is currently under attack.   

"Information and the information processing industry has come  to 
represent  a  highly  significant piece  of  our  gross  national 
product;  indeed,  the  way we live as  Americans,  enjoying  the 
highest standard of living in the world, is due in large part  to 
the extraordinary ability of having information at our fingertips 
in  a second's notice.  Anything we want in the form of  informa-
tion  can literally be brought into our homes; cable  television, 
direct satellite connections from the back yard.  The Library  of 
Congress, and a thousand and one other sources of information are 
at our fingertips from our living room chair.

"Without  information,  without  the machinery  that  allows  the 
information to remain available, a veritable national  electronic 
library, the United States steps back thirty years.  

"Information is as much a strategic weapon in today's world as is 
the gun or other conventional armaments.  Corporate successes are 
often  based  upon well organized data banks and  analytic  tech-
niques.   Government  functions, and assuredly the Cold  War  was 
fought,  on the premise that one side has more accurate  informa-
tion than its adversary.  Certainly academia requires the  avail-
ability  of information across all disciplines.  Too, the  public 
in  general relies upon widespread dissemination  of  information 
for even the simplest day to day activities.

"It  is  almost inconceivable that society could function  as  we 
know it without the data processing systems upon which we rely.

"It  is  with these thoughts that those more expert  than  I  can 
speak at length, but we must realize and accept the responsibili-
ty for protecting that information.  Unfortunately, we as  trust-
ing  Americans, have allowed a complacency to overshadow  prudent 
pragmatism.  

"Over  the  last weeks we have begun to see the  results  of  our 
complacency.  The veins of the nation, the free flow of  informa-
tion, is being poisoned.

"Both the government and the private sector are to blame for  our 
state  of disarray and lack of preparedness in dealing  with  the 
current crisis.  We must be willing, individually and collective-
ly,  to  admit that we are all at fault,  then we  must  fix  the 
problem, make the sacrifice and then put it behind us.  

"It is impossible for the Government to deny that we have  failed 
miserably in our information security and privacy implementation.   
Likewise,  the  value of the accumulation of information  by  the 
private  sector was overlooked by everybody.  Fifteen years  ago, 
who  could have possibly imagined that the number  of  businesses 
relying on computers would have jumped more than a hundred  thou-
sand fold.

"Today,   the  backbone  of  America,  the   small   businessman, 
20,000,000 strong, the one man shop, provides more jobs than  the 
Fortune  1000.   And, the small businessman has come to  rely  on 
his computer as Big Business has for decades.  His survival,  his 
success  is  as critical to the stability of the  United  States' 
economy  as  is a General Motors or an IBM.  We must  defend  the 
small  business  as surely as we must  defend  our  international 
competitiveness of industrial leaders.

"The  wealth  of this country was once in steel  mills,  in  auto 
plants,  in  manufacturing.   The products built  by  the  United 
States  were  second  to none.  Made in the U.S.A.  was  a  proud 
label,  one that carried a premium worldwide.  Our  technological 
leadership  has never been in question and has been the  envy  of 
the world for over 200 years.  Franklin, Fulton and Edison.   The 
Wright  Brothers, Westinghouse, Ford.  As a nation the  Manhattan 
Project reaffirmed our leadership.  Then Yaeger and the speed  of 
sound.  The transistor.  DNA decoded.  The microchip.  The  Moon.  
The computer.

"Yet there was a subtle shift occurring that escaped all but  the 
most vigilant.  We were making less things, our concentration  on 
manufacturing  was slowly shifting to an emphasis on  technology.  
Communications,  computers.  Information processing.   No  longer 
are cities built around smokestacks spewing forth the  byproducts 
of  the manufacturing process.  Instead, industrial parks  sprout 
in   garden-like  settings  that  encourage  mental   creativity.   
Fifteen percent of the American workforce no longer drive to  the 
office. They commute via their computers at home.

"The  excitement of the breakneck pace of technology  masked  the 
danger in which we were placing ourselves.  Without realizing it, 
a  bulk of this nation's tangible wealth was being moved  to  the 
contents  of  a computer's memory.   We took  those  first  steps 
toward computerization hesitantly; we didn't trust the  computer.  
It  was  unfamiliar, foreign, alien.  But when  we  embraced  the 
computer, we unquestioningly entrusted it with out most  precious 
secrets.  

"Unlike the factory though, with the fence, the gates, the  dogs, 
the alarms and the night guards, we left our computers unprotect-
ed.    Growing bigger and faster computers took  precedence  over 
protecting their contents.  

"We  were  warned, many times.  But, as I said  earlier,  neither 
your  government  nor its constituency heeded the  warnings  with 
enough diligence.  Protection of government information became  a 
back-burner issue, a political hot cake, that in budget crunches, 
was  easy to overlook.  Overclassification of information  became 
the  case of the 'The Spy Who Cried Wolf.'    The  classification 
system has been abused and clearly does not serve us well.  At my 
direction it will receive a thorough overhaul.

"Personal  privacy has been ignored.  Your government is in  pos-
session  of  huge amounts of data and yet there is no  effort  at 
protecting  the  non-classified  privacy of  individuals  in  our 
computers.

"The private sector faces another dilemma.  The  unresponsiveness 
of the Federal Government to  the protection of its own  informa-
tion  did not set a good example for industry, and their  comput-
ers, too, remained vulnerable.  

The  President paused from reading his speech to pour a glass  of 
ice water.

"Nothing  can stop the fact that the United States is  under  at-
tack.   Nothing  can change the fact that the  attack  cannot  be 
turned  away.  And nothing can change the fact that America  will 
suffer  significant disruptions and inconvenience for some  time. 
But we can minimize the damage.  We can prepare for the  inevita-
ble obstacles we will face.

"The  poison that Mr. Homosoto put into the American  information 
society is the equivalent of electronic biological warfare.    He 
has  senselessly  and vengefully struck out  against  the  United 
States in a manner that I describe as an act of war.

"In  order to deal with this real threat to the security  of  the 
United  States  of America, I have taken several steps  that  are 
designed to assist in weathering the storm.

"First,  I  am assigning the Director of  the  National  Security 
Agency  to coordinate all efforts at defending against and  mini-
mizing the effects of the current crisis.  The NSA has the  expe-
rience and resources, and the support of this President to manage 
an  operation  of this complexity and importance.   In  addition, 
representatives  from GCHQ in the United Kingdom and other  ITSEC 
members from Germany, France and Holland will coordinate European 
defensive strategies.

"Second, I am activating the following four groups to assist  the 
NSA in their efforts.  ECCO, the Emergency Computer Crisis Organ-
ization,  has  acted as an advisor to  law  enforcement  agencies 
across  the  country and has been instrumental in  providing  the 
technical  support  to the FBI and the Secret  Service  in  their 
computer crime investigations.

"CERT,  the Computer Emergency Response Team was created  by  the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as an outgrowth of  the 
1988  INTERNET Worm incident.  Carnegie Mellon  University  where 
CERT  is  headquartered has donated the facilities and  staff  of 
their Software Engineering Institute to deal with the invasion of 
our computers.

"The Defense Data Network Security Coordination Center was  based 
at the Stanford Research Institute by the Defense  Communications 
Agency  to  coordinate attacks  against  non-classified  computer 
systems.

"Lastly, CIAC, the Computer Incident Advisory Capability  manages 
computer  crises for the Department of Energy at Lawrence  Liver-
more Laboratories.

"These  are  the organizations and the people who will  guide  us 
through  the coming adversities.  It is they who are  responsible 
to  insure that America never again finds itself  so  vulnerable.  
So  open  to attack.  So helpless in our  technological  Achilles 
Heel.  

"The  organizations I mentioned, and the government  itself  have 
not  yet been tested in a crisis of significant magnitude.   This 
is  their maiden voyage, so to speak, and it is incumbent on  us, 
the  American  people,  to make their job as easy as  we  can  by 
offering our complete cooperation.  

"And, tonight, that is what I am asking of you.  Your assistance.  
Your  government  cannot do it alone.  Nor  can  small  localized 
individual  efforts  expect to be successful against an  army  of 
invaders  so large.  We must team together, act as one,  for  the 
good  of the entire country.  From the big business with  100,000 
computers to the millions of men, women and children with a  home 
computer;  from the small businessman to the schools, we need  to 
come  together  against the common enemy:  the  invasion  of  our 
privacy and way of life. 

"Americans come together in a crisis, and my fellow Americans, we 
face  a crisis.  Let me tell you what my advisors tell me.   They 
tell me without taking immediate drastic steps to prevent further 
destruction  of America's information infrastructure, we  face  a 
depression as great as the one of the 1930's.   

"They tell me that every computer in the country, most in Canada, 
a  significant number in England and other countries, can  expect 
to be attacked in some manner within two years.  That  represents 
over 70 million casualties!

"The  international financial and monetary system will come to  a 
halt  and collapse.  Financial trading as we know it  will  cease 
and wild speculative fluctuations will dominate the world curren-
cy markets.  America is already feeling the change since the  ATM 
networks were removed from service. 

"As we have seen, the transportation facilities of this  country, 
and  indeed  the world, are totally dependent  on  computers  and 
therefore vulnerable.  That is why today we take so seriously the 
threats  against the airlines.  There is no choice  but  success.  
Together,  the American people must stand up to this  threat  and 
not succumb to its effects.

"While your government has the resources to develop solutions  to 
the  problems, it has not been within our power to mandate  their 
use in the private sector.

"We  will need unity as never before, for the battleground is  in 
our  homes,  our schools, our streets and  our  businesses.   The 
children  of this great country will have as much opportunity  to 
contribute as their parents will, and as the leaders of  business 
will.  As we all will and all must.

"In  conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the very structure of  our 
country  is in imminent danger of collapse, and it is up  to  us, 
indeed  it  is within our power, to survive.  The  sacrifices  we 
will be called upon to make may be great, but the alternative  is 
unacceptable. 

"Indeed, this is a time where the American spirit is called  upon 
to  shine,  and  shine brightly.  Thank you, and  God  Bless  the 
United States of America."

     Sunday, January 24
     Scarsdale, New York

"One  fuckuva speech," Tyrone Duncan said to Scott Mason who  was 
downing  the  last  of a Coors Light.  "You should  be  proud  of 
yourself."    They had watched the President's speech on  Scott's 
large screen TV. 

"Ahhhh," grunted Scott.  "It's almost anti-climatic."

"How  the hell can you say that?"  Tyrone objected.  "Isn't  this 
what you've been trying to do?  Get people to focus on the  prob-
lem?  Christ, you can't do much more than a Presidential speech."

"Oh,  yeah," agreed Scott cynically.  "Everyone knows, but not  a 
damn thing's gonna be done about it.  Nothing.  I don't care what 
the President says, nothing's going to change."  

"You  have become one cynical bastard.  Even Congress  is  behind 
the  President on this one.  His post-speech popularity  is  over 
70% according to CNN's Rapid Sample Poll."

"CNN.   Bah,  Humbug.  Sensationalist news.  And  you  think  the 
proposed computer crime bills will pass?" Scott asked doubtfully.

Tyrone hesitated.  "Sure, I think so.  And you don't?"

"No, I don't.  At least not in any meaningful way.  C'mon, you're 
the constitutionalist not me.  Sure, the original authors of  the 
bill will write something with punch, maybe even effective.   But 
by the time it gets committee'd to death, it'll be another  piece 
of  meaningless  watered  down piece of  shit  legislation.   And 
that's  before the states decide that computer crime is  a  state 
problem  and not an inter-state issue.  They'll say Uncle Sam  is 
treading  on  their turf and put up one  helluva  stink."   Scott 
shook his head discouragingly.  "I see nothing but headaches."

"I  think  you just feel left out, like your job's done  and  you 
have  nothing  to do anymore. Post partum depression."   Ty  rose 
from  the comfortable leather reading chair to get a couple  more 
beers.  "I kind of know how you feel."  

Scott looked up at Tyrone in bewilderment.  "You do?  How?"

"I'm definitely leaving.  We've made up my mind."  Tyrone  craned 
his neck from the kitchen.  "Arlene and I, that is."  Tyrone came 
back  and threw a silver bullet at Scott.  "This part of my  life 
is over and it's time I move on to something else."

"Computers and the Law I suppose?"  Scott said drearily.

"Don't  make  it sound like the plague,"  Tyrone  laughed.   "I'm 
doing  it  because I want to, and it's needed. In  fact  I  would 
expect  a  good amount of the work to be pioneering.   Pro  bono.  
There's  no  case  history; it'll be precedent  setting  law.   I 
figure  someone's  got  to be there to keep it  honest.  And  who 
better than  . . ." Tyrone spread his arms around the back of the 
chair.

"You,  I know.  The great byte hope."  Scott  laughed at his  own 
joke which triggered a similar response from Tyrone.  "Hey,  man.  
I wish you all the best, if that's what you really want."

A sudden beeping began.  "What's that?" asked Tyrone.

"A  computer  begging  for attention.  Let me  see  who  it  is."   
Tyrone  followed  Scott into his office,  still  astonished  that 
anyone  could work in such a pig pen.  And the rest of the  house 
was so neat.

     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>

The  computer  screen  held the image of the  single  word  while 
whoever was calling caused Scott's computer to beep incessantly.  

"What the hell?" Scott said out loud as he pecked at the keyboard 
standing rather than sitting at his desk.

wtfo

YOU'RE THERE.  GOOD.

kirk?

YUP.  WANNA GO TO A DEBATE?

Excuse me?

YOU WATCH THE PRESIDENT?

Of course.  I have a mild interest in the subject.

SO  DID I AND EVERY OTHER PHREAK IN THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE  NOT 
HAPPY.

Why?

SEE  FOR YOURSELF.  THE CONVERSATION PIT AT NEMO IS BRIMMING.   I 
GOT YOU AN INVITE.  

I have a guest.

FRIEND OR FOE

friend. definitely.

REMEMBER HOW TO USE MIRAGE?

I can fake it.

To Tyrone's amazement, Scott seemed to know what he was doing  at 
the  computer.  Scott sat down, put his  electronic  conversation 
with Kirk on hold, and called up another program as the  colorful 
screen split into two.  

I got you on the bottom window.

YOU'LL SEE THE PIT ON THE TOP.  JOIN IN WHEN YOU WANT.

Maybe I'll just listen.

WHATEVER.  I'M LOGGING ON.

The top window on Scott's computer screen blinked off momentarily 
and then was filled with a the words from the dissident phreaks.

CONVERSATION PIT: KIRK, RAMBO, PHASER, FON MAN, POLTERGEIST, 

AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?   <<FON MAN>>

B  THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT IS JUST TRYING TO TAKE OVER.  THE  BILL 
OF RIGHTS IS GOING RIGHT DOWN THE SHITTER  <<POLTERGEIST>>

I  AGREE.  THEY LOOK FOR ANY EXCUSE TO TAKE AWAY ANY  FREEDOM  WE 
MAY HAVE LEFT AND THEY TOOK THIS HOMOSOTO THING AND BLEW IT RIGHT 
OUT OF PROPORTION.  JUST LIKE VIETNAM.  <<PHASER>>

YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU? <<RAMBO>>

YOU BET YOUR SWEET ASS I DO.  SINCE WHEN HAS THE GOVERNMENT GIVEN 
A SHIT ABOUT US?  ONLY SINCE THEY REALIZED WE HAVE POWER  WITHOUT 
THEM.  THEY'RE NO LONGER IN CONTROL AND THEY'LL DO ANYTHING  THEY 
HAVE TO TO GET IT BACK.  <<POLTERGEIST>>

I DON'T THINK THAT IT'LL BE THAT BAD  <<KIRK>>

YOU BEEN HANGING OUT WITH THAT MASON GUY TOO MUCH <<PHASER>>

CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.  HE'S LISTENING  <<KIRK>>

ALL THE BETTER.  HE'S AS BAD AS THE FEDS. <<PHASER>>

May I say something? 

WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG? 

I must beg to differ with Phaser with a question.

IT'S YOUR DIME.  <<PHASER>>

Believe me, I understand that you guys have a point, about  hack-
ing and the free flow of information.  But who's in control  now?  
From my viewpoint, it's not you and it's not the government. It's 
Homosoto.

SO? <<PHASER>>

So, if freedom is the issue as you say, I assume that you want to 
keep your electronic freedom at all costs.  

RIGHT! <<PHASER>>

THAT'S THE POINT <<POLTERGEIST>>

Therefore, regardless of your opinions, you must realize that the 
government will do everything it thinks it needs to do to protect 
the country.

MAKE YOUR POINT. <<PHASER>>

It  seems to me that the best way for you to keep the  electronic 
freedom  you crave, might be to help fight Homosoto and  the  vi-
ruses  and  all.   Minimize the damage, help  defend  the  Global 
Network.

HE MAKES A POINT.  I'VE HELPED. <<KIRK>>

THEN  WE FALL INTO THEIR TRAP.  SAVE IT ALL AND THEN  THEY  CLOSE 
DOWN THE NETWORK.  I CAN'T PLAY INTO THEIR DECEIT AND  TREACHERY. 
<<POLTERGEIST>>

DO YOU THINK THE FREEDOM LEAGUE IS DOING GOOD? <<KIRK>>

OF COURSE NOT. <<PHASER>>

That's Homosoto.  Thousands of viruses.  NEMO already helped. 

ONLY THOSE THAT AGREE.  WE ARE NOT A DEMOCRACY.  <<POLTERGEIST>>

SO YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE VIRUSES? <<RAMBO>>

NOT YOU, TOO? <<PHASER>>

IT'S A MATTER OF RIGHT AND WRONG.  ELECTRONIC FREEDOM, ANARCHY IS 
ONE THING.  BUT WE DO NOT ABUSE.  WE LIVE BY THE CODE AND WANT TO 
KEEP THE NETWORK OPEN.  HOMOSOTO WANTS TO CLOSE THE NETWORK DOWN.  
BY SCARE TACTICS.  <<RAMBO>>

THAT  DOESN'T  CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE FASCIST  GOVERNMENT  WILL 
TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY. <<PHASER>>

Only  if  they have to.  Wouldn't you rather help and  keep  that 
from happening?

IF I TRUSTED THE GOVERNMENT. <<PHASER>>

Can I introduce you to someone?  His handle is FBI.

KIRK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GIVING US AWAY? <<POLTERGEIST>>

THEY'RE TIED IN ON MIRAGE.  THEY CAN PLAY BUT THERE'S NO  REDIAL.  
<<KIRK>>

Gentlemen, this is the FBI.  Let me tell you something.  I  don't 
agree with hacking, theft of service and the like.  But I also am 
pragmatic.  I recognize the difference between the lesser of  two 
evils.   And as of today, based upon what I know, you guys are  a 
pain the ass, but not a threat to national security.  That is why 
Washington has taken little interest in your activities.  But  at 
the same time, you are part of an underground that has access  to 
the electronic jungle in which we find ourselves.  We would  like 
your help.

OFFICIALLY? <<PHASER>>

No, unofficially.  I am law enforcement, associated with ECCO, if 
you've ever heard of them.

ECCO.   YOU GUYS FIGHT THE REAL COMPUTER JERKS, DON'T YOU?   LIKE 
ROBERT MORRIS AND PUNJAB.  DID YOU EVER CATCH THE GUY WHO STOPPED 
THE SHUTTLE FLIGHT?  <<POLTERGEIST>>

Sadly,  no.  I am talking to you as a friend of Scott's.   And  I 
will tell you, that anything I learn I will use to fight  Homoso-
to's attack.  But frankly, you are little fish.  I don't know who 
you  are,  nor do I really care.  In all  honesty,  neither  does 
Washington, the NSA or anyone else.  You're merely an underground 
protest  group.  If anything, you help keep us honest.  But  even 
protestors should have their limits.

MINE HAS BEEN REACHED.  <<KIRK>>

AND MINE.  <<RAMBO>>

There is a big difference between freedom of speech and insurrec-
tion and invasion.  

WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY?  <<PHASER>>

THERE IS NONE, AND YOU KNOW IT. <<KIRK>> 

THAT'S  THE POINT.  WE HAVE TO STOP THE MILITARISTIC WAR  MONGERS 
FROM  PRYING INTO OUR LIVES.  THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US,  AND 
MORE.  I WANT TO SEE THAT STOPPED.  NOW.  <<PHASER>>

This  is  Mason.   At the expense of  true  freedom?  Freedom  of 
choice?   By your logic, you may end up with no  Compuserve.   No 
electronic mail boxes. No networks.  Or, they'll be so restricted 
that you'll never get on them. 

IT'LL HAPPEN ANYWAY. <<PHASER>>

And  you'll just speed up the process.  What do you have to  lose 
by helping out?

I WANT TO CONTINUE HELPING.  MY FREEDOM TO HACK RESPONSIBLY IS IN 
DANGER BY ONE MAN, AND I AIM ON KEEPING MY FREEDOM. <<KIRK>>

It  may  be the only way to keep the digital highways  open,  I'm 
sorry to say.

IS THAT A THREAT?  <<PHASER>>

Merely an observation.  

I NEED TO THINK. <<PHASER>>

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? <<RAMBO>>

A lot.  We need a complete list of phone numbers for every  Free-
dom BBS.  They provide wide distribution of infected software.

WE KNOW. BFD. <<PHASER>>

This is FBI.  We want to shut them down.  

HOW? <<KIRK>>

We have our means.

SEE WHAT I MEAN!  THEY'RE ALL PIGS.  THEY TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.   BUT 
IF YOU ASK SOMETHING THEY CLAM UP. <<PHASER>>

All  right.   If it works you'll find out anyway.   There  are  a 
number  of underused laws, and we want to keep this on a  Federal 
level.  USC 1029, 1030, 2134 - they're a bunch of them  including 
racketeering.   Then there are  a number of Federal laws  against 
doing anything injurious to the United States.

WHICH  GIVES  YOU  THE RIGHT TO PROSECUTE ANYONE  YOU  DAMN  WELL 
PLEASE WHENEVER YOU DAMN WELL WANT. <<POLTERGEIST>>

As a lawyer, I could make that case.

I AM A LAWYER, TOO.  I PHREAK FOR PHREEDOM. <<POLTERGEIST>>

Then you also know, that you have to really be on someone's  shit 
list to get the FBI after you.  Right now, Homosoto and his  gang 
are on our shit list big time.

THEN  WHEN  YOU'RE THROUGH WITH THEM, IT'S US NEXT.   THEN  WHO'S 
LEFT? <<PHASER>>

RIGHT. <<POLTERGEIST>>

We  can argue forever.  All I'm saying is we could  use  whatever 
help  you  can give us.  And I honestly don't care who  you  are.  
Unless of course you're on my shit list.

FBI HUMOR.  <<KIRK>>

WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?  <<RAMBO>>

As  many signatures as possible.  We figure that there are  thou-
sands of you out there, and you can probably do a better job than 
any  government  security group punching in at nine  and  out  at 
five.   You have more people, no bureaucracy and a bigger  sample 
of the software population.

SIGNATURES?  NO QUESTIONS ASKED?  <<PHASER>>

None.  Also, rumors.  

WHAT KIND OF RUMORS?  <<KIRK>> 

Like who might want to disrupt the Air Reservations System.

YOU'RE KIDDING?  <<POLTERGEIST>>

I wish I was.  You see, we are up against the wall.  

THAT COULD REALLY FUCK THINGS UP.  <<POLTERGEIST>>

REALLY! <<KIRK>>

IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?    <<POLTERGEIST>>

Worse.

MAYBE I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. <<POLTERGEIST>>

ME TOO. <<PHASER>>

MASON.  I'M GOING TO CUT YOU OFF. <<KIRK>>

It won't be the first time. 

     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>

Tyrone  stretched  his limbs searching for a bare  place  to  sit 
down.  Leaning over Scott's shoulders for the slow paced computer 
conversation  stiffened  his muscles.  Scott  motioned  to  slide 
whatever  was  in the way, out of the way, to which  Tyrone  com-
plied.

"Dedicated  mother fuckers.  Misguided, but dedicated."   Ty  sat 
back in thought.  "What do you think they'll do?"

"I  don't think, I know," said Scott confidently.  "Most of  them 
will  help, but they won't admit it.  They openly  distrust  you, 
Washington  and me.  But they value their freedom,  and  instinc-
tively they will protect that.  Kirk will be the conduit. I'm not 
worried."

"And what will they do?"

"Once  they get around to it, they'll commandeer every hacker  in 
the  country and at least stop the viruses.  Or some of them.   I 
think  that we need to elicit their trust, and I can do  that  by 
giving them more than they give me."

"Can you do that?"

"Just  watch.   If  they  play their cards  right,  they  can  be 
heroes."

                              Chapter 29
     Monday, January 25
     The White House

We  had a pretty good handle on parts of it," said Marvin  Jacobs 
glibly.

Phil  Musgrave, Martin Royce, Henry Kennedy and Quinton  Chambers 
joined Marvin in one of the private White House conference  rooms 
at  5  A.M.  Jacobs had called all members of the  inner  circle, 
personally, early that morning.   He had received word that  last 
evening's  computer  conversations between Scott  Mason  and  the 
Spook  had  been  intercepted and the  preliminary  analysis  was 
ready.

Scott Mason's computer screens had been read by the NSA's  remote 
electromagnetic  receivers while he prepared his article for  the 
following  day.  The actual article had also been transmitted  to 
the White House, prior to publication, as agreed.

"And  Mason  seems to be living up to his part of  the  bargain," 
Jacobs  continued.   "He only edits out the bullshit,  pardon  my 
French.  Gives the public their money's worth."

"You  said  we were close.  How close?"  Musgrave tended  to  run 
these meetings; it was one of the perks of being the  President's 
Number One.

"His organization was a lot more comprehensive than we  thought," 
Henry Kennedy said.  "We underestimated his capabilities, but  we 
caught the essence of his weapons by good guessing."

"If  we  could  get our hands on this  Spook  character,"  sighed 
Martin Royce.  He was thinking of the perennial problems  associ-
ated  with identifying the exact location of someone who  doesn't 
want to be found.  

"That's not the problem," said Chief of Staff Phil Musgrave.  "We 
know who the Spook is, but we can't prove it.  It's only hearsay, 
even  with Mason's testimony, and it's a pretty damn safe bet  he 
won't  be  inclined to testify.  But Marv has given us a  ton  on 
him.  After all, he is Marv's fault."

"You  guys  sort that out on your own time," yawned  Phil.   "For 
now, though we need to know what we're up against."

"If the President hadn't gone on television last night, we  might 
have been able to keep this quiet and give the press some answers 
in a few days."  Marv said.

"Dream  on," Phil said emphatically.  "Mason broke the story  and 
we were caught with our pants down.  The President did not, and I 
repeat, did not, want to be associated with any cover up . . ."

"I didn't say cover up . . ."

"He  wants to take his lumps and fix it.  He will not lie to  the 
American people."

"If we shut Mason up."  Marv suggested.

"We  need him right where he is," Henry Kennedy said about  Scott 
to stem the escalating argument.  

"The  subject  is  closed."  Phil's comment  silenced  the  room.  
After all was said and done, Musgrave was the closet thing to the 
President in the room.  As with the President, the discussion was 
over, the policy set, now let's get on with it.  "So, Marv?  What 
are we up against."

The seasoned professional in Marvin Jacobs took over, conflicting 
opinions  in the past, and he handed out a series of  TOP  SECRET 
briefing folders.

"You've  got to be kidding," laughed Martin Royce holding up  his 
file.   "This  stuff  will be in today's morning  paper  and  you 
classify it?"

"There are guidelines for classification," Marvin insisted.   "We 
follow them to the letter."  

"And  every  letter gets classified." muttered  Royce  under  his 
breath.  The pragmatist in him saw the lunacy of the  classifica-
tion process, but the civil servant in him recognized the  impos-
sibility of changing it.  Marv ignored the comment and opened his 
folder.

"Thanks,  Phil," began Marv.  "Well, I'll give it to him,  Foster 
that  is.  If what he says is accurate, we have our work cut  out 
for  us, and in many cases all we can do is board up our  windows 
before the hurricane hits."  

"For  purposes of this discussion, assume, as we will,  that  the 
Spook,  Foster, is telling the truth.  Do we have any  reason  to 
disbelieve him?"

"Other  than attacking his own country?  No, no reason  at  all."  
Marvin  showed total disdain for Foster.  His  vehemence  quieted 
the room, so he picked up where he left off.

"The  first thing he did was establish a communications  network, 
courtesy  of AT&T.  If Foster is right, then his boys  have  more 
doors and windows in and out of the phone company computers  than 
AT&T  knows  exist.  For all intents and purposes,  they  can  do 
anything with the phone system that they want.

"They  assign their own numbers, tap into digital  transmissions, 
reprogram  the  main switches, create  drop-dead  billings,  keep 
unlimited  access lines and Operator Control. If we do  locate  a 
conversation,  they're  using  a  very  sophisticated  encryption 
scheme to disguise their communications.  They're using the  same 
bag  of  tricks we tried to classify over 20 years  ago,  and  if 
anyone had listened . . ."

"We  get the point, Marv," Phil said just before Henry was  about 
to say the same thing.

"We  can triangulate the cell phone location, but it takes  time.  
Perhaps the smartest thing Foster did was recognize the need  for 
an efficient distribution system.  In order for his plan to work, 
he  had  to  insure  that  every  computer  in  the  country  was 
infected."

"Thus  the dGraph situation?"  Quinton Chambers finally began  to 
look awake.

"And  the Lotus Viruses, and the Freedom software,"  Henry  said.  
"What about FTS-2000?"  He was asking about the new multi-billion 
dollar  voice  and data communications network.  FTS  stands  for 
Federal Telecommunications System.

"I  have  no doubt that it's in the same boat,"  suggested  Marv.  
"But  we have no sure data yet.  We should ask Scott to ask  Fos-
ter."

"What could happen?"

"Worst case?  The government shuts down for lack of interest  and 
no dial tone."

"And these viruses?"

"According  to  Foster, they designed over 8,000 viruses  and  he 
assumes that all or most of them have been released over the last 
several years," Marv said to a room full of raised eyebrows.

"How bad is that?"  asked Chambers.

"Let's  put it this way," said Marv.  "In the last 14  years,  of 
the  viruses  that  have been confirmed,  the  longest  gestation 
period,  from release to detonation . . .was eight  months.   And 
that  one  was discovered a couple of weeks after they  were  re-
leased.   What  Foster counted on was the fact that  if  software 
behaved  normally,  it  wouldn't be suspect.  And  if  it  became 
popular, it was automatically above suspicion.  He was right."

"I've heard that every computer is infected?"

"At  the minimum, yes."  Jacobs turned the pages of his  dossier.  
"To  continue, one of Foster's most important tools was the  con-
struction of road maps."

"Road maps?" questioned Phil.

"Connections,  how  it  all ties together.  How  MILNET  ties  to 
INTERNET  to DARPANET to DockMaster, then to  the  Universities."  
Marv wove a complex picture of how millions of computers are  all 
interconnected.  "Foster knew what he was doing.  He called  this 
group  Mappers. The maps included the private  nets,  CompuServe, 
The Source, Gemini, Prodigy . . .BBS's to Tymenet . . .the  lists 
go  on  forever.  The road maps, according to Foster,  were  very 
detailed.  The kind of computer, the operating system, what  kind 
of  security  if any.  They apparently raked through  the  hacker 
bulletin  boards  and  complied massive lists  of  passwords  for 
computers . . ."

"Including ours?"  asked Quinton Chambers.

"Quite  definitely.  They kept files on the back doors, the  trap 
doors  and the system holes so they could enter  computers  unde-
tected,  or  infect the files or erase them . . .take a  look  at 
Social Security and the IRS.  Martin?"

Treasury Secretary Royce nodded in strong agreement.  "We got hit 
but  good.  We still have no idea how many hundreds of  thousands 
of tax records are gone forever, if they were ever there.  So far 
it's  been kept under wraps, but I don't know how long  that  can 
continue.  The CDN has been nothing but trouble.  We're  actually 
worse off with it than without it."

"How  can one person do all of that?" Chambers had little  knowl-
edge of computers, but he was getting a pretty good feel for  the 
potential political fallout.

"One  person!  Ha!"  exclaimed Jacobs.  "Look at  Page  16."   He 
pointed  at  his  copy of the Secret  documents.   "According  to 
Foster  he told Homosoto he needed hundreds of full time  mappers 
to draw an accurate and worthwhile picture of the  communications 
and networks in the U.S.."

"That's a lot of money right there," added Royce.

"It's  obvious that money wasn't a consideration."  Phil  spouted 
the  current political party line as well as it  was  understood. 
"Retaliation against the United States was the motivation, and to 
hell with the cost."

"Homosoto  obviously took Foster's advice when it came to  Propa-
ganda," Marv continued.  "The FBI, I believe, saw the results  of 
a  concentrated effort at creating distrust in computers.   We've 
got  a  team  working on just finding  the  blackmailers.   Their 
version of a disinformation campaign was to spread the truth, the 
secret  undeniable  truths of those who most want to  keep  their 
secrets a secret."

"That's  also  where the banks got hit so  hard,"  offered  Henry 
Kennedy.  "Tens of thousands of credit card numbers were spirited 
away  from bank computers everywhere. You can imagine  the  shock 
when  tens of millions of dollars of purchases were contested  by 
the legitimate credit card holders."

"It's bad," agreed Royce.

"And  we haven't even seen the beginning yet, if we believe  Fos-
ter. There were other groups.  Some specialized in  Tempest-Bust-
ing . . ."

"Excuse me?" asked Quinton Chambers.

"Reading the signals broadcast by computers," Marv said with some 
derision.  The Secretary of State should know better, he thought. 
"It's  a classified Defense program."  He paused  while  Chambers 
made  a note.  "Others used stolen EMP-T bomb technology to  blow 
up  the  Stock  Exchange  and they even  had  antennas  to  focus 
HERF . . ."

"HERF?" laughed Phil.

"HERF,"  said  Marv defensively.  "High Energy  Radiated  Fields.  
Pick  a frequency, add an antenna, point and shoot.   Poof!  Your 
computer's history."

"You're kidding me . . ."

"No joke.  We and the Soviets did it for years; Cold War  Games," 
said  Kennedy.   "Pretty  hush-hush stuff.   We  have  hand  held  
electric guns that will stop a car cold at a thousand yards."

"Phasers?" asked Chambers.

"Sort of, Quinton," chimed in Phil.

"Foster's plan also called for moles to be placed within  strate-
gic  organizations,  civilian and government."   Marv  continued.  
"They  were to design and release malicious software from  inside 
the  company.  Powerful technique if you can find  enough  bodies 
for the dirty work."

"Again, according to Foster, Homosoto said that there was never a 
manpower problem," Marv said.  "He's confident that an Arab group 
is  involved somewhere.  The MacDonald's accident was  caused  by 
Arabs who . . ."

"And  we still can't get shit out of the one who  we're  holding.  
The   only   one  that's  left.   Troubleaux  was  shot   by   an 
Arab  . . .the FBI is working hard on that angle.  They've  given 
themselves extraordinary covers." Phil was always on top of those 
things  that  might have a political cause and/or  effect.   "How 
extensive an operation was this?"

Marvin Jacobs ruffled through some notes in his files. "It's hard 
to  be sure.  If Homosoto followed all of Foster's plan, I  would 
guess  3 - 5,000 people, with a cost of between $100 - $300  Mil-
lion.  But mind you, that's an uneducated guesstimate."

Quinton Chambers dropped his pen on the table.  "Are you  telling 
us  that one man is bringing the United States virtually  to  its 
knees for a couple of hundred million?"  Marv reluctantly nodded.  
"Gentlemen,  this is incredible, more than incredible .  .  .does 
the President know?"

Even  Phil Musgrave was antsy with the answer to  that  question.  
"Not  in any detail, but he is very concerned.  As for the  cost, 
terrorism has never been considered expensive."

"Well  thank  you Ron Ziegler, for that  piece  of  information," 
scowled Chambers.  "So if we know all of this, why don't we  pick 
'em all up and get this over with and everything working again?"

"Foster claims he doesn't know who anyone other than Homosoto is.  
He was kept in the dark.  That is certainly not inconsistent with 
the  way Homosoto is known to do business -  very  compartmental-
ized.  He didn't do the recruitment, he said, and all  communica-
tions were done over the computer . . .no faces, no names. If  it 
wasn't for Mason, we wouldn't even know that Foster is the Spook. 
I consider us very lucky on that point alone."

"What  are  we going to do? What can we do?" Royce  and  Chambers 
both  sounded  and looked more concerned than the  others.  Their 
agencies  were  on  the front line and the most  visible  to  the 
public.

"For the government we can take some mandatory precautions.   For 
the private sector, probably nothing . . ."

"Unless."  Phil said quietly.

"Unless what?"  All heads turned to Phil Musgrave.

"Unless the President invokes martial law to protect the  country 
and  takes control of the computers until we can respond."   Phil 
often thought out loud, even with his extremist possibilities.

"Good idea!" said Jacobs quickly.

"You think that public will buy that?" asked Chambers.

"No, but they may have no choice."

     PRESIDENT DECLARES WAR ON COMPUTERS 
     By Scott Mason

Support  for the President's Sunday night call to arms  has  been 
virtually unanimous by industry leaders.

According to James Worthington, Director of Computing Services at 
First  National Life, "We take the threat to our  computers  very 
seriously.   Without the reliable operation of our  MIS  systems, 
our  customers  cannot be serviced and the  company  will  suffer 
tremendous losses.  Rates will undoubtedly rise unless we protect 
ourselves."

Similar  sentiments  were echoed by most industry  leaders.   IBM 
announced  it  would be closing all of its computer  centers  for 
between two and four weeks to effect a complete cleansing of  all 
systems  and  products.   A spokesperson for IBM  said,  "If  our 
computers  are  threatened, we will take all necessary  steps  to 
protect our investment and the confidence of our customers.   IBM 
prefers a short term disruption in normal services to a long term 
failure."   

Well  placed persons within the government concur that  the  NSA, 
who  is responsible for guiding the country through  the  current 
computer  crisis, is ideally suited for managing  the  situation.  
Even  agencies who have in the past been critical of  the  super-
secret NSA are praising their preliminary efforts and recommenda-
tions to deal with the emergency.

In  a several page document issued by the NSA, a series of  safe-
guards  is  outlined  to protect computers against  many  of  the 
threats they now face.   In addition, the NSA has asked all  long 
distance carriers to, effective immediately, deny service to  any 
digital communications until further notice.  Despite high  marks 
for  the NSA in other areas, many of their defensive  recommenda-
tions have not been so well received.  

"We  are actually receiving more help from the public  BBS's  and 
local  hacker groups in finding and eradicating the viruses  than 
from the NSA or ECCO," said the Arnold Fullerman, Vice  President 
of Computer Services at Prudential.  

AT&T  is also critical of the government's efforts.  "The  Presi-
dential  Order gives the NSA virtual control over the use of  our 
long distance services.  Without the ability to transmit  digital 
data  packets,  we can expect a severely negative impact  on  our 
first  quarter earnings . . ."  While neither AT&T nor the  other 
long  distance carriers indicated they would defy  the  executive 
decree, they did say that their attorneys were investigating  the 
legality of the mandate. 

The NSA, though, was quick to respond to criticism. "All the  NSA 
and its policies are trying to achieve is a massive reduction  in 
the  rate of propagation of the Homosoto Viruses, eliminate  fur-
ther infection, so we can isolate and immunize as many  computers 
as  possible.  This will be a short term situation  only."    De-
tractors vocally dispute that argument.

AT&T, Northern TelCom and most telephone manufacturers are taking 
additional  steps  in protecting one of Homosoto's  key  targets: 
Public  and Private Branch Exchanges, PBX's, or  phone  switches.  
They  have all developed additional security recommendations  for 
customers  to  keep  Phone Phreaks from  utilizing  the  circuits 
without authorization.  Telephone fraud alone reached an estimat-
ed $14 Billion last year, with the courts upholding that  custom-
ers  whose  phones were misused are still liable for  all  bills.  
Large companies have  responded by not paying the bills and  with 
lawsuits.

The  NSA is further recommending federal legislation to  mitigate 
the  effects of future computer attacks.  They propose that  com-
puter security be required by law. 

"We  feel that it would be prudent to ask the private  sector  to 
comply  with  minimum security levels. The C2 level  is  easy  to 
reach, and will deter all but the most dedicated assaults.  It is 
our  belief that as all cars are manufactured with  safety  items 
such  as  seat belts, all computer should  be  manufactured  with 
security and information integrity mechanisms in place. C2  level 
will meet 99% of the public's needs."  A spokesman for ECCO,  one 
of  the  emergency computer organizations working  with  the  NSA 
explained  that  such security levels available  outside  of  the 
highest  government levels range from D Level, the weakest, to  A 
Level, the strongest.  

It  is estimated that compliance with such  recommendations  will 
add no more than $50 to the cost of each computer.

The  types  of organizations that the NSA  recommend  secure  its 
computers  by  law is extensive, and is meeting with  some  vocal 
opposition:

Companies  with more than 6 computers connected in a  network  or 
that use remote communications.

Companies which store information about other people or organiza-
tions. 

All Credit Card merchants.

Companies that do business with local, state or federal agencies.

The entire Federal Government, regardless of data classification.

All  publicly funded organizations including  schools,  universi-
ties, museums, libraries, research, trade bureaus etc.

Public Access Data Bases and Bulletin Boards.

"It  is crazy to believe that 45 million computers  could  comply 
with  a  law like that in under 2 years," said Harry  Everett,  a 
Washington  D.C.  based security consultant.  "In  1987  Congress 
passed a law saying that the government had to protect 'sensitive 
but unclassified data' to a minimum C2 level by 1992.  Look where 
we  are now!  Not even close, and now they expect to  secure  100 
times that many in one tenth the time?  No way."

Another critic said, "C2?  What a joke.  Europe is going by ITSEC 
and  they  laugh  at the Orange Book.  If you're  going  to  make 
security a law, at least do it right."

NSA  also had words for those computers which do not  fall  under 
the  umbrella of the proposed legislation.  Everyone is  strongly 
urged to practice safe computing.

"I'm sorry sir, we can't  find you in the computer," the  harried 
young woman said from behind the counter. 

"Here's  my boarding pass," he said shoving the  small  cardboard 
pass into her face.  "And here's a paid for ticket. I want to get 
on my flight."

"Sir,  there seems to be a complication," she nervously  said  as 
she  saw at least another hundred angry people behind  the  irate 
customer.

"What kind of complication?" he demanded.

"It seems that you're not the only one with a ticket for Seat 11- 
D on this flight."

"What's that supposed to mean?"  

"Sir, it seems that the flight has been accidentally  overbooked, 
by about 300 people."

"Well, I have a ticket and a boarding pass . . ."

"So do they, sir."

Delta and American and Northwest and USAir were all  experiencing 
problems  at  every gate their airlines serviced.  So  was  every 
other   airline  that used the National  Reservation  Service  or 
Saber.  Some flights though, were not so busy.

"What  kind of load we have tonight, Sally?" asked Captain  David 
Clark.   The  American red-eye from LAX to Kennedy  was  often  a 
party flight, with music and entertainment people swapping cities 
and visiting ex-wives and children on the opposite coast.  

"Light," she replied over the galley intercom from the middle  of 
the 400 seat DC-10.  

"How light?"

"Crew of eleven.  Two passengers."

By  midnight, the entire air traffic system was in  total  chaos.  
Empty  airplanes sat idly in major hubs awaiting passengers  that 
never came.  Pilots and flight crews waiting for instructions  as 
take-offs  from  airports  all but ceased.   Overbooking  was  so 
rampant  that police were called into dozens of airports  to  re-
store  order.  Fist fights broke out and despite pleas  for  calm 
from  the  police  and the airlines, over 200  were  arrested  on 
charges  of  disorderly conduct, assault  and  resisting  arrest.  
Tens  of  thousands  of passengers  had  confirming  tickets  for 
flights that didn't exist or had left hours before.

Arriving passengers at the international airports, LAX,  Kennedy, 
San Francisco, Miami were stranded with no flights, no hotels and 
luggage often destined for parts unknown.  Welcome to the  United 
States.

The FAA had no choice but to shut down the entire air transporta-
tion system at 2:22 A.M.

"Tell me how it works."

"We  have lines installed from the 114 Signal Transfer Points  in 
every phone district to a pair of Cray-YMP's at the Fort.   Every 
single AT&T long distance phone call goes through these  switches 
and is labeled by an IAM with where the call came from and  where 
it's  going.   What we're looking for is the high  usage  digital 
lines.   Including  fax  lines.   So the phone  company  is  kind 
enough  to  send  us a list of every call.  We  get  about  seven 
million an hour."

"We can handle that?"

"We have enough to handle ten times that."

"I forget about the international monitors.  That's millions more 
calls a day we listen to."

"Yessir.  The computers go through every call and make a list  of 
digital  calls.   Then we get a list of all billing  records  and 
start  crunching.  We compare the high usage digital  lines  with 
the phone numbers from the bills and look for patterns.  We  look 
to see if it's a private or business line, part of a private PBX, 
hours  and days of usage, then who owns the line.   Obviously  we 
eliminate a great many from legitimate businesses.  After  inten-
sive  analysis  and profile comparison, we got a a  few  thousand 
candidates.  What we decided to look for was two things. 

"First, we listen to the lines to make sure it's a computer.   If 
it is, we get a look at the transmissions.  If they are  encrypt-
ed, they get a red flag and onto the Hit List."

"The President bought this?" 

"We  told  him we'd only need the records for a short  time,  and 
then we would dispose of them.  He agreed."

"What a sucker.  Good work."

     Computer License Law Possible?
     by Scott Mason

Senator Mark Bowman's proposed legislation is causing one of  the 
most stirring debates on Capital Hill since the divisive decision 
to free Kuwait militarily.

The  so-called  "Computer License Law" is expected to  create  as 
much division in the streets and homes of America as it is polit-
ically.

The bill calls for every computer in the country to be registered 
with  the Data Registration Agency, a working component  of   the 
Commerce  Dept.   The  proposed 'nominal fees'  are  intended  to 
insure  that the technology to protect computer systems keeps  up 
with other computer technology. 

Critics,  though,  are extremely vocal in their opposition  to  a 
bill that they say sends a strong message to the American people:  
We  don't trust you.  The FYI, Freeflow of Your Information  says 
that  passage of the Computer License Law will give  the  federal 
government  the  unrestricted  ability and right  to  invade  our 
privacy.  Dr. Sean Kirschner, the chief ACLU counsel, is  consid-
ering  a  lawsuit against the United States if the  bill  passes.  
Kirschner  maintains  that "  . . .if the License Law  goes  into 
effect,  the streets will be full of Computers Cops  handing  out 
tickets if your computer doesn't have a license.  The enforcement 
clauses  of  the bill essentially give the police  the  right  to 
listen  to your computer.  That is a simple invasion of  privacy, 
and  we will not permit a precedent to be set.  We lost too  much 
freedom under Reagan."

Proponents of the bill insist that the low fee, perhaps only  $10 
per year per computer, is intended to finance efforts at  keeping 
security  technology  apace with computer technology.   "We  have 
learned  our lesson the hard way, and we now need to address  the 
problem head on before it bites us again."  They cite the example 
of England, where televisions have been licensed for years,  with 
the fees dedicated to supporting the arts and maintaining  broad-
casting facilities.

"Does not apply," says Dr. Kirschner.  "With a television,  there 
isn't  an  issue of privacy.  A computer is  like  an  electronic 
diary, and that privacy must be respected at all costs."  

"And,"  he adds, "that's England, not the U.S..  They don't  have 
freedom of the press, either."

Kirschner  vowed a highly visible fight if Congress " . .  .dares 
to pass that vulgar law . . ."

"At this hour?" Scott said sleepily.

"You want or no?"  Tyrone Duncan answered with irritation.

"Yeah, yeah, I want," Scott grumbled.  "What time is it?"

"Four A.M. Why?"

"I won't make the morning . . ."

"I'm giving you six hours lead.  Quit bitching."

"O.K., O.K., what is it?"

"It  looks like your NEMO friends were right.  There are  bunches

     TOWN DISAPPEARS
     By Scott Mason

The town of Fallsworth, Idaho is facing a unique problem.  It  is 
out of business.

Fallsworth,  Idaho, population 433, has a computer population  of 
611. 

But  no  one in the entire incorporation of Fallsworth  has  ever 
bought or paid for a single piece of software or hardware.

Three  years ago, the town counsel approved a plan to  make  this 
small potato farming community the most computerized township  in 
the United States, and it seems that they succeeded.   Apparently 
the  city hall of Fallsworth was contacted by representatives  of 
Apple Computer.  Would they like to be part of an experiment?

Apple Computer provided every home and business in the Fallsworth 
area  with a computer and the necessary equipment to tie  all  of 
the computers together into one town-wide  network.  The city was 
a  pilot  program  for the Electronic City of  the  future.   The 
residents  of  Fallsworth were trained to use the  computers  and 
Apple and associated companies provided the township beta  copies 
of software to try out, play with and comment on.  

Fallsworth, Idaho was truly the networked city.

Lily  Williams and members of the other 172 households in  Falls-
worth  typed out their grocery lists on their computer,  matching 
them  to  known inventories and pricing  from  Malcolm  Druckers' 
General Store.  When the orders arrived at the Drucker  computer, 
the goods just had to be loaded in the pick up truck.   Druckers' 
business increased 124% after the network was installed.

Doctors  Stephenson, Viola and Freemont, the three  town  doctors 
modem'ed prescriptions to Baker Pharmacy so the pills were  ready 
by the time their patients arrived.  

Mack's  Messengers  had cellular modems  and  portable  computers 
installed in their delivery trucks.  They were so efficient, they 
expanded their business into nearby Darbywell, Idaho, population, 
5,010.

Today,  Fallsworth,  Idaho doesn't use its computers.   They  lie 
dormant.  A town without life.   They forgot how to live and work 
and  play  and  function without their  computers.  Who  are  the 
slaves?

The  viruses of Lotus, of dGraph. The viruses of Freedom  struck, 
and no one in the entire town had registration cards.  The  soft-
ware  crisis has left Fallsworth and a hundred other  small  test 
sites for big software firms out in the digital void.  

Apple  Computer  promised to look into the matter but  said  that 
customers who have paid for their products come first . . .

     FBI Building, Federal Square

Tyrone  Duncan  was as busy as he had ever  been,  attempting  to 
coordinate the FBI's efforts in tracking down any of the increas-
ing number of computer criminals. And there were a lot of them at 
the moment.  The first Copy-Cat computer assaults were coming  to 
light,  making  it all that much more difficult  to  isolate  the 
Foster  Plan  activities from those other  non-coordinated  inci-
dents.

Tyrone,  as did his counterparts in regional FBI offices  nation-
wide, created teams of agents who concentrated on specific  areas 
of  Homosoto's assault as described by the Spook.  Some  special-
ized  in tracing missing electronic funds, some in  working  with 
the phone company through the NSA.  More than any other goal, the 
FBI wanted desperately to locate as many of the invisible  agents 
that  the Spook, Miles Foster, had told Homosoto to use.   Tyrone 
doubted  they would catch anywhere near the 3000 or more  he  was 
told  that  were  out there, but at this point  any  success  was 
welcome.

FBI  agents  toiled and interviewed and  researched  sixteen  and 
eighteen hours a day, seven days a week.  There hadn't been  such 
a  blanket approval of overtime since the Kennedy  assassination.  
The  FBI followed up the leads generated by the computers at  the 
NSA.   Who and where were the likely associates of  Homosoto  and 
Foster?

His  phone rang - the private line that bypasses  his  secretary- 
startling Tyrone from the deep thought in which he was  immersed.  
On  a Saturday.  As the voice on the other end of the  phone  ut-
tered  its  first  sound, Tyrone knew that it  was  Bob  Burnson. 
Apparently he was in his office today as well.

"Afternoon, Bob," Tyrone said vacantly.

"Gotcha at a bad time?"  Burnson asked.

"No, no.  Just going over something that may prove interesting."

"Go ahead, make my day," joked Burnson.

"I know you don't want to know . . ."

"Then don't tell me . . ."

"But Mason's hackers are coming through for us."

"Jeez, Ty," whined Bob.  "Do you have to . . ."

"Do  you  know anybody else that is capable of moving  freely  in 
those  circles?   It's not exactly  our  specialty,"  reprimanded 
Tyrone.

"In theory it's great," Bob reluctantly agreed, "but there are so 
damn  many exposures.  They can mislead us, they're  not  profes-
sionals,  and worst of all, we don't even know who they  are,  to 
perform a background check."

"Bob,  you  go over to the other side . . . playing desk  man  on 
me?"

"Ty, I told you a while ago, I could only hang so far out  before 
the branches started shaking."

"Then  you  don't know anything."  Tyrone  said  in  negotiation.  
Keep  Bob officially uninformed and unofficially  informed.  "You 
don't  know that NEMO has helped to identify four of  the  black-
mailers and a handful of the Freedom Freaks.  You don't know that 
we  have gotten more reliable information from Mason's kids  than 
from ECCO, CERT, NIST and NSA combined.  They're up in the clouds 
with  theory  and conjecture and  what-iffing  themselves  silly.  
NEMO is in the streets.  A remote control informer if you like."

"What else don't I know?"

"You  don't know that NEMO has been giving us security  holes  in 
some  of  our  systems.  You don't know that  Mason's  and  other 
hackers have been working on the Freedom viruses."

"Some systems?  Why not all?"

"They still want to keep a few trapdoors for themselves."

"See what I mean!" exclaimed Burnson.  "They can't be trusted."

"They  are  not on our payroll.  Besides, it's them or  no  one," 
Tyrone calmly said.  "They really would like to keep the real-bad 
guys off of the playing field, as they put it."

"And keep the spoils for their own use."

"It's a trade-off I thought was worthwhile."

"I  don't  happen  to  agree, and  neither  does  the  Director's 
office."

"I thought you didn't know . . ."

"Word  gets around.  We have to cap this one, Ty.  It's too  hot.  
This is so far from policy I think we could be shot."

"You know nothing.  Nothing."

But Burnson and the FBI and the White House all knew they  wanted 
Foster.   Tyrone  instinctively  knew as did  Scott,  that  Miles 
Foster was the Spook.  Other than meager unsubstantiated  circum-
stantial  evidence, though, there was still no  convincing  legal 
connection  between  Miles Foster and the Spook.  Not  enough  of 
one, anyway. 

Miles Foster had done an extraordinary job of insulating  himself 
and his identity from his army.  

There had to be another way.

     Lawsuit Cites Virus
     by Scott Mason

Will stockholders of corporations soon require that all Corporate 
assets be appropriately protected?  Including those contained  in 
the  computers?  Many people see a strong possibility of a  swell 
of  Wall Street investor demands to secure the computers of  pub-
licly  held companies.  The SEC is planning on issuing a  set  of 
preliminary regulations for firms under its aegis.

Last week, a group of 10,000 Alytech, Inc. stockholders filed the 
first  class  action suit along this vein.  They  are  suing  the 
current  board  of directors for " . .  .willful  dereliction  of 
fiduciary responsibility in the adequate security and  protection 
of corporate information, data, communications and data  process-
ing  and  communications equipment."  The suit continues  to  say 
that  the company, under the Directors' leadership  and  guidance 
knew and understood the threat to their computers, yet did  noth-
ing to correct the situation.

Attorneys  for the plaintiffs have said that they are in  posses-
sion  of a number of internal Alytech documents and  memos  which 
spelled out security recommendations to their board of  directors 
upon which no action was taken.

Alytech  was one of the many companies hit particularly  hard  by 
the  Computer War.  The dGraph virus, the Lotus viruses  and  the 
Novell viruses were among those that infected over 34,000 of  the 
company's computers around the world;  bringing the company to  a 
virtual halt for over two weeks.  Immediately after getting their 
computers back up and running, they were struck by several  Free-
dom viruses which were designed to destroy the hard disks on  the 
computers.  

As of this date, Alytech still has over 10,000 computers  sitting 
idly  waiting  for the much delayed shipments of hard  disks  re-
quired to repair the machines.

A spokesman for Alytech, Inc. says that the lawsuit is  frivolous 
and without merit. 

A  date of June 14 has been set for the courts to hear the  first 
of many rounds of motions.

     Paris, France

Spring in Paris is more glorious than any reviewer can adequately 
portray.  

The  clear air bristles with fresh anticipation like lovers on  a 
cool  afternoon.  Bicycles, free from a winter of hiding  in  ga-
rages, fill the streets and parks.  All of Paris enjoys the first 
stroll of the year.

Coats  and jackets are prematurely shed in favor of t-shirts  and 
skimpy tank-tops and the cafes teem with alfresco activity.   The 
lucky  low-season  American  tourist  experiences  firsthand  the 
French foreplay to summer. 

Looking  down  to the streets from the 'deuziemme tage'  of  the 
Eiffel Tower, only a hundred feet up, the sheer number of stroll-
ers,  of  pedestrian cruisers, of tourists and of the  idly  lazy 
occupies the whole of one's vista. 

Martin Templer leaned heavily on the wrought iron railing of  the 
restaurant  level,  soaking  up the tranquility  of  the  perfect 
Sunday  afternoon. He gazed across the budding  tree-lined  Seine 
toward the Champs Elyse and the Arc de Triumph; from Notre  Dame 
to the skyscrapered Ile de la Cit.  He mentally noted the incon-
gruity  between  the aura of peace that Paris radiated  with  its 
often  violent history.  He hoped nothing today would break  that 
spell.

A  sudden  slap on the back aroused Templer from his  sun  warmed 
daydream.  He turned his head in seeming boredom.  "You'd make  a 
lousy pickpocket."

"That's  why I avoided a life of crime."  Alexander Spiradon  was 
immaculately  dressed, down to the properly folded silk  handker-
chief  in his suit jacket.  "How are you today my friend?  Did  I 
interrupt your reverie?"

Templer  swung  his  London Fog over his  shoulder.   His  casual 
slacks and stylish light weight sweater contrasted severely  with 
Alex's  comfortable air of formality.  "I don't get  here  often.  
Paris  is a very special place," Templer mused, turning from  his 
view of the city to face his old comrade.

"It  is  indeed," agreed Alex.  "Then why do you look  so  melan-
choly?  Does Paris bring you memories of sadness?"

"I hope not," Templer said, eyes down.  

"You  didn't give me much notice," Alex said good naturedly.   "I 
left  the most beautiful woman in the world in a jacuzzi  at  St. 
Moritz."

"No,  I'm  sorry. I know I didn't, but it was  urgent.   Couldn't 
wait."  A slight breeze caused Templer to shiver.  He slowly  put 
on  his  tan rain coat and looked right into Alex's  eyes.   "I'm 
going to ask you straight."

Alex confidently grinned.  "Ask what?"

"Was  Taki Homosoto a client of yours?"  The biting words  seemed 
to have little impact on Alex.

"My clients trust me to keep their identities confidential."  The 
expression on Alex's face didn't change.

"The  guy's dead.  What the hell can it hurt?"  Templer  laughed.  
"What's he gonna do?  Sue you for breach of contract?"

Alex didn't say a word.  He saw Templer laugh the confident laugh 
of a chess player one move from checkmate and he realized how un-
comfortable a position this was for him.  How do you behave  when 
you're on the losing end of the stick?  Alex was thinking like he 
cared  what  Templer  knew or thought.  In  reality,  though,  he 
didn't  care any more about what anyone thought of him.   He  had 
enough money, more than enough money, to lead a lavish  lifestyle 
without worry.  So what did it matter.  As friends nothing  would 
change  between him and Martin.  But professionally, that  was  a 
different matter.

"I'd love to tell you, but, it's a matter of ethics,"  Alex  said 
happily.  "You understand."  

"It  really doesn't matter," laughed Templer.  "Let's walk.   The 
wind's picking up."   They unconsciously joined in the  spontane-
ous promenade of walkers who shuffle around the mid level of  the 
Tower to share in the ambience that only Paris offers.

"You know, I'm officially retired," Alex said breathing in  deep-
ly.

"I'm not surprised.  Must have been a very profitable endeavor."

"I  saved a little and made prudent investments,"  Alex lied  and 
Templer knew it.  No need to push the point.

"How well did Sir George do?  He wouldn't tell us."

Alex  stopped  in his tracks and glared at Martin  with  a  blank 
emotionless  expression  for several seconds until his  deep  set 
brown eyes began to twinkle.   A knowing smile and nod of  recog-
nition  of accomplishment followed, telling Martin he had  hit  a 
home  run.   "You're good. Very good."  They both  began  walking 
again,  as if on cue.  "For future edification, how did you  find 
him?"

"Them.  Sir George was the most helpful, though."

"I  remember him.  Real character, kind of helpless but with  the 
gift  of gab."  Alex seemed unconcerned that any of  his  network 
had been discovered.  "He talked?"

"Second rate criminal.  Definitely deportable."

"And you made him an offer he couldn't refuse."

"Something  like that," Templer said coyly.  "Let's just  say  he 
prefers the vineyards of California to the prisons in England."

Alex nodded in understanding.  "How'd you find him?" 

"Telephone records."

"That's impossible," Alex said, shrugging off Martin's answer.

"Never  underestimate the power of silicon," Martin said  crypti-
cally.

"Computers?  No way," Alex said defiantly.  "Every year there are 
almost  40  billion calls made within the  United  States  alone.  
There's no way to trace that many calls."

"Who  needs  to trace?"  Templer enjoyed the  joust.   Thus  far.  
"The  phone company is kind enough to keep records of every  call 
made.   Both local and long distance.   They're all  rather  com-
plete.   From what number, to what number, if it's forwarded,  to 
what number and at what time and for how long.  They also tell us 
if  the calls were voice, fax, or other types of  communications. 
It  even  identifies telephone connections that  use  encryption.  
Believe me, those are flagged right off."

"You  monitor  every  conversation?  I thought it  was  just  the 
overseas calls.  That's incredible.  Incredibly illegal."

"But necessary.  The threat of terrorism inside the United States 
has  reached unacceptable levels, and we had the capability.   It 
was just a matter of flipping the switch."  

"Since  when can you do that?"  Alex asked, stunned that  he  had 
overlooked, or underestimated a piece of the equation. 

"Since  the phone company computers were connected to  the  Fort. 
And,  I guarantee you, it's not something they want  advertised," 
Martin said in a low voice.  "Did you fuck up?"  They had circled 
the Tower twice and stopped back where they started,  overlooking 
the Seine.  

Alex's  professional composure returned as they leaned  over  the 
Tower's railing. 

"I  guess  I  wasn't as right as I  usually  am,"  he  snickered.  
Templer followed suit.   "How many did you get?"

"How many are there?"

"That would be telling," Alex said coyly.

"I  assume, then, that you would be averse to helping us  out  of 
our  current dilemma."  Being friends with potential  adversaries 
made this part of the job all the more difficult.

"Well,"  Alex  said turning his head toward Martin.  "I  guess  I 
could  be  talked into one more job, just one, if the  price  was 
right."

Templer shook his head.  "That's not the right answer."

Alex  was  taken off guard by the sullenness in  Martin's  voice.  
"Right  answer?  There are no right and wrongs in  our  business.  
Only  shades of gray.  You know that.  We ride a fence,  and  the 
winds blow back and forth.  It's not personal."

Martin  straightened up and put both hands deep into the  pockets 
of  his  London  Fog.  "Among the professionals,  yes.   But  Sir 
George  and  his cronies, and you by default,  broke  the  rules. 
Civilians are off limits.  We were hoping that you would want  to 
help."

Alex ignored the second request.  "I won't do it again.  I  prom-
ise," he said haughtily.

"Is  there  anything  I can say that will  make  you  reconsider?  
Anything at all?"  Martin implored.

"No,"  Alex said.  "Unless we can discuss an  equitable  arrange-
ment."

Martin took his hands out of his pockets and said, "I don't think 
that will work.  I'm sorry."  

"Sorry?"

Martin quickly moved his right hand up to Alex's neck and touched 
it  briefly.   Alex  reached up and slapped his  neck  as  terror 
overtook  his face.  He grabbed Martin's arm and twisted it  with 
his  free  hand to expose a small needle tipped  dart  projecting 
from  a  ring on one finger.  Templer wrested his arm  free  from 
Alex's  weakening clutch and tore off the ring, tossing  it  away 
from the Tower. 

Alex  weakened further as he leaned both hands on the railing  to 
steady  himself.   His mouth gaped wide, intense fear  and  utter 
disbelief  competing for control of his facial  muscles.   Martin 
ignored  his collapsing adversary and walked deliberately to  the 
open elevator which provided escape down to street level.  Before 
the  doors  had  closed, Templer saw a crowd  converge  over  the 
crumpled body of Alexander Spiradon.

Martin Templer crossed the Seine and performed evasive  maneuvers 
to  make sure he was not being followed.  The  cleansing  process 
took  about three hours.  He  flagged down a taxi  and  the  most 
uncooperative  driver refused to acknowledge he  understood  that 
the  destination was the American Embassy on Gabriel.  Only  when 
Templer  flashed  a 100 Franc note did the driver's  English  im-
prove.

Templer showed his CIA credentials to the Marine Sergeant at  the 
security desk, and told him he needed access to a secure communi-
cations channel to Washington. 

After  his identity was verified, Templer was permitted  to  send 
his message.  It was electronically addressed to his superiors at 
CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

          PLATO COULDN'T COME OUT AND PLAY.
          UNFORTUNATE STROKE INTERRUPTED THE INTERVIEW.

     National Security Agency

He  had two separate offices, each with a unique character.   One 
ultra modern and sleek, the other befitting a country  gentleman.  
The  two  were connected by a large anteroom that  also  provided 
immediate  access and departure by a private elevator and  escape 
stairs.  He could hold two meetings at once as  was  occasionally 
required  in his position as DIRNSA, Director, National  Security 
Agency.  Each office had its own secretary and private  entrance, 
selected for use depending upon whom was expected.  

The meeting in the nouveau office was winding down to a close and 
the  conversation  had been reduced to friendly  banter.   Marvin 
Jacobs  had  brought  in three of his senior  advisors  who  were 
coordinating  the massive analytical computing power of  the  NSA 
with  the extraordinary volume of raw data that all of  the  5ESS 
switches downloaded daily.  

Since they had been assigned to assist the FBI, the NSA had  been 
hunting down the locations of the potential conspirators with the 
assistance  of  the  seven Baby Bells and  Bell  Laboratories  in 
Princeton,  New Jersey.  The gargantuan task was delicately  bal-
ancing  a  fine line between chaos and  stagnancy;  legality  and 
amorality.

As they spoke, Jacobs heard a tone emit from his computer and  he 
noticed that Office-2 had a Priority Visitor.

"Gentlemen,"  Marvin Jacobs said as he stood.  "It seems that  my 
presence  is required for a small matter.  Would you mind  enter-
taining yourselves for a few minutes?"  His solicitous nature and 
political clout demanded that his visitors agree without  hesita-
tion.

He  walked over to a door by the floor to ceiling  bookshelf  and 
let himself in, through the gracious ante-room by the commode and 
into  his heavy wood and leather office.  He immediately saw  the 
reason for the urgency.

"Miles,  Miles  Foster,  my boy!  How are  you?"   Marvin  Jacobs 
walked straight to Miles, vigorously shook his hand and gave  him 
a big friendly bear hug. 

Miles  smiled from ear to ear.  "It's been cold out there.   Glad 
to be home."  He looked around the room and nodded  appreciative-
ly.  "You've been decorating again."

"Twice.   You haven't been in this office for, what is  it,  five 
years?"   Jacobs held Miles by the shoulders.  "My God it's  good 
to see you.  You don't look any the worse for wear."

"I had a great boss, treated me real nice," Miles said.

"Come  here,  sit  down," Marvin said ushering Miles  over  to  a 
thickly padded couch.  "If you don't already know it, this  coun-
try owes you a debt of thanks."

"I  know,"  Miles said, even though he had been paid  over  three 
million dollars by Homosoto.

"A  drink,  son?"  At fifty-five, the red  faced  paunch  bellied 
Jacobs  looked old enough to be Miles' father, even  though  they 
were only fifteen years apart.  

"Glenfiddich  on  the rocks."  Miles felt  comfortable.   Totally 
comfortable and in control of the situation.  

"Done."  DIRNSA Jacobs pressed a button which caused a hidden bar 
to  be  exposed from a mirror paneled wall.   The  James  Bondish 
tricks amused Miles.  "Excuse me," he said to Miles.  "Let me get 
rid of my other appointments."  Jacobs handed Miles the drink and 
leaned  over his desk speaking into telephone.   "Uh, Miss  Gree-
ley, cancel my dates for the rest of the day, would you please?" 

"Of course, sir."  The thin female voice came across the  speaker 
phone clearly.  

"And my regrets to the gentlemen in One."

"Yessir."  The intercom audibly clicked off. 

"So," Marvin asked, "how does it feel to be both the goat and the 
hero?"

"Hey,  I  fixed it, just like we planned, didn't I?"  Miles  said 
arrogantly, but his deep dimples said he was joking. "I  remember 
everything  you  taught me," he bragged.  "Lesson  One:   If  you 
really  want to fix something, first you gotta fuck it up so  bad 
everyone takes notice.  Well, how'd I do?"  Miles still  grinned, 
his  dimples radiating a star pattern across his cheeks.   Jacobs 
approved whole heartedly.

"You were a natural.  From day one."

"Homosoto  thought that fuck-it to fix-it was entirely too  weird 
at  first, so I quit calling it that."  Miles  fondly  remembered 
those early conversations.  "As you said, it takes a disaster  to 
motivate Americans, and we gave them one."

"I'm  glad  you see it that way," Marvin said  obligingly.    "It 
occurred to me that you might have gotten soft on me."

"Not  a  chance."  Miles countered.  "How many men  get  to  lead 
armies,  first of all.  And I may be the first, ever, to lead  an 
invasion  of my own country with my government's approval.   This 
was  a sanctioned global video game.  I should thank you for  the 
opportunity."

"That's a hell of a way to look at it, my boy.  You show a lot of 
courage."   Marvin  drank  to Miles' health.  "It  takes  men  of 
courage  to  run  a  country, and that's  what  we  do;  run  the 
country."    Miles  had heard many of Marvin's  considerable  and 
conservative  speeches before, but this one was new.  After  over 
five years, that was to be expected.

"It  doesn't make a damn bit of difference who the President  is.  
The Government stays the same regardless of who's elected every 4 
years."  Marvin continued as Miles listened reverently.

"The  American  public thinks that politicians run  the  country; 
they  think that they vote for the people who make the  policies, 
who  set  the tone of the government, but they are so  wrong.  So 
wrong."  Marvin shook his head side to side.  "And it's  probably 
just as well that they never find out for sure."  He held  Miles' 
attention.  Marv walked around the room drink in hand,  gesturing 
with his hands and arms.

"The hundreds of thousands of Government employees, the ones that 
are  here  year after year after year, we are the ones  who  make 
policy.  It's the mid-grade manager, the staff writer, the polit-
ical analysts who create the images, the pictures that the  White 
House and Capital Hill see.  

"This  town, the United States is run by lifers; people who  have 
dedicated their lives to the American way of life.  The  military 
controls more than any American wants to know.  State Department, 
Justice,  HUD; each is its own monolithic bureaucracy  that  does 
not  change direction overnight because of some election in  Bum-
fuck,  Iowa.   It takes four years to find your way  through  the 
corridors, and by then, odds are you'll be packing back to Maine, 
or  Georgia  or California or wherever you  came  from."   Marvin 
Jacob's  vitriolic oration was grinding on Miles, but he  had  to 
listen to his boss.

"So when this country gets into trouble, someone has to do  some-
thing  about it.  God knows the politicians won't.  This  country 
was  in real trouble and someone had to fix it. In this  case  it 
was  me.  It's been a decade since the first warnings  about  how 
vulnerable our computers, our economy, shit, our National Securi-
ty  were.  The reports came out, and Congress decided  to  ignore 
them.  Sure, they built up the greatest armaments in the  history 
of civilization, sold the future for a few trillion, but they ne-
glected  to  protect their investment."   Jacobs  angrily  poured 
himself another drink.

"I couldn't let that happen, so I decided that I needed to expose 
the weaknesses in our systems before somebody else did."   Marvin 
spoke  proudly.  "And what better way than to fuck it  up  beyond 
all  recognition.  FUBAR.  At least this way we were  in  charge, 
and  we  were able to pick the damage.  Thanks to  you.   Lessons 
tend to be painful, and I guess we're paying for some of our past 
sins."  He drank thirstily.  

"Did those sins mean that I would have to be arrested by the FBI?  
I  couldn't  say a thing; not the truth.  They'd never  have  be-
lieved  me."  Miles shuddered at the thought.  "For a  moment,  I 
thought you might leave me to rot in jail."

"Hey," Marvin said happily. "Didn't our people get you out,  just 
like  I  promised? Less than an hour."  He sounded proud  of  his 
efforts.   "Besides,  most of them were  bullshit  charges.   Not 
worth the effort to prosecute."

"I  never  underestimate the power of the  acronym,"  Miles  said 
about the NSA, CIA and assorted lettered agencies.  "There was  a 
lot  of  not so quiet whispering when it was  released  that  the 
charges  were dropped by the Federal Prosecutor.  Think that  was 
smart, so soon?  Maybe we should have waited a couple of months."

Jacobs  looked up sharply at Miles' criticism of his actions  but 
spoke  with understanding.  "We needed to get the cameras off  of 
you  and  onto the real problem; it was the right  thing  to  do.  
Your  part is over.  You started the war.  Now it's up to  me  to 
stop  it.  It could not have gone any smoother.  Yes,"    he  re-
flected.   "It's  time for us to take over.  You  have  performed 
magnificently.  We couldn't ask for any more."

Miles  sipped  at his drink accepting the  reasoning  and  asked, 
"I've wondered about a few things, since the beginning."

"Now's  as good a time as any," Marv said edging  himself  behind 
his desk.  "I'd imagine you have a lot of holes to fill in."

"How did you get Homosoto to cooperate?  He seemed to fall  right 
into place."

"It  was almost too easy," Jacobs commented casually.  "We had  a 
number  of candidates.  You'd be surprised how many  people  with 
money  and power hold grudges against Uncle Sam,"  he  snickered.  
"It's hard to believe, but true."

"Meaning, if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else?"

"Exactly.   There's no shortage of help in the revenge  business. 
There are still many hibakusha, survivors of Hiroshima and  Naga-
saki, who still want revenge on us for ending the war and  saving 
so  may lives.  Ironic, isn't it?  That someone like Homosoto  is 
twisted enough to help us, just to fuel his own hatred,"   Marvin 
Jacobs asked rhetorically.  

"But he didn't know he was helping, did he?" Miles asked.

"Of  course not.  Then he would have been running the  show,  and 
this was my production.  No, it worked out just fine."

Jacobs paused for more liquor and continued.  "Then we have a few 
European industrialists, ex-Nazis who are available . . .the KGB, 
GRU,  Colombian  cartel  members. The list  of  assets  is  long.  
Where's there's money, there's help, and most of them prefer  the 
Yankee dollar to any other form of payment.   They forget that by 
hurting us they also hurt the world's largest economy, as well as 
everybody  else's  and  then the fiscal  dominoes  start  falling 
uncontrollably."

"You mean you bought him?"  Miles asked.

"Oh, no!  You can't buy a billionaire, but you can influence  his 
actions,  if  he thinks that it's his idea.  It just  so  happens 
that he was the first one to bite.  Health problems and all."

"What problems?"

"In all likelihood it's from the radiation, the Bomb; his doctors 
gave  him  a  couple  of  years  to  live.   Inoperable  form  of 
leukemia."

"I didn't know . . ."

"No one did. He insisted on complete secrecy.  He had not  picked 
a successor to run OSO, and in some ways he denied the reality."

"Excuse  my tired old brain, but you're talking Spook-Speak.  How 
did you know . . .?"

"Old habits . . ."  Marvin agreed.  "As you well know, from  your  
employ here, we have assets in every major company in the  world.  
Especially those companies that buy and sell elected officials in 
Washington.   OSO and Homosoto are quite guilty of bribing  their 
way into billions of dollars of contracts.  Our assets, you  see, 
can  work  in two directions.  They let us know what's  going  on 
from  the  inside and give us a leg up on the G2.  Then,  we  can 
plant  real or false information when needed.  The Cold  Economic 
War."

"So you told Homosoto what to do?"  Miles followed closely.

"Not  in  so many words."  Marvin wasn't telling all,  and  Miles 
knew  it.  "We knew that through our assets we gave Homosoto  and 
several others the idea that U.S. computers were extremely  frag-
ile.   Back in 1983 the DoD and CIA prepared  classified  reports 
saying that computer terrorism was going to be the  international 
crime of choice in the last decade of the century.  Then the NRC, 
NSC and DIA issued follow-up reports that agreed with the  origi-
nal  findings.  We saw to it that enough detail reached Tokyo  to 
show just how weak we were."

Jacobs continued to tell Miles how the NSA effected the unwitting 
recruitment of Homosoto.  "That, a well timed resignation on your 
part,  and advertising your dissatisfaction with  the  government 
made  you the ideal person to launch the attack."  Marvin  smiled 
widely holding his drink in the air, toasting Miles.

Miles  responded by raising his glass.  "And then a suicide,  how 
perfect."    Jacobs  did not return the salute,  and  Miles  felt 
sudden iciness.  "Right?  Homosoto's suicide."  Jacobs still said 
nothing.  "Marv?  It was a suicide, wasn't it?"  

"Miss Perkins was of great help, too," Marvin said ignoring Miles 
questions. 

"Perky?  What's she got to do with this?"  Miles demanded. 

"Oh?  You really don't know?"  Marvin was genuinely shocked.   "I 
guess  she was better than we thought.  I thought you knew."   He 
looked  down  to  avoid  Miles's  eyes.   "Didn't  you  think  it 
odd . . .?"

"That she introduced me to Homosoto?"  Miles asked acrimoniously.  

"She didn't."

"Of course she did," Miles contradicted.

"We  have a tape of the conversation," Marv disagreed.  "All  she 
did was ask you if you would work for a foreigner and under  what 
circumstances.   Perkins'  job was to prep you  for  Homosoto  or 
whoever  else we expected to contact you.  An admirable job,  huh 
Miles?"   Marvin Jacobs seemed proud of her accomplishments,  and 
given  the  stunned gaping expression on Miles' face,  he  beamed 
even  more.   Miles didn't say a word, but his glazed  eyes  said 
loud and clear that he felt defiled.  

"I'm  sorry Miles," Marvin said compassionately.  "I  really  as-
sumed  you  knew that she was a toy.  You certainly  treated  her 
that way."  No reaction.  "If it helps any, she was on Homosoto's 
payroll.  She was a double."

Miles jerked his head back and then let out a long laugh.  "Well, 
fuck me dead.  Goddamn, she was good!  Had me going. Not a  fuck-
ing clue."  Miles stood from his chair and laughed and smiled  at 
Marvin.  "What a deal.  I get blow jobs courtesy of the  American 
taxpayer and you get paid to watch."

"Miles, we know how you felt for her . . ."

"Bullshit,"  Miles said quickly.  "That's fucking bullshit."   He 
pounded on the desk.

"She's already on another assignment,"  Marvin said calmly.  

Miles  couldn't  completely hide the dejection,  the  feeling  of 
loss,  no  matter how loudly he denied it.   "Fuck  her!"   Miles 
exclaimed.  He walked over to the high tech bar and made  himself 
another strong drink. Perfect drink to get dumped by.  "Another?" 
he asked Marvin who handed Miles his glass for a refill.

"As I was saying," Marvin said,  "this country owes you a thanks, 
beyond  any medals or awards, and unfortunately, there is no  way 
we can publicly express our appreciation."  Marvin sat down  with 
his drink and addressed Miles.

"Hey,"  Miles  said holding his hands in front of him.   "I  knew 
that  going  into the deal.  I did my job, for  my  country,  and 
maybe I lose some face, but I didn't do this for fame.   Retiring 
in style, maybe the Alps is a nice consolation prize."  The pain, 
so evident seconds ago about Stephanie, was gone.  Miles  gloated 
in his achievement. 

A  low  warble came from the phone on Marvin's desk.  He  read  a 
message that appeared on the small message screen attached to the 
phone  and  struck a few keys in response.  At that  moment,  the 
double  doors  from  the Office-2 reception opened  and  in  came 
Tyrone Duncan and two other FBI agents.  Miles turned to see  who 
was  interrupting  their meeting.  It was the same  man  who  had 
arrested him a few weeks before.  

Miles   gulped deeply and felt his heart skip a beat.  'What  the 
hell is going on', he thought.  He quickly glanced at Jacobs. His 
pulse  and respiration increased to the point of skin  sweat  and 
near hyper-ventilation.

Tyrone  spoke to the Director.  "Mr. Jacobs, we are here  to  see 
Mr. Foster."   Jacobs gestured to Miles in the deep chair  across 
from the marble desk. 

Miles' mind raced.  What was Marv doing? And Duncan again?

"Mr.  Foster,"  Tyrone Duncan said.  Miles looked up.   "You  are 
under arrest for violation of the espionage and sedition laws  of 
the United States of America.  In addition, you are charged  with 
violating  the Official Secrets Act and  . . ."  Tyrone read  off 
94  federal crimes including racketeering and 61 assorted  counts 
of conspiracy.

As  Tyrone read the extended list of charges, Miles shook to  his 
core,  turned  to Marvin in abject terror.  His face  cried  out, 
'please,  help me.'  Jacobs watched with indifference  as  Tyrone 
continued with the new charges.

"You  have the right to remain silent . . ."  Tyrone  read  Miles 
his Miranda rights as he lifted him from the chair to put on  the 
cuffs. 

"Marv!"  Miles shouted in panic.  "This is a joke, and  it's  not 
funny . . .Marv . . .Jesus Fucking Christ!"  Miles struggled like 
an  animal.  He thought he was free. "I'm the fucking fish  food.  
Aren't I?  Marv," he shouted even louder.  "Aren't I?"

"It  seems  to me that you've dug your own grave, son.   I  can't 
tell  you how disappointed I am in your actions."  Jacobs  played 
the role perfectly.

"You fucking liar!  The President doesn't even know about what  I 
did for you? Does he?"  Miles was screaming as Tyrone and another 
agent  restrained him by the arms.  "Why not?  You told  me  that 
this project had approval from the highest level." 

"Are you mad?"  Marvin sounded like a caring parent admonishing a 
misbehaving  lad who knew no better. "Do you think that he  would 
have approved of such a plan?  Ruin his own country?  Is that why 
you went to Homosoto?  Because we said you were crazy?"

"You  told  me he approved it!" Miles screamed at  Marvin.   "You 
lied!  About that, about Stephanie, what else have you lied to me 
about?" 

Jacobs sat silently as Tyrone turned the handcuffed Miles  toward 
the door.

"Why don't you just admit it?  I'm the fucking fall guy for  your 
scheme, aren't I?" Miles shouted. "Admit it goddamnit, admit it!"

Jacobs  looked down at his desk and shook his head from  side  to 
side as if he were terribly disappointed. 

"I'll  get  you, I will get you for this,"  Miles  shrieked.   "I 
trusted you, like a father and then you fuck me.  Fucked me  like 
every other dumb shit that works here."  His vicousness  intensi-
fied. "Suck my dick!" he shouted with finality.

Tyrone tugged at Miles to keep him from the Director's desk.  "Is 
there anything else Director Jacobs?"

"Yes,  Agent Duncan, here."  Jacobs opened a drawer   and  pulled 
out  a large envelope, marked with Miles' name.  Miles stared  at 
it,  eyes  bulging  with fear.  Tyrone  looked  questioningly  at 
Marvin.

"I  believe  you will find enough in there to put Mr.  Foster  in 
Tokyo  with Mr. Homosoto at the time he died."  Tyrone  took  the 
package.   "I think the Tokyo Police would be most interested  in 
making a possible case for murder."

Miles screamed, "scum bucket! You're fucking nuts."  His  vicious 
verbal assaults were aimed directly at  Marvin who ignored  them.  
"You  know  I had nothing to do . . .goddamn you!  I  spend  five 
years of my life helping my country and you  . . ."

"I  think very few would agree that what you've done can be  con-
sidered helpful."

"I will get even!  Even, do you hear!"  Miles' voice was  getting 
hoarse from the outrageous tirade.

DIRNSA  Marvin Jacobs raised his right hand to Tyrone  indicating 
that  Miles was dismissed.  Miles continued bellowing  at  Marvin 
and  Tyrone  and the two other agents tried to keep him  in  tow.  
When  they  had  left, and the door closed  behind  them,  Jacobs 
pushed a button on his phone and spoke casually.

"Miss Greeley? Could you please get me a 2:00 P.M. tee off time?"

     The Year After

The  newspaper  headlines  during the first year  of  the  attack 
revealed  as  much about the effects of the attacks  on  American 
society, its politics and economy as could any biased  editorial.  
They ironically and to the dismay of many of those in the govern-
ment, echoed the pulse of the country, regardless of the  politi-
cal leaning of the Op-Ed pages.

     Power to the People
     by Scott Mason

The  last  few months have taught me, and this country,  a  great 
deal  about the technology that has been allowed to  control  our 
lives.   Computers,  mainframes, mini computers, or  millions  of 
personal  computers  - they do in fact control  and  monitor  our 
every  activity, for better or for worse.  A marriage of  conven-
ience?

Now, though, it appears to be for worse.

I am reminded of the readings of Edgar Cayce and the stories that 
surround  the myth of Atlantis.  According to Cayce  and  legend, 
Atlantis was an ancient ante-deluvian civilization that developed 
a  fabulous  technology which achieved  air  flight,  levitation, 
advanced medical techniques and harnessed the sun's energy.

However, the power to control the technology which had exclusive-
ly  been controlled by the high priests of Atlantis was lost  and 
access  to the technology was handed to the many peoples of  that 
ancient culture.  Through a series of unintentional yet  reckless 
events,  the Atlanteans lost control of the technology,  and  de-
spite the efforts of the Priests,  their cities and cultures were 
destroyed,  eventually causing Atlantis to sink to the bottom  of 
the depths of the Atlantic Ocean.

Believing in the myth of Atlantis is not necessary to  understand 
that the distribution of incredible computing power to 'everyman' 
augers a similar fate to our computerized society.  We  witnessed 
our  traffic  systems come a halt, bringing grid  lock  to  small 
rural  communities.  Our banks had to reconstruct  millions  upon 
millions  of transactions in the best possible attempt at  recon-
ciliation.  The defensive readiness of our military was in  ques-
tion  for some time before the Pentagon was satisfied  that  they 
had cleansed their computers.

The  questions that arise are clearly ones to which there are  no 
satisfying responses.  Should 'everyman' have unrestrained access 
to tools that can obviously be used for offensive and threatening 
purposes?   Is  there a level of responsibility  associated  with 
computer usage? If so, how is it gauged?  Should the  businessman 
be  subject  to  additional regulations to  insure  security  and 
privacy?   Are additional laws needed to protect the  privacy  of 
the average citizen?  What guarantees do people have that  infor-
mation about them is only used for its authorized purpose?

Should 'everyman' have the ability to pry into anyone's  personal 
life, stored on hundreds of computers?

One  prominent   group calling themselves FYI, Freeflow  of  Your 
Information,  represented  by the ACLU, represents  one  distinct 
viewpoint  that  we  are likely to hear much  of  in  the  coming 
months.   They maintain that no matter what, if any,  restrictive 
mandates  are placed on computer users,  both are an invasion  of 
privacy  and violation of free speech have occurred.  "You  can't 
regulate  a pencil," has become their informal  motto  emblazoned 
across t-shirts on campuses everywhere.

While  neither  group has taken any overt legal  action,  FYI  is 
formidably equipped to launch a prolonged court battle.   Accord-
ing to spokesmen for FYI, "the courts are going to have to decide 
whether electronic free speech is covered by the First  Amendment 
of the Constitution.  If they find that it is not, there will  be 
a  popular uprising that will shake the foundation of this  coun-
try.  A constitutional crisis of the first order."

With threats of that sort, it is no wonder that most advocates of 
protective  and  security measures for computers are  careful  to 
avoid a direct confrontation with the FYI.

     A Day In The Life: 
     Without Computers
     by Scott Mason.

As  bad as a reformed smoker, but without the well earned  battle 
scars,  I  have been, upon occasion, known  to  lightly  ridicule 
those  who  profess the necessity of computers  to  enjoy  modern 
life.  I have been known as well to spout statistics;  statistics 
that show the average homemaker today spends more time homemaking 
than  her ancestor 100 or 200 years ago.  I have  questioned  the 
logic of laziness that causes us to pull out a calculator  rather 
than figure 10% of any given number.  

I have been proven wrong.

Last  Saturday  I really noticed the effects of the  Foster  Plan 
more  than  any time since it began.  I must  confess  that  even 
though  I  have written about hackers and computer crime,  it  is 
axiomatically  true  that  you don't notice it  till  it's  gone.  
Allow me to make my point.

Have  you recently tried to send a fax?  The digital phone  lines 
have  been  scrupulously pruned, and therefore busy most  of  the 
time.  

The check out lines at the supermarket have cob webs growing over 
the bar code price scanner.   The system that I used when I was a 
kid,  as a delivery boy for Murray and Mary Meyers  Meat  Market, 
seems to be back in vogue; enter the cost of the item in the cash 
register and check for mistakes when the receipt is produced. 

I  haven't  found one store in my neighborhood that  still  takes 
credit cards.  Have you noticed the near disdain you receive when 
you try to pay with a credit card?  Its real and perceived  value 
has been flushed right down the toilet.

Not  that  they don't trust my well known face and name,  but  my 
credit  cards  are  as suspect as are  everybody's.   Even  check 
cashing is scarce.  Seems like the best currency is that old time 
stand-by,  cash.  If you can make it to the bank.  The ATM at  my 
corner has been rented out to a flower peddler.

All  of  this  is happening in  reasonably  affluent  Westchester 
County.  And in impoverished East Los Angeles and in Detroit  and 
Miami  and  Boston and Atlanta and Dallas as well as  a  thousand 
Oshkosh's.   America  is  painfully learning what  life  is  like 
without automation.

     Hacker Heroes
     By Scott Mason

I have occasionally wreaked verbal havoc upon the hacker communi-
ty  as a whole, lumping together the good and the bad.  The  per-
formance of hackers  in recent months has contributed as much  to 
the  defense of the computers of this country as has the  govern-
ment itself.

An estimated one million computer users categorize themselves  or 
are categorized as hackers.  After the Homosoto bomb was  dropped 
on America, a spontaneous underground ad hoc hacker effort  began 
to  help  protect  the very systems that many of  them  has  been 
violating only the day before.  The thousands of bulletin  boards 
that normally display new methods of attacking computers,  invad-
ing  government networks, stealing telephone  service,  phreaking 
computers  and causing electronic disruptions, are now  competing 
for recognition.  

Newspapers  interested in providing the most up to date  informa-
tion  on fighting Homosoto's estimated 8000 viruses, and  methods 
of  making existing computers more secure have been using  hacker 
BBS's as sources.

     Ex Foster Girl Friend Key 
     Prosecution Witness
     by Scott Mason

A long time girl friend of Homosoto associate Miles Foster testi-
fied against her former lover in the Federal Prosecutor's treason 
case  against  him today.  Stephanie Perkins,  an  admitted  high 
class  call  girl, testified that she had been hired  to  provide 
services to Mr. Foster on an 'as-needed' basis.

Over  a period of four years, Ms. Perkins says she was paid  over 
$1 Million by a '. . .man named Alex . . .' and that she was paid 
in cash at a drop in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

She  stated that her arranged ralationship with Mr.  Foster  'was 
not  entirely  unpleasant,'  but she would  have  picked  someone 
'less egotistical and less consumed with himself.'   

"I was supposed to report his activities to Alex, and I saw a lot 
of the conversations on the computer."

"Did Foster work for Homosoto?"
     "Yes."
"What did he do?"
     "Built viruses, tried to hurt computers."
"Did you get paid to have sex with Mr. Foster?"
     "Yes."
"How many times?"
     "A few hundred, I guess."
"So you liked him?"
     "He was all right, I guess.  He thought I liked him."
"Why is that?"
     "It was my job to make him think so."
"Why?"
     "So I could watch him."
"What do you do for a living now?"
     "I'm retired."

     Security: The New Marketing Tool
     by Scott Mason

American  business always seems to turn a problem into a  profit, 
and the current computer confidence crisis is no different.

In spontaneous cases of simultaneous marketing genius, banks  are 
attempting to garner new customers as well as retain their exist-
ing customers.  As many banks continue to have unending difficul-
ties  in protecting their computers, the Madison Avenue  set  has 
found a theme that may set the tone of banking for years to come.

               Bank With Us: Your Money Is Safer.
                    Third Federal Savings and Loan

               Your Money Is Protected - Completely,
                    Mid South Alliance Bank

Banks have taken to advertising the sanctity of their vaults  and 
the protective measures many organizations have hastily installed 
since  the  Foster Plan was made public.  In an  attempt  to  win 
customers, banks have installed extra security measures to insure 
that  the electronic repositories that store billions of  dollars 
are adequately protected; something that banks and the ABA openly 
admit has been overlooked until recently.

The  new marketing techniques of promoting security are  not  the 
exclusive  domain of the financial community.   Insurance  compa-
nies, private lending institutions, police departments, hospitals 
and  most major corporations are announcing their  intentions  to 
secure their computers against future assaults.

The  press is often criticized for 'grand standing'  and  'sensa-
tionalizing' otherwise insignificant events into front page news, 
but  in  this case the government said little about  the  media's 
handling  of the situation.  In fact, privately, the White  House 
was pleased that the media, albeit loudly and crassly, was a  key 
element in getting the message to the American public:

               Secure Your Computers Or Else.

Everyone agreed with that.

     December 17
     Overlooking Charlotte Amalie, 
     St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands

"You must feel pretty good.  Pulitzer Prize. Half of the  writing 
awards for last year, nomination for Man of the Year."

"The  steaks  are burning."  The hype had been too  much.   Scott 
alone had to carry forward the standard.  He had become  expected 
to  lead a movement of protest and dissent.  Despite  his  pleas, 
his  neutrality as a reporter was in constant danger  of  compro-
mise.

"It's kind of strange talking to a living legend."  

Scott's deeply tanned body and lighter hair was quite a  contrast 
to the sickly paleness of New Yorkers in winter.  "Get the sprit-
zer, water the coals and then fuck yourself."

"Isn't this what you wanted?"  Tyrone scanned the exquisite  view 
from  the  estate sized homestead  overlooking  Charlotte  Amalie 
Harbor  on  St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.  The  safe  enclosed 
harbor  housed three cruise ships, but the hundreds of  sailboats 
in the clear Caribbean dominated the seascape.  

After  the last year, Scott had decided to finally take time  off 
for a proper honeymoon.  He and Sonja elected to spend an extend-
ed  holiday  on St. Thomas, in a rented house with a cook  and  a 
maid  and a diving pool and a satellite dish and all of the  lux-
uries of stateside living without the residual headaches.  

Their head over heels romance surprised no one but themselves and 
they  both  preferred to let the past stay a part  of  the  past.  
Scott  decided quickly to take Sonja at her word.  Her  past  was 
her past, and he had to not let it bother him or they would  have 
no future.  Even if he was one of her jobs for a short while. 

Scott's name was in constant demand as a result of his expos  of 
Homosoto  and  the  hackers.  Fame was something  Scott  had  not 
wanted specifically.  He had imagined himself the great  transla-
tor, making the cacophony of incomprehensible technical  polysyl-
labics intelligible to 'everyman'.  He had not planned for  fame; 
merely another demand on his time, his freedom and his  creativi-
ty.

"What I wanted was a break."  Scott poked at the steaks.  In  the 
pool  Arlene  Duncan and Sonja kicked their  feet  and  chattered 
aimlessly.   The perfect respite.  The Times made Scott the  most 
generous  tenure  offers in a generation of  writers,  and  Scott 
recognized  the fairness of the offers.  It was not now, nor  had 
it ever been a question of money, though.

"What's next?"

"The book, I suppose.  The Trial of Miles Foster."

"And then back to the Times?"

"Maybe,  maybe.   I haven't given it much  thought,"  Scott  said 
watering  down the coals to reduce the intensity of the  barbecue 
inferno he had created.  "I promised to help out once in a while.  
Officially they call it a sabbatical."

"How long do you think you can hold out on this rock before going 
nuts?"

"We've  managed  pretty well, so far."  Scott said  admiring  his 
bride whose phenomenal physical beauty was tightly wrapped in the 
high  French cut one piece bathing suit that Scott  insisted  she 
wear in honor of their more conservative guests.  Tyrone, he  was 
sure, would not have minded Sonja's nudity, but Arlene would have 
been on the next flight to Boston and her parents.

"Three months so far, and nine months to go.  I think I can  take 
it," he said staring at Sonja and motioning to the view.

Tyrone  silently conveyed understanding for Scott's choice of  an 
island  retreat  to get away from it all.  But  Tyrone's  choices 
demanded his presence within driving distance of civilization.

"So  the  bureau  wasn't too upset about  your  leaving?"   Scott 
changed the subject.

"I guess not," Tyrone said laughing.  "I was approaching mandato-
ry  anyway and I'd become too big a pain in their  asses.   Using 
your  hackers  didn't  endear me to too many  of  the  Director's 
staff."

"What about your friend?"

"You mean Bob Burnson?"

"Yeah, the guy we met at Ebbett's . . ."

"He got his promotion right after I left.  I guess I was  holding 
him back," Tyrone said with tongue in cheek.  "On the other hand, 
I  could have stayed and really made his life  miserable.   We're 
both at peace. Best of all? Still friends."  

"I  have  to say, though, I never thought you'd go  through  with 
it,"  said  Scott  turning the steaks.  "You and  the  Bureau,  a 
thirty year affair."

"Not quite thirty . . ."

"Whatever.   You've certainly built up a practice and a  half  in 
six months."

"Yeah," chuckled Tyrone.  "Like you, I never planned on  becoming 
a  big  player . . .Christ.  Who ever thought that  Computer  Law 
would be the next Cabbage Patch Doll of the courts?"  Tyrone  saw 
the smirk in Scott's face.  "O.K., you did.  Yes, you predicted a 
mess in the courts.  Yes, you did Mr. Wisenheimer.  I just saw it 
as a neat little extension of constitutional law and then whammo! 
All of sudden, computer litigation is the hip place to be.  Every 
type of lawsuit you predicted is somewhere in the legal system  - 
SEC  suits, copyright suits, privacy suits, theft of data,  theft 
of service."

"Sounds like everyone who was scared to admit they had a  problem 
in the past is going balls to the wall."

"The  Japanese  lawyers  are living their  worst  nightmare:  OSO 
Industries is up to top of its colon with lawsuits, including one 
asking for OSO to be denied any access to the American market for 
100 years."

Scott whistled long and loud, then laughed.  "And that's fun?"

"You're goddamned right, it's fun," Ty asserted, popping  another 
beer from the poolside cooler.  "It's a shit load more  interest-
ing  that rotting here," he spread his arms to embrace  the  lush 
beauty from their 1500 foot high aerie.  "How much sun and  peace 
and  quiet  and sex and water and beach can one  man  take?"   He 
spoke  loudly,  like a Southern Spiritual  Minister.   "Too  much 
scuba  diving  and  swimming and sailing and  sunsets  and  black 
starry  nights can be bad for your health.  This is  a  goddamned 
Hedonist's Heaven."  He brought his hands to his side and gave  a 
resigned sigh.  "I guess if you can stomach this kind of life."

"Jealous?"  Scott asked gently.  He knew about Arlene's reticence 
to  try anything new, out of the ordinary.  She was very  pleased 
with her life in Westchester.  She felt that knowing someone  who 
lived  in Paradise whom she could visit once a year was  new-ness 
enough. 

"No, man,"  Tyrone said genuinely, speaking as himself again.  "I 
got  exactly  what I wanted."  He cocked his head  at  the  pool, 
where  Arlene seemed more relaxed than she had in years.   "Can't 
you  see?  She's miserable, but she's mine.  Scott, you've  lived 
your fantasy, made a difference.  Now, it's my turn."

Scott  looked over at Arlene. "Hey, shit for brains," he said  to 
Tyrone.   "She's no slouch.  It's what the hell she's doing  with 
you  I  never understood."  Scott lunged at  Tyrone's  attention-
getting sized abdomen with the steak fork. 

"Nice and juicy," retorted Tyrone, patting his prominent stomach.

"You're  not  my type.  I like mine lean.  I cut  off  the  fat," 
Scott  barbed.  Before Tyrone could get in his jibe Scott  called 
out, "Steaks' on.  Outside black, inside mooing."  

The  girls  smacked  their lips in anticipation and  sat  in  the 
elegant  all weather PVC furniture.  A red sailor's  delight  sun 
was  mere  inches  above the horizon, setting to  the  west  over 
Hassel  and Water Islands which provide umbrage to  Blue  Beard's 
harbor of choice.

The  men were providing all services this evening and the  ladies 
were luxuriating in this rare opportunity.  Little did they know, 
or  little  did they let on, that they knew the men  enjoyed  the 
opportunity  to demonstrate their culinary skills without  female 
interference.  Beside, thought Scott, it was the maid's day off.

"Seriously,  though,"  Tyrone  said quietly as  Scott  piled  the 
plates  with steaks and potatoes.  "I know you better than  that.  
I  don't see how you can do nothing.  You don't know how  to  sit 
your  ass  still  for ten minutes.  It's  not  your  personality.  
Don't you agree Arlene?"

"Yes dear," she said, still talking to Sonja. 

"And that room you call your office, Jesus.  You have more equip-
ment in there than  . . ."

"It looks like more than it is . . ." Scott downplayed the point.  
"Mainly communications.  The local phone company is a joke, so  I 
installed an uplink.  No big deal."

"C'mon,  man,  I just can't see you sitting  on  the  sidelines." 
Tyrone stressed the word 'you'.  "Not with what's happening  now?  
There must be a thousand stories out there . . ."

"And a thousand and one reporters.  Too much noise, too busy  for 
my liking.  After the Homosoto story, if there's one luxury  I've 
learned to live with, it's that I can pick and choose what I do."  
Scott spoke much too reserved for the Scott Mason Tyrone knew. 

"Aha!  So  you are up to something.  I knew it. I gave  you  one, 
maybe two months, but I never figured you'd last three."

They carried the four plates laden with steaks and potatoes  over 
to  the  table where their spouses waited.  Fresh  beers  awaited 
their much appreciated efforts.

"I  do  get a little itchy and I read a lot."  Tyrone  glared  at 
Scott  with  disbelief.   "No really, just  a  little  research," 
laughed Scott in mock defense.  "O.K., I received a call, and  it 
sounded kind of interesting, so I've been looking into it."

"Poking around, here and there and everywhere?"

"Kinda, just following up a few leads."

"Just a few?"

"Well, maybe more than a few," Scott admitted.

"When  did this little project begin?" Tyrone  asked  accusingly.  
He suspected Scott was hiding a detail or two.

"It's not really a project . . ."

"Don't skirt the issue.  When?" 

Scott lowered his head.  "Two weeks after we got here."

Tyrone  stifled what might otherwise have become a volcanic  roar 
of laughter.  "Two weeks?  Ha!" Tyrone needled.  "You only lasted 
two  weeks?   How  did Sonja feel about that?"   He  looked  over 
Scott's at better half listen in.

"Ah, well, she sort of insisted . . ."

"You drove her nuts? In two weeks?"   Sonja shook her head vigor-
ously in agreement but kept speaking to Arlene Duncan. 

"Kind  of;  semi-sorta-kinda-maybe."   Scott  grinned   impishly.  
"But, yeah, I have been working on something."  He couldn't  keep 
it to himself.

"Dare I ask?"  

"Off the record?"  Scott sounded insistent.

"This  is a twist. How about attorney-client  privilege?"  Tyrone 
asked.   Scott didn't disagree.  "Good," said Tyrone. "Give me  a 
dollar.  That's my yearly fee."  

Scott  complied, finding a soaking wet dollar bill in his   swim-
ming trunks.  He laid it next to Tyrone's plate.

"Well?" Tyrone asked with great interest.

"Well,   I discovered we never developed the A-Bomb to end  World 
War II."

"Excuse me?"

"Someone gave it to us."
