THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT

"In the name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the Loyal
Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord, King James, by the Grace of God,
of England, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, e&.

Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the Chris-
tian Faith, and the Honour of our King and Country, a voyage to plant
the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia; do by these
presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and one of
another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body
Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of
the Ends aforesaid; And by Virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and
frame, such just and equal Laws, Ordinances, Acts, Constitutions and
Offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and con-
venient for the General good of the Colony; unto which we promise all
due submission and obedience.

In Witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names at Cape Cod
the eleventh of November, in the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, King
James of England, France and Ireland, the eighteenth, and of Scotland
the fifty-fourth. Anno Domini, 1620."

There followed the signatures of 41 of the 102 passengers, 37 of whom
were members of the "Separatists" who were fleeing religious persecu-
tion in Europe.  This compact established the first basis in the new
world for written laws. Half the colony failed to survive the first
winter, but the remainder lived on and prospered.
