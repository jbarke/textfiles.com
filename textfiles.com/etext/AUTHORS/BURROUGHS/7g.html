THE MONSTER MEN
by Edgar Rice Burroughs


Chapter 1, THE RIFT

[0;0;36mAs he dropped the last grisly fragment of the dismembered and 
mutilated body into the small vat of nitric acid that was to 
devour every trace of the horrid evidence which might easily 
send him to the gallows, the man sank weakly into a chair and 
throwing his body forward upon his great, teak desk buried his
face in his arms, breaking into dry, moaning sobs.

Beads of perspiration followed the seams of his high, wrinkled 
forehead, replacing the tears which might have lessened the 
pressure upon his overwrought nerves. His slender frame shook, 
as with ague, and at times was racked by a convulsive shudder. 
A sudden step upon the stairway leading to his workshop brought 
him trembling and wide eyed to his feet, staring fearfully at the
locked and bolted door.

Although he knew perfectly well whose the advancing footfalls were, 
he was all but overcome by the madness of apprehension as they came 
softly nearer and nearer to the barred door. At last they halted 
before it, to be followed by a gentle knock.

"Daddy!" came the sweet tones of a girl's voice.

The man made an effort to take a firm grasp upon himself that no tell-
tale evidence of his emotion might be betrayed in his speech.

"Daddy!" called the girl again, a trace of anxiety in her voice this 
time. "What IS the matter with you, and what ARE you doing?  You've 
been shut up in that hateful old room for three days now without a
morsel to eat, and in all likelihood without a wink of sleep. You'll 
kill yourself with your stuffy old experiments."

The man's face softened. "Don't worry about me, sweetheart," he replied 
in a well controlled voice. "I'll soon be through now -- soon be 
through -- and then we'll go away for a long vacation -- for a long 
vacation."

"I'll give you until noon, Daddy," said the girl in a voice which 
carried a more strongly defined tone of authority than her father's 
soft drawl, "and then I shall come into that room, if I have to use an 
axe, and bring you out--do you understand?"

Professor Maxon smiled wanly. He knew that his daughter was equal 
to her threat.

"All right, sweetheart, I'll be through by noon for sure -- by noon 
for sure. Run along and play now, like a good little girl."

Virginia Maxon shrugged her shapely shoulders and shook her head 
hopelessly at the forbidding panels of the door.

"My dolls are all dressed for the day," she cried, "and I'm tired of 
making mud pies -- I want you to come out and play with me."  But 
Professor Maxon did not reply -- he had returned to view his grim 
operations, and the hideousness of them had closed his ears to the 
sweet tones of the girl's voice.

As she turned to retrace her steps to the floor below Miss Maxon 
still shook her head.

"Poor old Daddy," she mused, "were I a thousand years old, wrinkled 
and toothless, he would still look upon me as his baby girl."

If you chance to be an alumnus of Cornell you may recall Professor 
Arthur Maxon, a quiet, slender, white-haired gentleman, who for several 
years was an assistant professor in one of the departments of natural 
science. Wealthy by inheritance, he had chosen the field of education 
for his life work solely from a desire to be of some material benefit 
to mankind since the meager salary which accompanied his professorship
was not of sufficient import to influence him in the slightest degree.

Always keenly interested in biology, his almost unlimited means had 
permitted him to undertake, in secret, a series of daring experiments 
which had carried him so far in advance of the biologists of his day 
that he had, while others were still groping blindly for the secret of
life, actually reproduced by chemical means the great phenomenon.

Fully alive to the gravity and responsibilities of his marvellous 
discovery he had kept the results of his experimentation, and even the
experiments themselves, a profound secret not only from his colleagues,
but from his only daughter, who heretofore had shared his every hope 
and aspiration.

It was the very success of his last and most pretentious effort that 
had placed him in the horrifying predicament in which he now found 
himself -- with the corpse of what was apparently a human being in his
workshop and no available explanation that could possibly be acceptable
to a matter-of-fact and unscientific police.

Had he told them the truth they would have laughed at him. Had he said:
"This is not a human being that you see, but the remains of a 
chemically produced counterfeit created in my own laboratory," they 
would have smiled, and either hanged him or put him away with the other
criminally insane.

This phase of the many possibilities which he had realized might be 
contingent upon even the partial success of his work alone had escaped 
his consideration, so that the first wave of triumphant exultation 
with which he had viewed the finished result of this last experiment 
had been succeeded by overwhelming consternation as he saw the thing 
which he had created gasp once or twice with the feeble spark of life 
with which he had endowed it, and expire -- leaving upon his hands the 
corpse of what was, to all intent and purpose, a human being, albeit a 
most grotesque and misshapen thing.

Until nearly noon Professor Maxon was occupied in removing the 
remaining stains and evidences of his gruesome work, but when he at 
last turned the key in the door of his workshop it was to leave behind 
no single trace of the successful result of his years of labor.

The following afternoon found him and Virginia crossing the station 
platform to board the express for New York. So quietly had their plans 
been made that not a friend was at the train to bid them farewell -- 
the scientist felt that he could not bear the strain of attempting
explanations at this time.

But there were those there who recognized them, and one especially who
noted the lithe, trim figure and beautiful face of Virginia Maxon 
though he did not know even the name of their possessor. It was a tall 
well built young man who nudged one of his younger companions as the 
girl crossed the platform to enter her Pullman.

"I say, Dexter," he exclaimed, "who is that beauty?"

The one addressed turned in the direction indicated by his friend.

"By jove!" he exclaimed. "Why it's Virginia Maxon and the professor, 
her father. Now where do you suppose they're going?"

"I don't know--now," replied the first speaker, Townsend J. Harper, 
Jr., in a half whisper, "but I'll bet you a new car that I find out."

A week later, with failing health and shattered nerves, Professor 
Maxon sailed with his daughter for a long ocean voyage, which he hoped 
would aid him in rapid recuperation, and permit him to forget the 
nightmare memory of those three horrible days and nights in his 
workshop.

He believed that he had reached an unalterable decision never again 
to meddle with the mighty, awe inspiring secrets of creation; but 
with returning health and balance he found himself viewing his recent 
triumph with feelings of renewed hope and anticipation.

The morbid fears superinduced by the shock following the sudden demise 
of the first creature of his experiments had given place to a growing 
desire to further prosecute his labors until enduring success had 
crowned his efforts with an achievement which he might exhibit with 
pride to the scientific world.

His recent disastrous success had convinced him that neither Ithaca 
nor any other abode of civilization was a safe place to continue his 
experiments, but it was not until their cruising had brought them among 
the multitudinous islands of the East Indies that the plan occurred to 
him that he finally adopted -- a plan the outcome of which could he 
then have foreseen would have sent him scurrying to the safety of his 
own country with the daughter who was to bear the full brunt of the
horrors it entailed.

They were steaming up the China Sea when the idea first suggested 
itself, and as he sat idly during the long, hot days the thought grew 
upon him, expanding into a thousand wonderful possibilities, until it 
became crystalized into what was a little short of an obsession.

The result was that at Manila, much to Virginia's surprise, he 
announced the abandonment of the balance of their purposed voyage, 
taking immediate return passage to Singapore. His daughter did not 
question him as to the cause of this change in plans, for since
those three days that her father had kept himself locked in his 
workroom at home the girl had noticed a subtle change in her parent 
-- a marked disinclination to share with her his every confidence as 
had been his custom since the death of her mother.

While it grieved her immeasurably she was both too proud and too hurt
to sue for a reestablishment of the old relations. On all other topics 
than his scientific work their interests were as mutual as formerly, 
but by what seemed a manner of tacit agreement this subject was taboo. 
And so it was that they came to Singapore without the girl having the 
slightest conception of her father's plans.

Here they spent nearly a month, during which time Professor Maxon was 
daily engaged in interviewing officials, English residents and a motley 
horde of Malays and Chinamen.

Virginia met socially several of the men with whom her father was 
engaged but it was only at the last moment that one of them let drop a 
hint of the purpose of the month's activity. When Virginia was present 
the conversation seemed always deftly guided from the subject of her 
father's immediate future, and she was not long in discerning that it 
was in no sense through accident that this was true. Thereafter her 
wounded pride made easy the task of those who seemed combined to keep 
her in ignorance.

It was a Dr. von Horn, who had been oftenest with her father, who gave 
her the first intimation of what was forthcoming. Afterward, in 
recollecting the conversation, it seemed to Virginia that the young 
man had been directed to break the news to her, that her father might
be spared the ordeal. It was evident then that he expected opposition, 
but the girl was too loyal to let von Horn know if she felt other than 
in harmony with the proposal, and too proud to evince by surprise the 
fact that she was not wholly conversant with its every detail.

"You're glad to be leaving Singapore so soon?" he had asked, although he
knew that she had not been advised that an early departure was planned.

"I am rather looking forward to it," replied Virginia.

"And to a protracted residence on one of the Pamarung Islands?" continued 
von Horn.

"Why not?" was her rather non-committal reply, though she had not the 
remotest idea of their location.

Von Horn admired her nerve though he rather wished that she would ask
some questions -- it was difficult making progress in this way. How 
could he explain the plans when she evinced not the slightest sign that 
she was not already entirely conversant with them?

"We doubt if the work will be completed under two or three years," 
answered the doctor. "That will be a long time in which to be isolated
upon a savage little speck of land off the larger but no less savage 
Borneo. Do you think that your bravery is equal to the demands that 
will be made upon it?"

Virginia laughed, nor was there the slightest tremor in its note.

"I am equal to whatever fate my father is equal to," she said, "nor do
I think that a life upon one of these beautiful little islands would be
much of a hardship -- certainly not if it will help to promote the 
success of his scientific experiments."

She used the last words on a chance that she might have hit upon the 
true reason for the contemplated isolation from civilization. They had 
served their purpose too in deceiving von Horn who was now half convinced 
that Professor Maxon must have divulged more of their plans to his 
daughter than he had led the medical man to believe. Perceiving her 
advantage from the expression on the young man's face, Virginia followed 
it up in an endeavor to elicit the details.

The result of her effort was the knowledge that on the second day they
were to sail for the Pamarung Islands upon a small schooner which her 
father had purchased, with a crew of Malays and lascars, and von Horn, 
who had served in the American navy, in command. The precise point of 
destination was still undecided -- the plan being to search out a 
suitable location upon one of the many little islets which dot the 
western shore of the Macassar Strait.

Of the many men Virginia had met during the month at Singapore von Horn
had been by far the most interesting and companionable. Such time as he
could find from the many duties which had devolved upon him in the matter
of obtaining and outfitting the schooner, and signing her two mates and 
crew of fifteen, had been spent with his employer's daughter.

The girl was rather glad that he was to be a member of their little 
company, for she had found him a much travelled man and an interesting 
talker with none of the, to her, disgusting artificialities of the
professional ladies' man. He talked to her as he might have talked to 
a man, of the things that interest intelligent people regardless of sex.

There was never any suggestion of familiarity in his manner; nor in his
choice of topics did he ever ignore the fact that she was a young girl. 
She had felt entirely at ease in his society from the first evening that
she had met him, and their acquaintance had grown to a very sensible 
friendship by the time of the departure of the Ithaca -- the rechristened
schooner which was to carry them away to an unguessed fate.

The voyage from Singapore to the Islands was without incident. 
Virginia took a keen delight in watching the Malays and lascars at 
their work, telling von Horn that she had to draw upon her imagination 
but little to picture herself a captive upon a pirate ship -- the half
naked men, the gaudy headdress, the earrings, and the fierce countenances
of many of the crew furnishing only too realistically the necessary 
savage setting.

A week spent among the Pamarung Islands disclosed no suitable site for 
the professor's camp, nor was it until they had cruised up the coast 
several miles north of the equator and Cape Santang that they found a 
tiny island a few miles off the coast opposite the mouth of a small river
-- an island which fulfilled in every detail their requirements.

It was uninhabited, fertile and possessed a clear, sweet brook which 
had its source in a cold spring in the higher land at the island's center. 
Here it was that the Ithaca came to anchor in a little harbor, while her 
crew under von Horn, and the Malay first mate, Bududreen, accompanied 
Professor Maxon in search of a suitable location for a permanent camp.

The cook, a harmless old Chinaman, and Virginia were left in sole 
possession of the Ithaca.

Two hours after the departure of the men into the jungle Virginia 
heard the fall of axes on timber and knew that the site of her future 
home had been chosen and the work of clearing begun. She sat musing on 
the strange freak which had prompted her father to bury them in this 
savage corner of the globe; and as she pondered there came a wistful 
expression to her eyes, and an unwonted sadness drooped the corners of 
her mouth.

Of a sudden she realized how wide had become the gulf between them now. 
So imperceptibly had it grown since those three horrid days in Ithaca 
just prior to their departure for what was to have been but a few months'
cruise that she had not until now comprehended that the old relations of 
open, good-fellowship had gone, possibly forever.

Had she needed proof of the truth of her sad discovery it had been enough
to point to the single fact that her father had brought her here to this
little island without making the slightest attempt to explain the nature 
of his expedition. She had gleaned enough from von Horn to understand 
that some important scientific experiments were to be undertaken; but 
what their nature she could not imagine, for she had not the slightest 
conception of the success that had crowned her father's last experiment 
at Ithaca, although she had for years known of his keen interest in the 
subject.

The girl became aware also of other subtle changes in her father. He 
had long since ceased to be the jovial, carefree companion who had 
shared with her her every girlish joy and sorrow and in whom she had 
confided both the trivial and momentous secrets of her childhood. He 
had become not exactly morose, but rather moody and absorbed, so that 
she had of late never found an opportunity for the cozy chats that had
formerly meant so much to them both. There had been too, recently, a 
strange lack of consideration for herself that had wounded her more than 
she had imagined. Today there had been a glaring example of it in his 
having left her alone upon the boat without a single European companion
-- something that he would never have thought of doing a few months before.

As she sat speculating on the strange change which had come over her 
father her eyes had wandered aimlessly along the harbor's entrance; the 
low reef that protected it from the sea, and the point of land to the
south, that projected far out into the strait like a gigantic index finger
pointing toward the mainland, the foliage covered heights of which were 
just visible above the western horizon.

Presently her attention was arrested by a tossing speck far out upon the 
rolling bosom of the strait. For some time the girl watched the object 
until at length it resolved itself into a boat moving head on toward the
island. Later she saw that it was long and low, propelled by a single sail 
and many oars, and that it carried quite a company.

Thinking it but a native trading boat, so many of which ply the southern 
seas, Virginia viewed its approach with but idle curiosity. When it had 
come to within half a mile of the anchorage of the Ithaca, and was about 
to enter the mouth of the harbor Sing Lee's eyes chanced to fall upon it. 
On the instant the old Chinaman was electrified into sudden and astounding
action.

"Klick!  Klick!" he cried, running toward Virginia. "Go b'low, klick."

"Why should I go below, Sing?" queried the girl, amazed by the demeanor 
of the cook.

"Klick!  Klick!" he urged grasping her by the arm -- half leading, half 
dragging her toward the companion-way. "Plilates!  Mlalay plilates --
Dyak plilates."

"Pirates!" gasped Virginia. "Oh Sing, what can we do?"

"You go b'low. Mebbyso Sing flighten 'em. Shoot cannon. Bling help. 
Maxon come klick. Bling men. Chase'm 'way," explained the Chinaman. 
"But plilates see 'em pletty white girl," he shrugged his shoulders
and shook his head dubiously, "then old Sing no can flighten 'em 'way."

The girl shuddered, and crouching close behind Sing hurried below. A 
moment later she heard the boom of the old brass six pounder which for 
many years had graced the Ithaca's stern. In the bow Professor Maxon
had mounted a modern machine gun, but this was quite beyond Sing's 
simple gunnery. The Chinaman had not taken the time to sight the ancient 
weapon carefully, but a gleeful smile lit his wrinkled, yellow face as he
saw the splash of the ball where it struck the water almost at the side 
of the prahu.

Sing realized that the boat might contain friendly natives, but he had 
cruised these waters too many years to take chances. Better kill a hundred 
friends, he thought, than be captured by a single pirate.

At the shot the prahu slowed up, and a volley of musketry from her crew 
satisfied Sing that he had made no mistake in classifying her. Her fire 
fell short as did the ball from the small cannon mounted in her bow.

Virginia was watching the prahu from one of the cabin ports. She saw the 
momentary hesitation and confusion which followed Sing's first shot, and 
then to her dismay she saw the rowers bend to their oars again and the 
prahu move swiftly in the direction of the Ithaca.

It was apparent that the pirates had perceived the almost defenseless 
condition of the schooner. In a few minutes they would be swarming the deck, 
for poor old Sing would be entirely helpless to repel them. If Dr. von Horn 
were only there, thought the distracted girl. With the machine gun alone he 
might keep them off.

At the thought of the machine gun a sudden resolve gripped her. Why not 
man it herself?  Von Horn had explained its mechanism to her in detail, 
and on one occasion had allowed her to operate it on the voyage from 
Singapore. With the thought came action. Running to the magazine she 
snatched up a feed-belt, and in another moment was on deck beside the 
astonished Sing.

The pirates were skimming rapidly across the smooth waters of the harbor, 
answering Sing's harmless shots with yells of derision and wild, savage 
war cries. There were, perhaps, fifty Dyaks and Malays -- fierce, barbaric
men; mostly naked to the waist, or with war-coats of brilliant colors. The 
savage headdress of the Dyaks, the long, narrow, decorated shields, the
flashing blades of parang and kris sent a shudder through the girl, so 
close they seemed beneath the schooner's side.

"What do?  What do?" cried Sing in consternation. "Go b'low. Klick!" But 
before he had finished his exhortation Virginia was racing toward the bow 
where the machine gun was mounted. Tearing the cover from it she swung the 
muzzle toward the pirate prahu, which by now was nearly within range above 
the vessel's side -- a moment more and she would be too close to use the
weapon upon the pirates.

Virginia was quick to perceive the necessity for haste, while the pirates 
at the same instant realized the menace of the new danger which confronted 
them. A score of muskets belched forth their missiles at the fearless girl 
behind the scant shield of the machine gun. Leaden pellets rained heavily 
upon her protection, or whizzed threateningly about her head -- and then 
she got the gun into action.

At the rate of fifty a minute, a stream of projectiles tore into the bow 
of the prahu when suddenly a richly garbed Malay in the stern rose to his 
feet waving a white cloth upon the point of his kris. It was the Rajah Muda 
Saffir -- he had seen the girl's face and at the sight of it the blood lust 
in his breast had been supplanted by another.

At sight of the emblem of peace Virginia ceased firing. She saw the tall 
Malay issue a few commands, the oarsmen bent to their work, the prahu came 
about, making off toward the harbor's entrance. At the same moment there 
was a shot from the shore followed by loud yelling, and the girl turned to 
see her father and von Horn pulling rapidly toward the Ithaca.
