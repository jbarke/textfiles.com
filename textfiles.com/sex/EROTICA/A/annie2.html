         I  don't  know about for all of you down in the  chilly  Bay Area, 
    but  up here the weather was really nice Saturday.  So nice, in   fact,
    that   it  encouraged me to engage  in  another  of  my exploits.   Not
    that I planned it, of course. I  packed a lunch and headed for the river,
         the  afternoon  being just  too hot, even for mint juleps in the back
    yard.  There was   some barbecued  chicken  and a couple of  Calistogas
    in  the fridge,  so  I threw  them into the cooler with some ice, pulled
    on a  swimsuit   and covered it with some other  clothes,  grabbed  a
    towel and a book,  and left. I   have this favorite unnamed spot by the
         river,  sandy  but  not too  populated.   You have to know the river
    roads to find  it  and   I guess  that even though it's a pretty good 
    beach  not  too many  people know about it.  That's an advantage of being 
    a local.  When I parked  I knew  by  the  absence of other cars that there
    were  very   few  other people there, and when I walked onto the beach  I
    found one couple near the  trail  back to the cars, another  couple far
    down the  beach,  and this one guy about halfway down.  I'm not terribly 
    shy, and decided  to have a bit of fun. He  saw  me coming and I saw him
         looking me over.   I'm  not  Fawn Hall,  but  I  get my share of  
    admiring  looks;  this  was  apparently one of them.  As I walked towards
    the guy I could  see he  was   worthy of  some admiring looks himself:
    he  was  young (maybe   23--I  never did  find  out), trim, nicely groomed
    and  not too   hairy.   He  also wasn't  pasty white--you know, the  way  
    some guys  get  who spend  too much time at a VDT.  So I  just  set  my
    things down sort of near  him, but  not right next to him, just  to see
    how he'd react.  I stood  with my back to him as I pulled  off my shirt, 
    being sure to stretch my back as  I did so.  I also made sure  that  as I
    spread the towel out I  was facing  him,  so  that when  I bent down he
    could see my tits (not  the swimsuit  doesn't gap THAT much, but he had a 
    nice view of what  little there  is!).  I pretended to accidentally pull
    down my swimsuit  bottom a  bit as I  pulled  off my shorts.  Then I laid
    down and reached   for the sunscreen. The   sunscreen   makes   me
         glisten,  though   I   was   already beginning  to  do so just from
    the sun's heat.  I spread  it  all over, being  sure to let him see how I 
    tucked it under my top   and  massaged my inner thighs.  I lifted first
    one leg and  then  the other (a little Jane Fonda workout, here!) as I did
    the backs  of the calves. Just   as I was finishing my front, my audience
         got  up  from  his chair   and walked over--a bit stiffly, as he was
    trying  to  hide   a nice  erection.   His buns hardly wiggled as  he
    walked--a  real  nice ass.  He offered to put the oil on my back (men are
    SO  predictible!). Well, I thought I'd let that one linger a bit  as I 
    opened a  Calistoga and gave it a nice suck, and then found  out his name
    was Bill, that he had  gone  to  the same JC as I, and that he was  indeed
    a  few  years younger  than  me.   I handed him the  oil and  flipped
    over  onto  my stomach.  I reached behind and undid the knot at my back
    and asked  him to go ahead. Bill   has done this before--he warmed the oil
         in his  hands,  and started  rubbing  it  in smoothly at first, then
    later   kneading  the muscles.   I  always  appreciate experienced men!
    He  stared   at  the center  of my back, worked his way up to my
    shoulders,  and then  came down my sides.  I let him feel a bit of my
    breasts, but just the sides. He worked down to the waistline and then
    started on my thighs.  He  was giving me nice, long, slippery strokes,  as
    he  worked  his hand up  to my butt.  He paid a lot  of  attention there,
    sliding his hand  beneath the  suit more than once and  more than  a
    little  distance.   He  was enjoying  this as  much  as  I, though it WAS
    getting to be a bit  more than I'd first planned. We  had been talking but 
         soon that degenerated into a   series  of murmurs  as I just relaxed
    in the warm sun massaged  by  warm,  knowing hands with warm oil.  I would
    have fallen asleep except that my butt is a very sensual place and I think
    Bill was beginning to  discover  that. Eventually, I reached for my
    waistband and simply lifted my butt enough to push the bottom of my suit
    down a bit; he  pulled it the rest of the way  off  and  finished
    massaging and oiling all of my bottom.   After awhile he sat across the
    top of my things and began  to  work  my  back again, but this time very
    clearly he was reaching around to my front to my nipples.   Then  he
    simply lay down on my back and I could feel his very hard cock nestled
    into my crack; it felt fine! I  opened my eyes and the other couples were
         not watching   us  at all.   I had Bill push up for a moment and I
    rolled over  to  take  him into  my arms.  He kissed me gently and I used
    my lips to nibble   his. My legs were together but his cock felt just
    fine, resting  just  above my clit, very clearly a situation we both
    wanted to do something about. My  shirt comes to just below my butt, so I
         had him reach  for  it and we took a walk over to a nearby grove of
    willows.  You can  imagine the rest.  After we were through, it was
    getting  to  be late afternoon and  I let him go--I don't think he ever 
    learned my name, and  I  don't know  his  last name.  But that beach'll
    never be the   same,  and  the willows are now named the "Mr.  Bill  
    Memorial Grove"--at least by me.
