                 <<<<<Orphan Annie's 7th Adventure>>>>>

         While   Euclid   found   that a triangle was one   of   the   most
    stable  geometric  structures,  it certainly isn't  in  human  affairs. 
    Well,  I knew that going into one, but the pleasures of the  flesh  are
    too   great for a mere mortal such as myself.  I knew  that I  couldn't 
    keep both Larry and Norman. They  are  both  great, and in different ways.
    Norman  is  pure, sizzling,   unadulterated   breathtaking   sex;  I
    can't   take   him anywhere  except my bedroom, but why would I want to?   
    We  don't  talk much,  but we communicate nonetheless, orally and  
    otherwise. Larry  is unsure  of  himself, and as a rough tradesman not
    someone  my   father would  immediately like (well, they met at  a
    barbecue  one   weekend, and it took a while for even some  conversation
    to take  place, but at least he wasn't thrown out), but he's  gentle and
    generous and we have great  verbal communication.   Larry  is really
    possessive, a  problem even in a monogamous  relationship, and Norman
    doesn't care so long  as he doesn't get AIDS. When   I   raped   Larry in
    the bathtub   the   other   afternoon, though,  and  he came back for
    more as soon as he was toweled   off,  I had   a sense that things were
    going to change.  He  had   never  shown that much self-confidence, and
    all of a sudden he was  less a  toy  and more  a real man to deal with.
    Uh-oh...I wasn't  going to be  able  to hold on to all of this. I guess 
    Norman felt it, too, because the next night, after a  slow start  he
    got really frenzied, pumping away  in  me  almost frantically for  an hour
    before we both collapsed in a  pile  of musky  sheets  and slippery
    bodies.  God, he was like  candy...you just can't give up that kind of 
    attention! Then,   the   next  weekend, Larry took me out  for   dinner
    and dancing.   He  was  well dressed, he found a  fabulous
    restaurant,  we danced  and swirled around the dance floor until the place
    closed,  and then we went home and literally fucked until the  sun  rose.
    He ate me until I was thrashing all over the bed, then he'd slide right  
    in   and excite  me  some more.  After he'd come, I  used  my lips  to  
    get  him excited  again and we went at it all over. I  had hickeys  on my
    neck, my breasts, my thighs and my butt,  and  the windows  were well
    steamed in the morning.  I had to take  a  nap for  the better part of
    Saturday just  to  recover.  I thought  I'd sent Larry home, but  when  I  
    awoke about 4:00 he was peeking  into the bedroom with some fresh coffee,
    and almost before I  finished that  we  were  at it again.  You've got   
    to understand  what  a gorgeous  man  Larry is, and just how the  contrast
    between  his coarse exterior and his caring behavior is so exciting:  I
    really  can't keep my hands off him.  He even looks better in the  robe he
    gave  me  than I do!  And I just love sliding my hand   up   inside that
    robe  because I find such a wonderful cock  to  play  with!  Then he took
    me out to dinner again and all he did was play  with his   food while his
    hand was playing between my legs.   He  kept calling me  "the most  
    exciting  person  he'd met," and I had to  lie  about  Norman  to return 
    the compliment.  Which of these guys do  I keep around? I  HAD to get
    Larry out by Sunday morning, because Norman was  due Sunday
    afternoon.  We went out for a hillside  picnic,  and after  the wine  was
    gone the local eagles had a terrific view  of human   anatomy until  the
    sun went down.  He didn't  say  anyting about  the  hickeys, but  he  must
    have seen them!  Then we sort  of curled   up   in   the blanket and dozed
    on the  hillside  until  we awoke,  shivering,  about midnight.   I gave
    him a hand job on  the drive back to my  place,  but insisted he leave so
    I could rest for Monday's  work.  I was reaching a point where I couldn't
    keep  up the pace of keeping two guys up. So you see the dilemma. What do
    I do?
