      Dr. Stevens listened intently as Jan described her first visit to
      the club. "Did you join?", she asked. "Yes, I really liked most of
      the people I met there, and somehow, I felt like I belonged." Dr.
      Stevens moved to sit beside Jan on the couch and took her hand.
      "Jan, I've been starting to feel that you may be moving too fast
      into this second life and not exercising enough caution. When you
      mentioned the cameras and video tape, I got a chill down my spine
      because I've heard of people being blackmailed with something like
      that. And, you really don't know that much about Dan. How can you
      be so sure you won't get hurt?" Jan placed her other hand on top of
      the doctor's and looked into her eyes.  "Have you ever had the
      feeling that there is a part of you that has always been there, but
      never come to the surface?" Dr. Stevens nodded and Jan continued,
      "Well, I've had that feeling for a long time and when I got
      involved with Dan, I began to realize what that hidden part was. I
      am a very sexual creature. I'm finding that I love everything about
      my body and the bodies of other people and I've never been as happy
      or free as when I'm having sex. My parents were very strict and I
      went to a catholic school, so when I went to college, and later in
      the business world, I accepted that sex was for procreation and
      should only be pleasurable with a husband. Unfortunately, most of
      my experiences with men tended to reinforce that belief and I
      always felt guilty when sex felt good. Besides, the men I made love
      with seemed more interested in relieving an itch than making me
      feel good. I think if I had had a more "normal" sex life when I was
      younger, I might not have this tremendous need that has built up
      inside me for a long time with no relief, but it's there and I have
      to find a way to deal with it."

      "The club made me afraid in the same way that Dan does, sometimes,
      but I found that I liked the fear. It's partly a fear of being hurt
      or discovered, but mostly, it's a fear of the unknown. I really
      believe Dan has everything under control and won't let me get hurt.
      I don't know why I feel that way, but I do and getting the video
      tape seemed to make me believe it even more. When I first suspected
      that they were taping me with Kevin, I made up my mind that I will
      NOT be coerced or blackmailed.  They can show it on 'Sixty
      Minutes', if they want, and I'll find a way to deal with it in my
      real world. I really do believe it is the only copy, and I'm toying
      with the idea of giving a copy to Dan and, maybe, Denise with the
      understanding that it will be for their enjoyment only." Dr.
      Stevens looked concerned and suggested that Jan not do that until
      she had thought it through completely and they had discussed it
      together. Jan agreed, and went on, "You know, I've watched that
      tape at least a dozen times since I got back from that trip and I'm
      just beginning to be able to relate to that incredibly sexy woman
      on the screen being me. The first few times, it was like watching
      someone else in a porno movie even though I could clearly remember
      it happening."

      Dr. Stevens was quiet for a few moments, then said, "Would you be
      willing to let me see the tape?" She wasn't certain that her
      curiosity was entirely professional in nature, but she found
      herself wanting desperately to see what Jan had described and,
      perhaps it would help her to provide better guidance to her
      patient. Jan nodded and said, "I have it in my purse. Would it be
      O.K. if I watch it with you?" The doctor took the cassette and
      inserted it in the VCR that was built in to the bookshelves that
      made up one entire wall of her office. She pressed the play button
      and took a seat in a large, soft chair where she could see both the
      TV screen and Jan, sitting on the couch. She wanted to take note of
      Jan's reactions to what she was watching.

      The tape began with Jan being helped to the stage by Kathy. ("My
      God,", she thought, "she really is small. She almost looks like a
      miniature woman beside Jan." As the video progressed, it became
      obvious that the club had at least four different cameras to cover
      the low platform from several different angles. From Jan's
      description of the club and what she could see on the screen, they
      were most likely remotely controlled for pan, tilt and zoom and
      whoever was doing the controlling appeared to be an expert at
      covering live action. All in all, the tape was very professionally
      done. As Kevin was placing the head of his huge cock against Jan's
      lips, Dr. Stevens shifted her eyes to watch her patient.  Jan's
      eyes were glued to the screen and her hand was resting lightly in
      her lap. Her legs were pressed tightly together and squeezing very
      slightly. It was clear that Jan was aroused by what she was
      watching and the doctor encouraged her to describe her feelings as
      the tape progressed. Jan talked very openly about how Kevin had
      felt and tasted in her mouth and later, the sensations she felt as
      his giant member was entering her body. Despite all her efforts at
      maintaining a professional aloofness, Dr. Stevens felt the sexual
      stirings within her vagina and knew that her own fluids were
      starting to flow as she listened to her patient and alternately
      watched her patient and the highly charged action on the screen.

      As Jan talked and watched, she stole quick glances at the doctor
      and began to sense that she was also becoming very aroused. She
      started making her descriptions and comments more vivid and new
      that she was intentionally trying to turn Dr. Stevens on. She
      wanted her therapist to understand exactly how she felt as she
      performed sexually before all those strangers and she slid her hand
      under the waistband of her skirt and into the bikini panties she
      wore underneath. She knew that the doctor could see what she was
      doing, even in the low light of the office, but didn't care. Yes,
      she did care. She wanted to be watched as she masturbated.

      Dr. Stevens knew that she should stop the tape and get both Jan and
      herself back under control. Her patient was masturbating feverishly
      in her office and, worse still, the doctor wanted desperately to do
      the same thing. Dr. Stevens had only been in practice for five
      years and had never had a situation like this arise before. She
      had, of course, been warned many times during her training that it
      was her responsibility to maintain control of the session at all
      times, but what could it really hurt if Jan brought herself to
      orgasm while watching herself on the screen? "If only I weren't so
      damned turned on myself.." she thought.

      When the video Kevin pulled out and moved up to position himself
      over the waiting mouth of the video Jan, the live Jan cried out,
      "Oh, Yes!  He's going to come in my mouth!", and her real mouth
      opened wide in imitation of the one she was watching, as her
      fingers dug deeply between her sopping lips and her thumb pressed
      hard against her clit.  Jan's orgasm began for real just as Kevin's
      did on the tape.

      The semen falling like big, white raindrops onto Jan's beautiful
      face and parted lips was more than the doctor could take. She
      turned to see Jan's mouth wide open as if wanting to feel and taste
      it yet again and Jan's hand was working feverishly under her skirt
      as she reached her climax. Dr. Stevens needed an orgasm as badly as
      she ever had in her life, but she also needed to keep that fact
      hidden from her patient.  Somehow, she managed to keep her
      composure and suggested that Jan might want to go to the ladie's
      room in the outer office and "freshen up".  When Jan had left the
      room, the doctor went to the small private bathroom beside her
      office and locked the door. She quickly lowered her panty hose and
      panties and sat on the chair at the make up table. She raised her
      skirt to her waist and drove two fingers into herself. She was
      coming almost immediately and her fluids were running down the
      crack of her bottom to pool on the velvet below her. She fingered
      her clit harder than she could ever remember and found herself
      enjoying the slight pain she was causing from such rough handling
      of her most sensitive spot.

      When Dr. Stevens came back into the room, Jan was standing quietly,
      looking out the window. The doctor walked up behind her and put her
      arms around Jan's small waist. She leaned forward and placed a
      light kiss on the back of Jan's neck, pushing the soft, shiny hair
      aside with her face. "Jan,", she said quietly, "I'm going to refer
      you to Dr. Kelly. I think you'll really like him." Jan didn't move.
      The arms around her waist felt very good, and she had half expected
      Dr. Stevens to drop her case after what had just happened. The
      doctor continued, "I'm afraid I can't maintain my objectivity where
      you're concerned and I think it would be better if you see another
      therapist for awhile. Besides, the next time you go to Boston...
      I'm going with you. If you and Dan will have me."
