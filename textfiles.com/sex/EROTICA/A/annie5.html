         Even   though  we'd  stopped going out a year ago,  I  was   still 
    curious  about Norman.  He'd always been intriguing, he'd  always  made me
    laugh and smile, and I remember his being  dynamite  in bed.   But he'd 
    gotten serious about another girl (god, don't  you hate to compete with  
    18-year  olds? and I'm not sure she was  even 18)   and   without much ado 
    I'd just made myself scarce.   No  big scene  a year ago,  but I wasn't
    going to be merely  an  irregular Thursday-night diversion for him! But
    then   just   last  week someone  had   mentioned   him   in passing,
    in  the  single mode.  It wasn't "Norman  and  Chris,"   but merely   
    "Norman."  So I called, and knew as soon as  he  answered  I'd got myself 
    wrapped up again.  I loved just hearing his voice.  He   was delighted,
    even over the phone he made me smile,  and  we eagerly set a date  for  a
    movie Friday evening.  I would come over to   his   place, and  I knew
    there was already  a  good  chance  I wouldn't leave  until Saturday or 
    even Sunday. When  I arrived I presented him with a bottle of wine and  a
    very sensual  kiss.   I'd dressed in tight jeans and a thin   crepe  
    blouse, and   I  could feel his hands  warmly  embrace  me  right through
    the fabric.  We decided to start the wine--so  it  could breathe for
    later, of course--before leaving for the theater.   I stood  right next to
    him as he maneuvered the cork out,  so  he'd catch the perfume I'd worn
    for him;  I  know  I was close enough  to feel  the  warmth   of  his
    body without   even  touching  him.   We toasted  our good fortune and
    then left  hand-in-hand; during  the drive  over  I kept my hand on his
    leg and he was  most  terribly distracted.   You  give men just the hint
    of sex and they  go  to pieces on you! In   the theater I pulled his hand
    over to my leg as soon  as  the lights dimmed.  I held it down firmly
    as he massaged my thigh and  then slid up to cup my mound.  He gently
    rubbed me so that  I could tell  he hadn't  forgotten a thing.  My legs 
    were spread wide apart and  I  held his  wrist in close to me.  Pretty
    soon my breath was  getting  shorter and shorter and I had to make him
    stop.   My sigh of relief was  almost audible, for I was about to come
    right there! Then   it  was  my turn.  I reached down between  his   legs
    and grabbed  his balls.  I could slide my hand up his shaft and  back
    down again,  and even through the heavy fabric of his jeans  could feel
    him thick  and throbbing.  I kept that up for a half hour  or so,  and
    had to quit when my arm was so tired from the  contorted position  that
    my only  other choice would have been to drop  down on  my  knees  between
    his legs; it was a hard (!) choice, but  the theater was too crowded to do
    something obvious like that. So  I  squeezed  his thigh, let go, and sat
    back  in  the   chair, resting   while trying to catch up on the plot
    I'd been  ignoring.   He put  his arm around my shoulder just as the  
    movie  began  to shift  to the  romantic  part of the  adventure.
    Inspiration  to  Norman!    He let   his  hand drop down my front  and
    squeezed  my breast.    I  had only  a slender, thin bra on beneath the
    crepe  so that  I  could  feel every  one  of his fingers caress me, and
    in  a very  few  moments  my nipples were quite erect.  He  reached  over
    and  undid a button on  my blouse  and  slipped his hand inside.   I was
    so hot  I  was  surprised there  wasn't  steam  coming out, and the warmth
    of   his   hand  just reflected  right  back  onto  my  chest.  Audacious
    as   ever,  Norman then proceeded not merely to  cup  my breast,  but
    there in the theater to  slide  his hand  beneath  the bra  cup and
    directly  stimulate  my nipple.   I  was about  to  come right there, once
    again!   The  sexual tension was so high I had to grab the armrests to
    keep from jumping him there in the seat! Thankfully,   the  movie  soon
    ended and we  emerged   into   some surprisingly   cold   night  air.
    Well, the whole   world   was   cold compared   to   us!  We went to get a
    bite to eat, where   he   and   I played   a   marvelous   game of
    footsie.  The wine   didn't   at   all measure  up, though, so we rushed 
    home to where we had  something worth our attention(!). Norman   lit   a
    fire  while I freshened up  (and   put   in   a diaphragm!).    When
    I   returned to the living room   he   had   two glasses,   the  wine  and
    some pillows all arranged in  front  of   the fireplace.    I bent over
    and kissed him as he handed me a  glass,  and rubbed  his  chest.   He
    grabbed my calf in reply while  I  sipped  the wine.  What a smooth,
    sensual bouquet! A good  beginning  to this  part of the evening, for
    sure! Then  we  stretched  out before the fire and  kissed.   Gently  at
    first,  our  lips just sort of nibbling on each other.   Then  we  drew
    each other closer and really explored mouths.  He  put  his glass  down
    and  began again on my blouse's buttons, and I likewise started  in  on 
    his  shirt.   I soon was rubbing my hands  all  over his  hairy  chest,
    kissing his neck and tongueing his ears, and  he was  fumbling with the
    front closure of my bra.  Once he  had  it open  I rolled him onto  his
    back, pushed his hands away  from  my tits and rubbed my chest directly
    over  his.  I was so horny  now!  With  his arms pinned to the floor  I
    wrapped  my legs  around  his waist and squeezed there, then ground  my
    pelvis against his.   He closed his eyes and just took it like a man! When
    I  let  his hands go they went for my butt  and  began   to massage
    it firmly, exploring all of it from my waist to the  tops of my thighs,
    and as he held me down I could feel him growing and  throbbing beneath
    his zipper.  I lifted up and began to pull  his  zipper  down, soon
    exposing his shorts and then opening his  pants all the way so  I could
    reach inside.  What a find! He  was moist, and warm, and full of fun
    there!  I soon  moved  my mouth's attentions there and took him fully 
    between my  lips.  He   was tasty,  too.  I started sucking, kissing,  and
    squeezing him, all  the while  my hand cupping and massaging his balls.
    In a very short  while his hips were moving up and down in rhythm  with my
    mouth  and I  knew he  wouldn't  be  long  in  coming.   When   the  
    spurts   came  I  was swallowing it all and kept sucking even  after he
    had collapsed. After  a  brief recovery, he pulled me up to  face  him.
    I first maneuvered  his pants the rest of the way off, and then  he
    began   to work  on my belt.  He had this great smile on  his  face that
    made  me let  him do to me whatever he wanted!  Soon, my jeans joined  his
    in  a pile and his face was down between my legs,  his hands  on my
    breasts. His tongue explored all the  crevices  and folds of my labia and
    soon I was rubbing my mound up and down his face, getting him thoroughly
    wet. In a last spasm I collapsed in a  series  of  yells  and was
    twitching on  the  floor,  like  an epileptic, until I just fell asleep. I
    think  he  did too, because the next thing I  remember  is  his
    gently shaking me, murmuring with half-closed eyes.  Whatever  he said, it
    had  something to do with going to bed and I was  all   too  ready.
    Somehow, with unsteady legs, I managed to stand up and we both sort  of
    wobbled down the hallway, leaning on each other.  We didn't  get out of 
    bed  for  thirty-six hours, though we must  have slept   no  more  than
    five.  For that night and the next  full  day the  only sunlight we saw
    was  what came in through  the  curtains blowing at the  open  windows.
    Well,  Norman  did get up to get  the champagne and bagels we  had  for
    breakfast,  and  I  did have to  pay attention   to  the  contraceptive
    supply.   We  would doze and  awake only  to  make   love.   Then  we'd 
    decide we  were  too  musky  (an oxymoron?) and go take a shower, where
    I'd  climb  up on him in the hot  stream and we'd screw away,  my  legs
    around  his waist and  my arms around his neck as as I pumped away  and he
    swayed in the hot water.   Then we'd towel each other off and  climb back 
    into  bed where he'd eat me again.  I wholly lost track  of  how many  
    times  I  came,   well  over  a   hundred.    I   was   at   once
    exhausted   and  exhilerated.  After I went home, Sunday was  shot,  of
    course,   but  I   was  exhausted for good causes:   I  think  I'm  now 
    bowlegged   for  life, and I think Norman has sworn  off  inexperienced
    girls!
