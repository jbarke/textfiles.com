
         This last weekend was a surprise for me, the first time I'd "done" a 
    married man (though god knows I've looked at 'em in the past!).  When it
    was  all  through, though, he could say he'd  still  been  (mostly) 
    faithful. I threw this small  party for a dozen or so friends Friday
         night, sort of a kickoff for the July 4 weekend.  John came up from
    The  City, on his way to the Sierras for a  weekend's  backpacking,  
    something his wife never really liked.  I think she went home to mother,
    or somesuch. Anyhow, the party went late, and when it was breaking up,
    John asked if he could stay on the  sleeper  in the living  room,  rather
    than try to drive on at night to a dark campground.  I said sure. John and
         I made up the  sleeper  and then I went to take a shower. When  I
    came out, in my robe, he was in the bed and  reading.   I said goodnight
    and turned to head for my bedroom  when  he made  some  funny comment
    about what he'd just read.  I laughed too, and went over to see more.   
    When he showed me the article,  I recognized it and  we started talking.
    I was soon  sitting  on the side of his bed,  listening  and watching.
    As I looked I realized what a real cutie he really was--all that dark
    hair,  the  strong  shoulders  (all I could see of his body), and those
    great teeth that showed  when he smiled.   I got  to thinking what a great
    find his wife had.   Then,  somehow,  he made some gesture and his hand
    ended up on my leg--and I really don't know how to explain this,  but my 
    hand suddenly went there on top of his.   He looked at me funny and gave
    me a gentle  squeeze as he tried to pull  away,  which I returned.  He
    smiled and said, "Ann, I can't.  Really."   You know, The Speech. I  just 
         murmured and bent down to kiss him.  Of course,  the  robe fell  open
    and of course his hand went inside it  and   about  halfway through  the
    kiss I knew we were in trouble.  We sort  of  stayed  that way  for a
    while and then I moved my legs up onto  the bed.   His  hand went  from
    my side to my back, and his other  hand went  to  my  butt, stroking  it
    gently.  I pulled the  covers  from under  me and  ran  my hand down his
    chest and across his  stomach.  He was so strong, too!  I nibbled on his
    ear and he just moaned. Well, this was fun and all that, but he was right,
         he WAS (I mean, "is") married, after all.  His hand was now on  my
    breast and  I   was going to have to decide something, soon.   I  made  a
    decision, sat up, and then swung my leg over to straddle him.  He looked
    disappointed  as I sat up, and then delighted as I moved my leg across his
    body.  He was on his back and I was sitting across his thighs. Now he
         could put both hands on my breasts.   He was so strong, and yet so
    gentle!   His hands just sort of came up my rib cage and stroked my
    breasts from underneath to the nipple.   I found I could sort of sag into
    his palms.   I grabbed his cock  and began to stroke it,  and then every
    once in a while,  needing a little oral contact,  I bent down and kissed
    him or let him suck my tits.  I was warm all over and every part of him I
    touched was warm, too. Then  his  hand went around  and began to play with
         my butt again. I lifted myself up and moved up until I was directly
    above  his  cock. I was really  wet by now and could feel my cum running
    out.   I  set my pussy on his  balls and just stroked it up his shaft.
    Up,  lift, back down,  again and again.   His cock  was  really  getting
    wet!   He just moaned,  and then moved his hand to grab both my cheeks.
    He  tried to move  me just that bit  farther up to  where he  could slide
    in,  and I really  wanted to,  but I knew things would be  different
    tomorrow and next week.  "No," I  said, "but wait."  He was getting even
    longer and really throbbing! His hand began alternating from my breasts to
         my butt.   His  legs went up and then down, and I could feel his
    pelvis thrusting in time to my stroking.   His eyes were  squeezed shut
    and that great smile of his was all across his face! I could feel myself
         throbbing,  too.   I was working up a sweat (I almost laughed out
    loud when I realized I'd now need  ANOTHER  shower!) but he felt so good  
    beneath me I couldn't stop.   My clit was  bumping the top of his cock 
    every time I slid up there and I was just about out of control
    until---THERE!---and there again!---and again!--I was coming and the
    contractions just wouldn't stop.  I collapsed onto him, with my legs 
    wrapped around his thighs and my feet tucked between  his  calves, my
    breasts  crushed  against his chest,  and his hands stroking my butt and
    my back.   I really don't think he came,  but he was looking really good! 

    Besides, it was too wet down there to really tell in  the half light. I
         would have loved to stay all night. But, like I said,  he  was
    married and it just wouldn't do to have  SLEPT  with  him.  After a few 
    moments I tore myself away and staggered back to  my bed,   firmly  and
    quietly shutting the door behind me (no ideas, John!). I was  asleep
         almost  before I was in my own bed  (cold sheets!). When  I  awoke,
    it  was  late Sunday morning and John was gone.   He'd stripped  the bed 
    and left a pile of musky-smelling sheets.   I'm  sure he had to hike a few 
    extra miles to get me out of his system!
