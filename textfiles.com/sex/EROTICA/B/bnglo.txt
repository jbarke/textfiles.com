           The Bungalow
 
Caitlin Walsh curled up on the sofa with
a Harlequin romance novel. As she sipped
a cup of hot cocoa, another roar of
lightening pierced the night. She jumped
and got upto look out the huge Bay
window in her living room. The 30-miles-
per-hour wind made the trees sway
ominously. She closed the drapes and
hugged her German Sheperd, Max. "At
least I have you tokeep me company,
Max."
 
Caitlin lived in a rural town where
everyone knew each other, but were
separated by farms and long country
roads. Her nearest neighbor was a
mile away! She usually didn't mind,
mile away! She usually didn't mind;
She loved the little one-floor bungalow
and surrounding wooded area. But when
and surrounding wooded area. But she
couldn't help feeling a little afraid
and isolated at a time like this.
 
She went to the kitchen to get some
popcorn, when she heard a light tapping
on her front door. She looked out the
window to find a rain-soaked man in his
late twenties. Looking past the man, she
noticed a blue pickup truck whose wheels
were entrenched in the mud. She sighed.
There wasn't a garage for another 5
miles, and no one could walk that far in
this deluge. She let him in.
 
"I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but
my car...." She smiled. "Yes, I can see
my car...." She smiled. "Yes, I can see you're a bit stuck. The neais 5 miles away, and the phone lines
are down, dur to the storm."
 
"Great." He muttered. "Well, thanks, for
being so kind, Miss....."
 
"Walsh. Please, call me Caitlin."
 
"Walsh. Please, call me Caitlin. Where
are you going?"
 
"To go sleep in my truck."
 
"You do, and you'll catch pneumonia.
Come on in. My bungalow is small, but
homey. Would you like some cocoa? You
must be chilled!"
 
"Oh, no, please don't go to any trouble.
.."
 
"No trouble at all! I'm on my second cup
and was just going to pop some popcorn!
Why don't you use this popper in the
fireplace while I get your cocoa?"
 
He grinned broadly. "Thanks, Caitlin!
By the way, I'm Ian."
 
"Nice to meet you Ian," she smiled
back shyly. "I'll be back in a second."
 
When Caitlin returned with the cocoa,
Ian had a large batch of freshly-popped
popcorn ready. They chatted while they
ate, mostly about the little town,
which Ian had just moved to.
 
"You know, Caitlin, I'm really so
grateful you let me in. Most people
wouldn't have allowed total stranger
wouldn't have allowed a total stranger
into their homes."
 
She chuckled. "Well, you look like a
nice enough guy."
 
"Thanks. But looks can be deceiving. I
could be an axe murderer, or a rapist."
 
Caitlin's mouth went dry. A sickening
lump formed in her stomach. Reading this
reaction in her face, Ian quickly said,
Please, don't be afraid, I am neither of
these things. I'm not a burgler, or
killer or anything! I'm sorry if I've
frightened you! Maybe I'd better leave..
..."
 
As quickly as her fear came, it left.
"Nonsense," she replied. "Please, feel
free to stay."
 
He smiled again. "Thanks, Cait, really.
But there is one thing I think you must
know about me...."
 
"Uh oh, here it comes, " she moaned
silently. "He's going to hit on me."
 
Ian cleared his throat. I have this one
overwhelming compulsion -- I love to
tickle women. I love to make them weak
with laughter, utterly helpless."
 
Caitlin stood up and started to walk
away but Ian grabbed her arm."Cait, I
will NOT hurt you! I'm just going to
tickle you senseless!"
 
With that, he threw her down on the rug
and started digging his fingers into her
sides. Caitlin let loose with a howling
laugh that made Ian very excited. The
harder Cait laughed,the harder and
faster he tickled her. He looked into
her teary eyes and smiled wickedly.
"Would you like me to stop?"
 
"YES!" she screamed.
 
"Okay. I will. But not until you tell
me every ticklish spot on your body!"
 
Her eyes widened in horror. "Never!"
she screamed. "Okay, it's your suffering
not mine!" Ina fat and furious motion
he tickled Caitlin all over her body,
her sides, stomach, underarms, hips,
thighs, knees, and feet. She was so
hoarse from laughing/screaming she
couldn't even beg him to stop.
 
"Will you tell me?" He cooed. She nodded
"Will you tell me?" He cooed. She noddedweakly.
 
"Good. Get some rest. When you awaken,
be prepared to have every inch of
be prepared to have every inch of you
tickled!"
 
 
 
                  THE END
