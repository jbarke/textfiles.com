    This is the thirteenth in a series of Willy Tamarack adventures.  In this 
adventure Willy gets an unexpected invitation back to the cabin but instead of 
Connie is met by Rich, Connie's husband.  All hell breaks loose - some of you 
will say Willy deserved it.  Is it the end of Willy Tamarack ?  I'm still 
stoked but I'm tired of writing.  All the stories are written to stand alone 
but are so much more fun to read together.  As always e-mail your comments to 
the usual.

                             *** CHAPTER ONE ***

    I just departed Dagget VOR at 10,500 feet enroute to the cabin again.  
There were supposed to be thunderstorms later this afternoon but this morning, 
I guess it was really early afternoon, it was beautiful.  Lots of puffy white 
cumulus clouds lining up along the mountains and totally clear out over the 
desert.  My long ago, high school girl friend, Connie, and her husband own 
this cabin up in Big Bear.  Last weekend I had flown some of my friends to the 
cabin from Las Vegas and we had partied hardy for a night.  Jesus, what a 
night.  Fucking, sucking, three sums, four sums, girls with girls.  And while 
I didn't see any boys getting it on; I probably came the closest when Joyce 
fucked my ass with this long skinny dildo while I was fucking Connie.  Shit, 
it took me the better part of the week to recover and get my shit together.  
Thursday, after my morning run, I found a message on the answering machine.  
It was Connie; inviting me to share the weekend with her at the cabin.  I 
wonder who else was going to be there ??

    Funny, she didn't ask me to bring anyone.  She's really a party girl and I 
guess, I'm getting that way too.  Shit, seems like the only time I get laid is 
when I'm with a group and everyone is getting some.  Mind you; I'm not 
bitching.  Since I moved to Las Vegas a couple of years ago, I have struck up 
friendships with a lot of ladies both old and young.  Not bad for a "pushing 
50's" guy.  I guess you could say that the sun has really been shi
