FOREWORD: This story was inspired by the work of deirdre, whose
postings to a.s.s. I have been enjoying. In the foreword to one
of her stories, she mentioned that she doesn't generally enjoy
writing from the dominant's point of view. I immediately started
speculating on what one of her stories would look like if it were
written from that perspective. This tale is the result of that
speculation.
=================================================================

     "And don't forget," Monica said as I left her office with a
stack of documents, "I need that $100 back by Monday."
     "I haven't forgotten," I told her, closing the door behind
me. Oh god... where was I going to get the money? Not that I was
worried about it. Well, not really. Monica was a little bit
intimidating, a tall, heavy black woman. She was one of the
senior secretaries at the law firm. Even had her own office.
     And she was a lesbian.
     That frightened me a bit. Not regarding the money I owed her
or anything, but... well, I'd never had any inclinations in that
direction, but you couldn't help but wonder sometimes...
      I guess she just made me uncomfortable.

     The office floor was quiet, as you'd expect on a Friday
evening. Just the cleaning man and a couple of secretaries
unlucky enough to be working for Heather Thompson. Not that she
was mean or anything. A little snotty, maybe, but not mean. At
least no meaner than any other boss. She was a bit strange,
though. In the months I'd worked for her, I'd often caught her
staring at me; when she thought I wasn't looking.
     I was her secretary.
     She had a trial set to start on Monday, and there was plenty
of work to be done. Her, Monica and I would be at the office all
weekend. Monica had bitched about it - something about previous
plans, and how Heather had ruined some plans last month - but
Heather had insisted.
      I don't think they got along very well.

     Heather glanced up at me as I entered the office with the
documents. She looked tired and frustrated. Things weren't going
well with the trial prep, I guess.
     "Just put those down over there." She gestured to a clear
spot on her desk. I did so. She really *did* look tired. It had
been a hard week.
     "Want some coffee?" I asked.
     She looked at me for a moment. I was struck by the intensity
of her gaze as her blue eyes captured my face. Then she looked
away and shook herself. "Sure," she answered, getting up. "You
have some too."
     She had a coffee machine in her office - all the lawyers
did. We stood side by side, pouring coffee and milk... I turned
to my right to get the sugar just as she turned left. Suddenly,
we were standing, face to face, inches from each other. Her eyes
caught mine and...
      I don't know why. Maybe it's because I had been thinking
about Monica and her... her orientation. Maybe it was the smell
of Heather's perfume... her wide, blue eyes gazing at me...
looking, what, frightened? Hell... maybe just because it was the
end of the week and I was tired; and I hadn't seen my boyfriend
since last Saturday.
     Whatever the reason, I slowly leaned forward and brought my
mouth to hers. She let out a little sigh and parted her lips. Our
faces met. I slipped my tongue out and into her mouth...
playing... teasing... When we finally parted, she just stood
there: eyes closed, lips parted... breathing heavily. And I
thought: 'she's really turned on; she *likes* this!' For me, the
kiss had been interesting - not unpleasant, but not particularly
arousing. As I said, I'm not gay.
      But Heather...
     I had to do it.
      I had to see how far this would go.
     "Take off your clothes," I whispered. She opened her eyes,
suddenly frightened, but I soothed her by running a hand through
her thick, shoulder length blonde hair and then down along her
neck. Trembling in my hands, she slipped out of her shoes. I
watched in disbelief as she undid her blouse, slid her skirt down
to her ankles and stepped free of it. Her stockings quickly
joined the skirt on the floor. She moaned softly as I ran my
hands down to her chest and unclipped her bra. Her breasts, small
but firm, popped free as I pulled the garment away. Her nipples
were rock hard. Finally, she was standing there in nothing but
her panties.
     I stared at her as she stood trembling, eyes downcast.
     "Do you want me to... touch you?" I asked. She looked
startled for a moment, like a deer caught in headlights, but
quickly nodded her head, not meeting my eyes.
      It felt almost like a dream as I took her hand and led her
to a chair. I sat and pulled her down over my knees where she
knelt, panting while I ran my hands up and down her body. I put
my hand under her panties and slipped a finger into her pussy; it
was dripping. She was really into this. I played with it a bit,
teasing her clit as she moaned and squirmed on my lap. "Please,"
she whispered, leaning further forward across my lap. "Oh
please..."
     How far could I go?
     On impulse, I took my fingers away from her pussy and
slipped one of them into her anus. She stiffened on my lap, but
didn't pull away. I added a second and then a third. Her moans
got louder as I began sliding them in and out... in and out... I
reached my other hand around and - I don't know why I did this;
it just seemed to be called for - delivered a hard slap to her
rear end. She cried out and started wriggling again.
      "Quiet," I hissed, delivering another blow. She stopped
moaning, but was unable to prevent her rear end from writhing as
I continued to spank it. I felt her tears dripping onto my leg,
but there was no denying her excitement. It just built and built
until finally, she experienced what looked like a devastating
orgasm right there on my lap. Her legs kicked back and flailed
wildly; she whined and moaned as my fingers ran in and out of her
now-stretched anal passage in a blur.

     Eventually, she calmed down.
     I pushed her off my lap and she fell onto her knees. I
looked down at her as she knelt there: blonde hair askew; tears
running down her face as she stared up at me with those wide,
blue eyes.
      Waiting.
     For what?
     I wished that there was something she could do for me.
Sexually, I mean. Despite the activities of the last few minutes,
I felt nothing.
      If only...
     Of course.
     I got up and walked over to the pile of her clothing.
     "Stand," I ordered. She stood, still watching silently.
      I picked up her stockings and blouse. Walking around behind
her, I slipped the blouse over her face and tied it in a
blindfold over her eyes. She gasped and reached up to remove it,
but I just pulled her hand down. "Don't," I whispered, reaching
around from behind and teasing her nipples. She sighed and melted
back into me as I slid my hand down her front and to her pussy.
      It was wet again. I played with it for a moment before
pulling her panties up tightly around her waist.
     I saw tears flow out from under the blindfold as I gently
pulled her hands behind her and bound them with her stockings.
When I stepped away, she just stood in position, blind and
helpless. Still crying, but her nipples were rock hard. Now I
just needed one more thing... The bra. I picked it up, draped it
around her neck and tied it off.
      A perfect leash.
      Grabbing hold of the long end, I tugged gently on the bra.
She moaned in fear, but followed as I pulled her to the door and
out into the hallway.
     "Don't," she whispered.
     But I did.

     We must have presented a strange sight: a lawyer - naked
except for her soaked panties - being pulled along by her
secretary, but there was no one there to see it. Except the
cleaning man. I winked at him as we went by. He stared, but
didn't say anything.

     I pushed Monica's door open without knocking. She looked up,
obviously ready to complain about the intrusion, but fell silent
when she saw Heather. I pulled my captive in with the bra leash
and presented her to Monica, taking a small bow.
     My compliments.
     By now, Heather was more than a little frightened. Her head
twisted back and forth as she struggled to see from behind the
blindfold. While Monica watched, I walked up to the lawyer and,
placing a hand behind her head, drew her forward for a long,
passionate kiss. By the time we broke apart, she was panting, her
quick, shallow breaths causing her breasts to jiggle in front of
her. Monica got the idea. She had joined me in front of the
blindfolded Heather and was playing with the woman's breasts.
Heather's breathing grew heavier.
     I pulled away and walked to the door as Monica smiled and
nodded at me. By the time I got to the door, the large black
woman had moved around behind Heather and was running her hand up
and down the woman's bottom.
     I couldn't resist: "She likes it up the ass," I said as I
pulled open the door.
     Heather gasped.
      "Nooooo."
     Yes. As I watched, Monica slipped a long, black finger up
the woman's rear end while another hand snaked out around the
front to keep the wriggling woman from pulling away. I heard
sobbing as I closed the door, but I knew it wouldn't last long.
And if it did... well, they had the whole weekend to work out the
details of their new relationship.
     And me? Well, I would rest easier knowing that my debt to
Monica had been paid in full.

                             THE END
