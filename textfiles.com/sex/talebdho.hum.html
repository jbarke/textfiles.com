  TALE OF A BORED HOUSEWIFE

  CHAPTER I (PT 1)

  It was a cool gray, November afternoon.  I was walking down the quiet upper
middle class, suburban street I lived on, on the way to Gloria's house.  It was
fairly windy, a gust whipped up and I had to reach down to hold my skirt.  I
suppose my modesty wasn't really in jeopardy but the skirt was considerably
shorter than what I was accustomed to wearing.

  Gloria had asked me to assist her with a party she was throwing for Dave's
boss.  He had just started a new job she really wanted to impress.  Part of his
new responsibilities included entertaining customers.  She was going to hire
several college girls to serve food and drinks but she suggested that maybe I
would want to help and in return she would forget the $65.00 I had borrowed
earlier that month.  I readily agreed, the party sounded like fun.  Gloria
thought about renting maids uniforms for us but decided against it, she then
asked us to all wear matching skirts and blouses.  She had called me earlier in
the week and told me that mine was almost ready, I had gone over to her place
to try the skirt on.  I was uncomfortable with how short it was but she laughed
it off, reminding me that I was about 20 years behind the times.  I didn't want
to appear too prudish, I didn't know any of these people and wouldn't be the
only one dressed like this, besides it was no worse than what many other women
were wearing these days; so I agreed to wear it.  I had to admit the outfit
didn't look too bad on me, a red and black checked skirt, white blouse, red
scarf, black high heels and suntan panty hose.	It may have looked all right
but it wasn't designed to protect me from the November gusts I shivered and
hurried along the sidewalk.

  Gloria met me at the door, she laughed and asked me if it was going to snow.
We stood on the porch and discussed the overcast weather for a moment, until
she noticed me shivering.  We stepped inside to begin preparations for the
evening.  Gloria was busy on the phone so I did most of the straightening up,
setting up the buffet, etc.  About 5:00, a pretty young girl came to the door
wearing the same outfit I was in.  We introduced each other; Paula was to help
me serve.  She seemed nice, pert, maybe a little impertinent but friendly
enough and I had to admit in that outfit with her figure, she looked smashing.
She told me she was a 19 year old student at a nearby JC.  I said goodbye to
Pete and Chris, Gloria's kids, 16 and 14 respectively.  They were going to
their own party that night, so they wouldn't be disturbed by ours.  They were
actually the reason for my friendship with Gloria; Chris was my daughter
karen's best friend.  And Pete was Karen's boyfriend.  He had always scared me,
I thought he might be too "mature" for her, but what could I do?

  Gloria came down about 7:30.	Dave had just gotten home and the guests had
just started arriving.	Mostly couples, mid twenties to early forties, they
were quite well dressed.  There were about 25 people in all, including Paula
and I.	I was introduced to most of the guests and was flattered by the
interest all took in me although a little uncomfortable.  The women were less
friendly, maybe even condescending.  It seems that Gloria had mentioned
something about me to most of them.  I was involved in putting away the guests'
coats and serving drinks.  At one point I walked by the kitchen and heard
Gloria on the phone.  Something caught my attention and I froze, listening to
the conversation......"36 years old, married, 3 kids, 5'6", 120lbs, green eyes,
brown hair, has no idea what's going on.  This bitch has never even thought
about anyone other than her husband."

  At that the party on the other end must have said something, for Gloria was
silent.  I was dumbfounded, she couldn't be talking about me??

  About this time she looked up and noticed me standing there.	She looked
startled but recovered well, "what are you doing?  Dammit Joan this is personal
I'd appreciate it if"........I turned and went back into the living room; the
incident seemed strange but I really didn't think it was important, I could
confront her later.  I didn't think she really had been talking about me.

  I went into the living room, it was quite large, with a fireplace in the
center.  They had used furniture to divide it into two "rooms"; a family room
and a more formal living room.	I went to the buffet table set up in the
ajoining dining room and started helping Paula serve.  Occasionally one of us
would carry around a tray of drinks.  I began to feel slightly uncomfortable,
out of place.  There was an air of excitement in the room but whenever I got
near enough to a group to hear or join in the conversation it seemed to die;
sudden pauses, pregnant silences etc.  This happened several times and I was
wondering what was going on.  Paula seemed to fit right in though.  When she
brought around a tray I saw her laughing with the main group.  One of the men
put his arm around in a manner that suggested they had not just met.  Several
of them including Paula looked over in my direction as if appraising me, then
Paula returned and offered to relieve me for a while.  This went on until about
9:30.

  Dave came over and took my arm, "there's someone I want you to meet".  He
introduced me to Craig, his boss, and Phil, Gloria's brother.  Both men seemed
seriously interested in my life, my family, job etc.  and were really probing
me for details.  This seemed strange too but a welcome relief from the
alienation I had been feeling up to this point.  I took a glass of wine and
began to loosen up.

  About half an hour later Gloria gathered all the guests back into the living
room, saying "it's time folks".  Everyone seemed quite excited at this and I
wondered, "what in the world".........I was on my 2nd glass of wine, (I never
drink), and slightly lightheaded.  Phil gently took it out of my hands, took my
arm firmly and guided me to the living room.  The chairs and couches had been
rearranged in a semi circle in front of the fireplace.	In the center a long
low coffee table had been placed.  The guests were seated or standing around
the table.  Phil guided me to the front, I was confused but held his arm.
Gloria stood in front of the table facing everyone.

  "This is something I have been looking forward to for a while.  Joan has been
interested in Indian rights for some time.  She doesn't know it but tonight she
is going to help collect money for the cause".  There was a general outbreak of
laughter at that.  I decided that I would prefer to be standing in the back and
started to move but found my arms suddenly grabbed.  I froze.  "Bring her up
here", Gloria commanded.  Paula and Jan (a friend of mine from Garden Club)
each took one arm and pulled me up on the coffee table, I resisted but not too
hard, not knowing what was coming.  I was turned so that I faced the group, my
arms still held, and my hair wrapped around Paula's hand, she forced my head so
I had to face the group.

  Gloria smiled at me and told me to relax, "this won't be too bad we're just
going to auction off some clothing".  The room erupted with laughter.  I was
numb, too shocked to scream.  Gloria stood next to the table "what do I hear
for her scarf?"; some one offered $1.00, another $2.00, the bidding went up to
$5.00.	At that time Gloria accepted the bid, and reached for me, ripping the
scarf from around my neck.  I screamed, a hand was clamped around my face.  The
scarf was forced down my throat and with my arms held I couldn't get it out.
People started to sit down, they all appeared to know what was going to happen.
"Next up, her blouse", There was some cursory bidding, Gloria backed up close
to the table, I saw the opportunity and tried to kick her.  That was a mistake.
Phil and Craig grabbed both legs.  They each took hold of an ankle.  In
addition they rubbed their hands up and down my thighs and up under my skirt,
much to the amusement of the other guests.  I was sobbing in my humiliation but
there was no escape.

  After a little more bidding my blouse was removed.  Phil won the bidding and
took it off himself.  They bent me over a little so that his face was level
with mine.  He reached out and ripped my blouse down the front, he jerked my
arms out, I tried to cover up but Jan twisted my arm until I gagged.  I relaxed
and they straightened me back up.  I was held there, up on the table with just
my bra on.  I went blank for a moment, the only other man who had ever seen me
like this was Tom.........  I never in my worst dreams imagined this could ever
happen.  Paula fingered a gold chain I was wearing.  It had a diamond pendant.
Tom had given it to me for our 12th wedding anniversary.  It was sold for
$5.00.	It was ripped off my neck, the chain breaking at the clasp, and ripping
my neck.  Gloria told Paula to hold up my ring finger so my wedding band could
be examined, "she won't be needing that tonight".  It went for a few dollars.
I was still kind of in shock, I was sobbing but was still unbelieving.	These
things really don't happen.  Again Gloria stepped up.  She reached out and
snapped the strap on my bra.  "What do I hear for this fine Maiden Form
Brassiere?"....  The other guests all laughed at her sarcasm, they talked among
themselves but most of the attention was riveted on me.  The bidding went on.
My bra was sold for $20.00.  Gloria didn't make any move to remove it though, I
was shaking like a leaf, what next?  "Whoever correctly guesses what size this
item of clothing is shall have the privilege of removing it, however an
incorrect guess costs $5.00".  She reached back and looked at the tag and
laughed, "not bad, who's your plastic surgeon?".  I was turned and poked by
several guys "so they could have a fightin' chance of guessing right".  Several
people tried guessing, on the third guess Steve's wife Marie said 36D, and
Gloria smiled...."we have a winner".  Marie "graciously allowed" Steve to
remove the bra.  He took his time.  He poked, rubbed and fondled me to the
delight of the crowd for about five minutes.  I had lost control by then,
sobbing hysterically.  Finally He removed it, and his hands.

  I had noticed earlier that several people had brought camera's with them, now
it appeared that everyone had.	I was turned and twisted to pose for these
people, my hair practically ripped out of my head to force me to look into the
cameras.  Paula reached down, still holding one arm and ripped my skirt up to
my waist, flashbulbs popped.  They didn't bother with the formality of
auctioning my skirt, it disappeared in a frenzy.  I passed out.

  When I awoke I was spreadeagled on my back on the coffee table, feet tied,
each to a leg, arms held back over my head by Paula and Jan was surrounded by
the guests, Gloria was slapping my face.  When I opened my eyes she smiled
"she's ready now" Craig was standing at my feet.  His wife ritualistically
unbuttoned his trousers and pulled them down.  She caressed his penis but it
was throbbing, he didn't need much help.  When he entered me it was rough.  I
screamed into the gag and everyone broke into hysterical laughter.  Craig even
stopped and smiled, but not for long.  He had intercourse with me more roughly
than I ever imagined possible.	Each stroke seemed to burn itself into my
insides.  I looked up once into his eyes and saw a terrible fury there.  When
he was done He pulled out and stood up, He moved to the head of the table and
stood over me his penis dripping into my face.	He put one foot on the table
next to my face and motioned Paula and Jan to pose on either side of him like a
champion race car driver being congratulated after a victory while his wife
took several snapshots.  They also each put a leg up on the table, their
nyloned legs flanking him as Marion took the shots.  I tried to cover up, Jan
grabbed an arm and I was jerked back into a helpless position.	After Craig,
the other men began taking turns on me.  They blanked into one another I was
only semi-aware when one was done and another started.

  Again I blacked out.	I was thinking about Tom and Karen my 14 year old, (and
Pete's girlfriend).  I imagined myself with them on the beach during our last
vacation.  I was warm and comfortable.	In my dream I was warm and comfortable,
I thought I saw my son coming towards me with a cold coke.  He threatened to
pour it on me.

  I awoke with a start to look up into Steve's face as he rubbed a cold bottle
of beer against my crotch.  Things were quieter, the lights had been turned off
in this end of the room, there were several candles lit.  I was no longer
gagged nor held down.  Steve helped untie my ankles and his wife Marie gently
guided me to a couch.  I noticed that most of the guests were gone, there were
several couples sitting at the other end of the room talking with Gloria and
Dave but they paid us no attention.  Marie helped me gather my shoes, panty
hose, bra and what was left of my blouse.  My panties were nowhere to be found.
I put on my panty hose and with Marie's help my shoes and skirt.  Steve was
still holding my blouse and bra.  Gloria noticed something and walked down to
our end of the room.  "Steve let me help you with that stuff, It's not fit for
Joan to wear anymore so let's just chuck it".  With that Steve frowned but
handed her the clothing and she tossed it into the fireplace where it
disappearred in a temporary resurgence of the dying fire.

  Marie and Steve both looked a little sympathetic, they sat on the couch on
either side of me.  They were both quite gentle, and after the last hours I
clung to that.	The room was warm but I was still shaking uncontrollably.
Steve held me to stop my shaking.  For the first time I could remember I
stopped sobbing.  I didn't resist when Steve cupped one breast.  He was gentle
and I felt a little safer being held.  Marie spoke up.	"I saved your wedding
ring for you, want it back?  Of course, ....  listen though Steve has a fantasy
about this, would you be willing to help him live it?  It's a lot easier than
what you've already been through tonight".  I nodded agreement silently.  I
knew I had no choice and I was more comfortable here than I would have been if
Gloria noticed me again.  And they were so kind, I wanted to preserve that
desparately.

  Steve reached for my hand and held it while Marie slipped the ring on my ring
fingerÆêzSteve unzipped his pants and motioned for me to pull his member out.
I hesitated but when Marie started to move I reached for it.  I took it out, It
was hard almost immediately.  Marie guided me to the floor in front of Steve
where I knelt.	She pushed my Face down into his crotch and I understood I was
to take it in my mouth.  I gagged but did it.  After a few moments she pulled
my head back and told me that if I wanted to I could just use my hand but I
would have to let him come in my face.	Dumbly I cooperated.  I was in a kind
of shock.  Everytime I tried to use my right hand she stopped me, I was to only
use my left.  When he came he spurted in my face and on my hand which went up
to protect my eyes.  He came a lot, it was warm and felt smooth against my
skin.

  Flashbulbs popped.  I looked left and there were Paula and Gloria both
recording this moment for posterity.  Me topless, on my knees, Steve's cock in
my face and cum dripping off my face and hand (later I was to learn that it was
dripping off my ring, that was the object of the exercise).  When Steve
finished cumming, Marie wiped his cock off with my other hand and replaced it
in his pants.  They both got up as if I wasn't even there and joined the other
group.	I heard a long burst of hysterical laughter.  Gloria spoke up as they
left.  "Get on your feet and bring us some wine, and see if anyone wants any
dessert." I complied, it didn't seem like there was anything else to do at the
time.

  It was about 2:00 AM by then.  I served dessert and a little wine to the
remaining guests.  I was directed to again remove my skirt and kneel on the
floor under the lamp where they could all see me, until I was needed.  I
complied.  I tried not to look into anyones' eyes, I was sobbing again but
afraid of making too much noise.  At one point Gloria got up and threw my skirt
into the fire, she also grabbed the arm that I was using to cover my breasts
and jerked away.  "Don't you dare cover up".  After that they mostly ignored me
in the conversation but would occasionally give me a look of disgust to insure
I was aware of my condition.

  For awhile I knelt there, leaning back fully exposing my breasts to avoid
Gloria's wrath.  I was thinking back through my entire relationship with Gloria
and Dave.  I had never seen anything remotely comparing to their treatment of
me tonight.  I had felt that Gloria was occasionally unnecessarily snippish
with me, even rude, but she had always seemed to be a fairly reliable friend.
I had confided in her about marital problems etc.  and she in me.  Her cruelty
shocked me as did her blatant enjoyment of my subjugation.  I thought about
Jan.  She had always been a good friend.  She was what men call a doll, small,
excellent figure, pretty face, dark complexion, attracted men like flies but
seemed to ignore them.

  Tonight she was acting extremely provocative, enjoying egging the men on, and
directing their energies towards me.  She also enjoyed my subjugation.	I never
even imagined that she could act like this.

  About 3:30 Paula got up to leave and Gloria told me to help her with her
coat.  Standing there in the hallway Paula smiled and cruelly told me that "I
have really enjoyed the evening, haven't you?" She laughed and told me that she
had made a deal with Gloria, and I was the deal.  I would be hearing from her
later in the week, and if I valued my family I would cooperate.  She pulled my
necklace out of her pocket and told me she would get it fixed.	Maybe I could
borrow it sometime....with that she stepped out the door and I was left alone
in the hallway.  Dave came out and guided me to the basement, he pointed to a
pile of blankets and said Gloria would be down in the morning.	I heard that
door shut and the lock click into place.  Alone in the dark, I sobbed myself
through the night but didn't sleep.  I relived the experience countless times.
Was it real?  Why?  Why?  Why?	How could I face the people I knew.  How could
I face Gloria and Dave, and the others I knew I might see again?

  About 12 hours later The door opened and the bright light caused me to squint
in pain.  Gloria came down carrying some clothing which she dumped at my feet.
"Get up!!  Joan I'm not going to waste time with unnecessary threats.  Suffice
to say that I have affidavits from everyone who was here last night that you
got drunk and made a fool of yourself.	You made passes at every man and when
they were done you were begging for more.  I have pictures that would ruin your
marriage for ever.  And finally if you don't want me to include Karen in our
next Soiree, you will do as you are told.  I do require you to sign two papers
and then I am going to let you go.  I know you won't be stupid enough to fight
this but just in case."

  I looked at the papers.  One said something to the effect that I had agreed
to "sell my body" for $65.00.  I agreed to serve as the entertainment at an
"adult" party with the understanding that providing sexual favors would be part
of the deal.  She had me write my age, name, and measurements on the form in my
own handwriting.  She also had me write that I would gladly perform fellatio
and have intercourse with whosoever desired at this party.  And that I
understood that although such an agreement was illegal it would suffice to
prove the voluntariness of any sexual activety.  I managed to maintain my
composure and although I shook, I wrote what she wanted.  After I had written
what she had originally ordered, she smiled and said let's improve this, "write
that you are married and you know Tom your husband would die if he knew what
you had done, so you asked your husband to leave you alone for the weekend."
Finally she had me write a note to Tom on the back of the contract.  "Tom I
decided to see what the rest of the world was like.  I enjoyed what the 11 guys
at that party did to me.  Ask Gloria for some snapshots." I complied.  Gloria
told me she was sure that she would never have to use this paper.

  The other form was a model release which covered the entire night.  It
specifically mentioned that the photos were nude, I had posed voluntarily and
that I assigned to Gloria the rights to do what she desired with them including
publication.  The total helplessness of the situation got to me.  I broke into
tears.	"Joan if you don't sign this in about 3 seconds you will lose the
chance and I will have to protect myself in a less genteel fashion".  I wasn't
sure what she meant but decided that I had nothing to lose by signing the
forms.	I did and she left.  Strangely she looked at me with almost
friendliness in her eyes and said gently, "Joan things have changed, but you're
going to be all right.	If you continue to do what you're told, we will take
care of you." As she climbed the stairs out of the basement she left the
basement door open and opened the back door of her home.  I was looking
directly outside.

  I stepped out of the light and dressed.  She had chosen the clothes to
humiliate me.  There was no bra or panties, the sweater was her daughters, and
about 3 sizes too small.  The shoes were mine, the pantyhose mine (it had been
washed) but the skirt was again Chris'.  In addition to being too tight it was
so short I was afraid to walk, if I took too long a step I felt I would be
exposing myself to the world.  But I did put it on and stepped out the door to
freedom.

  Walking down the street to my home I reflected on the evening.  And Gloria's
cryptic final remarks, she couldn't think she could do this to me again?  I
looked down at what I was wearing and realized that she might be able to do
what she wanted.  That was a chilling thought.	I knew I could never go to the
police.  There was a real possibility that even if they believed my story, that
Gloria could indeed ruin my life and my families'.  I passed by a moving van,
people were just moving into the home.	Three guys stood on the steps.	I heard
a loud whistle, and another.  Realizing they were for me I smiled involuntarily
but stepped up my pace.  I felt embarrassed but flattered.  I looked up into
the November sky.  It was the deepest blue and the brightest sunlight that I
had seen in a long time................
