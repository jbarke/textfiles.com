     Ok, so ya say ya wanna learn how to pick combination locks...This text
file should help you. As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help
you.  First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch
on the horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
To free this wedge, you must(must is a word used to much) you usually(that
sounds much better) have to turn the lock to the desired combination and the
pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the lock open.  I will now
tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock without having to waste
all that time turning the combination (this also helps when ya don't know the
combination to begin with).  First of all, ya need to find a hairpin. What's a
hairpin?  Well, just ask your mom.  She will have one.  If she asks what its
for, say ya gotta hold something together...  If she says use a rubberband or
use a paperclip, tell her to fuck off and die and then go to the store and rip
off a box of 50 or so.  Ok, enough stalling (yea, i was stalling).  Once you
have your hair pin (make sure its metal), take the ridged side and break it 
off
right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight side.  The curved 
part
t can now be used as a handle.  Now, using a file, file down the other end
until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many hairpins and file them
so they are of different thicknesses so you can pick various locks.  Some 
locks
are so cheap that ya don't even have ta file!  But most are not.  Ok, now you
have a lock pick.  Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how ya use it.
You look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens 
from,
, take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the horseshoe-
shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.  Now, put pressure on the
handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the crack) and pull the lock up 
and
down. The lock will then open because the pick separated the wedge and the
notch allowing us thieves to open it.  Don't say bullshit until you've tried 
it.
because i have gotten lots of beer money from doin' this to fellow students'
gym lockers.  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never
picked a Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but
if anyone does it, let me know how long it took.  Also, the Master lock casing
is very tight so ya can't get the pick in.  So, if you're locking something
valuable up, use a Master, cuz at least ya know I won't be picking it and I'm
sure there aren't that many that could.  And when i say pick, i don't mean
lighting a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock 
without
t using force, making a substitute key, etc...  If any of you believe that 
this
information is not sufficient for picking an American lock, or any other kind
besides Master, leave me a message at /\/\etalland 1 (503) 538-0761.
     This concludes my text file on picking combination locks.  My next text
file will probably be "Picking key locks".  See ya later.

THIS TUTORIAL WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO
"PICK" A PIN TUMBLER LOCK.  USE OF THIS
MATERIAL IS FOR LOCKSMITHS ONLY, ANY
USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR ILLEGAL
PURPOSES IS FORBIDDEN AND AGAINST THE
LAW. (AS LONG AS WE ARE AT IT, DO YOU
WANT TO BUY SOME LAND IN FLORIDA?)

IN ORDER TO PICK A PIN TUMBLER LOCK,
YOU WILL REQUIRE FOUR ITEMS: A LOCK,
YOU, A PICK, AND A TENSION WRENCH. YOU
CAN USSUALLY GET THESE AT A LOCKSMITH
STORE, IF YOU CAN NOT FIND ONE NEAR YOU
THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS AT THE END OF
THE ARTICLE THAT YOU CAN ORDER THEM
FROM. HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A PICK
AND A TENSION WRENCH:

     ________/   !________
      PICK         TENSION WRENCH

MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THE NEED FOR THE
PICK, BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WRENCH
IS FOR.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITH-
OUT IT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK
A LOCK.

IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK, WE MUST COUNT
UPON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LOCK.
BEFORE WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACTUALLY PICK
THE LOCK, WE WILL LOOK AT THE PARTS OF
IT AND HOW THE IMPERFECTION PART FITS
IN.  HERE IS A DISSASSEMBLED LOCK:

    \__/-------------------  <- KEY


WHEN YOU INSERT A KEY INTO A LOCK, THE
BOTTEM PINS ARE PUSHED UP, AND IF IT
IS THE PROPER KEY, THE TOPS OF THE
BOTTOM PINS WILL MATCH WITH THE SPOT
WHERE THE PLUG AND HOUSING MEET, THUS
ALLOWING YOU TO TURN THE PLUG, AND OPEN
THE DOOR, ETC.. WHEN YOU INSER THE KEY,
THE BOTTOM PINS GO INTO THE VALLEYS OF
THE KEY, THUS MEANING THAT THE KEY MUST
HAVE THE RIGHT HEIGHT VALLEYS TO MAKE
THE LOCK OPEN. PRETTY ELEMENTRY, RIGHT?
WELL NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO HOW TO PICK
A LOCK.

IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK WE (AS I SAID
BEFORE) DEPEND ON THE INACCURACY OF THE
MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE FIRST THING
TO DO IS TO INSERT THE TENSION WRENCH
INTO THE LOCK AND APPLY A SLIGHT
PRESSURE TO THE LEFT (OR RIGHT IF YOU
WISH) SO THAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE
THE LOCK AT WHERE THE PLUG AND THE
HOUSING WOULD MEET, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
THIS:

               ! !*! !
     HOUSING   ! !*! !
               ! !*! !
     __________! !*! !___________
     __________  !*! ____________
              !  !*!!
     PLUG     !  !_!!
              !   _ !
              !  !*!!
              !  \_/!

NOW A SLIGHT PRESURE IS ON THE PINS.
BECAUSE THE PINS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED
EXACTLY THE SAME, THERE IS ONE PIN
WHICH IS THE WIDEST AND THERE FORE HAS
MORE TENSION ON IT, AND ONE WHICH IS
THE THINNEST AND HAS ALMOST NO PRESSURE
ON IT. WE NOW USE THE PICK TO >GENTLY<
PUSH EACH PIN UP (AND TRY TO FEEL IT
WHEN YOU LET IT DOWN) UNTIL WE FIND
WHICH IS THE TIGHTEST ON AND WHICH IS
LOOSEST. GETTING THE FEEL FOR THIS IS
THE HARDEST PART OF LOCK PICKING. NOW
THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THE LOOSEST ONE,
GENTLY PRESS IT UPWARD UNTIL YOU FEEL
A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN TENSION ON THE
TENSION WRENCH. THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN
THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM PIN BECOMES
EVEN WITH THE JUNCTION OF THE PLUG AND
THE HOUSING. DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION
FROM THE WRENCH NOW! THE DRIVER WILL
NOW BE TRAPPED IN THE HOUSING AS
ILLUSTRATED HERE: (DON'T I DRAW PRETTY)

            ! !*! !
   HOUSING  ! !*! !
            ! !*! !
 ___________! !_! !___________
 _______________     ___________
               ! !*! !
    PLUG       ! !*! !
               ! \_/ !
               !     !

NOW YOU CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH EACH
OF THE PINS UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR WAY UP
TO THE ONE THAT IS WIDEST. WITH SOME
PRACTICE YOU CAN GET FAIRLY FAST AT
THIS. I SUGGEST PRACTICING ON A FOUR
PIN TUMBLER LOCK THAT IS BOUGHT FROM A
HARDWARE STORE, THE CHEAPER THE BETTER.

I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS A PATICULAR
CONFIGURATION OF THE PINS NOW THAT MAY
PRESENT A PARTICULARLY HARD JOB TO
PICK. THIS IS GRAPHICLY SHOWN HERE BY
THE TWO MIDDLE PINS:

        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        !*! !*! !_! !*!
        !*! !*!  _  !*!
        !_! !*! !*! !_!
         _  !*! !*!  _
        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        !*! !_! !*! !*!
        !*!  _  !*! !*!
        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

             \_______________

WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THE 2ND PIN FROM
THE LEFT UP, YOU WILL UNAVOIDABLY BE
PUSHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT UP BE-
CAUSE OF IT'S LONG BOTTOM PIN. THE ONLY
SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO GET A SPECIAL
PICK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:

         \
          \   _______________
           \_/

THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT
IS HARD TO INITIALLY DETECT. THE REASON
THAT IT MAKES IT HARDER IF IT IS NOT
IMMEDIETLY APPERANT IS THAT YOU UN-
AVOIDABLY PUSH THE 3RD PIN FROM THE
LEFT UP INTO THE HOUSING, GETTING IT
JAMMED:

             ! !*! !
   HOUSING   ! !_! !
             !  _  !
             ! !*! !
   __________! !*! !________
   ___________ !*! ________
              !!*!!
     PLUG     !!*!!
              !\_/!


I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED RAKING. IT USES A
TOOL LIKE THIS:

        \/\/\/\___________

BASICLY YOU "RAKE" IT BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE PINS, HOPING THAT COMBINED
WITH THE TENSION IT WILL GIVE YOU THE
RIGHT COMBINATION. THIS WAY HAS BEEN
KNOWN: FAST SOMETIMES, BUT IS
NOT VERY RELIABLE, AND I WOULD SUGGEST
LEARNING TO ACTUALLY "PICK" THE LOCK.

EARLIER I PROMISED AN ADDRESS TO ORDER
LOCKSMITHING MATERIALS FROM, SO HERE IT
IS:

 GARRISON PROTECTIVE ELECTRONICS
            BOX 128
  KEW GARDENS, NEW YORK, 11415

SOURCES: PERSONAL PRACTICE AND MANY
EXCELLENT BOOKS FROM MENTOR PRESS, IF
YOU WOULD LIKE THEIR CATALOG, SEND A

SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL. WELL, IF YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE JAMES BOND
 AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
 PLACE YOUR GONNA DO IT. EVEN EXPERIENCED LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES
 ON A LOCK IF THEY'RE UNLUCKY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXTREMELY QUICK ACCESS,
 LOOK ELSEWHERE.
  THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE
 LOCK, SINCE IT IS THE EASIEST TO PICK. IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL
 LATER WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING THE OTHER FORMS OF ENTRANCE, INCLUDING 
DEAD-BOLT

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE 
YOU
 A SET. THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
 LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
 YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES
 FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH SET (VERY SMALL). THESE SHOULD BE SMALL
 ENOUGH TO FIT INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT. NOW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN
 WRENCH AT A SLIGHT ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

  #1
       \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\         (THIS IS THE HANDLE
                                           \\\        THAT WAS ALREADY
                                           \\\        (HERE.)
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\

NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A FILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL IT'S
 ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INSIDE THE LOCK.  TEST YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT
YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY.
 NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN. IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND
YOUR PICK TO BE USED IN THE SAME LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OTHER ?
LETS HOPE SO, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOUR GONNA OPEN IT.

IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFER TO THIS CHART OF THE INTERIOR OF A
LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX| K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    | E
    #     #   #   #    | Y
 *     *               | H
 *  *  *  *   *   *    | O
                       | L
                       | E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALL

(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)

THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE UPPER PIN AND
 THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WITH THE CYLINDER WALL. NOW, IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS
 TENDANCY IS TO FALL BACK DOWN, RIGHT ? THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES 
IN.
 INSERT THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AND TURN. THIS TENSION WILL KEEP THE
 "SOLVED" PINS FROM FALLING BACK DOWN. NOW, WORK FROM THE BACK OF THE LOCK TO
 THE FRONT, AND WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.....
THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL
 OPEN. DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT
 20-30 MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH
 PRACTICE.
