Automotive Locking Systems
--------------------------

  Automotive locks vary considerably in the types of locking mechanisms and lock
arrangements.  There are many other methods of gaining access to an automobile
which are quite often quicker and easier than attempting to pick the lock.

  Probably the most common point of entry is the wing or vent window, or, in the
newer models, the rubber molding.  Anyone intending to engage in automobile lock
work (or desiring to save approximately fifty dollars or more in service calls)
will need some special tools.  Both the curve and length of tools are important
to their overall effectiveness.

  The tool being used should first be lubricated with a glycerine-based hand
lotion or hand cleaner before inserting it through the weatherstripping.  This
not only makes the tools work easier, but helps prevent scarring, tearing or any
other damage to the weatherstripping.

  To open most front wing windows, take the lever latch tool and insert it
through the weatherstripping between the wing window and the window trim.
Manipulate the tool by controlling the depth of penetration along the curve.  At
the same time use a rocking action to move the window lock into the unlocked
position.

  One other type of wing window lock has a lever latch equipped with a plunger
at the pivot of the latch.  The plunger deadlocks the latch against rotation,
unless the plunger is first pushed in and held until the initial stage of
rotation has been accomplished.  This requires that another tool be inserted
through the weatherstripping and the door window to depress the plunger and hold
it in that position while the other tool is used to rotate the latch.  Normally,
the tool used for depressing the deadlocking plunger has a slight curve at the
tip.  The tool's only purpose is to depress the plunger.

  Another means of access, when the door window is fully raised and the door is
locked, consists of inserting a stiff bent wire, and using it directly on the
locking mechanism.  Tripping of the lock mechanism may often be done by pulling
up on the wire once the tip of the wire has been positioned under the lock
linkage.  At other times, the bent tip of the wire must be pulled up against the
linkage and then rotated to trip the locking mechanism.  With practice one gets
the feel of what is required to open the door.

  Automobiles using a rocker type of locking mechanism may be tripped by using a
thin piece of flat spring steel stock.	First, coat the tool with a
glycerine-based hand lotion or hand cleaner to protect the trim and rubber
molding.  Insert the tool next to the glass or between the
weatherstripping/molding and the metal of the door.  Feel for the lock linkage
with the notched end of the tool, then move the linkage up and down until the
lock moves into the unlocked position.

  Another avenue of access to most automobiles is through the firewall, reaching
the door locks with a long stiff wire to push the lock button into the unlocked
position.

  Since automobile door locks on most newer models are normally held in place by
a retainer clip, as a last resort the lock can be punched out.	First, insert a
bent piece of wire into the keyway and bind it to prevent the lock mechanism
from falling into the door frame.  Once out, the automobile can be opened by
pushing up on the linkage attached to the lock mechanism.
