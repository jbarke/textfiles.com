+++ The Other Side of the Fence: Chapter 20.

     What can your target do to defend himself against your harassment?  What countermeasures can heake?  It is important to be aware of the possible countermeasures in order to be able to forestall hm and to protect yourself against discovery and reprisals.
     Most of the defenses are obvious.  They are simple and forthright reactions to the threats as ty appear.  The target can be expected to make efforts to have spurious magazine subscriptions canceld.  He can ask the phone company for help.  He can put a tape recorder on his line.  As a last resrt he can have his phone changed or disconnected.  These will do him little good since you can subsrib him to still more magazines, find out his ew phone number, and strike at him through the mail o telgr
aph.  Never under any circumstances call him from a phone that can be traced to you.
     He can call he public utilities to have the services restored.  He can eventually cances a chan of address card at the local post office but he won't be able to get back the diverted mail if youv handled it right.  All of these responses will take up lots of his valuable time.  Meanwhile he i vlnerable through other channels.  The more you cause to happen to him in a certain period of time th more difficulty he will have in coping with each threat.  You will saturate his defenses.
     If you hit him hard enough he may leave his job and move out of town.  Life will have become inlerable for him and he will run.
     However, it is good to remember that the best defense is a good offense.  Your target will consntly be trying to figure out who is doing this to him so that he may retaliate.  His retaliation, i e discovers you, may show some sophisticaton or be directly violent.  It will no doubt be very unpeaant for you and you may have to leave town.
     Your target will surely have several suspects in mind.  With a little imagination it should be ssible to 'frame' one of them for your activities.  Keep in mind what the consequences may be for teone you frame and only do this if he is as equally deserving as your target.


+++ Trouble With the Law: Chapter 21.

     Two questions which you will be asking yourself all the time you're planning out a program agait your target will be: What can the police do to me if they catch me? and "How can I avoid getting aght?"
     Most of the actions suggested here are not even illegal.  Some are misdemeanors.  A couple, sucas the one involving norcotics, are definitely felonies in most states.  You can be sure that, for h most part, if your target complains to the police that someone is out to "get" him, they will seeth matter as being out of their jurisdiction.  After all what can the police do about someone sendig apizza to someone else's house?  If the target is an influential person and th actions you take aains h
im are extensive, they may provide him with a bodyguard if he can convince them that there is a thre to his life.  This is very unlikely and even if it does happen it will not hamper you at all.
     To avoid getting caught, it is necessary only to follow the simple rules of security discussed sewhere in this manual.  Keep in mind that the actions suggested are designed to be untraceable to o and that the police's manpower and resources are very limited.  This last point requires some disusion.
     Anyone who takes a careful look at a real police department rather than at the TV cops sees thathey are overworked, understaffed, and do not solve most of the crimes reported to them.  A quick lo at the annual FBI report for 1973 shows that the percentage of cases "cleared by arrest" stands a 7 percent for murder and goes down to under 20 percent for lesser crimes such as burglary.  The moe volent the crime, the more effort is put into solving it: the less violent, the more is the tendecy t p
ut it into the file along with all the others and get to it when time permits.  There is a tendency  some police departments to persuade suspects to confess to crimes they did not commit, in ordr to e them off th books and o pad he clearance rate.  The police make a "deal".  The suspect confesses ndn return gets a reduced and perhaps a suspended sentence.  This is wha often accounts for the spetace of desproportionally light sentences being handed out for relatively serious crimes.
     The police's way of working is also germane to this discussion.  Rarely in real life, as contraed to the TV cops, are the latest advances in science brought to bear upon the solution of the crim. Rarely are entire teams of detectives assigned to a case.  The police don't have the manpower to ro everything and intensively investigate any but the most serious crimes.  An ordinary murderer wil tpically have two detectives assigned to seeking him.  These two detectives usually have a caselod ofot
her murders upon which they are working at the same time.  Only in the case of a cop-killer or a bizre sex murder is the full manpower of a police department brought to bear upon the problem.  To sumu, your target's complaint, even if accepted by the police, will have to wait its turn at the end o avery long line.
     The way in which the police solve cases is important to consider.  Most of the time, it is doney informants.  These are people who either get paid for their information or are under suspicion thmelves and try to make a "deal" with the police in order to obtain lenient treatment.  Surveillance tlephone taps and traces, and other exotic means of detection are rarely used because hey are expesiv, both in equipment and manpower, and because most of the time they cannot be used in court.  Coside t
hat it takes at least three men to maintain a round-the-clock tap on a particular call, and yet moreen to speed to the scene and make an arrest and you can see ho much of a problem a telephone surveilnce is.  For a police department to put that much effort into solving a crime which most likely isony a misdemeanor and which does not involve violence, is unthinkable when you consider the great nmbe of violent crimes being committed every day.
     The myth of your handwriting being traced by checking Army records, old school records, etc., clapses when you consider the huge manpower effort that it would involve.  In any event, the risk isrlatiely easy to avoid.
     Finally, the probability of the case holding up in court is very, very poor.  The FBI statisticshow that only a fraction of the crimes cleared by arrests conclude with a successful prosecution. Wat the police know and what they can prove in court are obviously two different things.
     The greatest danger to you is not from the police but from your target.  If he comes to suspectou, that suspicion does not have to stand up in court for him to begin his own retaliatory program fharassment.  Therefore it is very important to follow the security measures outlined in this manua. Do not have any personal contact with your target: do not talk about your plans to anyone who doe no need to know; and allow enough time to elapse in order to give your target time to forget aboutyou. B
y following these simple rules you will not be trusting to just luck but will be actively safeguardi your own security.


+++ Your Target is Vulnerable: Chapter 22.

     The strategy of harassment is built on the premise that most people in twentieth century Americare vulnerable to serious disruption of their lives through clever manipulations of society's own isitutions.  They are vulnerable because everyday life for almost everyone is so complex and becauseofthe interdependency upon which we must rely for even the barest necessities. Everyday life is so eliately balanced for most of us that one thing or another is almost constantly going wrong even wihoutou
tside interference.  Power failures and subway strikes, delayed or lost mail are so common that we aost consider them as normal occurences.
     Most of the technological aids of the twentieth century are essentially two-sided in that they n be helpful or harmful.  A credit card is a great convenience but if you lost yours you may find ta someone else has been charging purchases to your account.  The telephone, which can be found in amot everyone's home, can be either an extremely useful gadget or an instrument of evil.  The same istrment that enables you to speak with someone across the continent can also bring you sales soliciatios,
 crank calls, or wrong number calls at three o'clock in the morning.
     Today, when many feel that they live in a country in which people enjoy greater freedom than mo other people on earth, we are more and more becoming trapped by the constraints of the twentieth cnury industrial society.  We really have less day-to-day freedom than our grandparents did.  We hav mre obligations to meet, taxes to pay, bills and mortgages to pay; there are more laws which we mut oey than ever before.  We have to reprt to jobs that are more complex and require more skills tha eve b
efore and yet we are increasingly insecure in those jobs.  Our lifestyles are more threatened and weave fewer defenses than ever before.
     Who is most vulnerable?  Everyone except the very poor and very rich -- the poor because they he little to lose.  They often do not have phones or cars and many do not even have jobs.  Few own ter own homes.  It is next to impossible to have anything delivered to a ghetto address.
     The very rich are well insulated from the hassles of the everyday world.  They have secretarieso answer their mail and other employees to answer the phone and the doorbell.  The usual harassmentmasures will only fall upon the emloyees, not the target himself.
     Nevertheless, there are still some measures that can be taken against someone who is at one of e extremes of the economic spectrum.  The task requires more intelligent planning, better informatin and the plan must be tailored to the individual case.
     Some of the rich are vulnerable because their activities are publicized.  They also do a lot mo travelling then most other people.  This makes them especially prone to having their reservations acelled by spurious telegrams, to cite one possibility.


+++ Planning It Out: Chapter 23.

     As you have seen from the preceeding chapters, everyone is vulnerable to harassment in many way  It is possible, by careful planning and a moderate amount of effort, to make life absolutely miseale for the one whom you select to harass.
     One of the first things you must consider in making your plan is how much you are prepared to snd, in both money and time.  The main reason that harassment is not used much more than it is, is ta most people do not go about it systematically and soon find themselves spending so much time, wit s little results in proportion, that they soon get tired of it and give up.  You can see, however,tha you get big results from little effort if you approach the problem in the right way.
     Money is another problem.  Most of the techniques outlined here cost very little to apply; the st of a few phone calls, a couple of dollars in postage.  Some can cost a lot more; the cost of renig a car, the service of an accomodation address.  Decide in advance what you can afford.
     Using the multiplier effect is the key to getting maximum results with a minimum of effort.  Thsecond most important thing is to have the various phases of your plan properly coordinated so thattey do not conflict with each other and cancel each other out.  You can easily see that it makes nosese to have your target's phone service cut off on the same day that your classified ad offering geenstamps appears in the paper.  Proper timing is all-important.
     Lead times are also considered.  It takes various amounts of time to put the various phases of ur plan into effect.  A change of address card takes a couple of days: magazine subscriptions take eks: a delivery of booze or flowers takes only minutes between the time you place the call an the dliery itself.  Lay out these different lead times on a chart.  See how they tie in with each other.    Select the date on which you want your program to begin.  Call it D-Day.  You can see that yourpreprations may have to begin weeks ahead of D-Day.  This is just as well because you don't want tobe chked with more work on the last few days before the big day.
     You do have a job to keep: you do have personal commitments to attend.  You can't tie up your te for several days straight.  Proper planning will smooth out your workload.
     Selecting the things you want to do to your target is important.  Not every phase can be applieto everyone.  If your target is unmarried, or does not own a car, it will limit your choices somewht  Whatever you do, don't try to do too much at one time.  Time is on your side.  You can always hi hm with more later on.
     There is only one exception to this rule.  It is usually most effective to cut off his phone, ulities, and mail both at home and at work, on the same day.  That way he will be saturated and willb least able to take effective measures to restore these vital functions.  In fact, if his phone an uilities go out on him all at once he probably won't even notice that he's not getting any mail fo a ay or two, thereby increasing the damage.
     One final word: keep your plan a secret.  Don't tell anyone at all about it unless that person eds to know because he or she is your accomplice in some phase of it.  People do gossip.  The word iht get back to your target and then you will have just as many problems as he does.  Remember thathecan do the same things to you.
