        Ok. Now that's done with. Now, this file is going to concentrate on
using 9 Volt rectanglar batteries for laughs in school.

Idea #1-- "Look! A quarter!"
----------------------------

(1) Go to a class like a study hall or something. 
(2) Take a 9V and sit a quarter on top for 4-5 min.
(3) Take a pencil, and use it to flick the quarter off the battery into the hall
right before class ends.
(4) Listen for the screams of agony.

Explaination (in case you don't get it):
        The quarter shorts the battery out, and it feeds back on itself. That
makes the battery get really hot, and the quarter along with it. Then, when some
idiot picks the coin up in the hall, they get a nice imprint of George Washington
on their palm!


Idea #2-- "Let me just get that from my locker"
-----------------------------------------------

(1) Solder (or tape) a piece of wire to one terminal of the 9V. (Ahead of time)
(2) Move the other end of the wire over to touch the other terminal.
(3) Wedge the battery (quickly) into the shackle of a Master combo lock.
(4) Leave (quickly).
(5) Watch for big jock with smoking hand running down hall.

Explaination:
        Again, the wire shorts the battery. This gets said battery HOT. That
heat is transferred to the lock by normal laws of thermodynamic heat transfer.
When said jock (or whatever) grabs lock to put in combo, his palm turns a nice
shade of red (or BLACK!).


Idea #3-- "Look, a student dropped this litter"
-----------------------------------------------

(1) Solder (tape) a piece of wire to one terminal of 9V. (Ahead of time)
(2) Move the other end of wire to touch other terminal.
(3) Drop (toss) battery in hallway.
(4) Wait while in next class.
(5) Listen for announcement by a faculty member with a bandaged hand about the
person who left a battery in the hallway.
(6) Laugh.

Explaination:
        Is this really necessary? Same deal as #2, except, you let an
administrator pick the battery up. Cool. Or hot.


	I know this is a pretty short file, but I'll be back with more soon.
Look for 9VFIS2.TXT or a larger (updated) version of 9VFIS.TXT. Have FUN!
