WAYS TO HAVE A CHEAP THRILL... AT THE
EXPENSE OF LAW-ABIDING AMERICAN
CITIZENS:
 
1) ORDER A BB MACHINE GUN.  THEY GO FOR
ABOUT $10 IF YOU SHOP AROUND, AND ARE
CAPABLE OF WREAKING TOTAL HAVOC.  THEY
CAN HOLD AROUND 1000 BB'S, ARE LIGHT-
WEIGHT (PLASTIC, PVC) COME WITH
SHOULDER STOCK, AND CAN BE POWERED WITH
A STANDARD FREPON CAN, OR COMPRESSOR.
 
2) ASSEMBLE SOME HOME-BREW MX MISSILES.
 GO OUT AND BUY A DOZEN SMALL ESTES
ROCKETS - ONE STAGE, NO CHUTE NECESSARY
(NOSE CONE SHOULD BE REMOVABLE) AND
PREFERABLY ONE WITH A HOLLOW, PLASTIC
NOSE PIECE.  THEY COST AROUND 3 DOLLARS
A THROW.  ARM THESE WITH M-80'S (OR ANY
OTHER DEATH DEVICE) TIGHTLY PACKED
IN THE NOSE CONE.  USE A C-ENGINE WITH
A FUSE OR ELECTRIC LAUNCHER.  THE KICK-
BACK FROM THE ENGINE SHOULD, IF THE
BODY IS SHORT AND YOU DON'T USE WADDING, 
IGNITE THE FUSE.  I'VE FOUND
BEST SPORT IS TO FIRE THESE BUGGERS AT
PASSING BOATS AND SHIPS FROM THE WEST
SIDE (DESERTED) ELEVATED HIGHWAY AT
NIGHT. USE ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FOR
OPTIMUM BANG-FOR-THE-BUCK
 
3) ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO TO A
PHONE BOOTH WITH A WHITE PAGES BOOK 
ATTACHED TO IT, IS TO USE A TORCH TO
MELT THE BACK OF THE HANDSET AND WELD
IT TO THE PLASTIC COVER OF THE BOOK
 
4) PHONE PHUN - IF YOU ARE BORED OF
CHEATING GM EXECS OUT OF DOUGH BY USING
THEIR ACCOUNTS ON TRAVEL NET AND
CALLING OUTER MONGOLIA, TRY SOME >REAL<
PHONE PHUN.  BE IMAGINATIVE.  ASK
KEDORG ABOUT THE TIME HE GOT A WOMAN TO
CUT OFF HER PHONE'S GREEN (RECEIVING)
WIRE... HE EVEN HAS A TAPE OF THE
SESSION THE NICE THING ABOUT PHONE PHUN
IS THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY ALMOST FREE.
YOU CAN ALSO DO SOME AWESOME STUFF IF
YOU HAVE MULTIPLE LINES.  TRY CALLING
DIAL A PRAYER AND CONNECTING IT WITH
SOME POOR SLOB.  HE'LL THINK DIAL A
PRAYER MADE THE CALL.... OR IF YOU 
WANNA SEE FEATHERS FLY, AND CHICKENS
SQUABBLE, CALL TWO OPERATORS AND PATCH
'EM IN TOGETHER.
 
5) BB GUN FUN - IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BB
GUN WITH A SCOPE, YOU CAN DO SOME
AMAZING DAMAGE.  I HAVE A CROSSMAN 766
WITH A BUSHNELL 4X SCOPE WHICH ALLOWS
ME TO USE .177 CAL. PELLETS, OR 5 BB
ROUNDS SHOT-GUN STYLE.  KILLINGEONS IS
FUN
 
WHAT WAS I UP TO? 6? ANYWAY, A GOOD BB 
GUN WITH PELLETS AT 650-700 FPS CAN 
KNOCK OUT A GOOD PLATE WINDOW FROM 100
YARDS OR SO.  DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF
POINT THE PELLET HAS, YOU CAN MAKE
PUNCTURE HOLES, OR SMASH THE ENTIRE 
WINDOW
 
8) WRIST ROCKETS - OK, SO YOU'RE TOO
CHEAP TO BUY A RIFLE... THEN GO OUT
AND GET A WRIST ROCKET.  ALTHOUGH THEY
ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS POWERFUL, THEY
CAN BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED AS TERROR
INSTRUMENTS.  IF YOU'RE STRONG, YOU CAN
KNOCK OUT MOST NORMAL WINDOWS AT 100
YARDS.  SEE IF YOU CAN KNOCK OUT A BUS
WINDOW... I SWEAR TO GOD, THOSE NEW GM
BUSES HAVE WINDOWS MADE OF TITANIUM OR
SOMETHING.
 
8) YOU CAN WREAK MUCH HAVOC OFF A GOOD
ROOF AS WELL.  ASK MR. DEATH ABOUT
THAT! IN GENERAL, YOU WANT TO BE ON AS
HIGH A ROOF AS POSSIBLE WHICH WILL
ALLOW ACCURATE BOMBARDMENT.  THIS WAY,
ESPECIALLY IF THE BUILDING HAS SEVERAL
APTS. AND TERRACES, YOUR TARGET WILL BE
UNABLE TO LOCATE YOU.  FIREWORKS
DROPPED FROM ROOVES IS ALWAYS
ENTERTAINING.  EGGING IS AN EXCELLENT
WAY TO PASS SOME TIME TOO.  DURING
PARADES AND SHIT YOU CAN REALLY WREAK
TREMENDOUS DISRUPTION BY THROWING EGGS
BY THE DOZEN INTO THE CROWD.  THE
FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN WAS MR. 
DEATH EGGING A WOMAN IN THE WEST
VILLAGE HALLOWEEN PARADE WHO DRESSED AS
A CLOWN... THE EGG JUST LANDED OIN HER
TECHNICOLOR AFRO-WIG AND SHOWERED HER.
 
9) PIGEON FUN - THIS IS REALLY A
SEPARATE CATAGORY FOR YOU PIGEON
DIE-HARDS OUT THERE.  I MENTIONED
PLUGGING THEM WITH BB'S... YOU CAN ALSO
TRY: TYING THEIR LEGS TOGETHER... JUST
WATCH THES TRY TO LAND ON A LEDGE;
TYING M-80S TO THEIR FEET... WHAT A
TRIP!  TYING STRING AROUND THEIR BODY
SO THEY CAN'T USE THEIR WINGS AND
DROPPING THEM OFF A BUILDING, AND MY
ALL TIME FAVORITE, STRAPPING THEM TO AN
ESTES HOME-BREW MX MISSILE, AND
WATCHING THE FEATHERS FLY.
 
10) FLY FUN - THIS IS MY LATEST HOBBY. 
MY HOUSE WAS RECENTLY INVADED BY A 
SWORM OF SICKLY HUGE (I MEAN >HUGE<)
FLIES, AND I HAVE BEEN DEVISING
CONSTRUCT- IVE WAYS OF TERMINATING
THEM... AND I HAVE COME UP WITH SEVERAL
EFFECTIVE AND ENTERTAINING MEANS.
MY FAVORITE WAY IS TO SHOOT THEM WITH
RUBBER BANDS (THICK, STRONG).  REMEMBER
TO HAVE A VACUUM HANDY THOUGH, SINCE
THEY USUALLY BREAK UP INTO ITY-BITY
PIECES.  TRY SWATTING THEM IN MID-AIR.
IF YOU HIT THEM HARD ENOUGH, YOU CAN
HEAR THEM GO "CLICK" AND SAIL ACROSS
THE ROOM... THEM FIND THEM AND DISPOSE
OF THEM.  ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU FIND
THEM AND THEY ARE ONLY STUNNED, TAKE A
SPOOL OF THREAD AND TIE THE END AROUND
ITS NECK.  LEAVE THE SPOOL WITH SOME 
SLACK IN A VISIBLE PLACE, AND YOU HAVE
AN INSTANT CONVERSATION PIECE!  JUST
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL THINK!
THIS IS NOT ADVISABLE WITH NYC FLIES...
YOU WILL PROBABLY CONTRACT A TERRIBLE
DISEASE AND DIE A FIERY DEATH.  FLY'S
REVENGE.
