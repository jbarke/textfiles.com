     Most drivers wanting to make better time on the open road will arm
themselves with an expensive radar detector.  However this device will not
work against a gun type radar unit in which the radar signal is not present
until the cop has you car in his sights and pull the trigger. Then it is too
late to slow down.

     A better method is to continously jam any signal with a radar signal
of your own. I have tested this idea with the cooperation of a local cop and
found that his unit reads random numbers when your car approached him. It is
suprisingly easy to make a low power radar transmitter.  A nifty little
semiconductor called a Gunn diode will generate microwaves when supplied
with 5 to 10 vdc and enclosed in the correct size cavity (resonator). An 8
to 3 terminal regulator can be used to get this voltage from a car's system. 
However the correct
construction and tuning of the cavity is difficult without good microwave
measurement equipment.  Police radars commonly operate on the K band at 22
ghz. or more often on the X band at 10.525 ghz.  Most microwave intruder
alarms and motion detectors (mounted over automatic doors in supermarkets,
etc.) contain a Gunn type transmitter/receiver combination that transmits
about 10 milliwatts at 10.525 ghz.

     These units work perfectly as jammers.  If you can't get any locally
write to Microwave Associates in Burlington, Mass. and ask for info on
"Gunnplexers" for ham radio use.  When you get the unit it may be mounted
in a plastic box on the dash or in a weatherproof enclosure behind the
plastic grille.  Switch on the power when on the open highway.  The unit
will not jam radar to the side of behind the car so don't go speeding past
the radar trap. An interesting phenomena you will notice is that drivers in
front of you who are using detectors will hit their brakes as you approach
large metal signs or bridges.  Your signal is bouncing off these objects
and triggering their detectors.

Have fun... Ben Piper
