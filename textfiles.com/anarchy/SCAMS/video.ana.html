  The topic of free video tapes has brought more interest that i thought it
would.	When I decided to write this file, many people began to ask me "How do
you get free video tapes?" The answer to that question will be answered many a
time in this article because there is far more than one way to get free video
tapes.

  Video tapes can currently can be rented for about one to five dollars a night.
Some places, even if you are a member of their club, will ask for a $50.00
deposit on tapes.  An important thing to realize in getting free video tapes is
that most tapes retail for about $60.00.  So if you successfully get five tapes,
you've made yourself $300..  Not bad for a day's work..

  On to business.  It's really quite easy to get free video tapes once you
understand how the movie rental business works.  In the past couple of weeks,
I've managed to learn most everything there is to know about how movies are
rented.  As they famous quote says "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."
This quote will be proven true thoughout this article.	I will first explain the
more primitive ways of getting video-tapes, then explain how the video tape
rental business works, and then explain ways to use this to your best advantage.

  To start off, I will cover what I consider the more primitive ways of getting
free video tapes.

  If you know how to illegally use credit cards (naughty naughty you), you can
call up places and simply card them.  This will work especially well with porno
tapes, because tapes of this sort are not usually on display in the video
department of Lechmere.  If you need numbers of places to call to get free video
tapes, go out and buy (steal, card, whatever) a copy of any video magazine,
where there is usually at least 200 advertisements for places to buy video
tapes.	In these advertisements it is also possible to get free video equipment.
but that is carding and this is something different.  There is another use for
CC's that I will discuss later.

  The place where I work has all the video tapes behind a very accessable desk.
If you can find a kid who will bother the guy at the register enough while the
manager is in the back, you can usually just go back, take a few tapes, and
calmly walk out of the store..	Another nice method is if you have a brother
about 8 years old, who can keep his mouth shut..  The younger looking he is, the
better..  Just keep saying how annoying the kid is and ask the guy to show you
the video machines.  Then your little baby brother can just crawl over and take
a few video tapes..  If the guy catches him, just hit your brother and say, "Oh
my goodness, he just can't keep his hands off anything!!".  A guy had done this
once where I worked, but I nailed the sucker since he was stupid.  The little
kid brought the tape to his older brother, and I said, "Ummm, sir..."..  The guy
started walking out of the store, but I nailed his ass..  If you can, tell your
brother to hide the cassette in his shirt or something, but don't have him give
it to you..

  Copying the tapes is just another way, only problem is that it actually costs
money to copy tapes.  You have to buy blank tapes, etc.  etc.  and you need two
video recorders.  A good place to do this is school since they usually have at
least 5 video recorders around.

  One more primitive method is if you have a friend who works there..  Have him
act like he's signing them up for you but in reality, he won't.  Be careful,
since if the manager notices the movie missing during your friend's shift, he
will often have to pay for it.	A major rule of getting free video tapes is to
be careful not to get your friend busted.

Ok, onto the better methods..

  First let me explain how the movie rental business works nowadays.  Some
places will only allow you to rent movies if you rent or lease equipment from
them.  Other places will allow you join the club for about fifty dollars, and
then have the ability to take cassettes out for about five dollars a night.
Either way way, you usually end up with a membership of some sort..  You then
have the ability to rent out video tapes for very cheap prices, and usually
without any deposit.  Where I work, this membership will give you an account
number.  In other places, all you really need is a name, and occasionally a
card.  Where I work, the place used to give plastic fancy cards, but the place
got lazy so it doesn't do that any more.

  What does this mean?	This means that if you have a guy's name (the account
number is not really needed, but if you have the card, you'll have a much better
chance of success), then you can just about get as many free video tapes as you
want.

  There are a few problems with the methods I will cover in a second..	Most of
the managers who work at video places have extremely good mem1	8<‚IÇø898‡ Ð§v÷&G2Â–b–÷Rvò$†’"Â–b–÷R&VçFVBWV—ÖVçBÂF†W’vÆÂ&R&ÆRFò6’$ö‚Â†Ð¤ÙPolice agency for local coordination.  In case
of k, I can't really say what will hn be- cause I don't know.  Speculating, Ieve
the Army rponse will be much greater.  Instead of MP's, combat troops will be
airlifted along with the Decon.  and Emergency Ordnance Disposal troops.  State
police will also flood the area and seal if off, with local units merely
handling roadblocks at the perimeters.	Any non-authorized (non-government)
aircraft passing near the area will be either escorted out by the TAC, oif the place allows you to sign up in one
town's store and then have the ability to take tapes out in a store under the
same name in a different town.	This is the most successful and best way I
think.	Read the part later on about account numbers and the way they are set up
(at least for the store which i work at).  Three, you are a new member there,
and he doesn't recognize you.  (I personally don't like this one, use either of
the others since they usually remember new people).

  I will now explain a few of the methods you can use to get and to use the
account numbers..

  Getting and using false cards or names I will give a quick description of how
account numbers are set up and then describe ways to use them.	How the account
numbers are set up - This really depends on the store.	However, the place where
I work has a very easy system to figure out.  all the cards from my store start
with XXYYYY.  XX is a two digit store number, which is followed by 4 more
numbers.  It is best to make sure you know the set up of the store where you
plan on doing this before you do it.  A nice thing about this store number deal
is when you have a video rental place such as the place I work at, if you get
the card of a person in one town, if you bring it to another town, you can still
use the card, but the chances of being caught are so slim, I don't even consider
it.  Other places will only need a name.  Remember, you will often run into
people with photographic memory who memorize faces..  Whatever you do, don't
panic.

  How to get the Cards : There are basically two types of cards to look for,
plastic and paper.  However, as I said before, the place where I work is very
lazy, so they usually don't issue the plastic ones anymore.  Now, if you know
someone that works there, you can have them steal a few of the paper things upon
which people account number and name is written on.  Most people carry their
cards in the wallets (obviously) so if you come accross a membership card, don't
through it away.  Use it quickly.  You can also make your own cards.

  There are other advantages of working at these places.  It's very easy to
steal the late charges by simply not ringing the charge in, but you can do this
in any store, so just figure it out.  I don't waste my time with this.  It's
just another way to make money in case you're curious.

  "Dropping the Tapes off in the morning" Many places have a little mail slot
where you can drop off your tapes if you work, and you can't drop off the tapes
due to your work hours, but don't want to pay late charges.  I did a little
research on this and found that many places have a key you can get to drop the
tapes off when the store is closed.  If you have a membership there, you can
usually buy a key like this for about 50 cents.  I decided to check into this
furthur and found this when you dropped the video tapes in, they were dropped in
a large box.  However, by the end of the night, especially on Monday nights, the
box was overflowing and it was possible to reach in and grab video tapes.  If
you brought along one of the things you use to put logs on the fire, it would be
very easy to snag at least 10 tapes, and probably 20 on monday nights.
(20*60$=1200$).  Remember also, if the place loses 1200$, they will probably
find out it and will probably stop the policy of allowing people to use the
keys.  I was informed by someone that some of the more expensive video places
have video cameras watching the slot so if I were you, I would I would park my
car or bike in a place behind the store, and probably wear a mask of some sort.

Now for a quick summary...



 The Video Tape Frauder's Commandments
------------------------------
  Thou shalt not steal from places that are large and that may contain cameras
and other such equipment..  Stick to smaller places.

  Thou shalt not use the card of a black man when thou are not of the black
race, and visa versa.

  Thou shalt seek out stupid looking salesmen, not people who look like they
know all the people who hold accounts there, such as the phenomenon known as
managers.  If the place starts to look for new people (ie.  a help wanted sign),
wait until you see the new person, and then use the methods on him or her.
You've probably noticed that I've mentioned this about 4 times in the article.
This is because this is one of the most important things you should do, for a
foolproof day of video tape theft.

  Thou shalt not panic, under any circumstances.  If thou runs into a problem,
thou shalt say, "Shit, I can't believe you guys are so screwed up.  I'm going to
go home and fix this whole thing up." and walk angrily out of the store.

  Thou shalt use the account of a person in another town if possible.  Thou
shalt be sure that the person does not use that store often, or thou shalt have
his royal ass burnt.

  Thou shalt know the way the store is run before thou tries anything of the
illegal type.

  Thou shalt not get a friend who works at a video place busted if he helps you
steal tapes when he is working there, by saying "He gave them to me!!" or
anything of the like.

  If thou decides to try to get tapes from the video boxes late at night, thou
shalt wear a mask, and do it when it is as dark as possible.  Thou shalt also be
on the look-out for cameras and cops who are patrolling the area.

  Thou shalt not come running to me if thou gets busted for being very very
stupid.
