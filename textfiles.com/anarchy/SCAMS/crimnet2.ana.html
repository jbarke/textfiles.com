When and Which houses to hit.
--------------------
You will have to definantly have to hit a home where no one is home, unless
you
 are a dumb ass, or you are a Serious murderer or something like that.
The best way is to find out who is going on vacation, or who will be gone for 
the night...make sure you do this about 1-2 in the morning! No one should know
who you are!
 
Breaking Into the House     
-----------------------
    As Byte Blaster and I have found to be a good Quanity in people is 2.
Alot of people could give you away. There are a few techniques for breaking
and entering the house. The way Byte Blaster and I figure is the safest and 
best way is what we call the "BWAR" Technique(Break Window and Run). Will
We surely go over this technique with you. And make sure mostly everyone is 
inside and maybe sleep. Try not to make alot of noise while breaking in
And don't walk around the area alot before you break&enter. This is what we 
call "Chicken Shit!". So go straight to it!                                 
Here we will go over some of the techniques that we know for                 
Breaking & Entering.
 
 
BWAR(Break Window And Run)
----       
    This is the far easiest,safest way(For Byte and I anyway!).
First you find a side or rear window that you can break. Find a rock that you
can throw through the window. And here's what you have to do...
 
1st) Make sure no one is looking.
2nd) Throw the rock through the side are rear window.
3rd) Run to a place were you can see if anyone comes outside to see what
happen
4th) Look and see if someone comes out.
5th) Go home and chill for about a hour.
6th) Come back out and see if there are policemen or anything.
7th) Unlock the window through the hole you made with the rock.
8th) Open window and enter.
 
By the way... If the window is already unlocked, you can just go in when you
first get there, just don't let anyone see you.
Don't rub your hand prints all over the window either.
   
You can also look under rugs, behind bushes ,ect.. for a spare key.
 
 
Other Ways to Gain entry.
-------------------------
 
  Well, Now we will discuss using the Great invention of the Glass Cutter,
I'am not going to tell you Who to use the glass cutter, Read the instuctions
on the back, But Were to apply the glass cutter,
Ok you will need
2 People 
1 glass Cutter
1 suction Cup
1 FlashLight
 
Procedure.
----------
 
  You will wanna cut in a Place were U will be able to unlock all of the locks
witch are on the window, Take the Flashlight and Examine the Window and find
What kind of Locks are keeping the Window Secure, Usally there are 2, One
basic
lock and 1 long piece of Wood or Metal to also Secure the Window, Place the  
 
suction cup in the middle of the Piece you are going to cutt then Cutt the 
window and once you have made the Complete Square or Circle Pull the glass
free
with the Suction cup, (Also Some Windows have maybe 2-3 layers for keeping in
Heat, Or Cool Air,) So this Procedure may have to be Repeated several times.
Once you have gotten through the glass reach in and unlock the window, (The
hole should be cutt for your arm size, So you will be able to reach all locks)
 The Go in,
 
Smashing the Quiet way.
-----------------------
  
  If the area of interest is somewhat actively populated, a rock thru the
window just may not cut it...  A nice little common sense trick to try is
taping the window (this also works very nicely with automobiles).  Duct tape
is nice, but
almost any should do.  Apply well, such the it covers most of the area of the
window (do and X with some strip going back & forth, up & down, etc).  Then
strike with a large blunt object (large in proportion to the window - a small
smashing object on a large window will produce more noise than a larger
smashing object would).  The striking sound will still be heard, but the
clattering glass (noisiest) will not since most of the pieces are stuck to
the tape.
 
The Garage door opener.
-----------------------
 
  This takes some electronics know-how, but will provide an easy way into any
garage with an electric opener & can be lots of fun.  Exact plans, or
schematics have not been included but we'll go over the basic principle. 
Garage door openers have a special little code they use to open only that
door.  Make something that will scan thru all the different possibilities 
(like a lousy sequential code hacker).  That way, within a few minutes the
door will open, & all you have to do is turn on your snazy little device. 
Drive right in if you wish - load your van up with all the goods right inside
!  
 
 
Where to Look.
--------------
  Well once you gain entry You want to make it Quick and Sweet, Ha, 
You will want to search
 
(1) Dresser Drawers
(2) Closets
(3) Jewerly Boxes (OF COURSE)
(4) Under Beds
(5) Basements
(6) And any where you want 
(7) Common Sense should strike here!
 
  But you really dont want to Stay in the house over 20 mins. Just in
case someone Saw you or something...
 
 
Construction sites.
-------------------
 
  These are usually fun & but not quite as profitable as your regular breakin
.  It's not even a break in actually, since its all open.  Regardless, there
are lots of materials & many times equipment left laying around.  Look when
the house is on the stage of just about getting doors/windows & not developed
very well (has that styrofoam looking shit where the walls will go).  this is
when the wiring usually goes in therefore lots of yet unused rolls of wire
lying around for your electrical needs.  
 
 
 
  Also, in most all theft cases, police do will not fingerprint unless there
is a suspect.  But be careful regardless.  Do not dress like a burgler.  But
do not dress like you!  Disguise yourself so that you look like a normal
person, other than yourself.  Also, either sneak around so much that no one
could possibly see you, or try to seem like a normal pedestrian.  A jogger is
usually a nice cover.  As in any other criminal act, just use alot of common
sense and everything should go down smoothly.

Good Places to Shop Lift
------------------------
     You should steal from open places that have many escapes (for if you get
spotted!). Places like shopping centers, a By-it-self store. That means stores
aren't in shopping centers/malls. I think you get the point there.
 
How To Act
----------
Ok, you must remmeber these things while shop lifting:
       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       !1) Don't have a Guilty/Suspicious look on your face.  !
       !                                                      !
       !2) Don't look in a hurry, act as you would if you were!
       !   just looking around.                               !
       !                                                      !
       !3) Make sure that where ever you hide it, it is not   !
       !   noticable! Sometimes a piece of software will stick!
       !   out and you will not notice it until after you're  !
       !   caught!                                            !
       !                                                      !
       !4) Don't stay in the store too long! Or else the      !
       !   employees start to wonder.                         !
       !                                                      !
       !5) Don't shop lift at the same store all the time.    !
       !                                                      !
       !6) Don't run or do anything that will attrack the     !
       !   attention of employees/guards.                     !
       !                                                      !
       !7) Don't piss around. Get your shit quickly & casually!
       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 
  The people who are supposed to be in stores are shoppers.  Therefore, you
want to blend in so not to be noticed.  Blending in requires you to seem like
a shopper.  If you're not quite exactly sure on the behavioral patterns of a
shopper, spend some time observing them.  Also, try acting odd or figity 
(while not attempting to lift anything) to see how employees react & to see
how far you will have to go in your little act.
 
Thus, the biggest point is ACT LIKE A SHOPPER.
 
 
If You Get Caught?
------------------ 
    Hmm, you messed up ,eh? Oh well... 
There's 3 things you can try.
 
        1) Act real sorry and tell the manager you didn't mean it
           and that you'll never do it again. Try to create some
           tears if possible. There's two things that may happen:
 
A: He can let you go free.
B: He can press charges & you can pay the fine, or smack him and run! But make
   sure you can get away!
 
        2) Deny anything he says!
 
        3) Sit there and pay the fine..
 
Authoritative figures (fascists!).
----------------------------------
 
A) Store employees - These should present little problem with confrontations.
a
                     smooth bullshitter should be able to talk his way from
any
                     such persons.  However, some could be bitchy since some
                     employees have to pay for whats stolen during their
shift.
                     Then just bs your way out.
 
B) Mall Rent-a-cops - These men are complete bastards who will try to make
the 
                      smallest little thing into a major federal offense.  
                      NOTE: Rent-a-cops are the big fatasses who roam the 
                      malls with their walkie talkies & plastic sticks
                      (can't have real guns).  Most are old & overweight so
                      you should be able to outrun them but they do have
                      radio but are so unorginzed it really doesn't matter.
 
C) Local cops - These are touchy.  some are bastards like above, and others
                are quite gullable.  Use your best bullshitting here.
 
D) State cops - forget it!  staties are bad news.  they are almost completely
                immune to even the best bullshitting.  These guys are smart
                and should never be underestimated.  The best thing to do with
                a state cop is to NEVER lie but try to make your actions sound
                as good and innocent as possible. Since they see alot of
really
                major violence/crimes/etc try to make your little mishap
sound 
                as innocent as possible.  Throw yourself at their mercy & pray
                they let you go somehow.
 
E) Feds - if you've gotten busted for something so big that these guys show
up,
          get a lawyer...  
      
 
Things to watch for.
--------------------
 
1) Employees watching you.  If you notice this, & you've got goods hidden
away,
   try & get rid of them somehow. Or act like you're comparing similar
products
   or like you have a question about that particular product.
 
2) Reflective looking balls in the ceiling.  this are nasty since there aren't
   always cameras inside, & if there is, you don't know where they're pointed.
   
3) Cameras & mirrors, naturally.
 
4) Undercover people or little kids.  Little kids are simply amazed at
   shopplifters.  They will not take their eyes off yo.  This could lead to
   one squeeling, or simply making others aware that somethings not right
about
   you thus attracting more unwanted attention.
