This is a fun thing you can do if you own a pick-up truck. I haven't done it
in mine, yet, but that's only cause I don't have the cash to buy the pipe
at the moment. All you need is:

4' long lead or steel pipe, 4" Diam
several yds of nylon cord or other strong string

Attach the cord to the release of the tailgate. String that up so it goes
into the cab somehow. THrough a window or whatever. It really doesn't matter.
Just be sure that if you yank the string, and let it go, the tailgate drops.
Now, just put the pipe in the bed of the truck. Drive. When some asshole cuts
you off, then get around in front of him again, and floor it. Just as the car
jerks, yank the cord and keep your foot on the floor. The pipe rolls out.
The other car swerves, hits other cars....much fun. Sorry, officer, the tail
gate must have come undone. I was on my way to help my uncle install a swim-
ming pool. (Just be sure you hide the cord).
