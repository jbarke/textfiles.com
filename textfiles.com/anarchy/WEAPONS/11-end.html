11.11  Ninja Recipe

Author: The Ninja Warrior
Dated: 01-05-1985


	This will be a series written every so often to inform you future
ninjas  or killers out there.  I will write a series of philes on the secrets
of the ninja.  This is no bullshit you see in the books in your local martial
arts store.  This is the real shit.  Don't abuse your powers.

***WARNING***

	If you follow instructions in any of the series and you do harm someone
bad I will take no blame for it. Please don't intend to use these tricks as a
childish joke. Some of the things i might write may be very harmful...
most likely deadly.


Background:

	I was born in japan, raised and taught the art of ninjutsu from my
family. I immigrated to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen. I've been studying
the art for over 15 years now. I am revealing some of the secrets to you since
many people are writing bullshit to please the kids, and all that bull makes me
mad. It seems like the books can sometimes degrade us, the present ninjas.

Poison:

	There were many types of poison used in the old days in japan. Most of
the poison was made at home with plants, herbs, and other ingredients obtainable
very easily. In this series i will discuss a certain type of poison which has
a delaying death effect.

Warning:

	This poison is deadly. I know someone in my clan who has used this
type of poison to kill a phew people. It worked for a while but eventually
he was caught. He is in jail for a life sentence for murder.

Poison:

	This poison will kill the affected victim within a week. The reason
for the time delay is that the poison causes the victim to get tetanus. This
process can be fatal, so please be very careful in using this poison.

	The poison is fairly simple to make. Using it to kill someone is
somewhat complicating.

	This is an infectious poison so make sure you haven't any cuts on your
hands when preparing the poison.

Ingredients:

	Horse Shit (extracted)
	Human Blood (type depends on victim)

	You can get horse shit from most anywhere nowadays since there are
cops with horses nowadays. Just walk around where you know horses pass by,
and get a small quantity of horse shit. Don't get a lot cause that shit
stinks.

	Take some horse shit put it in a test tube and put a rubber stopper
on top. Once you obtain the horse shit, you must extract the necessary part
of the shit.

	You must remove all the hay and other garbage in the horse shit. You
can remove the rubber stopper and heat the shit over a light flame. The shit
should start to melt and the junk is extracted out of the shit.

	When the shit melts, dump it on some kind of filtering system so you
can remove the junk. repeat the process until most, if possible, all of the
junk is removed. !!! CAUTION !!! This process stinks up the whole fucking
house so do it out side.

	When the shit is extracted, you must obtain the human blood. The
type of blood is very important!!!

	For example, if you want to kill the victim, you must use the blood
type which corresponds to the victim: blood type A POS. needs an A POS.
blood in the poison, and so forth.

	If you don't know  what the intended victims blood type is, that's
okay. You can use other blood types and mix them like transfusions of blood.
but the effect of the poison may be delayed or it may not be fatal. But it
should do the trick.

	Get the extracted horse shit and mix the shit with the blood. The
proportion of the blood with respect to the shit is 3 to 1, which means for
every 1 oz. of shit, there must be 3 oz. of blood, and so forth.

	Heat the mixture at a very low heat, and the mixture should start
bubbling. Try not to inhale the smell. it's known to cause cancer if you
smell it. Do not heat it with a high flame, since the bacteria in the shit
and the blood will die and the poison will become useless.

	Heat the test tube and stir the content while heating to create a
better mixture. When the content starts to change colors from red to brick
brown or reddish-brown, then remove the mixture from the flame. Allow the
poison to cool off.

	When the poison cools off, then you've just made one of the deadliest
poisons around.

	This is not a type of poison which you can just spill on the victim,
nor is it one that you can just put into someones food. It has to enter the
victim's blood streams. To do that you must use a needle or a knife to
rupture the skin in some way in order for the poison to work.

	The ninja in the olden days used what was called fukiya and fukibari.
The fukiya is a blowgun made of bamboo and the fukibari was the dart blown
out of the blowgun. We dipped the darts in this poison, then blew the dart
out of the gun immediately. We usually struck the victim at pressure points
which made the victim pass out. When the victim passed out, we removed the
dart and left the scene. The person awakens with tetanus, and dies within a
phew days, no longer than a week. Another murder without a trace.

	What can be done in modern times is get a needle dipped with the
stuff and just poke the victim. most likely the victim thinks your crazy and
continue to fight you. If the poison entered his blood stream, he will get
tetanus. When and if he finds out that he has tetanus, and gets a penicillin
shot or something, he will live. But if he finds out too late or doesn't
find out at all, he will die.

	There are many other ways of getting the poison into the victim's
blood stream. You wanting to become the true ninja can try many ways to kill
without a trace. I hope you will never use it as a joke. Be very careful
not to get the poison into your blood stream.

	Good luck and have a Nice Day.


11.12     Nicotine Sulfate

Author: Saint Anarchy

	This is one of the most lethal poisons available to the anarchist at
large. It is an insect poison found under several names. The most common is
"Black Leaf 40" and can be purchased or stolen from any well stocked garden or
discount store. This stuff is 40% Nicotine Sulfate, just a few drops in any
drink is undetectable and will kill very quickly, usually within a few minutes.

	The best way we've found to obtain the Nicotine Sulfate is by
evaporation. This should be done until the mixture is like a thin syrup and
forms into drops when put in a medicine dropper.

	One of the glories of Nicotine Sulfate is that it is absorbed by the
skin and is fatal within minutes. Death by Nicotine sulfate can only be
detected by someone taking a blood test. This is seldomn given unless the
autopsy has been ordered when foul play is suspected.

	A fine way to use Nicotine Sulfate is to carry it in a soft drink cup
and act like you accidently spilled it on your intended victim. If he or she
doesn't wash it off within a matter of seconds, the person will be dead in a
matter of minutes. There is very little chance of the victim being able to wash
it off if he or she doesn't realize what it is. If they try to rub it off, it
will be absorbed into the skin all that much sooner.


11.13     Poison Pen

	plastic retractable ball pt. pen
	1cc Tuberculin syringe (about .7cm diam. or 1/4in)
                               (needle:1cm or 3/8 in.  long)
	razor blades
	ruler


	Cut about 1/4 in. or .7cm off end of syringe tube. Generally make
the tube streamlined. Take insides out of pen. Sheer off tip of pen until
you can push the syringe in with light pressure and have all the needle,
but nothing else, protruding from the tip. Cut a mark in the syringe where
pen meets syringe. Remove syringe. Screw the sides of the pen together. Cut
pen in two at meeting place of two halves. Take the moving parts of the pen
( the 'clicker') out. Cut off all protrusions (parts that look like the
fins on a rocket) Glue all parts together like they were originally. That
part will now be called the clicker. Cut the 'push' flat part off the top
of the plunger. Cut the plunger so it is about 3/8 in. from the top of the
tube when inserted all the way. Whittle the tip of the plunger so it will
fit loosely in the clicker. Plunger end first, GENTLY push the tube into
the clip-on end of the pen as far as it will go, with moderate pressure.
Mark the place where pen meets tube. Remove the tube, measure the distance
between the two marks, and cut that much off the end of the tube. Cut and
whittle the plunger again. Place the clicker in the clip end. Insert the
plunger to about .4cc and gently push into the clip end. You should be able
to push the clicker and make the plunger move all the way down to empty. If
not, modify further. Cut a piece of plastic or paper about 2cm or 7/8in
wide, big enough to wrap around the biggest part of the pen. Tape it so it
forms a sheath or tube and paint to match the pen, like a sheath to cover
the gap between the ends when the pen is not armed.


To Arm:

        Remove the syringe parts and fill with about .4cc liquid (good poison
of course). Push the plunger end in the clip end as far as it will go. Some
liquid should squirt out, which is okay, as long as there is .1-.2cc left.
Take the other end of the pen and push it over the syringe and into the sheath.
You should place it so the needle is almost extending out of the end, but not
quite.


To use:

	 One-handed, holding with the clip on part (not touching the clicker),
slide the two ends together. The needle should slide out. Stab, depress
clicker. The syringe should inject its poison.



11.2     ASSASINATION

11.21     Getting others to Commit Suicide

Author: The Blade (A Neon Knight Presentation)


	Ahhh, I haven't written a file in quite a long time... Being a
Senior fuckin cranks... Party when ever you want, get laid by freshmen and
sophmores, its just generally fucking great...


	Well, lately, there has been many Suicides lately. A little while
ago, here in beautiful NJ, 4 teenagers said their last rites and started the
car up in the garage. This brought a smile to my face, you see, the more
people dead, the better off you are in the game of life. When people our age
die, that means the rest of us have a better chance of getting into the
college we want, cause there is less of them to compeate with. There are
more jobs to have, and maybe you might find one you like. There is more food
and other material products, and this keeps the price of everything down.
Its just better for the whole society. Who cares about the mourning family,
they'll get over it, as you know who says "another day, another death"...
Death is a fact of life for everyone, and the more dead, the better.


How you can help:

Find somebody that looks (as follows) like this:

-Real Ugly, someone who needs to be put out of misery, and so we don't have to
	    look at them

-Real Quiet, these people usally have something wrong upstairs, they can't deal
	     with other people, they are no good to you anyway.

-Real Stupid, everybody knows someone like this, like IQ of 98, someone who can
	      be pursuaded easily into the act.

-Someone with parents that prod them, like high pressure parents, who tell
	 thier kids to do well in everything or die...

(this is the good one)

-Somebody who has tried committing suicide before, cause they are fucked up
	  already and they are the easist to convince.



Convincing them:

	Ok, find one of the above and try the first tactic, total harassment.
Just rag and rag and rag and rag on them, tell them their mother sucks black
cock in hell, send letters saying that they are illegitimate, saying that
they are drafted into the Marines.. Call them up and tell her mom that she
does Crack and she's pregnant. Get a guy that looks like a total scumbag
biker with chains and shit and tell her mom that he's ready to pick her up
for their orgy. Or if its a guy tell him 'yo maun, i got de stuff, wheres de
money??"... Just make their total life hell.

				OR

	Befriend them, get real close to them, tell them you love them, you
want to be with them forever (in hell). Get close to the parents to, act
real nice, kiss some ass, be a real goody 2 shoes, feel like part of the
family. Then make up some crisis you supposedly had at home, say that your
dad is gonna kick you outa the house if (you dont cut that hair)...sorry...
you dont get a job and pay for everything you use. Say that he grounded your
for 5732 days and you can't go anywhere. Then lie to the other kid's parents
and tell them something like your (son) daughter's is hooked on drugs and get
her in trouble. Then at night tell the other party to meet you somewhere,
like on a bridge, anywhere that you can die easily. Then make her feel like
shit and ask (demand) her to go in a suicide jump together, go 1-2-3, she
jumps you stay where you are and laugh.


Pacts:

	Suicide  Pacts are the best way to get rid of alot of people at once.
Pacts usally consist of 2 to 6 people, (unlike my good friend Jim Jones who
wiped out over 300 with poisoned Kool-Aid), and are usally done in a painless
way. Try to find a bunch of depressed people and tell them to join your
little group that meets twice a week to 'talk' about everyones problems.
Bullshit with them for a week or two, show a few other ways out of depression
(which should'nt work) then tell them (strongly) about a easy way out,
convince them into a SUICIDE PACT. Probability is that if 2 or 3 agree with
it, the whole group will do it, and that's just dandy!.


Pre-act tactics:

	Now since this person is never going to be around any more, and if
you say you are going with them, tell the other party to give you all their
belongings so you can 'give it to charity, someone who really needs it'. Of
course all the goods go to bank account and some good blow.

	Also, if you play your cards right, you can take out a life insurance
policy on the person and make 10g's to 1 mil, depending on the company and
how stupid they are.

	Or if you forgot about the pre-act tactics just go to the parents and
say 'She would want me to have this' (a $2500 pioneer stereo rack system), a
few weeks after the death, and cry when you do it.


Ways of suicide:

The folling is a list of many ways to get the person to commit suicide:

-Carbon Monoxide, as in automobile exhaust, a very painless way to die. You
just sit in the car, in a garage, and it feels like you are going to sleep.


-A Gun, also another painless way, point the gun at the temple (head), aim on
an angle towards the lower base of the skull, instant DEATH.


-Slitting of the Wrists, very stupid, painful at first, but eventually you go
into shock. This way of suicide has the highest failure rate due to people
chickening out, it lasts from 20 mins. to sometimes 3 hrs. not a good way.


-Jumping off a tall building, a good way, because %50 of the people that jump
DIE of fright before hitting the ground. Somewhat tramatic for the 4 seconds
you are in the air, but more or less, a good way.


-Jumping in front of a Bus, Train,  or any Large vehicle, a %75 percent
success rate as long as your head hits againt the oncoming force quickly.
People have been mangled and lived through it, and you don't want that to
happen, you want to DIE REMEMBER??


-Overdose of Drugs, a somewhat lame way to go depending on the drug...  also
you need to take the right amount due to if you take too much, you will just
throw it up and suffer for 24 hrs... not to much, not to little, you can
determine by the recomened doseage. Sleeping pills are probably the most
painless, you just pass out. Overdoses of drugs such as Acid,LSD,and other
phyco drug is another stupid way to go, and if you live through it you are a
vegetable for the rest of your fucking life.


Drowning- A bad way to go, due to suffication people who have lived through a
near drowing say "It fucking sucks" to put it in laymens terms, not suggested.

Hanging- good if you do it right. In the old west they used a more or less
'painless' way of hanging. When they released the lever, your neck broke and
usally you couldnt feel anything anyway, and before you knew it, you we DEAD.
A relitivly good and graphic way to go.


Running your car off a cliff- Very stupid unless you have a high cliff or
mountain. People usally try to pull out at the last second, and end up
paralized for life. Not recommended.


Electricution- Not bad, as long you have a good current. Go to your local
power substation and ground yourself to something, and as soon as you touch
the ends of those big semi-condutors, you're history.


Poison- Same as drugs.


Stabbing yourself- Usally reserved for Sickos, a very painful way to die, and
you watch yourself bleed to death. Pretty beat way to go.


Drinking yourself to Death-Sounds fun, should try it sometime....but
seriously, probably not a bad way to go, get wasted, and die! Get grain
alcohol, 199 proof, good shit.


Well, I'm probably missing like hundreds of more ways, but this file is just
to get you started in the game of life. Good luck, and keep track of your
results.

11.22     Some Interesting Ways to Kill a Friend (Or Enemy)

(Parts I & II)
Author: The Gremlin (United Federation of Pirates)


	Hi,  it's me, the gremlin again.  This time, I decided to write about
some cool ways to kill somebody you don't like, and have a good time laughing
while you do it.

	If he races bmx, string a 60 pound test line across a jump or in the
middle of the track...

	Staple  his  mouth  to  the tail-pipe of your BMW, and put a piece of
tape  across  his nose, then drive about 20 miles at top-speed, by this time,
his  mouth  should  be  enmeshed with the tail-pipe, his knuckles, knees, and
feet  will be practically non-existent from dragging on the ground, and he'll
be quite dead from inhaling all that carbon monoxide...
	Make  concrete  blocks  out of his hands, then hang him from a bridge
across  a  not  too  well travelled road, by his feet.  Set him swinging, and
wait for the next truck or van...

	Hang  him  spread-eagle off a diving board, with a weight tied around
his stomach.  if the board is low enough, you should be able to bounce up and
down on the board, and watch him drown slowly...

	Tie  a  rope  around  his  neck straight up to the top of a sail on a
sail boat,  and  strap his feet to the floor, straight in the middle of the
boat.   Every time the sail comes around, it should hit him quite hard in the
head.  I recommend this only for very windy days...

	Use him as a marker in a giant slalom ski race...

	Slide  razor  blades  across his back for about 20 minutes, then give
him the choice of shooting himself in the head, or being thrown in a bath-tub
full of gin...

	Tie him up spread eagle in front of a pitching machine, in such a way
that the tip of his nose is about 2 inches away from the barrel...

	Tie  him  up,  and handcuff him.  Then put his fingers in between the
type-  head  of  an  old-fashioned typewriter, and the paper.  You might like
typing out your opinions of him, while he suffers...

	Take a pair of handcuffs and put them on his feet. Then strap a rope
between them, so you hold on to the rope. Go on space mountain in disney-
land, and drag him off the back. If you get tired or scared, just let go,
it's only 80 or 90 feet down to the concrete...

	Steal all the jacks at the indy 500, and use him as a replacement...

	If he happens to be a sadist, pluck off his arms and legs, just as he
probably did to flies...

	String up his locker, so that when he opens it up, a mouse trap snaps
out and grabs him by the you-know-what...

	Bury him standing up 8 feet deep in sand, then make a wider area
around his head about 2 feet deep. Pry his eyes open with something
(preferably infectious) and pour in salt. Then let in six rats, and watch
them gouge out his eyes for food...

	Tie rubber-bands around his ankles (really strong and long ones must
be used for this, about 10 feet long) and go up on top of a high dive, that
is shorter than the somewhat extended length of the rubber-bands. Use him as
a yo-yo...

	String him out across the track at the next summer olympics right
before the mens 100 meter dash, in place of the ribbon...

	Get all dressed up in a radiation suit, and drive out to three mile
island or some other nuclear test that failed its' safety test. Find a huge
vat of anything that looks dangerous, is boiling, or is made of a colour
nature never knew existed. Then grab him by the ankles (like achilles'
mother did) and dunk him in it for about 10 minutes...

	I just ran out of ideas. If you got offended by this tough shit it's
a joke and if you don't think it's funny then screw you. If you have any
more ideas, leave me mail.

(Part II..)

	Ok... you guys must be pretty sick, cause a lot of you like that
first one, so as i promised, here's another...

	Give him a front row view of the launching of the space shuttle,
from right under the launching pad...

	When toast gets stuck in the toaster, use a few of his fingers to get
it out (this would work better if it were left plugged in and on hi temperature)

	Fly  over  the empire state building in a helicopter. Tie a 3/8 inch
rope around his ankle, and hold him so that his eye is strait above the radio
antenna. Tell him he can come back in if the rope holds for at least 2
hours. Then light up a cigarette, and ash it on the rope.


11.23     Born to Kill - The Art of Assassination (Part I)

Author: Jack The Ripper (OC)
From: Phile #3 of P/HUN Magazine Issue #5

       This is a series solely written from pure genius.  You will not find
the methods outlined here in any book or any other publication. They are for
informational purposes only, and are not to be used. The method I will outline
here will consist of two parts. The first part is the construction of a lethal
injection device. The second part will discuss how to turn this device into a
totally harmless looking device that kills quickly, silently, and effectively.

Construction of a Lethal Injection Device 
------------------------------------------

Materials Needed
----------------

Deadly Toxin i.e. air, cyanide, etc... (no specifics are outlined)
Larger syringe if superimpostition is needed.
5 cc or less size syringe with a 3/4 inch needle if unavailable superimpose.
a syringe that's body fits loosely in an emptied cigarette.
Superglue if superimposition is needed.
Cigarette Pack 100's preferably

Preparing the Syringe
---------------------

1) Totally disassemble the syring you will be working with the two parts.
    mainly

2) Skip if needle is 3/4's of an inch.  Break the needle off of the larger 
   syringe.  Now place glue around the base of the smaller syringes needle not
   much just a dab or two.  Place the larger needle over the smaller needle 
   so that it extends it out to the full 3/4's of an inch.  

3) cut the length of the syringe (the body only! not including the needle)
   down to 1 and 1/2 of an inch with a hacksaw so as to make a clean cut.

4) Now take the push stick or the handle of the syringe and cut off the tip
   of it, and cut the body down so that it is 1 and 1/2 inch's long.

5) What you should have now is a push stick that is 1 and 1/2 inchs long and
   fits just inside the syringe which is 1 and 1/2 inchs long, and a needle
   that is 3/4's of an inch long.  The whole contraption should be 3 and 
   3/4's of an inch enough to fit in a 100 cigarette easily.

Preparing the cigarette
-----------------------

1) Remove the filter from the cigarette by twisting it off, and then throw the
   long part of the cigarette away.  The paper should extend about 1/4 of an 
   inch from the filter, and try not to rip it.  The paper normally extends 
   a little bit naturally.

2) Take your tweesers and pick out the filter from the inside of the cigarette
   leaving a little bit about 1/4 inch of the filter to cover the end of the 
   cigarette.

3) Now take another cigarette and tear off the long part, and empty out the 
   tobacco saving it for later. 

4) Now you should have an empty hollow cigarette shell.  A bored out filter
   with 1/4 of an inch of the ending left on.

5) Now glue the long hollow part of the cigarette back to the filter and let
   it dry.

Arming the Contraption
----------------------

1) Now place the toxin into the body of the syringe with the needle on it of
   course.

2) Place the pushstick over it extended.

3) Place the setup into the cigarette with the back of the push stick touching
   the filter.  

4) Fill the remaining space of the cigarette with the leftover tobacco.

How to Use
----------

1) Light the cigarette since the needle end will be filled with a good portion
   roughly 1 minute 15 seconds of burning tobacco. 

2) Walk by the victim and burn him/inject him by pushing down on the filter of
   the armed cigarette.

3) The victim will think it was just a cigarette burn call you an idiot and 
   walk away.

Notes
-----

1) You might have to experiment with the lengths to get it just right.

2) Only use 1 cc or less of toxin or the victim might notice that something
   funny is going on before he dies.

3) Test it before you use it.  Cigarettes are a dime a dozen.

4) Never throw it away near the site.

5) Destroy it after it's use since plastic melts this is easy then throw it
   in a gutter or a junkyard.

6) Be careful not to scrape yourself.

7) The burn will take care of the pain, so he/she shouldn't notice a thing.

8) There will most likely be an inquest especially when normal people just drop
   dead and die.

9) Try to use slow acting 15-30 minute toxins that are lethal in small doses.

Toxins for Use
--------------

1) The Simplest toxin to use is air.  An air bubble in the brain causes death  
 and there is no way in hell a coroner can detect foul play unless he is

11.24     Assasination Made Easy

Author: GaRBlED UsEr


PART I:  The Beginning

	Ok. So theres this guy who stole yer girlfriend, or beat up yer
little sister, or something to that effect. What goes through you mind first?

-Not WHY, not WHEN, not IF... But rather HOW should I kill him?

	Well, you could beat him up...naw...unoriginal. Plus you MIGHT get hurt!
You could get yer 5 best friends, and beat him up. Nope, makes ya look wimpy.

	Well.. only one option left.. Assasinate him!

	How you say.. Well.. In the next few parts.. I'll tell you.. But Before
I do.. READ the eleven commandments of Revenge!


11.25 The Eleven Commandments of Revenge

			=========================

			:   UNTO OTHERS by      :
			:    George Hayduke     :
			=========================

!) Thou shalt not leave evidence lying around, however circumstantial.


PART II:  The Hunt

	Well, you know his name...that's a start.  Now, as around about him. BE 
DISCREET!! Only ask CLOSE freinds.. or just kinda slip it into a conversation.. 
and sit back while people tell you all about him (especially his enemies!)

	Grab yerself a phone book.. Hopefully, you have a ROUGH idea where he 
lives..  Look him up.. and try to narrow it down. Ex- Yer huntin down a kid 
named Ralph Norwieg.. Well.. look up Norwieg.. WHAT?!! 30 entries.. Hmm..  he 
lives SOMEWHERE in liverpool.. that leaves 10.. Now call em all, and ask for 
Ralph, you should end up with one or 2..  with luck.. you can figure out which 
is him just by his voice.. Or a "POLL". "Excuse me, how many high school 
students live here?, and thier names?" (that one ALLWAYS works..)

	Now you know his Phone # and address... Now.. start planning...

Step I: The LIE.

   Be REAL nice to him.. make friends with him, tell him everything is
   forgiven.. Have one of your friends threaten him, when they do.. jump in
   to "save the day". This will earn you his trust.

Step II: The PLAN!

   Now.. First you need to decide an assasination method.. Hmm.. you could:
        -Poison his food
        -Blow his house up
        -Blow his car up
              O R
  Kill him (NOT advised.. VERY dangerous!!!)


	Ok.. Lets say you decide to poison his food.. Now, grab a vial of yer 
FAVOURITE biotoxin, and eat lunch with him someday. Take him up to McDonalds..  
Ask him "Tell me what you want, My treat.. just go find a table" You order his 
shit, and when NOBODY is looking, dump the little vial (MAKE SURE it is a 
POWERFUL poison.. so that it does NOT take much to KILL!!!) onto his food.  
Now.. This is VERY important.. Eat with him.. make sure HE gets the poisoned 
food(duh!) Don't act all jittery, or scared.. just act natural. Start a 
conversation even..  Sooner or later, the poison gets to him.. Now this is VERY 
IMPO!!!!  Say ,no, YELL "OH MY GOD!! Ralph? Ralph?" (start shaking his sholder) 
"QUICK!  Somebody call an ambulance!!, RALPH..  SPEAK TO ME!!,, Oh my god.. He 
didn't deserve to die" Make sure you show up at the funeral.. Cry alot.. bring 
lotsa flowers.. The cops will NEVER suspect you.. AND DONT brag about it!! Ya 
gotta act like yer best freind just died.. You even show the SLIGHTEST sign of 
hatered towards him.. yer toast.  Even better, Use botulism.. WHy? IF it's a
relative of yours, you can sue McDonalds while yer at it!!

   Don't like the poisoning idea eh? Well.. what was next on that list? OH 
Yeah.. Blow his house up.

   First off.. Timing is EVERYTHING.. You blow up his house while he's at 
school.. and, well.. that's just stupid. Actually.. The best thing to do is, 
call him up on the night of the bomb.. Ask him if he's doing anything that 
night. Talk to him.. blah blah blah. Keep the putz on the fone till he goes to 
bed. Then.. begin your plan.

	Point A. The more people who know what yer doing.. the bigger chance
of a wimpout or a rat. Keep it to a FEW trusted freinds. 3 is a MAXIMUM!

	Point B.  Hit about 2am. Give yourself enough time to be a couple
miles away when it goes off, an alabi helps.

	That should do it. Basically, Plant the bomb in a way you KNOW it will
hit him. If his room is in the back of the house.. don't plant the bomb on the 
porch! Plant the devise AS NEAR TO HIM AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN!!! Even if it's enof 
explosives to blow up a city block. The only stupid assasin, is the one who is 
overconfident. Make sure you use a timer, you want an hour or two to get the 
hell away. Unless you intend to use a lightbulb, or sodacan.. or similar device.
Follow these steps..and the basic rules of non-stupidity(threats are DEFINATELY 
OUT!) and you will have done a good deed for society.. the destruction of 
another dork.

	So, the putz has a car eh? Well this one is SIMPLE! Simply get yourself
a nice fused explosive. Put it NEAR the passenger area of the car. tie the fuse
around the exaust manifold. And.. when your unsuspecting target drives to 
school.. he will hit the sky halfway down the highway.

Ain't Death Grand???!
Well.. this WONDERFUL file of destruction was brought to YOU by...

11.3     REVENGE

11.31      Revenge: Don't get mad - Get even
Subtitled: Fun Things To Do

From a book by George Hayduke
Written by the Ghost 2/21/85


	This isn't a death and Destruction file. I'm not telling losers how
to cause thermite reactions in chemistry class or make neeto pipe bombs to
blow up that guy who keeps bugging you. This is from a book by George
Hayduke. It describes a variety of ways to get back at people who cause you
distress. The book has contains a lot of tips on causing expensive damage to
"marks". Well, I picked the good ones. Ones that don't cause a lot of
expense, in currency that is. Well, I hope you enjoy. Get back at the
losers using the system. Sort of like piracy and phreaking.

	In a car with automatic transmission, switch the #1 and #8 wires on
the distributer cap. This will allegedly allow the car to operate in neutral
and Park, but the engine mysteriously dies in Drive.

	Castor Oil squirted into the tailpipe of a car, will cause a large
amount of smoke. Just the thing to help nervous drivers.

	If you can get a bank account number for a person, truly wonderful
things can happen. Depositing one penny every day can get the employees very
pissed.

	It happens that  given a few hundred wanted posters, one will look
like you. OR anybody else you can imagine. Close anyway. Think of all
the bounty hunters just waiting to claim  their reward.

	Place an ad in a paper for Male Secretarys only. $11 an hour, must be
physically attractive, gentle, and other related social traits. This is for
anybody who has an office. Give the time to show up one half hour before the
normal opening hour. For example, if the office opens at 9:00, put the time
to be 8:30. All these faggots will show up and start bitching  at  each other
and your loser.

	Run an ad in the local paper with  the following message.  "I need all
used christmas trees. Please leave them on my lawn, and I'll pay $5 for each
one." then leave the losers address. The paper will take your $ and print the
ad without thinking.

	If you  know the guy is going to throw a party, arrange for him to find
out that somebody was going to crash his party, dressed up like cops. Then
call the cops telling them of a real rowdy party going on.

	If your college uses computers to handle admissions, try this. Fill
out course withdrawl forms in the losers name. Then enter them, they
probably won't check. The guy will go the entire block unknowing, then
 when grades are posted. "Where are mine?" "Why didn't I get grades?"

	Call your colleges administration, tell them you are the undertaker
of your losers hometown. He just died, please take him off your records,
records will follow. Then call the parents.  He just died in a fraternity
accident. This will work better if the guy decides to  skip a week or so of
classes. 
 
	Instead of credit card fraud, just call up the company and tell them
that you just lost your cards. You name? Why it's (insert loser)

	If you want, advertise the losers phone number as a Dial A Joke. For
bigots, Dial A Black, etc.

	If you dislike a fast food place with a  drive thru, try this. Order
everything you can think of. Then just don't go to the window.  Do it during
dinner hours.  Or, order a normal sized meal, but  with  extra  helpings  of
mustard.  Then the next car will try the food, then  freak  out  at  the joint.

	Automatic garage door openers have dip switches that can be changed to
 other combinations. The cheaper the model, the better. Sears sells just
the unit. Say you broke yours or something.  Then change  the settings.

	Wax crayons tossed into a wash do wonders to whites or anything else.

There is a whole section of phun things to do with a phone:

	Call in a bomb  threat to a school or something, then leave the
handset offhook. Of course, do this only at the losers house. Someone will
visit.

	Call Ma Bell, and report  that your loser is using Blue Boxes.  Tell
them it is your civic duty... Don't do this to someone who knows what theyu
are though. The phone co doesn't believe in innocence.

	Ads placed in papers saying that (insert loser) will sell YOU! the plans
to a device enabling inexpensive calls. Mention that you keep no records.

	If you are getting back at somebody with a multi-line system, this is
good. Place a large magnet where the line comes in. When one phone rings, they
all do.

	If you can get a private minute with your marks phone, and the handset
is modular, cover the handset plug with clear nail polish. The phone rings,
then its unlimited "Hello?" "Hello?".

	Remove the pins from all but one of the hinges of a front door of a
business. The door will work fine, for a while, then fall off.  People start
screaming.

	Add  luminescent  paint into the cans of someone who is painting their
fence. Then,  at  night,  it  glows. 

	Get  some copper paint and paint a small line across  the  insulator
of a spark plug in a car.  They'll never find it.

	If your loser gets a parking ticket, get it before he sees it. Then get
a stamp flicking  the  cops  off. Send it in with no money.

	If you dislike a pet hater, here's one. Advertise that you (the loser)
would like to buy all unwanted strays. $10 for each one. Then call the SPCA,
telling them that the loser wants the animals to conduct black masses and pagan
rites.

	Laxatives slipped into dogfood does wonders.  Or better yet, toss some
normal meat into the dog-owners yard. Then call him up (in a disguised voice)
and tell him you saw a suspicious person hanging around the yard.

	Mail a letter to the Chief Executive detailing the sexual acts you (the
loser) would like to commit, the Secret Service investigates this with no
humour.

	PA systems in department stores are great. Just walk up to a deserted
unit, look around, then deliver the most disgusting statement you can think of.

	Call about thirty people, telling them they just won a sweepstakes.
Answer the questions, no obligation, it's just to show how generous people are.
Then give the losers phone number to call for more info.

	Remember two things, hot metal and hot glass do not look different
from cool. (as long as it's not too hot)

	Western Telegram has a check on everything going through. Certain key
words trip alarms. Guns, Drugs, Sex, Terrorist, etc all ring bells.

Have fun


11.32     How to get Revenge on Someone

Authors: Black Fire and Capt. Cloner


	Everyone has an enemy that they would like to seek revenge on without
the victim knowing who the aggressor is. Here are ways that have been proven
effective in the field of harrasing and/or annoying someone.

	Call the news papers, and adverise an arctile similar to this:  "You
too can make calls free through MCI, ITT, and other long distance services
just by making a local call. For more information, send a self-adressed
stamped envlope to:(fill in name and adress with zip code)" After this has
appeared in the papers, inform your local FBI agent or police officer of his
ad. You can also advertise an ad like this: "Apple //e, 128k, 2 disk
drives, Amdek Color 3 Monitor, Hayes Smartmodem 1200, and much more. $750 or
best offer. (phone number)".

	Another prank  is to call house at all hours, and post on all boards
that a new bulletin board is opening up at his number. Get everyone you know
to call him at all times (preferably late at night. Call answering machines,
and give the persons number and tell them to call right away. Also during
the day you can look up people in the phone that have a "Mr. and Mrs."
there, and the wife will probably be home, but not the husband, so tell the
wife to tell the husband to call your victim as soon as possible and give
number. Call Taxi's, Exterminators, Pizza deliverys, Catorers, Garages,
Plumers, Dog Funeral Homes, Flower and Ballon deliverys, Moving Services,
Singing and Striptease telegrams, Junkyards to remove garbage, report
robberies and fires at his/her house, Locksmiths, order oil from several
companies (heating oil), order family portraits taken at their home, sign
him/her up for the army, call realtors to put house for sale, Septic
cleaners, house remodelers, call Bell + tell you are having with phone, call
cable company, and call phone sex lines that call back and give his number to
call back. Order plane tickets, send brochures of all shit like colleges,
beauty schools, and all other things that send info. on their place, and
adress it to: "DICK" and his last name.

	To have a little phun, drop by his house one day, tie a chain to the
back of you truck/car and the other end to the victims mailbox. Take off,
and no more mailbox. Also, throw eggs at house and cars, piss on cars and is
gas tank of cars. Get 300 sheets+ of paper and put in a paper shreader and
after it is in 1" by 1" pieces, throw all over his lawn in various places.
Another fun thing is to bring along a baseball bat and knock the shit out of
his mailbox. Send mail with not enough postage to them, and wrap up bricks
and rocks and put no  return adress on them and drop in a mailbox.  Get a
library card out in his name, and take out books and don't return them. Lay
tacks on either side of tires of his car so either way he will run over them.
Take weed killer, and pour it on his flower garden or put your initials on
his front yard with it so it will show up with dead grass. You can also use
the old trick of laying dog shit on his front porch. Pour grease all over
driveway and steps, dump your garbage cans over front yard, when he puts his
garbage at the end of the driveway, dump the cans over the street so he will
have to pick it up in the morning. Smear warm tar on his car windshield, and
that shit isn't coming off. Crazy Glue or stick gum over and in his car
locks, and if he goes to school do the same to his locker. Catch fish, and
let them sit out in the sun for a day, and that night lay the fish in their
front yard. Lay cow shit in their air conditioner, and stick sticks in the
between the fan blades for the air conditioner. The toilet paper around
their trees is always good, and wet toilet paper and stand out in the street
and whip them at their house, and when it dries, it is hard as rock stuck to
their house. If they leave toys out, stick skate- boards under car tires,
rip heads off of dolls, pull seats out bikes, and let air out of bike tires.
You can also ride by in  the  car  with your BB gun, and try your target
practice. Some of this has been tried, and some not, but remember that it is
best to be near them when these happen, so you can see their faces.  Never
hint who you are, and warn that you are not finshed yet. The best weapon you
have is your phone, because they can't keep their phone off the hook 24 hrs.
a day. If they take the phone off the hook, try back in 1/2 hour, and it
will be back on. Most of these have been proven effective, and the others
will most likely effective. We have sat here for hours thinking of every
possible method of harrasing, bothing, and annoying someone to the point of
insanity. This has been written by Black Fire with the help of Captain
Cloner. We will be writing more as soon as more ideas are tested. You will
be hearing more from us. Have fun, and remember this is only a game!



11.4    CREATING A NEW IDENTITY

11.41     False Identification
                             
Author:     Forest Ranger
From: ==Phrack Inc.== Volume One, Issue Four, Phile #3 of 11

	The objective of this file is to teach one to change his or her
current drivers license to make one 21, without taking apart the drivers
license itself. This will be taught to you in a quick, inexpensive, easy to
understand process. The materials used are laminated sheets (easily
obtainable from a school supply store for around a dollar to two dollars
for a number of sheets), pair of good scissors, and a copy machine.

	The first step in the process calls for the copy machine (a copy
machine at the supermarket works good). Make two copies of your drivers
license. Take one copy and search for a digit on one of the copies that
will change the current year on your license to one that will change your
age (21). Once you have found the digit on one copy cut it out so just the
digit is there (a square segment with a little trim around the edges is a
good cut). Then take the other copy and cut out the current last digit of
the year you were born in basically the same shape as the last. Put the cut
out digit under the copy that you had cut out your current digit of the
year you were born. Now having a little trim around the cut out digit from
the first copy will assist you when lining it up under the second copy when
you put it in the copy machine. Now that you have the new digit from the
first copy sitting underneath but showing on the second copy place it in
the copy machine and make a copy so that you will have an original of the
new base part of the license.

	Now since most copy machines are black and white you will have to
cut away the states license on the top of the license (e.g. Illinois
License). Now place the new base of the license with the cut away license
name over the old base of the current license. The new base might not match
up like it should but line it up as a good as possible. Now place a piece
of the laminated sheet cut out to configure the license on top of the new
base. Cut away any overlaps of laminated paper and iron over the license
with Mom's good old iron.

Note:

	This process has been proved to work. If you are the type of person
that looks very young then do not bother to make an ID. You will just get
caught and get into a lot of trouble. Also, be very careful at well known
bars and over 21 hang out spots. The employees at these places tend to
flash a flash light underneath the card to see if it is transparent. It is
supposed to be.  With this process it is a little hard to see through the
ID so be careful with it if you do go to a place such as this. If you are
pulled over by the police then take a corner of the license and rip. It
will not affect your original license though it maybe a little sticky but,
that should not be to big of a problem. If any bubbling occurs just iron
over it and flatten.


11.42    How To Create A New Indentity

Author: The Walking Glitch
Courtesy of: The Jolly Roger

	You might be saying, "Hey Glitch, what do I need a new identity
for?" The answer is simple. You might want to go buy liquor somewhere,
right? You might want to go give the cops the false name when you get
busted so you keep your good name, eh? You might even want to use the new
identity for getting a P.O. Box for carding. Sure! You might even want the
stuff for renting yourself a VCR at some dickless loser of a convenience
store. Here we go:

	Getting a new ID isn't always easy, no one said it would be. By
following these steps, any bozo can become a new bozo in a coupla weeks.

STEP 1

	The first step is to find out who exactly you'll become. The most
secure way is to use someone's ID who doesn't use it themselves.  The
people who fit that bill the best are dead. As an added bonus they don't go
complaining one bit. Go to the library and look through old death notices.
You have to find someone who was born about the same time as you were, or
better yet, a year or two older so you can buy booze, etc. You should go
back as far as you can for the death because most states now cross index
deaths to births so people can't do this in the future. The cutoff date in
Wisconsin is 1979, folks in this grand state gotta look in 1978 or earlier.
Anything earlier there is cool. Now, this is the hardest part if you're
younger.

	Brats that young happen to be quite resilient, takin' falls out of
three story windows and eating rat poison like its Easter candy, and not a
scratch or dent. There ain't many that die, so ya gotta look your ass off.
Go down to the library and look up all the death notices you can, if it's
on microfilm so much the better. You might have to go through months of
death notices though, but the results are well worth it. You gotta get
someone who died locally in most instances: the death certificate is filed
only in the county of death. Now you go down to the county courthouse in
the county where he died and get the death certificate, this will cost you
around $3-$5 depending on the state you're in. Look at this hunk of paper,
it could be your way to vanish in a clould of smoke when the right time
comes, like right after that big scam. If You're lucky, the slobs parents
signed him up with social security when he was a snot nosed brat. That'll
be another piece of ID you can get. If not, thats ok too. It'll be listed
on the death certificate if he has one. If you're lucky, the stiff was born
locally and you can get his birth certificate right away.

STEP 2

	Now check the place of birth on the death certificate, if it's in
the same place you standing now you're all set. If not, you can mail away
for one from that county but its a minor pain and it might take a while to
get, the librarian at the desk has listings of where to write for this
stuff and exactly how much it costs. Get the Birth cirtificate, its worth
the extra money to get it certified because thats the only way some people
will accept it for ID. When yur gettin this stuff the little forms ask for
the reason you want it, instead of writing in "Fuck you", try putting in
the word "Geneology". They get this all the time. If the Death certificate
looks good for you, wait a day or so before getting the certified birth
certificate in case they recognize someone wanting it for a dead guy.

STEP 3

	Now your cookin! You got your start and the next part's easy.
Crank out your old Dot matrix printer and run off some mailing labels
addressed to you at some phony address. Take the time to check your phony
address that there is such a place. Hotels that rent by the month or large
apartment buildings are good, be sure to get the right zip code for the
area. These are things that the cops might notice that will trip you up.
Grab some old junk mail and paste your new labels on them. Now take them
along with the birth certificate down to the library. Get a new library
card. If they ask you if you had one before say that you really aren't sure
because your family moved around alot when you were a kid. Most libraries
will allow you to use letters as a form of ID when you get your card. If
they want more give them a sob story about how you were mugged and got your
wallet stolen with all your identification. Your card should be waiting for
you in about two weeks. Most libraries ask for two forms of ID, one can be
your trusty Birth Certificate, and they do allow letters addressed to you
as a second form.

STEP 4
    
	Now you got a start, it isn't perfect yet, so let's continue. You
should have two forms of ID now. Throw away the old letters, or better yet
stuff them inside the wallet you intend to use with this stuff. Go to the
county courthouse and show them what nice ID you got and get a state ID
card. Now you got a picture ID. This will take about two weeks and cost
about $5, its well worth it.

STEP 5

	If the death certificate had a social security number on it you can
go out and buy one of those metal SS# cards that they sell.  If it didn't,
then you got all kinds of pretty ID that shows exactly who you are. If you
don't yet have an SS#, Go down and apply for one, these are free but they
could take five or six weeks to get, Bureaucrats you know... You can invent
a SS# too if ya like, but the motto of 'THE WALKING GLITCH' has always been
"Why not excellence?".

STEP 6

	If you want to go whole hog you can now get a bank account in your
new name. If you plan to do alot of traveling then you can put alot of
money in the account and then say you lost the account book. After you get
the new book you take out all the cash. They'll hit you with a slight
charge and maybe tie-up your money some, but if you're ever broke in some
small town that bank book will keep you from being thrown in jail as a
vagrant.

ALL DONE?

	So kiddies, you got ID for buying booze, but what else? In some
towns (the larger the more likely) the cops if they catch you for something
petty like shoplifting stuff under a certain dollar amount, will just give
you a ticket, same thing for pissing in the street. Thats it! No
fingerprints or nothing, just pay the fine (almost always over $100) or
appear in court. Of course they run a radio check on your ID, you'll be
clean and your alter-ego gets a blot on his record. Your free and clear.
Thats worth the price of the trouble you've gone through right there. If
your smart, you'll toss that ID away if this happens, or better yet, tear
off your picture and give the ID to someone you don't like, maybe they'll
get busted with it. If you're a working stiff, here's a way to stretch
your dollar. Go to work for as long as it takes to get unemployment and
then get yourself fired. Go to work under the other name while your
getting the unemployment. With a couple of sets of ID, you can live like a
king. These concepts for survival in the new age come to you compliments
of THE WALKING GLITCH.  First release of this phile 7/7/88.


11.5     SURVEILLANCE and INVESTIGATION


11.51     The Art of Investigation

Author: The Butler  10/31/90
From: ==Phrack Classic== Volume Three, Issue 32, File #4 of 12

	There are many ways to obtain information about individuals. I am
going to cover some of the investigative means of getting the low down on
people whom you wish to know more about.

Some of the areas I will cover are:

Social Security Checks
Driving/Vehicular Records
Police Reports
FBI Records
Insurance Records
Legal Records
Credit Bureau Checks
Probate Records
Real Estate Records
Corporate Records
Freedom Of Information Act
Governmental Agency Records
Maps
Tax Records

	To obtain information from some organizations or some individuals
one must be able to "BULLSHIT"!!! Not only by voice but in writing. Many
times you must write certain governmental bodies requesting info and it can
only be done in writing. I can't stress enough the need for proper grammer
and spelling.

	For you to obtain certain information about another person you must
first get a few KEY pieces of info to make your investigation easier. The
persons Full Name, Social Security Number, Date & Place of Birth will all
make your search easier and more complete.

	First of all in most cases you will know the persons name you want
to investigate. If not you must obtain it any way you can. First you
could follow them to their home and get their address. Then some other
time when they are gone you could look at their mail or dig through their
trash to get their Full Name. While in their trash you might even be able
to dig up more interesting info like: Bank Accout Numbers, Credit Card
Numbers, Social Security Number, Birth Day, Relatives Names, Long Distance
Calls Made, etc.

	If you can't get to their trash for some reason take their address
to your local library and check it against the POLKS and COLES Directories.
This should provide you with their Full Name, Phone Number, Address, and
how long they have lived at the current location.

	You can also check the Local Phone Book, Directory Assistance, City
Directories, Post Office, Voter Registration, Former Neighbors, Former
Utilities (water, gas, electric, phone, cable, etc.)

	If you know someone who works at a bank or car dealer you could
have them run a credit check which will reveal all of their credit cards
and if they have ever had any late payments or applied for any loans. If
you are brave enough you could even apply for a loan impersonating the
individual under investigation.

	The Credit Bureau also has Sentry Services that can provide
deceased social security numbers, postal drop box address and known
fraudulent information.

	You can get an individuals driving record by sending a letter to
your states Department of Revenue, Division of Vehicles. You can also get
the following:

Driver Control Bureau
For Driving Record send Name, Address, Date of Birth and usually a $1 process-
ing fee for a 5 year record.

Titles & Registration Bureau
For ownership information (current and past).

Driver License Examination Bureau
To see what vision was rated.

Motor Carrier Inspection & Registration Bureau
To check on licensing and registration of trucks/trucking companies.

Revocation Dept
Can verify if someone's driver's license has ever been suspended or revoked.

	You can even obtain a complete vehicle history by sending the
vehicle description, identification # for the last registered owner, and
a small fee. Send this info to your states Dept of Vehicles. It is best to
contact them first to get their exact address and fees. I would advise
using a money orders and a P.O. Box so they cannot trace it to you without
a hassle.

Police Records

	All Police and Fire Records are Public record unless the city is
involved. You can usually get everything available from the police dept
including: Interviews, maps, diagrams, misc reports, etc.


FBI Records

	If the individual you are inquiring about is deceased the FBI will
provide some info if you give them Full Name, SSN, Date & Place of Birth.
Contact you local FBI office to get the details.


Real Estate Records

	Recorder of Deeds offices in each county maintain land ownership
records. Most are not computerized and you have to manually search. Then
you must review microfilm/fiche for actual deeds of trust, quit claim
deeds, assignments, mortgage, liens, etc.

	A title company can run an Ownership & Equity (O&E) search for a
fee ($80-$100) which will show ownership, mortgage info, easements, taxes
owned, taxes assessed, etc.

	Most county assessors will provide an address and value of any real
property if you request a search by name.


Social Security Records

Social Security Administrator
Office of Central Records Operations
300 North Greene Street
Baltimore, Maryland 21201
301-965-8882

	Title II and Title XVI disability claims records, info regarding
total earnings for each year, detailed earnings information show employer,
total earnings, and social security paid for each quarter by employer.

Prices are approximately as follows:

1st year of records                        $15.00
2nd-5th year of records                    $ 2.50 per person
6th-10th year of records                   $ 2.00 per person
11th-15th year of records                  $ 1.50 per person
16th-on year of records                    $ 1.00 per person

**  Call for verification of these prices.  **

	Social Security records are a great source of information when
someone has been relatively transient in their work, or if they are
employed out of a union hall.

	If you want to review a claim file, direct your request to the
Baltimore office. They will send the file to the social security office in
your city for you to review and decide what you want copies of.

	The first three digits of a social security number indicate the
state of application.

The Social Security Number
		 

	SSA has continually emphasized the fact that the SSN identifies a
particular record only and the Social Security Card indicates the person
whose record is identified by that number. In no way can the Social
Security Card identify the bearer. From 1946 to 1972 the legend "Not for
Identification" was printed on the face of the card. However, many people
ignored the message and the legend was eventually dropped. The social
security number is the most widely used and carefully controlled number in
the country, which makes it an attractive identifier.

	With the exception of the restrictions imposed on Federal and some
State and local organizations by the Privacy Act of 1974, organizations
requiring a unique identifier for purposes of controlling their records are
not prohibited from using (with the consent of the holder) the SSN. SSA
records are confidential and knowledge of a person's SSN does not give the
user access to information in SSA files which is confidential by law.

	Many commercial enterprises have used the SSN in various
promotional efforts. These uses are not authorized by SSA, but SSA has no
authority to prohibit such activities as most are not illegal. Some of
these unauthorized uses are: SSN contests; skip-tracers; sale or
distribution of plastic or metal cards; pocketbook numbers (the numbers
used on sample social security cards in wallets); misleading advertising,
commercial enterprises charging fees for SSN services; identification of
personal property.

	The Social Security Number (SSN) is composed of 3 parts,
XXX-XX-XXXX, called the Area, Group, and Serial.  For the most part, (there
are exceptions), the Area is determined by where the individual APPLIED for
the SSN (before 1972) or RESIDED at time of application (after 1972). The
areas are assigned as follows:

000     unused   387-399 WI    528-529 UT
001-003 NH       400-407 KY    530     NV

700-728 Railroad workers through 1963, then discontinued
729-899 unassigned, for future use
900-999 not valid SSNs, but were used for program purposes
	  when state aid to the aged, blind and disabled was
          converted to a federal program administered by SSA.

	As the Areas assigned to a locality are exhausted, new areas from
the pool are assigned. This is why some states have non-contiguous groups
of Areas.

	The Group portion of the SSN has no meaning other than to determine
whether or not a number has been assigned. SSA publishes a list every month
of the highest group assigned for each SSN Area. The order of assignment
for the Groups is: odd numbers under 10, even numbers over 9, even numbers
under 9 except for 00 which is never used, and odd numbers over 10. For
example, if the highest group assigned for area 999 is 72, then we know
that the number 999-04-1234 is an invalid number because even Groups under
9 have not yet been assigned.

	The Serial portion of the SSN has no meaning. The Serial is not
assigned in strictly numerical order. The Serial 0000 is never assigned.

	Before 1973, Social Security Cards with pre-printed numbers were
issued to each local SSA office. The numbers were assigned by the local
office. In 1973, SSN assignment was automated and outstanding stocks of
pre-printed cards were destroyed. All SSNs are now assigned by computer
from headquarters. There are rare cases in which the computer system can
be forced to accept a manual assignment such as a person refusing a number
with 666 in it.

	A pamphlet entitled "The Social Security Number" (Pub. No.05-10633)
provides an explanation of the SSN's structure and the method of assigning
and validating Social Security numbers.


Tax Records

	If you can find out who does the individuals taxes you might be
able to get copies from them with the use of creative social engineering.

	If you want to run a tax lien search there is a service called
Infoquest.  1-800-777-8567 for a fee.  Call with a specific request.


Post Office Records

	If you have an address for someone that is not current, always
consider writing a letter to the postmaster of whatever post office branch
services the zip code of the missing person. Provide them the name and the
last known address and simply ask for the current address. There might be a
$1 fee for this so it would be wise to call first.

City Directory, Polk's, Cole's, etc.

	Information in these directories is contained alphabetically by
name, geographically by street address, and numerically by telephone
number, so if you have any of those three pieces of info, a check can be
done. The Polk's directory also shows whether the person owns their home
or rents, their marital status, place of employment, and a myriad of other
tidbits of information. However, these books are not the be-all and
end-all of the information as they are subject to public and corporate
response to surveys. These directories are published on a nationwide basis
so if you are looking for someone outside of your area, simply call the
public library in the area you have an interest and they also can perform a
crisscross check for you.

	You can also call a service owned by Cole's called the National
Look up Library at 402-473-9717 and either give a phone number and get the
name & address or give the address and get the name and phone number. This
is only available to subscribers, which costs $183.00 dollars for 1991. A
subscriber gets two free lookups per day and everyone after that costs
$1.25. A subscriber can also mail in a request for a lookup to:

National Look Up Library
901 W. Bond Street

Freedom Of Information

	The Freedom of Information Act allows the public to request
information submitted to, or generated by, all executive departments,
military departments, government or government controlled corporations, and
regulatory agencies. Each agency, as described above, publishes in the
Federal Register, descriptions of its central and field organizations and
places where and how requests are to be directed. Direct a letter to the
appropriate person designated in the Federal Register requesting reasonably
described records be released to you pursuant to the Freedom of Information
Act. Be sure to follow each agency's individually published rules which
state the time, place, fees, and procedures for the provisions of
information.  The agency should promptly respond.

	How to Find Information About Companies, Ed. II, 1981, suggests,
"Government personnel you deal with sometimes become less helpful if you
approach the subject by threatening the Freedom of Information Act action -
it's best to ask for the material informally first." While this will
probably enable you to find the correct person to send your request to, be
prepared to spend at least half an hour on the phone talking to several
people before you find the person who can help you. The book also has a
brief description of what each governmental agency handles.

	If you want to see if someone you are trying to locate is a
veteran, has a federal VA loan, or receives some sort of disability
benefit, use Freedom of Information and provide the person's SSN.

	You will get a bill but you can ask for a fee waiver if this
contributes to a public understanding of the operation of the government.
You can also request an opportunity to go through the files yourself and
then decide what you want copied.


Insurance Records

	PIP carrier records (may contain statements, medical records, new
doctors/ hospital names, records of disability payments, adjuster's
opinions, applications for insurance coverage, other claim info, etc.)

	Health insurance records (may contain medical records, record of
bills, new doctors/hospital names, pre-existing conditions information,
info regarding other accidetns/injuries, etc.)

	Often you will have to go through the claims office, the
underwriting dept, and the business office to get complete records as each
individual dept maintains its own seperate files.


Workers Compensation

	Some states will let you simply request records. Just submit your
request including the SSN and Birthdate, to the Department of Human
Resources, Division of Worker's Compensation. They will photocopy the
records and send you the copies. Other states require an authorization to
obtain these records.


	You can always call your local Private Investigator pretending you
are a student doing a research paper on the methods of getting personal
information about people or even trash his place to find tips on tracking
down people.



11.52     The State of Surveillance

(Part One of a Series)

	I figured it was about time for an update on government and private
surveillance techniques and what you can do about them. First, we'll start off
with ways to spy, if you will. The all-time favorite technique seems to be
tapping the telephone in some way - whether it be from wiring your phone for an
infinity transmitter, wiring your junction box, induction tapping your wires, or
taps at the local CO, the phone line is one of the most commonly tapped items.
An infinity transmitter, aka a harmonica bug, has to be installed inside your
phone. It works by intercepting all calls into the house and looking for a tone
around the first ring. It then uses the microphone on the handset to pick up
what's going on inside the house, while the phone is on the hook. What the
person would do is call your house, and while the phone is ringing, he would
send a tone down through the line. You wouldn't hear that first ring because
the bug traps it, and he could listen to anything going on in the house. The
way to check for one of these is to either open up your phone or to call a tone
sweep, available in most areas. At a certain frequency, the bug would kick in
and your phone would start either ringing or making strange noises.

	Another popular technique is wiring junction boxes, aka pedestals
or cans. This is the large, 6 foot green box with the Bell logo on it with
1000 connections inside, or the small, 3 or 4 foot green box with the Bell
logo on it with 7 through 60 connections. These boxes contain rows of wire
pairs. Your adversary could open one of these up, find your wire pair with
an ANI, and hook up some sort of recording device or jumper cable to it.
In effect, it is like picking up an extension outside the building. The
way to detect it is to either look for a marked impedance drop on your
phone, notice that people sound softer, or go outside and find your
pedestal and examine it.

	The perennial inductance tap is a relatively secure tap - unless
you catch your 'bugger' outside near your phone wires doing strange things,
it's undetectable. Basically, a coil of wire and an amplifier are hooked
together and brought near your telephone wires somewhere -- he doesn't have
to splice them. Through the principles of electric induction, he can hear
everything said on that line. As I said, this bug is very hard to detect.

	And finally, perhaps the hardest bug to detect at all: the
telephone CO bug. If the Feds are really serious about tapping you, they
won't hook up crude-as-hell wiretaps -- they'll go to your local central
office and monitor your line from there. It is virtually undetectable if
done right; if done wrong, you have no way of proving they did it...

The next installment will cover non-telephone audio bugs.


State of Surveillance (pt. 2)

	This second installment covers non-telephone audio bugs.  First,
we'll start out with passive audio bugs, or bugs that don't need to
actively transmit a signal from the area being bugged. One such example is
the window-reflection laser bug, which consists of a laser being aimed at a
window pane in the room to be bugged. Since the laser emits a coherent
beam of light that (if unobstructed) can travel long distances, the actual
laser itself can be quite a distance away from the window to be bugged. It
works because sound creates very slight vibrations in the window glass, and
the laser beam is modulated or pulsed by the vibrating window. The beam is
then reflected back to a photodiode, an electronic part that detects these
vibrations. The electrical signal from the photodiode can then be
amplified and fed through some sort of listening device.  As for detecting
this type of bug, it is extremely hard to do so. Since the chances are
good that the laser is infrared, one way to detect it would be to use an
infrared detector card, readily available at your nearest Radio Shack for
about $5.95. After turning off the lights in the room, one would move the
card around the outside of the window in question and observing the card.
One way to counter the bug would be to generate an extremely high-frequency
sound, which would piss off all the dogs in your area but would probably do
a good job of countering the laser bug. Given a decent amount of
electronics experience, one could probably build one for under $20, but you
can buy one commercially that sticks on to the window w/ a suction cup for
about $900, last I checked.

	Another example in the history of passive audio bugs is the device
hidden in the American embassy in the Soviet Union in the '50s.
Apparently, the Soviets had placed a tuned resonant cavity with a diaphragm
and antenna inside a carefully-carved wooden presidential seal given as a
gift to a new American ambassador, who mounted it in his office
unknowingly. The Soviets aimed a high-power microwave beam at the antenna
(as a matter of fact, the beam was powerful enough to injure some embassy
personnel) and bounced it back to a receiver. The modulation of the beam
caused by hitting the antenna picked up the sound in the room. The
principle of the above two bugs is similar: if you have a substance that
can act as a diaphragm, or something that will vibrate when sound waves hit
it, you can bug it. A rather esoteric example invented in the '60s is going
up to the roof of the building to bug and lowering a microphone into the
toilet air pipe (no kidding). Since any sort of sound in the room would, of
course, vibrate the water, and then vibrate the air in the pipe, it should
actually work rather well. If the pipe is the right length, you might not
even need the microphone, due to the principles of open-air resonance. The
best way to counter this type of listener would be to simply go to the
bathroom, which would disturb the water and mask whatever sort of
conversation you're having in the bathroom. Probably not a bug that's used
often. An even easier type of bug to build is a parabolic mike; the same
principle is at work with satellite dishes. The dish focuses all the sound
rays that hit it onto the focal point, where a microphone is conveniently
located. Probably the best way to counter this type of bug would probably
be to have your discussion in a noisy area, preferably if the noise is
coming from a source near where the mike is pointed. However, some homebrew
parabolic mikes out there have the problem that when extremely loud noises
are encountered, the amplifier doesn't shut off, thereby blasting bloody
hell out of the would-be listener's ears.

	However, the most common audio bug is the bug that does not record
at all; it simply broadcasts the conversations to a receiver. There are an
incredible amount of cases involving this type of bug. The problem with
detecting this type of bug is that it can be incredibly small; I have
personally seen wafer-thin FM bugs that clip onto the top of a 9 volt
battery. This bug could transmit up to a half-mile, and could have been
quite easily hidden in a plant, or perhaps behind a piece of furniture. The
problem was that the bug transmitted over the FM radio band; any FM radio
could have picked it up. This is why nearly all radio bugs in
federal/commercial use today use frequencies that cannot be easily picked
up; some transmit in the gigahertz range around the microwave band, which
is quite beyond the range of most scanners. A good way to power this type
of bug is to install it into an electric socket or light switch and hook it
up to the power coming from the AC line. There is no really good way to
shut off this type of bug short of jamming their frequency (requiring you
to find the frequency it broadcasts on in the first place) or to shut off
their power source. A fascinating idea in making this type of bug literally
freak out is to aim a high-voltage stream of electrons at the bug; if the
bug is even remotely electronic and non-shielded, it should affect the bug
badly. But, this requires you to know the general location of the bug in
the first place, so... my idea, though, is that if the stream is powerful
enough, it should knock out the bug entirely, allowing you to do 'scans'
without needing to actually know there is a bug there in the first place.

	Interestingly enough, it is legal to record a conversation you are
having with someone else in a room if one of the two parties involved in
the conversation is doing the recording. Commercially-made tricks for
doing this include a cassette recorder small enough to fit somewhere else
on your body, such as in an inside suit pocket. A wire runs to your shirt
pocket, with the top half of a pen protruding from the pocket. Moving the
pen up or down turns on or off the recorder. A common government trick is
to hide the recorder in a briefcase; which is one way they bust big-time
drug and arms dealers. A good way to screw up a non-shielded recording bug
would be to generate an extremely powerful magnetic field in the area of
the tape, thereby erasing the tape. But if the government wants you badly
enough and the magnetic field wasn't all that strong, it is still possible
to reconstruct a tape full of magnetic dropouts. But, it is doubtful
whether such evidence would hold up in court.

	Also, if someone connects a recorder to the bug, it is not
necessary to have wires leading to it - a technique which can be used is to
buy a conductive-paint pen and literally draw the connections on. Look for
bright silver traces on whatever surface you are looking at; the problem
is, this type of trace can be easily painted over.

The next installment will cover video bugs.

State of Surveillance pt.3

	This third installment covers video bugs. First off, we'll start
with the video camera. Since walking around pointing shoulder-held video
cameras at people tends to be somewhat obvious, companies have made cameras
that are the size of matchboxes, being somewhere around an inch and a half
square. This is, of course, without power supply or tape. A neat trick for
observing people in rooms is to run a fiber optic cable through a lens or
two to the camera, and to run the other end through a pinhole in the wall.
In this way, the light from the room will enter the fiber optic cable and
be recorded on the other end by a camera, conveniently out of sight on the
other side of the wall. I've also been told about a fake car antenna that
has a similar pinhole and fiber optic assembly leading down to a camera and
transmitter under the antenna. The antenna rotates and sends a video image
to a briefcase with a receiver and a TV screen. It's supposedly used for
stakeouts.  Through fiber optics, one can mount the actual camera almost
anywhere.

	Another type of 'video bug,' in a way, is night-vision. There are
two major commercial approaches to night vision: infrared and image
amplification. Infrared vision can be accomplished in one of two ways:
active or passive. Active infrared vision consists of an infrared
flashlight and a camera or goggles that are sensitive to infrared light.
The subjects never know they're being watched, unless they have an
infrared-sensitive device. The best way to detect if you are being watched
by an active infrared camera is to buy an infrared detector card used for
testing remote controls, such as Radio Shack sells for $6.95. Assuming this
will be done in the dark, the card should fluoresce when hit by strong
infrared light.

	Passive infrared vision is a little bit more tricky. This type of
vision doesn't depend on an infrared light source; therefore, it is a lot
harder to detect. This system detects the differences in the amount of heat
given off by objects and translates it into a video image. As a side
benefit, these systems can be so sensitive that they can detect a handprint
up to five minutes after the subject has left, simply because of the heat
difference. Passive infrared can't be detected by the above-mentioned card.

	Image amplification is a technique used for amplifying the amount
of visible light incident on the goggles and turning it into a video image.
Along with passive infrared vision, image amplification is another
technique the United States military uses. As a matter of fact, image
amplification was used extensively in the so-called 'Desert Storm
conflict,' by forward scouts who needed to see in the dark.

	Another meaning of 'video bug' can be applied to TEMPEST equipment,
or what is sometimes called Van Eck phreaking. Video screens, computers,
'intelligent' keyboards (like those found on IBM/IBM compatibles) all send
out immense amounts of what most people regard as RF interference. However,
with the proper equipment, these signals can be picked up and read from as
far as one kilometer away. The defense against this, of course, is to
shield your computer from this type of emission. A few years ago, GRiD Inc.
(now part of Tandy) sold some TEMPEST-shielded computer equipment to the
Government, so you may wish to contact them.

	The next installment will cover miscellaneous other
counter-surveillance and personal-protection type items, and will
supposedly be the last.


11.6     COMBAT TECHNIQUES

11.61     Hand-To-Hand Combat

Author: [bad boy in black] 3/31/86
Mainly From: "The Marine Corps Field Manual on Physical Security"
Published in: ==Phrack Inc.==, Volume One, Issue Five, Phile #4 of 12


	This file will teach you how you can kill another person with your
own two hands. The information presented here will be very helpful to the
beginner and will also serve as a refresher for those of you already
familiar with the subject.

	I will start off by talking about basic things such as stance, what
you should and shouldn't do when fighting and other information that the
beginner will need to know. Then, I will give you a list of over 20
vulnerable points that one should always try attacking in a fight along
with the way these points should be attacked. Finally, I will give you some
more fighting tips and information on how you can continue learning about
hand-to-hand combat.


Now, let me discuss some of the basics you will need to know when you are in
any combat situation.

Stance:

	The best stance when confronting an enemy is to put your feet at
shoulders length apart and your arms should be facing forward, parallel to
each other and bent at the elbows. Keep your knees slightly bent and stand
on the balls of your feet.

	Remember, you always want to maintain this stance when you are not
striking at the enemy.

Balance:

	It is always important that you keep your balance. If you use the
stance I have described above, you will never have to worry about it. If by
chance you do lose your balance even for a second you can kiss your ass
goodbye as the enemy will probably kill you.

Aggressiveness:

	Always be aggressive and always attack. Don't just stand back and
defend yourself against the enemy's strikes as he will end up killing you
eventually.  If you are not aggressive, the enemy will think you are scared
and he will have an advantage over you.

	A great thing to do is yell at the enemy. This will scare the shit
out of him if you start yelling at him and plus it also allows you to get
more oxygen in your lungs so you will have more strength.

Natural Weapons:

	Your natural weapons are as follows: knife edge of either hand, the
heel of your hands, your fingers folded at the second knuckle, your boot,
your elbow, your knees, your teeth, your fore finger and second finger
forming a "V" shape, and your fist. These body parts alone are some of the
most powerful weapons you can use.

                                      ^*^

	Since you now know the basics of fighting, let me list for you the
best places where you should strike your enemy.

Temple:

	A sharp blow to the temple ensures instant death since there is a
large artery and nerve located close to the skin surface. If you give a
medium blow to the temple it will cause severe pain and concussion but a
hard blow will kill the enemy instantly. The best way to strike the temple
is with the knife edge of your hand or if he is on the ground you can kick
him with the toe of your boot.

Eyes:

	The eyes are a great place to strike if you can since a good strike
in the eyes will cause temporary or permanent blindness. To blind the
enemy, make a "V" shape with your fore finger and second finger and stick
them into his eyes while keeping your fingers stiff. Also, you can gouge
the eyes with your thumb.

Nose:

	The nose is another excellent place to attack. Hit the bridge with
the knife edge of your hand and you will cause breakage, severe pain,
temporary blindness and even death. Or you can use the palm of your hand to
strike upwards and push the nose up into his brain. If done hard enough the
nose bone will puncture his brain and he will die.

Upper Lip:

	The upper lip contains a lot of nerves close to the skin surface so
if you strike it with the knife edge of your hand it will cause great pain
and if delivered hard enough he will become unconscious.

Mouth:

	If the enemy is on the ground, use the heel of your boot and strike
him on the mouth. Since there are a lot of veins and arteries in the teeth
there will be a lot of blood which will frighten the enemy and he will lose
concentration on defending other parts of his body.

Chin:

	The chin should only be struck with the palm of your hand as you
can break your fingers on the enemy's chin. Use the palm of your hand and
strike the enemy with a very strong upward blow. This will cause extreme
discomfort.

Adam's Apple:

	Usually the enemy will defend this part of his body well but if you
do get the chance give it a sharp hit with the knife edge of your hand. If
you hit it hard enough you will bust his windpipe and he will die. You can
also squeeze the Adam's Apple between your fingers.

Esophagus:

	If you have a chance to get a hold of his neck, press your thumbs
into his esophagus (located below the Adam's Apple). Pushing hard will be
very painful and it will block the oxygen flow to his lungs and he will die
quickly.

Neck:

	If you give a very strong blow to the base of the neck with the
knife edge of your hand you will usually break it. However, if it is not
hard enough, the enemy might just be knocked unconscious so be sure to hit
him in the temple or twist his neck around to be sure he is dead. The neck
is the best place to hit someone if you want to be quiet as it is quick and
the enemy goes down without a word.

Collar Bone:

	The collar bone is an extremely sensitive part of the body. A sharp
blow to it with the knife edge of your hand or your elbow gives the enemy
excruciating pain. Also, digging your finger into the collar bone can bring
your enemy to his knees.

Shoulder:

	The shoulder is easy dislocated and it takes little strength to do.
However, it should be done quickly. Grab the enemy's arm and pull it behind
his back and then jerk it upwards quickly. You should here a popping sound
which means you have dislocated the enemy's shoulder. There are other
methods of doing this but this is the easiest.

Armpit:

	Although it is hard to get at, the armpit has a large network of
nerves. If the enemy is on the ground, hold up his arm and then kick him in
his pit. This will cause severe pain. However, it is not a very common
place that will be struck in a fight but is good to keep in mind anyways.

Rib Cage:

	A strike to the rib cage with your fingers folded at the second
knuckle is rather painful and if done hard enough causes severe pain and
breakage. Only use your fingers folded at the second knuckle since that
hurts the most.

Solar Plexus:

	The solar plexus is located on the chest at the little "V" shaped
point where the rib cage ends. There are a large amount of nerves so a blow
with the knuckle of your second finger can cause severe pain and even
unconsciousness.

Floating Ribs:

	The floating ribs are the lower ribs located at the front and sides
of the enemy's body. Use the knife edge of your hand or the heel or toe of
your boot.  The blow will cause pain and will stun the enemy.

Spine:

	A blow to the spine with the heel of your boot can paralyze or kill
your enemy. The lower spine between the enemy's kidneys is the best place
to hit as that is the least protected part of the spine. You will only be
able to attack the spine when your enemy is on the ground or if his back is
turned to you.

Kidneys:

	The kidneys have two large nerves that are close to the skin
surface. If you strike the kidneys hard it will cause death. You can use a
fist or the knife edge of your hand to hit the kidneys. Or a kick with the
heel of your boot will work too.

Groin:

	The groin is a good place to strike if you get the chance.
Generally, the enemy will protect this area the most but if you have a
chance, strike it with your knee in an upward motion or with your fist. I'm
sure you can imagine the pain the enemy will get from it.

Tailbone:

	The tailbone which is located above the anus is a very sensitive
part of the body as a lot of spinal nerves are located there. Use the toe
of your boot to strike the tailbone. The pain from that is unbelievably
severe.

Elbow:

	The elbow is easy to break or dislocate. Pull the enemy's arm
behind him and with the palm of your hand push his elbow inwards until it
either cracks or pops. When the enemy has a useless arm, you have a great
advantage over him.

Fingers:

	The fingers should be broken because the enemy becomes almost
helpless with broken fingers. Grab the enemy's arm with one hand and with
the other hand push the fingers upwards until they snap. It is only
necessary to break the first two fingers. It is also helpful in breaking a
grip.

Knee:

	You can destroy the knee by kicking it with the side of your boot
in an upward motion. This will rip the ligaments and the cartilage. This
will cause unbelievable pain and make it impossible for the enemy to move
around. Once a knee has been ruined, you will have a great advantage over
the enemy.

Ankle:

	If the enemy is on the ground, get a hold of his ankle and twist it
until it snaps. This will make it almost impossible for him to walk and he
will then be easy to kill.

                                      ^*^

	Let me talk about some more important things you should remember
when you are fighting somebody.


Tactics:

	Always try to throw your enemy off balance. You can do this by
charging the enemy and pretending to strike him. This will make him flinch
and lose his balance.

	Always look for a weak spot and attack it. Whenever he leaves a
vulnerable part of his body unprotected attack it with all your strength.
By doing this, he will then try to protect the part of his body that you
just struck thus leaving even more unprotected parts open.

	Use any available object that you can. By this I mean throw sand inS
his eyes, block his strikes by hitting him with a large branch, or any
other kind of available material that can be used as a weapon against him.


Foul Play:

	In a life or death situation there is no such thing as foul play
and there are no rules either. Although hitting someone in the groin is
considered a cheap shot in high school, it is a very effective way of
destroying your enemy. Just hit him where you can and kick him when he's
down. That way, he will never get back up again.

                                      ^*^

	I have now explained to you the basics of fighting and the best
places to attack your enemy on his body. Just because you have read this
file doesn't mean you will be able to go out and kick somebody's ass in.
These methods take a lot of practice in order to do them properly.

	If you enjoyed this file and would like to practice these methods
get a partner who is also interested in this and work on each type of
strike and kick. When you first start out, go slowly and remember that
these methods are deadly and do not require much force to be effective so
take it easy on your partner.

	Some of you may decide that practicing is not enough and you would
like to learn more than what I have told you in the above. Well, there are
several good books with illustrations on this subject which go into much
more detail than I ever could in this file. The book I used mainly to write
this file was "The Marine Corps Field Manual on Physical Security". You can
get this book through a good book store or if you happen to know a marine,
he can get you a copy very easily.

	There are also camps where you can go for 1-2 weeks to learn all
sorts of things like this such as firing weapons, detailed hand-to-hand
combat, doing raids on enemies and all sorts of other stuff like that. The
instructors that teach these programs are well trained and have had years
of experience with this. However, usually you have to be 18 years or older
to get into these programs and you have to be very serious about it as
well. This is not one of those programs where you can say "Time-out, I need
to rest." They don't stop just to suit you. To get more information about
these programs, you can usually find out about them in magazines like
"Soldier of Fortune" and other magazines with similar theme.

                                      ^*^

	Well, that's it for now. Perhaps in the future I can discuss the
fun stuff like fighting people with knives and all the other lethal weapons
you can use in a fight. If you liked this file, let me know and I will
continue on with this subject.

11.62     Jungle Survival
 
Author: Digital Destruction (604)
From: Activist Times Inc.
 
	Hello once again, ATI freaks, it's me again with some more hints to
get you through those pesky situations which always manage to mess up your
dinner reservations. This time, Jungle War Tactics.
      
	Has there ever been a time when you were taking a leisurely walk
through the Amazon jungle only to realize by way of a note pinned to a tree
by a spear that you were being stalked by headhunters? At that moment I'll
bet most of you said to yourselves 'Gee, I wish I knew some Jungle war
tactics!'. Well Here's the break youve been looking for.
 
Knife Trick:

	To kill your enemy by way of excruciatin pain, use this method.
Sharpen many hardwood sticks, and plant point-up in a patch of land on a
trail, for instance and cover in faeces. Then cover it all with leaves or
something and when Bongo and Umgala come after you, they will step on the
sticks, get driven into their feet (And if they fell their bodies), and if
that dont kill em then blood poisoning from the feces will.
 
Pond Trick:
 
	If you can find a very still pond, you can plant the sharp sticks
in this, but you dont have to, and then cover with grass, leaves etc. They
will think it is land and SPLOOSH.
 
	Well, those two tricks should do it. (I cant think of any more!) So
until next time, Hasta!
 


11.7     MISCELLANEOUS ANARCHY

11.71     Basic Anarchy

Angel, The Black Legend, LTD, Mind Bomb, Prince of Thieves, and to all
Anarchist out there.

 1.  Light the neighbor's tree(s) on fire.

     Simple. Make some napalm ( Gas and Palmolive <tm> in a can + an
     ammonia tablet which is to fall into it...), and put it under the
     tree...You'll have about 5 sec to run away, before the things
     transform into a fireball. You can light various things with
     napalm... Skunks, Rats, Skin Heads, Dog, Krishna, or your
     favorite ethnic minority specimen.

 2.  Smoke Show...

     Take about 4 gal. of Gas, pour it into a sewer and light the
     things out... The sewer will catch on fire and everything in it
     (Shit,Dead rats,dead skunks,dead skin heads, dead krishna...)
     will catch on fire too... Emitting a large amount of smoke, which
     will be grey, and will stink like a living-dead congress in
     Brazil.

 3.  Kar Krash...

     For that one, you will need a few screw drivers, 6" nails, a
     hammer and lotsa guts. Go out at night spot your favorite
     neighbors car.  nail is tire valves, so when he removes the
     nails, the tires will flat out. Then, take a flat screwdriver,
     and push it through the car locks. Take a Phillip's one, and make
     the hole bigger, being sure that the lock will be useless... On
     certain car, you can even unscrew the back windows (Honda,
     Hyundai) and then, you can slash the entire car interior.

11.72	A Guide to Hypnotism
	
Plagiarised by: the Jolly Roger


What Hypnotism Is.

	Hypnotism, contrary to common belief, is merely state when your
mind and body are in a state of relaxation and your mind is open to
positive, or cleverly worded negative, influences.  it is not a trance
where you:

	Are totally influencable.
	Cannot lie.
	A sleep which you cannot wake up from without help.
                    
                    
This may bring down your hope somewhat, but, hypnotism is a powerful for
self help, and/or mischief.

Your subconcious mind

	Before going in further, i'd like to state that hypnotism not only
is great in the way that it relaxes you and gets you (in the long run) what
you want, but also that it taps a force of incredible power, believe it or
not, this power is your subconcious mind.

	The subconcious mind always knows what is going on with every part
of your body, every moment of the day. It protects you from negative
influences, and retains the power to slow your heartbeat down and stuff
like that. The subconcious mind holds just about all the info you would
like to know about yourself, or, in this case, the person you will be
hypnotising. There are many ways to talk to your subconcious and have it
talk back to you. One way is the ouja board, no its not a spirit, merely
the minds of those who are using it. Another, which i will discuss here,
is the pendulum method. Ok, here is how it goes.


	First, get a ring or a washer and tie it to a thread a little longer
than half of your forearm. now, take a sheet of paper and draw a big circle
in it. In the big circle you must now draw a crosshair (a big +).  Now, put
the sheet of paper on a table. Next, hold the thread with the ring or
washer on it and place it (holding the thread so that the ring is 1 inch
above the paper swinging) in the middle of the crosshair.  Now, swing the
thread so the washer goes up and down, say to yourself the word "yes".
now, do it side to side and say the word "no". Do it counter clockwise and
say "I don't know".  and lastly, do it clockwise and say "I dont want to
say." now, with the thread back in the middle of the crosshair, ask
yourself questions and wait for the pendulum to swing in the direction for
the answer. (Yes, No, I dont know or I don't wanna say...). Soon, to your
amazement, it will be answering questions like anything... Let the pendulum
answer, dont try..  when you try you will never get an answer.  Let the
answer come to you.

How to induce hypnotism.

	Now that you know how to talk to your subconcious mind, i will now
tell you how to guide someone into hypnosis. note that I said guide, you
can never, hynotise someone, they must be willing. Ok, the subject must be
lying or sitting in a comfortable position, relaxed, and at a time when
things arent going to be interrupted.

	Tell them the following or something close to it, in a peaceful,
monotonous tone (not a commanding tone of voice).

Note:  light a candle and place it somewhere where it can be easily seen.

	Take a deep breath through your nose and hold it in for a count of
8. Now, through your mouth, exhale completely and slowly. Continued
breathing long, deep, breaths through your nose and exhaling through your
mouth. Tense up all your muscles very tight, now, counting from ten to
one, release them slowly, you will find them very relaxed. Now, look at
the candle, as you look at it, with every breath and passing momement, you
are feeling increasingly more and more peaceful and relaxed. The candles
flame is peaceful and bright.

	As you look at it I will count from 100 down, as a count, your eyes
will become more and more relaxed, getting more and more tired with each
passing moment."

	Now, count down from 100, about every 10 numbers say "when I reach
xx your eyes (or you will find your eyes) are becoming more and more
tired."  Tell them they may close their eyes whenever they feel like it.
If the persons eyes are still open when you get to 50 then instead of
saying "your eyes will.."  say "your eyes are...".

	When their eyes are shut say the following. as you lie (or sit)
here with your eyes comfortably close you find yourself relaxing more and
more with each moment and breath.

	The relaxation feels pleasant and blissful so, you happily give way
to this wonderful feeling. Imaginge yourself on a cloud, resting
peacefully, with a slight breeze caressing your body. A tingling sensasion
begins to work its way, within and without your toes, it slowly moves up
your feet, making them warm, heavy and relaxed. The cloud is soft and
supports your body with its soft texture, the scene is peaceful and
absorbing, the peacefulness absorbs you completely... 
	
	The tingling gently and slowly moves up your legs, relaxing them. 
making them warm and heavy. The relaxation feels very good, it feels so
good to relax and let go. As the tingling continues its journey up into
your solar plexus, you feel your inner stomach become very relaxed. Now,
it moves slowly into your chest, making your breathing relaxed as well.
the feeling begins to move up your arms to your shoulders, making your arms
heavy and relaxed as well. You are aware of the total relaxation you are
now experiencing, and you give way to it. It is good and peaceful, the
tingling now moveves into your face and head, relaxing your jaws, neck, and
facial muscles, making your cares and worries float away. away into the
blue sky as you rest blisfully on the cloud....
	
	If they are not responsive or you think they (he or she..) is going
to sleep, then add in a "...always concentrating upon my voice, ingoring
all other sounds.  Even though other sounds exist, they aid you in your
relaxation..." they should soon let out a sigh as if they were letting go,
and their face should have a "woodeness" to it, becoming featureless.

	Now, say the following ".... you now find yourself in a hallway,
the hallway is peaceful and nice. As i count from 10 to 1 you will imagine
yourself walking further and further down the hall. When i reach one you
will find yourself where you want to be, in another, higher state of
concious and mind. (count from ten to one).....". Do this about three or
four times. then, to test if the subject is under hypnosis or not, say
"...you feel a strange sensation in your (arm they write with) arm, the
feeling begins at your fingers and slowly moves up your arm, as it moves
through your arm your arm becomes lighter and lighter, it will soon be so
light it will ..... becoming lighter and lighter which each breath and
moment...". Their fingers should begin to twitch and then move up, the arm
following, now my friend, you have him/her in hypnosis. The first time you
do this, while he/she is under say good things, like: "your going to feel
great tomorrow" or "every day in every way you will find yourself becoming
better and better".. or some crap like that... the more they go under, the
deeper
	
In hypnosis they will get each time you do it.


What to do when hypnotised.
	
	When you have them under you must word things very carefully to get
your way. you cannot simply say... take off your clothes and fuck the
pillow. No, that would not really do the trick. you must say something
like.... "you find your self at home, in your room and you have to take a
shower (vividly describe their room and whats happening), you begin to take
off your clothes...". Now, it cant be that simple, you must know the
persons house, room, and shower room. Then describe things vividly and tell
them to act it out (they have to be deeply under to do this...). i would
just suggest that you experiment a while, and get to know how to do things.


Waking up.

	Waking up is very easy, just say "...as I count from 1 to 5 you
will find yourself becoming more and more awake, more and more lively.
When you wake up you will find yourself completely alive, awake, and
refreshed. Mentally and physically, remembering the pleasant sensation
that hypnosis brings... Waking up feeling like a new born baby, reborn
with life and vigor, feeling excellent. Remembering that next time you
enter hypnosis it will become an ever increasing deeper and deeper state
than before.

1)	You feel energy course throughout your limbs.
2)	You begin to breathe deeply, stirring.
3)	Beginning to move more and more your eyes open, bringing you up to
	full concious.
4)	You are up,up, up and awakening more and more.
5)	You are awake and feeling great."

	And thats it! You now know how to hypnotise yourself and someone
else. You will learn more and more as you experiment.


11.73     Operation: Fuckup
     
Courtesy of: the Jolly Roger

	This is a guide for Anarchists and can be funny for non-believers
and 12 and 13 year old runts, and can be a lexicon of deadly knowledge for
True Anarchists. Serious damage is intended to be dealt here. Do not try
this stuff unless you want to do a lot of serious Anarchy. [Simulation]
Asshole - 'Listen, you little teenager punk shit, shut the fuck up, or I'll
knock you down!' Anarchist - 'O.K..  You can't say I didn't warn you. You
don't know my true power...' (soooo casually) Asshole - 'Well, er, what do
you mean? Anarchist - '<demoniac grin>' As you can see, the Anarchist knows
something that this asshole doesn't.

[Operation Fuckup]

	Get a wheel barrel or two. Fill with gasoline. Get 16 rolls of
toilet paper, unroll & drench in the gasoline. Rip to shreds in gasoline.
Get asbestos gloves. Light a flare (to be punk), grab a glob of saturated
toilet paper (you cane ignite the glob or not).  Throw either flaming or
dripping glob into: any window (picture is the best) front doors rough
grain siding and best of all, brick walls. First of all, this bitch is
near impossible to get off once dried, and is a terror to people inside
when lit! After this, during the night, get a pickup truck, a few
wheel-barrels, and a dozen friends with shovels. The pickup can be used
only for transporting people and equipment, or doing that, and carting all
the dirt. When it gets around 12:00 (after the loser goes beddie - bye),
dig a gargantuan hole in his front yard until about 3:00. You can either
assign three or four of your friends to cart the dirt ten miles away in the
pickup-bed, or bury his front door in 15' of dirt! After that is done, get
three or four buckets of tar, and coat his windows. You can make an added
twist by igniting the tar when you are all done and ready to run! That is
if the loser has a house. If he lives inside an apartment building, you
must direct the attack more toward his car, and front door. I usually
start out when he goes to work. I find out what his cheap car looks like,
and memorize it for future abuse. It is always fun to paint his front door
(apt.) hot pink with purple polka-dots, and off-neon colors in diagonal
stripes. You can also pound a few hundred or so four inch nails into his
front door (this looks like somebody really doesn't like you from the
inside).

	Another great is to fill his keyhole with liquid steel so that
after the bastard closes his door - the only way to get back in is to break
it down. If you can spare it, leave him an axe - that is, implanted three
inches into, and through the door! Now, this next one is difficult, but
one of the best! Get a piece of wood siding that will more than cover his
front door completely. Nail two by fours on the edges of the siding (all
except the bottom) so you have a barge-like contraption. Make a hole at
the top that will be large enough for a cement slide. Mix about six or
seven LARGE bags of QUICK drying cement. Use the cement slide to fill the
antichamber created by the 'barge' that is around his door. Use more two by
fours to brace your little cement-filled barge, and let the little gem dry.
When it is, remove the 'barge' so only a stone monolith remains that covers
his door.  Use any remaining cement to make a base around this so he can't
just push it over. When I did this, he called the fire department, and they
thought he meant wood, so they brought axes. I watched with a few dozen or
so other tenants, and laughed my damn ass off!

 	This is only his door! After he parks his car for the night, the
fun really begins. I start out by opening up the car by jamming a very
thin, but long screwdriver in the keyhole and pulling the lock out! Then
proceed to put orange-juice syrup all over the seats, so after he gets
through all the other shit that you do, he will have the stickiest seats in
the world. You can then get a few Sunday papers, and crack one of the
windows about four inches. Lightly crumple the papers, and continue to
completely fill the inside of his car with the newspapers. A copy of the
Sunday New York Times will nicely fill a Volkswagon! What is also quite
amusing is to put his car on cinder blocks, slash his tires at the top, and
fill them with cement! Leave the cinder blocks there so that, after he
knocks the car off of them, he will get about 3 miles to the gallon with
those tires, and do 0 to 60 in about two minutes! It is even more hilarious
when he doesn't know why the hell why! Another is to open his hood, and
then run a few wires from the sparkplugs to the METAL body. The sure is
one HOT car when it is running! Now, I like to pour two pounds of sugar
down his gas tank. If this doesn't blow every gasket in his engine it will
do something called 'carmelizing his engine'. This is when the extreme heat
turns the sugar to carmel, and you literally must completely take the
engine out and apart, and clean each and every individual part!  Well, if
this asshole does not get the message, you had better start to get serious.
If this guide was used properly & as it was intended (no, not as kindling
for the fire), this asshole will either move far away, seek professional
psychological help, commit suicide, or (d) all of the above! 


12.0     FRAUD

12.1    Change Machine Fraud

Author: The Prisoner

	Okay, there are certain ways to take money out of a change machine.

	1) You can blow the fucker up.

	2) You can use this quick and easy method.


	Heres what ya do....

	I.
		There  are certain types of money changing machines...The one
YOU need is the kind where ya put yer bill in the tray <lengthwise> ,push the
tray in to get yer change...

	II.
		Once  you got the right machine,get a $5 or a $1 ,it helps if
the  bill  is WRINKLED...Then tear a notch in the bill on the lower left side
of the bill.Cut the notch about 3.5 cm.  from the lower left hand corner...

	III.
		Now, go to the machine..put the bill in the tray and slide it
in...   Now  what  will  happen is the machine will have so far read the bill
right  and  it  will  spit out yer change..  Then when it reads the notch, it
will  think  the  bill  is fucked up and reject it and like you will have the
change and yer bill...

	For  this  to  werk right you must have done this right..it does take
practice  but  once  you  can  do  this  your local Money Changer will be yer
bank...


12.2     How to Counterfeit

Author: The Wave 

	This  article  deals  with  how  to  make  counterfeit money.  Before
reading  this  article  it  would  be  a  very  good idea to get a book about
photo-offset  printing,  for that's how you'll have to print it.  For someone
who is familiar with offset printing, printing money is a breeze.  Real money
is  made  by  a  process  called gravure.  It involves carving out of a metal
block (but I don't think anyone can do that by hand-if you can, you should be
on  That's Incredible!).  When you are done (if you did everything correctly)
you will have a finished product nearly identical to real money, depending on
your printing skills. Well, let's get started!


	First  I'd  like  to  tell you briefly how offset printing works.  It
starts  by  making  negatives (kind of like when you take a picture with your
camera).   Then  you  take  the  negatives and put them on a piece of masking
material  ( usually orange).  Then you expose the STRIPPED negatives or FLATS
to a lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker.  The BURNED plates are
then  developed  with  the proper developer chemical.  These plates (one at a
time  of  course)  are  wrapped  around the plate cylinder of the press.  The
press  to  use  should  be an 11 by 14 (or so) offset such as the 11 by 17 AB
Dick  360.   Then  the printing begins!  To learn in detail how to do each of
these  steps you should again get a book on the subject.  The presswork takes
some practice, but you'll get the hang of it.

	Ok, quit babbling on, Wave, and start the good stuff!  By the way you
can  pick up an 11 by 14 offset for about $500 if you shop around (or you can
**  BORROW  **  a  press  from  your  local Insty Prints at about 3:00 in the
morning!).   First, like I said before, you need negatives.  Make 2 negatives
of  the  portrait  side of the bill and 1 of the back side.  After developing
them  and letting them dry, take them to a light table.  Get some opaque and,
on  one  of  the  portrait  sides,  touch out all the green (the seal and the
serial  numbers).  Line that one up on the FLAT and leave about 1/2 inch from
the  top  of the flat.  Then for the other portrait, touch out everything BUT
the  seal  and  serial numbers.  The back side doesn't require any retouching
because  it  is all one color.  Now, make sure all the negatives are lined up
right,  or REGISTERED, on the flats.  By the way, every time you need another
serial number, just shoot 1 neg.  of the portrait side and cut out the serial
number.   Cut out the old serial number from the flat and replace it with the
new one.

	Ok, now you have 3 flats, each represents a different color-black and
2  shades  of  green  (which of course are made by mixing inks).  Now you are
ready  to burn the plates.  Take a lithographic plate and mark 3 marks on it.
These  marks must be 2 & 9/16 in.  apart, starting on one of the short edges.
Do the same thing to 2 more plates.  Then take 1 of the flats and place it on
the plate, lining the short edge up with the edge of the plate-EXACTLY!  Burn
it,  move  it  up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you already
burned.   Burn that and do the same thing 2 more times-moving the flat up one
mark.   Then  do  the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a separate
plate).   Develope all 3 plates.  You should have 4 images on each plate with
an equal space between each bill.


			     Roll the Presses!


	The  paper  you  will  need  won't match exactly, but you can make it
pretty  damn  close  (close enough for the cashier at K-Mart!).  The paper to
use should have a 25% rag content.  I have found that Disaperf computer paper
works  great - that's the kind that you can barely see the perforation.  Take
this paper (cut the pinfeed holes off first!) and load it into the press.  Be
sure to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right.  Start with the black
plate (the one with out the serial numbers).  Wrap it around the cylinder and
load  black  ink in.  Make sure you run more than you need because there will
be  a  lot  of  rejects.   Then,  while that's printing, mix the inks for the
serial #'s and the back side.  You'll need to add some white and maybe yellow
to  the  serial  # ink.  You need to add black to back side.  Experiment till
you  get  it  right.  Clean the press and print the other side.  Now you have
the  bill wioth no green seal or serial numbers.  Print a few with one serial
number,  make  another  and  repeat.   Keep doing this until you have as many
different  numbers  as you want.  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a
paper  cutter Now you have a lot of money, except there is still one problemo
-  the  paper  is pure white.  To dye it, mix the following in a pan:  2 cups
hot water, 4

	Tea  bags, and about 16-20 drops of green food coloring (experiment).
Dip  one  of  the bills in and compare it to a brand new REAL bill.  Make the
necessary adjustments, and dye all the bills.  Then it is a good idea to make
them   look   used.    Wrinkle   them,   rub  coffee  grinds  on  them,  etc.
Congratulations!  You're rich!

	Some  of  the info was taken from The Poor Man's James Bond, but most
from  personal  knowledge.  Also, it would be a good idea to see the movie To
Live  and Die in L.A.  It is about a counterfeiter and they did a good job of
showing how to do it.  Well, that's all folks!


12.3    How To Rip Off Pay Phones
        
Introduction.

	Phone ripping is a great way to earn money and it is very flexible
you can choose your own hours, work part time, full time or casual. And it
is one of the few thefts that you can actuly do in public and not have to
worry about people looking or not.(coin ripping only!) So where did it
originate?  well i believe i was one of the first in Melbourne to think of
such a great money making venture. But i latter discovered that americans
had been doing this since the 60's.

Vocabulary.

          Motherload   :-   More than $25 from one phone.

          Motherloader :-   A phone that always produces $25 plus.

          Slow Flow    :-   Placing too many tisues in a box can
                            cause money to come out a little at a time.

          Jam or Jama  :-   When it is so full that money RAINS down
                            causing the door to close and jam shut !



Slot Ripping.

	In order to know how to rip you must first know the coin return and its
hazards. Here is a basic diagram of a coin slot shown on a view of the right
side of box.

                |__>_____________________/



     Sorry about the basic drawing but i am sure you will get the idea.

Now before going to a box lets get organised you will need the following:-

                           1 melways
                           1 box of tisues
                           1 piece of THIN wire (1.5 mm thick or less)
                           30 one cent coins
                           1 tac (or nail)
                           10 bandades


How Much Can be Made.

          Ok guys, its time to do some mapping, open up your melways and
find all the telephone boxes you can walk to (ride, drive to etc) and make
a mental list it takes 10 phone boxes emptied 5 times a week to earn aprox
$300 a week (give or take a little depending on where you live. i used to
do work at hungy jacks in the city, and was earning about 185 bucks an week
at jacks and about 500 bucks a week doing 8 boxes,4 times a week (so the
money is good!)


Doing The Job

	Approch the box as if you are going to make a call. This is not
just so you dont look suspicous but it is an idea to test the phone by
making a free call to the operator (in most phones the money will come back
out) thus you know the phone is working, to save you the trouble of
PAPERING a phone that does not work. If the phone works yet does not exept
money then you are in luck you have found a phone that can make up to $82
in one day (max holding!!!) this phone is named a SLOT MACHINE ! but be
carefull because they can easily turn into a MOTHERLOAD JAMA. ok so if all
is ok you can then start inserting tisues into the coin slot. Place a few
at a time and then push them up the slot (BUT NOT TOO FAR!!) test that
there are no leaks by inserting four one cent coins down the slot. This is
also good cause you can see if anyone has taken money from your phone and
reset the tisues your 4 cents will be missing.


	OK now is the really hard part. When you think it is just
about time to collect your hard earned cash  use a bandade or 2 and tape
the tiny nail to your finger (This is helpful but if you have long fingers
you can do it without) push you finger up the slot making sure it is
against the left was if the coin slot (so you miss the small but sometimes
NASTY little spike) Now scoop the paper down and there is your cash!!!


Notes:

          Some phones use a door like this    =============
          so that fingers can not put pushed    \         |
          up into the slot (thats where the      \        |
          thin wire comes in) bend the wire       \  |    |
          and place the paper up with it and       \==    |
          remove it the same way.                 ----------


	If you find a phone that is hard or imposable to do than just super
glue the top so they have to use the phone that you HAVE papered!

          Never use telephone book paper!

                    
12.4     Making Vending Machine Keys
     
From: The Anarchy Disk
Author: The Paper Tiger & The Pyro
Typed by: Pirates of Puget Sound
Reprinted from: TAP magazine, December 1983, Issue 89

	This worked for a friend of mine at school (I would) never do anything
like this) it got him over $900 in one day. Here's how to do it:

	On almost all vending machines they have those damn round almost
unpickable locks on them so:

	When no one is looking quickly press a piece of AIR-HARDENING clay
into the lock. (Press hard enough to get a good impression.)

	Remove the clay carefully and let it dry for however long the clay
has to dry as specified on the package.

	You now have a key to fit that lock, (this Type of 'key' can be
easily crushed If you're seen. But if you're smart you won't though)

Have Phun!!

Appendix B:     CHECKLIST FOR RAIDS ON LABS

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

     LIQUIDS                    SOLIDS
     _______                    ______

     ____     Nitric Acid        ____     Potassium Perchlorate
     ____     Sulfuric Acid      ____     Potassium Chlorate
     ____     95% Ethanol        ____     Picric Acid (usually a powder)
     ____     Toluene            ____     Ammonium Nitrate
     ____     Perchloric Acid    ____     Powdered Magnesium
     ____     Hydrochloric Acid  ____     Powdered Aluminum

                         ____    Potassium Permanganate

Appendix C:    USEFUL PYROCHEMISTRY

     In general, it is possible to make many chemicals from just a few basic
ones.  A list of useful chemical reactions is presented.  It assumes knowledge
of general chemistry; any individual who does not understand the following
reactions would merely have to read the first five chapters of a high school
chemistry book.

1.  potassium perchlorate from perchloric acid and potassium hydroxide
     K(OH)       +     HClO     ---->     KClO     +    H O
                   4              4           2

2.  potassium nitrate from nitric acid and potassium hydroxide
      "       +     HNO     ---->     KNO     +     "
                  3             3

3.  ammonium perchlorate from perchloric acid and ammonium hydroxide
     NH OH       +     HClO     ---->     NH ClO     +     "

4.  ammonium nitrate from nitric acid and ammonium hydroxide
        NH OH       +     HNO     ---->     NH NO     +     "

5.  powdered aluminum from acids, aluminum foil, and magnesium

A.     aluminum foil    +    6HCl    ---->   2AlCl   +   3H
                                                3            2

B.     2AlCl  (aq)   +    3Mg    ---->  3MgCl (aq)   +  2Al
          3                                  2

     The Al will be a very fine silvery powder at the bottom of the container
which must be filtered and dried.   This same method works with nitric and
sulfuric acids, but these acids are too valuable in the production of high
explosives to use for such a purpose, unless they are available in great excess.
