			       NUCLEAR TRANSIT

*****************************************************************************

  Nuclear material doesn't magically appear at plants that make missiles and
bombs.	It has to be transported by truck or train.  The media has seen fit to
portray a totally false picture of the security surrounding the operation.
Getting enriched Uranium or Plutonium is seen as marginally difficult, just
force a lone semi off the road and loot it.  I hope to give the true picture of
the task and of the equipment.

This report has been compiled with the help (knowing and unknowing) of the US
Department of Energy, the APCO Journal, and a source in FEMA.

				 The Locations
				 -------------
Oak Ridge,TN.  Union Carbide runs a Uranium enrichment plant here.  It has a
	       sister complex in Paducah Ky that makes Uranium Hexafluoride,
	       a deadly gas that is sometimes transported on the Interstates.

Amarillo,TX.   The most dangerous city on earth. A little known factory, the
	       Pantex Company, takes the enriched fissionable materials and
	       assembles them into warheads.  The equipment is vintage 1950.
	       Accidents are unheard of.  They may happen, but the press
	       sure never gets word of them.

Albuquerque,
NM.	       Sandia National Labs, under contract to the Depatment of Ener-
	       gy, performs research on weapons and radioactive materials.
	       Kirkland AFB, communications command center for the DOE is
	       also located here.
San Francisco,
CA.	       Lawrence Livermore Lab also performs research on the more
	       classified aspects of nuclear chemistry.

Chicago, IL.   Argonne Labs research "peaceful" applications of highly
	       radioactive metals and gases.  Sure thing...

Joplin, MO.    The largest contractor of freight-hauling for DOE is based
	       in the Southwestern tip of MO.  I'd like to take a tour of
	       Tri-State Motor Transit (TSMT) sometime.  I'd also like an
	       unescorted day in the Pentagon.	I have as much chance at
	       getting either one.

			     The Transit Process.
			     --------------------
  a surprise in store.	The actual drivers are heavily armed, excellently
trained DOE Special Couriers.  Th ride 2 to a spelly equipped sem 2 ormi's and 4
to 5 support vehicles to a convoy.  The support staff also consists of Couriers
in a variety of vehicles.  Most of the time they include a Motorhome, a Suburban
(armored) and possibly a station wagon or two.	If a cop tries to pull over a
semi, the entire convoy pulls over.  A courier in the offending vehicle uses the
PA to announce the nature of the convoy, and will exit the truck if requested.
The driver NEVER exits.

			     Spotting a Convoy
			     -----------------
  The actual semi's are usually unmarked (DOE-owned), or are turquoise with
regular silver trailers that may bear the logo TSMT.  In NO case will they bear
a yellow & black "Radioactive" Placard.  DOE vehicles bear a single license tag,
blue on white, that starts with an "E".  The semi's have what appears to be a
luggage rack on the top.  This is an antenna.  They may stop at Weigh stations,
but will be waved on through.

				The Weapons
				-----------
  Couriers are trained in use of the standard issue M-16, the M-60, and the LAW
rocket.  They carry at least that amount of weapons with them, and possibly the
new Viper Antitank weapon.  Other items include gas (BZ, CS) and maybe a few
goodies from the Farm...  Their training in Colorado Springs, CO.  takes about 3
months and covers everything from evasive driving with a 130,000 pound armored
tractor-trailer to recovery of fissionable material from adversaries to
emergency field evacuation and containment.  Their trucks are probably the best
weapons.  DOE-owned vehicles, used for the most az ardous materials (transit of
old warheads for reconditioning) are totally covered by a classified thickness
of nickel or aluminium armor (That's right, Aluminium in an alloy form with
other metals).	The trailers are rigged with nozzles that will envelop a
terrorist who manages to open the doors with a mountain of fast-hardening urea
(insulating) foam, suffocating him and hiding the warhead/Plutonium with a thick
coat of the stuff.

			       Forget it.
			       ----------
  The condition of each truck on the road is updated by couriers every 15
minutes by Shortwave to the Command Post in NM.  The transmissions are in
encrypted digital bursts on 11.555, 7.700 and 3.335 MHz, USB.  Rarely you
can hear the base speak with a Courier.  Intra-convoy communications are
handled with low-power VHF radios on 164.375 and 164.225 MHz.  They were
duped by those shitheads at Motorola into buying Digital Voice protection,
a scrambling system.  Granted, you can't understand what they're saying
(probably stuff like "Wanna eat at Denny's or go to the Truck Stop?").
Basic SIGINT still tells you that prescence of ANY transmissions means a
convoy is close.  Listen for what sounds like a squelch burst and a tone
at the end, that's the DVP.

  If a trouble signal is transmitted to the CP, a number of things happen.
First, the dispatcher attempts to reach the convoy by SW to find the nature of
the problem; accident, out of beer, or terrorist attack.  The first re- sponse
will bring out an EOD team from the nearest Army base and added Albuquerque.
They contact the respective State Police agency for local coordination.  In case
of k, I can't really say what will hn be- cause I don't know.  Speculating, Ieve
the Army rponse will be much greater.  Instead of MP's, combat troops will be
airlifted along with the Decon.  and Emergency Ordnance Disposal troops.  State
police will also flood the area and seal if off, with local units merely
handling roadblocks at the perimeters.	Any non-authorized (non-government)
aircraft passing near the area will be either escorted out by the TAC, or be
downed.  This includes news media choppers.  NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search
Team) will be called at once to aid in locating possibly contaminated areas and
assist in finding any missing fissionable material.  If an intact warhead is
found to be missing, a national state of emergency will be declared until the
situation is re- solved.  This means a callup of National Guard and the
Reserves, as well as placing all active military personnel on full alert.  It
also means that various civil rights will be curtailed and curfews set.  This is
some serious shit.  The National Emergency Command Alert Post (NECAP, a.k.a.
The Flying White House) will become active, as well ALL U.S.  Military Personnel
throughout the world (This would, after all, be a good time for the Soviets to
pull some tricks since we'd be rather busy at home).

  The terrorists wouldn't have a chance in hell.  Detonating a bomb would
probably wipe out the entire bunch of assholes and they wouldn't have gained
anything.  A good negotiator would stretch the ordeal out so that our marksmen
would get in a shot.  Or more likely, they would evacuate the area (There'd be
way to simply drive off with the bomb as the Couriers' first job should be to
eliminate all means of escape from the area).  Per- sonally, I'd use poison gas
or BZ.	It's nonthreatening, safer than shooting and silent as well as highly
effective and not a big dramatic finish to inspire another bunch of shitheads to
be crucified for "the cause" in front of America.  I doubt if the group would
ever be identi- fied or their true demands known.  A large number of both real
terrorists (e.g.  FALN, M-19, Animal rights and splinter anti-abortion factions)
and Intelligence (CIA and DOE) created groups would claim responsibility so the
organizations would see how unproductive pulling such a stunt would be in the
future - no exclusive media attention means no gain.

  Note to any Federal agency who gets hold of this.  I want to work for DOE
intelligence.  All of this is put together from unclassified sources.  If it's
good enough to get me in trouble, wouldn't you agree I'd be good to have working
for your organization??  Think of this as a Resume.
