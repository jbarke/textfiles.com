LETTER BOMBS ARE VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE,
BUT THE DIFFICULT PART IS MAKING SURE
IT WILL DETONATE PROPERLY, OR THAT IT
IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A BOMB.

MIXTURES:
ABOUT 75% ALUMINUM POWDER WITH 25%
IRON POWER IS BEST.  THIS IS A LIGHT
VERSION OF THERMITE, SINCE IT IS IN
AN ENCLOSED SPACE (THE ENVELOPE, AS
DESCRIBED BELOW A WAYS).
MIX THE ABOVE WELL.  THE IDEA IS
THIS:  IRON CAN BURN, AT A VERY HIGH
TEMPERATURE, BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE
HELP.  THIS IS WHAT THE ALUMINUM IS
FOR.  ALUMINUM BURNS AT A RELATIVELY
LOW TEMPERATURE, SO IT IS USED AS A
CATALYST OF SORTS.  MAGNESIUM IS USED
TO FLASH-IGNITE THE ALUMINUM, WHICH
THEN BURNS THE IRON, AT A SUITABLE
TEMPERATURE.  SINCE THIS IS GOING OFF
IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE, IT WILL BURN
MUCH HOTTER AND SLOWER AND WITH MORE
VIOLENCE THAN A NORMAL MIX.
I ADVISE YOU PLAY WITH THIS FOR A
WHILE, LEARNING YOUR MIXTURE.

NOW FOR THE FUN STUFF:
GET AN INSULATED (PADDED) ENVELOPE,
THE TYPE THAT IS DOUBLE LAYERED.
SEPERATE THE LAYERS.  IN THE INNER
LAYER GOES THE WONDERFUL MIXTURE,
ONE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH.  KEEP
THIS SECTION SEPERATE, BUT IT MIGHT
BE HANDLE TO TOP IT OFF WITH SOME
MAGNESIUM.  THE OUTER LAYER CAN BE
EITHER MAGNESIUM, FOR A FLASH BOMB,
OR POSSIBLY A MATERIAL OF YOUR OWN
CHOICE.
NOW FOR THE DIFFICULT PART!
THE FUSE...   WE CAN MAKE A FUSE
FROM ANOTHER SET OF CHEMICALS:
IODINE CRYSTALS, AND AMONIUM HYDROXIDE,
IN LIQUID FORM.  MIX THESE TOGETHER,
IN ABOUT AND EQUAL AMOUNT, BUT YOU
MIGHT WANT TO USE A HEAVY AMOUNT OF
IODINE IF PRESSED FOR TIME.  THESE
FORM A NEW CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE, ABOUT
AND INCH LONG.  THESE ARE HIGHLY
VOLATILE, AND I ADVISE KEEPING THEM
PROTECTED.  THEY HAVE ABOUT THE IMPACT
POWER OF AN M-100 FOR A TEASPOON.
I PUT THESE IN A PROTECTIVE CARD-BOARD
LINING, AND PUT THEM AT THE TOP OF
THE ENVELOPE.  RIG THIS SO IT PUTS
PRESSURE ON THE CRYTALS WHEN THE
PACKAGE IS OPENED, BUT NOT FROM JUST
SQUEEZING THE ENVELOPE.  THIS IS
TRICKY, AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT HERE.
SEAL THIS UP, AND YOU HAVE A WORKING
LETTER BOMB.
BY THE WAY, SINCE THE BULK OF LETTER
BOMBS ARE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE, THEY
RARELY MAKE IT PAST THE POST OFFICE.

*****
I FROWN UPON THE USE OF LETTER BOMBS
AS A MEANS OF GETTING EVEN BECAUSE
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IT IS GOING TO
DETONATE AROUND, OR THAT IT WILL
EVEN BE THEM.  THERE ARE SIMPLER WAYS
OF GETTING EVEN, SO TAKE ONE OF THEM.
IT IS ALSO A FEDERAL OFFENCE TO MAKE
AND SEND ONE.  PROCEDE AT YOUR OWN
RISK.
*****
HOW TO AVOID LETTER BOMBS:
SINCE YOU MADE IT THIS FAR INTO THE
FILE, I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO AVOID
BEING DETONATED WITH A LETTER BOMB
YOU MAY HAVE HAD SENT TO YOU.
1)  NEVER OPEN A LETTER BOMB THE WAY
    IT WANTS TO BE OPENED!  THIS IS
    THE WAY OF POSSIBLY AVOIDING THE
    FUSE.  IF IT IS SET TO DETONATE
    ON CONTACT WITH AIR, THEN THIS
    WILL NOT WORK.
2)  DON'T sQUEEZE, BEND, OR ANYTHING!
3)  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BOMB, THEN
    DON'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  THIS IS
    THE BEST WAY TO AVOID PROBLEMS!
