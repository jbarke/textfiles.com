Creating the mixture:

Here is a cheap and easy way to make yourself a very effective napalm
substitute.  You'll need gasoline, styrofoam, and a pail.  I use a metal
pail, but anything that can hold up to gasoline is good.  Start with
enough gasoline to cover the bottom of the pail about a half inch deep.
Then start adding the styrofoam.  The gasoline will sort of soak it up.
Just keep adding more and more styrofoam, putting it in slowly, waiting for
it to be absorbed by the gasoline, until it wont soak up any more.  It will
take quite a bit of styrofoam, so make sure you have alot on hand.  When
the gasoline stops soaking up the styrofoam it's done.  Pour off the
mixture into a glass jar for storage. Avoid getting the mixture on your
skin because it will cause serious irritation.  Wash your hands when you're
through to avoid getting it into your eyes, etc.  Voila!  You have some
napalm.



Practical application:

The mixture can be used as a throwing weapon.  To make a neat little
projectile take a glass bottle and score the outside with a glass cutter in
a checkerboard pattern.  Pour the mixture into the bottle.  Put a gasoline
soaked rag into the neck of the bottle.  Light the rag and throw the bottle.
The reason for the scoring is to make the bottle break easily on impact,
so that when it is thrown the mixture spreads into a wide radius and gets
ignited by the burning rag.  This stuff does a nasty job on car paint...
just pour it onto your victim's car and light.  For a neat timed ignition
system, see below.  If you used the right amount of styrofoam this stuff
will burn for a looooong time leaving much expensive damage in it's wake.



Neat timed ignition system:

To make this you'll need a cigarette, matches, and some masking tape.  Take
about a 2 inch length of tape and lay it down flat.  Line up matches side by
side perpendicular to the length of the tape, covering about half <fig.1>.


             ooooooooooooo

                     ------

Wrap the tape/matches around the cigarette so the match heads are about an
eighth of an inch up from the filter.  You can spread the mixture on whatever
it is you are going to be burning and lay the igniter so that the cigarette
is away from the mixture and the matches are just at the edge.  Light the
cigarette first!  It will take some time for the head of the cigarette to
reach the matches, thus igniting them, thus igniting the mixture.  It takes
some practice to get the placement right, but when you have it down it gives
you time to get away.  I actually got this idea from the news.  It was used
by an accomplished arsonist in setting gasoline fires.  Isn't the media
wonderful?

That's all for now.  Above all, have fun!
