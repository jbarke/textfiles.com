                           How to make Thermite
                          Written by Dark Angel
                            of The Lost Realm
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
  
  
    Intro(ahh come'on it's only a few lines):Okay,I made this file for
  people to learn how to make thermite,thermite is a substance which
  can burn through practilly anything,it is useful in the task of 
  breaking into payfones,opening those doors with the nasty master
  locks on them,and burning a whole in basically anything you want.
  Okay,on with the file.
  
  
  
  Okay,now for the list of ingredients:
  
  1. Rust
  2. Aluminum filings
  3. Magneseum ribbon
  
  
  First of all,you have to get rust...Now if you've never made
  thermite before,you are probably wondering,"Where the hell can I get
  rust?"or maybe you're not wondering that. Welp,there are two ways 
  that I know of to get rust:
  
  1. Waste a lot of time and scrape it off of a rusty object
     (Not very good)
  2. Make it from a piece of iron(works best) to do this you have to:
  
  1. Find an iron nail,find some wire(alligator clips come in handy)
     find a glass jar(quart size jar is what I use),find water,
     and find some salt.Find an AC(NOT DC!!!)power device.This is a
     real difficult task to find all of these items,you may have to
     hire someone to find them for you.
  
  2. Fill the glass jar with water,add some salt,take the wire and
     hook it up to your AC power supply(Trian transformer,battery
     charger,but don't hook it up to a power cord with one end of it
     cut off,it will heat the water so much it will boil and break the
     glass,and don't hook it up to your electric blanket power thingy
     this will defenily mess you up.Trust me I know from experience.)
     Then solder the gator clips to the ends of the wire.Then hook one
     clip to the nail and stick MOST of the nail in the water,if you
     put the gator into the water it will probably disintegrate.Then
     place the other clip into the water.

  3. Now,turn on you AC power supply,you should see little bubbles
     forming around the nail.If the bubble form around the other
     gator clip,just put the nail into that clip.Now all you can do
     is sit back and do something else until the next morning.

  4. The next morning when you go and get the nail,it shouldn't be
     there,instead you should see a lot of red crud in the glass.
     Filter out the crud,or get it out with a spoon. Then dry it out.
     The fastest way to do this is put it in an iron skillet,heat
     this over a low flame until it turns a nice red color and all
     the water is out. Now you have rust!!!Wasn't that fun??


  Now for one of the easy parts,get some aluminum filings.You can get
  these from a hardware store or get an aluminum bar and file off
  as much as you need,but if you do this make sure it is more than
  94% pure.

  Now all you have to do is mix the rust and aluminum filings together
  and you have thermite. Now I could just end the file here and let
  you wonder,"How the hell am I supposed to light this shit?",well
  I'm going to tell you.Now you could try and use a match,but you 
  wouldn't have any lick that way,you could use a blowtorch,but you
  still wouldn't get any results,but if you take the match,the
  blowtorch,AND....Magneseum strips,THEN,you could light it..WOW!!!
  To do this,place the thermite where you want it to burn,then place
  the mag. strip and place it in the thermite like a fuse. Now,take
  the match and strike it on something,turn the gas on the blowtorch
  on, and hold the match up to the end of the blow torch now move the
  flame to the end of the strip and light it.After you light it don't
  stand around it and watch it,get away!!This stuff can vaporize steel
  and God only knows what it could do to your skin.

  The proper ratio for making thermite is 3 to 1(3 parts rust to 1
  part aluminum powder.

  Well,this is basically how to make thermite. But if you read down
  a little bit more I'll show you different ways to shape it.





  Okay,when I make thermite I always melt a little bit of wax and
  vasolene(Petroleum jelly) with it,this lets you cram it into key
  holes and stuff like that,when you do mix it,make sure that there
  is a lot more thermite than wax in the stuff you make.


  One of my friends suggested mixing it with melted plastic and
  forming it into a cube,or a key if you know how and stick it in
  the key hole and light it to burn out a door knob or something)
  I have no idea if this works.


  If you want to have some fun take ALOT of thermite and wax/petroleum
  jelly mixture and fill a pop can up with it and stick a sparkler
  in place of a magnesium strip or you can use a mag. strip in the
  can,but anyway,do all the above and light the sparkler,then throw
  the can at something and when the sparkler hits the thermite it will
  burn through the can and whatever's under the can,this is useful
  for destroying the inside of cars(Hee Hee Hee).

                               By Dark Angel

  Intro : (You just hate intros don't you,well I do to,but when you
          start writing thses things you start to understand why they
          are there.) Here it is......This file was presented to you
          by me to tell you how to make a beige box and to give my BBS
          some publicity.First of all,for those of you out there who
          don't know what a beige box is,it is simply a lineman's 
          handset.A lineman's handset is the thing you see phone
          workers talking into when they are up on poles and stuff
          like that.Now on with the file....



  The Beige Box....
      Okay,there are four ways that I know of to make a beige box.
      For all the ways that I know of you will need the following:

      1. A phone. (Should be old and not used much,touch tone
         is probally neccesary)
      2. Gator Clips(Needed badly,avalible at you local radio shack)
      3. A phone cord
      4. A modular jack(The thing on the wall.)
      5. An output device
      6. A bit of confidence

  The first way to make a beige box is:

      1. Take the modular jack and find the red and green wires,take
         these wires and soder the gater clips to them.

      2. Take your phone and phone cord and hook them up to the beige
         box.

      3. Take the red and green wires and find an output device,in my
         area they are little black poles with domes on the top of
         them,all you need to open them is an adjustible wrench.

      4. Open the output device,find the red and green terminals
         and hook the approiate wires to them(Red to red--Green to
         green) And that's about it. To find out what number you are
         on dial 999-999-9999 and you should here a recording of the
         operator saying the number.

  The second way that I know how to make a B. Box is:
      
      1. Take a phone cord and put the gator clips on the red and
         green  wires.

      2. Hook the wires to the proper terminal and viola!!


  The third way is:

      1. Get an old phone,take it apart get the red and green wires
         that go to the grey part where you hook up the phone cord
         and hook the gator clips to them.

      2. Hook the wires to the proper terminals and there you go.

  The forth way isn't very good and you can only listen to people.

      1. Get a phone hand piece and hook the gator clips to the cord
         coming out of it.
    
      2. Hook the wires up to the proper terminals. And you can listen
         if anyone is on the line.

 
  Uses of the beige box....

  Some ways to use the beige box is:

      1. Eavesdropping--This is a good way to blackmail someone.
      2. Calling long distance--You can call long distance and get
         crystal clear reception and make someone's phone bill
         skyrocket.
      3. Bugging people--Leave your phone off the hook(The one hooked
         to the output device)and the people will not be able to call
         out or recieve any calls.
      4. Bugging the operator--You can call and harass the operator
         at very little risk to yourself.
      5. Here's a nice one--Get a phone cord that's very long and hook
         it to the OD and hook it up to your computer and hack
         those numbers that have a trace on them(Hee hee hee)
      6. Use your imagination!!!You can do anything because you are 
         on somebody else's line!!!! Just besure to dial ANI to make
         sure you are not on your own line!!


  Tips for beige boxing:
      
      1. Don't use the same output device for very long unless you
         have to,or alternate devices.
      2. Don't make any noise and besure there are no barking dogs
         or cars driving by so people won't get suspicios that you
         are listening.
      3. Use an output device that is in a hidden spot,or your sure to
         get caught.
      4. Don't leave any evidence that you have been in the OD except
         maybe a piece of transparent tape over the edge so if any
         one opens the OD the tape will ripped off.
      5. Don't tell anyone what you have been doing--you can never
         trust another person,not even another phreak(They may be 
         jealous of your keen ability and snitch on you).
      6. Watch out for white vans and any kind of upper athority 
         vehicles like police cars etc..
      7. You should be able to use your head because most of this is
         just common sense and you should know what to do so you won't
         get caught..

                   How to have fun with electricity

  Intro(I know you hate intros but I just put them here to bug the
       hell out of you) : I wrote this file for you people out there
       who would like to give someone a little shock,or fry small
       animals,but please keep in mind as said in the disclaimer above
       this information is presented for informational purposes only/



    One way I've found to have fun with electric is by taking an old
  extension cord and cutting the end with the plug holes off and then
  stripping the ends and then wire it something such as a....METAL
  FENCE!!This is a great conductor and will keep those idiotic kids
  from hopping your fence on there way home from school,or to keep
  those damn dogs out of your yard,but if you have a totally humongus
  fence there won't be enough electricity to go all the way around
  and the most you could feel is a slight tingle of electric.


    Another thing that is fun to play with is capicitors,these little
  devils can be real fun and cause a little bit of damage(Maybe).
  Just take one of the bastards,not the tiny kind,go to raidio shack
  and buy some at least half an inch wide and all that,take the
  extension cord from above and hook it up to the capicitor,make
  sure you are a waze back because this thing can splatter.If you
  take one and charge it PROPERLY you can throw it at a geek walking
  down the street and give him a shock he may not soon forget.


    Hmmmm...What else could we do?? Oh yeah!!! You could take
  someone's electric and pull out one of the heat terminals and pull
  the wires out of them,this will give the person sleeping A REAL
  SHOCK!!Your electric blanket packs a lot of electric and should not
  be messed with unless you want to kill someone.


    Welp,since this is a subject I am just learning about I will end
  the file here because there are more dangerous things I know to do
  but I will not discuss them untill I learn more on the subject
  because I don't want anyone getting fucked up because I gave them
  incorrect information.


    I am sure you can think of more stuff to add to this file and all
  that and you should be able to use your imagination to think up
  other ways to cause physical harm to other people,if you have any
  ideas or anything you would like everyone to see send it to me!


  This concludes my phile on electric fun so SEE YA!!!

                         The Full Book of Anarchy
                            By The Dark Angel of
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    Introduction.....Well,this book was basiclly made for me so I
    could just have a listing a my favorit explosives so I wouldn't
    have to go through all of my anarchy files to find one. So here
    are my favorite recipies........


    Hold on...Gotta take up alot of page space.....

    Credits:
    This book contains excerpts from many anarchy books I have came
    by in my time as a pyrotechnition.So please don't sue me if I
    have something from your book...

    Disclaimer:
    I am in no way responsible if you get in any trouble using this
    phile or get your face blown off....

======================================================================

    Flash Powder : It's so cool..... These are just a few of my
    favorite flash powder recipies.


    1. This is my favorite,it's real loud and four ounces of it
       equal one stick of dynamite.

    Potassium Perchlorate ---- 2 oz
    Aluminum Powder (98% -400) 1 oz


    2. This is what they use in M-80's

    Potassium Perchlorate --- 2 oz
    Aluminum Powder (70% -400)1 oz


    3. This stuff is cool,it's slightly friction and impact sensitive
       and will blow up when it gets wet...

    Potassium Permangate --- 2 oz
    Sulfur ----------------- 1 oz
    Aluminum Powder -------- 1 oz

======================================================================

    Page 2

    Miniture Claymore Bomb

    Materials Needed

    Potassium Chlorate
    Nitrobenzene
    Double sided tape
    Small Alnico 5 Horseshoe magnets
    A lot a 1/4 inch ball berings,or bb's 
    Epoxy Resin
    Measuring Cup
    Two soap dishes


    How to make

    Crush potassium chlorate into a fine powder
    
    Fill the top half of the soap dish to a depth of 3/4 inch with 1/4
    inch ball berings held together with a light coat of epoxy resin

    Now cut a hole in the bottom half and fill it with the potassium  
    chlorate leaving no room and cover it with tape. The hole
    should be big enough for you to pour nitrobenzene into later and
    big enough to fit a detonator into.

    Now tape the two pieces together tightly and your done.

    How to use--When ready to use just pour the nitrobenzene into the
    hole,the correct ratio is 1 part by volume of nitrobenzene to 4
    parts by volume of potassium chlorate.Keep track of this or you
    won't get optimun results.

    Now allow the nitrobenzene to soak for about 6 minutes and then
    insert your detonator into the hole,now seal around the hole with
    expoxy resin.

    Now use the magnets and tape to attace the bomb about 3 or 4 feet
    (I prefer doing very close to ground to take of people's feet
    to make them suffer)above the groun ball berings facing outward


    This is real fun to watch,but be careful,this thing has a kill
    range of 50 yards!

======================================================================

Shotgun shell impact grenade...

    Materials
    Potassium Chlorate
    Nitrobenzene
    12 guage shotgun shell
    Wood dowle or steel bar 11/16 inch in diameter and any lenght
         beyond 1/2 inch
    Drill with 1/4 inch bit
    Epoxy resin
    Electric tape (Black tape)
    Steel ball bering 3/8 inch diameter

    How to make

    Empty out a shot gun shell saving only the casing

    To ensure the mini detonator is centered use the hacksaw to cut
    a 1/2 inch length of 11/16 inch steel bar or wooden dowel. Now
    drill a 1/4 inch hole in the center of the dowel or steel bar.
    
    After the guide has been prepared then glue it in place on the
    primer itself.Now place the minicompound detonator open side down
    in the cylindar glue it into place.Now fill the remaining space
    in the shotgun shell with potassium chlorate *** CAREFULLY ***
    Now close of the end with tape and when ready to use simply pour
    in the nitrobenzene activator
 
    After this,tape a 3/8 inch ball bering over the primer on the out
    side of the shell over the primer

    Now tape nails around the shell with notches filed 1/4 inch apart
    all along them

    How to use

    Pour nitrobenzene into the upside of the shell and then let it
    soak for a few minutes.To use just throw at a group of people
    and upon impact it will detonate itself

     There are many other uses for this I'm sure you could think of.

======================================================================

    Page 4

    To make a handy dandy little banger just mix potassium chlorate
    and petrouleum jelly in a one to one ratio and let it dry,when
    dry it becomes very sensitive,just throw it at something and
    it will detonate,it's cool.

    To make a grenade launcer,just find a compund bow,an aluminum
    arrow and some gunpowder(FFFF works best) I like to use flash
    powder formula number one discussed earlyer in this issue because
    it is a lot more powerful...Take the tip off of the arrow,and 
    fill the hollow part with gunpowder or flashpowder. Then pack it
    in,make sure it is full to the tip. Then glue a shot gun shell
    primer onto the end of the arrow(4 10 works best) and glue a
    ball bering or bb to the primer.Then aim and shoot!!!But be
    careful,it throws shrapnell everywhere,this is good at night.

    To make a flame thrower out of you car do this...Take a drill
    and drill a hole big enough for a sparkplug to fit into about
    4 or 5 inches back on your exaust pipe.Then take a switch and
    run insulated wire from the battery of your car to one end of
    the switch,then one wire from the switch to the sparkplug.
    Then simply flip the switch while your car is running and viola!

    To make some bombs out of matches read this....
    Take a bolt with two nuts on it and put a bunch of STRIKEANYWHERE
    matches and tighten the nuts together with the matches in between
    the nuts,and throw the bolt,it's good for raising a little bit of
    hell,and stuff like that.

    To make a tennis ball bomb.cut a hole in a tennis ball about 1/4
    inch wide,and fill with STRIKEANYWHERE matches or gun powder or
    flash powder(Impact sensitive one),then when you see someone
    you don't like or just want to get some attention throw that bitch
    as far away from you as you can and BOOOM!!
