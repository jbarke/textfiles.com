of these formulas are VERY dangerous!


FLASH POWDER
------------

Flash powder is a chemical mixture
that burns so fast that it appears to
burn instantly, producing a bright
flash of light.

Flash powder will produce an extremely
loud explosion in amounts larger than
4 ounces even when it is not contained
Very small amounts of flash powder
will produce a very loud explosion when
contained, even in a container made of
a few layers of paper.

Flash powder is usually made from a
very fine powdered metal that will burn
and an oxidizer.  Powdered aluminum is
used the most because it is cheaper.
Powdered magnesium and zinc will also
work.  The oxidizer can be Barium
Nitrate, Ammonium Perchlorate, Barium
Peroxide, Strontium Nitrate, Potassium
Chlorate, Potassium Perchlorate, Sodium
Chlorate, Potassium Permanganate,
others, and any combination of these.
All the Chlorate are friction and
impact sensitive, and also the Perman-
ganate.  Potassium Perchlorate is the
least sensitive of the Chlorates.

All the chemicals should be crushed
into a very fine powder, about 400 Mesh
or smaller.  400 Mesh is about like
kitchen type flour.

Black German Aluminum is a brand name
for aluminum powder. It has a partical
size of 600 Mesh for 98% of the
aluminum material. The other 2% of the
material is larger than 600 Mesh.
There are other aluminum powders made
by other companies that are equal to
or better than Black German Aluminum.

Aluminum Pyro Powder is also a brand
name.  The partical size is (98%-400)
or 98% of the material is smaller than
400 Mesh. The other 2% is larger than
400 Mesh.


FLASH POWDER FORMULAS
---------------------

1. This formula is one of the best. It
   produces a very, very, extremely
loud explosion.  Easy to ignite with a
fuse.  It is not moisture absorbent.
Not very sensitive to impact or
friction. Sodium Chlorate or Potassium
Chlorate can be used instead of
Potassium Perchlorate but it then
becomes very sensitive to friction and
impact.  4 ounces of this mixture will
produce an explosion equal to one stick
of dynamite!

Potassium Perchlorate           2 oz.
Aluminum Powder 600 Mesh        1 oz.

2. This formula produces and extremely
   loud explosion, almost as good as
formula #1. This is what most fire-
crackers, M-80's and other fireworks
are made with.

Potassium Perchlorate           2 oz.
Aluminum Powder 400 Mesh        1 oz.

3. This formula is equal to formula #2
   It is not sensitive to friction or
impact.

Barium Peroxide                 9 oz.
50%/50% Magnesium aluminum
powder 200 Mesh                 1 oz.

4. This formula works as good as
   formula #2 but it produces a very
bright flash. This formula is what use
to be used for the photo flash for the
old box type cameras about 100 years ago

Barium Nitrate                  3 oz.
Potassium Perchlorate           3 oz.
Aluminum Powder 400 Mesh        4 oz.

5. This formula works very good. It is
   not very impact or friction
Sensitive. It produces a very, very
loud explosion.  Potassium Perchlorate
contains 46.1914% oxygen. Half as
powerful as #2.

Potassium Perchlorate           2 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.
Aluminum Powder 400 Mesh        1 oz.

6. This formula works as good as #5 but
   it has a disadvantage of being
moisture absorbent and it is very
impact and friction sensitive. Sodium
Chlorate contains 45.0937% oxygen.
Produces a very, very loud explosion.
Equal to #5.

Sodium Chlorate                 2 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.
Aluminum Powder 400 Mesh        1 oz.

7. This formula is very dangerous
   because it is very sensitive to
friction and impact and could explode
during the construction of any
explosive device. Potassium Chlorate
contains 39.1664% oxygen. This formula
produces and explosion almost equal to
#5 or #6. Used in the manufacture of
toy cap pistol caps.

Potassium Chlorate              2 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.
Aluminum Powder                 1 oz.

8. This formula is very, very very
   sensitive to impact, friction and
static electricity, even more sensitive
than #7. Extremely dangerous! Will
ignite even when wet.

Potassium Chlorate              6.7 oz.
Red Phosphorus                  2.7 oz.
Sulfur                          0.3 oz.
Calcium Carbonate               0.3 oz.

9. This formula has slightly less
   explosive power than #7. It is
slightly friction and impact sensitive.
Potassium Permanganate contains
40.4961% oxygen. This formula will
ignite itself if it gets wet. Very loud
explosion.

Potassium Permanganate          2 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.
Aluminum Powder                 1 oz.

10. This formula produces a very small
    explosion when ignited in a paper
tube. A much louder explosion is
produced when it is ignited in a very
strong container. It is impact and
friction sensitive.

Potassium Chlorate              7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                   1.5 oz.
Sulfur                          1.0 oz.

11. No information is available about
    this formula.

Potassium Chlorate              6 oz.
Antimony Sulfide                3 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.

12. This formula is a little louder
    than formula #10. Impact and
friction sensitive. Produces a small
explosion in a paper container.

Sodium Chlorate                 7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                   1.5 oz.
Sulfur                          1.0 oz.

13. No information is available about
    this formula.

Potassium Chlorate              7.5 oz.
Gallic acid                     2.2 oz.
Red gum                         0.3 oz.


!CAUTION!
---------

The mixture of any chlorate with
phosphorus or sulfur is extremely
sensitive to friction and percussion
and explodes with great violence.

Chlorate explosives must not be stored
together with ammonium nitrate
explosives, since ammonium chlorate
which is formed when these two
substances are brought in contact,
explodes.

When mixing chlorate explosives, crush
all of the chemicals separately. Sift
the oxidizer through a piece of screen
wire to break up the material into
small pieces. Then sift the other
chemicals also if they need it.

Mix all of the flash powder chemicals
together and mix well by sifting them
through a piece of screen wire or by
shaking them in a ZIP LOCK bag. This
mixture is very sensitive to friction,
impact, heat, spark, static electricity

4 ounces of flash powder has the same
explosive power as one stick of
dynamite. One gross of M-80 fire-
crackers is equal to 3 sticks of
dynamite.

8 ounces of flash powder will make 100
M-80 type firecrackers if each M-80
contains 1/2 teaspoon of flash powder.

M-80's with 1/4 teaspoon of flash
powder produces an explosion that sound
almost exactly the same as M-80's with
1/2 teaspoon of flash powder, but it
has less destructive power.

24 ounces of flash powder will make
100 M-100 type firecrackers. (And
these are awsome!)

Quick Conversions:

3 teaspons = 1 tablespoon
4 tablespoons = 1/4 cup
1/4 cup = 2 oz.


M-80 & M-100 CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------

1. PLUG ONE END OF THE PAPER TUBE.
Run a small amount of Elmer's glue
around the side of an end plug or the
inside edge of the paper tube.  Insert
the end plug, convex side first, into
the paper tube. Push it in until the
back edge of the plug is flush with
the edge of the paper tube.

2. FUSE THE PAPER TUBE.
Using a 1/8 inch drill bit, an ice
pick or a sharp nail, punch a hole
through one side of the paper tube in
the middle. NEVER puncture a case that
contains flash powder. The paper tube
should always be fused before the
flash powder is added. Cut the fuse to
1 1/2 inches in length and insert it
into the hole at least halfway across
the inside diameter of the paper tube.
Run a small amount of Elmer's glue
around the fuse and let it dry.

3. MIXING THE FLASH POWDER
Extreme caution should be used when
mixing flash powder. Flash powder is
extremely dangerous and explodes with
great force. Avoid all sources of
friction, impact, flame, sparks and
static electricity.

4. FILL THE PAPER TUBES
Stand the paper tubes on end, open end
up. Using a small funnel and a
measuring spoon 1/2 teaspoon, fill the
paper tubes 1/2 to 2/3 full. Do not
fill the tubes completely full or pack
in the flash powder. By leaving an air
space there is room for the flash
powder to expand when ignited which
will produce a much louder explosion.

5. INSERT THE FINAL END PLUG
Plug the open end in the same way that
you plugged the first end.

CHEMICALS
---------

Most of the chemicals you need are
sold at K-mart, hardware stores, drug
stores, lumber yards, plumbing supply,
Wall-mart, cement company and many
other stores.

Sodium Chlorate. O2 solid oxygen
pellets are used in small work shop
torches.

Potassium Nitrate. Sold by most drug
stores in 4 ounce bottles. Also sold
by farmers co-op supply stores.

Sulfur. Sold by farmers co-op, drug
stores and lawn and garden centers.

Aluminum Powder. Sold by paint stores
and auto parts stores. Aluminum powder
can be found in radiator stop leak.

Sodium Nitrate. Sold by drug stores
and meat packing plants.

Antimony Sulfide. Is sold by most
plumbing supply stores.

Potassium Permanganate. It is used
for water treatment. Check you phone
book for water treatment equipment
and supplies.

Ammonium Nitrate. Can be bought from
any farmers co-op or lawn and garden
center.

Red Phosphorus. The white tip on wooden
kitchen matches contains red phosphorus

Check your phone book yellow pages for
industrial chemical supplies, they will
usually have most of these chemicals.

When you call, tell them you are with
a beginning rock band and want it for
some special effects on stage. They
will fall for that every time...

Now you probably wonder where you can
get the paper tubes and end caps. Ok
just write:

FULL AUTO CO. INC.
P.O. Box 1881
Murfreesboro, TN. 37133

And ask for a catalog. M-80 size tubes
are 100-$5. End plugs are 200-$3.5
M-100 size tubes are 100-$9. End plugs
are 200-$5.  You must have an order
form to order this. They also sell
all the chemicals you need to make
flash powder.  You must be over 21
or at least sign the order that
says that you are 21.  There is no way
that they can find out.  I DO NOT
suggest that you buy their water proof
fuse because it sucks!  Go to a gun
shop in your area and ask for cannon
fuse.  It's probably around 35 to 40
cents a foot and is water proof and
MUCH better quality.  You do have to
be 16 or 18 to buy it.
