                              Super Bottle Rockets

    Go down to a hobby shop and buy some Estes rocket engines and some small
dowels, you can make these babies.  Attach the dowel to the rocket casing with
tape or glue and be SURE to plug you the top end of the engine so you get a
bigger bang for your money.  Epoxy works well for this.  The great thing about
it is that they go VERY FAST and VERY FAR.  The speed is enough to knock out
anything easily.  You can go for A, B, C, or D engines but remember that the
heavier and more powerful the engine, the longer the dowel you will need.  Buy
the C6-7 engines with a 6 second burn and 7 second delay for discharge.
