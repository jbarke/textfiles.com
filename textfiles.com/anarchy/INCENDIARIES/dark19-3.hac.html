                            Pretext:

     The author and co-authors of this document, and authors of
the enclosed articles take absolutely no responsibilyity for the
actions taken by the readers of this file. The readers are
assumed to be of whole mind and competancy, so as not to warrant
the punishment of anyone for committing any act herein described.
     This file was composed as a documentary article, and in no
way reflects the author's views on law enforcement, its officers,
or its purpose. This article is an informative look at the other
side. The readers do not have to nor are expected to take part in
any of the acts herein described.
     Inside this file one will find many detailed descriptions on
how to get anything you ever wanted for free, how to make others
pay for your goodies, how to destroy any thing and anyone at
will, and how to reek havoc upon the populus. The author does not
condone this sort of action, and suggests that those who really
want to do this should read no further, and go see a doctor.
Those who shun the thought of my even compiling this file should
stop fucking reading this and delete it, since it won't do well
sitting next to all your other pristine files on how to track
hackers, and how to protect yourself from setting eyes upon
pornography(*). 
     I hereby denounce this article and have decided to delete it
from my drive, hopefully before I get the urge to upload it to
the unsuspecting populus. Those concerned with my actions, rest
your eyes, type: DEL DARK19-?.TXT <CR> at the DOS prompt, and get
some sleep.
     
     Now that those assholes are gone, everyone else come back,
all others should read on(including the guys I told to see a
doctor). Enjoy this documentation, it is the result of many
sleepless nights, many hours of downloading, buffering, and CHATs
to get the necessary information for you all. By the time you
read this I will probably have about 40-60k more of texts to add
to the file, as I have sitting in front of me a few articles on
jailbreak, car theft, atombombs (<--most humorous article, a must
read.), radar guns, unemployment checks while you still have a
job, free food, anti-police warfare, phreaking(@), knife
fighting, the making of viruses (comes complete with a starter
kit/file) etc. I'm sure you'll all enjoy these, but for now, just
read the ones here, it will take you long enough as it is.

(*) oh yeah, PORNOGRAPHY--->definition--from 'porno-graphos'
Greek or something for 'the writing of the prostitutes'. Nice
writing I assume.  
(@) There are some articles on phreaking here, but I have
more....

                             (cont.)

     
     Read the articles carefully on phreaking and on hacking, it
is important that you do not get caught trying out any of these
things. There are some non-hacker/pirate articles here, such as
the noise filter to rid yourself of linenoise forever, but I felt
it was important to the hacker, and even to the amatuer. 
     Most all of the articles enclosed can be done with little
expended money, some more than others. The only articles that do
not say how to build them, such as the HBO decoder and the RADAR
jammer are stored as .ZIP files in the DRKSTRM?.ZIP. These are
for you to read, and decide whether or not you want to spend the
money to get them. I would assume that the guys have been shut
down, so I have been looking for a replacement for the RADAR text
(I already have a couple of HBO texts on how to make em.)
     The only other stuff in here that claims to tell how to
build something that doesn't is the couple of articles on Blue
Boxing, (#'s 1-3), they are VERY informative to the newcomer, and
I left them ther for the reading, besides, the texts on how to
build the Pearl Box and a bunch of others will allow you to make
the Blue Box tones. Some of my own advice for you: Make the Gold
Box, NEVER EVER make a Blotto Box, unless you wish to get a
lawsuit shoved so far up your asshole that you'll be tasting it
in your mouth for years to come. And unless you're extrememely
demented, don't make a Urine Box.
     I am looking for the file "Jane's All The World's Boxes", if
anyone has it, please upload it to any BBS I'm on, I would like
to include it in my next issue of DRKSTRM. It has many many more
boxes that are not listed here, nor anywhere else to my
knowledge. (To the authors of Jane's ATWB, I only plan to use a
few of the better ones, I will not include it all.) [Still
looking....]
     The HBO file on page 123 works great. I use it now, and it's
fine. 
     Also, if you have any intention of doing anything mentioned
in this documnet, read the articles on it carefully. As in the
instance of the two Carding texts, the first says how to do it,
but yet, if you read the second one, you will realize that had
you tried it now, you would probably be sitting in a dingy cell
with a big Samoan named Biff who wants to make you his wife.
     Go nuts!
     Have a Hell of a time!

                    -----------------------


     To the United States of America, for allowing me the freedom
of expression, that of speech, and that of the press, which thus
granted me the right to publish this article. (Sort of.)
     {Not like I wouldn't have published it if it were illegal}
     But thanks anyway; it's the thought that counts.



                     One Last note (I Hope)
                     ----------------------
     Most of the BBS numbers have been left attached to the
files, that is, accept for the Police Station, which I think only
appears once, but no matter, you can still call most of these
BBS's even if all their articles are not properly denoted. 
     You can find most of these articles, plus many more on any
of the BBS's mentioned in this file, and on many others not
mentioned here. Many good BBS's have message sections devoted to
Law and Lawlessness.



                             Oh Yeah
                             -- ----
     Almost forgot, this is a fairly good size article, so you
might want to use a Search program, or one with a Search (and
replace) key in it. Search in the forward direction from the
Table of Contents for 'Page ###' and it will get you there faster
than you can. In my next issue, or in a few at least, I will
divide it up a bit so you can load some of it, or discard or
whatever to make it better for you. (Did it this time....)

                   BUG FREQUENCIES AND SUCH
                   ------------------------


Frequencies used by wireless microphones, transmitters, bugging
devices, surveillance etc.
These frequencies have been compiled by a few sources, Monitoring
Times, Popular Communications and friends.
They are some of the known frequencies in use by transmitters
used by entertainers or in law enforcement applications.
A good idea to do is put these in your scanner and do a random
scan around your house, or go driving around your town and see
what comes up.

Possibles of using these and doing search ranges could show some
interesting results, one example would to be park near a conert
for one and do an extensive search, you would eventually lock
onto the frequencies used by the band which are playing, Hmmm.
Then again you could always come across a bugged
subject.

All frequencies are in Mhz. Some of the cheaper brands that are
being sold today, such as radio shacks, and the ones made for
camcorders are being used by private sources bugging
neighbors, etc. These are easy to covert on telephones , rooms,
etc. All bugging or mics for entertainment use very low wattage, 
you will have to be close to the source.

A COUPLE QUICK NOTES ABOUT SOME OF THE FREQUENCIES
==================================================


WHEN IN THE SCAMBLED MODE , THEY USE DIGITAL ENCRYTION SYSTEM ,
WHICH ON THESE MODELS ARE , MADE BY MOTOROLA. DIGITAL ENC. SOUNDS
LIKE TONES OR BEEPS AND IS NOT VERY EASY TO DESCRAMBLE , REASON
BEING , IS THAT IT IS NOT PHASE INVERSION THE SYSTEM USED BY
SHERIFFS AND OTHERS , DIG. SCRAMBLING USES A PRESET CODE
ON EACH UNIT THIS NUMBER RANGES , SAY 10,000 DIFFERENT
COMBINATIONS COULD BE USED. SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD JUST
SIMPLY HAVE TO TRY EACH AND EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION. THIS
WOULD TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME. PLUS THE FACT THAT THEY 
ARE MORE OR LESS CHANGED PERIODICALLY. WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO
IS HAVE SOME TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT COULD SAMPLE EACH COMBINATION
AT VERY FAST RATES. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SCRAMBLING YOUR
COMMUNICATIONS , BE IT THE PHONE LINES , TWO WAY RADIO , ETC.
PALOMAR MAKES A NICE PHASE INVERSION , CURRENTLY BEING DISCON
TINUED. OR THE DIGITAL ENCRYPTION SYSTEM ALSO MADE BY PALOMER
THIS UNIT SELLS FOR AROUND 400.00. NOTE THAT PHASE INVERSION IS
PRETTY EASY TO CRACK , YOU COULD EVEN RECORD FULL SESSIONS OF A
PHASE INVERTED CONVERSATION , AND THEN LATER DESCRAMBLE IT FROM
YOUR RECORDER.

Due to my own impatience waiting for other H/P magazines to be
released I decided to release this file in solo form.  I am going
to call it BUTLER#1 because there will be updates and additions
to follow.


The Computer Underground consists of mainly two forms of media,
printed and electronic, both will be discussed in this file.  I
use the word underground because the contents of this file are
not the types of titles you would run across at your local
bookstore or newsstand.  The kind of information that
makes up underground publications is mainly technical in nature,
but, definitley not limited to that.  One can also find tidbits
about off-the-wall polical views, drugs, weapons, and other
topics that are not normally in the mainstream of our society.  


The Computer Underground...

Com-put-er Un-der-ground  
           \kem-`pyÅt-er\  \`en-der-`graÅnd\ (1970's)

  A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind aliases, to promote
the free  exchange of information regarding anything and
everything including but not limited to: Computers, Telephones,
Radios, Chemicals, and ideas.


The CU is made up of men and women all over the globe and of all
ages.  Most of those involved in the CU consider it a hobby, but,
there are those that are involved strictly for illegal purposes,
i.e. Selling Pirated Software.  I, like most people involved
enjoy the information that can be obtained through all of the
different avenues in the CU, i.e. Bulletin Boards, Underground 
Periodicals, Network Digests, and General Discussions between
members.

Page 141



The most common way members communicate is through Bulletin
Boards.  If you are reading this you know what a BBS is because
this will not be released in printed form.  There are thousands
of BBSes around the world run by people for many reasons
including: legitmate businesses, Software Technical Support,
Hobby related, Pirated Software, Message Centers, etc...Some of
the more common ones are RIPCO, Face-2-Face, Exec-PC, The Well,
etc...

Currently there are many regular electronic magazines that are
being published and there have been many that have discontinued
for one reason or another.
  
Some current ones include: PHRACK, NIA, PHANTASY, CUD, etc...Some
discontinued ones include: PIRATE, PHUN, NARC, etc... 

There is a current debate about wether or not an electronic media
has the same constitutional rights as the printed one.  That is
for our congressmen to decide, but, you could voice your opinion.

I personally can't see the difference.  Now, don't get me wrong I
do not support the publishing of Long distance codes or anything
of that nature, but, I do support the exchange of other
information, i.e. how to unprotect a game, how to make a smoke
bomb, etc...

There are also "Underground Publications" like TAP, 2600,
Cybertech, etc.  These magazines are published in hard copy and
deal with every considerable topic regarding the CU.  Most of
these magazines publish completely legal information that is
obtained from public sources and is available to anyone
and everyone.

I doubt that any of the following sources of information would
mind if you use an alias to order any of their material, so I
would reccommend that you do just in case!  You might even want
to get yourself a private mail box for all of this "underground"
information.  I would also advise you to use a money order when
purchasing anything also.  They usually cost an extra 50 cents at
the post office.  And don't worry about using money orders with
these people because I have personally made purchases from many
of them without trouble.

The following information is provided to enable you to become
more familiar with the CU and unusual information in general. 
Have fun and try not to get yourself in trouble.

Welcome to the Privacy Catalog, Over 300 publications explore
every aspect of privacy in ways that are not only unique, but
also provocative.  Some books may seem "controversial", but that
results only from the fact that people can enjoy many different
views of the same subject.  We endeavor to offer views that will
prove both helpful and thoughtful in the many areas where privacy
may be a concern.

Excerpts from 'Steal This Book' by Abbie Hoffman.
(I doubt Pirate Editions (Publishers) will mind too much seeing
as how most people got this book by stealing it, as is suggested
by the title.... I doubt they expected a profit from it; if they
did, they were wrong.)
Anyway, here it is:
=====>>

                       People's Chemistry
                       -------- ---------

                           Stink Bomb

     You can purchase buteric acid at any chemical supply store
for "laboratory experiments." It can be thrown or poured directly
in an area you think already stinks. A small bottle can be left
uncapped behind a door that opens into the target room. When a
person enters they will knock over the bottle, spilling the
liquid. Called a "Fronies," by those in the know, an ounce of
buteric acid can go a long way. Be careful not to get it on your
clothing. 
     A home-made stink bomb can be made by mixing a batch of egg
whites, Drano, (sodium hydroxide) and water. Let the mixture sit
for a few days in a capped bottle before using.



                           Smoke Bomb

     Sometimes it becomes strategically correct to confuse the
opposition and provide a smoke screen to aid an escape. A real
home-made smoke bomb can be made by combining four parts sugar to
six parts saltpeter (available at all chemical supply stores).
This mixture must then be heated over a very low flame. It willl
blend into a plastic substance. When this starts to gel, remove
from the heat and allow the plastic to cool. Embed a few wooden
match heads into the mass while it's still pliable and attach a
fuse.*
...About a pound of the plastic will produce thick enough smoke
to fill a city block. Just make sure you know which way the wind
is blowing.

(* is under Fuses, Page 156)






Page 154






                           Sterno Bomb

     One of the simplest bombs to make is the converted sterno
can. It will provide some bang and a widely dispersed spray of
jellied fire. Remove the lid from a standard, commercially
purchased can and punch a hold {Hole I assume} in the center big
enough for the firecracker fuse. Take a large spoonful of jelly
out of the center to make room for the firecracker. Insert the
firecracker and pull the fuse up through the hole in the lid.
When in place, cement around the hole with epoxy glue. Put some
more glue around the rim of the can and reseal the lid. Wipe the
can and wash off excess with rubbing alcohol. A cancerette fuse
{cigarette fuse} should be used. The can could also be taped
around a bottle with Moltov mixture and ignited.

Various fuses from 'Steal This Book'



                              Fuses

     You can make a good homemade fuse by dipping a string in
glue and then rolling it lightly in gunpowder. When the glue
hardens, wrap the string tightly and neatly with scotch tape.
This fuse can be used in a variety of ways. Weight it on one end
and drop a rock into the tank of a pig vehicle. Light the other
end and run like hell. 
   {Cops don't like that part though....}






                         Cancerette Fuse
                        {Cigarette Fuse}

     Take a few puffs (being sure not to inhale the vile
fumes){This comming from an acclaimed pot-grower} to get it going
and work the unlighted end over the fuse of a firecracker. {Use
an unfiltered cigarette, or cut off the filter} This will provide
a delay of from 5 to 15 minutes. To use this type of fuse
successfully, there must be enough air in the vicinity so the
flame won't go out. A strong wind would not be good either. When
the cancerette burns down, it sets off the firecracker which in
turn explodes and ignites the bomb or whatever.

A little free money never hurt....




                           Coin Fraud

     Every time you drop a coin into a slot, you are losing money
needlessly. There is at least one foreign coin that is the same
size or close enough that will do the trick for less than a
penny. The following are some of the foreign currencies that will
get you that Coke, call or subway ride.

                       Quarter Size Coins

     URUGUAYAN 10 CENTISIMO PIECE--works in many soda and candy
machines, older telephones (3 slot types), toll machines,
laundromats, parking meters, stamp machines and restroom novelty
machines{You figure that one out}. Works also in some electric
cancerette machines but not most mechanical machines.

     DANISH 5 ORE PIECE--works in 3 slot telephones, toll
machines, laundromats, automats, some stamp machines, and the
Boston Subway. Doesn't work in soda or cancerette machines.

     PERUVIAN 20 CENTAVO PIECE--similar to above.

     MEXICAN 10 CENTAVO PIECE--works in new (one slot) telephones
and some electric cancerette machines, but not in as many places
as the three above.

     ICELANDIC 5 AURAN PIECE--most effective quarter in the
world, even works in change machines. Unfortunately, this coin is
practically impossible to get outside of Iceland and even there,
it is becoming difficult since the government is attempting to
remove it from circulation. {DAMN!}


                         Dime Size Coins

     MALASIAN PENNY--generally works in all dime slots, including
old and new telephones, candy machines, soda machines, electric
machines, stamp machines, parking meters, photocopy machines, and
pay toilets. Does not work in some newer stamp dispensers, and
some mechanical cancerette machines.

     TRINIDAD PENNY--works much like above.



Page 157







                             Washers

     No. 14 brass washer with tape on one side makes a PERFECT
dime. When you get the ones you want, you can get Thousands for
next to nothing and pass them out to your friends.



                         Legalities etc

     All of the coins listed have a currency value of a few
cents, with most less than one penny. Foreign coins work more
regularly than slugs and are non-magnetic, hence cannot be
detected by "slug detector machines." Also unlike slugs, although
they are illegal to use in mahines, they a re perfectly legal to
possess and exchange.


                              Bills

     Xerox copies of both sides of a dollar bill, carefully glued
together, work in most machines that give you change for a
dollar....Fancy that! It's the Treasury Department. Wonder what
they want?

                           Free Calls


     You can make all the free long distance calls you want by
calling your part collect at a pay phone. Just have your friend
go to a prearranged phone booth at a prearranged time. This can
be done on the spot by having the friend call you person to
person. Say you're not in, but ask for the number calling you
since you'll be "back" in five minutes. Once you get the number
simply hang up, wait a moment and call back your friend collect.
The call has to be out of state to work since operators are
familiar with the special extension numbers assigned to pay
phones for her area and possibly for nearby areas as well. if she
asks you if it is a pay phone say no. If she finds out during the
call (which rarely happens) and informs you of this, simply say
you didn't expect the party to have a pay phone in their house
and accept the charges. We never heard of this happening though.

     If there are two pay phones next to each other, you can call
long distance on one and put the coins in the other. When the
operator cuts in and asks you to deposit money, drop the coins in
the one you are not using, but hold the reciever up to the slots
so the operator can hear the bells ring. When you've finished,
you can simply press the return button on the phone with the
coins, and you'll get them back. (Or tape record the sounds etc)
{For this, nowadays, put the reciver up to the earpiece on the
other phone and procede as above stated.}

                      A Note of Enclosures:
                      --------------------


Hz-Generator:
------------

     Accompanying this file is a program I made in Pascal to
produce the MF tones, read the file on which numbers use which
Hz, and the duration. 
     The program deals in Hz and milliseconds, so you should
have no problems with it. The only one I can think of is that you
can only do one sound at a time. Just record each of them
separately for their duration, and then play them back at the
same time to record them on the same tape (For RedBoxing, for
BlueBoxing, you get to improv. I'm not telling how I do it. It
will make you a better hacker if you can solve your own
problems.)


Extra .ZIP's:
------------

     Also in the DRKSTRM?.ZIP are a few other files. FREE.ZIP, 
RADAR.ZIP, and RADAR2.ZIP. 
     I included them in the .ZIP but not the file seeing as how
they are order forms for making Radar Jammers, and getting free
HBO. In this file is a page on how to build an HBO descrammbler
yourself, but I threw the .ZIP in anyway. The Radar ones cost
money, as does the HBO one. I will continue to search for a file
on how to build a jammer to be included in the next file (Sorry,
but it may take longer than I'd hoped. Anyone with the .GIF's of
it, send them to me and I will include them, or retype them.) so
you all don't have to waste your money.


FLAG.BAT:
--------

     FLAG.ZIP contains FLAG.BAT, and FLAG.DOC, two files on
prompts. FLAG.BAT is a BATch file that makes the prompt look like
an American Flag. The .DOC is just a little note I jotted down
for all of you who have the least bit of curiosity on how the
prompts work. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out, but if it
is, leave me mail anywhere you see me, and I'll give you the text
file I wrote on making prompts.

     Well Boys, that's that.

     I hope you enjoyed the fruits of my many hours of buffering,
downloading, and validations to get you all of this. I am hoping
that I was able to compose the most comprehensive file on
lawlessness and fun. Please leave mail to me whenever you can
about stuff in this file, and other suggestions.
     If you have any questions, then just drop me a line, and
I'll be happy to respond to better your understanding of the
quirks of this feible world.
     I have recently downloaded scans (in .GIF form) of the book
"Steal This Book" by a hippie, Abbie Hoffman. In it it says how
to get more free shit, including land, cars, food, and education
(college). As well as anti-police warfare, and growing pot and
other drugs.
     As soon as I can get an OCR program or something, I will put
lots of this in my next version of this file. I have a few
included as last minute adjustments, but the bulk of it is still
to come. Enjoy it while it lasts, and remember the quote from one
of the guys who wrote an article for this file, Maelstrom (I
think)....

     "It's not illegal until you get caught."

     ... or something like that.
     Well, boys, I will leave you now so you can get to work on
any of the stuff in here that tickles youyr fancy. Go Nuts!

     Peace. War. Death. It's all a vicious circle.
