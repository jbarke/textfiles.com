                                   FIREBOMBS

     Most fire bombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a fuel soaked
rag in the bottle's mouth. The original Molotov cocktail, and still about the
best, was a mixture of one part gasoline and one part motor oil. The oil helps
it to cling to what it splatters on.

                                    NAPALM

     About the best fire bomb is napalm. It has a thick consistency, like
jam and is best for use on vehicles or buildings.

     Napalm is simply one part gasoline and one part soap. The soap is
either soap flakes or shredded bar soap. Detergents won't do.

     The gasoline must be heated in order for the soap to melt. The usual
way is with a double boiler where the top part has at least a two-quart
capacity. The water in the bottom part is brought to a boil and the double
boiler is taken from the stove and carried to where there is no flame.

      Then one part, by volume, of gasoline is put in the top part and
allowed to heat as much as it will and the soap is added and the mess is
stirred until it thickens. A better way to heat gasoline is to fill a bath
tub with water as hot as you can get it. It will hold its heat longer and
permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.


                                MATCH HEAD BOMB

     Simple safety match heads in a pipe, capped at both ends, make a
devastating bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse.

     A plastic Baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to prevent
detonation by contact with the metal.


                            FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB

     A four strand home made fuse is used for this. It burns like fury.  It
is held down and concealed by a strip of bent tin cut from a can.  The
exposed end of the fuse is dipped into the flare igniter. To use this one,
you light the fuse and hold the fire bomb until the fuse has burned out of
sight under the tin. Then throw it and when it breaks, the burning fuse will
ignite the contents.
