		       Improvising Black Powder
			   By: Mr. Byte-Zap


  Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner.  It may be used as
blasting or gun powder.

Material required:
-----------------
potassium nitrate, granulated, 3 cups
wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup
alcohol, 5 pints (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
Water, 3 cups
heat source
2 buckets -- each 2 gallon capacity, at least one of which is heat resistant
	     (metal, ceramic, etc.)
Flat window screening, at least 1 ft. Square
large wooden stick
cloth, at least 2 ft. Square


  note:  the above amounts will yield 2 ounds of black powder.	However, only
	 the ratios of the amounts of the ingredients are important.  Thus, for
	 twice as much black powder, double all quantities used.

Procedure:
---------

1) place alcohol in one of the buckets
2) place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant
   bucket.  Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all
   ingredients are dissolved.
3) Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat source and
   stir until small bubbles begin to form.

  Caution:  do not boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any is
	    dry, as on sides of pan, it may ignite.

  4) Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring
     vigorously
  5) let alcohol stand about 5 minutes.  Strain mixture through cloth to obtain
     black powder.  Discard liquid.  Wrap cloth around black powder and squeeze
     to remove all excess liquid.
  6) Place screening over dry bucket.  Place workable amount of damp powder on
     screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen

  note:  if granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape,
	 recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.

  7) Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about 1/2 inch
     is formed.  Allow to dry.	Use radiator , or direct sunlight.  This should
     be dried as soon as possible, preferably in one hour.  The longer the
     drying period, the less effective the black powder.

  Caution:  remove from heat as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder is now
	    ready for use.
