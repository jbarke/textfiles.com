THE BIG BOOK OF MISCHIEF 1.1

Preface

                 
     A couple of years ago, I began compiling a file filled with information
from the world-famous BBS Ripco.  The basis of this file was, of course, THE
TERRORIST'S HANDBOOK,an incredible book that was never published.  Ripco fell
prey to Operation Sundevil.  I printed out two copies of this file: Both went
to friends.  These are the only copies of the original version of this file in
existence.  I suffered a hard disk crash which wiped out the subdirectory in
which my original file resided. Today, August 8th, 1990, at 1 AM, I found a
copy of The Terrorist's Handbook on a BBS, and recombined it with some other
G-files. Hope you like it.  And remember, the First Amendment is not a shield.
Care must be taken to ensure that no law is broken when information is gained
or divulged. I have read every word of this file, and swear that no article of
this document is illegal in any way.

4/12/91 -- New guideline:  If you modify this file, please put the date and 
           info about modifications in the revision history.  This is to
           keep the new versions of the file in order, to aid updating.

Revision history:

1987-1989         Compilation of original file
Early 1990        Original file lost in crash
August 8, 1990    File reborn as The Complete Terrorist
March 31, 1991    In February, I had a major loss of data, but regained TCT
                  from a local BBS.  I did some cosmetic work and killed some
                  redundancies, and renamed the file to TBBOM. Total file size   
                  is now about 172 printed pages. (You may wish to print this    
                  file out and bind it in a binder)
April 12, 1991    File revised by David Richards on Ripco II.  Some deletions
                  and many valuable additions. Message about new additions
                  added to preface.  I (The Editor) felt that the file should
                  have version numbers, so, in light of the additions by 
                  David Richards, the first volume number is 1.1.

PART 1 - The Terrorist's Handbook - Self explanatory. 

                           THE TERRORIST'S HANDBOOK

1.0     INTRODUCTION

     Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies, a division of Chaos Industries (CHAOS), is
proud to present this first edition of The Terrorist's Handbook.  First and
foremost, let it be stated that Chaos Industries assumes no responsibilities
for any misuse of the information presented in this publication.  The purpose
of this is to show the many techniques and methods used by those people in
this and other countries who employ terror as a means to political and social
goals. The techniques herein can be obtained from public libraries, and can
usually be carried out by a terrorist with minimal equipment.  This makes one
all the more frightened, since any lunatic or social deviant could obtain this
information, and use it against anyone.  The processes and techniques herein
SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!  SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH
COULD OCCUR FROM ATTEMPTING TO PERFORM ANY OF THE METHODS IN THIS PUBLICATION.
THIS IS MERELY FOR READING ENJOYMENT, AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR ACTUAL USE!!

Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies feels that it is important that everyone has some
idea of just how easy it is for a terrorist to perform acts of terror; that is
the reason for the existence of this publication.

2.0   BUYING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS

     Almost any city or town of reasonable size has a gun store and a
pharmacy. These are two of the places that potential terrorists visit in order
to purchase explosive material.  All that one has to do is know something
about the non- explosive uses of the materials.  Black powder, for example, is
used in blackpowder firearms.  It comes in varying "grades", with each
different grade being a slightly different size.  The grade of black powder
depends on what the calibre of the gun that it is used in; a fine grade of
powder could burn too fast in the wrong caliber weapon.  The rule is: the
smaller the grade, the faster the burn rate of the powder.


2.01   BLACK POWDER

     Black powder is generally available in three grades.  As stated before, the
smaller the grade, the faster the powder burns.  Burn rate is extremely
important in bombs.  Since an explosion is a rapid increase of gas volume in a
confined environment, to make an explosion, a quick-burning powder is desirable.
The three common grades of black powder are listed below, along with the usual
bore width (calibre) of what they are used in.  Generally, the fastest burning
powder, the FFF grade is desirable.  However, the other grades and uses are
listed below:


     GRADE              BORE WIDTH               EXAMPLE OF GUN
     컴컴              컴컴컴컴컴               컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     F                  .50 or greater           model cannon; some rifles
     FF                 .36 - .50                large pistols; small rifles
     FFF                .36 or smaller           pistols; derringers


     The FFF grade is the fastest burning, because the smaller grade has more
surface area or burning surface exposed to the flame front.  The larger grades
also have uses which will be discussed later.  The price range of black
powder, per pound, is about $8.50 - $9.00.  The price is not affected by the
grade, and so one saves oneself time and work if one buys the finer grade of
powder.  The major problems with black powder are that it can be ignited
accidentally by static electricity, and that it has a tendency to absorb
moisture from the air. To safely crush it, a bomber would use a plastic spoon
and a wooden salad bowl. Taking a small pile at a time, he or she would apply
pressure to the powder through the spoon and rub it in a series of strokes or
circles, but not too hard.  It is fine enough to use when it is about as fine
as flour.  The fineness, however, is dependant on what type of device one
wishes to make; obviously, it would be impracticle to crush enough powder to
fill a 1 foot by 4 inch radius pipe.  Anyone can purchase black powder, since
anyone can own black powder firearms in America.


2.02    PYRODEX


     Pyrodex is a synthetic powder that is used like black powder.  It comes
in the same grades, but it is more expensive per pound.  However, a one pound
container of pyrodex contains more material by volume than a pound of black
powder.  It is much easier to crush to a very fine powder than black powder,
and it is considerably safer and more reliable.  This is because it will not
be set off by static electricity, as black can be, and it is less inclined to
absorb moisture.  It costs about $10.00 per pound.  It can be crushed in the
same manner as black powder, or it can be dissolved in boiling water and
dried.


2.03        ROCKET ENGINE POWDER

     One of the most exciting hobbies nowadays is model rocketry.  Estes is
the largest producer of model rocket kits and engines.  Rocket engines are
composed of a single large grain of propellant.  This grain is surrounded by a
fairly heavy cardboard tubing.  One gets the propellant by slitting the tube
length- wise, and unwrapping it like a paper towel roll.  When this is done,
the grey fire clay at either end of the propellant grain must be removed.
This is usually done gently with a plastic or brass knife. The material is
exceptionally hard, and must be crushed to be used.  By gripping the grain on
the widest setting on a set of pliers, and putting the grain and powder in a
plastic bag, the powder will not break apart and shatter all over.  This
should be done to all the large chunks of powder, and then it should be
crushed like black powder. Rocket engines come in various sizes, ranging from
1/4 A - 2T to the incredibly powerful D engines.  The larger the engine, the
more expensive.  D engines come in packages of three, and cost about $5.00 per
package.  Rocket engines are perhaps the single most useful item sold in
stores to a terrorist, since they can be used as is, or can be cannibalized
for their explosive powder.

2.04       RIFLE/SHOTGUN POWDER

     Rifle powder and shotgun powder are really the same from a practicle
standpoint. They are both nitrocellulose based propellants. They will be
referred to as gunpowder in all future references. Gunpowder is made by the
action of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid upon cotton. This material is
then dissolved by solvents and then reformed in the desired grain size.  When
dealing with gunpowder, the grain size is not nearly as important as that of
black powder. Both large and small grained gunpowder burn fairly slowly compared
to black powder when unconfined, but when it is confined, gunpowder burns both
hotter and with more gaseous expansion, producing more pressure. Therefore, the
grinding process that is often necessary for other propellants is not necessary
for gunpowder.  Gunpowder costs about $9.00 per pound. Any idiot can buy it,
since there are no restrictions on rifles or shotguns in the U.S.

2.05       FLASH POWDER

      Flash powder is a mixture of powdered zirconium metal and various
oxidizers. It is extremely sensitive to heat or sparks, and should be treated
with more care than black powder, with which it should NEVER be mixed. It is
sold in small containers which must be mixed and shaken before use. It is very
finely powdered, and is available in three speeds: fast, medium, and slow. The
fast flash powder is the best for using in explosives or detonators.

     It burns very rapidly, regardless of confinement or packing, with a hot
white "flash", hence its name.  It is fairly expensive, costing about $11.00. It
is sold in magic shops and theatre supply stores.

2.06       AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate is a high explosive material that is often used as a
commercial "safety explosive"  It is very stable, and is difficult to ignite
with a match. It will only light if the glowing, red-hot part of a match is
touching it. It is also difficult to detonate; (the phenomenon of detonation
will be explained later) it requires a large shockwave to cause it to go high
explosive. Commercially, it is sometimes mixed with a small amount of nitro-
glycerine to increase its sensitivity. Ammonium nitrate is used in the "Cold-
Paks" or "Instant Cold", available in most drug stores. The "Cold Paks" consist
of a bag of water, surrounded by a second plastic bag containing the ammonium
nitrate. To get the ammonium nitrate, simply cut off the top of the outside bag,
remove the plastic bag of water, and save the ammonium nitrate in a well sealed,
airtight container, since it is rather hydroscopic, i.e. it tends to absorb
water from the air. It is also the main ingredient in many fertilizers.

2.1     ACQUIRING CHEMICALS

     The first section deals with getting chemicals legally. This section
deals with "procuring" them. The best place to steal chemicals is a college.
Many state schools have all of their chemicals out on the shelves in the labs,
and more in their chemical stockrooms. Evening is the best time to enter lab
buildings, as there are the least number of people in the buildings, and most
of the labs will still be unlocked. One simply takes a bookbag, wears a dress
shirt and jeans, and tries to resemble a college freshman. If anyone asks what
such a person is doing, the thief can simply say that he is looking for the
polymer chemistry lab, or some other chemistry-related department other than
the one they are in. One can usually find out where the various labs and
departments in a building are by calling the university. There are, of course
other techniques for getting into labs after hours, such as placing a piece of
cardboard in the latch of an unused door, such as a back exit. Then, all one
needs to do is come back at a later hour. Also, before this is done,
terrorists check for security systems. If one just walks into a lab, even if
there is someone there, and walks out the back exit, and slip the cardboard in
the latch before the door closes, the person in the lab will never know what
happened. It is also a good idea to observe the building that one plans to rob
at the time that one plans to rob it several days before the actual theft is
done. This is advisable since the would- be thief should know when and if the
campus security makes patrols through buildings. Of course, if none of these
methods are successful, there is always section 2.11, but as a rule, college
campus security is pretty poor, and nobody suspects another person in the
building of doing anything wrong, even if they are there at an odd hour.


2.11     TECHNIQUES FOR PICKING LOCKS

     If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's most
effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer.  There are
unfortu- nately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these
methods. The next best thing, however, is a set of army issue lockpicks.

These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked,
but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The rule
here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several
devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the wall. Dental
tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin pocket-
knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The way that all these
tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the latch
out of its hole in the wall, and pull the door open. This is done by sliding
whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and pulling the latch out
from the wall. To make an aluminum-can lockpick, terrorists can use an aluminum
can and carefully cut off the can top and bottom. Cut off the cans' ragged ends.
Then, cut the open-ended cylinder so that it can be flattened out into a single
long rectangle. This should then be cut into inch wide strips. Fold the strips
in 1/4 inch increments (1). One will have a long quadruple-thick 1/4 inch wide
strip of aluminum. This should be folded into an L-shape, a J-shape, or a U-
shape. This is done by folding. The pieces would look like this:


 (1)

 _______________________________________________________    v 1/4    
|_______________________________________________________|    | 1/4    
|_______________________________________________________|    | 1 inch 1/4    
|_______________________________________________________|    | 1/4    
|_______________________________________________________|    |                   
                                                  ^

     Fold along lines to make a single quadruple-thick piece of aluminum. This
should then be folded to produce an L,J,or U shaped device that looks like this:
                 ________________________________________
                /________________________________________|                       
               | |
               | |          L-shaped
               | |
               | |
               |_|

                       _____________________________
                      / ___________________________|
                     | |
                     | |     J-shaped
                     | |
                     | |________
                      \________|

                       _____________________
                      / ___________________|
                     | |
                     | |
                     | |     U-shaped
                     | |
                     | |____________________
                      \____________________|


     All of these devices should be used to hook the latch of a door and pull
the latch out of its hole.  The folds in the lockpicks will be between the door
and the wall, and so the device will not unfold, if it is made properly.

Addendum 4/12/91

     Another method of forced entry is to use an automobile jack to force the
frame around the door out of shape, freeing the latch or exposing it to the
above methods. This is possible because most door frames are designed with a
slight amount of "give". Simply put the jack into position horizontally across
the frame in the vicinty of the latch, and jack it out. If the frame is wood
it may be possible to remove the jack after shutting the door, which will
relock the door and leave few signs of forced entry.


2.2      LIST OF USEFUL HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY

     Anyone can get many chemicals from hardware stores, supermarkets, and
drug stores to get the materials to make explosives or other dangerous
compounds.  A would-be terrorist would merely need a station wagon and some
money to acquire many of the chemicals named here.

notes: * ethyl alcohol is mixed with methyl alcohol when it is used as a
solvent. Methyl alcohol is very poisonous. Solvent alcohol must be at least
95% ethyl alcohol if it is used to make mercury fulminate. Methyl alcohol may
prevent mercury fulminate from forming.

     + Ammonia, when bought in stores comes in a variety of forms.  The pine
and cloudy ammonias should not be bought; only the clear ammonia should be
used to make ammonium triiodide crystals.

     @ Mercury thermometers are becoming a rarity, unfortunately.  They may be
hard to find in most stores as they have been superseded by alcohol and other
less toxic fillings. Mercury is also used in mercury switches, which are
available at electronics stores. Mercury is a hazardous substance, and should
be kept in the thermometer or mercury switch until used. It gives off mercury
vapors which will cause brain damage if inhaled.  For this reason, it is a
good idea not to spill mercury, and to always use it outdoors. Also, do not
get it in an open cut; rubber gloves will help prevent this.

     ^ Nitric acid is very difficult to find nowadays.  It is usually stolen
by bomb makers, or made by the process described in a later section.  A
desired concentration for making explosives about 70%.


     & The iodine sold in drug stores is usually not the pure crystaline form
that is desired for producing ammonium triiodide crystals. To obtain the pure
form, it must usually be acquired by a doctor's prescription, but this can be
expensive.  Once again, theft is the means that terrorists result to.


2.3      PREPARATION OF CHEMICALS

2.31     NITRIC ACID


       There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids for  
explosives. One method by which it could be made will be presented. Once  
again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
     컴컴컴컴                              컴컴컴컴
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source     
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with stopper

1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of potassium
nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all does not dissolve,
carefully stir the solution with a glass rod until it does.

3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, and place the   
collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating until liquid
begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The liquid that forms is nitric
acid.  Heat until the precipitate in the bottom of the retort is almost dry,
or until no more nitric acid is forming.  CAUTION: If the acid is headed too
strongly, the nitric acid will decompose as soon as it is formed.  This can
result in the production of highly flammable and toxic gasses that may
explode.  It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up, and then get away
from it.

     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black powder,
simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and filtering out the sulfur
and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of potassium nitrate, it would be necessary to
dissolve about 90 g of black powder in about one litre of boiling water. Filter
the dissolved solution through filter paper in a funnel into a jar until the
liquid that pours through is clear. The charcoal and sulfur in black powder are
insoluble in water, and so when the solution of water is allowed to evaporate,
potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.

2.32     SULFURIC ACID

     Sulfuric acid is far too difficult to make outside of a laboratory or
industrial plant.  However, it is readily available in an uncharged car
battery. A person wishing to make sulfuric acid would simply remove the top of
a car battery and pour the acid into a glass container.  There would probably
be pieces of lead from the battery in the acid which would have to be removed,
either by boiling or filtration.  The concentration of the sulfuric acid can
also be increased by boiling it; very pure sulfuric acid pours slightly faster
than clean motor oil.


2.33     AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate is a very powerful but insensitive high-order explosive.
It could be made very easily by pouring nitric acid into a large flask in an ice
bath. Then, by simply pouring household ammonia into the flask and running away,
ammonium nitrate would be formed. After the materials have stopped reacting, one
would simply have to leave the solution in a warm place until all of the water
and any unneutralized ammonia or acid have evaporated. There would be a fine
powder formed, which would be ammonium nitrate. It must be kept in an airtight
container, because of its tendency to pick up water from the air.  The crystals
formed in the above process would have to be heated VERY gently to drive off the
remaining water.


3.0     EXPLOSIVE RECIPES

     Once again, persons reading this material MUST NEVER ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE
ANY OF THE EXPLOSIVES DESCRIBED HEREIN.  IT IS ILLEGAL AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO.  LOSS OF LIFE AND/OR LIMB COULD EASILY OCCUR AS A RESULT
OF ATTEMPTING TO PRODUCE EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS.

     These recipes are theoretically correct, meaning that an individual could
conceivably produce the materials described.  The methods here are usually
scaled-down industrial procedures.







3.01     EXPLOSIVE THEORY

     An explosive is any material that, when ignited by heat or shock,
undergoes rapid decomposition or oxidation.  This process releases energy that
is stored in the material in the form of heat and light, or by breaking down
into gaseous compounds that occupy a much larger volume that the original
piece of material. Because this expansion is very rapid, large volumes of air
are displaced by the expanding gasses.  This expansion occurs at a speed
greater than the speed of sound, and so a sonic boom occurs.  This explains
the mechanics behind an explosion.  Explosives occur in several forms:
high-order explosives which detonate, low order explosives, which burn, and
primers, which may do both.

     High order explosives detonate.  A detonation occurs only in a high order
explosive.  Detonations are usually incurred by a shockwave that passes
through a block of the high explosive material.  The shockwave breaks apart
the molecular bonds between the atoms of the substance, at a rate
approximately equal to the speed of sound traveling through that material.  In
a high explosive, the fuel and oxodizer are chemically bonded, and the
shockwave breaks apart these bonds, and re-combines the two materials to
produce mostly gasses. T.N.T., ammonium nitrate, and R.D.X. are examples of
high order explosives.

     Low order explosives do not detonate; they burn, or undergo oxidation.
when heated, the fuel(s) and oxodizer(s) combine to produce heat, light, and
gaseous products.  Some low order materials burn at about the same speed under
pressure as they do in the open, such as blackpowder. Others, such as
gunpowder, which is correctly called nitrocellulose, burn much faster and
hotter when they are in a confined space, such as the barrel of a firearm;
they usually burn much slower than blackpowder when they are ignited in
unpressurized conditions. Black powder, nitrocellulose, and flash powder are
good examples of low order explosives.


     Primers are peculiarities to the explosive field.  Some of them, such as
mercury filminate, will function as a low or high order explosive.  They are
usually more sensitive to friction, heat, or shock, than the high or low
explosives.  Most primers perform like a high order explosive, except that
they are much more sensitive.  Still others merely burn, but when they are
confined, they burn at a great rate and with a large expansion of gasses and a
shockwave. Primers are usually used in a small amount to initiate, or cause to
decompose, a high order explosive, as in an artillery shell.  But, they are
also frequently used to ignite a low order explosive;  the gunpowder in a
bullet is ignited by the detonation of its primer.

3.1     IMPACT EXPLOSIVES

     Impact explosives are often used as primers.  Of the ones discussed here,
only mercury fulminate and nitroglycerine are real explosives; Ammonium
triiodide crystals decompose upon impact, but they release little heat and no
light.  Impact explosives are always treated with the greatest care, and even
the stupidest anarchist never stores them near any high or low explosives.


3.11    AMMONIUM TRIIODIDE CRYSTALS

     Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals
that decompose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if they
are made with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine.  Such
crystals are said to detonate when a fly lands on them, or when an ant walks
across them. Household ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps
and abrasive agents, so that the crystals will detonate when thrown,crushed,
or heated.  Upon detonation, a loud report is heard, and a cloud of purple
iodine gas appears about the detonation site.  Whatever the unfortunate
surface that the crystal was detonated upon will usually be ruined, as some of
the iodine in the crystal is thrown about in a solid form, and iodine is
corrosive.  It leaves nasty, ugly, permanent brownish-purple stains on
whatever it contacts. Iodine gas is also bad news, since it can damage lungs,
and it settles to the ground and stains things there also.  Touching iodine
leaves brown stains on the skin that last for about a week, unless they are
immediately and vigorously washed off.  While such a compound would have
little use to a serious terrorist, a vandal could utilize them in damaging
property.  Or, a terrorist could throw several of them into a crowd as a
distraction, an action which would possibly injure a few people, but frighten
almost anyone, since a small crystal that not be seen when thrown produces a
rather loud explosion.

    Ammonium triiodide crystals could be produced in the following manner:

     Materials                Equipment
     컴컴컴컴                컴컴컴컴

     iodine crystals          funnel and filter paper

                              paper towels
     clear ammonia
     (ammonium hydroxide,     two throw-away glass jars
      for the suicidal)


1) Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars.  The jars   
must both be throw away because they will never be clean again.

2) Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.

3) Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the
 funnel. The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in every
 basic chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a
 semi-circle is formed.  Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with
 one curved side.  Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place
 the cone into the funnel.

4) After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the   
solution into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.

5) While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar   
to wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.

6) Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper,
and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour.  Make sure that
they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they could
well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet material into about
eight chunks.

7) After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of
duct tape.  Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct tape
together around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself.
Finally, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of scissors, and
store the crystals in a cool dry safe place.  They have a shelf life of about
a week, and they should be stored in individual containers that can be thrown
away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process which  gives
off iodine vapors, which will stain whatever they settle on.  One possible way
to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight containers.  To use
them, simply throw them against any surface or place them where they will be
stepped on or crushed.


3.12      MERCURY FULMINATE


     Mercury fulminate is perhaps one of the oldest known initiating
compounds. It can be detonated by either heat or shock, which would make it of
infinite value to a terrorist.  Even the action of dropping a crystal of the
fulminate causes it to explode.  A person making this material would probably
use the following procedure:

     MATERIALS                  EQUIPMENT
     컴컴컴컴                  컴컴컴컴

     mercury (5 g)              glass stirring rod

     concentrated nitric        100 ml beaker (2)
     acid (35 ml)
                                adjustable heat
     ethyl alcohol (30 ml)      source

     distilled water            blue litmus paper

                                funnel and filter paper


1) In one beaker, mix 5 g of mercury with 35 ml of concentrated nitric acid,   
using the glass rod.

2) Slowly heat the mixture until the mercury is dissolved, which is when the   
solution turns green and boils.

3) Place 30 ml of ethyl alcohol into the second beaker, and slowly and
   carefully add all of the contents of the first beaker to it.  Red and/or
   brown fumes should appear. These fumes are toxic and flammable.

4) After thirty to forty minutes, the fumes should turn white, indicating that
the reaction is near completion.  After ten more minutes, add 30 ml of the
distilled water to the solution.

5) Carefully filter out the crystals of mercury fulminate from the liquid
solution.  Dispose of the solution in a safe place, as it is corrosive    and
toxic.

6) Wash the crystals several times in distilled water to remove as much excess
acid as possible.  Test the crystals with the litmus paper until they are
neutral.   This will be when the litmus paper stays blue when it touches the
wet crystals

7) Allow the crystals to dry, and store them in a safe place, far away from
any explosive or flammable material.


       This procedure can also be done by volume, if the available mercury  
cannot be weighed.  Simply use 10 volumes of nitric acid and 10 volumes of  
ethanol to every one volume of mercury.


3.13       NITROGLYCERINE

     Nitroglycerine is one of the most sensitive explosives, if it is not the
most sensitive.  Although it is possible to make it safely, it is difficult.
Many a young anarchist has been killed or seriously injured while trying to
make the stuff.  When Nobel's factories make it, many people were killed by
the all- to-frequent factory explosions.  Usually, as soon as it is made, it
is converted into a safer substance, such as dynamite.  An idiot who attempts
to make nitroglycerine would use the following procedure:

     MATERIAL               EQUIPMENT
     컴컴컴컴               컴컴컴컴

     distilled water        eye-dropper

     table salt             100 ml beaker

     sodium bicarbonate     200-300 ml beakers (2)

     concentrated nitric    ice bath container
     acid (13 ml)           ( a plastic bucket serves well )

     concentrated sulfuric  centigrade thermometer
     acid (39 ml)
                             blue litmus paper
     glycerine


1) Place 150 ml of distilled water into one of the 200-300 ml beakers.

2) In the other 200-300 ml beaker, place 150 ml of distilled water and about a
spoonful of sodium bicarbonate, and stir them until the sodium bicarbonate
dissolves.  Do not put so much sodium bicarbonate in the water so that some
remains undissolved.

3) Create an ice bath by half filling the ice bath container with ice, and
adding table salt.  This will cause the ice to melt, lowering the overall
temperature.

4) Place the 100 ml beaker into the ice bath, and pour the 13 ml of
  concentrated nitric acid into the 100 ml beaker.  Be sure that the beaker
  will not spill into the ice bath, and that the ice bath will not overflow
  into the beaker when more materials are added to it.  Be sure to have a
  large enough ice bath container to add more ice.  Bring the temperature of
  the acid down to about 20 degrees centigrade or less.
 

5) When the nitric acid is as cold as stated above, slowly and carefully add
  the 39 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the nitric acid.  Mix the two
  acids together, and cool the mixed acids to 10 degrees centigrade.  It is a
  good idea to start another ice bath to do this.

6) With the eyedropper, slowly put the glycerine into the mixed acids, one
 drop at a time.  Hold the thermometer along the top of the mixture where the
 mixed acids and glycerine meet.

      DO NOT ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO GET ABOVE 30 DEGREES CENTIGRADE; IF
        THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THIS TEMPERATURE, RUN LIKE HELL!!!

   The glycerine will start to nitrate immediately, and the temperature will
  immediately begin to rise.  Add glycerine until there is a thin layer of
 glycerine on top of the mixed acids.  It is always safest to make any
 explosive in small quantities.

7) Stir the mixed acids and glycerine for the first ten minutes of nitration,
adding ice and salt to the ice bath to keep the temperature of the solution in
the 100 ml beaker well below 30 degrees centigrade.  Usually, the
nitroglycerine will form on the top of the mixed acid solution, and the
concentrated sulfuric acid will absorb the water produced by the reaction.

8) When the reaction is over, and when the nitroglycerine is well below 30
degrees centigrade, slowly and carefully pour the solution of nitroglycerine
and mixed acid into the distilled water in the beaker in step 1.  The
nitroglycerine should settle to the bottom of the beaker, and the water-acid
solution on top can be poured off and disposed of. Drain as much of the acid-
water solution as possible without disturbing the nitroglycerine.

9) Carefully remove the nitroglycerine with a clean eye-dropper, and place it
into the beaker in step 2.  The sodium bicarbonate solution will eliminate
much of the acid, which will make the nitroglycerine more stable, and less
likely to explode for no reason, which it can do.  Test the nitroglycerine
with the litmus paper until the litmus stays blue.  Repeat this step if
necessary, and use new sodium bicarbonate solutions as in step 2.

10) When the nitroglycerine is as acid-free as possible, store it in a clean    
container in a safe place.  The best place to store nitroglycerine is     far
away from anything living, or from anything of any value.     Nitroglycerine can
explode for no apparent reason, even if it is stored     in a secure cool place.


3.14     PICRATES

     Although the procedure for the production of picric acid, or
trinitrophenol has not yet been given, its salts are described first, since
they are extremely sensitive, and detonate on impact.  By mixing picric acid
with metal hydroxides, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, and evaporating
the water, metal picrates can be formed.  Simply obtain picric acid, or
produce it, and mix it with a solution of (preferably) potassium hydroxide, of
a mid range molarity.  (about 6-9 M)  This material, potassium picrate, is
impact-sensitive, and can be used as an initiator for any type of high
explosive.

3.2      LOW-ORDER EXPLOSIVES

     There are many low-order explosives that can be purchased in gun stores
and used in explosive devices. However, it is possible that a wise wise store
owner would not sell these substances to a suspicious-looking individual. Such
an individual would then be forced to resort to making his own low-order
explosives.

3.21     BLACK POWDER

     First made by the Chinese for use in fireworks, black powder was first
used in weapons and explosives in the 12th century.  It is very simple to
make, but it is not very powerful or safe.  Only about 50% of black powder is
converted to hot gasses when it is burned; the other half is mostly very fine
burned particles.  Black powder has one major problem: it can be ignited by
static electricity.  This is very bad, and it means that the material must be
made with wooden or clay tools.  Anyway, a misguided individual could
manufacture black powder at home with the following procedure:

     MATERIALS               EQUIPMENT
     컴컴컴컴               컴컴컴컴
     potassium               clay grinding bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and clay grinder

       or                         or

     sodium                  wooden salad bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and wooden spoon

     sulfur (10 g)           plastic bags (3)

     charcoal (15 g)         300-500 ml beaker (1)

     distilled water         coffee pot or heat source



1) Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding
 bowl and grind it to a very fine powder.  Do this to all of the potassium or
 sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.

2) Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a
separate plastic bag.

3) Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker,
   and add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.

4) Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium
nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes.  Do this until there is no
more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.

5) On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight.
  Sunlight is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too
  hot, but it is hot enough to evaporate the water.

6) Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe
 container. Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper.  Never
 store black powder in a plastic bag, since plastic bags are prone to generate
 static electricity.


3.22     NITROCELLULOSE

     Nitrocellulose is usually called "gunpowder" or "guncotton".  It is more
stable than black powder, and it produces a much greater volume of hot gas.  It
also burns much faster than black powder when it is in a confined space.
Finally, nitrocellulose is fairly easy to make, as outlined by the following
procedure:


     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
     컴컴컴컴                    컴컴컴컴
     cotton  (cellulose)          two (2) 200-300 ml beakers

     concentrated                 funnel and filter paper
     nitric acid
                                  blue litmus paper
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid

     distilled water



1) Pour 10 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker.  Add to this    10
cc of concentrated nitric acid.

2) Immediately add 0.5 gm of cotton, and allow it to soak for exactly 3   
minutes.

3) Remove the nitrocotton, and transfer it to a beaker of distilled water    to
wash it in.

4) Allow the material to dry, and then re-wash it.

5) After the cotton is neutral when tested with litmus paper, it is ready to   
be dried and stored.

Commercially produced Nitrocellulose is stabilized by:

1. Spinning it in a large centrifuge to remove the remaining acid, which is
recycled.

2. Immersion in a large quantity of fresh water.

3. Boiling it in acidulated water and washing it thoroughly with fresh water.

   If the NC is to be used as smokeless powder it is boiled in a soda solution,
then rinsed in fresh water.

The purer the acid used (lower water content) the more complete the nitration
will be, and the more powerful the nitrocellulose produced.

   There are actually three forms of cellulose nitrate, only one of which is
useful for pyrotechnic purposes. The mononitrate and dinitrate are not
explosive, and are produced by incomplete nitration. If nitration is allowed
to proceed to complete the explosive trinatrate is formed.

3.23     FUEL-OXODIZER MIXTURES

     There are nearly an infinite number of fuel-oxodizer mixtures that can be
produced by a misguided individual in his own home.  Some are very effective
and dangerous, while others are safer and less effective.  A list of working
fuel- oxodizer mixtures will be presented, but the exact measurements of each
compound are debatable for maximum effectiveness.  A rough estimate will be
given of the percentages of each fuel and oxodizer:

================================================================================

NOTE: Mixtures that uses substitutions of sodium perchlorate for potassium      
perchlorate become moisture-absorbent and less stable.

     The higher the speed number, the faster the fuel-oxodizer mixture burns
AFTER ignition.  Also, as a rule, the finer the powder, the faster the rate of
burning.

     As one can easily see, there is a wide variety of fuel-oxodizer mixtures
that can be made at home.  By altering the amounts of fuel and oxodizer(s),
different burn rates can be achieved, but this also can change the sensitivity
of the mixture.

3.24    PERCHLORATES

     As a rule, any oxidizable material that is treated with perchloric acid
will become a low order explosive.  Metals, however, such as potassium or
sodium, become excellent bases for flash-type powders.  Some materials that
can be perchlorated are cotton, paper, and sawdust.  To produce potassium or
sodium perchlorate, simply acquire the hydroxide of that metal, e.g. sodium or
potassium hydroxide.  It is a good idea to test the material to be treated
with a very small amount of acid, since some of the materials tend to react
explosively when contacted by the acid.  Solutions of sodium or potassium
hydroxide are ideal.

3.3     HIGH-ORDER EXPLOSIVES

     High order explosives can be made in the home without too much
difficulty. The main problem is acquiring the nitric acid to produce the high
explosive. Most high explosives detonate because their molecular structure is
made up of some fuel and usually three or more NO2 ( nitrogen dioxide )
molecules.  T.N.T., or Tri-Nitro-Toluene is an excellent example of such a
material.  When a shock wave passes through an molecule of T.N.T., the
nitrogen dioxide bond is broken, and the oxygen combines with the fuel, all in
a matter of microseconds.  This accounts for the great power of nitrogen-based
explosives.  Remembering that these procedures are NEVER TO BE CARRIED OUT,
several methods of manufacturing high-order explosives in the home are listed.

3.31     R.D.X.

     R.D.X., also called cyclonite, or composition C-1 (when mixed with
plasticisers) is one of the most valuable of all military explosives.  This is
because it has more than 150% of the power of T.N.T., and is much easier to
detonate.  It should not be used alone, since it can be set off by a not-too
severe shock.  It is less sensitive than mercury fulminate, or nitroglycerine,
but it is still too sensitive to be used alone.  R.D.X. can be made by the
surprisingly simple method outlined hereafter.  It is much easier to make in
the home than all other high explosives, with the possible exception of
ammonium nitrate.

     ammonium nitrate

1) Place the beaker in the ice bath, (see section 3.13, steps 3-4) and carefully 
   pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into the beaker.

2) When the acid has cooled to below 20 degrees centigrade, add small amounts
  of the crushed fuel tablets to the beaker.  The temperature will rise, and
  it must be kept below 30 degrees centigrade, or dire consequences could
  result. Stir the mixture.

3) Drop the temperature below zero degrees centigrade, either by adding more
  ice and salt to the old ice bath, or by creating a new ice bath.  Or,
  ammonium nitrate could be added to the old ice bath, since it becomes cold
  when it is put in water. Continue stirring the mixture, keeping the
  temperature below zero degrees centigrade for at least twenty minutes

4) Pour the mixture into a litre of crushed ice.  Shake and stir the mixture,
  and allow it to melt.  Once it has melted, filter out the crystals, and
  dispose of the corrosive liquid.

5) Place the crystals into one half a litre of boiling distilled water.
 Filter the crystals, and test them with the blue litmus paper.  Repeat steps
 4 and 5 until the litmus paper remains blue.  This will make the crystals
 more stable and safe.

6) Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry completely
  using them. R.D.X. is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive.

7) Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% R.D.X. (by weight) with 11.1%
 mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin. Kneed these material together in a plastic
 bag. This is a good way to desensitize the explosive.


8) H.M.X. is a mixture of T.N.T. and R.D.X.; the ratio is 50/50, by weight.   
  it is not as sensitive, and is almost as powerful as straight R.D.X.

9) By adding ammonium nitrate to the crystals of R.D.X. after step 5, it
  should be possible to desensitize the R.D.X. and increase its power, since
  ammonium nitrate is very insensitive and powerful. Soduim or potassium
  nitrate could also be added; a small quantity is sufficient to stabilize the
  R.D.X.

10) R.D.X. detonates at a rate of 8550 meters/second when it is compressed to a  
   density of 1.55 g/cubic cm.

3.32      AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate could be made by a terrorist according to the hap-hazard
method in section 2.33, or it could be stolen from a construction site, since
it is usually used in blasting, because it is very stable and insensitive to
shock and heat.  A terrorist could also buy several Instant Cold-Paks from a
drug store or medical supply store.  The major disadvantage with ammonium
nitrate, from a terrorist's point of view, would be detonating it.  A rather
powerful priming charge must be used, and usually with a booster charge.  The
diagram below will explain.

          _________________________________________

          |_______|_______________________________|

     The primer explodes, detonating the T.N.T., which detonates, sending      a
tremendous shockwave through the ammonium nitrate, detonating it.


3.33     ANFOS

     ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution.  An ANFO
solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its tendency to
pick up water vapor from the air.  This results in the explosive failing to
detonate when such an attempt is made.  This is rectified by mixing 94% (by
weight) ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene.  The kerosene keeps
the ammonium nitrate from absorbing moisture from the air.  An ANFO also
requires a large shockwave to set it off.

3.34       T.N.T.

     T.N.T., or Tri-Nitro-Toluene, is perhaps the second oldest known high
explosive. Dynamite, of course, was the first. It is certainly the best known
high explosive, since it has been popularized by early morning cartoons. It is
the standard for comparing other explosives to, since it is the most well
known. In industry, a T.N.T. is made by a three step nitration process that is
designed to conserve the nitric and sulfuric acids which are used to make the
product. A terrorist, however, would probably opt for the less economical one
step method. The one step process is performed by treating toluene with very
strong (fuming) sulfuric acid. Then, the sulfated toluene is treated with very
strong (fuming) nitric acid in an ice bath. Cold water is added the solution,
and it is filtered.


3.35     POTASSIUM CHLORATE

     Potassium chlorate itself cannot be made in the home, but it can be
obtained from labs.  If potassium chlorate is mixed with a small amount of
vaseline, or other petroleum jelly, and a shockwave is passed through it, the
material will detonate with slightly more power than black powder.  It must,
however, be confined to detonate it in this manner.  The procedure for making
such an explosive is outlined below:

     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
     컴컴컴컴                    컴컴컴컴
     potassium chlorate           zip-lock plastic bag
     (9 parts, by volume)

     petroleum jelly              clay grinding bowl
     (vaseline)                          or
     (1 part, by volume)          wooden bowl and wooden spoon

1)  Grind the potassium chlorate in the grinding bowl carefully and slowly,
  until the potassium chlorate is a very fine powder.  The finer that it is
  powdered, the faster (better)  it will detonate.

2)  Place the powder into the plastic bag.  Put the petroleum jelly into the
  plastic bag, getting as little on the sides of the bag as possible, i.e. put
  the vaseline on the potassium chlorate powder.

3)  Close the bag, and kneed the materials together until none of the
  potassium chlorate is dry powder that does not stick to the main glob.  If
  necessary, add a bit more petroleum jelly to the bag.

4)  The material must me used within 24 hours, or the mixture will react to
  greatly reduce the effectiveness of the explosive.  This reaction, however,
  is harmless, and releases no heat or dangerous products.

3.36     DYNAMITE

     The name dynamite comes from the Greek word "dynamis", meaning power.
Dynamite was invented by Nobel shortly after he made nitroglycerine. It was
made because nitroglycerine was so dangerously sensitive to shock. A misguided
individual with some sanity would, after making nitroglycerine (an insane act)
would immediately convert it to dynamite. This can be done by adding various
materials to the nitroglycerine, such as sawdust. The sawdust holds a large
weight of nitroglycerine per volume. Other materials, such as ammonium nitrate
could be added, and they would tend to desensitize the explosive, and increase
the power.  But even these nitroglycerine compounds are not really safe.

3.37     NITROSTARCH EXPLOSIVES

     Nitrostarch explosives are simple to make, and are fairly powerful.  All
that need be done is treat various starches with a mixture of concentrated
nitric and sulfuric acids.  10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to 10
ml of concentrated nitric acid.  To this mixture is added 0.5 grams of starch.
Cold water is added, and the apparently unchanged nitrostarch is filtered out.
Nitrostarch explosives are of slightly lower power than T.N.T., but they are
more readily detonated.


3.38     PICRIC ACID

     Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or T.N.P., is a military
explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less
sensitive explosive, such as T.N.T.  It another explosive that is fairly
simple to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.  Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college
chemistry lab manuals, and is easy to follow.  The main problem with picric
acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts,
such as potassium picrate.  For this reason, it is usually made into a safer
form, such as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D.  A social deviant
would probably use a formula similar to the one presented here to make picric
acid.

2) Put 400 ml of tap water into the 1000 ml beaker or boiling container and   
  bring the water to a gentle boil.

3) After warming the 500 ml flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling
  water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty
  minutes.  After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool for
  about five minutes.

4) Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to
  cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in section 3.13,
  steps 3-4.  Place the 500 ml flask with the mixed acid an phenol in the ice
  bath.  Add 38 ml of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts, stirring the
  mixture constantly.  A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should occur.  When
  the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of the ice bath.

5) Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more
  tap water.  Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water, and
  heat it in the boiling water for 1.5 to 2 hours.

6) Add 100 ml of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice   
  bath until it is cold.

7) Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution
  through the filter paper in the funnel.  Collect the liquid and dispose of
  it in a safe place, since it is corrosive.

8) Wash out the 500 ml flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the
  filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 ml of water, and shake vigorously.

9) Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.

10) Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will    
  react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode
  spontaneously.


3.39     AMMONIUM PICRATE

     Ammonium picrate, also called Explosive D, is another safety explosive.
It requires a substantial shock to cause it to detonate, slightly less than
that required to detonate ammonium nitrate.  It is much safer than picric
acid, since it has little tendency to form hazardous unstable salts when
placed in metal containers.  It is simple to make from picric acid and clear
household ammonia. All that need be done is put the picric acid crystals into
a glass container and dissolve them in a great quantity of hot water.  Add
clear household ammonia in excess, and allow the excess ammonia to evaporate.
The powder remaining should be ammonium picrate.


3.40   NITROGEN TRICHLORIDE

     Nitrogen trichloride, also known as chloride of azode, is an oily yellow
liquid.  It explodes violently when it is heated above 60 degrees celsius, or
when it comes in contact with an open flame or spark.  It is fairly simple to
produce.

1)  In a beaker, dissolve about 5 teaspoons of ammonium nitrate in water. Do
  not put so much ammonium nitrate into the solution that some of it remains
  undissolved in the bottom of the beaker.

2)  Collect a quantity of chlorine gas in a second beaker by mixing
   hydrochloric acid with potassium permanganate in a large flask with a
   stopper and glass pipe.

3)  Place the beaker containing the chlorine gas upside down on top of the
   beaker containing the ammonium nitrate solution, and tape the beakers
   together.  Gently heat the bottom beaker.  When this is done, oily yellow
   droplets will begin to form on the surface of the solution, and sink down
   to the bottom.  At this time, remove the heat source immediately.

    Alternately, the chlorine can be bubbled through the ammonium nitrate    
 solution, rather than collecting the gas in a beaker, but this requires
 timing and a stand to hold the beaker and test tube.

    The chlorine gas can also be mixed with anhydrous ammonia gas, by gently
 heating a flask filled with clear household ammonia.  Place the glass tubes
 from the chlorine-generating flask and the tube from the ammonia-generating
 flask in another flask that contains water.

4)  Collect the yellow droplets with an eyedropper, and use them immediately,    
  since nitrogen trichloride decomposes in 24 hours.


3.41     LEAD AZIDE

     Lead Azide is a material that is often used as a booster charge for other
explosive, but it does well enough on its own as a fairly sensitive explosive.
It does not detonate too easily by percussion or impact, but it is easily
detonated by heat from an igniter wire, or a blasting cap.  It is simple to
produce, assuming that the necessary chemicals can be procured.

   By dissolving sodium azide and lead acetate in water in separate beakers,
the two materials are put into an aqueous state.  Mix the two beakers
together, and apply a gentle heat. Add an excess of the lead acetate solution,
until no reaction occurs, and the precipitate on the bottom of the beaker
stops forming.

   Filter off the solution, and wash the precipitate in hot water. The
precipitate is lead azide, and it must be stored wet for safety. If lead
acetate cannot be found, simply acquire acetic acid, and put lead metal in it.
Black powder bullets work well for this purpose.

3.5     OTHER "EXPLOSIVES"

     The remaining section covers the other types of materials that can be
used to destroy property by fire.  Although none of the materials presented
here are explosives, they still produce explosive-style results.

3.51     THERMITE

     Thermite is a fuel-oxodizer mixture that is used to generate tremendous
amounts of heat. It was not presented in section 3.23 because it does not
react nearly as readily. It is a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum, both
finely powdered. When it is ignited, the aluminum burns, and extracts the
oxygen from the iron oxide. This is really two very exothermic reactions that
produce a combined temperature of about 2200 degrees C. This is half the heat
produced by an atomic weapon. It is difficult to ignite, however, but when it
is ignited, it is one of the most effective firestarters around.

     MATERIALS
     컴컴컴컴

     powdered aluminum (10 g)

     powdered iron oxide (10 g)

1) There is no special procedure or equipment required to make thermit.
 Simply mix the two powders together, and try to make the mixture as
 homogenous as possible.  The ratio of iron oxide to aluminum is 50% / 50% by
 weight, and be made in greater or lesser amounts.


2) Ignition of thermite can be accomplished by adding a small amount of
  potassium chlorate to the thermite, and pouring a few drops of sulfuric acid
  on it.  This method and others will be discussed later in section 4.33.  The
  other method of igniting thermite is with a magnesium strip.  Finally, by
  using common sparkler-type fireworks placed in the thermit, the mixture can
  be ignited.


3.52     MOLOTOV COCKTAILS

     First used by Russians against German tanks, the Molotov cocktail is now
exclusively used by terrorists worldwide. They are extremely simple to make,
and can produce devastating results. By taking any highly flammable material,
such as gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, ethyl or methyl alcohol, lighter
fluid, turpentine, or any mixture of the above, and putting it into a large
glass bottle, anyone can make an effective firebomb. After putting the
flammable liquid in the bottle, simply put a piece of cloth that is soaked in
the liquid in the top of the bottle so that it fits tightly.

 Then, wrap some of the cloth around the neck and tie it, but be sure to leave
a few inches of lose cloth to light. Light the exposed cloth, and throw the
bottle. If the burning cloth does not go out, and if the bottle breaks on
impact, the contents of the bottle will spatter over a large area near the
site of impact, and burst into flame.

Flammable mixtures such as kerosene and motor oil should be mixed with a more
volatile and flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to insure ignition. A mixture
such as tar or grease and gasoline will stick to the surface that it strikes,
and burn hotter, and be more difficult to extinguish. A mixture such as this
must be shaken well before it is lit and thrown


3.53     CHEMICAL FIRE BOTTLE

     The chemical fire bottle is really an advanced molotov cocktail.  Rather
than using the burning cloth to ignite the flammable liquid, which has at best
a fair chance of igniting the liquid, the chemical fire bottle utilizes the
very hot and violent reaction between sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate.
When the container breaks, the sulfuric acid in the mixture of gasoline sprays
onto the paper soaked in potassium chlorate and sugar.  The paper, when struck
by the acid, instantly bursts into a white flame, igniting the gasoline.  The
chance of failure to ignite the gasoline is less than 2%, and can be reduced
to 0%, if there is enough potassium chlorate and sugar to spare.

     potassium chlorate               glass bottle
     (2 teaspoons)                    (12 oz.)

     sugar (2 teaspoons)              cap for bottle, w/plastic inside               
                      with plastic inside

     conc. sulfuric acid (4 oz.)      cooking pan with raised edges

     gasoline (8 oz.)                 paper towels

                                      glass or plastic cup and spoon

1) Test the cap of the bottle with a few drops of sulfuric acid to make sure
  that the acid will not eat away the bottle cap during storage.  If the acid
  eats through it in 24 hours, a new top must be found and tested, until  a
  cap that the acid does not eat through is found.  A glass top is excellent.

2) Carefully pour 8 oz. of gasoline into the glass bottle.

3) Carefully pour 4 oz. of concentrated sulfuric acid into the glass bottle.
  Wipe up any spills of acid on the sides of the bottle, and screw the cap on
  the bottle.  Wash the bottle's outside with plenty of water.  Set it aside
  to dry.

4) Put about two teaspoons of potassium chlorate and about two teaspoons of   
  sugar into the glass or plastic cup.  Add about 1/2 cup of boiling water, or
  enough to dissolve all of the potassium chlorate and sugar.

5) Place a sheet of paper towel in the cooking pan with raised edges.  Fold
  the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium
  chlorate and sugar on it until it is thoroughly wet.  Allow the towel to
  dry.

6) When it is dry, put some glue on the outside of the glass bottle containing
  the gasoline and sulfuric acid mixture.  Wrap the paper towel around the
  bottle, making sure that it sticks to it in all places.  Store the bottle
  in a place where it will not be broken or tipped over.

7) When finished, the solution in the bottle should appear as two distinct
  liquids, a dark brownish-red solution on the bottom, and a clear solution on
  top.  The two solutions will not mix.  To use the chemical fire bottle,
  simply throw it at any hard surface.

8) NEVER OPEN THE BOTTLE, SINCE SOME SULFURIC ACID MIGHT BE ON THE CAP, WHICH   
  COULD TRICKLE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND IGNITE THE POTASSIUM CHLORATE,
  CAUSING A FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION.

9) To test the device, tear a small piece of the paper towel off the bottle,
  and put a few drops of sulfuric acid on it.  The paper towel should
  immediately burst into a white flame.


3.54     BOTTLED GAS EXPLOSIVES

     Bottled gas, such as butane for refilling lighters, propane for propane
stoves or for bunsen burners, can be used to produce a powerful explosion. To
make such a device, all that a simple-minded anarchist would have to do would
be to take his container of bottled gas and place it above a can of Sterno or
other gelatinized fuel, light the fuel and run. Depending on the fuel used,
and on the thickness of the fuel container, the liquid gas will boil and
expand to the point of bursting the container in about five minutes.

 In theory, the gas would immediately be ignited by the burning gelatinized
fuel, producing a large fireball and explosion. Unfortunately, the bursting
of the bottled gas container often puts out the fuel, thus preventing the
expanding gas from igniting.  By using a metal bucket half filled with
gasoline, however, the chances of ignition are better, since the gasoline is
less likely to be extinguished.  Placing the canister of bottled gas on a bed
of burning charcoal soaked in gasoline would probably be the most effective
way of securing ignition of the expanding gas, since although the bursting of
the gas container may blow out the flame of the gasoline, the burning charcoal
should immediately re-ignite it.  Nitrous oxide, hydrogen, propane, acetylene,
or any other flammable gas will do nicely.

Addendum 4/12/91:

  During the recent gulf war, fuel/air bombs were touted as being second only
to nuclear weapons in their devastating effects. These are basically similar
to the above devices, except that an explosive charge is used to rupture the
fuel container and disperse it over a wide area. a second charge is used to
detonate the fuel. The reaction is said to produce a massive shockwave and to
burn all the oxygen in a large area, causing suffocation.

  Another benefit of a fuel-air explosive is that the gas will seep into
  fortified bunkers and other partially-sealed spaces, so a large bomb placed
  in a building would result in the destruction of the majority of surrounding
  rooms, rendering it structurally unsound.

4.0     USING EXPLOSIVES

     Once a terrorist has made his explosives, the next logical step is to
apply them. Explosives have a wide range of uses, from harassment, to
vandalism, to murder. NONE OF THE IDEAS PRESENTED HERE ARE EVER TO BE CARRIED
OUT, EITHER IN PART OR IN FULL!  DOING SO CAN LEAD TO PROSECUTION, FINES, AND
IMPRISONMENT! The first step that a person that would use explosive would take
would be to determine how big an explosive device would be needed to do
whatever had to be done. Then, he would have to decide what to make his bomb
with. He would also have to decide on how he wanted to detonate the device,
and determine where the best placement for it would be. Then, it would be
necessary to see if the device could be put where he wanted it without it
being discovered or moved. Finally, he would actually have to sit down and
build his explosive device. These are some of the topics covered in the next
section.

4.1     SAFETY

     There is no such thing as a "safe" explosive device.  One can only speak in
terms of relative safety, or less unsafe.


4.2     IGNITION DEVICES

     There are many ways to ignite explosive devices.  There is the classic
"light the fuse, throw the bomb, and run" approach, and there are sensitive
mercury switches, and many things in between.  Generally, electrical
detonation systems are safer than fuses, but there are times when fuses are
more appropriate than electrical systems; it is difficult to carry an
electrical detonation system into a stadium, for instance, without being
caught.  A device with a fuse or impact detonating fuse would be easier to
hide.

4.21     FUSE IGNITION

     The oldest form of explosive ignition, fuses are perhaps the favorite
type of simple ignition system.  By simply placing a piece of waterproof fuse
in a device, one can have almost guaranteed ignition.  Modern waterproof fuse
is extremely reliable, burning at a rate of about 2.5 seconds to the inch.  It
is available as model rocketry fuse in most hobby shops, and costs about $3.00
for a nine-foot length.  Fuse is a popular ignition system for pipe bombers
because of its simplicity.  All that need be done is light it with a match or
lighter. Of course, if the Army had fuses like this, then the grenade, which
uses fuse ignition, would be very impracticle.  If a grenade ignition system
can be acquired, by all means, it is the most effective.  But, since such
things do not just float around, the next best thing is to prepare a fuse
system which does not require the use of a match or lighter, but still retains
its simplicity. One such method is described below:


     MATERIALS
     _________

     strike-on-cover type matches

     electrical tape or duct tape

     waterproof fuse

1) To determine the burn rate of a particular type of fuse, simply measure a   
6 inch or longer piece of fuse and ignite it.  With a stopwatch, press the   
start button the at the instant when the fuse lights, and stop the watch when   
the fuse reaches its end.  Divide the time of burn by the length of fuse, and   
you have the burn rate of the fuse, in seconds per inch.  This will be shown   
below:

     Suppose an eight inch piece of fuse is burned, and its complete time     
 of combustion is 20 seconds.

     20 seconds
     컴컴컴컴컴  = 2.5 seconds per inch.
     8 inches

     If a delay of 10 seconds was desired with this fuse, divide the desired     
 time by the number of seconds per inch:

     10 seconds
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴 = 4 inches
     2.5 seconds / inch

NOTE: THE LENGTH OF FUSE HERE MEANS LENGTH OF FUSE TO THE POWDER.  SOME FUSE,
  AT LEAST AN INCH, SHOULD BE INSIDE THE DEVICE.  ALWAYS ADD THIS EXTRA INCH,
  AND PUT THIS EXTRA INCH AN INCH INTO THE DEVICE!!!

2) After deciding how long a delay is desired before the explosive device is
  to go off, add about 1/2 an inch to the premeasured amount of fuse, and
  cut it off.

3) Carefully remove the cardboard matches from the paper match case.  Do not
  pull off individual matches; keep all the matches attached to the cardboard
  base.  Take one of the cardboard match sections, and leave the other one
  to make a second igniter.

4) Wrap the matches around the end of the fuse, with the heads of the matches
  touching the very end of the fuse.  Tape them there securely, making sure
  not to put tape over the match heads.  Make sure they are very secure by
  pulling on them at the base of the assembly.  They should not be able to
  move.


5) Wrap the cover of the matches around the matches attached to the fuse,
  making sure that the striker paper is below the match heads and the striker
  faces the match heads.  Tape the paper so that is fairly tight around the
  matches. Do not tape the cover of the striker to the fuse or to the matches.
  Leave enough of the match book to pull on for ignition.

                   |_|


     The match book is wrapped around the matches, and is taped to itself.     
The matches are taped to the fuse.  The striker will rub against the     
matcheads when the match book is pulled.

6) When ready to use, simply pull on the match paper.  It should pull the
  striking paper across the match heads with enough friction to light them. In
  turn, the burning matcheads will light the fuse, since it adjacent to the
  burning match heads.

4.22     IMPACT IGNITION

     Impact ignition is an excellent method of ignition for spontaneous
terrorist activities.  The problem with an impact-detonating device is that it
must be kept in a very safe container so that it will not explode while being
transported to the place where it is to be used.  This can be done by having a
removable impact initiator.


     The best and most reliable impact initiator is one that uses factory made
initiators or primers. A no. 11 cap for black powder firearms is one such
primer. They usually come in boxes of 100, and cost about $2.50. To use such a
cap, however, one needs a nipple that it will fit on. Black powder nipples are
also available in gun stores. All that a person has to do is ask for a package
of nipples and the caps that fit them.  Nipples have a hole that goes all the
way through them, and they have a threaded end, and an end to put the cap on. A
cutaway of a nipple is shown below:

                          ________________
                         |                |

       |____            |
            | |^^^^^^^^^|
            |_|         |/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/|
                        |                 |
                        |_________________|


     When making using this type of initiator, a hole must be drilled into
whatever container is used to make the bomb out of. The nipple is then screwed
into the hole so that it fits tightly. Then, the cap can be carried and placed
on the bomb when it is to be thrown. The cap should be bent a small amount
before it is placed on the nipple, to make sure that it stays in place.  The
only other problem involved with an impact detonating bomb is that it must
strike a hard surface on the nipple to set it off. By attaching fins or a
small parachute on the end of the bomb opposite the primer, the bomb, when
thrown, should strike the ground on the primer, and explode. Of course, a bomb
with mercury fulminate in each end will go off on impact regardless of which
end it strikes on, but mercury fulminate is also likely to go off if the
person carrying the bomb is bumped hard.


4.23     ELECTRICAL IGNITION

     Electrical ignition systems for detonation are usually the safest and
most reliable form of ignition. Electrical systems are ideal for demolition
work, if one doesn't have to worry so much about being caught. With two spools
of 500 ft of wire and a car battery, one can detonate explosives from a
"safe", comfortable distance, and be sure that there is nobody around that
could get hurt. With an electrical system, one can control exactly what time a
device will explode, within fractions of a second. Detonation can be aborted
in  less than a second's warning, if a person suddenly walks by the detonation
sight, or if a police car chooses to roll by at the time. The two best
electrical igniters are military squibs and model rocketry igniters. Blasting
caps for construction also work well. Model rocketry igniters are sold in
packages of six, and cost about $1.00 per pack. All that need be done to use
them is connect it to two wires and run a current through them. Military
squibs are difficult to get, but they are a little bit better, since they
explode when a current is run through them, whereas rocketry igniters only
burst into flame. Military squibs can be used to set off sensitive high
explosives, such as R.D.X., or potassium chlorate mixed with petroleum jelly.
Igniters can be used to set off black powder, mercury fulminate, or guncotton,
which in turn, can set of a high order explosive.


4.24     ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IGNITION

     Electro-mechanical ignition systems are systems that use some type of
mechanical switch to set off an explosive charge electrically.  This type of
switch is typically used in booby traps or other devices in which the person
who places the bomb does not wish to be anywhere near the device when it
explodes. Several types of electro-mechanical detonators will be discussed


4.241     Mercury Switches

     Mercury switches are a switch that uses the fact that mercury metal
conducts electricity, as do all metals, but mercury metal is a liquid at room
temperatures. A typical mercury switch is a sealed glass tube with two
electrodes and a bead of mercury metal. It is sealed because of mercury's
nasty habit of giving off brain-damaging vapors. The diagram below may help to
explain a mercury switch.

                         ______________
                     A  /              \   B
      _____wire +______/_________       \
                       \   ( Hg   )|    /
                        \ _(_Hg___)|___/
                                   |
                                   |
                            wire - |
                                   |
                                   |

     When the drop of mercury ("Hg" is mercury's atomic symbol) touches both
contacts, current flows through the switch.  If this particular switch was in
its present position, A---B, current would be flowing, since the mercury can
touch both contacts in the horizontal position.

     If, however, it was in the | position, the drop of mercury would only
touch the + contact on the A side. Current, then couldn't flow, since mercury
does not reach both contacts when the switch is in the vertical position. This
type of switch is ideal to place by a door. If it were placed in the path of a
swinging door in the verticle position, the motion of the door would knock the
switch down, if it was held to the ground by a piece if tape. This would tilt
the switch into the verticle position, causing the mercury to touch both
contacts, allowing current to flow through the mercury, and to the igniter or
squib in an explosive device. Imagine opening a door and having it slammed in
your face by an explosion.


4.242     Tripwire Switches

     A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap.  By placing a nearly
invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim, and
by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused to occur.
If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one use such a
tripwire to detonate a bomb.  The technique is simple.  By wrapping the tips
of a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing something between
them, and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric tripwire
can be made,  If a piece of wood attached to the tripwire was placed between
the contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a switch.  When
the tripwire was pulled, the clothespin would snap together, allowing current
to flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby completing a circuit,
which would have the igniter or squib in it.  Current would flow between the
contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter or squib, causing it it to
explode.

4.243     Radio Control Detonators

     In the movies, every terrorist or criminal uses a radio controlled
detonator to set off explosives.  With a good radio detonator, one can be
several miles away from the device, and still control exactly when it
explodes, in much the same way as an electrical switch.  The problem with
radio detonators is that they are rather costly.  However, there could
possibly be a reason that a terrorist would wish to spend the amounts of money
involved with a RC (radio control) system and use it as a detonator.  If such
an individual wanted to devise an RC detonator, all he would need to do is
visit the local hobby store or toy store, and buy a radio controlled toy.
Taking it back to his/her abode, all that he/she would have to do is detach
the solenoid/motor that controls the motion of the front wheels of a RC car,
or detach the solenoid/motor of the elevators/rudder of a RC plane, or the
rudder of a RC boat, and re-connect the squib or rocket engine igniter to the
contacts for the solenoid/motor.  The device should be tested several times
with squibs or igniters, and fully charged batteries should be in both he
controller and the receiver (the part that used to move parts before the
device became a detonator).

4.3     DELAYS

     A delay is a device which causes time to pass from when a device is set
up to the time that it explodes.  A regular fuse is a delay, but it would cost
quite a bit to have a 24 hour delay with a fuse.  This section deals with the
different types of delays that can be employed by a terrorist who wishes to be
sure that his bomb will go off, but wants to be out of the country when it
does.


4.31     FUSE DELAYS

     It is extremely simple to delay explosive devices that employ fuses for
ignition.  Perhaps the simplest way to do so is with a cigarette.  An average
cigarette burns for about 8 minutes. The higher the "tar" and nicotine rating,
the slower the cigarette burns. Low "tar" and nicotine cigarettes burn quicker
than the higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, but they are also less likely
to go out if left unattended, i.e. not smoked. Depending on the wind or draft
in a given place, a high "tar" cigarette is better for delaying the ignition
of a fuse, but there must be enough wind or draft to give the cigarette enough
oxygen to burn. People who use cigarettes for the purpose of delaying fuses
will often test the cigarettes that they plan to use in advance to make sure
they stay lit and to see how long it will burn. Once a cigarettes burn rate is
determined, it is a simple matter of carefully putting a hole all the way
through a cigarette with a toothpick at the point desired, and pushing the
fuse for a device in the hole formed.

                            |_| ---------- light this end


     A similar type of device can be make from powdered charcoal and a sheet
of paper.  Simply roll the sheet of paper into a thin tube, and fill it with
powdered charcoal. Punch a hole in it at the desired location, and insert a
fuse. Both ends must be glued closed, and one end of the delay must be doused
with lighter fluid before it is lit. Or, a small charge of gunpowder mixed
with powdered charcoal could conceivably used for igniting such a delay. A
chain of charcoal briquettes can be used as a delay by merely lining up a few
bricks of charcoal so that they touch each other, end on end, and lighting the
first brick. Incense, which can be purchased at almost any novelty or party
supply store, can also be used as a fairly reliable delay. By wrapping the
fuse about the end of an incense stick, delays of up to 1/2 an hour are
possible.
     
Finally, it is possible to make a relatively slow-burning fuse in the home. By
dissolving about one teaspoon of black powder in about 1/4 a cup of boiling
water, and, while it is still hot, soaking in it a long piece of all cotton
string, a slow-burning fuse can be made. After the soaked string dries, it
must then be tied to the fuse of an explosive device. Sometimes, the end of
the slow burning fuse that meets the normal fuse has a charge of black powder
or gunpowder at the intersection point to insure ignition, since the
slow-burning fuse does not burn at a very high temperature. A similar type of
slow fuse can be made by taking the above mixture of boiling water and black
powder and pouring it on a long piece of toilet paper. The wet toilet paper is
then gently twisted up so that it resembles a firecracker fuse, and is allowed
to dry.


4.32     TIMER DELAYS

     Timer delays, or "time bombs" are usually employed by an individual who
wishes to threaten a place with a bomb and demand money to reveal its location
and means to disarm it.  Such a device could be placed in any populated place if
it were concealed properly.  There are several ways to build a timer delay. By
simply using a screw as one contact at the time that detonation is desired, and
using the hour hand of a clock as the other contact, a simple timer can be made.
The minute hand of a clock should be removed, unless a delay of less than an
hour is desired.

     The main disadvantage with this type of timer is that it can only be set
for a maximum time of 12 hours.  If an electronic timer is used, such as that
in an electronic clock, then delays of up to 24 hours are possible.  By
removing the speaker from an electronic clock, and attaching the wires of a
squib or igniter to them, a timer with a delay of up to 24 hours can be made.
All that one has to do is set the alarm time of the clock to the desired time,
connect the leads, and go away.  This could also be done with an electronic
watch, if a larger battery were used, and the current to the speaker of the
watch was stepped up via a transformer.  This would be good, since such a
timer could be extremely small.
 The timer in a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) would be ideal.  VCR's can
usually be set for times of up to a week.  The leads from the timer to the
recording equipment would be the ones that an igniter or squib would be
connected to.  Also, one can buy timers from electronics stores that would be
work well.  Finally, one could employ a digital watch, and use a relay, or
electro-magnetic switch to fire the igniter, and the current of the watch
would not have to be stepped up.


4.33     CHEMICAL DELAYS

     Chemical delays are uncommon, but they can be extremely effective in some
cases.  If a glass container is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid, and
capped with several thicknesses of aluminum foil, or a cap that it will eat
through, then it can be used as a delay.  Sulfuric acid will react with aluminum
foil to produce aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas, and so the container must be
open to the air on one end so that the pressure of the hydrogen gas that is
forming does not break the container.

               |_________________|


     The aluminum foil is placed over the bottom of the container and secured
there with tape.  When the acid eats through the aluminum foil, it can be used
to ignite an explosive device in several ways.

     1) Sulfuric acid is a good conductor of electricity.  If the acid that
  eats through the foil is collected in a glass container placed underneath
  the foil, and two wires are placed in the glass container, a current will be
  able to flow through the acid when both of the wires are immersed in the
  acid.

     2) Sulfuric acid reacts very violently with potassium chlorate. If the
acid drips down into a container containing potassium chlorate, the potassium
chlorate will burst into flame.  This flame can be used to ignite a fuse, or
the potassium chlorate can be the igniter for a thermite bomb, if some
potassium chlorate is mixed in a 50/50 ratio with the thermite, and this
mixture is used as an igniter for the rest of the thermite.

     3) Sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permangenate in a similar way.


4.4     EXPLOSIVE CASINGS

     This section will cover everything from making a simple firecracker to a
complicated scheme for detonating an insensitive high explosive, both of which
are methods that could be utilized by perpetrators of terror.




4.41     PAPER CONTAINERS


     Paper was the first container ever used for explosives, since it was
first used by the Chinese to make fireworks. Paper containers are usually very
simple to make, and are certainly the cheapest. There are many possible uses
for paper in containing explosives, and the two most obvious are in
firecrackers and rocket engines. Simply by rolling up a long sheet of paper,
and gluing it together, one can make a simple rocket engine. Perhaps a more
interesting and dangerous use is in the firecracker. The firecracker shown
here is one of Mexican design. It is called a "polumna", meaning "dove". The
process of their manufacture is not unlike that of making a paper football. If
one takes a sheet of paper about 16 inches in length by 1.5 inches wide, and
fold one corner so that it looks like this:
       ________________________________________________
       |                                             |\
       |                                             | \
       |                                             |  \
       |_____________________________________________|___\

       and then fold it again so that it looks like this:

       ______________________________________________
       |                                           /|
       |                                          / |
       |                                         /  |
       |________________________________________/___|

      A pocket is formed.  This pocket can be filled with black powder,
pyrodex, flash powder, gunpowder,rocket engine powder, or any of the
quick-burning fuel- oxodizer mixtures that occur in the form of a fine powder.
    A fuse is then inserted, and one continues the triangular folds, being
careful not to spill out any of the explosive.  When the polumna is finished,
it should be taped together very tightly, since this will increase the
strength of the container, and produce a louder and more powerful explosion
when it is lit.  The finished polumna should look like a 1/4 inch - 1/3 inch
thick triangle, like the one shown below:


             ^

4.42     METAL CONTAINERS

     The classic pipe bomb is the best known example of a metal-contained
explosive.  Idiot anarchists take white tipped matches and cut off the match
heads.  They pound one end of a pipe closed with a hammer, pour in the white-
tipped matches, and then pound the other end closed.  This process often kills
the fool, since when he pounds the pipe closed, he could very easily cause
enough friction between the match heads to cause them to ignite and explode
the unfinished bomb.  By using pipe caps, the process is somewhat safer, and
the less stupid anarchist would never use white tipped matches in a bomb.
     He would buy two pipe caps and threaded pipe (fig. 1).  First, he would
drill a hole in one pipe cap, and put a fuse in it so that it will not come
out, and so powder will not escape during handling.  The fuse would be at
least 3/4 an inch long inside the bomb.  He would then screw the cap with the
fuse in it on tightly, possibly putting a drop of super glue on it to hold it
tight.  He would then pour his explosive powder in the bomb.  To pack it
tightly, he would take a large wad of tissue paper and, after filling the pipe
to the very top, pack the powder down, by using the paper as a ramrod tip, and
pushing it with a pencil or other wide ended object, until it would not move
any further.
    Finally, he would screw the other pipe cap on, and glue it. The tissue
paper would help prevent some of the powder from being caught in the threads
of the pipe or pipe cap from being crushed and subject to friction, which
might ignite the powder, causing an explosion during manufacture. An assembled
bomb is shown in fig. 2.

     This is one possible design that a mad bomber would use.  If, however, he
did not have access to threaded pipe with endcaps, he could always use a piece
of copper or aluminum pipe, since it is easily bent into a suitable position.  A
major problem with copper piping, however, is bending and folding it without
tearing it; if too much force is used when folding and bending copper pipe, it
will split along the fold.  The safest method for making a pipe bomb out of
copper or aluminum pipe is similar to the method with pipe and endcaps.
   First, one flattens one end of a copper or aluminum pipe carefully, making
sure not to tear or rip the piping.  Then, the flat end of the pipe should be
folded over at least once, if this does not rip the pipe.  A fuse hole should
be drilled in the pipe near the now closed end, and the fuse should be
inserted.

    Next, the bomb- builder would fill the bomb with a low order explosive,
and pack it with a large wad of tissue paper.  He would then flatten and fold
the other end of the pipe with a pair of pliers.  If he was not too dumb, he
would do this slowly, since the process of folding and bending metal gives off
heat, which could set off the explosive.  A diagram is presented below:

      A CO2 cartridge from a B.B gun is another excellent container for a low-
order explosive.  It has one minor disadvantage: it is time consuming to fill.
But this can be rectified by widening the opening of the cartridge with a
pointed tool.  Then, all that would have to be done is to fill the CO2
cartridge with any low-order explosive, or any of the fast burning
fuel-oxodizer mixtures, and insert a fuse.  These devices are commonly called
"crater makers".

Addendum 4/12/91:

    From personal experience, I have found that a CO2 cartridge is
    easiest to fill if you take a piece of paper and tape it around the
    opening to form a sort of funnel:

extinguish the flames.

*End Addendum

     A CO2 cartridge also works well as a container for a thermite incendiary
device, but it must be modified. The opening in the end must be widened, so
that the ignition mixture, such as powdered magnesium, does not explode. The
fuse will ignite the powdered magnesium, which, in turn, would ignite the
thermite .

 The previously mentioned designs for explosive devices are fine for low-
order explosives, but are unsuitable for high-order explosives, since the
latter requires a shockwave to be detonated. A design employing a smaller
low-order explosive device inside a larger device containing a high-order
explosive would probably be used.

     If the large high explosive container is small, such as a CO2 cartridge,
then a segment of a hollow radio antenna can be made into a low-order pipe bomb,
which can be fitted with a fuse, and inserted into the CO2 cartridge.

4.43     GLASS CONTAINERS

     Glass containers can be suitable for low-order explosives, but there are
problems with them.  First, a glass container can be broken relatively easily
compared to metal or plastic containers.  Secondly, in the not-too-unlikely
event of an "accident", the person making the device would probably be
seriously injured, even if the device was small.  A bomb made out of a sample
perfume bottle-sized container exploded in the hands of one boy, and he still
has pieces of glass in his hand.  He is also missing the final segment of his
ring finger, which was cut off by a sharp piece of flying glass...

     Nonetheless, glass containers such as perfume bottles can be used by a
demented individual, since such a device would not be detected by metal
detectors in an airport or other public place.  All that need be done is fill
the container, and drill a hole in the plastic cap that the fuse fits tightly
in, and screw the cap-fuse assembly on.

     Large explosive devices made from glass containers are not practicle,
since glass is not an exceptionally strong container.  Much of the explosive
that is used to fill the container is wasted if the container is much larger
than a 16 oz. soda bottle.  Also, glass containers are usually unsuitable for
high explosive devices, since a glass container would probably not withstand
the explosion of the initiator; it would shatter before the high explosive was
able to detonate.

4.44     PLASTIC CONTAINERS

     Plastic containers are perhaps the best containers for explosives, since
they can be any size or shape, and are not fragile like glass. Plastic piping
can be bought at hardware or plumbing stores, and a device much like the ones
used for metal containers can be made. The high-order version works well with
plastic piping. If the entire device is made out of plastic, it is not
detectable by metal detectors. Plastic containers can usually be shaped by
heating the container, and bending it at the appropriate place. They can be
glued closed with epoxy or other cement for plastics. Epoxy alone can be used
as an endcap, if a wad of tissue paper is placed in the piping. Epoxy with a
drying agent works best in this type of device.

     One end must be made first, and be allowed to dry completely before the
device can be filled with powder and fused.  Then, with another piece of
tissue paper, pack the powder tightly, and cover it with plenty of epoxy.  PVC
pipe works well for this type of device, but it cannot be used if the pipe had
an inside diameter greater than 3/4 of an inch.  Other plastic puttys can be
used in this type of device, but epoxy with a drying agent works best.

Addendum 4/12/91:

     In my experience, epoxy plugs work well, but epoxy is somewhat
expensive. One alternative is auto body filler, a grey paste which, when
mixed with hardener, forms into a rock-like mass which is stronger than
most epoxy. The only drawback is the body filler generates quite a bit
of heat as it hardens, which might be enough to set of a overly
sensitive explosive.
   One benefit of body filler is that it will hold it's shape quite
well, and is ideal for forming rocket nozzles and entire bomb casings.

4.5     ADVANCED USES FOR EXPLOSIVES

     The techniques presented here are those that could be used by a person
who had some degree of knowledge of the use of explosives.  Some of this
information comes from demolitions books, or from military handbooks.
Advanced uses for explosives usually involved shaped charges, or utilize a
minimum amount of explosive to do a maximum amount of damage.  They almost
always involve high- order explosives.

4.51     SHAPED CHARGES

     A shaped charge is an explosive device that, upon detonation, directs the
explosive force of detonation at a small target area. This process can be used
to breach the strongest armor, since forces of literally millions of pounds of
pressure per square inch can be generated. Shaped charges employ high-order
explosives, and usually electric ignition systems. KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL
EXPLOSIVES ARE DANGEROUS, AND SHOULD NEVER BE MADE OR USED!!

               An example of a shaped charge is shown below.

     If a device such as this is screwed to a safe, for example, it would
direct most of the explosive force at a point about 1 inch away from the
opening of the pipe. The basis for shaped charges is a cone-shaped opening in
the explosive material.  This cone should have an angle of 45 degrees.  A
device such as this one could also be attached to a metal surface with a
powerful electromagnet.


4.52     TUBE EXPLOSIVES

     A variation on shaped charges, tube explosives can be used in ways that
shaped charges cannot. If a piece of 1/2 inch plastic tubing was filled with a
sensitive high explosive like R.D.X., and prepared as the plastic explosive
container in section 4.44, a different sort of shaped charge could be
produced; a charge that directs explosive force in a circular manner. This
type of explosive could be wrapped around a column, or a doorknob, or a
telephone pole. The explosion would be directed in and out, and most likely
destroy whatever it was wrapped around. In an unbent state, a tube explosive
would look like this:

     When an assassin or terrorist wishes to use a tube bomb, he must wrap it
around whatever thing he wishes to destroy, and epoxy the ends of the tube bomb
together.  After it dries, he/she can connect wires to the squib wires, and
detonate the bomb, with any method of electric detonation.


4.53     ATOMIZED PARTICLE EXPLOSIONS

     If a highly flammable substance is atomized, or, divided into very small
particles, and large amounts of it is burned in a confined area, an explosion
similar to that occurring in the cylinder of an automobile is produced. The
tiny droplets of gasoline burn in the air, and the hot gasses expand rapidly,
pushing the cylinder up. Similarly, if a gallon of gasoline was atomized and
ignited in a building, it is very possible that the expanding gassed would
push the walls of the building down. This phenomenon is called an atomized
particle explosion.
    If a person can effectively atomize a large amount of a highly flammable
substance and ignite it, he could bring down a large building, bridge, or
other structure. Atomizing a large amount of gasoline, for example, can be
extremely difficult, unless one has the aid of a high explosive. If a gallon
jug of gasoline was placed directly over a high explosive charge, and the
charge was detonated, the gasoline would instantly be atomized and ignited. If
this occurred in a building, for example, an atomized particle explosion would
surely occur. Only a small amount of high explosive would be necessary to
accomplish this feat, about 1/2 a pound of T.N.T. or 1/4 a pound of R.D.X.
Also, instead of gasoline, powdered aluminum could be used. It is necessary
that a high explosive be used to atomize a flammable material, since a
low-order explosion does not occur quickly enough to atomize or ignite the
flammable material.


4.54     LIGHTBULB BOMBS

     An automatic reaction to walking into a dark room is to turn on the
light. This can be fatal, if a lightbulb bomb has been placed in the overhead
light socket.  A lightbulb bomb is surprisingly easy to make.  It also comes
with its own initiator and electric ignition system.  On some lightbulbs, the
lightbulb glass can be removed from the metal base by heating the base of a
lightbulb in a gas flame, such as that of a blowtorch or gas stove.  This must
be done carefully, since the inside of a lightbulb is a vacuum.  When the glue
gets hot enough, the glass bulb can be pulled off the metal base.  On other
bulbs, it is necessary to heat the glass directly with a blowtorch or
oxy-acetylene torch. In either case, once the bulb and/or base has cooled down
to room temperature or lower, the bulb can be filled with an explosive
material, such as black powder.  If the glass was removed from the metal base,
it must be glued back on to the base with epoxy.  If a hole was put in the
bulb, a piece of duct tape is sufficient to hold the explosive in the in the
bulb.  Then, after making sure that the socket has no power by checking with a
working lightbulb, all that need be done is to screw the lightbulb bomb into
the socket.  Such a device has been used by terrorists or assassins with much
success, since nobody can search the room for a bomb without first turning on
the light.


4.55     BOOK BOMBS

     Concealing a bomb can be extremely difficult in a day and age where
perpetrators of violence run wild.  Bags and briefcases are often searched by
authorities whenever one enters a place where an individual might intend to
set off a bomb.  One approach to disguising a bomb is to build what is called
a book bomb; an explosive device that is entirely contained inside of a book.
     Usually, a relatively large book is required, and the book must be of the
hardback variety to hide any protrusions of a bomb.  Dictionaries, law books,
large textbooks, and other such books work well.  When an individual makes a
bookbomb, he/she must choose a type of book that is appropriate for the place
where the book bomb will be placed.  The actual construction of a book bomb
can be done by anyone who possesses an electric drill and a coping saw.
  First, all of the pages of the book must be glued together.  By pouring an
entire container of water-soluble glue into a large bucket, and filling the
bucket with boiling water, a glue-water solution can be made that will hold
all of the book's pages together tightly.  After the glue-water solution has
cooled to a bearable temperature, and the solution has been stirred well, the
pages of the book must be immersed in the glue-water solution, and each page
must be thoroughly soaked.
   It is extremely important that the covers of the book do not get stuck to
the pages of the book while the pages are drying. Suspending the book by both
covers and clamping the pages together in a vice works best.  When the pages
dry, after about three days to a week, a hole must be drilled into the now
rigid pages, and they should drill out much like wood. Then, by inserting the
coping saw blade through the pages and sawing out a rectangle from the middle
of the book, the individual will be left with a shell of the book's pages.
The pages, when drilled out, should look like this:

               ________________________
               | ____________________ |
               | |                  | |

                 (book covers omitted)

     This rectangle must be securely glued to the back cover of the book.
After building his/her bomb, which usually is of the timer or radio controlled
variety, the bomber places it inside the book.  The bomb itself, and whatever
timer or detonator is used, should be packed in foam to prevent it from
rolling or shifting about.  Finally, after the timer is set, or the radio
control has been turned on, the front cover is glued closed, and the bomb is
taken to its destination.


4.56     PHONE BOMBS

     The phone bomb is an explosive device that has been used in the past to
kill or injure a specific individual.  The basic idea is simple: when the
person answers the phone, the bomb explodes.  If a small but powerful high
explosive device with a squib was placed in the phone receiver, when the
current flowed through the receiver, the squib would explode, detonating the
high explosive in the person's hand.  Nasty.  All that has to be done is
acquire a squib, and tape the receiver switch down.
 Unscrew the mouthpiece cover, and remove the speaker, and connect the squib's
leads where it was. Place a high explosive putty, such as C-1 (see section
3.31) in the receiver, and screw the cover on, making sure that the squib is
surrounded by the C-1. Hang the phone up, and leave the tape in place.
  When the individual to whom the phone belongs attempts to answer the phone,
he will notice the tape, and remove it.  This will allow current to flow
through the squib.  Note that the device will not explode by merely making a
phone call; the owner of the phone must lift up the receiver, and remove the
tape.  It is highly probable that the phone will be by his/her ear when the
device explodes...

Addendum 4/12/91:

    The above seems overly complicated to me... it would be better to rig
the device as follows:
  _________            FIRST UNPLUG THE PHONE FROM THE WALL
 /|-------|\  Wire the detonator IN LINE with the wires going to the earpiece,
 ~  |  |   ~  (may need to wire it with a relay so the detonator can receive
  @@@@@@@@    the full line power, not just to audio power to the earpiece)
 @@@@@@@@@@
 @@@@@@@@@@   Pack C4 into the phone body (NOT the handset) and plug it back
             in. When they pick up the phone, power will flow through the
             circuit to the detonator....


5.0     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS

     Explosive and/or poisoned ammunition is an important part of a social
deviant's arsenal.  Such ammunition gives the user a distinct advantage over
individual who use normal ammunition, since a grazing hit is good enough to
kill.  Special ammunition can be made for many types of weapons, from
crossbows to shotguns.


5.1     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR PRIMITIVE WEAPONS

     For the purposes of this publication, we will call any weapon primitive
that does not employ burning gunpowder to propel a projectile forward.  This
means blowguns, bows and crossbows, and wristrockets.

5.11     BOW AND CROSSBOW AMMUNITION

     Bows and crossbows both fire arrows or bolts as ammunition.  It is
extremely simple to poison an arrow or bolt, but it is a more difficult matter
to produce explosive arrows or bolts.  If, however, one can acquire aluminum
piping that is the same diameter of an arrow or crossbow bolt, the entire
segment of piping can be converted into an explosive device that detonates
upon impact, or with a fuse.
    All that need be done is find an aluminum tube of the right length and
diameter, and plug the back end with tissue paper and epoxy. Fill the tube
with any type of low-order explosive or sensitive high-order explosive up to
about 1/2 an inch from the top.
   Cut a slot in the piece of tubing, and carefully squeeze the top of the
tube into a round point, making sure to leave a small hole.  Place a no. 11
percussion cap over the hole, and secure it with super glue.
     Finally, wrap the end of the device with electrical or duct tape, and
make fins out of tape.  Or, fins can be bought at a sporting goods store, and
glued to the shaft.  The finished product should look like:

    ____________
___|____________\____________________
\                                   ---.
/__ ________________________________---`
   |____________/


     When the arrow or bolt strikes a hard surface, the percussion cap explodes,
igniting or detonating the explosive.


5.12     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BLOWGUNS

     The blowgun is an interesting weapon which has several advantages. A
blowgun can be extremely accurate, concealable, and deliver an explosive or
poisoned projectile.  The manufacture of an explosive dart or projectile is
not difficult.
  Perhaps the most simple design for such involves the use of a pill capsule,
such as the kind that are taken for headaches or allergies. Such a capsule
could easily be opened, and the medicine removed.  Next, the capsule would be
re-filled with an impact-sensitive explosive.  An additional high explosive
charge could be placed behind the impact-sensitive explosive, if one of the
larger capsules were used.
   Finally, the explosive capsule would be reglued back together, and a tassel
or cotton would be glued to the end containing the high explosive, to insure
that the impact-detonating explosive struck the target first.
 Such a device would probably be about 3/4 of an inch long, not including the
tassel or cotton, and look something like this:

5.13     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR WRISTROCKETS AND SLINGSHOTS

     A modern wristrocket is a formidable weapon.  It can throw a shooter marble
about 500 ft. with reasonable accuracy.  Inside of 200 ft., it could well be
lethal to a man or animal, if it struck in a vital area.  Because of the
relatively large sized projectile that can be used in a wristrocket, the
wristrocket can be adapted to throw relatively powerful explosive projectiles.

   A small segment of aluminum pipe could be made into an impact-detonating
device by filling it with an impact-sensitive explosive material.
   Also, such a pipe could be filled with a low-order explosive, and fitted
with a fuse, which would be lit before the device was shot.  One would have to
make sure that the fuse was of sufficient length to insure that the device did
not explode before it reached its intended target.
   Finally, .22 caliber caps, such as the kind that are used in .22 caliber
blank guns, make excellent exploding ammunition for wristrockets, but they
must be used at a relatively close range, because of their light weight.


5.2     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR FIREARMS


     When special ammunition is used in combination with the power and
rapidity of modern firearms, it becomes very easy to take on a small army with
a single weapon. It is possible to buy explosive ammunition, but that can be
difficult to do. Such ammunition can also be manufactured in the home.  There
is, however, a risk involved with modifying any ammunition.  If the ammunition
is modified incorrectly, in such a way that it makes the bullet even the
slightest bit wider, an explosion in the barrel of the weapon will occur.  For
this reason, NOBODY SHOULD EVER ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE SUCH AMMUNITION.


5.21     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR HANDGUNS

     If an individual wished to produce explosive ammunition for his/her
handgun, he/she could do it, provided that the person had an impact-sensitive
explosive and a few simple tools.  One would first purchase all lead bullets,
and then make or acquire an impact-detonating explosive.  By drilling a hole
in a lead bullet with a drill, a space could be created for the placement of
an explosive.  After filling the hole with an explosive, it would be sealed in
the bullet with a drop of hot wax from a candle.  A diagram of a completed
exploding bullet is shown below.

                      _o_ ------------ drop of wax

     This hollow space design also works for putting poison in bullets.


5.22     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR SHOTGUNS

     Because of their large bore and high power, it is possible to create some
extremely powerful special ammunition for use in shotguns. If a shotgun shell
is opened at the top, and the shot removed, the shell can be re-closed. Then,
if one can find a very smooth, lightweight wooden dowel that is close to the
bore width of the shotgun, a person can make several types of shotgun-launched
weapons.
   Insert the dowel in the barrel of the shotgun with the shell without the
shot in the firing chamber. Mark the dowel about six inches away from the end
of the barrel, and remove it from the barrel.
   Next, decide what type of explosive or incendiary device is to be used.
This device can be a chemical fire bottle (sect. 3.43), a pipe bomb (sect
4.42), or a thermite bomb (sect 3.41 and 4.42). After the device is made, it
must be securely attached to the dowel. When this is done, place the dowel
back in the shotgun. The bomb or incendiary device should be on the end of the
dowel.
   Make sure that the device has a long enough fuse, light the fuse, and fire
the shotgun. If the projectile is not too heavy, ranges of up to 300 ft are
possible. A diagram of a shotgun projectile is shown below:

5.3     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR COMPRESSED AIR/GAS WEAPONS

     This section deals with the manufacture of special ammunition for
compressed air or compressed gas weapons, such as pump B.B guns, CO2 B.B guns,
and .22 cal pellet guns.  These weapons, although usually thought of as kids
toys, can be made into rather dangerous weapons.


5.31     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR B.B GUNS

     A B.B gun, for this manuscript, will be considered any type of rifle or
pistol that uses compressed air or CO2 gas to fire a projectile with a caliber
of .177, either B.B, or lead pellet. Such guns can have almost as high a
muzzle velocity as a bullet-firing rifle. Because of the speed at which a .177
caliber projectile flies, an impact detonating projectile can easily be made
that has a caliber of .177.
     Most ammunition for guns of greater than .22 caliber use primers to
ignite the powder in the bullet. These primers can be bought at gun stores,
since many people like to reload their own bullets. Such primers detonate when
struck by the firing pin of a gun. They will also detonate if they are thrown
at a hard surface at a great speed.
 Usually, they will also fit in the barrel of a .177 caliber gun. If they are
inserted flat end first, they will detonate when the gun is fired at a hard
surface. If such a primer is attached to a piece of thin metal tubing, such as
that used in an antenna, the tube can be filled with an explosive, be sealed,
and fired from a B.B gun. A diagram of such a projectile appears below:

             _____ primers _______
            |                    |

                    |_______ antenna tubing

     The front primer is attached to the tubing with a drop of super glue. The
tubing is then filled with an explosive, and the rear primer is glued on.
Finally, a tassel, or a small piece of cotton is glued to the rear primer, to
insure that the projectile strikes on the front primer.  The entire projectile
should be about 3/4 of an inch long.



5.32     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR .22 CALIBER PELLET GUNS


     A .22 caliber pellet gun usually is equivalent to a .22 cal rifle, at
close ranges.  Because of this, relatively large explosive projectiles can be
adapted for use with .22 caliber air rifles.  A design similar to that used in
section 5.12 is suitable, since some capsules are about .22 caliber or
smaller. Or, a design similar to that in section 5.31 could be used, only one
would have to purchase black powder percussion caps, instead of ammunition
primers, since there are percussion caps that are about .22 caliber.  A #11
cap is too small, but anything larger will do nicely.


6.0     ROCKETS AND CANNONS

     Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery.
Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they are
difficult or impossible to acquire.  They are not, however, impossible to
make. Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex can make such
things. A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to
fear.


6.1     ROCKETS

     Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years before
the myth of christ began.  They were used for entertainment, in the form of
fireworks. They were not usually used for military purposes because they were
inaccurate, expensive, and unpredictable.  In modern times, however, rockets
are used constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have
no recoil. Perpetrators of violence, fortunately, cannot obtain military
rockets, but they can make or buy rocket engines.  Model rocketry is a popular
hobby of the space age, and to launch a rocket, an engine is required.  Estes,
a subsidiary of Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket
engines.  Their most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12
lbs. of thrust; enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a
significant distance. Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger
rocket engines, which develop up to 30 lbs. of thrust.  These model rocket
engines are quite reliable, and are designed to be fired electrically.  Most
model rocket engines have three basic sections.  The diagram below will help
explain them.

     The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted.  When the area labeled
"thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a
propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of
hot, rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing the rocket
forward.
     After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is
ignited.  It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder that
has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black,
white, or yellow in color.  This section exists so that the rocket will be
seen when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.
     When it is burned up, it ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject".
The ejection charge is finely powdered black powder.  It burns very rapidly,
exploding, in effect.  The explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the
parachute of the model rocket. It could also be used to ignite the fuse of a
bomb...

     Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system.  Typical engine
labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5.  The letter is an
indicator of the power of an engine.  "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A"
engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" engines, and so on.  The
number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in
pounds. the final number and letter is the time delay, from the time that the
thrust period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T"
indicates a 3 second delay.

NOTE: an extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum
  dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of iron oxide. The
  mixture is bound together by an epoxy.


6.11     BASIC ROCKET BOMB

     A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered
to its target by means of a rocket.  Most people who would make such a device
would use a model rocket engine to power the device.  By cutting fins from
balsa wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such as the Estes "C"
engine, a basic rocket could be constructed.  Then, by attaching a "crater
maker", or CO2 cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb would be added.  To insure
that the fuse of the "crater maker" (see sect. 4.42) ignited, the clay over
the ejection charge of the engine should be scraped off with a plastic tool.
The fuse of the bomb should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.

     Duct tape is the best way to attach the crater maker to the rocket
engine. Note in the diagram the absence of the clay over the ejection charge
Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such
as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire bottle.

   Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that
the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

           \_____/


     The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so
that they are rounded.  This will help make the rocket fly straight.  A two
inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch
it from.  A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch rod.  The segment
of a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the
fins of the rocket.  A front view of a completed rocket bomb is shown below.

     By cutting a coat hanger at the indicated arrows, and bending it, a
launch rod can be made.  After a fuse is inserted in the engine, the rocket is
simply slid down the launch rod, which is put through the segment of plastic
straw. The rocket should slide easily along a coathanger, such as the one
illustated on the following page:

6.12     LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB

     Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets.  Model
rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in
multi-stage rockets.  An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of
such an engine. Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection
charge explodes.  If another engine is placed directly against the back of an
"0" engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot gasses and
burning particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the
thrust section.  This will push the used "0" engine off of the rocket, causing
an overall loss of weight.

 The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as
travels, and it gains velocity.  A multi-stage rocket must be designed
somewhat differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rocket
to fly straight, its center of gravity must be ahead of its center of drag.
This is accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving
the center of drag back by putting fins on the rocket that are well behind the
rocket.  A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

     The fuse is put in the bottom engine.

     Two, three, or even four stages can be added to a rocket bomb to give it
a longer range.  It is important, however, that for each additional stage, the
fin area gets larger.


6.13     MULTIPLE WARHEAD ROCKET BOMBS

     "M.R.V." is an acronym for Multiple Reentry Vehicle.  The concept is
simple: put more than one explosive warhead on a single missile.  This can be
done without too much difficulty by anyone who knows how to make crater-makers
and can buy rocket engines.  By attaching crater makers with long fuses to a
rocket, it is possible that a single rocket could deliver several explosive
devices to a target. Such a rocket might look like the diagram on the
following page:

              ___

6.2     CANNON

     The cannon is a piece of artillery that has been in use since the 11th
century.  It is not unlike a musket, in that it is filled with powder, loaded,
and fired.  Cannons of this sort must also be cleaned after each shot,
otherwise, the projectile may jam in the barrel when it is fired, causing the
barrel to explode.  A sociopath could build a cannon without too much trouble,
if he/she had a little bit of money, and some patience.


6.21     BASIC PIPE CANNON


     A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone.  The only
difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior.
This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam.  Copper or
aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be extremely thick
to withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.


  If one uses a projectile such as a CO2 cartridge, since such a projectile
can be made to explode, a pipe that is about 1.5 - 2 feet long is ideal.  Such
a pipe MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 an inch thick, and be very
smooth on the interior.  If possible, screw an endplug into the pipe.
Otherwise, the pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or
tearing the pipe. A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe near the
crimp or endplug. Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two
teaspoons of grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, pack it lightly by
ramming a wad of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a CO2 cartridge.
Brace the cannon securely against a strong structure, light the fuse, and run.
If the person is lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will
not be hit by pieces of exploding barrel.  Such a cannon would look like this:

             __________________ fuse hole
             |
             |
             V
      ________________________________________________________________
      |_______________________________________________________________|
      |endplug|powder|t.p.| CO2 cartridge
      | ______|______|____|____________________________________________
      |_|______________________________________________________________|

     An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a CO2
cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and
construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the
cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, except
for a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a
tissue paper packing wad.
                                         ___
 When the cannon is fired, it           (   )
will ignite the end of the              |C  |
fuse, and shoot the CO2                 |  M|
cartridge. The                          |   |
explosive-filled cartridge              |   |
will explode in about three             \  /
seconds, if all goes well.               [] <--- taped fuse
Such a projectile would look             []
like this:                               []

6.22     ROCKET FIRING CANNON

           ___          A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a
          /   \    normal cannon; the only difference is the ammunition. A
          |   |    rocket fired from a cannon will fly further than a rocket
          | C |    alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the
          | M |    initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is
          |   |    moving will go further than one that is launched when it
          |   |    is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble a normal
          |___|    rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It would look
          | E |    like the image to the left.
          | N |
          | G |         the fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short,
          | I |    but it would not be ignited until the rocket's ejection
          | N |    charge exploded.  Thus, the delay before the ejection
          | E |    charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb
          |___|    explodes. Note that no fuse need be put in the rocket; the
                   burning powder in the cannon will ignite it, and
                   simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high
                   velocity.


7.0     PYROTECHNICA ERRATA

     There are many other types of pyrotechnics that a perpetrator of violence
might employ. Smoke bombs can be purchased in magic stores, and large military
smoke bombs can be bought through ads in gun and military magazines. Also,
fireworks can also be used as weapons of terror. A large aerial display rocket
would cause many injuries if it were to be fired so that it landed on the
ground near a crowd of people. Even the "harmless" pull-string fireworks,
which consists of a sort of firecracker that explodes when the strings running
through it are pulled, could be placed inside a large charge of a sensitive
high explosive. Tear gas is another material that might well be useful to the
sociopath, and such a material could be instantly disseminated over a large
crowd by means of a rocket-bomb, with nasty effects.


7.1     SMOKE BOMBS

     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb.  Such a device could conceal the getaway
route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover.  Such a device, were it
to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation of
a building, for example.  Smoke bombs are not difficult to make.  Although the
military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium compounds,
such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped
terrorist. Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such as
black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion.  The base material will burn
well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to burn, but
not completely or cleanly.  Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a base material,
produces large amounts of smoke.  Sawdust, especially if it has a small amount
of oil in it, and a base powder works well also.  Other excellent smoke
ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground plastics, and many
chemical mixtures.  The material in road flares can be mixed with sugar and
sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke.  Most of the fuel-oxodizer
mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke when added to a base
powder.  The list of possibilities goes on and on.  The trick to a successful
smoke bomb also lies in the container used.  A plastic cylinder works well, and
contributes to the smoke produced.  The hole in the smoke bomb where the fuse
enters must be large enough to allow the material to burn without causing an
explosion.  This is another plus for plastic containers, since they will melt
and burn when the smoke material ignites, producing an opening large enough to
prevent an explosion.

7.2     COLORED FLAMES

     Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists. by
putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when the
ejection charge fires, will send out a burning colored ball.  The materials that
produce the different colors of flames appear below.

COLOR               MATERIAL                        USED IN

red                 strontium                      road flares,                  
                    salts                          red sparklers

green               barium salts                   green sparklers               
                   (barium nitrate)

yellow              sodium salts                   gold sparklers

                                                   treating sewage

7.3     TEAR GAS

     A terrorist who could make tear gas or some similar compound could use it
with ease against a large number of people.  Tear gas is fairly complicated to
make, however, and this prevents such individuals from being able to utilize
its great potential for harm.  One method for its preparation is shown below.



     EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING TEAR GAS
     _________

     1.  ring stands (2)             7.  clamp holder
     2.  alcohol burner              8.  condenser
     3.  erlenmeyer flask, 300 ml    9.  rubber tubing
     4.  clamps (2)                  10.  collecting flask
     5.  rubber stopper              11.  air trap
     6.  glass tubing                12.  beaker, 300 ml

     MATERIALS
     _________

     10 gms  glycerine   2 gms sodium bisulfate    distilled water

1.)  In an open area, wearing a gas mask, mix 10 gms of glycerine with 2 gms
of sodium bisulfate in the 300 ml erlenmeyer flask.

2.)  Light the alcohol burner, and gently heat the flask.

3.)  The mixture will begin to bubble and froth; these bubbles are tear gas.

4.)  When the mixture being heated ceases to froth and generate gas, or a
   brown residue becomes visible in the tube, the reaction is complete.
   Remove the heat source, and dispose of the heated mixture, as it is
   corrosive.

5.)  The material that condenses in the condenser and drips into the collecting  
   flask is tear gas.  It must be capped tightly, and stored in a safe place.


7.4     FIREWORKS

     While fireworks cannot really be used as an effective means of terror,
they do have some value as distractions or incendiaries.  There are several
basic types of fireworks that can be made in the home, whether for fun,
profit, or nasty uses.

7.41     FIRECRACKERS

     A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy. The
instructions are below:

     1) Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using.
 "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.

     2) Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill it
with epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter  of the
tubing.  Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as specified on the
package.

     3) When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and        
insert a desired length of fuse.

     4) Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive.  Flash
powder, pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide, nitrocellulose,
or any of the fast burning fuel-oxodizer mixtures will do nicely.  Fill the
tube almost to the top.

     5) Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper and
a pencil or other suitable ramrod.  Be sure to leave enough space for more
epoxy.

     6) Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow    
     it to dry.

     7) For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use flash
powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for colors. By crushing
the material on a sparkler, and adding it to the flash powder, the explosion
will be the same color as the sparkler.   By adding small chunks of sparkler
material, the device will throw out colored burning sparks, of the same color
as the sparkler.  By adding powdered iron, orange sparks will be produced.
White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings, or from small, LIGHTLY
crumpled balls of aluminum foil.

        Example:  Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode         
      with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.

        First, I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material
inside it.   Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely powder it.
    Then, I would mix a small amount of this material with the flash powder.
(NOTE: FLASH POWDER MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT IS MIXED WITH, AND
EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY!)  I would mix it in a ratio of 9 parts flash powder to
1 part of flare or sparkler material, and add about 15 small balls of aluminum
foil I would store the material in a plastic bag overnight outside of the
house, to make sure that the stuff doesn't react. Then, in the morning, I
would test a small amount of it, and if it was satisfactory, I would put it in
the firecracker.

     8) If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine,        
professional to semi-professional displays can be produced.


7.42     SKYROCKETS

     An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from
model rocket engines.  Estes engines are recommended.

     1) Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering that
the power doubles with each letter.  (See sect. 6.1 for details)

     2) Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly fits
the engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper and glue.

     3) Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that the
powder is exposed.  Glue the tube to the engine, so that the tube covers at
least half the engine.  Pour a small charge of flash powder in the tube, about
1/2 an inch.

     4) By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers,        
various types of effects can be produced.

     5) By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick
in the tube, spectacular displays with moving fireballs or M.R.V.'s can be
produced.

     6) Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with        
the fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.


7.43     ROMAN CANDLES

     Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult to
make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are well
worth the trouble.

     1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with
several layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must be done to prevent the
tube from exploding.  Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.

     2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy        
and the drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.

     3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and
      insert a desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that the fuse
      fits tightly.

     4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the       
 tube.

     5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired
 color.  Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small
 amount of pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material
 / 20% flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After mixing the powders well, add water,
 one drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.
      This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when
left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube. Allow
the ball to dry.

     6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down       
 fairly easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack         
it gently against the ball with a pencil.

     7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in
 a safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works, a colored
 fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet.  This
 height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in step 4,
 or by using a slightly longer tube.

     8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.

     9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,     
   producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

9.0     CHECKLIST FOR RAIDS ON LABS

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

10.0     USEFUL PYROCHEMISTRY

     In general, it is possible to make many chemicals from just a few basic
ones.  A list of useful chemical reactions is presented.  It assumes knowledge
of general chemistry; any individual who does not understand the following

     The Al will be a very fine silvery powder at the bottom of the container
which must be filtered and dried. This same method works with nitric and
sulfuric acids, but these acids are too valuable in the production of high
explosives to use for such a purpose, unless they are available in great
excess.

11.0     ABOUT THE AUTHOR

     The author, who wishes his name to be unknown, is presently attending a
college in the United States of America, majoring in Engineering.  He was
raised by his parents on the East Coast, and received his high school
education there. He first became interested in pyrotechnics when he was about
eight years of age. At age twelve, he produced his first explosive device; it
was slightly more powerful than a large firecracker.  He continued to produce
explosive devices for several years.  He also became interested in model
rocketry, and has built several rockets from kits, and designed his own
rockets.
  While in high school, the author became affiliated with CHAOS, and
eventually became the head of Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies.  At this time, at
age 18, he produced his first high explosive device, putting a 1 foot deep
crater in an associate's back yard. He had also produced many types of
rockets, explosive ammunition, and other pyrotechnic devices.
  While he was heading Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies, he was injured when a
home made device exploded in his hand; he did not make the device.  The author
learned, however, and  then decided to reform, and although he still
constructs an occasional explosive device, he chooses to abstain from their
production.
  An occasional rocket that produces effects similar to that of professional
displays can sometimes be seen in the midnight sky near his college, and the
Fourth of July is still his favorite day of the year.

PART 2 - Tennis ball cannons 
------   Information from the Usenet.  The Usenet is a worldwide network of      
         15,000 machines and over 500,000 people- And growing!

         Addendum by David Richards:
         The POINT BBS at (312) 338-0632 offers free access to several usenet
         message areas.

         Addendum by The Editor:   If you aren't in the Chicago area,
         check a local BBS list.  If you see a BBS which runs under UNIX,
         odds are it carries usenet.  The appropriate place to look is 
         rec.pyrotechnics.


At this time (twelve years ago) most soft drink cans were rolled tin rather
than the molded aluminum.  We would cut the tops and bottoms off of a  bunch
of them and tape them together with duct tape, forming a tube  of two feet or
more.
        At the end we would tape a can with the bottom  intact, more holes
punched (with a can opener) around the top, and a  small hole in the side at
the base. We then fastened this contraption to a tripod so we could aim it
reliably. Any object that came somewhat close to filling the tube was then
placed therein.

        In the shop, we used the clock as a target and an empty plastic
solder spool as ammunition, with tape over the ends of the center hole and
sometimes filled with washers for weight.  When taken to parties or picnics,
we would use whatever was handy.  Hot dog rolls or napkins filled with  potato
chips provided spectacular entertainment.
 
        Once loaded, a small amount of lighter fluid was poured into the hole
in  the side of the end can and allowed to vaporize for a few moments.  The
"fire control technician" would announce "Fire in the Hole" and ignite  it.
 
BOOM!  Whoosh!  The clock never worked after that! 
---------- 
    Our version of the potatoe chip cannon, was built similarly.  Ours used
coke cans, six with the top and bottom removed, and the  seventh had church
key holes all around one end.  This was spiral  wrapped with at least two
rolls of duct tape.
     A wooden shoulder rest  and forward hand grip was taped to the tube.  For
ignition we used  lantern batteries to a model-t coil, actuated by a push
button on  the hand grip.  A fresh wilson tennis ball was stuffed all the way
back to the grid, and a drop or two of lighter fluid was dropped in  one of
two holes in the end.  The ignition wire was poked through  the other hole.
 
    We would then lie in ambush, waiting for somthing to move.  When fired
with the proper air/fuel mixture, a satisfying thoomp!  At maximum range  the
ball would travel about 100 yards with a 45 degree launch angle.  Closer up
the ball would leave a welt on an warring opponent.  When  launched at a
moving car the thud as it hit the door would generally  rattle anyone inside.
Luckily we never completed the one that shot golf balls.

from _FM 10-0: TRICKS, AWFUL_  (includes material from rec.humor):

DRY ICE

Time Bombs:

1.  Get a small plastic container with lid (we used the small plastic  cans
that hold the coaters used for large-format Polaroid film). A  film canister
would probably work; the key is, it should seal tightly  and take a fair
amount of effort to open).

Place a chunk of dry ice in the can, put on the lid without quite  sealing it.
Put the assembled bomb in your pocket, or behind your  back.

Approach the mark and engage in normal conversation. When his  attention is
drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it  somewhere within a
few feet of the mark, out of obvious sight, then  leave.

Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment first), you'll hear  a loud
"pop" and an even louder "Aarrggghhh!" within a minute, when  the CO2 pressure
becomes sufficient to blow off the lid.

In a cluttered lab, this is doubly nasty because the mark will  proabably
never figure out what made the noise.

2.  Put 2-3 inches of water in a 2-liter plastic pop bottle.  Put in  as many
chunks of dry ice as possible before the smoke gets too thick.  Screw on the
cap, place in an appropriate area, and run like hell.  After about a minute
(your mileage may vary), a huge explosion will  result, spraying water
everywhere, along with what's left of the 2-liter bottle.

More things to do with Dry Ice:
     "I put it in my teacher's coffee. (Holy sh-t, the place is on fire!)"
"Throw it in toilets.  (Creature from the Brown Lagoon)"
      "Make soda from ordinary juice, etc."
   "Blow up balloons and condoms with it  (Put a chunk in a balloon, tie  up
the end.)"

     "Fun stuff. It SCREAMS when it comes into contact with metal..." "You can
safely hold a small piece of dry ice in your mouth if you  KEEP IT MOVING
CONSTANTLY. It looks like you're smoking or on fire." Fluorescein (the stuff
in navy-surplus sea dye markers) is  effective in swimming pools.  Or try a
"Baby Ruth" candy bar...


PART 4
                    More Fun Stuff for Terrorists

                             Carbide Bomb

This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some calcium
carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and can be found at
nearly any hardware store.
    Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a
glass jar with some water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with
the water to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in
cutting torches.
    Eventually the glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a
burning rag nearby, you will get a nice fireball!

                      Portable Grenade Launcher

If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an aluminum
arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade FFFF, it burns
easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole left where the ferrule
went. Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you are ready to go! Make sure no one
is nearby.... Little shreds of aluminim go all over the place!!

                      Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower

For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a switch.
Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipeby
drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily. Attach the wire (this is
regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch and to the spark plug. The
other side of the switch is attached to the positive terminal on the battery.
With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be
careful that no one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20
feet!!!

PART 5- This is all various files I gleaned from BBS's.  (Added 8-23-90)
  
       This works best if you happen to have a lot of derelict  friends, as I
do... Your first day of school you should bring  the following items, to
insure a prosperous school year:
 
   1) Fountain pen (and extra ink refills) 
   2) 3 tubes of Super Glue (Krazy Glue) 
   3) Pennies (about $1.00 worth) 
   4) Balloons (small sized for convenience) 
   5) Mirror (small hand held) 
   6) Liquid soap 
   7) Lighter, (matches as alternate) 
   8) Firecrackers (ladyfingers are great) 
   9) Screwdrivers and other tools (small) 
  10) Small squeezable bottles (like nasal de-congestant type)
  11) Wire (10-20 ft)
  12) Tape recorder mic. (batter operated pref.) 
  13) Ziplock baggies 
  14) Half of an orange 
  15) Light bulb (75 watts and over are great) 
 
       This will do for now... Some of the cool things to do are, take the
pennies and glue them to the cafeteria tables, (and watch the custodians  try
to get 'em off). (this also looks good with silver dollars glued to the  fire
alarm (so it goes off when the custodian attempts to remove the coin)  and to
a door someplace... (principals preferably)

       Another thing to do with a coin is, heat it up over a bunsen burner (in
chem) and just as the bell rings, toss the coin into the hall, I will
guarantee you will know when the coin is picked up... While you're using the
bunsen burner, fill your little squeeze bottle with gas, then cap it tight and
put it in your pocket... later, take a firecracker, and glue it  to the
bottle, use a cigarette as a fuse extension, then put it in the  bathroom, and
get to class fast... (gas and glue make a nice flame)...
          While you're in the bathroom, place a light bulb over the door,  and
when the superintendent goes to see what the explosion was, he gets a  nice
little surprise...
       Now for the wire, if you can access a room near your locker, when no
one is in the room, take off the speaker cover on the PA system, and hook 2
wires from it, to your mic. ( then into your locker) This is good for get-ting
your friends out of classes... Just ask for them... (use your tools for that
one, and try to be neat about it)...
 
        Now for your mirror, you can use this for getting your, uh...
"Friend's" locker combination... after you get that, take that little baggie
you got, and put the orange in it... let it sit for a week or four, then open
the baggie, and place it in your friends locker... I can guarantee he/ she
will love it...

        Another thing that is fun to do, is, Take a penny, and glue it over
the key hole on your friends gym locker, just after he goes  out, thus he  has
to truck around all day in his gym stuff, (unless  you rent him your
screwdriver to pry the penny off)
 
        Balloons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the gas
that you get out of the taps on the lab desks, then tie up the  balloon
tight, and drop it out the window to the burnouts below, you  know, the ones
that are always smoking, they love to pop balloons with lit cigarette.... get
the picture? Good...
 
        Those fountain pens are cool, because if you make a slight jerking
motion with your hand, ink squirts all over the room, (or person, whatever
you're aiming at) It is a good idea not to let the teachers know you have  one
of those, it makes it too easy to find out who did it when there's ink  all
over the principals face... (or on the floors, walls, and ceilings...)
   
        Liquid soap is great for use in crowded hallways, it turns every-body
into a ice skating star, (works especially well when people come in  from the
rain)... If your school is anything like the one I go to, people  never flush
the toilets, A little liquid soap in here makes for a nice  surprise, I mean,
what happens when the soap is not flushed out of the  toilet, and the suds
aren't flushed out either? The janitors have a  really good time trying to
figure out that one... (glue a quarter in one of the urinals, always fun)...
Turn off the water under the sinks too. Getting back to the soap, it is also
good on the hand railings in hall-ways and on steps, If you mix perfume with
it, some poor grub has to have  that stench on him all day.

- The Dark Side (312) - 787 - 2174 / Exilic Xyth - Sysop / 24 hours 9600
       The Modern Speeders Guide to Radar and State Troopers
        By : Exilic Xyth                     January 11, 1988

         Introduction:

      Touched off by the discussion on Ripco <312>-528-5020, I found many
users asking questions about police radar, radar detectors, and speeding. With
Ron Majors talking about the oil spill that will appear in detail on the news
at ten I thought a informative file on the subject might  be beneficial. I
myself had my first experience with police radar in my  fathers car, then
following in baseball and my own driving, much more on the  subject.  What a
fascinating device, that it will return your speed instantly,  what fun one
would be to have!  After a quick talk with a police friend of  mine, I soon
took possession of a used police radar gun.

         Part one: Operation.

   Police Radar works via the doppler effect, best demonstrated by sound
rather than microwaves.  The doppler effect is the  relation of speed to the
pitch of 'sound'.  Sometime, all of you must have had the distinct pleasure of
being honked at by a motorist on the go,  you might have noticed that the horn
<an F flat on most american cars>  begins with a higher pitch and as the car
passes, drowns off to a lower tone.  The sound waves at the front of the car
are pressed together by the  forward motion of the car, creating a higher
pitch.  As the car passes, the tone dies off to a lower pitch because the
waves are spread out.

 Police radar works in much the same way.  The major differences are the
frequency and the concentration of the carrier.  As of 1988, the F.C.C.  is
rumored to have lifted restrictions on police radar frequencies.  Before, only
two frequencies were approved for police radar use.  X-band <10.525 GHz> which
is most commonly used, and K-band <24.15 Ghz>.  I will assume for now, due to
lack of any SOLID evidence supporting the restriction lift, that those are the
only two in operation.  Police radar 'beams' are similar in shape to a
flashlight beam.  They begin with a thin width and cone outwards with
distance.  Most guns operating at the X-band level have a range of about 2000
ft., although high power units can exceed 2500 and 3000ft., and K-band guns
fall shorter at about 1200 ft..  At 1500ft., the radar beam becomes about the
width of four highway lanes, so for practical purposes radars range is around
1700 ft..

 A radar signal transmitted from the 'Radar Gun's' transmitter, (called the
oscillator) will bounce off a object and return to the radar receiver (or
antenna).  If the object is moving, the frequency of the beam will be altered
as it bounces.  This is most easily visualized watching water ripples.  Assume
now that I have just dropped a pebble in a pond, and the ripples are moving
outward, assume also for purposes of simplicity that the ripples are moving at
1 foot per second, and that they are one foot apart.  The ripples are
therefore also one second apart.  Upon bouncing off a stationary object the
ripples will return weakened, but at the same interval and speed <Not really
the same speed, but let's not complicate things>.

 Now let us assume that a toy boat is traveling in the water at .5 ft.  per
second, 1/2 the speed of the ripples, away from the point which I dropped the
pebble.  Assume the first ripple has hit the boat and is traveling back.  The
second ripple now traveling at 1 foot per second is only gaining on the boat
by .5 feet per second <1 ft.  per second - .5 ft.  per second>.  This means
that the ripple is one foot away from the boat, as the ripples are one foot
apart. The ripple will take 2 second to reach the boat, as the closure speed
is .5 ft.  per second and the distance is 1 foot.  The ripple strikes the boat
and bounces back two seconds after the first ripple.  The process works
inversely for an object moving towards the pebbles point of impact.

 As the distance between the ripples can be determined by the speed, on the
other side, the speed can be determined by the distance between the ripples.
Police radar works in the same way with microwaves.  The microwave signal
bounces off a moving vehicle and returns altered in frequency.  In this way
the radar unit determines the speed of the object.

 Radar is only accurate when the object is moving directly at, or directly
away from the gun, although some modern guns will account for this 'COSINE
error', most won't.  Cosine error can be defined as this: When a radar signal
bounces off an object at an angle from the objects direction of travel it will
return a portion of the objects speed computed by the cosine of the infraction
angle.  If the angle of the objects direction and the radars direction is 20
degrees the speed returned by the radar is 93.97% of the objects actual speed.
cos (20) = .93969262 * objects speed = returned speed.

 For example: A car is traveling at 75 m.p.h..  The state trooper, in his
infinite wisdom, decides to "Clock" the automobile in hopes of meeting his
quota for the month.  Picking up his handy radar gun, he aims, and fires an
invisible beam of microwave energy.  The officer however, being the rookie he
is, leaves a high angle between the cars direction and his beam of 45 degrees.
Cos (45) = .707106781 .707106781 * 75m.p.h.  = 53.03300859 53 m.p.h. is
displayed on the officers screen.  Lucky motorist.  Sorry 40 column users.

   Part 2: Application

     In 1986, over 15 million speeding tickets were issued, and experts
estimate that over 25% of them were in error.  Police have been using radar
for speed control for many years, and as the technology has become more
complex and accurate, so has the ability to get away with the slight
infractions of the speed limits set by the government become more difficult.
In recent years, the three most damaging advances to motorists in radar
technology include:

     A> Instant on radar.
     B> K-band radar.
 and C> Cosine error correcting radar units.

     Instant on radar.
        With the increase of radar receivers, or "Detectors" on the roads,
police have attempted to bypass the motorists first line of defense.  The most
damaging advance in the war against speeding motorists is instant on radar.
The idea behind instant on radar is to make the radar detector useless to the
motorist by making his warning too late to react to.  Instant on radar was
developed in early 1983, but never marketed until late 1984 when the michigan
state troopers were equipped with the first instant on radar guns.  It
operates by deactivating the oscillator until triggered by the officer.  When
used properly and under the right traffic conditions, it is indefensible.  It
works like a camera, the officer operating the radar will position himself
behind a blind corner or over a hill.  When the approaching car crests the
hill or rounds the corner, the officer will activate the oscillator, taking a
"snapshot" of your car.  As microwaves travel at the speed of light, any
attempt at slowing down is futile, the officer behind the gun has your speed
in less than a tenth of a second.

     K-band Radar.
        When radar detectors were first marketed by the markers of ESCORT,
there was only one type of radar.  X-band.  In an attempt to increase the
dwindling speeding ticket revenue, K-band was brought to life.  K- band is a
different frequency that could not be picked up by the primitive detectors of
the age.  However, as the frequency got out, the detectors adapted, and now
any detector worth a dollar will detect both X and K bands.  K band is more
dangerous as most K-band guns are instant on and they have less 'Splash' and
range than X-band guns.  This means that a K-band signal is probably closer to
you.

     Cosine error correcting guns.

        Cosine error was a major falling of radar in the judicial system, all
readings were under question in court, the result was a gun which will correct
for cosine error by determining the angle which the radar beam "impacts" with
the car.  Also new in correcting cosine error were guns with 'Speed lock on'
in which the highest speed reading received by the gun is locked in and
displayed.

     Moving radar guns.

        Until new developments, all radar units had to remain stationary as
radar measures only closure speed, and not actual speed. Moving radar ended
this trend.  Moving radar works like this.  First the radar gun determines the
patrol cars speed by clocking a sign or fixed object.  The closing speed of
the patrol car to the sign is subtracted from the now taken closing speed to
the target car.

        Patrols speed - 60 m.p.h.
        Closing speed to car - 120 m.p.h.
   120 m.p.h.  - 60 m.p.h.  = 60 m.p.h..


   Part 3: Defense
     From the dawn of speed enforcement, motorists have sought to defeat the
laws, starting with detectors, continuing to jammers and topping out with the
new 'CHiPs detectors' The unfortunate conditions now favor the police and law
enforcement officials with the introduction of new radar technologies such as
instant on radar.

     Detectors:

       The simple radar receiver is the first line of defense
from radar.  Varied in operation and features, the radar detectors of today are
designed to provide high sensitivity and low rates of false alarms.  Good
detectors will measure signal strength and type <K or X> and have an effective
range of about 3000 ft.  and a probable range of well over a mile.  Sensitivity
tops out around 110.5 dBm/cm^2 for X band and 108 dBm/cm^2 for K band <Both set
by the passport>.  A detector can give you an excellent advantage over radar by
alerting you it's there.  Detectors become especially useful in chicago where
instant on radar is not typically used.

     Jammers:
        Radar jammers are essentially units that transmit microwaves at a
frequency dictating a certain speed.  The result is regardless of your speed,
the police radar unit will display the speed you set the jammer to transmit.
Jammers are highly illegal and will be confiscated if discovered, expect a
stiff fine.

     Chip's detector.

        This is a new device, which is really a scanner on the police radio
band.  It takes advantage of a signal transmitted by the patrol cars in some
states as part of their dispatch system.  The signal carries for about three
miles, and the Chip's Detector will alert you if you are within that range of
a highway patrol unit.  It also allows scanning of police radio channels.

   Last words.

     Radar is a basically accurate instrument, when used properly, it can be
deadly.  As I have said before instant on radar is impossible to avoid when
there is no other traffic around, regardless of a detector.  The only thing
that comes close is a Radar Jammer, which will most likely not serve you well
unless it is WELL hidden.  Radar jammers are dangerous with the introduction
of the HAWK, a radar unit by Kustom Signals, which DETECTS radar jammers in
the hold mode.

     Aside from radar, VASCAR <Visual average speed computer and recorder> is
     a new danger to motorists.  It is basically a stopwatch used to time your
     movement between two point of which the interval distance is known.
     Using the formula Average velocity = distance / time, the state trooper
     can determine your speed without setting off your detector.

          Instant on radar defense.

        The only real defense for instant on radar is traffic.  Traffic will
cause the trooper to activate his radar gun more often, cluing you into his
presence.  A jammer well hidden will help, but the best technique is to follow
a car making good time.  Any police units in the area will clock him first,
and legally they have to ticket him, unless you're too close.

Remember: 
 Do not speed, it is a dangerous practice, and I can not be responsible for
any injury, or action due to this file, it is for informational  purposes
only.  The state troopers enforce speed limits for your  safety.

     Radar guns: Models.

        Radar guns are manufactured by many different companies, but the
primary ones are Kustom Signals, M.p.h.  Industries, and Decatur. The
deadliest gun now available is the HAWK manufactured by Kustom Signals.  It is
the first gun capable of clocking cars moving the SAME direction as the patrol
car.  It has two antennas, one forward, and one back.  Like I stated before,
it is also the first gun capable of detecting radar jammers.  These run about
$~2000

        Kr-11
        This gun is a two piece model which uses a weak pulse signal in the
moving mode to determine the patrol car's speed while not triggering
detectors.  This gun permits a faster clocking time for instant on moving
radar, it runs about $~1200

        Falcon
        This is a hand held gun operating on K band Small and compact it is
preferred among law enforcement radars.  It runs about 600$

        Hr-4 Hr-8 Hr-12
        400,500,750$ respectively, these are hand held radar guns made by
Kustom Signals

        All these units are available to you via me for less than the troopers
pay for them.  For prices, and statistics, call my board at (312) - 787 - 2174
or send me mail at Ripco (312) 528-5020

        Prices for radar units range from 250-2000$
     I personally enjoy harassing that 911 who barrels by at 95 with a
  detector.

   Picking combo locks:

    Ok, so ya say ya wanna learn how to pick combination locks...This text
file should help you.  As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help
you.
    First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on
the horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
     To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired
combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the
lock open.  I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock
without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this also helps
when ya don't know the combination to begin with).
      First of all, ya need to find a hairpin.  What's a hairpin? Well, just
ask your mom.  She will have one.  If she asks what its for, say ya gotta hold
something together...  If she says use a rubberband or use a paperclip,
 go to the store and rip off a box of 50 or so.
    Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side
and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight
side.  The curved part t can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file
down the other end until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many
hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can pick
various locks.  Some locks are so cheap that ya don't even have ta file! But
most are not.
  Ok, now you have a lock pick.  Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how
ya use it.  You look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you
can't tell, you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side
it opens from, , take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of
the horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.
     Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the
crack) and pull the lock up and down.  The lock will then open because the
pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing us thieves to open it.  Don't
say bullshit until you've tried it.  Because I have gotten lots of beer money
from doin' this to fellow students' gym lockers.
  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never picked a
Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but if anyone
does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very
tight so ya can't get the pick in.  So, if you're locking something valuable
up, use a Master, cuz at least ya know I won't be picking it and I'm sure
there aren't that many that could.  And when I say pick, i don't mean lighting
a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock without  using
force, making a substitute key, etc...
    If any of you believe that this information is not sufficient for picking
an American lock, or any other kind besides Master, leave me a message at
/\/\etallant 1 (503) 538-0761.   This concludes my text file on picking
combination locks. My next text file will probably be "Picking key locks".
See ya later, The Byte basher.

      How to pick MASTER locks  By Gin Fizz & Ninja NYC
 
    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master
combination locks and failed? Well then read on.  The Master lock company has
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme.  If you pull the handle of it
hard, the knob won't turn.  That was their biggest mistake......  Ok, now on
to it.
 
    1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.
1: The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination),
pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move.  2: While pulling on
it turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more.  Then add 5 to this
number.  Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.
 
    2nd number.  (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times,
then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the
1st number once.  WHEN you have bypassed.  Start pulling the handle and
turning it. It will eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the
groove pull on it and turn the knob.  If it is loose go to the next groove; if
it's stiff you got the second number.
 
    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2
numbers, then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on
it.  The lock will eventually open if you did it right.  If can't do it the
first time, be patient, it takes time.
 
Addendum 4/12/91:  I've tried this, and it no longer seems to work (master 
wised up)

HOWEVER- the "MASTER warded padlock" locks are easily picked...

These are the lock with the keys that look like this:

   _                                                       _
  / \_[]_[]__[]_[]    A cross section looks like this:  \_/ \
  \_/ [] []  [] []

Just file the key down so it looks like this:

   _                                                       _
  / \___________[]    A cross section looks like this:  ~~~~~
  \_/           []

Now you can bypass the wards... sometimes you have to pull the key up and
down, turning as you pass each block, to release the latch.

   PYROTECHNICAL DELIGHTS
                               WRITTEN BY RAGNER ROCKER

  Many of you out there probably have fantasies of revenge against teachers,
principals and other people who are justassholes.  depending on your level of
hatred of this person i would advise that you do some of these following
experiments:

  (1) Pouring dishsoap into the gas tank of your enemy- many of you already
know that gasoline + dishsoap(e.g.  joy, palmolive, etc.) form a mixture
called napalm.  now napalm is a jelly-like  substance used in bombs,
flamethrowers, etc.  now you can only guess what this mixture would do to
someone's fuel line!!!!

  (2) Spreading dirty motor oil/castor oil on someone's exhaust pipe- when
the exhaust pipe heats up(and it will!!)the motor oil or castor oil on the pipe
will cause thick, disgusting smoke to ooze forth from the back of that car.
Who knows maybe he/she might be pulled over and given a ticket!!

  (3) Light Bulb Bomb- see part one of the file

 (4) Simple smoke/stink bomb- you can purchaase sulphur at a drugstore under
the name flowers of sulphur.  now when sulphur burns it will give off a very
strong odor and plenty of smoke.  now all you need is a fuse from a
firecracker, a tin can, and the sulphur.  fill the can with sulphur(pack very
lightly), put aluninum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into
the foil, insert the wick, and light it and get out of the room if you value
your lungs.  you can find many uses for this( or at least i hope so.
 
                 FUN WITH ALARMS
 
A fact I forgot to mention in my previous alarm articles is that one can also
use polyurethane foam in a can to silence horns and bells.  you can purchase
this at any hardware store as insulation.  it is easier to handle and dries
faster.

Many people that travel carry a pocket alarm with them.  this alarm is a small
device that is hung around the door knob, and when someone touches the knob his
body capacitance sets off the alarm.  these nasty nuisences can be found by
walking down the halls of a hotel and touching all the door knobs very quickly.
if you happen to chance upon one, attach a 3' length of wire or other metal
object to the knob.  this will cause the sleeping business pig inside to think
someone is breaking in and call room service for help.  all sorts of fun and
games will ensue.


    Some high-security instalations use keypads just like touch-tone pads (a
registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm alarms.  most
use three or four digits.  to figure out the code, wipe the key-pad free from
all fingerprints.  after it had been used just apply finger print dust and all
four digits will be marked.  now all you have to do is figure out the order.
if you want to have some fun with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at the
same time.  many units use this as a panic button. This will bring the owner
and the cops running and ever-one will have a good time.  never try to remove
them from the wall, as they all have tamper switches.
 
    On the subject of holdups, most places (including super-markets, liquer
stores, etc.) have what is known as a money clip.  these little nasties are
placed at the bottom of a money drawer and when the last few bills are
with-drawn a switch closes and sets the alarm off.  that's why when you make
your withdrawl it's best to help your-self so you can check for these little
nasties.  if you find them, merely insert ones underneath the pile of
twenties, and then pull out the twen-ties, leaving the one-dollar bill behind
to prevent the circuit from closing.

If you shoplift and see cameras, look at the brand.  if it is surveillance video
systems (SVS) you need not worry.  these cameras look realistic to the point of
pilot lights, coax, and scanning.  however, they are only empty boxes.


How to make TNT       By THE SCREAMER
 
       Probably the most important explosive compond in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene).  This and other very similar types of high explosives ar
all used by the military, because of their fantastic power- about 2.25
millions pounds per square inch, and there great stability.  TNT also has the
great advantage of being ableto be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be
poured into shells, mortars, or any other projectiles.  Military TNT comes in
containers which resemble dryu cell batteries, and are usually ingnited by an
electrical charge, coupled with an electical blasting cap, although there are
other methods.

Preparation of TNT
 
1.  Take two beakers.  In the first prepare a solution of 76 percent sulfuric
acid, 23 percent nitric acid and 1 percent water.  In the other beaker,
prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent sulfuric
acid (percentages are on a weig ht ratio rather than volume).
 
2.  Ten grams of the first solutions are poured into an empty beaker and placed
in an ice bath.

3.  Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
4.  remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.

5.  Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is held for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will
begin to form on the top of the acid.

6.  After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and
cooled to 45 degrees C. when reaching this temperature, the oily liquid will
sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the remaining
acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
 
7.  Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temperature is SLOWLY being raised to 83 degrees C.  After this
temperature is reached, it is maintaind for a full half hour.

8.  At the end of this period, he solution is allowed to cool to 60 degrees
C>, and is held at this temperature for another full half hour.  After this,
the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more only the oily liquid at the
bottom.

9.  Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accoumplished
slowly and gently.

10.Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second acid
solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 dgregrees C> to 104
degrees C., and is held for three hours.

11.After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.  and
held there for a half hour.

12.After this half hour, the oil is removed form the acid and washed with
boiling water.

13.After the washing with boiling water, while being stired constantly, the
TNT will begin to solidify.

 14.When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker, so
that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have a good
quality TNT. NOTE: the temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are EXACT,
and must be used as such.

  DO NOT estimate or use aproximations.  Buy a good centigrade thermometer.

 El Pirata's Guild On How To Make A Chemical Fire Bottle
 Written for: Toxic Oyster Guild  05/12/85

Materials Required:
==================

    Sulphuric Acid (Battery Acid)                  Gasoline
    Potassium Chlorate (Drug Store)                Sugar
    Glass bottle w/stopper (roughly 1 quart size)  Small bottle or jar w/lid
    Rag or absorbent paper(newspaper,towels, etc.)
    String or rubber bands

Procedure:
=========

1) Sulphuric Acid Must be Concentrated. If battery acid or other dilute acid
is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are given off.
Container used should be of eenamelware or oven glass.

CAUTION: Sulphuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is
 spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also
 dangerous and should not be inhaled.

2) Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temerature.

3) Pour gasoline into the large (1 quart) bottle until it is approximately
2/3 full.

4) Add concentrated sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle is
filled to within 1' to 2' from top.  Place the stopper on the bottle.

5) Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION: If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous to handle
 during use.

6) Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside
 of the bottle.  Tie with string or fasten with rubber bands.

7) Dissolve 1/2 cup (100 gm) of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup (100 gm) of
sugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.

8) Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and cap tightly. The
cooled solution should be approx.  2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid.  If  there is
more liquid than this, pour off excess before using.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.


                 How To Use:

1) Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
around the large bottle.  Bottle can be used wet or after solution has dried.
However, when dry, the sugar - Potassium chlorate mixture is very sensitive to
spark or flame and should be handled accordingly.

2) Throw or launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard surface
 (target) the fuel will ignite.

Conclusion:
==========
 This weapon proves to be very useful in torching Assholes and/or their
possessions.  Use your imagination.

TIME DELAYED CHEMICAL FUSE
 
1) Put 1 teaspoon full of of potassium permanganate in a tin can.
2) add glycerine
3) wait 3-4 min.
4) get the hell out..  the stuff will smoke, then burst into flame..

** potasium permanganate stains like iodine but worse [it's purple]
** the reaction will spatter a bit ->it can be messy...
** it doesn't matter if the amounts are uneven [ie.  1 part to 3 parts]



                    THERMITE
 
This stuff can burn *anything*.  [except Tungsten]..  It's great for burning
open a fortress fone [a pay phone, for those who do not know]
 
Here is the step-by-step on how to make it.
 
1) First you need rust.  The best way to make alot of it is....
 
  a) get an electric train transformer and attach a common nail to the PLUS
   (+) end of the transformer. take a glass jar and fill it with water, then
   put salt [table salt is fine] into the water. put the other wire into the
   water with the nail [leave the transformer out, of course]. Turn on the
   transformer and let the contraption run overnight. seperate out all the red
   shit [that's the rust] with a filter or a spoon. let the stuff dry [like on
   a paper towel] that's it! you have rust!
 
2) Get some aluminum filings from the hardware store [or shave your own from a
 bar with less that 94% pure aluminum, called duralumin]

3) Now, just mix:
 
   8 grams rust /  3 grams aluminum filings
 
4) That's Thermite!! Now, to ignite it...
 
5) You now need some Magnesium ribbon. To get it, you can:
 
  a) steal it from the chemistry lab at school
  b) buy it at the hardware store or from a chemical supply house.
 
6) Alright, shove the Magesium ribbon into the Thermite at a fuse.
 
7) Then light it with a blowtorch. [It won't get hot enough to ignite the
 Thermite, though]
 
8) last step: get the hell back. [it can vaporize CARBON STEEL!]


 
EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE RESEARCHER

INTRODUCTION: The trouble with text books on chemistry and explosives is the
attitude with which they are written.  They don't say, "Now I know you would
like to blow holy hell out of something just for the fun of it so here is how
to whip up something in your kitchen to do it".  They tell you how Dupont does
it or how the anchient Chinese did it but not how you can do it with the
resourses and materials available to you.

 Even army manuals on field expedient explosives are almost useless because
they are just outlines written with the understanding that an instructor is
going to fill in the blanks.  It is a fun game to search out the materials
that can be put together to make something go "boom".  You can find what you
need in grocery stores, hardware stores, and farm supplies.  An interesting
point to remember is that it is much easier to make a big e explosion than a
small one.  It is very difficult for a home experimenter to make a
firecracker, but a bomb capable of blowing the walls out of a building is
easy.

   The king of explosives for the do-it-yourselfer is black powder.  It is
easy to make and when properly confined is capable of devestating power.
   It is cheap and works well. Some drug stores sell sulfur under the name
Flowers of Sulfur.  If you use Nitrate of Soda, it will be in the form of
prills (little round beads).  Bake it in an oven at 250 degrees for 10-15
minutes to drive out the moisture.
   Then dump a cup or two into a blender and switch it on.  It will do a
beautiful job of reducing it to powder.  Buy a bag of charcoal briquettes at a
grocery store.  Put a few briquettes in a rag and pound with hammer.  Dump the
result into the blender, grind, then strain through a tea strainer.
   Mix by volume: 6 parts potassium or Sodium Nitrate, 2 parts powdered
charcoal, 1 part sulfur. This mixture will burn if ignited and will explode if
ignited while tightly confined.  It can be greatly improved, however, by
processing it as follows:
    Moisten with water until it will stick together when pinched between thumb
and finger.  Press it into a disposable aluminum pie pan.  Bake in a preheated
oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes--get it totally dry.  Grind into as
fine a powder as possible.  A mortar and pestle is best.
    If you use a blender at this point, there is a danger of explosion.  It is
not very sensative to friction or impact, but is very sensative to sparks.  If
you followed these directions, you should have a fine slate-grey powder.
    When baking black powder, remember to preheat the oven.  Place your pie
pan approximately in the center of the oven.  Do not set it on the bottom of
the oven.

  These warnings are to prevent hot spots that could ignite the powder causing
a fire or explosion.  Something went wrong once when my father-in-law was
doing this and it blew the door right off the oven.  His training in military
demolitions included field expedient explosives.  The point is that things can
go wrong even when you know what you are doing.  Protect yourself at all
times.  Use common sense.  Wear safety glasses; don't stand in front of oven,
etc.

                         HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
  Take a flat piece of plastic or metal (brass or aluminum are easy to work
with and won't rust).  Drill a 1/16th inch hole through it.  This is your die
for sizing the fuse.  You can make fuses as big as you want, but this is the
right size for the pipe bomb I will be getting to later.

   To about 1/2 cup of black powder add water to make a thin paste.  Add 1/2
teaspoon of corn starch. Cut some one foot lengths of cotton thread.  Use
cotton, not silk or thread made from synthetic fibers.  Put these together
until you have a thickness that fills the hole in the die but can be drawn
through very easily.

  Tie your bundle of threads together at one end. Separate the threads and
hold the bundle over the black powder mixture. Lower the threads with a
circular motion so they start curling onto the mixture.  Press them under with
the back of a teaspoon and continue lowering them so they coil into the paste.
Take the end you are holding and thread it through the die.  Pull it through
smoothly in one long motion.

  To dry your fuse, lay it on a piece of aluminum foil and bake it in your 250
degree oven or tie it to a grill in the oven and let it hang down.  The fuse
must be baked to make it stiff enough for the uses it will be put to later.
Air drying will not do the job.  If you used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even
dry completely at room temperatures.

Cut the dry fuse with sissors into 2 inch lengths and store in an air tight
container.  Handle this fuse carefuly to avoid breaking it.  You can also use
a firecracker fuse if you have any available.  The fuses can usually be pulled
out without breaking.  To give yourself some running time, you will be
extending these fuses (blackmatch or firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.

                          HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK
   Use heavy cotton string about 1/8th inch in diameter.  You can find some at
a garden supply for tieing up your tomatoes.  Be sure it's cotton.  You can
test it by lighting one end.  It sould continue to burn after the match is
removed and when blown out will have a smoldering coal on the end.  Put some
sulfur in a small container like a small pie pan and melt it in the oven at
250 degrees.
    It will melt into a transparent yellow liquid.  If it starts turning
brown, it is too hot.  Coil about a one foot length of string into it.  The
melted sulfur will soak in quickly.  When saturated, pull it out and tie it up
to cool and harden.
  It can be cut to desired lengths with sissors.  2 inches is about right.
These wicks will burn slowly with a blue flame and do not blow out easily in a
moderate wind. They will not burn through a hole in a metal pipe, but are
great for extending your other fuse.  They will not throw off sparks.
Blackmatch generates sparks which can ignite it along its length causing
unpredictable burning times.


    Now you have the basic ingredients to shake the earth like thunder.  In
the next installment or two, I will tell you how to put it all together to do
just that.  You will find that you have baked a very deadly pie.  I have twice
been accused of setting off dynamite in the woods.  The explosive power of
your little grey powder may exceed your expectations, so choose your testing
ground with care.


                           HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB
   Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
good drill bit.
    Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly on one end.
Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.  Do not pack
the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it settle.  You want
the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need dry, fine powder
sitting loose in a very rigid container.
    Wipe off any powder that has gotten onto the top or threads of the pipe.
Gently screw on the second cap.  Hand tighten only. Place a small piece of
tape over the hole and go to your test site.  Remove the tape and insert a two
inch piece of black match fuse or a firecracker fuse into the hole.  Place the
bomb behind a large rock or tree.
     Using thread or string, lightly tie a 2 inch piece of sulfured wick to
the end of the fuse. Avoid letting the wick touch any objects.  This might
cause it to go out. Light the wick and head for cover in a direction that
keeps the rock or tree between you and the bomb at all times. Get behind cover
at least 50 yards away.  You may not expect such a large explosion from such a
small object.
     Be extra cautious until You have done this a time or two and it gets real
what you are dealing with.  The pipe will be blown to pieces which will fly
through the air like bullets.  An accident could seriously wound or kill you.
This is not a big firecracker.  It is more like a hand grenade.  The size of
the bomb can be increased by using a larger pipe and caps.

    To make a big noise without blowing up your pipe, cap one end only. Drill
a 1/16 hole at the top of the threads at the capped end.  Put in about 3 to 4
rounded teaspoonsful of powder. Pack about 2 inches of wadding on top of the
powder.  Toilet paper or kleenex is good for this.  Pack it tight.  Open up a
safety pin and stick it into the hole.  Work it around to loosen up the powder
so a fuse can be inserted.  When this goes off, the recoil will be tremendous.
You will loose your pipe unless you brace it securely against something.

    The pipe can be reloaded and used again.  A fun trick is to mount the pipe
pointing upward.  Drop a tin can over the open end and light the fuse. The can
will be blown high into the air.  Campbell's soup cans are great for this.



                           HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL

   This is easy to make and fun to play with.  Mix equal parts by volume
Potassium or So dium Nitrate and granulated sugar.  Pour a big spoonful of
this into a pile. Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into it; light; and step
back.  This is also a very hot incendiary.  A little imagination will suggest
a lot of experiments for this.

                             ANOTHER ROCKET FUEL

 Mix equal parts by volume of zinc dust and sulfur.  Watch out if you
experiment with this.  It goes off in a sudden flash.  It is not a powerful
explosive, but is violent stuff even when not confined because of its fast
burning rate.

  --- As I continue from this point some of the ingredients are going to be
harder to get without going through a chemical supply.  I try to avoid this.
I happen to know that B. Prieser Scientific (local to my area) has been
instructed by the police to send them the names of anyone buying chemicals in
certain combinations.  For example, if a person were to buy Sulfuric acid,
Nitric acid and Toluene (the makings for TNT) in one order the police would be
notified.  I will do the best I can to tell you how to make the things you
need from commonly available materials, but I don't want to leave out
something really good because you might have to scrounge for an ingredient.  I
am guessing you would prefer it that way.

                 HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON MATCHES

 The word "safety" in safety matches is misleading.  The chemical on the heads
of safety matches is a powerful explosive.  It is similar to black powder but
has a lower ignition temperature (more sensative to heat) and unlike black
powder is easily detonated by impact.

  This feature moves it up into the high explosives class. To test this, lay a
paper safety match on a hard flat surface and hit the head sharply with a
hammer.  What do you know! It goes bang! To collect a quantity of this
explosive, it is best to use wooden safety matches.  Buy several cartons.
They're cheap.  Note that these should be safety matches, not the strike
anywhere kind.


  Pinch the head near the bottom with a pair of wire cutters to break it up;
then use the edges of the cutters to scrape off the loose material.  It gets
easy with practice.  You can do this while watching TV and collect enough for
a bomb without dying of boredom.
    Once you have a good batch of it, you can load it into a pipe instead of
black powder.  Be careful not to get any in the threads, and wipe off any that
gets on the end of the pipe.  Never try to use this stuff for rocket fuel.  A
science teacher was killed that way.
      Just for fun while I'm on the subject of matches, did you know that you
can strike a safety match on a window pane? Hold a paper match between your
thumb and first finger.  With your second finger, press the head firmly
against a large window.  Very quickly, rub the match down the pane about 2
feet while maintaining the pressure.  The friction will generate enough heat
to light the match.

  Another fun trick is the match rocket.  Tightly wrap the top half of a paper
match with foil.  Set it in the top of a pop bottle at a 45 degree angle.
Hold a lighted match under the head until it ignites.  If you got it right,
the match will zip up and hit the ceiling.

 I just remembered the match guns I used to make when I was a kid.  These are
made from a bicycle spoke.  At one end of the spoke is a piece that screws
off.  Take it off and screw it on backwards.  You now have a piece of stiff
wire with a small hollow tube on one end.  Pack the material from a couple of
wooden safety matches into the tube.  Force the stem of a match into the hole.
It sould fit very tightly.  Hold a lighted match under the tube until it gets
hot enough to ignite the powder.  It goes off with a bang.

--- For later projects, like a chemical time delay fuse, you will need some
concentrated sulfuric acid.  So, I better tell you how to make it.


           HOW TO MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM BATTERY ACID

 Go to an auto supply store and ask for "a small battery acid".  This should
only cost a few dollars (about 4 dollars).  What you will get is about a
gallon of dilute sulfuric acid.  Put a pint of this into a heat resistant
glass container.  The glass pitchers used for making coffee are perfect.

 Do not use a metal container.  Use an extension cord to set up a hotplate out
doors.  Boil the acid until white fumes appear.  As soon as you see the white
fumes, turn off the hot plate and let the acid cool.  Pour the now
concentrated acid into a glass container.  The container must have a glass
stopper or plastic cap -- no metal.  It must be air tight.  Otherwize, the
acid will quickly absorb moisture from the air and become diluted.  Want to
know how to make a time bomb that doesn't tick and has no wires or batteries?
Hold on to your acid and follow me into the next installment.

                   HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:

    To get an understanding of how this is going to work, mix up equal parts
by volume Potassium chlorate and granulated sugar.  Pour a spoonful of the
mixture in a small pile and make a depression in the top with the end of a
spoon.  Using a medicine dropper, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid
in the depression and step back.
     It will snap and crackle a few times and then burst into vigorous flames.
To make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a plastic drinking straw.  Tamp a
small piece of cotton in one end.  On top of this put about an inch of the
clorate/sugar mixture.
    Now lightly tamp in about a quarter inch of either glass wool or asbestos
fibers.  Secure this with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4 drops of sulfuric
acid.  After a few minutes the acid will soak through the fibers and ignite
the mixture.
    The time delay can be controled by the amount of fiber used and by varying
how tightly it is packed.  Don't use cotton for this.  The acid will react
with cotton and become weakened in the process.  By punching a hole in the
side of the straw, a piece of blackmatch or other fuse can be inserted and
used to set off the device of your choice.

     Potassium chlorate was very popular with the radical underground.  It can
be used to make a wide variety of explosives and incendiaries, some of them
extremely dangerous to handle.  The radicals lost several people that way.
But, don't worry.  I am not going to try to protect you from yourself.  I have
decided to tell all.  I will have more to say about Potassium chlorate, but
for now, let's look at a couple of interesting electric fuses.


                         HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUSE

   Take a flashlight bulb and place it glass tip down on a file.  Grind it
down on the file until there is a hole in the end. Solder one wire to the case
of the bulb and another to the center conductor at the end.  Fill the bulb
with black powder or powdered match head. One or two flashlight batteries will
heat the filament in the bulb causing the powder to ignite.

                            ANOTHER ELECTRIC FUSE

    Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it.  Attach it
to the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few turns and
then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire. You want
about 1/2 inch of steel strand between the wires.  Number 18 or 20 is a good
size wire to use.
     Cut a 1/2 by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in match covers.
Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and press it flat.
place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact with the
powder. Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.
     The strand should be surounded with powder and not touching anything else
except the wires at its ends. Place a piece of blackmatch in contact with the
powder.  Now put a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under
on the two ends.  Press it down so it sticks all around the powder.
      The wires are sticking out on one side and the blackmatch on the other.
A single flashlight battery will set this off.

                              ELECTRIC FUSE # 3

   An excellent electric fuse can be bought ready made at hobby and toy
stores.  They are sold for setting off model rockets.

                         MORE SPONTANIOUS COMBUSTION

 Some of the ingredients for these can only be had from a chemical supply so
they are not my favorites.  Look for powdered aluminum at a good painting
supply.

                                  METHOD # 1
 Scatter out a few crystals of chromic anhydride.  Drop on a little ethyl
alcohol.  It will burst into flame immediately.
                                  METHOD # 2
  Mix by weight, four parts ammonium chloride, one part ammonium nitrate, four
parts powered zinc.  Pour out a small pile of this and make a depression on
top.  Put one or two drops of water in the depression. Stay well back from
this.
                                  METHOD # 3
  Put one gram of powdered potassium permanganate into a paper cup.  Drop two
drops of glycerine onto it.  After a few seconds it will burst into flames.


                                  METHOD # 4
  Spoon out a small pile of powdered aluminum.  Place a small amount of sodium
peroxide on top of this.  A volume the size of a small pea is about right.
One drop of water will cause this to ignite in a blinding flare.
                                  METHOD # 5
  Mix by volume 3 parts concentrated sulfuric acid with 2 parts concentrated
nitric acid. Hold a dropper of turpentine about 2 feet above the mixture.
When drops strike the acid they will burst into flame.

                        HOW TO MAKE NITROGEN TRIIODIDE

 Here are some notes I took four years ago on how to make this wild explosive
that can be detonated by a fly walking on it.

  Five grams iodine, three grams potassium iodide, 20 ml.  concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, filter paper, funnel.

  Stir the potassium iodide and iodine together in a beaker with 50 ml. of
water.  Add the ammonium hydroxide with stirring until no more precipitate
forms.
  Filter and spread a thin layer of the wet solid on several filter papers.
Break the filter papers into many small pieces and allow to dry for several
hours.  On drying, the paper is extremely sensitive to touch and will explode
violently with the slightest disturbance.  Can be handled safely when wet.  Do
not let any sizeable quantity of the dry material accumulate.
--- I was able to buy concentrated ammonium hydroxide from a photographic
supply.

I.  COMMON "WEAK" EXPLOSIVES.

 A.  GUNPOWDER:
  75% POTASSIUM NITRATE
  15% CHARCOAL
  10% SULFUR

  The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder (seperately!) with a mo
rter & pestle.  If gunpowder is ignited in the open, it burns fiercely, but if
in a closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and can
explode the container.  Gunpowder works like this: the potassium nitrate
oxidizes the charcoal and sulfur, which then burn fiercely.  carbon dioxide
and sulfur dioxide are the gases released.

 B.  AMMONAL:
  Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate (a strong oxidizer) with aluminum
powder (the 'fuel' in this case).  I am not sure of the % composition for
ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little using small amounts.


 C.  CHEMICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVES:

 1.  using various chemicals, I have developed a mixture that works very well
 for imitating volcanic eruptions.  i have given it the name 'mpg volcanite'

Here it is: potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate + ammonium nitrate + am
monium dichromate + potassium nitrate + sugar + sulfur + iron filings + charcoa
l + zinc dust + some coloring agent.
 (scarlet= strontium nitrate, purple= iodine crystals, yellow= sodium
 chloride, crimson= calcium chloride, etc...).

                                PEROXYACETONE

 PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK
 SENSITIVE.

MATERIALS-
 4ML ACETONE
 4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
 4 DROPS CONC.  HYDROCHLORIC ACID
 150MM TEST TUBE

Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  then add 4 drops
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to
appear. if no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours.  Swirl the slurry and
filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours.  To
ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at
least a meter away) .

 B.  SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE...

  The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
 reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary

 6 pt. ZINC POWDER
 1 pt. SULFUR POWDER
                       Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.

 There are many other experiments I could have included, but i will save them
for the next chemist's corner article.  upcoming articles will include
glow-in-the-dark reactions, 'party' reactions, things you can do with
household chemicals , etc...

I would like to give credit to a book by shakashari entitled "Chemical
demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some
experiments.

THE CHEMIST'S CORNER #2:    HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG

 This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiments with common household chemicals.  Some may or may not work
depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and
brands.  I would suggest that the person doing these experiments have some
knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.

 I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information.  It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

I.  A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION

VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID              BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE       SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE      CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE            SUGAR: SUCROSE
MILK OF MAGNESIA-MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE   TINCTURE OF IODINE- 4% IODINE
RUBBING ALCOHOL- 70 OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK!)

                           GENERATING CHLORINE GAS

 This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you
shouild know what you're doing before you try this...

 Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'do not mix with chlorine bleach',
and visa-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water with ajax or something
like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and
put ajax in the bottom.  then pour some ammonia down into the bottle.  since
the c hlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use
large amounts of either ajax or ammonia (don't!).  for something fun to do
with chlorine STAY TUNED....

                            CHLORINE + TURPENTINE

 Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into the
bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably start
burning...
                           GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS

 To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with that acid.  Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, magnesium,
etc.  You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter
than air....  l ight a small amount and it burns with a small *pop*.


  Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  this
involve sseperating water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery (or a DC transformer), two
test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes (take them out of an unworking
6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of
water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside
them, with the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to some
wire going down to the electrodes.
   This will work for a while, but chlorine will be generated along with the
oxygen which will corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon
electrodes...  (the table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the
chlorine comes off as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with the water to
form sodium hydroxide....).  therefore, if you can get your hands on some
sulfuric acid, use it instead.  it will not affect the reaction other than
making the water conduct electricity.

Addendum 4/12/91: DO NOT use a transformer that outputs AC current!
   Not only is AC inherently more dangerous than DC, it also produces equal
   amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen at each electrode.

                             HYRDOGEN + CHLORINE

 Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has reacted
with turpentine).  Say "goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The
hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode (depending on purity
and amount of each gas).  An interesting thing about this is they will not
react if it is dark and no heat or other energy is around. When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

                            PREPARATION OF OXYGEN
    Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide (from
a battery- it's a black powder).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off
oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.
     Try lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the
bottle. The oxygen will make it burst into flame. The oxygen will allow things
to burn better...

                                    IODINE
   Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
seperate them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat
it over a candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the
tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it.  The alcohol
should evaporate, and the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine
crystals on the cold metal lid directly above.  If this works (I haven't
tried), you can use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen
triiodide.

CHLOROX-DRAINO   By The Mortician     Sysop of: The Morgue (201)376-4462

 I am not too sure on how this works but I am pretty sure that you can make a
really powerful bomb by taking a can of draino and mixing it with Chlorox. I
think that these two compounds will spontaniously explode so don't just pour
them together.

    I think what you do is get the draino in a cardboard can and then put it
in a bucket of chlorox and what will happen is either the draino or chlorox
will eat through the cardboard and they will meet and explode.

     You might want to experiment with this by rigging it up so you can cause
the two to combine while you stand a distance a way.  I reccomend extreme
caution with this and wear goggles....

  Just like pour some chlorox into a pan and then have a can of draino with a
string tied to it so you can make it spill into the chlorox...  Be Careful. I
don't need a law suit... If you find anything out call The Morgue and leave me
feedback and/or get me in chat and I will update this file with credit to
you....

Addendum 4/12/91:   All this reaction does is produce heat and gas.

   I have found that Pool Chlorine tablets with strong household ammonia react
to produce LOTS of chlorine gas and heat... also mixing the tablets with
rubbing alcohol produces heat, a different (and highly flammable) gas, and
possibly some sort of acid (it eats away at just about anything it touches)

If you have any more info, send me mail:  KADOKEV@IITVAX (Bitnet)
                                          kadokev@iitvax.iit.edu

I'd especially appreciate chemical formulas, or other interesting combinations
(also a source for the pure chemicals in the tablets and in household ammonia)

    Any fool can grow their own marijuana.... just plant the seeds in a warm,
sunny and not too public place, water and fertilize as you would any other
plant, and in a short while you'll have your own homegrown weed. I've heard
that you can kill mites by soaking some tobacco (buy a pack of plain pipe
tobacco) in water, and spraying it on the leaves (you don't want to use toxic
chemicals on something you're going to smoke later)

    If you're not used to the stuff, cut it with 50% tobacco, and smoke it in
a filtered pipe or use the mixture to refill a cigarette- the tar content is
MUCH higher than that of a regular cigarrette.

    Remember, cultivation is a FEDERAL crime, so if you can do it at home,
just pick a room with no windows, and put in some grow lights (sodium vapor
lamps are reputed to be the best- steal a couple streetlights) and a water

                TRIPWIRES                     by The Mortician

    Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the concept.

  You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that
will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 volt
battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can
create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a schematic like this.

  ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||          ->- batery
 wool ||            /
 :==:--- <--fuse    \
  ||                /
  ---- spst switch--\

   So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.
  Note: For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin piece of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

   Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be,bury
it and cover the wires.  Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) and tie
one end to a secure object.  Have your switch secured to something and make a
loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around the switch such that
when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.

   To ignite the explosive...  The thing to do is to experiment with this and
find your best method...  Let me know on any good kills, or new techniques...
On my board... (201)376-4462

  BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES......      BY Vlad Tepes (of Chgo C64 fame)

   Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented,
and which I have found to work better than any other type of release booby
trap.

    There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise
remains the same. What you'll need is 3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft
enough to bend easily (galvanized iron works well), some wire or fishing line,
some string or rope, and a really sick mind.

    Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so
they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, about 30
degrees.

    Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your
nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope or
string so it comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string so the
loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a third nail between the
two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others (see diagrams)

      bent nails
     /                        || ^ slight upward tension
# /\                          ||
#/                         @  ||    @         ( @ are the two nails, head on)
#                  ------!----()------
#          trip wire
 \                     /
Trunk                 third nail

    Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the
other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a
stump etc).

    When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your
sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing
pin). There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be
attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip
wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two
bent nails.

     A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a
hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end is
attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.
               ||
*/\/\/\/\/\-===()=======--------------------------------------*
  SPRING     BOLT            Trip wire

    With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if
it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.

                   RECIPE FOR A STANDARD PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE
 
INGREDIENTS:
 
GASOLINE - 1 PART    OIL - 1 HALF PART      STYROFOAM - 1 PART
 
1) MELT STYROFOAM. -REMEMBER NEVER AT ANY TIME LET THE MIXTURE GET TOO HOT.

Addendum 4/12/91
   Acetone will dissolve the styrofoam, and requires no heat- this is an
 ingredient in nail polish remover, or it is available at any good automotive
 supply store in the paint section.

 A nice trick is to walk into a store, grab a bottle of nail polish remover
 (check the ingredients, it should have acetone in it) then "accidentally"
 pour it into a large stack of (uncoated) styrofoam coolers and wander off.
*End Addendum

2) LET COOL TO A THICK VISCOSITY.
 
3) MIX 3 INGREDIENTS TOGETHER IN FOLLOWING ORDER: FIRST ADD STYROFOAM, THEN
 OIL, THEN GAS.
 
4) MIX IN A DEEP POT - KEEP MIXTURE AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF FIRE! DO THIS STEP
 WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
 
5) LET THE MIXTURE COOL TO A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE - AROUND
 88 DEGREES FARENHEIT.
 
6) MOLD THE MIXTURE HOW YOU WANT. (DIFFERENT SHAPES WILL MAKE IT MORE OR LESS
 LETHAL).
 
OPTIONAL: YOU CAN ADD NUTS, BOLTS, AND SCREWS WHILE MIXING, ALONG WITH
GUNPOWDER, 2 M-80'S, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE TO MAKE IT THE EQUIVILANT
OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.
 
NOTE: THE FRAGMENTS (NUTS, BOLT, ETC.) ARE DEADLY.  THEY WILL PENETRATE A
BRICK WALL WHEN THE MIXTURE IS DETONATED.
 
                                  DETONATION
 
1) THE MIXTURE CAN BE THROWN, BUT SOMETIMES DETONATION DOES NOT OCCUR.
 
2) THE MIXTURE CAN BE WIRED FOR AN ELECTRIC CHARGE TO BE SENT THROUGH IT, IT
 WILL DETONATE WITHOUT DOUBT. A REGULAR FUSE CAN BE SENT THROUGH IT ALSO.  IF
 THIS METHOD IS USED, SOME SORT OF TIMER IS RECOMMENDED.

Addendum 4/12/91: This just burns and smokes, WILL NEVER explode.. don't bother!

 
  Nitroglycerin [heretofore Nitro] is a very powerful high- explosive.  I am
not sure who invented it but he probably didn't-- the first person to make it
probably blew himself up and his friend got the info off his notes.

Well anyway, the next best thing to Nitro is TNT which is ten times harder to
make but also ten times safer to make.  If you can't use common sense then
dont even TRY to make this stuff--a few drops can blow off your hand in the
right circumstances.
 
To make Nitro:
  Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid (for best results it should have a
specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume') with 200 parts sulphuric acid.

  This is going to be HOT at first--it won't splatter if you pour the nitric
INTO the sulphuric but don't try it the other way around.  The acid solutions
together can disolve flesh in a matter of seconds so take the proper measures
for God's sake!!!

 When cool, add 38 parts glycerine as slowly as possible. Let it trickle down
the sides of the container into the acids or it won't mix thourily and the
reaction could go to fast--which causes enough heat to ignite the stuff.

  Stir with a **GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so then CARFULLY pour it into 20
times it's *VOLUME* of water.  It will visibly precipitate immediatly.  there
will be twice as much Nitro as you used glycerin and it is easy to separate.
Mix it with baking soda as soon as you have separated it-- this helps it not
to go off spontainiously.
 
Addendum 4/12/91: Do NOT let the temperature get above 32 degrees centigrade!!!

NOTES: Parts are by weight and he Baume' scale of spicific gravity can be
found in most chem.  books.  You can get fuming nitric and sulfuric acids
wherever good chemicals or fertilizers are sold.

     It is positivly *STUPID* to make more than 200 grams of Nitro at a time.
When mixing the stuff wear goggles, gloves, etc.  When I first made the stuff
I had the honor of having it go off by itself (I added too much glycerine at a
time.)
    I was across the room at the time, but I felt the impact--so did the table
it was on as well as the window it was next to--they were both smashed by only
25 grams in an open bowl. Oh, yes, glycerine you can get at any pharmacy and
you need an adult signature for the acids.  Any bump can make Nitro go off if
you don't add the bicarbonate of (baking) soda--but even with that, if it gets
old I wouldn't play catch with it.
 
Addendum 4/12/91: Freezing it will make it less sensitive to shock.
 
  Once you have made the Nitro and saturated it with Bicarb.  you can make a
really powerful explosive that won't go off by itself by simply mixing it with
as much cotton as you can and then saturating that with molten (but as cool as
possible, of course) parifine--just enough to make it sealed and hard.
Typically, use the same amounts (by weight) of each Nitro, cotton and
paraffin.  This, when wrapped in newspaper, was once known as "Norbin &
Ohlsson's Patent Dynamite," but that was back in 1896.

                            Improvised Explosives
Gelatine Explosive from Anti-Freeze         Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique explosive
exept that it is supple and pliable to -10 to -20 deg.  C
   Antifreeze is easier to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper.  It
needs to be freed of water before the manufacture and this can be done by
treating it with calcium chlor- ide until a specific gravity of 1.12 @ o deg.
C.  or 1.11 @ 20 deg.  C.  is obtained.
    This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the antifreeze and checking
with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride until the proper
reading is obtained.  The antifreeze is then filtered to remove the calcium
chloride from the liquid.  This explosive is superior to nitro-gelatin in that
it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into the explosive and that
the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with.  It is superior in that
the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the nitroethelene
glycol.
   It's detonation properties are practically the same as the nitro-gelatine.
Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if caught on fire the
chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation.  In this
explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium carbonate is a good
idea to reduce the chance of recidual acid being present in the final
explosive.  The following is a slightly different formula than nitro-gelatine:

Nitro-glycol 75%  Guncotton (IMR) 6%  Potassium Nitrate  14%   Flour 5%

    In this process the 50/50 step is omitted.  Mix the potassium nitrate with
the nitro-glycol.  Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as sensitive to
shock as is nitroglycerin.
    The next step is to mix in the baking flour and sodium carbonate. Mix
these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is uniform.  This
kneading should be done gently and slowly.  The mixture should be uniform when
the IMR smokeless powder is added.  Again this is kneaded to uniformity.  Use
this explosive as soon as possible.
    If it must be stored, store in a cool, dry place (0-10 deg.  C.).  This
explosive should detonate at 7600-7800 m/sec..  These two explosives are very
powerful and should be sensitive to a #6 blasting cap or equivelent.
    These explosives are dangerous and should not be made unless the
manufacturer has had experience with this type compound.  The foolish and
ignorant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get to use
them.
    Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for years with
an amazing record of safety.  Millions of tons of nitroglycerine have been
made and used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with very
few mis haps.
   Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main victims are the
stupid and foolhardy.  Before manufacturing these explosives take a drop of
nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and place it on an
anvil.
  Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the anvil.  See what I
mean! This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly.  If there are any
doubts DON'T.

Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Aspirin    by: The Lich

 This explosive is a phenol dirivative.  It is toxic and explosive compounds
made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or handled and
absor- bed through the skin.  The toxicity of this explosive restrict's its
use due to the fact that over exposure in most cases causes liver and kidney
failure and sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.

 This explosive is a cousin to T.N.T.  but is more powerful than it's cousin.
It is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as an
artillery shell filler.  Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar
but thanks to modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in
approximately three hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).

 This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in warm sulfuric
acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the purified
aspirin and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the
final product.  This explosive is called trinitrophenol.  Care should be
taken to ensure that this explosive is stored in glass containers.  Picric
acid will form dangerous salts when allowed to contact all metals exept tin
and aluminum.  These salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive.
They also will cause the detonation of the picric acid.

 To make picric acid obtain some aspirin.  The cheaper brands work best but
buffered brands should be avoided.  Powder these tablets to a fine
consistancy. To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this
powder in methyl alcohol and stir vigorously.  Not all of the powder will
dissolve.  Filter this powder out of the alcohol.  Again wash this powder that
was filtered out of the alcohol with more alcohol but with a lesser amount
than the first extrac- tion.  Again filter the remaining powder out of the
alcohol.  Combine the now clear alcohol and allow it to evaporate in a pyrex
dish.  When the alcohol has evaporated there will be a surprising amount of
crystals in the bottom of the pyrex dish.

 Take fourty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid crystals and
dissolve them in 150 ml.  of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and heat
to diss- olve all the crystals.  This heating can be done in a common electric
frying pan with the thermostat set on 150 deg.  F.  and filled with a good
cooking oil.

When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take the beaker,
that you've done all this dissolving in (600 ml.), out of the oil bath.  This
next step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it is a
good idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure and any
procedure on this disk with good ventilation or outside).  Slowly start adding
58 g.  of sodium nitrate or 77 g.  of potassium nitrate to te acid mixture in
the beaker very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring.  A red gas
(nitrogen tri- oxide) will be formed and this should be avoided.



  The mixture is likely to foam up and the addition should be stopped until
the foaming goes down to prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in the
beaker.  When the sodium or potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is
allowed to cool somewhat (30- 40 deg.  C.). The solution should then be dumped
slowly into twice it's volume of crushed ice and water.  The brilliant yellow
crystals will form in the water. These should be filtered out and placed in
200 ml.  of boiling distilled water. This water is allowed to cool and then
the crystals are then filtered out of the water.  These crystals are a very,
very pure trinitrophenol.  These crystals are then placed in a pyrex dish and
places in an oil bath and heated to 80 deg. C.  and held there for 2 hours.
This temperature is best maintained and checked with a thermometer.

  The crystals are then powdered in small quantities to a face powder
consistency.  These powdered crystals are then mixed with 10% by weight wax
and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting temperature and poured into the
crystals.  The mixing is best done by kneading together with gloved hands.
This explosive should have a useful plsticity range of 0-40 deg.  C..  The
detonation velocity should be around 7000 m/sec..  It is toxic to handle but
simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most demolition work
requiring a moderately high detonation velocity.  It is very suitable for
shaped charges and some steel cutting charges.  It is not as good an explosive
as C-4 or other R.D.X.  based explosives but it is much easier to make.  Again
this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great care.

  AVOID HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE OF
INGESTION. AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE
RETIRE THEM FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.
THIS EXPLOSIVE, IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, AHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH
ANY HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT RECOMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE
UP AS NEEDED.


Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Bleach     by: The Lich

 This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive and explo-
sives of similar composition were used in World War II as the main explosive
filler in gernades, land mines, and mortar used by French, German, and other
forces involoved in that conflict.  These explosives are relatively safe to
manufacture.

  One should strive to make sure these explosives are free of sulfur,
sulfides, and picric acid.  The presence of these compounds result in mixtures
that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly decompose ex- plosively
while in storage.  The manufacture of this explosive from bleach is given as
just an expediant method.  This method of manufacturing potassium chlorate is
not economical due to the amount of energy used to boil the solution and
cause the 'dissociation' reaction to take place.  This procedure does work and
yields a relatively pure and a sulfur/sulfide free product.  These explosives
are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for instigating detonation.

  To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite
solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate etc.) a battery hydrometer, a large
pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals), and some potassium
chloride (sold as salt substitute).  Take one gallon of bleach, place it in
the container and begin heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63
g.  potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated. Bring this
solution to a boil and boiled until when checked by a hydrometer the reading
is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it should read full charge).

 When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the refrigerator
until it's between room temperature and 0 deg.  C..  Filter out the crystals
that have formed and save them.  Boil the solution again until it reads 1.3 on
the hydrometer and again cool the solution.  Filter out the crystals that have
formed and save them.  Boil this solution again and cool as before.

  Filter and save the crystals.  Take these crystals that have been saved and
mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 g.  per 100 ml.
distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool.
Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling.  The process
if purifi- cation is called fractional crystalization.  These crystals should
be relatively pure potassium chlorate.

 Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.  Melt five parts vasoline and five parts wax.
Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above operation) in a
plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately
mixed.  Allow all the gasoline to evaporate.  Place this explosive in a cool,
dry place.  Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds.


 This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density (1.3g./cc.)
and dipped in wax to water proof.  These block type charges guarantee the
highest detonation velocity.  This explosive is really not suited to use in
shaped charge applications due to its relatively low detonation velocity.  It
is comparable to 40% ammonia dynamite and can be considered the same for the
sake of charge computation.

 If the potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the
manufacture pro- cess in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the
wax/vaseline mix- ture.  This explosive is bristant and powerful.  The
addition of 2-3% aluminum powder increases its blast effect.  Detonation
velocity is 3300 m/sec..


Plastique Explosives From Swimming Pool Clorinating Compound    By the Lich

 This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach.  This method of
production of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure
product than does the plastique explosive from bleach process.

  In this reaction the H.T.H. (calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water
and heated with either sodium chloride (table salt, rock salt) or potassium
chloride (salt substitute).  The latter of these salts is the salt of choice
due to the easy crystalization of the potassium chlorate.

  This mixture will need to be boiled to ensure complete reaction of the
ingredients.  Obtain some H.T.H.  swimming pool chlorination compound or
equivilant (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite).  As with the bleach process
mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a dissociation
reaction.  In a large pyrex glass or enamled steel container place 1200g.
H.T.H. and 220g.  potassium chloride or 159g.  sodium chloride.  Add enough
boiling water to dissolve the powder and boil this solution.  A chalky
substance (calcium chloride) will be formed.  When the formation of this
chalky substance is no longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling
hot.  If potassium chloride was used potassium chlorate will be formed.

 This potassium chlorate will drop out or crystalize as the clear liquid left
after filtering cools.  These crystals are filtered out when the solution
reaches room temperature.  If the sodium chloride salt was used this clear
filtrate (clear liquid after filter- ation) will need to have all water
evaporated.  This will leave crystals which should be saved.

 These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a pyrex dish to
drive off all traces of water (40-75 deg.  C.).  These crystals are ground to a
very fine powder (400 mesh).

 If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the crystalization is
much more time consuming.  The potassium chloride is the salt to use as the
resulting product will crystalize out of the solution as it cools.  The
powdered and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together with
vaseline in a plastic bowl.  ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO
FRICTION AND SHOCK AND THESE SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  If sodium chloride is used in
this explosive it will have a tendancy to cake and has a slightly lower
detonation velocity.


  This explosive is composed of the following:

 potassium/sodium chlorate 90%
                 vaseline  10%

   Simply pour the powder into a plastic baggy and knead in the vaseline
carefully. this explosive (especially if the Sodium Chlorate variation is
used) should not be exposed to water or moisture.

 The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the addition of
2-3% aluminum sunstituted for 2-3% of the vaseline.  This addition of this
aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at night which will
ruin night vision for a short while.  The detonation velocity of this
explosive is approximately 3200 m/sec.  for the potassium salt and 2900 m/sec.
for the sodium salt based explosive.

Addendum 4/12/91:

   It was claimed above that this explosive degrades over time. I would assume
that this occurs due to the small amount of water present in the vaseline, and
that a different type of fuel would be better than the vaseline.

               SPEED DEMON 415/522-3074 24 HOURS

   This is from a book by George Hayduke.  It describes a variety of ways to
get back at people who cause you distress.  The book has contains a lot of
tips on causing expensive damage to "marks".  Well, I picked the good ones.
Ones that don't cause a lot of expense, in currency that is.  Well, I hope you
enjoy.  Get back at the losers using the system.  Sort of like piracy and
phreaking.

   In a car with automatic transmission, switch the #1 and #8 wires on the
distributer cap.  This will allegedly allow the car to operate in Neutral and
Park, but the engine mysteriously dies in Drive.
   Castor Oil squirted into the tailpipe of a car, will cause a large amount of
smoke.  Just the thing to help nervous drivers.
   If you can get a bank account number for a person, truly wonderful things
can happen.  Depositing one penny every day can get the employees very pissed.
It happens that given a few hundred wanted posters, one will look like you.
OR anybody else you can imagine.  Close anyway.  Think of all the bounty
hunters just waiting to claim their reward.

   Place an ad in a paper for Male Secretarys only.  $11 an hour, must be
physically attractive, gentle, and other related social traits.  This is for
anybody who has an office.  Give the time to show up one half hour before the
normal opening hour.  For example, if the office opens at 9:00, put the time
to be 8:30.  All these faggots will show up and start bitching at each other
and your loser.
          Run an ad in the local paper with the following message.
"I need all used christmas trees.  Please leave them on my lawn, and I'll pay
$5 for each one." then leave the losers address.  The paper will take your $
and print the ad without thinking.
  If you know the guy is going to throw a party, arrange for him to find out
that somebody was going to crash his party, dressed up like cops.  Then call
the cops telling them of a real rowdy party going on.
   If your college uses computers to handle admissions, try this.  Fill out
course withdrawl forms in the losers name.  Then enter them, they probably
won't check. The guy will go the entire block unknowing, then when grades are
posted.  "Where are mine?" "Why didn't I get grades?"

   Call your colleges administration, tell them you are the undertaker of your
losers hometown.  He just died, please take him off your records, records will
follow.  Then call the parents.  He just died in a fraternity accident.  This
will work better if the guy decides to skip a week or so of classes.
   Instead of credit card fraud, just call up the company and tell them that
you just lost your cards.  You name? Why it's (insert loser)
   If you want, advertise the losers phone number as a Dial A Joke.  For
bigots, Dial A Black, etc.


  If you dislike a fast food place with a drive thru, try this.  Order
everything you can think of.  Then just don't go to the window.  Do it during
dinner hours. Or, order a normal sized meal, but with extra helpings of
mustard.  Then the next car will try the food, then freak out at the joint.
   Garage door openers often have dip switches that can be changed to other
combinations.  The cheaper the model, the better.  Sears sells just the unit.
Say you broke yours or something.  Then change the settings.

    Wax crayons tossed into a wash do wonders to whites or anything else.

   There is a whole section of phun things to do with a phone.  Call in a bomb
threat to a school or something, then leave the handset offhook.  Of course,
do this only at the losers house.  Someone will visit.
     Ads placed in papers saying that (insert loser) will sell YOU! the plans
to a device enabling inexpensive calls.  Mention that you keep no records.  If
you are getting back at somebody with a multi-line system, this is good.
     If you can get a private minute with your marks phone, and the handset is
modular, cover the handset plug with clear nail polish.  The phone rings, then
its unlimited "Hello?" "Hello?"
   Remove the pins from all but one of the hinges of a front door of a
business. The door will work fine, for a while, then fall off.  People start
screaming.
  Add luminescent paint into the cans of someone who is painting their fence.
Then, at night, it glows.
   Get some copper paint and paint a small line across the insulator of a
spark plug in a car.  They'll never find it.
   If your loser gets a parking ticket, get it before he sees it.  Then get a
stamp flicking the cops off.  Send it in with no money.
    If you dislike a pet hater, here's one. Advertise that you(the loser)
would like to buy all unwanted strays.  $10 for each one.  Then call the SPCA,
telling them that the loser wants the animals to conduct black masses and
pagan rites.
         Laxatives slipped into dogfood does wonders.

    Or better yet, toss some normal meat into the dog-owners yard.  Then call
him up(in a disguised voice) and tell him you saw a suspicious person hanging
around the yard....
  Mail a letter to the Chief Executive detailing the sexual acts you would
like to commit, the Secret Service investigates this with no humor.
   PA systems in department stores are great.  Just walk up to a deserted unit,
look around, then deliver the most disgusting statement you can think of.
 Call about thirty people, telling them they just won a sweepstakes.  Answer
the questions, no obligation, it's just to show how generous people are.  Then
give the losers phone number to call for more info.
   Remember two things, hot metal and hot glass do not look different from

  There are many ways to thrash someones car.  But they basicly fall under 2
topics.  These are, 1 to just fuck it up and 2, to distroy it.  As long  as
your at it don't for get to steal the stero & speakers.


                                  Sweet-Gas
 This involves taking the gas cap off of you victims car.  If it is a locking
cap break it off.  Or you might pry it off.  Once you have the gas cap off
pour 4 or 5 pounds of white sugar in there gas tank.  Now when the start there
car up and drive away they will go about 2 miles or so then the car will crap
out and they will have to pay some $'s to get it fixed.

Addendum 4/12/91: This does NOT work- try confectioner's sugar, it might.

                                  Sweet-Oil
 In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in their oil spout.  if
you have time you might remover the oil plug first and drain some of the oil
out.  I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the effects but I am sure
that I did some damage.

                                   Slow Air
 Ok, sneak up the victums car and poke a small hole somewhere in 2 of his/her
tires.  They only have 1 spare.  Now if the hole is small but there then there
tire will go flat some where on the road.  You could slice the tire so this is
blows out on the road wih a rasor blade.  Cut a long and fairly deep (don't
cut a hole) and peel a little bit of the rubber back and cut that off.  Now
very soon there tires will go flat or a possible blow out at a high speed if
your lucky.

                               Vanishing Paint
 Spread a little gas or paint thiner on the victims car and this will make his
paint run and fade.  Vodka will eat the paint off and so will a little 190.
Eggs work great on paint if they sit there long enough.


                                 Loose Wheel
 Loosen the lugs on you victums tires so that they will soon fall off.  This
can really fuck some one up if they are cruising when the tire falls off.

 No name for this one.  but where you pour oil into the engine, pour some
sand, this will scar the head and pushrodes and possible scrach the fuck out
of the cylinder.

                                 Dual Neutral
   This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have there off.  (On
the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now throw some screws, blots, nuts
and assorted things in there and replace the cover. At this point you could
chip some of the teeth off the gears.

                                  Un-Midaser
 Crawl under there car with a rachet and losen all the nuts on their exhaust
so that it hangs low and will fall off soon. This method also works on
transmissions but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the harder you
work the more you fuck them over.

Ok.  Heres a really simple bomb that you can make from things you've probably
got lying around the house...  What you ne eed:

A bag of fertilizer
Some Cotton
Some Starter Fluid (etherous kind)
Some Newspaper

Ok...  You fold the newspaper until its in sort of a pocket shape, then fill
it up with fertilizer (not too much)..  Next, you put cotton on top of the
fertilizer.  Then, pour some starter fluid on it (the fertilizer), wrap up
the newspaper (you can use tape).  Now this isnt the kind of bomb you leave
lying around for a couple days, as it drys out.  When you want to use it, just
light the edge of the newspaper and throw it.  Pretty simple, eh?
 
Addendum 4/12/91:  This is stupid.  Starting fluid is DANGEROUS stuff.
Try it if you like, but I recommend a better detonation technique than
burning newspaper... Maybe a spark plug?

How To Make Mercury Fulminate   by The Lockpic & The Blitz

When employing the use of any high explosive,an individual must also use some
kind of detonating device.Blasting caps are probably the most popular
today,since they are very functional and relativly stable.The prime ingrediant
in most blasting caps and detonating devices in general is mercury
fulminate.There are several methods for preparing mercury fulminate.

1.  Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix is with 35 ml.  of nitric acid.

2.The mixture is slowly and gentle heated.As soon as the solution bubbles and
turns green, one knows that the silver mercury is dissolved.

3.  After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured,slowly,into a small
flask of ethyl alcohol.This will result in red fumes.

4.  After a half hour or so,the red fumes will turn white, indicating that the
process is nearing its final stage.

5.  after a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.

6.  The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small white
crystals.These crystals are pure mercury fulminate,but should be washed many
times, and tested with litmus paper for any remaining undersiable acid.

                                Method No.  2

1.  Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia solution.When ratios
are described,they are always done according to weight rather than volume.

2.  After waiting eight to ten days,one will see that the mercuric oxide has
reacted with the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate crystals.

3.  These crystals must be handled in the same way as the first method
described, in that they must be washed many times and given several litmus
paper tests.


Many other fulminates can be made, however most are extremely unstable and
sensitive to shock.All fulminates including mercury fulminate,are sensitive to
shock and friction,and in no circumstances should they be handled in a rough
or careless manner..

How to Make Ammonium Nitrate  from THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND by: Kurt Saxon
TYPED BY THE REFLEX

Disclaimer:
 I, THE REFLEX, will accept full responsibility for any damage caused by
information obtained from this text-file.  As a matter of fact, I'll let you
sue me and I'll pay.  All you have to do is tell your lawyer, "It's all THE
REFLEX's fault." I'll see you when you get out of the institution.

 Some Militants who don't have much dynamite use ammonium nitrate.  This can
be bought by anyone at $3.75 for and 80 pound bag.  It is fertilizer.
    Ammonium nitrate explodes at rates up to 14,000 feet per second.  It is
roughly compared to dynamite having 60% nitro.

   The fertilizer grade Militants use is mixed with motor oil at the ratio of
one pint of oil to 8-1/2 pounds of ammonium nitrate.  This has to be detonated
with a stick of gelatin dynamite [I didn't say all was easy.  Try to find
another file about that crap.].

    Purified ammonium nitrate can be detonated with a number six dynamite cap.
The pure stuff can be bought at chemical supply houses or the fertilizer grade
can be purified with distilled wood alcohol.

   Put several pounds of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in a pan.  Pour in
enough wood alcohol (methanol) to cover the fertilizer.  Then stir it until a
lot of it has dissolved.  Next, let it set for a few minutes to allow the
impurities to settle to the bottom along with the undissolved ammonium
nitrate.

   Another pan is set on some pieces of dry ice for the next step.  Dry ice
can be found in the business section of the phone book under "Dry Ice." Locker
companies will sell it to anyone, cheaply and in small amounts.

  The dissolved ammonium nitrate is poured into the cold pan.  This is done
carefully so as to leave the impurities and undissolved ammonium nitrate behind.

  The dry ice causes the purified ammonium nitrate to precipitate out of the
solution in crystals.  When no more crystals are formed they are removed from
the alcohol.

  The alcohol is then poured back into the other pan and stirred to dissolve
any ammonium nitrate left undissolved.  After setting a few minutes the
solution is again poured off the dregs and the dregs are thrown away.  When
the last batch of crystals is removed, the alcohol can be stored and reused.

  The dry ice is simply frozen carbon dioxide and its fumes are harmless
unless they are enough to replace the air.  Don't handle the dry ice with your
bare hands [unless you are into pulling your skin off to the bone] as its cold
will cause blisters.

  In order for pure ammonium nitrate to be detonated by a dynamite cap, it
must be very dry.  Spread it out under a heat lamp or in thte sun.  When
completely dry, store it in tightly closed plastic bags.


  You got here on just the right day! For a limited time only, we will be
offering this *BONUS* file to you free with the above file.  That's right! Two
files for the price of one! And only from Omnipotent!

  So you don't know what to do with your ammonium nitrate once you've made it.
You're saying to yourself, "Great! Now I have a chemical that is supposed to
blow things up, but I don't want to destroy anything [ahem?]." Well...

                                 LAUGHING GAS
  As a special treat for the dopers in the audience and since ammonium nitrate
has been on your mind for a few minutes, you might as well learn how to make
laughing gas from ammonium nitrate.
  Laughing gas was one of the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little while of
inhaling the gas the patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't
keep from laughing.  Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.
   Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This is
because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were
inside. They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.
   The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of
the gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bag
under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!
  To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supply
house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.

  First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then you
evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy
brine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when
a drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.

  When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, break
it up and store it in a bottle.

   A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading
into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.

   When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  If
white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

  When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.

Addendum 4/12/91:  N2O supplants oxygen in your blood, but you don't realize
it.  It's easy to die from N2O because you're suffocating and your breathing
reflex doesn't know it.  SO:  Do not put your head in a plastic bag (duhh...)
because you will cheerfully choke to death.

PERIOD, THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE BLACK POWDER.

CAUTION: REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON AS GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK POWDER IS NOW
READY FOR USE!

   EXPEDIENT GRENADES  The Cheshire Cat

   There are many possibilities in the field of grenade manufacture, but for
the most part, when you're dealing with grenades that must  be constructed of
easily available materials, the quality and the  safety of the grenade is
reduced dramatically.

  Here I will deal  with this problem, trying to produce a reasonable type of
grenade  that is relatively safe, can be stored and transported easily, but
produces dramatic effects.  I strongly suggest that if you find it  possible,
you are far better off getting a REAL grenade than trying  to produce one
yourself, but you can be the judge.  As always, I  want to note that this is
all for educational purposes only, and I  do not recommend anyone trying any
of the following for real.

    The first thing you need is explosives.  If you can't get black powder, or
gun powder, or make your own plastic explosives  (we know there sure are
enough text files floating around to explain  how to make all of the above!)
than you're really in a for making a  grenade of this type.

  You'll also need a coffee can, a smaller sized  can (probably like an orange
juice can, or V8), a coat hanger, and a  fuse.  As for explosives, mercury
fulminate is extremely good  for this sort of thing.

 You could probably get together a ton  of firecrackers and take out the black
powder (if you're desperate)  or get a couple quarter sticks from someone.
The explosive goes in the juice can.  Don't pack  it together too tight.
Loose black powder is better than compressed.   This is the main explosive.

 Cut up the coat hanger into little  pieces approximately 1/2" long and fill
up the coffee can until you  can put the juice can in and the top of the juice
can is level with  the top of the coffee can.  If you don't have the time, and
need to  fill up the space faster, chuck in a couple small rocks or pieces of
glass, and stuff like that until you have the bottom of the can filled.

  Now place the juice can in the coffee can, and center it.  Then fill  the
space around the coffee can with coat hanger stuff until the juice  can is
relatively stable.  Put a model rocket fuse in the explosive in  the juice
can.  Leave (at least) 3 1/2" to light from.  If necessary, secure the juice
can or the explosive with some masking tape, ect... as long as it doesn't
interfere with the action of the grenade.

 Take  the lid of the coffee can and cut a hole so that the fuse is exposed.
You now have a fragmentation grenade.  It might be a good idea to  practice
with a football for a while before trying to destroy the  neighbor's garage
with it.

          How to Counterfeit       Written by The Wave
 
  This article deals with how to make counterfeit money.  Before reading this
article it would be a very good idea to get a book about photo-offset
printing, for that's how you'll have to print it.  For someone who is familiar
with offset printing, printing money is a breeze.  Real money is made by a
process called gravure.  It involves carving out of a metal block (but I don't
think anyone can do that by hand-if you can, you should be on That's
Incredible!).  When you are done (if you did everything correctly) you will
have a finished product nearly identical to real money, depending on your
printing skills.  Well, let's get started!

  First I'd like to tell you briefly how offset printing works.  It starts by
making negatives (kind of like when you take a picture with your camera).
Then you take the negatives and put them on a piece of masking material (
usually orange).  Then you expose the STRIPPED negatives or FLATS to a
lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker.  The BURNED plates are then
developed with the proper developer chemical.  These plates (one at a time of
course) are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.  The press to use
should be an 11 by 14 (or so) offset such as the 11 by 17 AB Dick 360.  Then
the printing begins! To learn in detail how to do each of these steps you
should again get a book on the subject.  The presswork takes some practice,
but you'll get the hang of it.
 
    BTW you can
pick up an 11 by 14 offset for about $500 if you shop around (or you can **
BORROW ** a press from your local Insty Prints at about 3:00 in the morning!).
First, like I said before, you need negatives.  Make 2 negatives of the
portrait side of the bill and 1 of the back side.  After developing them and
letting them dry, take them to a light table.  Get some opaque and, on one of
the portrait sides, touch out all the green (the seal and the serial numbers).
Line that one up on the FLAT and leave about 1/2 inch from the top of the
flat.  Then for the other portrait, touch out everything BUT the seal and
serial numbers.  The back side doesn't require any retouching because it is
all one color.

  Now, make sure all the negatives are lined up right, or REGISTERED, on the
flats.  By the way, every time you need another serial number, just shoot 1
neg.  of the portrait side and cut out the serial number. Cut out the old
serial number from the flat and replace it with the new one. Ok, now you have
3 flats, each represents a different color-black and 2 shades of green (which
of course are made by mixing inks).  Now you are ready to burn the plates.
Take a lithographic plate and mark 3 marks on it.  These marks must be 2 &
9/16 in.  apart, starting on one of the short edges.

  Do the same thing to 2 more plates.  Then take 1 of the flats and place it
on the plate, lining the short edge up with the edge of the plate-EXACTLY!
Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you
already burned.  Burn that and do the same thing 2 more times-moving the flat
up one mark.  Then do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a
separate plate).  Develope all 3 plates.  You should have 4 images on each
plate with an equal space between each bill.


                              Roll the Presses!
 
  The paper you will need won't match exactly, but you can make it pretty damn
close (close enough for the cashier at K-Mart!).  The paper to use should have
a 25% rag content.  I have found that Disaperf computer paper works great -
that's the kind that you can barely see the perforation.  Take this paper (cut
the pinfeed holes off first!) and load it into the press.  Be sure to set the
air, buckle, and paper thickness right.

 Start with the black plate (the one with out the serial numbers).  Wrap it
around the cylinder and load black ink in.  Make sure you run more than you
need because there will be a lot of rejects.  Then, while that's printing, mix
the inks for the serial #'s and the back side.  You'll need to add some white
and maybe yellow to the serial # ink. You need to add black to back side.
Experiment till you get it right.  Clean the press and print the other side.
Now you have the bill with no green seal or serial numbers.  Print a few with
one serial number, make another and repeat. Keep doing this until you have as
many different numbers as you want.

  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a paper cutter Now you have a lot
of money, except there is still one problemo - the paper is pure white.  To
dye it, mix the following in a pan: 2 cups hot water, 4 tea bags, and about
16-20 drops of green food coloring (experiment).  Dip one of The bills in and
compare it to a brand new REAL bill.  Make the necessary adjustments, and dye
all the bills.  Then it is a good idea to make them look used.  Wrinkle them,
rub coffee grinds on them, etc.  Congratulations! You're rich!
 
  Some of the info was taken from The Poor Man's James Bond, but most from
personal knowledge.  Also, it would be a good idea to see the movie To Live
and Die in L.A.  It is about a counterfeiter and they did a good job of
showing how to do it.  Well, that's all folks!

Addendum 4/12/91:

     I have heard that there are several methods of detecting CONTERFEIT
money. First, most green ink flouresces under UV light. Second, some money
verifiers sold use MAGNETIC ink and INFRARED detection to tell if the money
is real.

  I do NOT know what the pattern used is, if anybody does, send E-mail.


 HOMEMADE GUNS from  "The Poor Man's James Bond"

                              PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS

    Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years
by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants   make them just for the hell of it or
to shoot once in an   assassination or riot and throw away if there is any
danger of apprehension.

    They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to
force out the spent shell.

    There are many variations but the illustration shows the basic design.

    First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest
in.  The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong
tape.

    The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is punched in the trigger
flap to hold a roofing nail, which is wired or soldered onto the flap.  The
trigger is bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.

    The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe
with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing
through the pipe.

    The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a hole bored through
it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass
through the hole and   rest on the primer.

    To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with
the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the
trigger and the thing actually fires.

    Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store.
All caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.

    Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other.
For instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's copper gas
line. Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the
firing.  So the length of gas line is spread   with glue and pushed into a
wider length of pipe.  This is   spread with glue and pushed into a length of
steel pipe with threads and a cap.

    Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell.
The first size of pipe for a rifle   shell accomodates the bullet.  The second
accomodates its wider powder chamber.

    A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe.  If you want to
comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen inches long.

    Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol. It naturally has
a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.  Also, a small
nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the
front of the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and   brought
around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

    In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it before firing it
by hand.  This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to
where it will do no damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go
off several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go. If the barrel
does not blow up, the gun is (probably) safe to fire by hand.


Astrolite and Sodium Chlorate Explosives By: Future Spy & The Fighting Falcon

Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book
 'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l

Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucking school to kingdom scum!

                                  Astrolite

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's.  Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than
TNT. Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it
isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

                                 Astrolite G
"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual
characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed
easily into the ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite
G has remained detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was
soaked due to rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

              To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
    Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula.  Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

    Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting
hold of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic
hydra-zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization
catalyst, plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic
developers, diving equipment.  Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be
careful with.

                              Astrolite A/A-1-5
Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine.  The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer.  Astrolite A has
a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

                                 Misc.  info
You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water.  Astrolite A&G both should be
able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


                           Sodium Chlorate Formulas

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water.  You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store.  It is used
in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

                          Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder

65% sodium chlorate, 22% charcoal, 13% sulfur, sprinkle some graphite on top.

                                 Rocket Fuel
6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

                      Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)

50% sodium chlorate, 35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' brand),
10% epoxy resin hardener, 5% sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

                              Incendiary Mixture
55% aluminum powder (atomized), 45% sodium chlorate, 5% sulfur

                                Impact Mixture
50% red phosphorus, 50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mix- ed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.

                               Filler explosive
85% sodium chlorate, 10% vaseline, 5% aluminum powder

                            Nitromethane formulas
I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)              specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f                    auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.
Uses:       Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes,
fats, etc.

To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine 2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT.  Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

                       Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
2 parts nitromethane, 5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min.  when done,store in an air-tight container.  This is
supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-glycerin,
and has 30% more brilliance.

 The Firey Explosive Pen   Written by Blue Max of Anarchist-R-Us

 Materials Needed                       Here's a GREAT little trick to play on
 1] One Ball Point `Click` pen          your best fiend (no thats not a typo) at
 2] Gun Powder                          skool, or maybe as a practial joke on a
 3] 8 or 10 match heads                 friend!
 4] 1 Match stick
 5] a sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")

1] Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the top.
2] Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the other little
  parts and the ink fill was.
3] Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in the clicker.
4] Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that they are on
   the inside on the sand paper.
5] Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the pen where
  the ball point comes out.
6] Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder.  The paper is
  to keep the powder from spilling.

The Finished pen should look like this:

     HOW TO BLOW UP A CAR: A different way      by THE FLYING HERMIT

  There are times in a man's life when he gets mad at someone.  And then there
are times when he gets REAL mad at someone.  These are the times for vengence.
And what better way to get back at someone than damaging his/her car.  The
thing which s/he has saved up for, worked hard for, and paid for.
   Yes!!! This is the item which you must attack, for most of the time, it is
parked outside, easily accesible at night and very important to the asshole
you want to annoy.  The method I will describe is relatively easy and safe to
set up, but very effective in causing damage.  The method of destruction will
be explosion.  The explosive device is already inside the car, factory
installed just for you to use.  It is the standard 12 volt car battery.

Let's look at the princleple behind the exploding battery:

You are by now familiar with the theory of how batteries work, and if you
aren't, your probably too young to be thinking of these sorts of things.
Anyway, within the battery, is not only a current flowing from positive to
negative (actually, it is from negative to positive, but that's another
story), but also a small internal resistance.  The resistance inside the
battery is in the order of magnitude of roughly .0024 OHM, an amount so small,
it is usually ignored. But, that is for normal operation of the battery.  The
case we're interrested in is for the closed circuit of the battery by itself.
For a closed circuit, the internal resistance becomes a big deal, and the
following holds true:
                      12volt/.0024 ohm = 5000 amps
   Amazing!!!!! by causing a short circuit (closed circuit), the battery
produces 5000 amps of current running through that little bugger.  However,
this current is short lived, and the battery cannot handle this capacity for
long, so therefore the battery explodes.  It explodes with a rather large
force, causing considerable damage from the pressure, flames, and hurling
lead.  All these goodies combined with the volatile liquids hidden inside the
engine will cause the vehicle to add another member to the big junk yard in
the sky.
   Great!! now we know how to make the car blow up, but we don't want to go up
with hte car, so what we need is a triggering device.  one can go from the
simple to elaborate, by incorporating sophisticated devices such as radio
transmitters, but for our purposes, we will opt for a simple timer and relay
device.
      First, we will need some heavy cable, capable of handling the massive
current without melting, then we will need a relay also able to cope with
large currents.  Next, we need a timer which will count down the seconds to
our triuphant vengance.  And finally, a small battery to run the relay (the
small battery will run both the relay and the timer if you are using a digital
timer).  Now: Connect the small battery to the timer, the timer to the relay,
and the relay to the car battery.  Connect the heavy duty relay to the the car
battery with the heavy cable.  There you have it!!!!

remember, tinkering with other people's property is a no-no, and officer
friendly might get ugly with you if he sees you doing this, so be forewarned.
Also, car batteries are dangerous to play with, and if handled improperly, may
explode unintentionally, causing the concentrated acid to spray in your face,
making you look like the elephant man.  so don't come crying to me when
something happens, cause i'll just laugh at you and possibly urinate over you
if you rub me the wrong way.

            MERCURY BATTERY BOMB!      By Phucked Agent!

Materials:

1 Mercury Battery (1.5 or 1.4 V Hearing Aid), 1 working lamp with on/off switch

  It is VERY SIMPLE!!! Hurray! Kids under 18 shouldn't considered try this one
or else they would have mercuric acid on their faces!

1.  Turn the lamp switch on to see if lite-bulb light up.
2.  If work, leave the switch on and unplug the cord
3.  Unscrew the bulb (Dont touch the hot-spot!)
4.  Place 1 Mercury Battery in the socket and make sure that it is touching
the Hot-spot contact.
5.  Move any object or furniture - Why? There may be sparx given off!
6.  Now your favorite part, stand back and plug in cord in the socket.
7.  And you will have fun!! Like Real Party!!!

If your house is on fire (VERY RARE), get that damm fire blower! This stuph will
NOT destroy your plugs, but maybe the fuse depending how often you do that....
Best try outside or college dorm...  <eof>

 A milk carton bomb is relitively simple and safe.  It's only purpose it to
create a loud noise.

 The ingredients needed to make this are few and easy to aquire.  You will
need a plastic milk carton, lighter fluid(type used in cigarette lighters), a
piece of paper, and a pair of chopsticks.  If you can not obtain chop sticks,
it's okay to substitute them with something that can hold the paper and is
long enough so that you won't be harmed by the flames.

 After acquiring all of the ingredients, you can now start to make the bomb.
The procedure is easy.  First, puncture a hole at the bottom of the milk
carton with a screw driver or equivalent.  Next fill one-fourth of the milk
carton with lighter fluid.

  Place the milk carton in a fairly large area outisde.  Hold a piece of paper
between the chopsticks and light the paper with a match.  Cautiously place the
lighted paper under the hole of the carton and BOOM! You have your loud
explosion with little damage to the surrounding area.  It would be a good idea
to have some water handy to extinguish any flames.

 Be careful when doing this and have fun.
