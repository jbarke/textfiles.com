Ok well what you will do is get some gun
powder(see message on how to make it)
but if you can buy it you are better
off. You can get it at most gun shops
if you are over 18. Now what you do
is go down to a hardware store and buy
lead piping about 4-6 inches long
and 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches thick. 
Get two caps for each pipe. Now drill
a hole in the center of the pipe
through one side. Put one cap on and fill
the pipe up with powder. Put the other
cap on. Sticka long fuse in the hole
and use model glue or something to
keep it in. Then light it and get 
away fast!!!!! The caps will usually
fly off so if you have a target aim
one of the caps at it and leave the other
one 1/2 turn from fully tight. But still
stand way out of range as this is very
dangerous.
