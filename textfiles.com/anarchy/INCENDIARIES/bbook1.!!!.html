      Acetone Peroxide Explosive
      --------------------------
   Acetone Peroxide is a primary explosive that can be made from hair bleach
(Hydrogen Peroxide), acetone, and sulfuric acid. This explosive is to be used
in the fabrication of detonators.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:                      SOURCES:
-----------------                       -------
Hydrogen peroxide                       Hair bleach (15-25 volume content)
                                        Drug stores and hair supply houses

Acetone                                 Hardware stores, drug stores

Sulfuric acid                           Clear battery acid boiled until white
                                        fumes appear

Eye dropper or syringe with glass tube  Drug store

Graduated cylinder (cc or ml) or other
measuring device

Thermometer (0 to 100 degrees C)

Glass containers, beakers

Large pan

Ice and salt

Water

Paper towels or coffee filters

PROCEDURE:
---------
1) Measure 30 milliliters of acetone and 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide
   into a glass container and mix thoroughly.

2) Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing its container in a larger one
   containing a mixture of water, salt, and ice.

Note: Because of the lighter inner container being buoyant in the larger outer
container, it is necessary to secure it so that it wont fall over into the ice,
salt, and water mixture.

3) Cool the acetone/peroxie mixture to 5 degrees C.

4) Add 2.5 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid to the acetone/peroxide
   mixture slowly, drop by drop, with the use of an eye dropper. Stir the
   mixture during the addition of the sulfuric acid with a thermometer, keeping
   the temperature between 5 and 10 degrees C. Should the mixture rise above 10
   degrees C, stop adding the sulfuric acid and continue stirring until the
   temperature drops again to 5 degrees C, then continue adding the sulfuric
   acid.

5) After all the sulfuric acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture
   for another 5 minutes.

6) Let the acetone/peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture stand in the ice/water/salt
   bath or remove the inner container and place it in an ice box for 12 to 24
   hours.

7) After 12 hours white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of
   the once clear solution. Precipitation should be complete after 24 hours.

Caution: At this point the mixture is a primary explosive. Keep away from
shock, friction, and flame.

8) Filter the mixture through a paper towel or coffee filter to collect the
   solid particles.

9) Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel or coffee filter with
   small amounts of ice cold water poured over them. Discard the liquid in the
   container.

10) Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.

Caution: Handle the dry explosive with great care. Do not scrape or handle it
roughly. Keep away from sparks or open flame. Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

      Bullseye (Low-High) Explosive
      -----------------------------
   A highly effective and powerful low-high explosive can be obtained by simply
using a fast burning, double based, smokeless pistol powder called Bullseye.
This propellant is used to reload pistol and revolver cartriges and contains a
sensitive mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.

MATERIAL REQUIRED:                     SOURCES:
-----------------                      -------
Bullseye smokeless pistol powder       Gun and sport shops

Piece of pipe with end caps            Hardware store

Compound detonator or time fuse

HOW TO USE:
----------
1) To use as a low explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end caps
   and ignite with a time fuse. When ignited, the pipe will explode into many
   fragments traveling at a velocity of approximately 600 feet per second. The
   fragmentation can be increased by filing rings around the pipe with a strong
   metal file.

2) To use as a high explosive, just pour the powder into a pipe with end caps,
   insert a compound detonator with a fusing mechanism and detonate. When
   detonated, the pipe will fragment into many small fragments travelling at a
   velocity in excess of 20,000 feet per second.

Note: Because of the unique mixture of nitroglycerin with nitrocellulose
(double-base), Bulleseye is one of the few propellants that can be detonated
with a blasting cap. When detonted, it is as powerful as military TNT and
should be used to defeat hard targets.

      HTH/Naphtha Explosive
      ---------------------
   An explosive munition can be made from granular calcium hypochlorite (HTH,
swimming pool bleach) and petroleum naphtha. This explosive can be detonated
with a compound detonator.

MATERIAL REQUIRED                       SOURCES:
-----------------                       -------
Granular calcium hypochlorite 70%       HTH swimming pool purifier, Swimming
                                        pool supply places

Benzine (petroleum naphtha)             Hardware and paint stores, cleaning
                                        fluid, paint thinner

Mixing container (bowl, bucket, etc.)

Storage container (jar, can) with tight
fitting lid

Blasting cap, compound detonator
required

Strong pipe with end caps               Hardware stores

PROCEDURE:
---------
1) Measure out 32 part by volume, 27 parts by weight, of calcium hypochlorite
   to 1 part by volume, 1 part by weight, of petroleum naphtha into the mixing
   container.

2) Stir until thoroughly mixed with wooden stirring rod

HOW TO USE:
----------
1) This mixture forms a low power/brisant high explosive which should be used
   under strong confinement and only as an explosive filler for antipersonnel
   fragmentation bombs. To use, spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe
   which has an end cap on one end.

2) Insert a compound detonator just beneath the surface of the explosive and
   screw the other end cap on with a hole for the fuse.

Note: Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe. If the mixture
becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to detonate the
explosive.

I-29
      Potassium Permanganate/Aluminum Explosive
      -----------------------------------------
   An explosive munition can be made from potassium permanganate and aluminum
powder. This explosive can be detonated with a compound detonator.

   and rub vigorously with the other flat board or rolling pin until the large
   particles are crushed into a very fine powder (approximately 10 minutes per
   handful).

Caution: Thoroughly clean and dry both boards before using again with a
different substance.

2) Measure two volumes (cups, tablespoons, whatever), 60% by weight, of potass-
   ium permanganate with 3 volumes, 40% by weight, of fine aluminum powder into
   a mixing container with a tight fitting lid. 

3) Secure the lid tightly and shake the mixture for approximately five minutes
   to mix thoroughly.

4) Store the explosive in the mixing container or similar water proof container
   until ready to use. Before using, shake the contents once again to remix any
   settled particles.

HOW TO USE:
----------
1) This mixture forms a low power/brisant high explosive which should be used
   under strong confinement and only as an explosive filler for antipersonnel
   fragmentation bombs. To use, spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe
   which has an end cap on one end.

2) Insert compound detonator just beneath the surface of the explosive and
   screw the other end cap on with a hole drilled through for the fuse.

Measuring container (cup, tablespoon,
etc.)

Mixing container (jar, can) with tight
fitting lid

Two flat boards (like in section I-29
above)

PROCEDURE
---------
1) Spread a handful at a time of potassium chlorate on the large flat board and
   rub vigorously with the other flat board or rolling pin until the large
   particles are crushed into a very fine powder (approximately 10 minutes per
   handful).

Caution: Thoroughly clean and dry both boards before using again with a
different substance.

2) Repeat this process using the sulfur.

3) Measure 7 parts by volume, 11 parts by weight, of powdered potassium
   chlorate and 1 part by volume, 1 part by weight, of powdered sulfur into the
   mixing container.

Caution: This mixture forms an extremely shock sensitive explosive, especially
between two metal surfaces. Reasonable care should be exercised from this point
on.

4) Gently tumble the mixing container between the hands until the ingredients
   are thoroughly mixed together.

5) Place the mixed explosive in a tightly sealed storage container until ready
   to use.

Caution: Do not store the mixed explosive more than 5 days before using. KEEP
THIS EXPLOSIVE DRY AT ALL TIMES!

HOW TO USE
----------
1) This explosive can be used either to fill primer caps for reloading
   ammunition or it can be used to make the following palm-sized fragmentation
   bombs:

A) Obtain a short section of threaded water pipe with two end caps.

B) Thread one end cap onto the pipe and fill 1/4 full with steel ball bearings.

C) Fill the remaining space with potassium chlorate/sulfur mixture and screw
   the remaining end cap on.

Note: Maintain a loose mixture between the ball bearings and explosive by not
over-tamping the explosive into the pipe. This will allow the ball bearings to
move and impact together.

D) GENTLY tumble the pipe between the hands to mix the ball bearings with the
   explosive.

E) When ready to use, throw against or near the target area.
