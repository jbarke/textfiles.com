                               C-4 PLASTIQUE

        One of the most famous and widely used plastique explosive in use
today. This is due to the extremely high performance, good storage
stability, water resistance, high detonation rate and relative low cost.
The manufacture of C-4 was covered in Kitchen Improvised Plastic
Explosives. But the R.D.X. manufacture method (Henning method) has a low
yield. This method yields type A R.D.X. While type A R.D.X. is of high
power the type B R.D.X. covered in the section on R.D.X. manufacture in
this book is of greater power. This type B R.D.X. has a 10% impurity of
H.M.X.. H.M.X. is a greater power explosive than is R.D.X. and has very
desirable explosive properties. This type B R.D.X.is actually the
explosive called for in the military specifications for C-4 manufacture.
        C-4 is cheap because of the polyisobutalene (P.I.B.)
binder/plasticizer used. P.I.B. is widely used in the manufacture of
calking compounds and even used in Bazooka bubble gum. This would be a
possible source of the plasticizer for home C-4 manufacture. The P.I.B.
compound desired should have a molecular weight of over 1,000,000. One
source of this is from Gulf Oil Co. (chemical division) under the product
designation of MM-120. Ethyl hexyl sebacate is available as a plasticizer
component in many chemical and manufacturing processes. Motor oil is
available from any auto parts house or even K-Mart. The solvent used in the
manufacture is unleaded gasoline (Heptane).
        The detonation rate of this explosive will be over 8000 M/sec. This
will yield an explosive identical to the military C-4. It can be used for
any high explosive work such as demolitions and fabrication of shaped
charges. The closest commercial product is the Detaflex series if
explosives as made and distributed by DuPont. These are not the same but
their uses would be very similar.

MANUFACTURE

        Place 21 grams of finely powered polyisobutylene in a glass
container. To this is added 100 ml of unleaded gasoline (camp stove
gasoline). This is allowed to stand until the P.I.B dissolves completely.
To this liquid is added 53 grams of ethyl hexyl sebecate (Di-(2-ethylhexyl)
sebecate) and 16 grams of ten weight nondetergent motor oil. Allow 60 ml of
the gasoline to evaporate and then mix, by kneading with gloved hands, with
910 grams type B R.D.X. (see R.D.X. section of this book). This is kneaded
until a uniform mixture is formed. It is then rolled out thin and allowed
to set for two hours. It is again kneaded for S minutes with gloved hands.
This rolling out and kneading process is repeated until the gasoline can no
longer be smelled. The final product will be plastic from -60 to 170
degrees F. It will be a dirty white to light grey in color and will have
the consistency of a stiff putty. P.E.T.N. could replace all or part of the
R.D.X. as could most crystalline high explosives.
        Acetic anhydride is commonly available and thus most likely could
be bought. The commercial product as always will be more consistent and
much easier and more expedient. This process does however work. Efficiency is
in the 85 to 90% range based on the amount of acetone used.

                                R.D.X. MFG.

KA PROCESS-

        The "KA" process is a modified process for the nitration of
hexamine to R.D.X. It is not as easy as the "E" process but yields are very
good and it requires less acetic anhydride. It does require concentrated
nitric acid (90%+) and requires the hexamine to be nitrated to it's
dinitrate form first. The product does not contain as much H.M.X. as a
byproduct. This amount will be approximately 1-3% H.M.X. The "KA" process
requires smaller amounts of chemicals due to the lower amount of water
produced.
        CAUTION: Nitric acid and acetic anhydride are both very dangerous
chemicals. They are caustic and dangerous. The vapors and all contact with
them should be avoided. This procedure should be done with good ventilation
and with proper protective gear.

PROCESS-
        Dissolve 50 grams of hexamine (see Kitchen Improvised Plastic
Explosives) in 150 ml. of water. To this is added 70 ml. nitric acid (70%)
until the solution is acid to litmus paper. A white precipitate is formed
and is filtered out of the solution. This precipitate is hexamine
dinitrate. It is thoroughly dried and is ready for the next step of the
process. 95 grams of this white dinitrate is placed in a beaker or wide
mouth jar. In another container place 60 grams of ammonium nitrate and 47
grams of 90%+ nitric acid. To the 95 grams of white dinitrate add 228 grams
of acetic anhydride. Add the ammonium nitrate/nitric acid mixture to the
acetic acid/hexamine dinitrate solution. A vigorous reaction will take
place. After the reaction subsides the liquid is filtered. The product thus
obtained is washed twice with cold water twice with boiling water. It is
dried and dissolved in the least amount of boiling acetone possible. This
acetone is chilled and the product will fall out. Reduce the volume of the
acetone to 1/2 by boiling and chill and filter again. Allow the acetone to
evaporate and the type "B" R.D.X. is ready to use.
        CAUTION: Acetone is very flammable and great care should be used in
handling it. Avoid breathing the fumes of acetone.

E. PROCESS-
        This process was developed by the Germans initially prior to WWII.
It is still in use today for the manufacture of Type B R.D.X. Military
specifications for C4 call for type B R.D.X. This is due to the higher
performance of this grade. 10% of the final product is H.M.X. It has much
more power than the R.D.X. component in the final product of the "E"
process.
        The basis for this process is the ease of manufacture of the R.D.X.
Acetic anhydride, ammonium nitrate and paraformaldehyde. Acetic anhydride
is a very common industrial chemical and at the time of this writing can be
purchased for $220.00 per 398 lbs. Ammonium nitrate is available as a
common fertilizer. It's cost is approximately $7.00 for 50 lbs. in it's
fertilizer form. Parafomaldehyde is available as another common industrial
chemical. It is also possible to evaporate the 37% aqueous formaldehyde
solution to dryness to obtain paraformaldehyde. Paraformaldehyde costs at
the time of writing around sixty cents per pound. Thus it is feasible to
make home C4 for under four dollars per pound.
        This process is very simple and requires a minimum of equipment.
This is also a very safe process if the instructions are followed and the
fumes produced by the reaction mixture avoided.

PROCESS:
        Place 260 ml acetic anhydride in a one gallon jar. To this add 105
grams of ammonium nitrate in the acetic anhydride. This is placed in a pan
partially filled with cooking oil. This is heated to 70-90 degrees C. After
reaching this temperature begin an addition of 38 grams of
paraformaldehyde. This addition is done in four 9.5 gram portions.
        CAUTION: This addition will produce fumes that are hazardous and
flammable. This should be done with very good ventilation. Paraformaldehyde
is a cancer causing agent. A mask and gloves should be worn while handling
it. Acetic anhydride and it's vapors are hazardous and all contact should
be avoided. It is caustic and very flammable. Allow the reaction to subside
before the next addition. After all the additions have been made, take the
reaction vessel out of the oil bath and allow it to cool. The crystals of
type "B" cyclonite will form. These crystals are filtered out of the
liquid. Filtering is best done in a vacuum (e.g. Buchner) filtering
apparatus.
        CAUTION: The liquid remaining is glacial acetic acid. Avoid contact
and the fumes.
        This liquid can then be changed back into acetic anhydride in the
process in that section. There is still product dissolved in the glacial
acetic acid. If the liquid is to be turned back into acetic anhydride these
crystals will fall out in the liquid after the acetic anhydride is formed
and could be filtered out after the chemical recovery. If this recovery
step is not desired then dilute the remaining reaction liquid from above
after removal from the oil bath and it's subsequent cooling. All the
crystals will fall out and can be recovered then by filtering. In either
case the product should be washed twice with water, twice with boiling
water. The product is then dissolved in the least amount of hot acetone
possible. Acetone is a common solvent and can be found at any hardware
store or paint store. This saturated solution is then cooled and chilled
and the final product will fall out as crystals. The resulting fine white
to buff colored powder is type "B" cyclonite and is ready to use in
plastique explosive manufacture or other suitable uses.

                           ACETIC ANHYDRIDE MFG.

        Acetic anhydride is a common industrial chemical. It is used for
synthetic polyester manufacturer. It is a highly dehydrated acetic acid
compound. lt is dehydrated by the addition of ketane gas to acetic acid.
The acetic acid produced by the "E" process as a by product is fortified to
it's original anhydride form by the addition of this ketane gas after
filtering out the product from the reaction liquid. Acetic acid is also
readily available from photo developers as a common photography chemical.
Acetone is available from hardware stores or paint stores as a common
solvent. This process reacts the acetone by heat into the necessary ketane
gas and it is subsequently absorbed by acetic acid to form the acetic
anhydride product. This is attractive due to the ability to recycle the
chemicals for other batches.
        CAUTION: Acetic anhydride is a caustic dangerous chemical. It's
vapors are harmful and should be avoided. All contact should be avoided. It
is also highly flammable and should be used with the utmost caution. Wear
appropriate protective clothing.

PROCESS-

        Acetic anhydride is produced by absorption of ketane vapors in
acetic acid. Acetone is injected into a chrome/iron alloy pipe through one
end equipped with a feed valve and assembly. This pipe is previously purged
with argon or nitrogen. The pipe is heated to 650 to 670 degrees C. This
heating can be done by electric heat with a thermostat or by a coal or gas
fired oven. The injection of acetone into the reaction tube is begun when
the proper temperature is reached. The other end of the pipe is attached
to a stainless steel 3/8" tubing. This tubing is placed through a two hole
stopper in a gallon jar placed in a salted ice bath. This is to collect all
unreacted acetone. In the other hole in the stopper on this bottle is
placed a second stainless steel tubing. This goes to another gallon jar
through a two hole stopper. In this jar is placed the acetic acid. The
second hole in this stopper is placed in line for venting purposes. This
line is placed outside or in a safe place for the poisonous fumes to go.
        Acetone is injected slowly into the chrome/iron pipe @ 650 to 670
degrees C. This will react approximately 15-25% of the acetone into
ketane. The vapors from the reactor is directed into the first bottle. The
unreacted acetone will collect here. The ketane vapor will continue through
the tubing to the next jar. The ketane vapors are absorbed here by the
glacial acetic acid. These vapors are absorbed until the density of the
liquid is 1.08 @ 20 degrees C. This is checked by a hydrometer placed in
the glacial acetic acid. At the time this specific gravity is reached the
material in the second jar is acetic anhydride. If glacial acetic acid is
used from previous "E" process filtering then the acetic anhydride will
need to be filtered to remove the remaining type "B" R.D.X.
        CAUTION: Acetone is highly flammable. Great care is needed to
ensure total absence of air in the reactor prior to injection of acetone.
Failure to do this can result in an explosion. The whole reaction should be
done with very good ventilation.

                                NITROMETHANE

        Nitromethane is a powerful component of high explosives mixtures.
It would lend itself easily to plastique manufacture producing very high
power mixtures. Literature produced by other writers on the two component
explosive mixtures claims these Astrolite explosives to be the most
powerful non-nuclear explosives in existence. I suspect this hype was
created to sell books. In short it is a totally erroneous statement. There
are explosives in existence that are much greater in both detonation
velocity and brisance. Explosives containing nitromethane are very
powerful. Their power is greater than Picric Acid and T.N.T.
        Nitromethane is a common solvent. It is prepared industrially by
the vapor phase nitration of methane at 400-500 degrees C. It can also be
prepared by a lab process. Both of these processes are prohibitive due to
the equipment and processes. Both of these are restrictive to someone that
has had a great deal of laboratory experience and knowledge of proper
setups and procedures. Nitro methane is a common solvent and is also used
as a racing fuel (dragracing and formula car) in mixtures with methanol. It
can be purchased from racing suppliers. It is however very expensive and
this could be a very important aspect for a home or small scale
manufacturer. Nitromethane is also available in a premixed model airplane
fuel (35% nitromethane). This is what we will cover below. This explosive
liquid is separated from the castor oil and methanol by a vacuum
distillation. This should yield a product of suitable purity for excellent
performance.


                     SEPARATION FROM HOBBY RACING FUEL

        Obtain some model airplane racing fuel (e.g. SIG Champion 35, SIG
Corporation). This or an equivalent is available from a hobby store.
Plåce one quart in a 2000 ml flask or a narrow necked gallon jar. Place a
one hole stopper in this container with a stainless or glass tubing
running just through the stopper. The other end of this tubing is placed
through another stopper (two hole) fitted into another gallon jar or flask.
This tubing should reach to the bottom of the second container. The second
hole in this stopper is hooked to a vacuum source. The first flask is
placed in a hot oil or water bath at 50 degrees C. The second jar is placed
in a salted ice bath. The vacuum is then drawn. The nitro methane and
methanol will begin to collect in the second container. This is continued
until only about 5-10% of the solution in the first flask remains. The
liquid from the second flask is removed after the vacuum is released. This
is poured into a shallow pyrex or stainless steel pan or dish. Let this set
over night. This will allow the methanol to evaporate. The remaining liquid
is 85-95% nitro methane with the remainder being methanol. This compound
will work almost as well as a pure compound.

LAB PREPARATION:
        Place 500 grams chloroacetic acid and 500 grams cracked ice in a
gallon jar or three liter beaker. Add ten drops of phenolphthalein
indicator solution. Begin adding a cold 40% (sodium) hydroxide (lye)
solution to the mixture in the beaker. This is done until the solution
changes color. The temperature during this addition is kept below 20
degrees C. To this is added 365 grams of sodium nitrite in 500 ml of water.
This mixture is placed in a three liter round bottom flask fitted with a
thermometer dipping down into the solution. A stopper is placed in the
flask with a condensing column in line angling downward from the tip of the
flask. The end of the condenser is placed in a beaker or flask. The
solution in the flask is heated to 80 degrees C. At this point the solution
will begin a reaction and the heat source is turned off. The temperature
will raise to 100 degrees C. The nitro methane vapors with water vapor will
condense in the downward condensor and will collect in the flask or beaker
under the condenser. After the reaction subsides heat is then applied to
the first flask until the temperature of the liquid inside reaches 110
degrees C. The nitro methane will cease it's generation. The solution that
has condensed will be water and nitro methane. The nitro methane for the
most part will separate. The nitro methane formed is separated from the
water by decanting. The water has 1/3 it's weight of sodium chloride
(noniodized salt). This will drop out the nitro methane dissolved in the
water. This is separated and added to the nitro methane from above. This
will yield 125 grams crude nitro methane. This can be purified by
redistilling from calcium chloride. This should only be done by someone
very experienced in chemical laboratory procedures.

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION
        96 grams of methane is passed with 63 grams of nitric acid vapors
through a 316 stainless steel reaction tube. This tube is heated to 475
degrees C. before the gasses are run through the tube. They should stay at
this temperature for only one tenth of a second. They are then cooled and
the nitro methane is then condensed out of the tube by surrounding the tube
with a jacket full of circulating cold water. Yield will run from 70-95% of
theoretical.
        This as you can tell would be difficult to do in a lab set up
without a very great expenditure of time, money and effort.

                         NITRO METHANE PLASTIQUE #1

        This plastique explosive is similar to the Astrolite explosives.
Detonation velocity is high in the 7000-7500 M/sec. range. Brisance is
good as is the detonation pressure produced. This explosive would find uses
in shaped charges and as a standard demolition explosive. It has the
drawback of the nitro methane being very volatile. This would limit the
storage stability of the finished explosive. This of course could be
controlled by storing finished explosives in a cold magazine to reduce this
evaporation tendency. The addition of the glass microballons (microspheres)
is necessary to reduce the density and therefore give a product that has
good detonation tendencies and sensitivity.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 600 grams of nitro methane in a plastic bowl or similar
container. Add to this a mixture of 200 grams ammonium nitrate and 60-70
grams of nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose can be smokeless powder (IMR
type), nitrostarch or guncotton. Add 10ml. acetone and 45 grams of
microballons. This whole mixture is kneaded together with gloved hands for
5-10 minutes until a very uniform mixture has formed. This kneading should
be done carefully to avoid breaking the microballons. The resulting putty
is a high power explosive sensitive to a #6 cap. Store this putty in a cool
place until ready for use. If this is not possible then make up as needed.

                         NITRO METHANE PLASTIQUE #2

        This plastique explosive is very simple to make. It makes use of
the tendency of nitromethane to gelatinize or collidanize nitrocellulose.
The nitromethane used in this process is obtained from model airplane
racing fuel. The fuel used is 35% nitromethane content. Ammonium nitrate
and glass microballons or powdered styrofoam are used. As in other
explosive compositions the glass microballons (microspheres) are used to
reduce the density of the explosive thus sensitizing it to detonation from
a #6 blasting cap. This novel explosive does not require the nitromethane
to be separated out of the model airplane fuel. This explosive will be the
equivalent of 75% dynamite. Brisance is very high and detonation rate
should be around 6000-6600 M/sec.

MANUFACTURE-
        Place 200 grams of 35% nitromethane model airplane racing fuel in a
glass container (jar). Add to this 30 grams IMR smokeless powder (DuPont)
in the racing fuel and let set for three days. The nitromethane will gel
the nitrocellulose (smokeless powder) and after this amount of time the
gooey gelled nitromethane/nitrocellulose is scooped out of the liquid with
a spoon.
        The oil remaining on the goo is allowed to run off and the gelled
nitromethane is then mixed with 210 grams of finely powdered ammonium
nitrate fertilizer. This is kneaded with gloved hands until a very uniform
mixture is obtained. To this putty is added 8-10 grams of microspheres
or powdered styrofoam. This is again kneaded with gloved hands until a
uniform mixture is obtained. This explosive putty is then ready to use. It
may be stored in a cool dry place. If after storage the putty hardens
somewhat the addition of 2-3 grams acet,one after kneading in will return
the explosive to a very soft putty form.

                           COMPOSITE PLASTIQUE #1

        This explosive composition is simple and cheap to make. Unlike
other compositions in this book this composition is as simple as making
bread dough or other similar very familiar processes. This mixture is cap
sensitive but would require it's use in larger quantities than explosives
containing crystalline high explosives. Ingredients are simple to find and
cheap. Hexamine is available as army ration heating tablets. Nitric acid
can be either bought or made (see nitric acid MFG.). Ammonium nitrate is
available as a (common) fertilizer. Sodium nitrate is commonly available
from chemical suppliers. Potassium perchlorate can be obtained from
fireworks suppliers. Guar gum is obtained from oil well drilling mud
suppliers, Henkel Corp. (Minneapolis, Minn.) or other suppliers.

        Detonation velocity is not as high as others but this explosive is
powerful and brisant. Detonation velocity should be around 5500 M/sec. This
explosive should be made up as needed to ensure the gell is good and stiff.

MANUFACTURE-
        In a large mouth gallon jar place 60 ml. of water. In this liquid
dissolve 40 grams of hexamine (see Kitchen Improvised Plastic Explosives
for manufacture instructions). Add nitric acid of any strength available to
this solution until it has a Ph value of 5.0-5.4. This can be checked with
litmus paper (e.g. E Merick brand). The addition of the acid to this liquid
should be done at such a rate so the temperature does not rise above 66
degrees C. To this liquid add 12 grams of potassium perchlorate, 16 grams
of sodium nitrate and 80 grams of ammonium nitrate. This mixture is stirred
until all the solids dissolve into the solution.
        To this liquid add 161 grams of ground ammonium nitrate mixed with
6 grams of guar gum. Stir the mixture until it begins to thicken
appreciably. Dissolve 1/2 gram of potassium dichromate in 1-2 ml. of water
and add into the mixture with stirring. Stir until this crosslinking agent
is thoroughly dispersed throughout the gelled explosive. To this gelled
explosive add 20 grams of very fine aluminum powder. This is stirred or
kneaded (with gloved hands) into the explosive gell. Without this aluminum
addition the explosive will not be cap sensitive. This explosive is then
placed in a moisture free storage place. This gell will only keep 6 months
at ordinary temperature. It would be made up only as needed.

                           COMPOSITE PLASTIQUE #2

        This plastique is a water gell type explosive. It is sensitized
with monomethylamine nitrate. This is formed by the reaction of
formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde with ammonium nitrate. These ingredients
are widely available and are cheap and easy to obtain. Density will range
from .6 to 1.2 G./cc. Detonation velocity will not be as high as other
plastique explosives in this publication. It is however sensitive to an
A.S.A. #6 blasting cap. This reaction is a methylation of the ammonium
nitrate component by the methyl group of the formaldehyde. This while being
a very simple explosive to make has the drawbacks of low detonation
velocity and it is hygroscopic. Protection from moisture is needed. The
gell could be protected by storing in Ziplock plastic bags, jars, plastic
containers and by spooning into polyethylene tubes (2-5 mil.) Larger
charges should be used as very small quantities could give inconsistent
detonation.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 300 grams paraformaldehyde and 300 grams of ammonium nitrate
in a stainless steel pan. Add 65 ml of water and place the lid on the pan.
Heat the liquid to 4045 degrees C. A reaction will take place. It will
generate heat and should then be removed from the heat source. This
reaction should be allowed to run at temperatures less than 95 degrees C.
This can be done by checking the temperature with a thermometer. If the
temperature rises above 95 degrees C. immerse the pan bottom into a dishpan
or similar container filled with cool water. Water should be added to
maintain the liquid level. Let the reaction run into completion and the
foaming will cease (1-2 hours). Sodium hydroxide (lye) is added at this
time to neutralize the formic acid produced as a by product of the
reaction. Water content of this liquid should be 8-10%
        To this liquid is added 39 grams powdered sodium nitrate, 55 grams
powdered sodium perchlorate and 16 grams powdered sulfur. This is stirred
until all the solid is dissolved. Of course the sulfur will not dissolve. 8
grams guar gum is added while stirring. The liquid will thicken. 1/4 gram
of sodium dichromate is dissolved in 1 ml of water and is added to the
thickening explosive gell. It is then stirred until a homogeneous mixture
is obtained. This gelled explosive is then ready to use. Storage life of
this explosive will be 3-6 months in ordinary magazine conditions. Storage
at elevated temperatures will destroy the gell matrix and result in a poor
explosive composition. This explosive is best made as needed. Protection
from moisture is needed in storage and in use.


                                   MYROL
                              (Methyl nitrate)

        Myrol was developed as a substitute explosive by the Germans at the
end of WWII. Myrol is one of the most brisant explosives known. Prior to
this application it was considered inferior to other explosives due to
it's poor storage stability. This instability was due to early manufacture
processes and their tendency to leave acidity in the final product. The
process developed by the Germans in the latter part of the war when
explosives were in short supply and stretching agents and substitute
explosives were used. This manufacture process was a distillation from
the nitration acids instead of the nitroglycerin type nitration used
earlier. This explosive requires only methanol alcohol and nitric and
sulfuric acids. Also required is the nitric acid still from the nitric acid
section of this publication. With simple manufacture and easily acquired
ingredients this is a very attractive choice. Methyl nitrate is less shock
sensitive than nitroglycerin or nitroglycol but is slightly less sensitive
to friction.

MANUFACTURE-

        In a beaker or wide mouthed jar place 125 grams nitric acid (70%)
density 1.42. Add to this 40 grams of concentrated sulfuric acid. CAUTION:
Nitric and sulfuric acid are corrosive and dangerous. Fumes and all contact
with them should be avoided. Proper clothing and protective equipment
should be used!
        To this is added drop by drop with stirring, 40 grams (50 ml.) of
anhydrous methanol alcohol with one gram urea (fertilizer) dissolved in it.
Keep the temperature below 10 degrees C. during the addition by regulation
of the amount of methanol added.
        After all the methanol has been added pour the cold acid mixture
into the 2000 ml erlenmeyer flask in the nitric acid still (see nitric
acid section). This should be done slowly and very carefully avoiding bumps
between the reaction beaker and the flask. This "still" should be cleaned
thoroughly before and after use. To the liquid in the flask add 5 grams of
urea (fertilizer). (Place the stopper in the flask and the second jar of
the clean still is placed into an ice bath.) The first distillation flask
is placed in an oil bath heated to 40 degrees C. This should be done
remotely if possible.
        The vacuum is applied and the methyl nitrate will immediately begin
to come over and collect in the second flask. Yield should be 60 grams of
methyl nitrate. Remove the vacuum immediately when this much liquid is in
the second jar. Add 10 grams of methanol to the liquid in the second jar
and swirl until mixed. Test the Ph of the liquid with Ph paper (E. Merick).
The reading should be between 6 and 7. If it is less, add small quantities
of sodium bicarbonate and test. This is done until the mixture is between 6
and 7 Ph. This is liquid myrol. It will detonate at velocities of 7500-800
M.sec. It is more powerful than T.N.T. and R.D.X. and is one of the most
brisant explosives known.
        CAUTION: Myrol is a dangerous compound. The addition of methanol
reduces the sensitivity of the liquid but caution should be used in
handling this explosive. At no time should flame or other source of
ignition be in the proximity of this myrol mixture. Flame and subsequent
local overheating will cause a high order detonation! Avoid contact with
myrol or finished explosives as this compound like other nitro esters will
cause cardiovascular dilation.

                        METHYL NITRATE PLASTIQUE #l

        This explosive plastique is a very powerful one. Myrol or methyl
nitrate is easily prepared from easily available materials. This plastique
has the drawbacks of extreme volatility and the tendency to cause
cardiovascular dilation. Volatility can be controlled by storage in a
cool or cold place in a sealed container. The physical effect can be
controlled by avoiding contact with the finished explosive and or any form
of a methyl nitrate containing mixture. Cap sensitivity of the explosive
is very good while impact sensitivity is low. Friction sensitivity of myrol
or methyl nitrate is high thus friction should be avoided. Power of the
plastique will be slightly higher than C4 due to the extremely high power
of the myrol (methyl nitrate) explosive ingredient. All that is needed for
this plastique is myrol (methyl nitrate) and I.M.R. type smokeless powder
(DuPont brand available from sporting goods shops) or nitrostarch.
Detonation velocity should be around 7800-8000 M/sec. with unusually high
brisance. This explosive is a better explosive than is C4 except from a
storage standpoint.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 500 grams of Myrol (methyl nitrate) in a plastic bowl. To
this is added with very gentle stirring 50 grams of smokeless powder or
nitrostarch. The mixture will immediately begin to thicken. Continue the
gentle stirring until the mixture takes on the consistency of putty and is
very uniform. This explosive is then stored in a cool dry place in a
container with a nonscrew type
        CAUTION: Avoid contact with the finished product or the myrol
additive. Contact will cause unbearable headaches and continued contact
will result in heart disease. Myrol is friction sensitive and flame
sensitive and care should be taken in handling this explosive liquid and
products made from it.

                        METHYL NITRATE PLASTIQUE #2

        This explosive is a powerful one. Myrol or methyl nitrate is easily
prepared from easily available materials. This plastique has the drawbacks
of extreme volatility and the tendency to cause cardiovascular dilation.
Volatility can be controlled by storage in a cool or cold place in a sealed
container. The physical effect can be controlled by avoiding contact with
the finished explosive and or any form of a methyl nitrate containing
mixture. Cap sensitivity of the explosive is very good while impact
sensitivity is low. Friction sensitivity of myrol or methyl nitrate is high
but in this composition it would be very low due to the ammonium nitrate
(33-0-0 fertilizer) in the explosive composition. Power of the plastique
will be less than C-4 but will still be much more powerful than Picric
Acid or other high power explosives. All that is needed for this plastique
is myrol (methyl nitrate) and I.M.R. type smokeless powder (DuPont brand
available from sporting goods shops) or nitrostarch and ammonium nitrate
(fertilizer grade). Detonation velocity should be around 7200-7500 M/sec.
with unusually high brisance. This explosive is as good an explosive as C-4
except from a storage standpoint. It does have a lower detonation velocity
but has extremely high brisance and gas production upon detonation.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 500 grams of myrol (methyl nitrate) in a plastic bowl. To
this is added with very gentle stirring 50 grams of smokeless powder or
nitrostarch. The mixture will immediately begin to thicken. Continue the
gentle stirring until the mixture takes on the consistency of putty and is
very uniform. The addition of 500 grams of ammonium nitrate in a finely
powdered form and 50 grams of powdered aluminum with stirring is then made.
Stir gently until a very uniform mixture is obtained. This explosive is
then stored in a cool dry place in a container with a nonscrew type lid.

        CAUTION: Avoid contact with the finished product or the myrol
additive. Contact will cause unbearable headaches and continued contact
will result in heart disease. Myrol is friction sensitive and flame
sensitive and care should be taken in handling this explosive liquid and
products made from it.

                                NITRIC ACID

        Nitric acid is the most important acid for home manufacture of
explosives. It is the primary acid used in nitrations. Nitrations produce a
good many explosive compositions. Most commercial nitric acid is a 70%
strength with a density of 1.4 G/cc. This acid is too weak for most
nitrations. The process below will give an apparatus and procedure to make
a 95-100% grade of acid with a density of 1.52 G/CC. This acid is of
sufficient strength to perform most nitrations requiring a strong acid.
Precursors are sulfuric acid 98% (density 1.8), technical 70% nitric acid
or sulfuric acid as above and sodium or potassium nitrate. The sulfuric
acid is available in grocery stores as drain opener and at janitorial or
plumbing suppliers, Battery acid can be used if it is boiled remotely until
white fumes are given off. Technical nitric acid is available from most
commercial suppliers and is available from gallon sizes to drum sized
quantities. Potassium nitrate is available as a stump remover from garden
supply stores or from chemical suppliers. Sodium nitrate is available from
chemical suppliers and as a fertilizer. Ammonium nitrate will also work but
is deemed inferior to the two nitrate salts above.

        CAUTION: Sulfuric acid and nitric acid are caustic agents. Contact
with skin and breathing of vapors could very well be fatal. Use with proper
protective clothing and with very good ventilation.

NITRIC ACID MANUFACTURE-

        In a 2000 ml. erlenmeyer flask place 500 grams technical grade
nitric acid. Add to this 500 grams concentrated sulfuric acid. Obtain or
make a viton stopper to fit this flask. It should have one hole in it to
accept 3/8" 316 stainless steel tubing. Tubing should just reach through
the stopper. The other end of this tubing should be placed through another
viton stopper with two holes in it. The tubing should reach all the way to
the bottom of the gallon jar used to catch the nitric acid. This gallon jar
is placed into a salted ice bath. This ice bath should surround most of the
jug. The other hole of the stopper should have a line running to an
operating vacuum source. The pressure is reduced to ensure the highest
yield possible. Place the flask containing the acid in a frying pan filled
with cooking oil and heat to 220 degrees F. Turn the water on to the
asperator vacuum source and pull a vacuum on the whole system. Nitric acid
will distill over into the gallon jar where it is cooled and is not
affected by the vacuum. Run the setup until there is 500 ml. remaining in
the flask. The vacuum is unhooked and the acid in the gallon jar is ready
for use.
        If the sulfuric acid/nitrate salt is to be used simply place 400
grams sulfuric acid in the flask. 680 grams of potassium nitrate or 580
grams of sodium nitrate is then added. The apparatus is run the same way as
the tech. nitric acid/sulfuric acid process above.

                          NITRIC ACID PLASTIQUE #l

        This nitric acid (Sprengal) explosive exhibits good plasticity and
power. It is corrosive and cannot be handled bare handed. It detonates with
a velocity of 7100 M/sec. It is a stiff sticky gel explosive with plastic
properties. This gel as with other nitric acid gels are easily made and in
fact are simple to make. They have good cap sensitivity and high detonation
rates with very good brisance. They would be a good choice for home
manufacture due to these properties. If the charge were to be placed and
primed for awhile, blasting caps would need to be coated with wax or
paraffin to protect them from the nitric acid in this explosive mixture.
This plastique requires a #8 blasting cap for top performance and reliable
initiation.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 375 grams of 98% nitric acid in a wide mouth fruit canning
jar (Ball, etc.). To this is added slowly with stirring 125 grams of
powdered polymethylmethacrylate resin (Lucite, Plexiglass, Crystalite or
PMMA). This can be obtained in sheet or bar form and powdered with a wood
rasp. This mixture is heated in an oil bath or water bath to 38 degrees C.
and stirred for 45 minutes. The product will have a density of 1.3 G/cc.
Another composition with a less stiff gel and a higher detonation velocity
can be had by mixing as above 410 G. 98% nitric acid and 90 grams of PMMA.
As mentioned above this composition is corrosive and should be stored in a
glass or wax lined container.

        This explosive is another sprengel type explosive using nitric acid
as an oxidizer. Nitric acid used, again is a high strength acid (95%+).
This explosive makes use of another plastic polymer. Polystyrene is a very
common plastic. It is commonly available as foamed packing "peanuts". It is
also used for molded products and molded interior shipping protection for
finished goods. This explosive is very high in detonation velocity and
brisance. It, as with all nitric acid plastiques, makes a good demolition
explosive and would find much use in shaped charges. This explosive has
good storage stability but due to the nitric acid oxidizer it cannot be
handled with unprotected hands. It is cap sensitive and detonates at 7600
M/sec. It is one of the most attractive plastique explosives due to the
easy acquisition of all its ingredients.

MANUFACTURE-

        In a quart jar place 415 grams of 95% nitric acid (see nitric acid
section). 85 grams of polystyrene powder is added. Powdered polystyrene is
made by placing the polystyrene foamed beads in a blender a few at a time.
Blend at high setting until powdered sufficiently. After adding all the
polystyrene heat to 40 degrees C. in an oil or water bath with stirring and
continue stirring for 30 minutes. The compound will set up and become a
tacky gell suitable for plastique explosive applications.
        CAUTION: Nitric acid is corrosive. Use great care when handling and
avoid breathing its fumes. Avoid all contact with the acid and the
finished product. Wear protective clothing and safety equipment. Proceed
only in an area with excellent ventilation!

                    RED PHOSPHOROUS-COFFEE-SILICONE OIL-
                                       
        This plastique is powerful and cap sensitive. It is a high
performance explosive with a 60% dynamite equivalency. It is very similar
to the composition in Kitchen Improvised Fertilizer Explosives. It uses
this explosive's high power and cap sensitivity coupled with a polymerized
silicone oil. The addition of the dried coffee (e.g. instant, freeze dried)
and raises the detonation velocity greatly and subsequently the power. It
is simple to prepare, powerful and cheap. These parameters are very
important to the home explosives manufacturer.

MANUFACTURE-

        Powder 190 grams of ammonium nitrate (powdered fertilizer) and
place in a wide mouthed container of glass or stainless steel. To this is
added 7 grams soybean oil, 2 grams red phosphorous. This is carefully
stirred until a uniform mixture is formed. In a separate container place 14
ml water. In a separate container mix 8 grams of silicone oil (General
Electric Product #SF-96 or equivalent) with 0.1 grams of benzoyl peroxide.
Heat this mixture to 120 degrees C. for ten minutes until a stiff gell is
formed. It is then kneaded with gloved hands into the powdered explosive in
the other container. Knead this composition until it is of a uniform
consistency. When uniform knead in 1 gram of instant coffee. Glassmicro
balloons can be used here instead of said instant coffee. When this mixture
has been kneaded to a highly uniform mixture the explosive is ready for
use. This explosive can be considered the equivalent of 60% straight
dynamite and is sensitive to a #6 blasting Gap at temperatures as low as
-10 degrees F.

                      SILICONE OIL/R.D.X. PLASTIQUE #2

        This explosive like others in this section makes use of the
tendency for some selected silicone oils to polymerize. This results in a
gel matrix of very fine qualities. Resulting explosives prepared with
cyclonite are nearly a equivalent of C-4. They have a slightly lower
detonation velocity. They do however exhibit good plasticity from -65 to
170 degrees F. This would make a good choice for a C-4 alternate explosive.
Charges would have to be increased 15-25% to obtain a use equivalence to
C-4. A good choice for all demolition uses. Detonation velocity will be
around 7000 M/sec. This explosive is easier to make than C-4. This is due
to the ease of preparation of the silicon plasticizer. C-4 is used by the
military due to the cost difference in these explosives. C-4 uses "cheaper"
plasticizers than does this composition. It can be considered a C-4
equivalent for all practical purposes.

MANUFACTURE-

        Two parts of polymerized silicon paste (Dow Corning Silastic 126 or
equivalent) was mixed, in a beaker or stainless steel pan, with 3 1/2 parts
polymerizable silicon oil (General Electric Silicon Oil #9981 or
equivalent). This mixture then would have 0.025 parts benzoyl peroxide
added. This cream like mixture would then be heated slowly to 150 degrees
C. This heating should be done over a period of fifteen minutes. It is then
allowed to cool. It will thicken somewhat with cooling. Take 410 grams
R.D.X. and 45 grams of the gell and place them in a plastic dish (dishpan).
Knead the components together until a uniform mixture is obtained. The
resulting putty can be considered the equivalent of C-4. It is very storage
stable and safe to manufacture. fnord. This results in a gell matrix of
very

                  SILICONE OIL/NITRO MANNITE PLASTIQUE #3

        This plastique is easily made. Precursors would be simple to
obtain. Nitro mannite is a high explosive with great power. It's power is
close to that of nitroglycerin. From the same token the sensitivity to
shock and friction are also similar. Nitromannite's manufacture process is
covered in Kitchen Improvised Blasting Caps. I believe the addition of the
silicon gell to this explosive would desensitize it somewhat. Nitromannite
is sensitive to elevated storage temperatures so they would be best
avoided. Nitromannite has a detonation rate of 8200 M/sec. #4 or #3
blasting caps would most likely set this explosive off well. This is due to
the high sensitivity of the nitromannite explosive filler.

MANUFACTURE-

        Take 1 parts by weight of silicone paste (Dow Corning Silastic 126
or equivalent) and 2 parts silicone oil (Dow Corning product #9996 or
equivalent) and place in a stainless steel pan. Add to this .015 part
benzoyl peroxide. Stir in well. Heat this mixture to 135 degrees for 15
minutes and let the thick gell cool.
        Fifteen parts of this gell are added to 85 parts nitromannite (See
Kitchen Improvised Blasting Caps). These are kneaded until a very uniform
consistency exists.
        CAUTION: Nitromannite is a very sensitive explosive. Great care
would be needed in handling this explosive. Friction and shock sensitivity
is the same as nitroglycerin. This explosive is flame sensitive. Ignition
of this explosive could very well cause it's detonation.

                           SILICONE OIL/AMMONIUM
                          PERCHLORATE PLASTIQUE #4

        This plastique is easily made. Precursors are very simple to
obtain. This mixture of ammonium perchlorate and copper chromite has all
the power that R.D.X. has. I do not believe the detonation velocity will be
as high however. It is cap sensitive and very powerful. The copper chromite
component of this explosive composition is available as a chemical reagent
and as a catalyst. Ammonium perchlorate is widely available as an oxidizer
in pyrotechnics, solid rocket propellants, and JATO motor construction.
This explosive plastique would be a very good choice if the precursors are
available.

MANUFACTURE-

        Take 1 parts by weight of silicone paste (Dow Corning Silastic 126
or equivalent) and 2 parts silicone oil (Dow Corning Product #9996 or
equivalent) and place in a stainless steel pan. Add to this .015 part
benzoyl peroxide. Stir in well. Heat this mixture to 135 degrees for 15
minutes and let the thick gell cool.
        In another container 95 parts of ammoniüm perchlorate are mixed
carefully with 5 parts copper chromite. These are of course finely powdered
before mixing. Mix these together until a uniform mixture is obtained.
Fifteen parts of this gell are added to 85 parts the explosive mixture from
above. This mixture is kneaded until a very uniform consistency exists.
This will yield an explosive of great power and very good plasticity. One
would want to use a #8 cap for this explosive to ensure good performance.

                         SILICONE OIL PLASTIQUE #5

        This plastique is a good choice. It can use a variety of explosives
for the main explosive in the compositions. These are: Picric Acid (Kitchen
Improvised Plastic Explosives), Nitro Starch, P.E.T.N., R.D.X., Pentryl,
T.N.T., Tetranitronapthalene (Kitchen Improvised Blasting Caps) and other
crystalline high explosives. Of course the detonation velocity will vary
per explosive filler used. This plastique will exhibit good plasticity from
-60 to 170 degrees F.

MANUFACTURE-

        A polymerizable silicone oil with a viscosity of 1000 centistrokes
at 100 degrees F. is obtained (G.E. Silicone oil #81245 or equivalent). 500
grams of this oil would be placed in a stainless steel pan. 2.5 grams
benzoyl peroxide is added and the mixture is stirred to mix. It is then
heated to 125 degrees C. and held at that temperature for 10 minutes. This
oil will polymerize to a thick tacky gell.
        This gel is added to 3.3 Kg. of one of the powdered high explosives
(see above). This is kneaded in a plastic container until a very uniform
mixture is obtained. The resulting doughlike mixture would then be ready
for use. This plastique explosive should be sensitive to a #6 cap with most
of the explosive fillers above. The exception would be T.N.T. It would
require a #8 or larger cap for proper detonation.

                           SILICONE PLASTIQUE #6

        This plastique makes use of a polymerizable silicone oil matrix
with a crystalline high explosive. This gives plastique explosives with
good high and low temperature plasticity. Storage stability is good and the
detonation velocity is very high as well as is the brisance. The oil is
gelled by heating with benzoil peroxide. The gell formed is mixed with the
powdered high explosive. This is kneaded with gloved hands until a uniform
mixture is formed. High explosives used can be one of the following: R.D.X.
(see Kitchen Improvised Plastic Explosives or section in this book), PETN
(See Kitchen Improvised Plastic Explosives or the section in this book),
Picric Acid (See Kitchen Improvised Plastic Explosives), Mannitol
Octanitrate (see Kitchen Improvised Blasting Caps), Tetryl (see Kitchen
Improvised Blasting Caps). Explosive performance will vary, of course, with
the high explosive used. R.D.X. and P.E.T.N. will give the highest
performance. This plastique is easily made and has very high performance.
The precursors are not as easily found as other plastique formulations in
this book. Detonation velocity will be between 6700 M/sec. to 8100 M/sec.
This variation will depend upon the high explosive chosen.

MANUFACTURE-

        Obtain a polymerizable silicone oil with a viscosity @ 100 degrees
F., of 1000 centistrokes. Place 150 grams of the oil in a beaker. To this
is added .75 grams of benzoyl peroxide. This peroxide is widely used as a
catalyst in the plastic industry. The mixture is heated with stirring until
the oil polymerizes into a stiff tacky gell. Mix this gell intimately with
850 grams of crystalline high explosive. This is mixed by stirring or
kneading with gloved hands until a very uniform mixture is formed. This
explosive is plastic from -65 degrees F. to 170 degrees F. It is sensitive
to a #6 blasting cap. It is almost an equivalent of C-4 in power and in
usability.

                             NITRO GLYCOL-MFG.

        The manufacture of nitroglycol was covered in Kitchen Improvised
Plastic Explosives. That process made use of ethylene glycol and it's
subsequent nitration with a mixed acid solution. Ethylene glycol is a
common chemical and should be widely available. The process below makes use
of ethanol (drinking alcohol). It is by a reaction broken down into
ethylene gas. This gas is then bubbled through a mixed nitration acid. The
resulting nitrated product consists of nitroglycol and B-nitroethyl
nitrate. This nitration product is separated by hydrolysis and the
nitroglycol in a very pure state is obtained. Ethanol is easily
manufactured from grain or sugar producing substances. A good book on this
process is available from The Mother Earth News, P.O. Box 70
Hendersonville, NC, 28793. This book has a very simple vacuum still that
produces 90% ethanol. This ethanol would work very well in this process.
        Nitroglycol is more powerful than even nitroglycerin and is much
less sensitive. It's detonation rate is over 7800 M/sec. under ideal
conditions. It makes very good plastique explosives. They are however
cardiovascular dilators and great care should be used handling this
explosive oil.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 75 ml ethanol alcohol in a 500 ml. earlenmeyer flask. In the
top of this flask is placed a one hole stopper. Tubing is placed in this
hole and the other end placed through one hole in the next two hole
stopper. This stopper is placed in a 1000 ml. flask as above. In this
second flask is placed 400 grams carbon (ground charcoal or coke) and 150
grams strong phosphoric acid. This is mixed well. The hose inserted in the
stopper is pulled through the stopper until it contacts the bottom of the
flask. In the second hole in this flask's stopper is placed another hose.
In a 600 ml. beaker is placed 114 grams of nitric acid (95% and 186 grams
of strong sulfuric acid (98%). The hose (316 stainless tubing) from the
second flask is placed in this mixture such that it nearly touches the
bottom of the beaker containing the mixed acids. The beaker should be
surrounded by a salt ice bath to keep the temperature down.
        The first flask is heated. Ethanol vapors are generated and go
through the hose to the second flask. In the second flask the ethanol
vapors are reacted to form ethylene gas. This gas is conducted through the
acid resistant hose (316 stainless tubing) and is bubbled through the mixed
acid in the beaker. In this beaker the nitration will take place. If at any
time this acid mixture's temperature goes above 30 degrees stop the gas
generation until the temperature falls to an acceptable level. This
ethylene gas is bubbled through the acid mixture until all of the ethanol
is gasified in the first flask and has been forced into the second reaction
flask
        This should complete the reaction. The nitro glycol mixed with beta
nitroethanol nitrate will form a visible layer on top the acid mixture.
This liquid is sucked off the top of the liquids with a syringe or similar
device. This liquid is placed in a small beaker and warm water is added
(80-90 degrees C.) and is very gently stirred and allowed to cool. This
will decompose the beta nitroethanol nitrate. The nitro glycol will settle
to the bottom of the liquid. Nearly all the liquid is poured off the
nitroglycol leaving a small amount of water with the glycol. Bicarbonate of
soda (baking soda) is added in small quantities until the effervescent
reaction subsides with each new addition. This neutralizes the acid and
the product is separated from the remaining water and is then ready for
use.
        CAUTION: Ethanol and ethylene are very flammable. They should be
used with great care to ensure that they are not ignited. Breathing these
compounds should be avoided. Nitric and sulfuric acid fumes and contact
with them or the chemicals should be avoided. This process should be
done with very good ventilation. Nitro glycol is sensitive to shock,
friction and flame. All contact with nitroglycol should be avoided as
it will cause vascular dilation. Continued or repeated exposure could
very well cause circulatory problems. Mixtures of alcohols and nitroglycol
are much less friction and shock sensitive and are highly desirable (3/1
nitroglycol/alcohol). Care should be exercised to ensure the lack of
acidity in the nitroglycol as this tends to make for an unstable compound!

                           NITROGLYCOL PLASTIQUE


        This plastique makes use of the tendency of nitroglycol to function
as a sensitizing agent. While this explosive in all respects very similar
to dynamite the addition of smokeless powder to the explosive forms very
plastic mixtures. Nitroglycol is a very powerful explosive and should be
used with great care. Any explosive containing nitroglycol. should be
completely free of contaminants and acidity. This explosive is a mixture of
nitroglycol, sodium nitrate and aluminum powder. Brisance of this explosive
is very high. This is due to the nitroglycol and the aluminum powder in
conjunction with the sodium nitrate oxidizing salt. While the detonation
rate is not as high as other plastiques covered in this book the brisance
is very high and this explosive could find use in blasting as well as
different types of munitions loading. Another attractive aspect of this
explosive is the relative low amount of nitroglycol required to achieve
good performance. Moisture in this composition should be avoided as this
could impair the performance and sensitivity of this explosive.

MANUFACTURE

        In a plastic mixing bowl place 200 grams of fine aluminum powder
(Alcan 2100 or equivalent). To this is added 200 grams of sodium nitrate
and 25 grams of IMR series smokeless powder. This is mixed with a plastic
spatula or stirring rod.
        CAUTION: Avoid friction and flame when handling these powders after
their combination. This powder is very highly flammable and any source of
ignition should be avoided. Combustion temperature of this powder will be
in excess of 3000 degrees C. Of course avoid breathing the aluminum powder
at all costs. Exposure to this dust can cause severe respiratory
disfunction. When these are intimately mixed set this bowl aside. 50 grams
of nitroglycol are mixed with 10 grams of acetone. This liquid is poured
into the powdered ingredients in the bowl previously prepared. This mixture
is kneaded with gloved hands until a uniform puttylike explosive remains.
This is the explosive plastique. This explosive should be stored in a
cool place in a sealed container. Evaporation of the acetone will result in
a hardening of the putty. This can however be replaced by adding more
acetone to the mixture and kneading again with gloved hands until the
desired consistency is obtained. This explosive will have a greater
brisance than T.N.T. and a detonation rate of 6000 M/sec.

                                  P.E.T.N.

        Pentaerythrite tetranitrate is a powerful explosive used in many
plastique explosive compositions. It is also the main ingredient in
primacord. It is also the main explosive component in Detaflex explosives
as made by DuPont. It is an explosive of greater power than R.D.X. and has
a somewhat greater sensitivity to caps than does R.D.X. It is powerful and
cheap. This manufacture process has a very high yield with a good stable
product as a result. It is also a good choice for a blasting cap base
charge explosive. Detonation velocity is 8500 M/sec. This is at 1.65 G/cc.
density. The pentaerythrite is the reaction product of four mole weights of
formaldehyde and one mole weight of acetaldehyde. This is reacted in a warm
aqueous solution in the presence of calcium hydroxide. To nitrate this
compound 95% nitric acid and pentaerythrite are all that are needed.
Pentaerythrite is available as a common industrial chemical in the resin
and paint/varnish industries.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 400 ml. of strong nitric acid from nitric acid manufacture
process in an 800 ml. beaker in a salted ice bath. Add three grams urea
(fertilizer) to the acid and allow to cool. One hundred grams of finely
ground pentaerythrite is added to the acid a little at a time with
stirring. Addition is done such that the temperature of the acid mixture
does not go above 5 degrees C. After all the P.E. has been added the
mixture is stirred while keeping temperature below 5 degrees C. for 20
minutes. This mixture is then poured into three liters of water and cracked
ice. The 220 G. of crude product is filtered out of the solution and washed
three times with cold water. It is then placed in a hot 0.5% solution of
water and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). It is then filtered out and
washed again and dried. It is then dissolved in the least amount possible
of hot acetone and allowed to cool. The crystals will fall out of the
solution and are filtered out. The volume of the acetone is reduced to 1/3
it's original volume by boiling and cooled and filtered again. The combined
crystals are then dried and are then ready to use.

        CAUTION: Acetone is very flammable. Keep away from all sources of
ignition and avoid breathing the acetone vapors!

                       DETAFLEX EQUIVALENT PLASTIQUE

        This commercial explosive is very popular for a multitude of uses.
It finds uses from agricultural uses to specialty shaped charge fabrication
to sever offshore oil platform legs off. This is one of the best of the
commercial demolition explosives. It also finds a good use in explosive
welding of metals and other operations of this type. This explosive is very
similar to the C-4 composition given earlier. In fact they can be
considered equivalent. P.E.T.N. is a very powerful explosive. It is
actually more powerful than R.D.X. but is also more friction and impact
sensitive. It makes use of polyisobutalene with ethylhexyl sebecate or
ethylhexyl adipate as the plasticizer. Also small amounts of 10 weight
motor oil are added to increase the plasticity and consistency of the
explosive. One would exercise care in handling P.E.T.N. due to it's
friction sensitivity. In the explosives industry P.E.T.N.is kept water wet
until ready for final manufacture into explosives. These plasticizers are
incorporated into explosive plastiques commercially by heating with the
solvent until dissolved. Water wet R.D.X. or P.E.T.N. is then added and the
heat with stirring is continued under reduced pressure. This is the
quickest method and yields the most uniform product. But this process is
not feasible as other simpler processes work with good results.

MANUFACTURE

        Place 12 grams of polyisobutalene in a container with 70 mi of
unleaded gasoline ("white gas").
        CAUTION: Avoid skin contact with the gasoline and keep away from
all sparks and open flames. Gasoline is highly flammable! Great care should
be used to ensure fumes are avoided.
        When the PIB has dissolved 2.5 grams of 10 weight nondetergent
motor oil is then added. This is allowed to evaporate to 1/2 it's original
volume. To this is added with stirring 2.5 grams of ethylhexyl sebecate or
ethylhexyl adipate. The mixture will begin to thicken. To this thickened
mixture add 200 grams of P.E.T.N. and the mixture stirred until thoroughly
mixed. This is allowed to set with occasional kneading until completely
free of gasoline. When the gasoline smell is gone the grey to off white
pütty is rolled out like bread dough with a rolling pin. This is rolled out
to 2-3 mm thick sheets and cut to size. The resulting sheets of high
explosive are then ready for use. This explosive is better in thin layers
than is C4. This is due to the greater sensitivity of the P.E.T.N.
explosive component. This explosive is storable for 10 plus years with no
decrease in performance. Sensitive to a #6 ASA blasting cap.

                              NITROSTARCH-MFG.


        Nitrostarch is a powerful explosive. It can be considered the
equivalent of nitrocellulose. With a detonation velocity of 6200 M/sec.
(13% nitrogen) at a density of 1.5 G/cc., it is very powerful. It has the
drawback of being very sensitive to friction and residual acid in the
finished product. Acidity can be controlled by neutralization of the acid
in the product with ammonia. This effectively neutralizes all acid in the
nitrostarch product rendering a stable product. While P.E.T.N and R.D.X.
are a good deal more powerful than N.S. it is still an attractive explosive
due to the ease of manufacture and the ease of acquisition of the required
ingredients. Nitric acid is produced by the process described elsewhere in
this book. Sulfuric acid is available as drain opener from janitorial and
plumbing suppliers. Starch is available in the grocery store. Corn starch
will work but tapioca starch is much preferred for this process.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 305 grams of 95-100% acid in a 2000 ml beaker or equivalent.
To this is added slowly 500 grams sulfuric acid (97-100%). This mixing will
generate heat. Cool this acid mixture to 32 degrees C. Surround the acid
mixture container with a cool water bath. Begin the addition with vigorous
stirring of 200 grams of tapioca starch. This addition should be done in
small quantities. Regulate the temperature by the speed of addition.
Temperature should be maintained between 35 40 degrees C. After the
addition is complete continue stirring for 5 minutes. Pour this acid
mixture into twice it's volume of cracked ice water. The nitrostarch will
fall out and should then be filtered out. Wash this granular material three
times with cold water. This washing is of course done by pouring water
through the material in the filter paper. This material is then removed and
placed in a container and 400 ml water is mixed with it. Begin to add clear
ammonia water (grocery stores) to the liquid. Check the pH reading with
test paper (E. Merick brand). Continue adding the clear ammonia water in
small portions until the PH reading is 9. Filter out the product and
again wash with three 200 ml. washings of clear water. The material is then
dried and is ready for use.

        CAUTION: Nitrostarch is friction and shock sensitive. It is also
very flame sensitive. This compound is a high explosive and should be
treated with great care.

                         NITROSTARCH PLASTIQUE-MFG.

        Nitrostarch has been used a good deal in the explosives industry.
This is due to it's low cost and easy manufacture. It can be considered
almost an equivalent of guncotton. Nitrostarch is a good base explosive in
plastiques. It is overshadowed by R.D.X. and P.E.T.N. as well as other high
explosives- However starch (tapioca, corn, potato) is widely available from
grocery stores. This explosive formulation has the disadvantages of poor
storage and very limited plasticity. It is however quick and simple to
manufacture. A homemade grade of nitrostarch would very likely have
residual acidity which would cause storage instability. This explosive uses
nitrostarch in conjunction with short fiber wheelbearing grease to form the
needed plastique. CAUTION: Avoid all flame and friction when handling
nitrostarch. It is highly flammable and friction could cause the premature
explosive of this compound. Also avoid breathing the dust and skin contact
would best be kept at a minimum. This explosive would be cap sensitive to a
#6 blasting cap or equivalent. Detonation rate would be around 5500-5900
M/sec.

MANUFACTURE-

        In a pan place 10 grams of short fiber wheel bearing grease. Heat
this grease until it melts. Let this cool to 75 degrees C. Pour this into
100 grams of nitrostarch. Knead this with gloved hands. This is kneaded
until a uniform mixture is obtained and the material is then ready for use
or storage. Care taken during the manufacture of the nitrostarch to ensure
the absence of acidity is highly recommended for storage stability.

                                  PENTRYL
                 (Trinitro N Nitranilino Ethanol Nitrate)-

        Phenylethanolamine after nitration forms Pentryl. This is not to be
confused with eutectic mixtures of P.E.T.N. and other high explosives. They
are called pentryl also. Pentryl is a very powerful high explosive. It's
detonation velocity is 7300 M/sec. It is 118% as powerful as picric acid
and 130% greater than T.N.T. It is formed by the nitration of
phenylethanolamine. Phenylethanolamine is used in the chemical industry to
inhibit the hardening of styrene plastics. It also finds uses as a chemical
intermediary in other chemical processes. This explosive is very much more
sensitive than T.N.T. and picric acid to friction. Toxicity is listed as
low. Exposure is limited to dermititus and other mild symptoms. This
compound should not be ingested and contact should be avoided. It is
unattractive due to the P.E.A. Precursor and it's acquisition. It is easy
to make and has very high power. It would make a good choice for plastique
explosive manufacture. Other necessary ingredients are sulfuric acid (100%)
and nitric acid (90%). These are readily available or can be made.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 1000 grams of sulfuric acid (95%) or equivalent. To this is
added 100 grams of Phenylethanolamine with stirring. This addition is done
so that the temperature of the acid does not rise above 30 degrees C. After
the P.E.A dissolves in the acid the mixture is added slowly over 15 minutes
to 720 grams of 90% nitric acid. The temperature is maintained during this
addition at 25-30øC. After all the P.E.A./sulfuric acid is added the
mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at 30 degrees C. The temperature is then
raised to 40 degrees and stirred for 30 minutes. The temperature is then
raised to 50 degrees for thirty more minutes with stirring discontinued.
This mixture is then poured into 3 times it's volume Of water/ice and the
resulting product is filtered out. lt is then washed three times with 600
ml water. Then the product is washed with 500 ml water add 25 grams of
sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). lt is again washed with S00 ml of fresh
water and dried. This product is Pentryl. lt may be recrystallized from
benzene if desired for purification.

                      POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE PLASTIQUE

        This explosive makes use of potassium perchlorate as an oxidizer
with several high energy fuels. Plasticity is gained by the addition of a
crankcase oil viscosity increaser such as S.T.P. Oil Treatment. Also the
addition of finely powdered flake aluminum gives this explosive a very high
detonation temperature. Temperature of the detonation will be 3000 4000
degrees C. This explosive will not have the high detonation velocity of
some of the other explosives in this book. Blast coefficient will be very
high with the free hydrogen giving a secondary air blast due to it's
secondary combustion. This explosive would not be a good choice for shaped
charge application as it's detonation velocity will be too low. It could be
used for a variety of other demolition type uses however.

MANUFACTURE-

        Place 400 grams of potassium perchlorate in a plastic mixing bowl.
Add to this 140 grams of finely powdered aluminum (400 mesh). This is mixed
very well with a wooden or plastic stirring rod or spoon.

        CAUTION: When the aluminum powder and potassium perchlorate is
mixed it is flame and friction sensitive. Great care should be used when
mixing these compounds together. Also breathing of aluminum dust is very
hazardous and proper precautions should be taken to avoid this
(respirator).
        When these two components are well mixed add 18 grams of motor oil
additive (S.T.P. Oil Treatment) and knead carefully into the powder. Of
course the kneading is done by hand with gloved hands. This is kneaded
until a very uniform mixture is obtained. The resulting grey putty is then
ready for use. It can be stored for a good length of time but the mixture
should be kneaded well before being stored.
