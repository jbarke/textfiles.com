			     = Flashlight Bomb =
			     ===================

  GET YOURSELF ONE FLASHLIGHT OF ANY SIZE, SHAPE, OR CREED, AND THE
BATTERY/BATTERIES THAT GO ALONG WITH IT.  NOW IT IS TIME FOR AN IMPORTANT
DECISION.  DEPENDING UPON THE TYPE OF BOMB YOU REQUIRE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A
CHOICE IN MATERIALS.  HERE ARE YOUR CHOICES:

[1] MERCURIC CHLORIDE - GAS BOMB
[2] PURE SODIUM+WATER - FLAME BOMB
[3] SULFURIC NITRATE  - ACID BOMB
[4] GUNPOWDER (TNT)   - BOOOOOOOOM!

  NOW, TAKING THE MATERIAL FOR THE TYPE OF BOMB YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE, PROCEED
TO PUT ROCKS, BB'S, GLASS PELLETS, ETC...  IN THE BOTTOM OF A HOLLOWED OUT
BATTERY/BATTERIES, UNLESS YOU ARE MAKING A FLAME BOMB, WHICH IN THAT CASE READ
ON.  THEN LINE A MAGNESIUM STRIP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE FLASHLIGHT APPRERING ON
TOP OF THE FLASHLIGHT SO YOU MAY LIGHT IT.  NEXT, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF
THE EXPLOSIVE YOU CHOSE IN THE BATTERY.  [ NOT YOU MAY LIGHTLY PACK IT IN, BUT
DO NOT HIT IT!!!  MY FRIEND WAS PACKING A HOME-MADE BOMB ONE DAY, AND HAMMERED
THE COVER ON, AND BLEW A HOLE RIGHT THROUGH HIS LIQUOR CABINET ] NEXT, SECURE
THE TOP, LEAVING ROOM TO INSERT THE MAGNESIUM STRIP.  IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

     -----------
     \	       /
      \       /
       \_____/
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BMB !
       ! BBB !
       !     !
       !_____!

  IN THE LAST DIAGRAM, (B) STANDS FOR BATTERY AND (M) FOR MAGNESIUM.  ALSO
INSIDE THE BATTERY SHOULD BE THE AMMO AND THE EXPLOSIVE.

  NOW FOR THE FLAME BOMB...THE SODIUM, SHOULD BE ON THE TOP, AND THE WATER IN A
BABYFOOD JAR.  THE SODIUM USED HERE IS NOT TABLE SALT!!!  YOU WON'T NEED THE
MAG.  STRIP BEAUSE NUMBER 1, BECUASE ALL YOU NEED DO IS HIT THE FLASHLIGHT
AGAINST SOMETHING HARD.  DO NOT HOLD IT---THROW IT AS FAR AS YOU CAN!!!
