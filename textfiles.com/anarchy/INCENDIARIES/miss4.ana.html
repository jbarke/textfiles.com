FLASH POWDER.  Is a chemical mixture that burns extremely fast.  The mixture burns so fast that it appears to burn instantly, producing a bright flash of light.

Flash powder will produce an extremely loud explosion in amounts larger than 4 ounces even when it is not contained. In very small amounts flash powder will produce a very loud explosion when  contained, even in a container made of just a few layers of paper.

Flash powder is usually made from a very fine powdered metal that will burn and an oxidizer.  Powdered aluminum is used the most because it is cheaper. Powdered magnesium and zinc will also work.  The oxidizer can be Barium Nitrate, Ammonium Perchlorate, Barium Peroxide, Strontium Nitrate, Potassium Chlorate, Potassium Perchlorate, Sodium Chlorate, Potassium Permanganate, and any combination of the above.  All the chlorates are friction and impact sensitive, and also the Permanganate.  Potassium Perchlorate is the least sensitive of the Chlorates.

All the chemicals should be crushed into a very fine powder, about 400 mil. or smaller.  400 mil. is about like common kitchen type flour.

Black German Aluminum is a brand name for aluminum powder.  It has a partical size of 400 mil. for 98% of the aluminum material.  The other 2% is larger than 400 mil.  There are other aluminum powders that are equal to or better than Black German Aluminum.

Aluminum Pyro Powder is also a brand name.  The partical size is 70% 400 mil. the other 30% is larger than 400 mil.

FLASH POWDER FORMULAS

1.  This formula is one of the best. It produces a very very extremely loud explosion.  Easy to ignite with a fuse. It is not moisture absorbent.  Not very sensitive to impact or friction.  Sodium Chlorate or Potassium Chlorate can be used instead of Potassium Perchlorate but then it becomes very sensitive to friction and impact.  4 ounces of this mixture will produce an explosion equal to a stick of dynamite.

Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Aluminum Powder (98% -400)    1 oz.

2.  This formula produces an extremely loud explosion almost as good as #1. This is what almost all M-80's, firecrackers, etc. are made with

Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

3.  This formula is equal to #2 and is not sensitive to friction or impact.

Barium Peroxide                9 oz.
50%/50% magnesium/aluminum
powder (98% -200 mil)          1 oz.

4.  This formula works as good as formula #2 but it produces a very  bright flash.  This is what used to be used for the photo flash for the old box type cameras about 100 years ago.

Barium Nitrate                3 oz.
Potassium Perchlorate         3 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    4 oz.

5.  This formula works very good.  It is not very impact or friction sensitive.  It produces a very, very loud explosion.  Potassium perhlorate contains 46.1914 percent oxygen. Almost equal to #2.  Sulfur added to increase quanity of powder without loosing too much power.

Potassium Perchlorate         2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

6.  Ths formula works as good as #5 but it has a disadvantage of being moisture absorbent and it is very impact and friction sensitive.  Sodium Chlorate Contains 45.0937 percent oxygen.  Produces a very, very loud explosion.

Sodium Chlorate               2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder (70% -400)    1 oz.

7.  This formula is very dangerous because it is very sensitive to friction and impact and could explode during the construction of any explosive device.  Potassium Chlorate contains 39.1664 percent oxygen. This formula produces an explosion almost equal to #5 and #6. Used in the manufacture of toy cap pistol caps.

Potassium Chlorate            2 oz.
Sulfur                        1 oz.
Aluminum Powder               1 oz.

8.  This formula is very, very very sensitive to impact, friction, and  static electricity, even more sensitive than #7.  Extremely dangerous.  Will  ignite even when wet.

Potassium Chlorate            6.7 oz.
Red Phosphorus                2.7 oz.
Sulfur                         .3 oz.
Calcium Carbonate              .3 oz.

9.  This formula has slightly less explosive power than #7. It is slightly friction and impact sensitive. Postassium Permanganate contains 40.4691 percent oxygen.  This formula will ignite itself if it gets wet. Very loud explosion.

Potassium Permanganate         2 oz.
Sulfur                         1 oz.
Aluminum Powder                1 oz.

10. This formula produces a very small explosion when ignited in a paper tube. A much louder explosion is produced when it is ignited in a very strong container.  It is impact and friction sensitive.

Potassium Chlorate             7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                  1.5 oz.
Sulfur                         1.0 oz.

11. No information is available about this formula.

Potassium Chlorate              6 oz.
Antimony Sulfide                3 oz.
Sulfur                          1 oz.

12. This formula is a little louder than formula #10.  Impact and friction sensitive.  Produces a small explosion in a paper tube.

Sodium Chlorate                 7.5 oz.
Charcoal dust                  1.5 oz.
Sulfur                         1.0 oz.

13. No information is available about this formula.

Potassium Chlorate             7.5 oz.
Gallic acid                    2.2 oz.
Red gum                        0.3 oz.

CAUTION
-------

The mixture of any chlorate with phosphorus or sulfur is extremely sensitive to friction and percussion and explodes with great violence.

Chlorate explosives must not be stored together with ammonium nitrate explosives since ammonium chlorate which is formed when these two substances are brought into contact, explodes.

When mixing Chlorates with Sulfur, crush all the chemicals seperately. Then place all the chemicals in a bag to be mixed.  Hang the bag from the ceiling, pole or a tree limb. A long pole is then attached to the bottom of the bag.  The long pole is inserted through a wall and the operator stands behind the wall for safety.  The operator can then shake the bag safely.

4 ounces of flash powder has the same explosive power as a stick of dynamite. One gross of M-80 firecrackers is equal to 3 sticks of dynamite.  8 ounces of powder will make 100 M-80's if each contains 1/2 teaspoon of flash powder.

M-80's with 1/4 teaspoon are almost as loud but do not have quite the destructive force as the ones with 1/2 teaspoon of flash powder.
