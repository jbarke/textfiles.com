OPTIONAL: YOU CAN ADD NUTS, BOLTS, AND
SCREWS WHILE MIXING, ALONG WITH
GUNPOWDER, 2 M-80'S, OR ANY OTHER
TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE TO MAKE IT THE
EQUIVILANT OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.

ARE DEADLY. THEY WILL PENETRATE A BRICK
WALL WHEN THE MIXTURE IS DETONATED.
 
============
:DETONATION:
============
 
1) THE MIXTURE CAN BE THROWN, BUT
   SOMETIMES DETONATION DOES NOT OCCUR.
 
2) THE MIXTURE CAN BE WIRED FOR AN
   ELECTRIC CHARGE TO BE SENT THROUGH

   A REGULAR FUSE CAN BE SENT THROUGH
   IT ALSO. IF THIS METHOD IS USED,
