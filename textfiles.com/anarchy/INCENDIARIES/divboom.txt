Common Rocket Fuel 
------------------ 
 
 
Materials: 
  
1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) or Saltpeter. This can be obtained 
    from a drugstore or ordered from a chemical supply house. 
  
2.) Sugar (Powdered is the best) 
  
Procedure: 
  
1.) Mix the two together 1/2 Nitrate and 1/2 Sugar. 
 
2.) Take an old cooking pan and melt the two together. There 
    is NO way for it to ignite. 
  
3.) It should turn into a fudgey looking compound. Pour this 
    compound into a rocket engine such as a cardboard tube 
    and set a fuse into the compound and let the compound harden. 
  
Chlorate Mixtures 
----------------- 
  
NOTE: The main ingredient for this experiment is potassium or 
sodium chlorate.  Both of these will do equally well.  However  
both may prove difficult to find.  Probably the only way to 
get it would be to order it through a chemical supply house. 
  
Materials: 
---------- 
  
1) Potassium chlorate or sodium 
   chlorate. 
  
2) Powdered charcoal 
  
3) Powdered aluminum 
  
4) Sulfur 
  
Procedure: 
---------- 
  
NOTE:  There is no set procedure for making chlorate mixtures. 
The only special thing ABOUT chlorate mixtures is that 
they have a chlorate in them. Experiment with diffiernt 
proportions of each of the ingredients. All of the 
chlorate mixtures I made had no set procedure and I just 
experimented with the proportions of each of the 
ingredients. Most of your mixture however should be 
potassium chlorate or sodium chlorate. 
  
1)  Make sure that you mix the sulfur and charcoal and aluminum 
    first.  You may grind  these in a mortar and pestal to get a good 
    mix of these ingredients. 
  
2)  Add potassium chlorate or sodium chlorate.  Mix them VERY CAREFULLY 
    in the mortar and pestal.  DO NOT GRIND the mixture once the 
    chlorate has been added or it will ignite and burn the shit out of 
    you. 
  
3)  You now may use the mixture for whatever you want to.  Chlorate 
    mixtures are some of the best compositions there are and in 
    my experiences they are the bes except for model  rocket 
    propellant (procedure for making this is given later). 
  
 
> Green Goddess < 
 
Materials 
--------- 
  
1.) Zinc (Zn) <---NOTE: This is not the same as Zinc Oxide! 
 
2.) Sulfur (S) 
  
Procedure 
--------- 
  
1.) Mix the two together 1/2 and 1/2. 
  
2.) MAKE SURE that you mix them very well. The best way to do so is to 
    put the mixture in a jar with a lid and shake it up for 15-60 seconds 
    until it is all a greyish color. 
  
3.) To ignite use a fuse or throw a match into the powder. WARNING 
    this burns very very quickly andproduces smoke. Also it burns at 
    a fairly high temperature. It will surprise you when you throw a match 
    into it. There will be a delay and then all of a sudden 
    it will flash up and is capable of burning the 
    hell out of you. 
 
======================================= 
 
Common Uses 
----------- 
 
 
1.) Rocket Fuel 
 
2.) Bombs <--- NOTE: The best way to do 
    this is to take it and compress it into cardboard tubing. 
 
3.) Smoke bombs (Cardboard tube w/ big hole.) 
 
4.) Flare bombs. 
 
5.) The rest is up to your imagination 
  
GOOD LUCK!

HOW TO MAKE GREEK FIRE 
---------------------- 
  
   1 PARTS  SULFUR (LIVE) 
   2 PARTS  CHARCOAL (OF WILLOW) 
   6 PARTS  SALTPETRE (POTASSIUM NITRATE) 
  
GRIND EACH ELEMENT INTO A FINE POWDER SEPERATLEY WITH A MORTAR AND MIX. 
  
WHEN LIT AND THROWN FLAMING, IT CARRIES THE FLAME WHEREVER IT GOES AND 
SPLATTERS FIRE WHERE IT LANDS. 
  
THE GREEKS USED THIS TO WIN WAR AT SEA.  THE ENEMY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE IT AND EVENTUALLY PERISHED.

HOW TO MAKE GUN PROPELLANT 
-------------------------- 
  
   1.0 PARTS  SULFUR 
   1.5 PARTS  CHARCOAL (CARBON) 
   7.5 PARTS  SALTPETRE (POTASSIUM NITRATE) 
  
(LOOKS FAMILIAR...) 
AS WITH GREEK FIRE, IT IS GROUND SEPERATELY AND MIXED. 
  
THIS FORMULAE PRODUCES GUN PROPELLANT THAT BURNS AT 1312 FEET PER SECOND. 
OR 400 METERS PER SECOND IF YOU THINK IN METRIC.

MERCURY FULMINATES 
------------------ 
 
MERCURY FULMINATE IS A MEDIUM-POWER  
EXPLOSIVE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN BLASTING- 
CAPS, DETONATING DEVICES IN GENERAL, AND AS A STAND-ALONE EXPLOSIVE. 
ALL FULMINATES, INCLUDING MERCURY FULMINATE, ARE SENSITIVE TO SHOCK AND 
FRICTION, AND IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THEY BE HANDLED IN A ROUGH OR 
CARELESS MANNER. 
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
  
MERCURY FULMINATE #1 (SHOCK BOMB) 
--------------------------------- 
  
SHOCK BOMBS, OR MORE PROPERLY,  
FULMINATE OF MERCURY [HG(ONC)2], ARE BOMBS THAT 
EXPLODE WHEN JOLTED IN ANY WAY, SUCH AS LANFING ON SOMEONE'S FEET OR SHOT  
FROM A DISTANCE WITH A BB GUN. 
ADD MERCURY (FOUND IN THERMOMETERS AND STRANGE GADGETS AT RADIO SHACK) TO 
NITRIC ACID (CHEMICALS CATALOGS).  DON'T TOUCH THE MERCURY.  NOW CAREFULLY  
ADD ALCOHOL (RUBBING ALCOHOL OR ANYTHING: DRUG OR GROCERY STORE) TO THE  
MIXTURE AND VOILA!  INSTANT SHOCK BOMB. 
  
I RECCOMEND RIPPING THE TOP OFF OF A COKE CAN AND STUFFING A PAPER TOWEL IN 
TO MAKE IT LESS LIKELY TO BLOW UP WHEN YOU DON'T WANT.  GENTLY TRANSFER THE 
MIXTURE TO THE COKE CAN AND, IF YOU WANT, IT WITH ANOTHER CAN TO  
MAKE IT LOOK MORE INNOCENT. 
NOW PLACE IT SOMEWHERE AND THROW A ROCK AT IT, SHOOT IT WITH A  
WRISTROCKET OR BB GUN AND BOOM! 
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
  
MERCURY FULMINATE #2 
-------------------- 
  
[-1-]   TAKE 5 GRAMS OF PURE MERCURY AND MIX IT WITH 35 ML. OF NITRIC ACID. 
  
[-2-]   THE MIXTURE IS SLOWLY AND GENTLY HEATED.  AS SOON AS THE SOLUTION 
        BUBBLES AND TURNS GREEN, ONE KNOWS THAT THE SILVER MERCURY IS 
        DISSOLVED. 
  
[-3-]   AFTER IT IS DISSOLVED, THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE POURED, SLOWLY, INTO 
        A SMALL FLASK OF ETHYL ALCOHOL.  THIS WILL RESULT IN RED FUMES. 
[-4-]   AFTER A HALF HOUR OR SO, THE RED FUMES WILL TURN WHITE, INDICATING 
        THAT THE PROCESS IS NEARING ITS FINAL STAGE. 
  
[-5-]   AFTER A FEW MINUTES, ADD DISTILLED WATER TO THE SOLUTION. 
[-6-]   THE ENTIRE SOLUTION IS NOW FILTERED, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SMALL 
        WHITE CRYSTALS.  THESE CRYSTALS ARE PURE MERCURY FULMINATE, BUT             SHOULD BE WASHED MANY TIMES, AND TESTED WITH LITMUS PAPER FOR ANY           REMAINING UNDESIRABLE ACID. 
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
  
MERCURY FULMINATE #3 
-------------------- 
  
[-1-]   MIX ONE PART MERCURIC OXIDE WITH TEN PARTS AMMONIA SOLUTION.  WHEN 
        RATIOS ARE DESCRIBED, THEY ARE ALWAYS DONE ACCORDING TO WEIGHT 
        RATHER THAN VOLUME. 
  
[-2-]   AFTER WAITING EIGHT TO TEN DAYS, ONE WILL SEE THAT THE                      MERCURICOXIDE HAS REACTED WITH THE AMMONIA SOLUTION TO PRODUCE THE          WHITE FULMINAVE CRYSTALS. 
  
[-3-]   THESE CRYSTALS MUST BE HANDLED IN THE SAME WAY AS METHOD #2 ABOVE,          IN THAT THEY MUST BE WASHED MANY TIMES AND GIVEN SEVERAL LITMUS             PAPER TESTS.

HOW TO MAKE A HIGH SCHOOL BOMB 
------------------------------ 
  
I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS BUT THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTED A STORY  
ON A CAR BEING TOTALED AND A LADY SUFFERING SERIOUS BURNS ON HER  
TORSO AFTER IT EXPLODED IN HER LAP ON THE 4TH OF JULY.   
ANYWAY THEY REPORTED THE FORMULA USED...  EASY. 
  
ADD CLORINE TO BRAKE FLUID IN A GLASS BOTTLE AND RUN. 
  
DON'T ASK WHY IT'S CALLED A HIGH SCHOOL BOMB, THAT'S JUST  
WHAT FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT CALLED IT. 
  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
  
CONVERTING A SHOTGUN INTO A GERNADE LAUNCHER 
-------------------------------------------- 
  
A 12- OR 16-GAUGE SHOTGUN IS PROPPED UP WITH A SET OF FOLDING LEGS,  
SO AS TO FORM A TRIPOD, WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN BEING THE THIRD  
LEG AT ABOUT A 45- DEGREE ANGLE.  THE ANGLE CAN BE VARIED, FOR AIMING,  
BY MOVING THE LEGS BACK AND FORTH.  TO BUILD A GRENADE LAUNCHER,  
ONE MUST TAKE AN OPEN SHELL AND REMOVE ALL THE SHOT.  ONCE THIS IS DONE,  
REPLACE IT WITH A SMOOTH CYLINDRICAL STICK, WHICH HAS BEEN CUT DOWN  
TO A CLOSE FIT.  WHEN THE SHELL IS LOADED INTO THE GUN, THE STICK  
SHOULD EXTEND OUT THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN.  TO THE EXTENDED RORTION,  
A FLAT RUBBER BASE SHOULD BE FIXED AND A "MOLOTOV COCKTAIL"  
PLACED ON IT.  THIS WILL SEND THE BURNING BOTTLES OVER A HUNDRED  
YARDS WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ACCURACY.   
THIS IS A GOOD WEAPON FOR ENCIRCLEMENT.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
----------------------------------- 
 
A "MOLOTOV COCKTAIL" IS A BOTTLE FILLED WITH A FLAMMABLE LIQUID SUCH AS 
GASOLINE, MIXED WITH OIL OR SOAP POWDER TO THICKEN IT.  A FUSE,  
USUALLY A RAG SOAKED IN GASOLINE, IT ATTACHED TO THE CORK, LIT,  
AND THROWN.  THE BOTTLE BREAKS ON CONTACT WITH ANOTHER HARD OBJECT,  
AND THE GASOLINE IGNITES, CAUSING A BURST OF FLAME.  
THESE WERE USED WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF SUCCESS IN HUNGARY, 
AGAINST THINGS AS BIG AS TANKS.

FORMULAS FOR AMMONIUM NITRATE COMPOUNDS 
--------------------------------------- 
  
HERE ARE FIFTY-SIX FORMULAS FOR AMMONIUM NITRATE COMPOUNDS.   
AMMONIUM NITRATE IS A NEAT EXPLOSIVE THAT CAN BE DETONATED 
WITH ALMOST ANYTHING. 
  
THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR LISTING ALL FIFTY-SIX COMPUNDS.  FIRST, THEY ARE 
ALL DIFFERENT AND, REASONABLY ENOUGH, ALL BLOW DIFFERENTLY (SOME ARE MORE 
POWERFUL, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT TRIED ALL 56).  SOME REQUIRE MORE CARE THAN 
OTHERS TOO.  SECONDLY, YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS FOR ONE, BUT YOU 
MIGHT HAVE ALL YOU NEED FOR THE ANOTHER.

Bommulls krut: 
  
6 liter koncentrerad Salpetersyra 
10 liter koncenterad Svavelsyra. 
  
Blanda under avkylning (blir varmt). 
N„r soppan svalnat l„gg i 5 hekto vanlig bommul (kolla att det 
inte  „r n†got syntetiskt substitut du f†tt tag i och l†t den 
njuta av tillvaron i denna v„tska i ca 15 minuter. Sk”lj sedan 
bomullen under rinnande vatten l„nge och noga. Undvik att hantera 
bomullen med metallf”rem†l under hela processen. L†t sedan 
bomullen torka. FŽRDIGT! 
  
Om receptet „r f”r stort s† kan du byta ut liter mot milliliter 
och d† ta 0.5 gram ist„llet. Kan ju vara lagom att b”rja med! 
  
  
Ett annat bra recept „r att blanda Kaliumpermanganat (KMNO4) och 
finf”rdelat aluminiumpulver, det sm„ller som faan om man tar ca 
s† mycket som rymms i en filmburk..... T„nk inte ens p† att h†lla

och alla ingredienser finns p† v„lsorterade f„rgaff„rer. 
  
Jod k„rve: 
  
L”s Jod (Helst Joddsprit) i Amoniak. 
  
  
Stubintr†d.... 
  
1) L†ngsambrinnande, enkel: L”s vanlig kalisalpeter i vatten och   
   l„gg ner en bomullstr†d i detsamma. Torkas sedan. Brinner       
   l†ngsamt. 
  
2) Snabb, exklusiv modell: L”s bomullskrut i aceton - blir som     
   gele. Blanda i vanligt svartkrut. Appliceras sedan p† typ       
   bomullstr†d. Brinner snabbt och t„nder ex. svartkrut direkt. 
  
En bra variant „r att doppa de sista centimetrarna av den 
l†ngsamma varianten i den snabba.
