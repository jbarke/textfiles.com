   This is the second in a series of articles dealing with the production of
plastic explosives.  This article will cover step by step (SXS?) instructions
on how to make RDX, which is the main ingrediant in the rest of the plastic
explosives I will cover.  The information in this and all of the other articles
dealing with the production of plastic explosives was orignally written by
written by Tim Lewis in a book called,"Kitchen Improvised Plastic Explosives".
I will give the address to send for this and many other books and the end of
this article.

   THE PRODUCTION OF RDX IS VERY DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
DOING.	DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY OF THIS IF YOU WISH TO LIVE TILL YOUR NEXT BIRTHDAY!

   Since the first part of WWII the armed forces of the United States has been
searching for the perfect plastique explosives to be used in demolition work.
This search lead to the development of the 'C' composition plastique
explosives.  Of this group C-4 being the lastest formulation that has been
readily adopted by the armed forces.  This formulation was preceded by C-3,
C-2, and C.  In this series of articles, I will cover all these explosives in
their chronological progression as they were developed and standardized by the
armed forces.  All these explosives are cyclonite or R.D.X.  base with various
plastisizing agents used to achieve the desired product.  This plastisizer,
usually composes 7%-20% of the total weight of the plastique.
Cyclotrimethylenetrinittrime or cyclonite is manufactured in bulk by the
nitration of hexamethylenetetramine, (methenamine, hexamine, etc., etc.) with
strong red 100% nitric acid.  The hardest part of this reaction is obtaining
this red nitric acid.  It will most likely have to be made.  More on this
later.	Hexamine or methenamine can usually be bought in bulk quantities or
hexamine fuel bars for camp stoves can be used but they end up being very
explensive.  To use the fuel bars the need to be powered before hand.  The
hexamine can also be made with common ammonia water (30%) and the commonly
avaliable 36% formaldehyde solution.  To make this componant place 185 grams of
clear ammonia water in a shallow pyrex dish.  To this add 500 ml.  of the
formaldehyde solution to the ammonia water.  Allow this to evaporate and when
the crystals are all that remains in the pan place the pan in the oven on the
lowest heat that the oven has.	This should be done only for a moment or so to
drive off any remaining water.	These crystals are scraped up and placed in a
airtight jar to store them until they are used.  To make the red nitric acid
you will need to buy a retort with a ground glass stopper.  In the retort place
32 grams sulfuric acid, (98%-100%), and to this add 68 grams of potassium
nitrate or 58 grams of sodium nitrate.	Gently heating this retort will
generate a red gas called nitrogen trioxide.  THIS GAS IS HIGHLY POISONOUS AND
THIS STEP, AS WITH ALL OTHER STEPS, SHOULD BE DONE WITH GOOD VENTILATION.  This
nitric acid that is formed will collect in the neck of the retort and form
droplets that will run down the inside of the neck of the retort and should be
caught in a beaker cooled by being surrounded by ice water.

   This should be heated till no more collects in the neck of the retort and
the nitric acid quits dripping out of the neck into the beaker.  This acid
should be stored until enough acid is generated to produce the required size
batch which is determined by the person producing the ecplosive.  Ofcourse the
batch can be larger or smaller but the same rations should be maintained.  To
make R.D.X.  place 550 grams of the nitric acid produced by the above procedure
in a 1000 ml.  beaker in a salted bath.  50 grams of hexamine, (methenamine) is
added in small portions making sure that the temperature of the acid DOES NOT
GO ABOVE 30 DEGREES CELCIUS.  This temperature can be monitored by placing a
thermometer directly in the acid mixture.  During this procedure a vigerous
stirring should be maintained.	If the temperature approches 30 degrees,
IMMEDIATLY STOP THE ADDITION OF THE HEXAMINE until the temperature drops to an
acceptable level.  After the addition is complete continue the stirring and
allow the temperature to drop to 0 degrees celcius and allow it to stay there
for 20 minutes coninuing the vigerous stirring.  After the 20 minutes are up,
pour this acid-hexamine mixture into 1000 ml.  of finely crushed ice and water.
Crystals should form and are filtered out of the liquid.  The crystals that are
filtered out are R.D.X.  and will need to have all traces of the acid removed.
To remove this trace of acid, first wash these crystals by putting them in ice
water and shaking and refiltering.  These crystals are then placed in a little
boiling water and filtered.  Place them in some warm water and check the
acidity for the resultant suspension with litmus paper.  You want it to read
between 6 and 7 on the Ph scale.  If there is still acid in these crystals
reboil them in fresh water until the acid is removed and the litmus paper shows
them between 6 and 7, (the closer to 7 the better).  To be safe these crystals
should be stored water wet until ready for use.  THESE CRYSTALS ARE A VERY HIGH
EXPLOSIVE AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE!	This explosive
is much more powerful than T.N.T.  To use, these will need to be dryed for some
manufaturing processes in the next few articles.  To dry these crystals, place
them in a pan and spread them out and allow the water to evaporate off them
until the are completely dry.  This explosive will detonate in this dry form
when pressed into a mold to a density of 1.55 grams cubed, at a velocity of
8550 M/second!
