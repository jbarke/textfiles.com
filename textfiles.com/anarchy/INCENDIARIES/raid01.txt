**************************************************************************
    The reason I am writing this issue on fuses is because all the files
I've read the explain anything at all about fuses was so fucked up it
was even hard for me to follow ... and because a lot of times the writer
will just say 'insert a fuse' or 'trigger by a shockwave'.. etc. which
makes it extreamly hard for a beginning anarchist to figure it out.. and
for you experienced guyz, maybe this phile will give you some new idea's..
First, it is important.. if you dony already know.. to understand the
different types of explosives.  There are 2 major types, where different
fuses/detonaters apply.

 -------------------------
: High - Order Explosives :
 -------------------------

     A high order explosive has an intense explosion, and generates huge
ammounts of heat.. basically they fuck things up pretty good.  Most high
order explosives are hella sensitive.. someone belching in the next
county could generate a shockwave big enuf to set it off.  There are some
high order's that arent as sensitive to shock waves and heat.. like
plastique.  The millitary uses a squib to set off this type of high order
explosive.  Basically a squib is a detonater.  See 'Squibs' later in this
phile. When the squib is detonated, usually by an electronic detonater,
the small explosion sends a shockwave through the high order, causing it
to explode.  Most of the time, a fuse will not do shit to a high order
explosive, unless it is very sensitive, or has a reactive quality for
flame or heat.

 ------------------------
: Low - Order Explosives :
 ------------------------

     A low order explosive is basically a flammable substance like gun
powder.  This is the most likely type of explosive that will use a fuse.
A low order explosive can also act as a detonater for a high order
explosive, by confining the flash  i.e.  putting a SHIT LOAD of gun powder
into a pipe, and running a fuse through a small hole in the top.  This
will blow the fuck out of most anything... except a building or some
other stupid shit like that... but it is too big to act as a detonater.
To set off a low order explosive, a fuse is used.  A fuse is just a guide
for a flame to come into contact with an explosive substance.  See 'Fuses'
later in this phile.  When lit, the flame will burn down the fuse until
it comes into contact with the material.. ignites it.. and startes the
reaction, until the whole substance is consumed in flame.  Different
fuses have different burn rates, as does gun powder according to its
grade..
          F .. Course powder, burns the slowest  > .50 cal
         FF .. Semi fine powder, burns quite fast> .50 - .38 cal
        FFF .. Fine powder, the fastest          > .38 cal

It was made (which is illegal). This is how someone would go about making

                                   Procedure
                                   .........

1).  Carefully cut the bullet off of the shell with a pair of pliers, but
make sure not to crimp the shell.  Once the bullet is off, pour the
powder into a motar and pestle, or some dish, and grind it up so that it
is a fine powder.  Add some from another bullet, or from a package of
black powder for those black powder guns.  Once the powder is finely
ground, carefully fill the shell about 1/2 way up.  Take a pencil, and
with the eraser, pack the powder into the shell, so that it is 1/2 its
origional size.. or as close as possible.  Add some more, and pack it
down, until the shell is 3/4 filled with densly packed powder.

2).  Take the solar ignighter, and a small knife.  Loosen only a small
amount of the top layer of the powder with the knife.  Bury the head of
the ignighter in the loosened powder, and crimp the very top of the shell
making sure not to dammage the head, but enuf to pack the thing tight.

3).  Solder 2 wires to the 2 wires comming from the ignighter.  Then
CAREFULLY epoxy the crimped .22 shell shut.  If you fuck up the soldering
the thing might go off in youre face... make DAMN sure that the two wires
are not touching, or are not connected by solder.. be CAREFULL!!!

4).  Stick the squib in the High order explosive that you want to detonate
without disturbing the material.  Run the two wirez WAY the hell back
under some cover so that you dont catch some shrapnel in you're face.
Once there, if you have the model rocket launcher, connect the micro clips
(alligatior clips) to the 2 wirez, and press the button.. BOOOOM.  If you
have the improvised battery pack, connect one wire to the (+) terminal,
and one to the (-) terminal... when both are touching they're respective
terminals, BOOOOM !!!!

******************************** Fuses **********************************
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is where creativity comes into play.  There are many ways to make a
fuse.  One of the crudest ways is to make a trail of gasoline, or other
flammable liquid, and light one end.  Here are just a few wayz to make
fuses.

 ------------
: Cigarettes :
 ------------

This is probably the most ingenious way to make a fuse... it works VERY
well, and it can be up to 10-15 minutes delay time.  All that is needed is
a cigarette, and a firecracker fuse.. or similar powder strewn fuse.  See
'Powder Fuses' later in this phile.

                                Procedure
                                .........

1). Very simple.  Just take a large needle, and make a hole somewhere in
the cigarette, but not in the filter... make sure it is in the tobacco.

2). Just insert the fuse through the hole, and light the cigarette.
The fuse, OBVIOUSLY, is connected to the low order explosive.  When the
cigarette burns down to the hole with the fuse, it lights it, and BOOM.


It should look like this:
.........................         ****   <---Lit end
                                  I  I
                                  I  I
                                  I  I
                                  I  I
                                  I  I
                                  I oI   <---Hole
                                  I  I
                                  ----
                                  I&&I   <---Filter
                                  I&&I
                                  ----

Understand?  Good.

 --------------
: Powder Fuses :
 --------------

Powder fuses is a string or a long piece of paper that has been made with
gun powder.  It's the grey string that a firecracker uses.  To make one of
these, you MUST use a 100% all coton shoelace or string.

Materials
.........

100% coton shoelace or string
Fine grade gun powder
Shallow pan or dish
Hot Water


                                    Procedure
                                    .........

1).  Pour powder into pan.  Add small ammounts of the hot water to make a
     Paste.  Smooth the paste.

2).  Spread the paste over the shoelaces.  The paste should be slightly
     runny, but not like water (use you're judgement).

3).  Allow the fuse to dry.

This fuse will have a fast burn rate... to time the fuse, cut a one inch
piece off, and time how long it takes to burn.  Then decide how long of
a fuse will be needed for you're purposes.


 ------------------
: Solar Ignighters :
 ------------------

The easist way to detonate a low order explosive is with a Solor
ignighter.  Simply bury the solor ignighter in the explosive and connect
a model rocket launcher to the two leads comming from the ignighter.
If you dont have a model rocket launcher, simply solder 4 AA batteries
together with wires or brass contacts.  Solder 2 wires to the two leads
from the ignighter, and connect these to the + and - terminals of the
battery pack.  !IMPORTANT!  Only connect the two wires to the terminal
you are ready to detonate the explosive... because as soon as the wires
touch the terminals, the circut will be complete.  To insure detonation,
keep the wires on the terminals for quite a while (at least 30 secs.)
because the ignighter burns for 5 seconds after the circut is complete,
and the detonation may not have been successful in the first 4 seconds of
ignition.

 -------------------------
: 12 Hour Delay/Detonater :
 -------------------------

This can be used for either a Low order or a high order explosive.  This
detonater can be set from 1 hour to 12 hours, by using a 2 handed clock.

Materials
.........

2 Handed 12 hour clock
2 wires
2 contacts
Solar Ignighter / Squib

                                      Procedure
                                      .........

1).  Remove the minute hand from the clock.  If the hour hand can conduct
electricity, solder a wire to this hand.  If the hour hand CANNOT conduct
electricity, solder a wire to one of the contacts, and mount it on the
hand, so that the contact is on the counter clock wise side of the hand.
In other words, glue the contact to the right side of the hand if it was
6 o'clock.  Now mount the second contact that goes to the power source
on the face of the clock in such a way, that when the hand reaches 6
o'clock, both contacts will touch.  If the hand DOES conduct electricity,
you must make this second contact touch the hand when it reachs 6 o'clock.
Solder a wire to the second contact.  This wire should lead to one
terminal of the power source.

2).  Now Connect the first wire to one lead of the solar ignighter, and
the second lead should be connected to one terminal of the power source.
(I know this sounds confusing, but take a look at my diagram while you
read it two or three times over... you should understand it by then, and
if you dont, re read it until you do.)

3).  Now set the clock's hand to how many hours you want it to delay
detonation from 6 o'clock.  Example, if you want it to wait 4 hours, set
the hand at 2 o'clock.  Once that is done the countdown starts.

4).  Bury the head of the solar ignighter in the low order explosive, or
if this procedure is done with a squib, insert the squib in the high order
explosive.  (**NOTE** : To use a squib, substitute the two leads of the
solar ignighter with the 2 leads of the squib.)

5).  Connect the second lead from the solar ignighter/squib to the
power supply (which should always be a 4 AA battery pack when using solar
ignighters or squibs).  Once the battery is connected, the bomb is armed.
CAREFULLY, place the bomb next to whatever you want to blow up, and RUN
LIKE HELL...  you dont want to be there if something goes wrong.  When
the hand reachs 6 o'clock, the contacts will touch, completing the circut,
detonating the explosive.  This is what a pro terrorist would use.
