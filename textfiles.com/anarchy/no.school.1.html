 WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE EXERCISES IN FREE SPEECH I HAVE EVER SE

EN.

IT WAS FIRST PRINTED IN 1968 BY SOME HIGH SCHOOL KIDS IN AMERICA'S

INDUSTRIAL HARTLAND AND MOST RECENTLY (IN ENGLISH AT ANY RATE) IN ENGLAND

AFTER THE RIOTS THERE IN 1982. OF COURSE I REPRINTED IT FOR PURELY

EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES - JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW IRRESOPNSIBLE FREE SPEECH

CAN GET. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO USE

THIS TEXT.

 NOW THAT WE GOT ALL THE BULLSHIT OUT OF THE WAY HERE ARE THE 20 WAYS I'VE

BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT.





1.PUT A ROTTON APPLE OR STALE SANDWICH IN THE TEACHERS DESK.

2.STEAL THE ATTENDANCE BOOK. ADD IN AND RUB OUT TICKS, AND REPLACE OR JUST

BURN IT. SAME GOES FOR UNGUARDED CONDUCT SHEETS OR REPORTS. DON'T MISS

YOUR CHANCE.

3.FILL A SYRINGE (MINUS NEEDLE) WITH MIXED EPOXY & ALCOHOL. YOU NOW HAVE 

30 MINUTES TO FILL LOCKS, ETC., BEFORE THE GLUE HARDENS. YOU CAN ALSO USE

CEMENT, SUPER GLUE OR EVEN BITS OF WOOD, NAILS, ETC.

4.ANOTHER USE OF THE SYRINGE IS TO PRETEND TO SHOOT UP WHEN THE TEACHER IS

WATCHING. EXPLAIN THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE SCHOOL IS SO HORRIBLE

5.PHONE THE SCHOOL AT RANDOM TIMES. TRY FLOOD, FIRE OR BOMB WARNINGS.

DISGUISE YOUR VOICE AND HOLD A HANDKERCHIEF OVER YOUR MOUTH.

6.PRETEND TO HAVE FOOD POISONING. (AFTER LUNCH BREAK) GET LOTS OF PEOPLE

TO JOIN IN. ROLL ON THE FLOOR, OR GET SICK BY PUSHING YOUR FINGERS DOWN YOUR

THROAT. TRY IT IN ASSEMBLY. WITH LUCK YOU CAN START GENERAL PANIC.

7.DRAW OR PAINT SLOGANS ON ROLL DOWN MAPS OR SLIDE SCREENS. OBSCENITIES ARE BES

T

8.HAND OUT NOTICES TO NEW PUPILS TELLING THEM WHICH TEACHERS ARE NASTY & WHY.

9.BAD FOOD? HAVE A GOOD OLD FASHIONED FOOD RIOT.

10.ORGANIZE MASSIVE SEARCHES FOR "LOST" CONTACT LENSES IN GYM CLASS OR

IN HALLWAYS BETWEEN CLASSES. DON'T LET ANYONE WALK THROUGH THE HALL AS THEY

MIGHT STEP ON IT. PRETENDING YOU'VE LOST SOMETHING IS A GOOD COVER FOR ALL

KINDS OF SUBVERSIVE BEHAVIOR.

11.IF YOU STILL HAVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS, TRY WEARING THEM BACK TO FRONT IN

PROTEST. OR DARE BOYS & GIRLS TO WEAR EACH OTHER'S UNIFORMS. IF THIS DOESN'T

WORK, TRY A BLANKET PROTEST.

12.TRY POLITICAL GAMES. SCHOOL IS 12 YEARS BRAINWASHING WITHOUT TRIAL.

SLOWDOWNS, WORK TO RULES, STRIKES AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FUN. BUT DON'T LET

LEADERS OR EGO TRIPPERS SPEAK FOR YOU.

13.GET EVERYONE TO BRING IN ALL THEIR PETS TO SCHOOL TO SHOW THE TEACHER.

14.WRITE DOWN A LIST OF ALL THE STUPID RUBBISH OR RULES YOU HAVE TO LEARN &

HAND IT OUT ON SPORTS DAY OR OPEN DAY.

15.NOW & THEN GET LOADS OF STUDENTS TO RUSH TO THE OFFICE TO GET A RUMOR 

CONFIRMED OR DENIED.

16.MAKE A CITIZENS ARREST ON YOUR WORST TEACHER. DRAG HIM/HER IN FRONT OF

THE CLASS AND PUT HIM/HER ON TRIAL FOR ROTTING THE MINDS OF YOUTH.

17.RIP OFF DISHES AND SILVERWARE FROM THE CAFATERIA, OFFICE EQUIPMENT FROM

THE OFFICE, PAINT ETC. FROM THE ART ROOM, LIGHT BULBS FROM THE SOCKETS,

TOILET PAPER FROM THE JACKS, ETC.,ETC. DONATE THEM TO YOURSELVES OR LOCAL

ANARCHIST GROUP.

18.DURRING LUNCH BREAK TURN ON AND LIGHT ALL GAS TAPS IN THE SCIENCE LAB.

MAKE SURE YOUR NOT CAUGHT AT THIS PRANK & TRY A GOOD DISGUISE.

19.GET EVERYONE TO DEMAND TO SEE THEIR SCHOOL RECORDS FILES, EVERYONE ELSE

(POLICE, SOCIAL WORKERS, ETC.) IS ALLOWED TO SEE THEM.

20.MAKE A FUSE BY STICKING A CIGARETTE BETWEEN THE TWO ROWS IN A MATCH BOOK.

NON-FILTER CIGARETTES ARE GOOD BUT MARLBORO ARE BEST 'CAUSE THEY USE MORE

NITRATE TO MAKE 'EM BURN FASTER. TOSS THE FUSE IN A WASTE BIN, OR ANYWHERE 

WITH LOTS OF BURNABLES. THE OFFICE IS BEST. WAIT 5 MINUTES. CALL ALARM 

YOURSELF TO AVOID ANY "ACCIDENTS." PRACTICE AT HOME FIRST.
