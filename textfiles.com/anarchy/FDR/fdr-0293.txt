 [1.0] INTRO
 ===========
  First of all...  Forget the crap those stupid teachers tell you about soft
  drugs, forget the fagots who tell ya using soft-drugs makes you a junkie!!
  It's the biggest crap I've heard until now!  Soft-drugs are completely
  harmless as long as you use your brains!  Now, read about it...  We got
  alot of info on the Hemp-Faq as well on some other txt-files.  This is a
  collection and some personal notes on Soft-drugs...  Enjoy!

   (1.1) What we're talkin' about...
   ---------------------------------
   In this textfile you will only find info on using/... soft-drugs.  When
   you think you should use hard-drugs, please stop reading this document and
   go waste your life!!  You have a wide range of soft-drugs, and sometimes
   it's hard to tell wether it's hard or soft.  But anyhow, here's a small
   list of soft-drugs I've tried...  Also, I don't like those chemical bull-
   shit-drugs they sell you.  Chemical-shit is for pussies!  I like the
   nature, I only do natural stuff.  It would be wise to stick to this
   principal too.  Mother Nature will never fool you...
           *  Cannabis Sativa : Plain weed/shit/maui/mc/ludery/...
           *  Marihuana       : 'nuff said
           *  Hasj            : 1oo% pure!
           *  ...             : ...

   (1.2) Why would I start using it?
   ---------------------------------
   (1) Well, nobody can ever force you do smoke it!  Never!  However, when
       you're a weak little boy who can't say no at a certain moment...  But
       most of the times, people use it at special occassions, like parties
       x-mas, newyear...

   (2) To proof that your parents are wrong.   Most parents think when you
       smoke a blunt now and then, you're a junkie.  Bullshit, you only turn
       into a junkie when you want to become one!  I'm just a normal guy
       with normal habits, going to a normal school, having normal friends.
       But every now and then, I light a blunt, so what!?

   (3) A better reason to smoke one, is to support the battle towards the
       legalisation of soft-drugs.  For the moment, soft-drugs are still
       forbidden in Belgium...  Support us!  Read on, why you should support
       this battle.


 [2.0] FIGURES AND FACTS!
 ========================
  Enough said on the Intro right there...  Let's start this textfile!  Read
  on and you'll learn alot!

  {2.1}  HISTORY!
  ***************
   (2.1.1) Hemp
   ------------
   For our purposes, hemp is the plant called `cannabis sativa.'  There are
   other plants that are called hemp, but cannabis hemp is the most useful
   of these plants.  In fact, `cannabis sativa' means `useful (sativa)
   hemp (cannabis)'.  `Hemp' is any durable plant that has been used since
   pre-history for many purposes.  Fiber is the most well known product, and
   the word `hemp' can mean the rope or twine which is made from the hemp
   plant, as well as just the stalk of the plant which produced it.

   (2.1.2) Cannabis
   ----------------
   Cannabis is the most durable of the hemp plants, and it produces the
   toughest cloth, called `canvass.'  (Canvass was widely used as sails in
   the early shipping industry, as it was the only cloth which would not rot
   on contact with sea spray.)  The cannabis plant also produces three other
   very important products which the other hemp plants do not (in usable
   form, that is): seed, pulp, and medicine.  The pulp is used as fuel, and
   to make paper.  The seed is suitable for both human and animal foods.  The
   oil from the seed can be used in as a base for paints and varnishes.  The
   medicine is a tincture or admixture of the sticky resin in the blossoms
   and leaves of the hemp plant, and is used for a variety of purposes.

   (2.1.3) Marijuana
   -----------------
   The word `marijuana' is a Mexican slang term which became popular in the
   late 1930's in America, during a series of media and government programs
   which we now refer to as the `Reefer Madness Movement.'  It refers
   specifically to the medicine part of cannabis, which Mexican soldiers used
   to smoke.  Today in the U.S., hemp (meaning the roots, stalk, and stems of
   the cannabis plant) is legal to possess.  No one can arrest you for
   wearing a hemp shirt, or using hemp paper.  Marijuana (The flowers, buds
   or leaves of the cannabis plant) is not legal to possess, and there are
   stiff fines and possible jail terms for having any marijuana in your
   possession.  The seeds are legal to possess and eat, but only if they are
   sterilized (will not grow to maturity.)   Since it is not possible to grow
   the hemp plant without being in possession of marijuana, the United States
   does not produce any industrial hemp products, and must import them or
   more often, substitute others.  (There is a way to grow hemp legally, but
   it involves filing an application with the Drug Enforcement Administration
   and the DEA very rarely ever gives its permission.)  This does not seem
   to have stopped people from producing and using marijuana, though.  In
   many of the United States, marijuana is the number one cash crop, mostly
   because it fetches a very high price on the black market.

  {2.2} OTHER USES FOR HEMP...
  ****************************
   (2.2.1) Food
   ------------
   Hemp seed is a highly nutritious source of protein and essential fatty
   oils.  Many populations have grown hemp for its seed -- most of them eat it
   as `gruel' which is a lot like oatmeal.  The leaves can be used as
   roughage, but not without slight psycho-active side-effects.  Hemp seeds
   do not contain any marijuana and they do not get you `high.'  Hemp seed
   protein closely resembles protein as it is found in the human blood.  It
   is fantastically easy to digest, and many patients who have trouble
   digesting food are given hemp seed by their doctors.  Hemp seed was once
   called `edestine'  and was used by scientists as the model for vegetable
   protein.  Hemp seed oil provides the human body with essential fatty acids.
   Hemp seed is the only seed which contains these oils with almost no
   saturated fat.  As a supplement to the diet, these oils can reduce the
   risk of heart disease.  It is because of these oils that birds will live
   much longer if they eat hemp seed.  With hemp seed, a vegan or vegetarian
   can survive and eat virtually no saturated fats.  One handful of hemp
   seed per day will supply adequate protein and essential oils for an adult.
   Hemp requires little fertilizer, and grows well almost everywhere.  It
   also resists pests, so it uses little pesticides.  Hemp puts down deep
   roots, which is good for the soil, and when the leaves drop off the hemp
   plant, minerals and nitrogen are returned to the soil.  Hemp has been grown
   on the same soil for twenty years in a row without any noticeable depletion
   of the soil.  Using less fertilizer and agricultural chemicals is good for
   two reasons.  First, it costs less and requires less effort.  Second, many
   agricultural chemicals are dangerous and contaminate the environment -- the
   less we have to use, the better.
   Hemp does not produce quite as much protein as soy, but hemp seed protein
   is of a higher quality than soy.  Agricultural considerations may make
   hemp the food crop of the future.  In addition to the fact that hemp is an
   easy crop to grow, it also resists UV-B light, which is a kind of sunlight
   blocked by the ozone layer.  Soy beans do not take UV-B light very well.
   If the ozone layer were to deplete by 16%, which by some estimates is very
   possible, soy production would fall by 25-30%.  We may have to grow hemp or
   starve -- and it won't be the first time that this has happened.  Hemp has
   been used to `bail out' many populations in time of famine. Unfortunately
   because of various political factors, starving people in today's
   underdeveloped countries are not taking advantage of this crop.  In some
   places, this is because government officials would call it `marijuana' and
   pull up the crop.  In other countries, it is because the farmers are busy
   growing coca and poppies to produce cocaine and heroin for the local Drug
   Lord.  This is truly a sad state of affairs.  Hopefully someday the Peace
   Corps will be able to teach modern hemp seed farming techniques and end the
   world's protein shortage.

   (2.2.2) Cloth
   -------------
   The stalk of the hemp plant has two parts, called the bast and the hurd.
   The fiber (bast) of the hemp plant can be woven into almost any kind of
   cloth.  It is very durable.  In fact, the first Levi's blue jeans were
   made out of hemp for just this reason.  Compared to all the other natural
   fibers available, hemp is more suitable for a large number of applications.
   Here is how hemp is harvested for fiber: A field of closely spaced hemp is
   allowed to grow until the leaves fall off.  The hemp is then cut down and
   it lies in the field for some time washed by the rain.  It is turned over
   once to expose both sides of the stalk evenly.  During this time, the hurd
   softens up and many minerals are returned to the soil.  This is called
   `retting,' and after this step is complete, the stalks are brought to
   a machine which separates the bast and the hurd.  We are lucky to have
   machines today -- men used to do this last part by hand with hours of
   back-breaking labor.  The cloth that hemp makes may be a little less soft
   than cotton, (though there are also special kinds of hemp, or ways to grow
   or treat hemp, that can produce a soft cloth) but it is much stronger and
   longer lasting. (It does not stretch out.)  Environmentally, hemp is a
   better crop to grow than cotton, especially because we have to use *alot*
   of fertilizers to grow cotton.  Cotton is a soil damaging crop and needs
   a lot of fertilizer.  :-(

   (2.2.3) Paper
   -------------
   Both the fiber (bast) and pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be used to
   make paper.  Fiber paper was the first kind of paper, and the first batch
   was made out of hemp in ancient China.  Fiber paper is thin, tough,
   brittle, and a bit rough.  Pulp paper is not as strong as fiber paper, but
   it is easier to make, softer, thicker, and preferable for most everyday
   purposes.  The paper we use most today is a `chemical pulp' paper made
   from trees.  Hemp pulp paper can be made without chemicals from the hemp
   hurd.  Most hemp paper made today uses the entire hemp stalk, bast and hurd.
   High-strength fiber paper can be made from the hemp baste, also without
   chemicals.  The problem with today's paper is that so many chemicals are
   used to make it.  High strength acids are needed to make quality (smooth
   strong, and white) paper out of trees.  These acids produce chemicals which
   are very dangerous to the environment.  Paper companies do their best to
   clean these chemicals up (we hope.)  Hemp offers us an opportunity to make
   affordable and environmentally safe paper for all of our needs, since it
   does not need much chemical treatment.  It is up to consumers, though, to
   make the right choice -- these dangerous chemicals can also be used on
   hemp to make a slightly more attractive product.  Instead of buying the
   whiter, brighter role of toilet paper, we will need to think about what we
   are doing to the planet.  Because of the chemicals in today's paper, it
   will turn yellow and fall apart as acids eat away at the pulp.  This takes
   several decades, but because of this publishers, libraries and archives
   have to order specially processed acid free paper, which is much more
   expensive, in order to keep records.  Paper made naturally from hemp is
   acid free and will last for centuries.

   (2.2.4) Fuel
   ------------
   The pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be burned as is or processed into
   charcoal, methanol, methane, or gasoline.  The process for doing this is
   called destructive distillation, or `pyrolysis.'  Fuels made out of plants
   like this are called `biomass' fuels.  This charcoal may be burned in
   today's coal-powered electric generators.  Methanol makes a good automobile
   fuel, in fact it is used in professional automobile races.  It may someday
   replace gasoline.  Hemp may also be used to produce ethanol (grain
   alcohol.)  The United States government has developed a way to make this
   automobile fuel additive from cellulosic biomass.  Hemp is an excellent
   source of high quality cellulosic biomass.  One other way to use hemp as
   fuel is to use the oil from the hemp seed -- some diesel engines can run
   on pure pressed hemp seed oil.  However, the oil is more useful for other
   purposes, even if we could produce and press enough hemp seed to power
   many millions of cars.

   (2.2.5) Medicins
   ----------------
   Marijuana has thousands of possible uses in medicine.  Marijuana (actually
   cannabis extract) was available as a medicine legally in this country
   until 1937, and was sold as a nerve tonic -- but mankind has been using
   cannabis medicines much longer than that.  Marijuana appears in almost
   every known book of medicine written by ancient scholars and wise men.  It
   is usually ranked among the top medicines, called `panaceas', a word which
   means `cure-all'.  The list of diseases which cannabis can be used for
   includes: multiple sclerosis, cancer treatment, AIDS (and AIDS treatment)
   glaucoma, depression, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, pruritis
   sclerodoma, severe pain, and dystonia.  This list does not even consider
   the other medicines which can be made out of marijuana -- these are just
   some of the illnesses for which people smoke or eat whole marijuana today.
   There are over 60 chemicals in marijuana which may have medical uses.  It
   is relatively easy to extract these into food or beverage, or into some
   sort of lotion, using butter, fat, oil, or alcohol.  One chemical
   cannabinol, may be useful to help people who cannot sleep.  Another is
   taken from premature buds and is called cannabidiolic acid.  It is a
   powerful disinfectant.  Marijuana dissolved in rubbing alcohol helps people
   with the skin disease herpes control their sores, and a salve like this
   was one of the earliest medical uses for cannabis.  The leaves were once
   used in bandages and a relaxing non-psychoactive herbal tea can be made
   from small cannabis stems.  The most well known use of marijuana today is
   to control nausea and vomiting.  One of the most important things when
   treating cancer with chemotherapy or when treating AIDS with AZT or
   Foscavir, being able to eat well, makes the difference between life or
   death.  Patients have found marijuana to be extremely effective in fighting
   nausea; in fact so many patients use it for this purpose even though it is
   illegal that they have formed `buyers clubs' to help them find a steady
   supply.  In California, some city governments have decided to look the
   other way and allow these clubs to operate openly.
   Marijuana is also useful for fighting two other very serious and wide
   spread disabilities.  Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness
   caused by uncontrollable eye pressure.  Marijuana can control the eye
   pressure and keep glaucoma from causing blindness.  Multiple Sclerosis is
   a disease where the body's immune system attacks nerve cells.  Spasms and
   many other problems result from this.  Marijuana not only helps stop these
   spasms, but it may also keep multiple sclerosis from getting worse.


 [3.0] REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES
 ===========================
   (3.1) Rolling a joint
   ---------------------
   You have different ways to roll a joint.  The first one is the Europian
   style, the second way to do it is the American way.  I suggest you use the
   American way if you want to get high real fast or the Europian way if you
   have alot of marihuana.
     ->  Europian way:   Tobbaco, Marihuana, Cigarette-papers (or a cigar)
          *  Break up a cigar and fill it first with Tobbaco.  Spread the
             tobbaco and roll it.  Now, spread the Marihuana over your
             tobbaco.  !Mind; do not put Maui at the beginning of the cigar!
             It's just a waste, since you're not gonna smoke it.  Now, roll
             the cigar again and put it back together (tongue).  When you
             don't have a cigar, but cigarette-papers instead.  You take two
             papers and place first one a bit crossed over the second one.
             Here's a drawing;

                    --------.------.          Now, do the same as with the
                   |         \      \         cigar.  Then, light it, smoke
                   :    1     \  2    \       it and pass it...  Have phun!
                   |           \_______\
                    -----------' 

     ->  American way:   Marihuana, Cigarette-papers (or a cigar)
          *  Same as the above, but don't use the Tobbaco.  Just use the 100%
             pure Marihuana.  it'I cost alot, but it takes you alot faster to
             your dreams...

   (3.2) Overdose?
   ---------------
   You simply can't overdose on Marihuana, Weed or Hasj.  It's impossible.
   I've smoked 12 blunts (american way) on one night all by myself...  I
   didn't overdose. However, I was 'too-stoned'.  Weed makes you either
   more active or more lazy.  It's a drug that strongens your feelings.  So
   when you're happy, you'll be delighted.  When you're sad, you'll be really
   depressed.

   (3.3) Going berserk!!
   ---------------------
   Marijuana does not `cause' psychosis.  Psychotic people can smoke
   marijuana and have an episode, but there is nothing in marijuana that
   actually initiates or increases these episodes.  Of course, if any
   mentally ill person is given marijuana for the first time or without their
   knowledge, they might get scared and `freak.'  Persons who suffer from
   severe psychological disorders often use marijuana as a way of coping.
   Because of this, some researchers have assumed that marijuana is the
   cause of these problems, when it is actually a symptom.  If you have heard
   that marijuana makes people go crazy, this is probably why.  So, chill out
   you ain't gonna walk like a madman on the streets of your town.  Just blow
   my friend, just blow...

   (3.4) Scared for the hard-side...
   ---------------------------------
   Smoking Marihuana does not turn you into a hard-drug junkie.  You still
   have total control over your mind and body.  When you go on hard-drugs, it
   is not the fault of that joint you smoked last day, but of the weakness of
   your own!  Stepping-Stone-Theory really sucks on this one!  This theory
   indicates that a soft-drug user is going to do hard-drugs anyhow.  Not true
   If every soft-drug-user would become addicted to hard-drugs, I'd be on
   crack/hero‹ne and coca‹ne all the same time now!  :)

   (3.5) Shit, I forgot :)
   -----------------------
   The effect of marijuana on memory is its most dramatic and the easiest to
   notice.  Many inexperienced marijuana users find that they have very
   strange, sudden and unexpected memory lapses.  These usually take the form
   of completely forgetting what you were talking about when you were right in
   the middle of saying something important.   However, these symptoms only
   occur while a person is `high'.   They do not carry over or become
   permanent, and examinations of extremely heavy users has not shown any
   memory or thinking problems.  More experienced marijuana users seem to be
   able to remember about as well as they do when they are not `high.'
   Studies which have claimed to show short-term memory impairment have not
   stood up to scrutiny and have not been duplicated.  Newer studies show that
   marijuana does not impair simple, real-world memory processes.  Marijuana
   does slow reaction time slightly, and this effect has sometimes been
   misconstrued as a memory problem.  To put things in perspective, one group
   of researchers made a control group hold their breath, like marijuana
   smokers do.  Marijuana itself only produced about twice as many effects
   on test scores as breath holding.  Many people use marijuana to study.
   Other people cannot, for some reason, use marijuana and do anything that
   involves deep thought.  Nobody knows what makes the difference.

   (3.6) Forgetting the pain
   -------------------------
   As said before, smoking a blunt makes some pain go away.  But it'll come
   back too.  So it's not a real substitute!  Please visit a doctor when you
   feel some bad pain, after all, the pain you feel may get worse and even
   that worse ONE blunt will not do it anymore...


 [4.0] SOFT-DRUGS AND THE SYSTEM
 ================================
  Sooner or later, any drug-user will be confronted with cops, security, ...
  Here's what to do in case of ...

   (4.1) A police-action
   ---------------------
   You're happily dancing on the dance-floor, while while the smoke of your
   blunt is still in yar head.  Sudden, police comes in...  Dogs!  Quickly
   you remove the stash in your pocket and throw it on the ground while no
   one sees it...  Voila, shit is gone!  Before going in, check on dogs!  Let
   one friend pass the security and let him check out the place really care-
   ful.  Also, pretend you're a nosy guy and ask all stuff about the security.
   And...  DON'T BLOW WHILE YOU'RE STILL AT THE PARTY...  <stupid>

   (4.1) A simple drugtest
   -----------------------
   Obviously, your best bet is to be drug free at the time of the test.  I
   would recommend two months of drug abstinence before the drug test.  Drug
   retention periods are as follows:
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        Compound                       Approx. Retention
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        Amphetamines                   20-25 days
        Barbituates                    10-14 days
        Cocaine                        2-4 days
        Ethyl Alcohol                  1-2 days
        LSD                            20-40 days
   ->>  Marijuana                      14-30 days          <<-
        Methaqualone                   14-21 days
        Opiates                        10-14 days
        Phenocyclidine (PCP)           10-14 days
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   To protect themselves from lawsuits, testers will ask you to sign a
   urinalysis consent form.  It will ask you to list the drugs you've taken in
   the past week.  Cross out the word "week" and write in "month."  If the
   supervisor screams at you, just tell him you read an article that said an
   over-the-counter drug you took for the flu three weeks ago could show up.
   Now for the drugs.  For almost every illegal drug there is an OTC drug that
   tests positive.  Here is a list of cross-reacting drugs that you should
   list on the consent form:
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        Drug/Metabolite              Cross-Reactive
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        Amphetetamine                OTC cold medicines, such as Nyquil,
                                     Vicks Nasal Spray, Sudafed, Neosynephren
                                     etc.
        Barbiturate                  Rarely prescribed compounds... you're
                                     hosed
        Cannaboids                   Ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, Mydol)
        Cocaine                      Amoxicillin (unconfirmed)
        Methaqualone                 None reported to date
        Morphine                     Codeine (in any prescription form)
                                     Poppy seeds
        Doxylamine                   OTC antihistamines and sleeping pills
        Phencyclidine (PCP)          Dextromethororphan (found in some
                                     prescription cough medicines)
                                     Diazepam (Valium)
        LSD                          None reported to date
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   Learn what test is being used.  There are three that are quite common.  The
   EMIT, Abuscreen (RIA), and ToxiLab (TLC).  If you find out that they are
   doing Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry (GC/MS), then you are totally
   screwed.  The GC/MS is the chemical equivalent of finding a needle in a
   haystack.  It finds EVERYTHING and is IMPOSSIBLE to cheat on.  Fortunately
   GC/MS is VERY expensive, and it is only used for confirmation tests.
   Don't worry about it.
   The EMIT test does NOT scan for LSD, RIA does.  If you use ethyl alcohol
   or barbituates, RIA does not scan for them, but EMIT does.  Also, nothing
   currently scans for Ecstasy, Psylocybin, mescaline, or nicotine.  If you
   are in the military, you are going to be tested with RIA.  The majority of
   federal agencies screen with EMIT.  Private sector companies split between
   EMIT and TLC.  No problem.... all are about equally beatable.

   (4.3) Bypassing a drugtest
   --------------------------
   Something like 5% of the public finds it impossible to urinate with
   somebody nearby.  More find it difficult to void under direct observation.
   It's a documented medical condition, known as "blushing kidneys."  Although
   a minority are afflicted, who is to say you're not one of them?  A doctor's
   note or plaintive insistence of "Please, I can't do it if you're watching "
   will do wonders for insuring privacy.   Be creative when you're in the
   bathroom.  Use your body to disrupt line-of-sight observance.  Hand
   placement can conceal a lot of activity, but block with anything else
   that's available.  Males might say they only urinate sitting down.  Like
   a good magician, distract the observer.  Ask them to run the faucet; say
   that the sound of running water coaxes your own activity.  Practice
   practice, practice!  Observers, though they may not show it, are
   embarrassed as you are.  The longer you take to urinate, the longer the
   line behind you grows.  Apply enough pressure and they'll give you the
   latitude you need to perform your little alchemy.  Why all the contortion?
   Because you want to make some subtle substitutions replacing your urine
   with clean stuff.
   Assume a temperature reading will be taken from the specimen.  Don't swap
   an ice-cold brew for tepid pee.  The standard temperature that they're
   looking for is between 90.5 and 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Getting pure
   urine is the first step to making an effective substitution.  Know your
   source.  A relative, a minister, an infant, anyone that can be counted on
   for "clean" urine should be tapped.  The sample should be as fresh as
   possible.  If you need to keep it a few days before the switcheroo, stick
   it in the refrigerator.  After a two month period of drug abstinence, you
   can make your own samples galore and freeze them indefinitely in plastic
   baggies until needed.   WARNING!!  Do not substitute animal urine, or make
   urine from food coloring and water.  They are easily detected.
   The substitute urine is clean and warm.  Now you need a device to get it
   into the bathroom.  At a pharmacy, purchase a Bard Dispoz-a-Bag Drainage
   Bag or other similar product made for temporary use by ambulant patients.
   Cost, under $4.00.  They come in different sizes.  In our trials, the large
   leg bag worked best because the extra volume and shape allowed for a
   flatter distribution along the midsection where you'll be wearing it.  It
   has a short tube and cap, but you can add a short piece of rubber tubing
   and a valve for easy filling.

   When a test is imminent, fill and seal the bag with clean urine.  Squeeze
   all of the air out, seal, and put it on - remembering that it can't
   withstand more than eighteen hours at room temperature.  So if the test
   doesn't go down, take the bag home and put it back in the fridge or freezer.
   You can repeat this as many times as needed.  Here's the correct procedure
   for concealing the bag.  Pull down your skirt or pants.  Secure the bag to
   your abdomen, exposing as much of the latex to your skin as possible.  The
   more surface area taken up, the flatter the bag will lie, and the better
   concealed it will be.  Using the abdomen, not the leg, will let gravity do
   its thing.  Tape it in place.  If you don't want to tape it to your body
   it might rest easy if you wear panties or jockey shorts.  Women shouldn't
   push it inside panty hose because when you take them off to pee, it'll
   fall out, unless you cut a pee hole for the hose.  You can also purchase
   incontinence pants for about ten dollars.  These give a firm fit
   additional warmth, and need no tape.  If you need, buy a spool of surgical
   tape.  Now, snake the output tube from the bag to your crotch.  The tube and
   the on/off cap should be within easy reach, but hidden from sight.  It
   should also feel comfortable - strange at first, but comfortable.  After a
   few hours, you'll forget about it.  When the time comes for you to "urinate"
   discreetly reach into your clothing, locate and turn on the release valve
   or take off the cap.  The "clean" urine will empty into the jar, apparently
   your own product.  When the bag is empty, or you feel you have given
   enough, turn off the supply, zip up, shake your read end, and smile.  A
   few drops on your shoe or the seat adds a measure of authenticity.
   This method works well for two reasons.  First, urine observers are on the
   outlook for bulk - glass jars, things concealed in pockets, and so forth.
   While someone will occasionally ask you to remove a coat, frisks and strip
   searches are forbidden.  And someone would have to get awfully close to
   see the small hose at work.  Men standing with their backs to the observers
   and women sitting with their skirts up are shields enough.  The drainage
   bag is form-fitting, especially when taped flat.  No one but you knows it's
   there.  Second, your abdomen serves as a heating pad, radiating body warmth
   directly to the sample.  In an hour the bag will be near enough to body
   temperature.  

   As good as the bag trick is, it may not be right for everyone.  A good
   variation.  Purchase a few reservoir-tipped condoms (non-lubricated
   please).  Fill one, pull a second over it (to prevent bursts), and tape it
   as close to your crotch as possible.  When the time comes to urinate, with
   a presharpened fingernail, puncture the reservoir tip, and go with the
   flow.

   Women have an anatomical advantage, the option of inserting a urine-filled
   condom within the vagina.  Again, use sharpened fingernails or a concealed
   pin to get things flowing.  Even at extra-close range, it's virtually
   impossible to tell the source of the yellow stream.  These techniques
   should be tried and perfected at home.  Novices should use water in their
   dry runs.  This should get you out of trouble...


 [5.0] STARTING OUT TO DEAL
 ==========================
  You'll need some money soon and since we are not gonna steal or work for
  it, we'll find another way...  called dealing.  Dealing drugs is a federal
  offence too, but we don't give a shit!

   (5.1) Picking the market
   ------------------------
   First, be sure what you're doing!  If you stay at a school where 90% of
   the students are pussies and wimps, don't even think about starting to
   deal.  But when the most of the guys you live with have done their time in
   prison, you may say you have a good market...  Then, tell your closest
   friend in that school that whenever he need some drugs, he may contact
   you.  Sooner or later, this guys (who is your friend) will have told that
   to his friends and their friends tell to ...   Like that, you keep your
   market small. :)

   (5.2) Taking an order
   ---------------------
   When a guy steps up to you and he looks like a real gentleman, nice
   dressed and shit like that, don't tell you deal drugs.  Just tell 'em he
   is a super-idiot to believe you deal drugs...  Why you do this?  Because
   that guy could be a fucking cop!  When some other kiddo steps up to you
   and you see he has been blowing for years, it's okay to trust him.  Note
   down his name and quantity/quality of weed he wants, tell him the pickup
   date and place and leave...  Don't stay for a chat, just doing stricktly
   business.

   (5.3) Doing the delivery
   ------------------------
   This is prolly the most difficult.  There you are with all plastic baggies
   of weed on you, if you should fall, all the weed is on the floor, ...  You
   start to scare yourself and ...  I'll shut up.  Now *this* is a bad example
   in which situation you get on the street.  Just relax, cool down, perhaps
   have a blow before you do the delivery.  When a cop comes into your
   direction (but he isn't suspiciously looking at you), just say a nice 'hi'
   to him.  The man will be pleased that youth isn't all rotten after all :))
   Instead if the cop is *really* interested in you and you suspect he might
   be tipped, cross the street and carefully watch the cop.  If he is also
   crossing the street, you may tell he's onto you.  Then, don't panic and
   get in to the closest shopping-center (Nopri, Unic, Delhaize) you can.
   Once you're in, go between the rakes and make a run for it...  If you think
   you can't escape the shop, hide your stash somewhere on a safe place where
   nobody will find it.  Then, simply purchase some candy and go out...  The
   cop will probably be all over you, but don't bother him, just deny every-
   thing he says...

   (5.4) Handing over...
   ---------------------
   This is tricky too.  This is a matter of trust.  First, always ask your
   money first!!  Never trust the guy you're faced with, but you should come
   over trustworthy...  Now, when you have the money, stand a bit closer to
   each-other and make the trade...  Tell him to open his pocket of his
   jacket and deposit the stuff in it that way no one can see what you're
   doing!  When the guy is making a problem with you, just leave as fast a
   possible because it is unnecesarry to atract the attention of everybody
   around you...


 [6.0] GROWING YOUR OWN POT
 ==========================
  If you're gonna deal, you should at least be able to grown your own pot or
  get a trustworthy and low-priced dealer.  Here's (again) how;

   (6.1) Finding a dealer
   ----------------------
   Okay, you know this dealer.  Then step up to him and ask some prices...
   If you think you can easily add another 100bef every few grams, it's okay.
   The junks will pay you, if the prices are really high you can either find
   yourself another Dealer or discuss the prices.  Ask him if you can speak
   him privatly and tell him what you're planning to do.  Maybe, you can work
   for him (couriering), but I don't know much about it so I won't give
   advice...  My only advice is, that's it's dangerous to deal to people you
   have never seen before.  Also, be sure *what* you're dealing...  Don't do
   any hard-drugs, because then you're in the middle of a web which you can't
   escape!

   (6.2) Growing your own stash
   -----------------------------
   Until the early 1980's most indoor growers used fluorescent lights to
   illuminate their garden.  These tubes have tremendous advantages over
   incandescents.  They emit about 3 times as much light as an incandescent
   (given the same wattage), and the light spectrum is one that plants con
   use more effectively.  However, they do certainly have their limitations.
   Light is emitted over a large area, so it is not concentrated.  Because of
   this, the lights have to be hung very close to the plants, and constantly
   moved to accommodate plant growth.  This makes garden maintenance rather
   difficult.  Florescents are, however, very useful in cloning, and starting
   seedlings.  Because in these stages, a plant is not growing vertically very
   quickly, the disadvantages of moving the lights are reduced.  They also
   put out a more gentle light than the HID lamps, and release less heat.
   If you choose to use fluorescents, it is best to purchase the 'cool white'
   variety.   The ones that are sold as grow lamps (including grow-lux,
   vitalite, etc.) are much less efficient than a standard fluorescent, and
   just do not put out enough light to be useful.  The slightly different
   spectrum produced by these lamps does nothing for most plants.

   High intensity discharge lamps are easier to use, and more efficient.  Low
   wattage HIDs are sometimes sold for household outdoor use.  Large Wattage
   lamps are used for lighting streets, parking lots, stadiums and other large
   areas.  They come in two basic flavors:
         *   METAL HALIDES or MH lamps emit a white light that looks slightly
             bluish.  They are used to light stadiums, convention centers,
             gymnasiums, and other large areas where a natural looking light
             is desired.

         *   HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM or HPS lamps emit a pink or amber light.
             They are used for lighting parking lots and other areas where
             the color of the light is not important.  HPS units are much
             more efficient than MH ones, producing more light and less heat
             per watt of energy consumed.  They are often used alone with no
             detrimental effect on the plants, and will promote faster plant
             growth than MH lamps during both vegetative growth and flowering.
             Combinations of bulbs are _NOT_ required, as the HPS lamp does
             produce all of the light spectrums necessary for healthy growth.

   MH lamps are available in 175,200, 400 and 1000 watt sizes.  HPS lamps come
   in 50, 75, 150, 400 and 1000 watt sizes.  Each lamp requires its own
   ballast, which comes with the fixtures that are designed to use these lamps
   and are also available separately.
   The following chart shows how much light each lamp emits, and the area
   that it covers adequately:

        MH 400W                         40,000                  12-20
        HPS 70W                          7,600                  3-6
        HPS 150W                        16,000                  6-11
        HPS 400W                        50,000                  15-30

   Gardens should receive 1000-3000 lumens per square foot.  Successful
   gardens usually are lit at around 2,000 lumens per square foot.  During the
   vegetative stage, plants stretch out when they receive low levels of light.
   During flowering, the flowers are looser and sparse.

   A quick warning:  At least in the US, there are large government agencies
   whose only purpose is to eliminate the growth of marijuana.   Although
   purchasing a high powered lighting system does not mean that you will be
   growing pot (and many people grow other things artificially),  it is still
   not a really good idea to link your name with the purchase of one of these
   lamps (especially the larger ones).  Go into the store knowing exactly what
   you want, pay for it in cash,  and do not give them your name (or give them
   a false one if they even ask).  Most lighting distributors will not ask any
   questions.


 [7.0] OTHER ADVICE
 ------------------
  Here's some other stuff I wasn't able to drop in, in other sections of this
  file.  Read for pure fun, hell we already were reading for pure fun... :)

  We also give other names to weed because it would look very stupid if we'd
  go and shout to each other on the other side of the street like 'Hey, Mike
  I've received my new stash of weed this morning, pretty cool huh?!'...  Well
  I know, you and Mike will be gona for a while... :)  So, get yourself a
  word that some people know as a synonym for weed.  Like MAUI, LUDERY, MC
  A BIG FAT ONE, WOWIE, STICKIE, SHIT, ...
  
  Don't ask everyone to go blowing with you, only do it with your closest
  friends.  It's more fun and it's safer that way.
  
  Give your girlfriend a real *huge* American Joint...  Big hint!  You can
  mostly do anything YOU (and SHE) want!  Hell, you may even fuck her in
  public...  <goodie>  Let's try it...
  
  When blowing with other people, don't tell 'em who you are.  If they laugh
  at you, make up some fake name...

  When dealing to someone, DON'T keep the notes you have taken togehter with
  your stash.  If the cops bust you, they bust the other guys you're dealing
  with too!  NOTE; This has actually happened here in Tielt, some guy was
  busted by the cops while he was having 50.000Bef in his pockets together
  with a list of all the names he dealed to.  Thank god, I have never asked
  him to supply me!

  Most of it comes down to feeling...  You mostly feel it if you can trust
  someone or not...

  You can order Cannabis-Sativa-made baseball-caps at Wave Magazine.  Or
  you can order Cannabis-tshirts at Large Popmerchandising.  Also go out and
  buy Cypress Hill and Ice-T CD's...  They help these folks who come up for
  the legalisation of Marihuana.  These guys are cool, so why not help 'em??
