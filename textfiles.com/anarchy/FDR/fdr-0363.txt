   This file will document the procedure to produce small .177 caliber
cartridges that will fire a cloud of pepper defense spray, for use by
individuals interested in carrying a form of defense, but object to carrying
true firearms or weapons that are capable of serious injury.
   All processes described in this file are for informational purposes. If
the reader takes the responsability to manufacture the products described 
here, it is the readers own decision, and the author of this file will take
no responsibility for any injuries or punishments levied on the reader of
this file or anyone that is injured by any procedure or product described
within this file.

>>>Intro<<<   
^^^^^^^^^^^
   Now that the disclaimer is over with, we can get down to business. You
may ask why you'd want to make these Tear-Gas Cartridges (TGCs). Well, if
you're like me, you know you need some form of protection in today's world,
but you really don't want to carry a real gun, or even a pellet gun, since
most of todays pellet guns are very powerful and can even be lethal.
   Well, now, if you have a pellet gun, you can make harm-less TGCs for it,
and give yourself the protection you want, and the piece of mind you need.


>>>Materials<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Ok. This is just a list of the things you'll need to complete this
project. You'll want to have all of these materials before you start.

Materials--

1) Extendable metal antenna similar to Radio Shack #270-1413
1) Can of pepper gas, or a reasonable amount of homemade pepper irritant
1 or 2) Plastic sandwich bags

Equipment--

1) Pipe cutter
1) X-atco blade
1) Length of wire with a small bend at the end
1) Pair of goggles
1) Respirator (optional, but recommended)
1) Pair latex rubber gloves

>>>Prep<<<
^^^^^^^^^^
   Ok. Now you need to find which section of the antenna fits your gun. Just
cut off the little cylindrical dealie at the end and try each section. When
you've found the section that fits your gun, cut off all the other pieces
and get rid of them or somehting. Now, using the pipe cutter, cut the section 
that is the size of your gun (.177) into a bunch of smaller sections that 
are each the length of a pellet. You should have 8 or 10, and you'll want 
at least 6 (2 for test firing, and 4 to use).
   Also, take the sandwich bag(s) and cut it into small (about 1 inch square) 
pieces of plastic. This is vital. You must not cut the excesivly large, 
or insufficiently small. It may take some practice to find the right size. 
That's why you use water to test fire. 
This should be the last step of the prep for making the actual cartridges. 
You should definately be OUTSIDE to do this part. Take some sort of 
container that you know will not cause much splash. 
I suggest using some sort of tall beaker. Anyway, go outside with your 
gloves, goggles and respirator on, and spray some of your irritant into 
the container. If you chose to use homemade irritant, you have an advantage 
here. Anyway, you only need a little. Maybe 2 or 3 CCs (eyeball it). Cover 
this contianer immediatly, before going inside, and before removing your 
protective gear.


>>>Procedure<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Ok. We're now moving to a step by step format, as I know I don't give 
   complex instructions well. Here we go.

1. Take one of your little aluminum tube fragments and stand it on end

2. Take a square of plastic wrap or bag, and using the rounded wire, press     
   it down into the canister. You want a little pocket in the bottem, but    
   you also need to keep the edges of the plastic above the top of the    
   canister.

3. With a method you will discover for yourself (there are several good       
   methods. Find one that works), put a small amount of the TG into the    
   bubble or pocket of plastic in the bottom of the TGC. Just make sure it    
   doesn't completely overflow the sides of the plastic.

4. Take the little piece of wire, or another piece, and use it to fold over    
  the sides of the plastic and tuck them into the TGC. Like this horrid    
  ASCII diagram:

                       _/-|##|-\_     |\/|
                          |##|        |##|
                        ^ |##|        |##|
                        |
              plastic before tucking    ^--- Plastic after tucking 
(# means TG)

5. Pat yourself on the back, for you have finished the first TGC. Now, make 
the rest. Be sure to make one or two (or more) with WATER for a test firing.


>>>Test Firing<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Make sure you KNOW for CERTAIN which TGC aren't really Tear gas, the ones 
that are water (I know you READ THE WHOLE FILE BEFORE BEGINIG AND KNEW TO 
MARK THE WATER FILLED ONES, RIGHT?). Now, take those two (or however many) 
and take them outside or wherever, it doens't matter. Put them in your gun 
(be it CO2 or pneumatic) and set up a target of paper or something. One other 
idea to see how they work is to use some of your mom's perfume or some 
deodorent or something instead of water. This will help you see how well it 
spreads. Anyway, pump the gun up, or whatever the case is, and fire. You 
should see a cloud of gas eject from the gun, as well as the plastic and 
the canister. Neither of the latter two objects will really hurt anyone. 
Hopefully, the cloud of gas WILL!!!! If you decided to use a fragrence of 
one type or another, you should notice the scent filling the area. It can 
spread rather well.


>>>Conclusion<<<
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Be aware that these tear gas cartridges are NEVER to be used as an 
offensive weapon, or for attack in a mugging or such. They should ONLY be 
used for defensive purposes. If you decide to do otherwise, that is your 
problem, and I SHALL NOT be held responsible.
