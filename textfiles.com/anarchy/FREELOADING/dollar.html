
	Ok. First of all, I have tried every single file I could find on how
to rip off coin changers, candy machines, etc. etc. None of them worked.
Believe me, I tried every one. I don't know if these articles were just to
gain a better U/L D/L ratio or what but they didn't work. I have one that
does.

This trick only works on COCA COLA machines. Don't ask me why. It has 
something to do with the validator on the machines.

Take a dollar bill (as crisp as possible) and lay it george-side-up with our 
dear first prez. facing left as if you were going to stick it in the machine.  
now take some scotch tape and make 2 strips as long as the dollar. Now, take 
those pieces of tape and attach them to the white edge of the dollar facing 
you (just the one edge). your dollar should look like this now.

	Now take scotch tape and make bars across the two pieces of tape 
already connected to your dollar(sort of like a ladder) overlapping each one
just a little. Get down to the bottom and turn the bill over and do the same
thing on the other side (just the ladder rungs). now take a pair of sissors
and trim the tape to make it all even and square. now take something hard and
run it over the tape a few times to ensure that it won't come off. (remeber
kindergarten? put the glue on and press down hard while you count to 10?) now
you're ready. take your new and improved currency to the nearest coke machine
with a dollar bill vindicator and insert your dollar. you have to let the
bill go in almost until you cant hold the tape anymore (it's important to let
the bill get in far enough for the scanner to read the dollar) and then whip
it back out. You should hear the click of the machine and your change drop
out. make your selection and voila! Now the cool thing is when you find a
machine that only takes 50 cents. cause you get your coke and 50 cents. I
made 300 dollars one time doing that. no shit.

that's it folks.
