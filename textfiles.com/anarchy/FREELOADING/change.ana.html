   Have you ever seen one of those really big changer machines in airports,
laundrymats or arcades that dispense change when you put in your 1 or 5 dollar
bill?  Well then, here is an article for you.

 1)  Find the type of change machine that you slide in your bill length wise,
not the type where you put the bill in a tray and then slide they tray in!!!

 2)  After finding the right machine, get a $1 or $5 bill.  Start crumpling up
into a ball.  Then smooth out the bill, now it should have a very wrinkly surf
ace.

 3)  Now the hard part.  You must tear a notch in the bill on the left side ab
out 1/2 inch below the little 1 dollar symbol (See Figure).

 4)  If you have done all of this right then take the bill and go out the mach
ine.  Put the bill in the machine and wait.  What should happen is:  when you
put your bill in the machine it thinks everything is fine.  When it gets to
the part of the bill with the notch cut out, the machine will reject the bill
and (if you have done it right) give you the change at the same time!!! So, yo
u end up getting your bill back, plus the change!!  It might take a little pra
ctice, but once you get the hang of it, you can get a lot of money!
