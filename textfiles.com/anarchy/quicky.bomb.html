Ok. Heres a really simple bomb that you
can make from things you've probably go
t lying around the house... What you ne
eed:

A bag of fertilizer
Some Cotton
Some Starter Fluid (etherous kind)
Some Newspaper

Ok... You fold the newspaper until its
in sort of a pocket shape, then fill it
up with fertilizer (not too much).. Nex
t, you put cotton on top of the fertili
zer. Then, pour some starter fluid on i
t (the fertilizer), wrap up the newspap
er (you can use tape). Now this isnt th
e kind of bomb you leave lying around
for a couple days, as it drys out. When
you want to use it, just light the edge
of the newspaper and throw it. Pretty
simple, eh? 
Have Phun, and don't get caught!

P.s. I never noticed before, but all
the formulas, etc. that the dude on
macgyver uses are real, (i checked
quite a few of em).
