CHRISTMAS POEM:
A SACRED MEDITATION


"Oh God, make the day do something different! "
This is the first prayer.
At Easter the Christ rises out of the cake
Wearing long, white gloves
And does his strip-tease for the audience--restless
Because they see it every year, and the mythic symbolism is lost.
The exception approves the role for the big roll out
Always scheduled before Christmas because that is where the hunger is
(The Legendary Bethlahem Steal),
And the baby Jesus, already an expert at all things Talmudic,
Lifts the family car just like young Superman.
The universe is not a riddle, it's a joke.
I picked up the book "Cosmic Understanding" and said Yeah!
This is exactly what I need!
Fun for the whole family, especially if your family's name is Manson.
I particularly liked the writing style,
Beat-it-with-your-fist, I think it's called.
These days it's the 12-step religion that's happening,
Or is it two-step?
They tell you to never become anything that has to die young,
A grand philosophy that reaches some internal organs
And is the opposite of Christianity:
Passion is between lovers and is fun. Rapture means really fun.
Although neither can be proved by scientific methods,
Both are better than the New Age true believers stroking their crystals
And otherwise acting like dorks,
And the psycho-tronz freeing the child within
To be exactly the kind of bastard nobody wants to deal with.
I just finished reading "Wounding the Goddess Within:
Codependancy as a Strategy." I think it's the future.
Call me a heretic, call me a cab.
And if God or Goddess comes barrel-assing down, you can say
You never believed me. I'll vouch for you. I swear.
