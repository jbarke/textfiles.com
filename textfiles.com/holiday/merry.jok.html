I found this while doing some housecleaning in my account, and thought
it was marginally interesting enough to send along to you.

Well, here it is: the long awaited list of "Merry Christmas" programs.  
If you are a crawled-out-from-under-a-rock sort of person and don't 
know what's going on here, then you should read the following sentence:
I don't know what's going on here either.  For some reason, I wanted
to collect a group of programs which print the phrase "Merry Christmas"
15 times.  If you can figure out why I wanted to do this, please let 
me know.

Thanks alot to all the nice folks who inundated me with mail.  Some of 
the submissions made extremely clever use of editors and utility languages
(I'm particularly fond of the UNIX shell script by Ben Hyde).  A few errors
probably crept in due to transmission errors and my editing, and for that
I apologize (because you're probably gonna be swamped by a horde of
prepubescent fault finders).

Several of you requested that I (1) send you personal copies of the results,
(2) send you only the more interesting examples, or (3) send you a report
contrasting and comparing the various syntaxes.  I lost all your names.

If you sent me a submission and it wasn't included, then it either duplicated
a previous entry or never arrived.  I deleted many comments to save space. 
In retrospect, that was probably a mistake.

-- This program counts to 15, but does so  via  three  "concurrently
-- executing"  tasks.   The  output has been modified to be a single
-- character instead of the full  "Merry  Christmas"  message.   The
-- first  task  prints,  sequentially,  0..4.  The second prints, in
-- turn, 5..9; and the third sequentially prints A..E.
-- 
-- If we had used the full "Merry Christmas" line,  then  the  three
-- concurrent  tasks would have (almost certainly) interleaved their
-- respective character strings, and one would have not been able to
-- read any of the messages!
-- 
-- The program was developed by Rob Pearce of JHU/APL, and  was  run
-- on a validated Ada system, the NY University, Ada/ED. The machine
-- was a VAX-11/750 under typical loading. (Note the times;  they're
-- about  the  same  on an empty machine, too!) The listing has been
-- edited to remove the "uninteresting" lines and the  #$^&  control
-- characters.

Here's an APL version.  Since APL uses more than the ASCII character set,
I had to fake it some.  The triangle is the greek character 'del' (an
upside-down delta), the first symbol on line [1] is a 'quad', a
rectangular block, the '<-' is a left arrow, and the lower-case 'p'
is the greek character 'rho'.  Have fun.

	15 15 rho 'Merry Christmas'

(rho is the greek letter of that name, the reshape operator in APL)

That may not count, since it's more like an expression than a
program, but it will do what you asked for.  I guess you could make
it a program if you wanted, as follows:

	del merry
	[1] 15 15 rho 'Merry Christmas'
	del

(del is a little upside-down triangle)

    Here is an APL Merry Christmas. Since APL uses a different chracter set,
I will use the following identifiers for non-ascii chracters:

    ASGN - the back-arrow assignment character
    TRI - upside-down triangle

    HOW'TO MERRY'CHRISTMAS:
	FOR i IN {1..15}:
	    WRITE 'Merry Christmas' /

The string quote in B is used like the underscore in "C".
HOW'TO introduces a procedure declaration.
Indentation is used for grouping statements.
The slash is used in WRITE-commands to indicate a newline.
Actually, this definition should be followed by a call:

    MERRY'CHRISTMAS

You could also write the body of the procedure instead of the call,
and then would have no need for the definition ("B" has no clear
notion of what a program is; usually it's a group of procedures
and functions living together in a workspace).

Well, the most natural choice for Merry Christmas is of course:
	V/N/T/DIT/roff.

This will print it on the standard output, It will give you an extra blank line,
sorry about that.

	.fp 1 MC
	.pl 1
	.nf
	.nr l 0 +1
	.de mm
	.if \\n+l=15 .rm mm
	Merry Christmas
	.mm
	..
	.mm

The font MC is of course your local ``Merry Christmas font''; all the characters
are built from christmas trees.
If you don't want the extra newline you can use the error output:

	.de mm
	.if \\nk=14 .ab Merry Christmas
	.nr k +1
	.tm Merry Christmas
	.mm
	..
	.mm

Of course, you loose the nice look of the MC font.

There are of course about a dozen other ways to use troff for this.

I didn't look closely, but I didn't see a submission in VALGOL.  Here is an
attempt, but I can't vouch for its correctness, since I don't know any valley

behind the times up here.

Like, gag me with a Merry Christmas!
No Way! Merry Christmas!
Like, so totally Merry Christmas!
Barf me out with a Merry Christmas!

I realize this is only five times, not fifteen, but you can multiprocess in
VALGOL.  Just get three valley girls and execute the above on each one.

[Introducing the major motion picture:  THE CHRISTMAS THAT WOULDN'T DIE!  Now
showing at theaters near you!!!  ;-)  ++bsa]

Ratfor (from the book, with the DEC F4P Fortran):

	do(i=1,15) type *, 'Merry Christmas'
	end

Ratforth (AKA Fifth, a language I hacked up to make Forth less ugly):

	define christmas { 
		do(15,0) { 
			type(count("Merry Christmas"));
			CR;
		}
	}

This produces, by the way:

	: christmas 15 0 do " Merry Christmas" count type CR ;

AREXX:

	/* Say Merry Christmas 15 times */
	do i=1 to 15
		say 'Merry Christmas'
		end i
