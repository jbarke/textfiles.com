
             Rudolph the Brown Nose Reindeer

All the reindeer were milling around in the barn a few days before XMAS.
Santa came out to check up on them and Rudolph began sucking up by
telling him how nice his new suit looked.  Santa says, "Well, thank you
for noticing, Rudolph" while eyeing the other reindeer. Rudolph then
starts complimenting Santa on how trim and slim he looks and how he must
surely have lost some weight and begun working out...again Santa thanks
Rudolph.  The other reindeer are muttering, "Sheesh, does this guy never
give up?" After Santa left, the other reindeer began badgering Rudolph
for his blatant kissing up.  Rudolph gives them a haughty look and says,
"Well, just remember when we go flying what YOU GUYS will be looking
at!"
