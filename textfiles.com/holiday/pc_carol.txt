        THE POLITICALLY CORRECT CAROLE 
 
 Deck the halls with boughs of non-endangered plant species 
 Fa la la la la, la la la la 
 'Tis the season to be self-actualizing, 
 Fa la la la la, la la la la 
 Don we now our alternate-lifestyle apparel 
 Fa la la la la, la la la la 
 Toll the ancient non-denominational-winter-solstice-holiday carol 
 Fa la la la la, la la la la 
 
 See the blazing log of non-denominational-winter-solstice-holiday-non- 
     endangered wood before us, 
 Play the harp without unnecessary brutality and join the chorus 
 Sing we emotionally stable in a collective group effort, 
 Heedless of the weather patterns despite the effects of global warming, 
 
 Fast away the chronologically challenged year passes 
 Hail the new year without any implicit ageism, ye persons 
 Dance in a non-hierarchical manner in merry measure, 
 While I tell of non-materialistic, non-denominational-winter-solstice- 
     holiday treasure,
