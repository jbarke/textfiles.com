Ye Children All of Mother Earth
(It came upon a midnight clear...)

Ye children all of Mother Earth
join hands and circle around
To celebrate the Solstice night
When our lost Lord is found.
   Rejoice, the year has begun again
   The Sun blesses skies up above
   So share the season together now
   In everlasting Love!

=======================================
Gloria

Snow lies deep upon the Earth
Still our voices warmly sing
Heralding the glorious birth
Of the Child, the Winter King
   Glo -- ria!
   In excelsis Deo!
   Glo -- ria!
   In excelsis Dea!

Our triumphant voices claim
Joy and hope and love renewed
And our Lady's glad refrain
Answer Winter's solitude
   Glo -- ria!(etc.)

In Her arms a holy Child
Promises a glowing Light
Through the winter wind so wild
He proclaims the growing Light.
   Glo -- ria! (etc..)

Now the turning of the year
Of the greater Turning sings
Passing age of cold and fear
Soon our golden summer brings.
   Glo -- ria! (etc..)

===============================
Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful!

Oh, come all ye faithful
Gather round the Yule Fire
Oh, come ye, oh, come ye,
To call the Sun!
    Fires within us
    Call the Fire above us
    O, come, let us invoke Him!
    O, come, let us invoke Him!
    O, come, let us invoke Him!
    Our Lord, the Sun!

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee!
Born again at Yuletide!
Yule fires and candle flames
Are lighted for You!
     Come to thy children
     Calling for thy blessing!
     O, come let us invoke Him (x3)
     Our Lord, the Sun!

====================================
Silent Night

Silent night, Solstice Night
All is calm, all is bright
Nature slumbers in forest and glen
Till in Springtime She wakens again
Sleeping spirits grow strong!
Sleeping spirits grow strong!

Silent night, Solstice night
Silver moon shining bright
Snowfall blankets the slumbering Earth
Yule fireswelcome the Sun's rebirth
Hark, the Light is reborn!
Hark, the Light is reborn!

Silent night, Solstice night
Quiet rest till the Light
Turning ever the rolling Wheel
Brings the Winter to comfort and heal
Rest your spirit in peace!
Rest your spirit in peace!

========================================
Glory to the New Born King

Brothers, sisters, come to sing
Glory to the new-born King!
Gardens peaceful, forests wild
Celebrate the Winter Child!
    Now the time of glowing starts!
    Joyful hands and joyful hearts!
    Cheer the Yule log as it burns!
    For once again the Sun returns!
    Brothers, sisters, come and sing!
    Glory to the new-born King!

Brothers, sisters, singing come
Glory to the newborn Sun
Through the wind and dark of night
Celebrate the coming light.
    Suns glad rays through fear's cold burns
    Life through death the Wheel now turns
    Gather round the Yule log and tree
    Celebrate Life's mystery
    Brothers, sisters, singing come
    Glory to the new-born Sun.
