  CURRENT CHANGES and CONSTRUCTION
  -- Adventureland, The Temple of the Forbidden Eye. A new attraction based
  upon the "Indiana Jones" character due to open in Spring 1995 (end of
  February). This attraction incorporates a unique ride system to navigate
  troop transports through the Temple and explore the power of the native god
  Mara. Willpower and courage is needed to avoid the curse befalled to anyone
  who looks into Mara's eyes. You and your fellow passengers choose which
  path to take at the Chamber of Destiny.  The ride building can be seen from
  the parking areas, emerging from the jungles of Adventureland. The outdoor
  queue area is open for guests to explore the excavation camp and catch a
| glimpse of what happening with the Indiana Jones site.
| -- Adventureland Bazaar and Shops undergoing refurbishment scheduled to
| open in December.
| -- Continuing Main Street storefront refurbishment.
| -- The Camera store on Main St. will be moved to the end of the block at
| the former Carefree Corner. FotoToons was removed to make room for an
| expansion of the clothing store.
| -- Skyway has been removed from the park joining the list of permanently
| closed attractions with Mission to Mars, Motor Boats, and The Town Square
| Cafe.
| --Tomorrowland Terrace undergoing major refurbishment. The band area was
| rearranged to now play out toward the Tomorrowland Autopia area.
| --A elevator is being added to the Disneyland Hotel monorail station for
| easier guest access.

| PARK HAPPENINGS:
|         GENERAL:
| * New folding-format, Disneyland Today Park Guide. Replaced the old booklet
| style souvenir guide.
| * Handicapped parking has been significantly increased. Preferred parking
| for Premium Annual Pass holders has been moved from the Bambi section to
| the Donald section.
|         MAIN STREET U.S.A.:
| * Main Street buildings repainted in a more colorful scheme of colors.
| * Audio added to windows above Main Street storefronts. Listen in the small
| alley near the Cone Shop and Lockers.  Hotel Marceline, Piano Lessons, and
| a detective agency provide three different spiels roughly about 5 minutes
| each.
| * Plaza Inn is now the Plaza Inn Rotisserie serving full, complete meals
| (rotisserie chicken and Prime Rib) with beverage included.
| * Disneyland Railroad updated the audio spiel to include Mickey's Toontown.
| * The Main Street Bank replaced the Bank of America branch.
| * 'The Lion King' movie dioramas grace the Main Street shop windows.
| * New Century Timepiece Shop added custom, hand-drawn, artist watches of
| Disney Characters where guest can see them being crafted.
  * Added a lifesize bronze statue, titled 'Partners', of Walt Disney with
  Mickey Mouse in the hub encircled with smaller bronze statues of classic
  Disney characters.
  * Penny Arcade displays a large, green, 1000-pound, acrylic elephant statue
  (nicknamed 'Penny') near the entrance.  It was originally designed for the
  Candy Palace at Disneyland-Paris but due to a change in color scheme of
  that facility, she now resides at Disneyland.
          ADVENTURELAND:
| * Jungle Cruise refurbishment completed.  New boat dock, a two-story boat-
| house queue area, and a new trading post.  Also, re-themed boats which are
| more rustic and each one is unique based upon their previous "owners".
  * Enchanted Tiki Room pre-show area was altered for better visibility, and
  the show uses a digital sound system (although the soundtrack and story is
  still the same.)
| * Larger entrance to accommodate the crowds generated by Fantasmic!, includ-
| ing some changes to the Enchanted Tiki Room pre-show area.
          FRONTIERLAND:
| * Big Thunder BBQ lowered the price of their menu by adding BBQ chicken and
| Beef Brisket. Some consider this restaurant the best value in the park.
| * ATM added near the entrance of Frontierland.
  * Casa Mexicana is no longer sponsored by Lawry's.  Slight changes in decor
  and menu items (like Mickey Mouse-shaped flan).
          NEW ORLEANS SQUARE:
  * Fantasmic! sound system improvements and a new viewing area (New Orleans
  Square Promenade) around the Rivers of America.  Promenade is tiered and
  angled to provide better viewing of Fantasmic!
| * Disney Gallery exhibits feature Disneyland-Paris artwork and Indiana Jones
| attraction art.
   * Disney Gallery offering preferred balcony seatings of Fantasmic! with a
| dessert buffet, and coffee for $30.
  * Pet Cemetery added to the front yard of The Haunted Mansion.
  * Pirates of the Caribbean added portraits of pirates along the walls of the
  indoor queue area.  Added previously were silhouettes of fighting pirates
  located on the right side of the burning city scene.  This scene was taken
  from Disneyland-Paris.  Also, additional items were added in the bayou near
  the boat loading area.  Waterfall area now sprinkles guests with liquid
  magic (water).  Mist has been added just before entering into the battling
  ship area. Possible new pirate figures installed for the drunken pirate
| figure hanging over (whoops, a pun) a bridge in the burning city scene, the
| pirate with the barking dog next to the hidden girl in a barrel scene, and
| the shooting pirate on the left prior to the exit ramp. Subwoofer speakers
| are planned to be added to various parts inside the attraction to heighten
| the experience.
|         CRITTER COUNTRY:
| * Splash Mountain changed the name of the unseen bear living in the cave
| outside the first set of falls from 'Rufus' to 'Briar Bear'. Before Splash
| Mountain was built, that area was the access to Bear Country and snores
| could be heard from the caves above. To provide continuity, when Splash
| Mountain was built, a home for Rufus was built. Since Splash Mountain was
| popular and duplicated in Florida and Tokyo, the name was changed to 'Briar
| Bear' for better continuity with the movie, "Song of the South".
          FANTASYLAND:
| * Storybook Land refurbished to include structures from recent movies
  (Aladdin, Beauty & the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc.) and add a waterfall
  over the 'neverland' cave.  The upgrade will be completed in phases for a
| |ull completion date sometime in 1995.  Disneyland-Paris recently added
| this attraction which probably accounts for the improvements here.
| * Village Haus Restaurant underwent changes to include Italian food items
| like pizza, pasta, and salads.
  * Sleeping Beauty's Castle walk-through now appears to be permanently open.
  * It's a Small World boasts a digital sound system complete with a different
| soundtrack (with more instrumentals) inherited from Disneyland-Paris.
  * Fantasia Gardens filled the space left from the removal of the Motor
  Boats.
  * Window near Peter Pan's Flight with children's toys in it has audio of the
  Darling children playing.
          TOMMORROWLAND:
| * The Skyway was removed as it no longer complied with updated California
| safety codes. Current information suggests it will *not* be replaced. Write
| Disneyland and voice your opinion concerning the closure.
| * Monorail audio spiel changed.
  * Space Place: Disneyland Birthday Parties on weekends. Two different party
  plans are available which include cake, ice cream, party favors, character
  photo opportunities, lunch (with one of the plans), and park admission.
  Call 714-520-5045 for details on Birthday Parties.
          MICKEY'S TOONTOWN:
  * Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin ride is open.  This wild and zany attraction
  captures the feeling of being in a cartoon world with Roger Rabbit and
  friends. Turn the steering wheel to spin your cab around 360 degrees and
  avoid "The Dip".  Entertaining, but deceptive queue area walks you through
  the back alleys of Toontown prior to boarding your cab.  This is
  Disneyland's newest attraction.
  * Toontown's Jolly Trolley is jolly again.  The trolley now bounces all
  around (like it originally did) during it's trip through Toontown (although
  usually one car per trolley instead of two).
          OTHER:
  * Low Price Children's menus for $2.99 at most table service and buffeteria
  restaurants.
| * Disneyland Hotel restaurant 'Caffe Villa Verde' indoor/outdoor cafe
| changed menu and added Mediterranean theming and now serves pizza, pasta,
| and rotisserie chicken specialties.
  * Disneyland Hotel access to the waterfall area has been restricted.
  * ATM outside main entrance changed sponsorship to First Interstate Bank.

  Future Plans and Rumors:

  * Westcot Center, a west coast version of WDW EPCOT Center, is planned to be
  built in the current Disneyland parking lot as part of a master plan for
  The Disneyland Resort.  A multi-level parking structure will be constructed
  to the east.  It will feature dedicated freeway ramps to funnel cars di-
  rectly into the parking structure with transportation and a peoplemover to
  transport guests over to the parks. Expansion plans also include multiple
| hotels and other entertainment venues.  Project has encountered numerous
| delays but WDC President, Michael Eisner still remains committed to the
| project. Details about the expansion plan are available at the Disneyland
  expansion preview center located at the Disneyland Hotel (in the Plaza
| building, above Maize's Pantry) and is open on Wednesdays from 12 pm to 5
| pm or by appointment at 714-956-6732..

  WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SEE FANTASMIC!?
    Come in from the Splash Mountain side as soon as they start clearing out
  the crowds from the first show. If you come in from the other side, you'll
  be fighting 7,000-10,000 people who are exiting out through Frontierland.
  The show lasts about 23 minutes and the entire area is darkened during the
  show making travel through here a little tricky.

  HOW DO I BEAT THE CROWDS?
    Unlike WDW, Disneyland does not usually open the park early to deal with
  incoming crowds.  However, often on weekends Main Street will open 30
  minutes before the rest of the park.  Some tour packages do offer a "Magic
  Morning" package which allows participants to enter a themed area (usually
  Toontown) one hour prior to opening to the general public.

  In general, attendance is highest on Saturday, then Friday, Sunday, and
  weekdays.  Monday through Wednesday is probably the best day to visit to
| avoid the large crowds.  Early arrival is a great way to enjoy the more
| popular attractions before other guests arrive.  If you're staying in the
| area, take a mid-day break from the park and relax in your room for a
| while.  This way, you avoid the most crowded part of the day when lines are
| long and return recharged to stay again until closing time.

  Space Mountain is long most of the day and into the night, so first thing
  in early morning is usually your best bet.  Ditto Rocket Jets.  Star Tours
  will shorten significantly in the late evening (when the line is completely
  inside, you're in good shape).  Splash Mountain is always busy (avoid it
  when backed up beyond the Briar Patch shop) but is OK when it's raining or
  right before the park closes.  An early-morning dash might also be a good
  idea (since it's at the back of the park).  The Country Bear Jamboree is
  seldom crowded and it a good place to visit if you ventured over to Splash
  Mountain and found a long line.

  For dinner, venture over to the Disneyland Hotel to get some relief from
  the crowds and then head back in.  The Monorail Cafe has excellent food
  with good portions. Goofy's Kitchen Character Dinner is all-you-can-eat,
  all-you-can-drink.  Alcoholic beverages are available but not all-you-can-
  drink :-).

  After dinner, the attractions in Fantasyland shorten a bit, but not much.
  Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride will remain
  popular throughout the entire day.  Lines are usually short for Snow
  White's Scary Adventures, Pinocchio's Daring Journey, and It's a Small
  World.  If the line is long at all, skip it and try again later.

  Matterhorn lines are usually the shortest during the parades.  Normally
  there are two separate lines, one for each bobsled run.  But sometimes
  during the parades they combine both lines into one and route it away from
  the parade area.  This gives the impression the wait is long but is really
  it is moving twice as fast.  The line splits up into two later on as you go
  through the turnstile.  Usually the bobsled run on the right has the
  shortest wait since most people turn to the left as they enter the
  turnstile area.

  PARADES
| Crossing a parade route is possible but time consuming.  Certain areas are
| marked for crossing and guests are allowed to cross during gaps in the
| parade. Plan which side of the park you want to be on during the parade and
  get there early.  If you must cross, consider using the Disneyland RR or
  the Skyway.  Parade crossing zones north of the Matterhorn are usually less
  congested than the one at the Hub. Main Street is tough (though not impos-
  sible) to negotiate during popular parades.

  WHAT ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN?
  Kids age 2 and under are free.  Strollers may be rented, but some people
  prefer to bring their own.  Many attractions have height and age
  requirements, with limit signs ('You must be at least this tall...')
  present at the entrance to most attractions.  They seem to be fairly picky
  about this.  If you're an inch off, they won't let you in.

       Space Mountain                       40+ inches

  HOW DO I GET A MAGIC KINGDOM CLUB (MKC) CARD AND WHAT DOES IT GET ME?
  MKC stands for the Magic Kingdom Club which is a benefit originally
  provided to employees of large businesses for discounts on Disneyland
  admissions. The program has expanded to other Disney parks and merchandise.
  Check with your employer or credit union first, especially if you live near
  any Disney attractions.  If not, you can purchase a Gold MKC for $59 for 2
  years. The address is Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card, PO Box 3850, Anaheim,
  CA 92803-3850. Charge by calling (714) 490-3200.  Gold card members get a
  2-year subscription to Disney Magazine, a personalized gold membership
  card, travel video, tote bag, and other goodies. Both types of MKC cards
  get you the same discounts at the Disney Stores (except in the parks), on
  admission tickets, and on Disney, Delta Airlines, and National Rent-a-Car
  packages. The discount for both MKC cards are the same.  The discounts do
  NOT apply to merchandise at the park or the Disneyland Hotel but will
  provide a 15% discount at Aladdin's Oasis and the Blue Bayou (2-5pm only).
  The card is also good for 10% off at The Disney Stores which are usually
  found in shopping malls throughout the world.

  DISNEYLAND HOTEL: $$$$
    Official hotel for Disneyland including many shops and attractions and
  the only hotel with a monorail station for transportation into the Magic
  Kingdom. Since this is a Disney property, it provides the best "Disney
  experience". Great shops, restaurants, and swimming pools. Free evening
  water shows and other entertainment. Hotel guests can have their park
  merchandise purchases delivered to their rooms free of charge.  Call 714-
  956-MICKEY for room reservations.
  PAN PACIFIC: $$$
    Located next to the Disneyland Hotel.  Rooms are about half the price of
  the Disneyland Hotel rooms and are large and quiet with comfortable beds
  but somewhat dated decor. Average, no frills.. No refrigerators or
  microwave ovens in the room but does have on-site restaurants (including
  Japanese) and room service is available.  A walkway provides access to the
  Disneyland Hotel Resort's amenities such as shops and restaurants and
  Monorail station for transportation into the Disneyland Park.
  ANAHEIM HILTON AND TOWERS: $$$
    "Above average Hilton."  Small bathrooms (at least in non-tower rooms).
  MARRIOTT: $$$
    "Typical Marriott."  Nobody said anything particularly good or bad.
  PEACOCK SUITES, S. Harbor (just north of Katella).
    Clive Feather (clive@sco.com) says "I can speak well of Peacock
  Suites...We had a 3-room suite (lounge, double bedroom with en-suite, twin
  double bedroom, and additional bathroom) for $129 a night plus tax.
  Continental Breakfast included and free hourly Disneyland shuttle is
  available. It's also a reasonable walk to the park."
| MAGIC CARPET MOTEL: $
|   "Reasonable place to sleep" according to James Moore (james@wrs.com)
  BEST WESTERN STARDUST: $$
    "Very spacious.  Clean comfortable and reasonably priced.  Walking
  distance, but a Disneyland shuttle is also available.  No frills."
  RESIDENCE INN: $$$
    Very nice, apartment-like suites with complete, full-size kitchens and
  some with fireplaces.  Continental Breakfast included and free Disneyland
  shuttle is available (with stops to the Disneyland Hotel if requested).

  WHAT PARTS OF DISNEYLAND CAN I SKIP IF I'VE BEEN TO WALT DISNEY WORLD?
  There are subtle differences in almost every corner of the park.  If you're
  a Disney aficionado, you'll want to check out everything.  If you're
  pressed for time, you can skip the following:
  o Haunted Mansion
  o People Mover (more primitive, but seems to last longer)
  o Monorail (unless you want to go to the Disneyland Hotel)
  o Captain EO (same movie as EPCOT Center)
  o Circle Vision 360 (same as at WDW but also shows China film from EPCOT
    during the early part of the day.)
  o Autopia
  o Small World (biggest difference is the exterior facade, including a
  special presentation of the time every 15 minutes)
  o Golden Horseshoe Jamboree (same show, different finale)

  Tough calls:  (similar, yet different and worth experiencing)
  o Space Mountain
  o Big Thunder Mountain Railroad
| o Submarine Voyage (WDW version was removed this year, DL version similar
|   except for order of presentation and absence of Jules Verne nuances)
  o Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (a trimmed down version of the Hall of
    Presidents) and The Walt Disney Story
  o Splash Mountain (front/back seating instead of side-to-side, story not as
    narrative.)
  o Country Bear Playhouse (different show and DL has 2 theaters,)
  o Disneyland Hotel resort complex (accessible from within the park by
    monorail).

  Whatever you do, don't miss out on:
  o Fantasmic!
| o Star Tours (unless you've been on the Disney/MGM Studios version. Best
|   seat is back row, far right.)
  o Matterhorn Bobsleds (2 different tracks, too)
  o Jungle Cruise (my DL experiences have far surpassed the one at WDW)
  o Pirates of the Caribbean (parts are identical, but DL is better)
  o The Disney Gallery (above Pirates of the Caribbean). This originally was
  built as an apartment for Walt Disney.
  o Disneyland RR between Tomorrowland & Main Street for Grand Canyon and
  Primeval World dioramas (not quite as impressive as EPCOT's World of Energy
| dinosaurs, but fun anyway)
  o Mickey's ToonTown (new land)
  o Roger Rabbit's Cartoon Spin ride (Toontown)
  o Aladdin's Oasis (extra cost, about $25 per person)

  The Disneyland parade route is different than WDW.  North of Main Street,
  Disneyland parades proceed north along the east side of the Castle up to
  It's a Small World.  WDW MK parades turn at the Hub, heading through
  Liberty Square and Frontierland.
