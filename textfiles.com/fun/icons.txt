Put some expression into your text!

             Are you afraid that you come across differently
      electronically than you do on paper, over the phone or
      in person?  The answer may be icons!  The icons listed
     below can help you express those no-verbal signals that
     are all but impossible to express over the net.

     Any additions to this list would be greatly appreciated!
     Send all comments and additions to David Melnik at 107/233.
