Economy
Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world.
During the period 1980-85 it had a population growth of 3% a year and
a - 0.4% GDP growth rate. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is
the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 40% of GDP, employing about
85% of the labor force, and contributing more than 70% to export earnings.
Industry is confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
manufacturing; in 1988 it contributed only 16% to GDP and employed 3% of the
labor force. Industrial development has been hampered by government policies
that have restricted imports of equipment and spare parts and put strict
controls on foreign-owned enterprises. In 1986 the government introduced a
five-year development plan that stresses self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice)
by 1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.

Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export revenues. After

in 1988 as a result of good weather and a broadly based economic
adjustment effort by the government. The closure of traditional trade
routes through Mozambique continues to be a constraint on the economy.

Economy
Overview: In 1988-89 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to recover
from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 8.7% in 1988 and
about 7.7% in 1989, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing output and
further increases in foreign direct investment, particularly from
Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home. Malaysia has
become the world's third-largest producer of semiconductor devices
(after the US and Japan) and the world's largest exporter of semiconductor
devices. Inflation remained low as unemployment stood at about 8% of
the labor force and as the government followed prudent fiscal/monetary
policies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and a majority
of the rural population subsists at the poverty level. Malaysia's
high export dependence (merchandise exports are 63% of GDP) leaves
it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries or a fall in
world commodity prices.

Economy
Overview: The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping.
Agriculture is limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that provide
only 10% of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry, employing 80%
of the work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is also an
important source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism has become one
of the most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988
industry accounted for about 14% of GDP. Real GDP is officially
estimated to have increased by about 10% annually during the period
1974-86, and GDP estimates for 1988 show a further growth of 9% on
the strength of a record fish catch and an improved tourist season.

Economy
Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic
location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its
food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy
sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and
services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the
economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 30% of GDP, with the textile and
clothing industry a major contributor. In 1988 inflation was held to a low 0.9%.
Per capita GDP at $5,100 places Malta in the middle-income range of the world's
nations.

Economy
Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of
the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology
companies and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in
expanding employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result,
agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in
their shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing
about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK.

Economy
Overview: Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy.
Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important
commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle
ranches supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to
handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary
source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The islands
have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987 the US
Government provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese budget of
$55 million.

Economy
Overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light
industry. Agriculture accounts for about 7% of GDP and the small industrial
sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now
used for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, however, going
mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work
force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1984 the
annual per capita income was relatively high at $3,650. During 1985 the
unemployment rate was between 25% and 30% and was particularly severe among
younger workers.

Economy
Overview: A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent drought in 1983.
Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore that account for almost 50% of
total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to
cutbacks in production in recent years. The nation's coastal waters are among
the richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986.

Economy
Overview: Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants
(notably oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
traditional agriculture. In the 1980s Mexico experienced severe economic
difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world
petroleum prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic
food supply; and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate
became more acute. Growth in national output dropped from 8% in
1980 to 1.1% in 1988 and 2.5% in 1989. The US is Mexico's major
trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of its exports and
imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and tourism are the largest
earners of foreign exchange. The government, in consultation with international
economic agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy
and foster growth.

Economy
Overview: Financial assistance from the US is the primary source

and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry
exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate
facilities hinder development; note--GNP numbers reflect US spending.

Economy
Overview: No data are published on the economy. Monaco, situated
on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists
to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has successfully sought to
diversify into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries.
The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign
companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual
revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels, banks, and the industrial
sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism. Living standards are
high, that is, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French
metropolitan suburbs.

Economy
Overview: After registering a robust 10% growth in 1988, the

Economy
Overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, with a per capita GDP of
little more than $100, Mozambique has failed to exploit the economic potential
of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and transportation resources.
Indeed, national output, consumption, and investment declined throughout the
first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders, lack of government
administrative control, and a growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign
aid, attracted by an economic reform policy, has resulted in successive years of
economic growth since 1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is only
at about 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry
operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy depends heavily on
foreign assistance to keep afloat.

Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and
the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are
among the richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for
gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal.

Economy
Overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves
of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given
Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
World--$10,000 annually. Few other resources exist so
most necessities must be imported, including fresh water from
Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income
from phosphates constitute serious long-term problems. Substantial
investment in trust funds, out of phosphate income, will help cushion the
transition.

Economy
Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the
world with a per capita income of only $158. Real growth averaged 4% in the
1980s until FY89, when it plunged to 1.5% because of the ongoing
trade/transit dispute with India. Agriculture is the mainstay of the
economy, providing a livelihood for over 90% of the population and
accounting for 60% of GDP and about 75% of exports. Industrial activity is
limited, and what there is involves the processing of agricultural
produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain).
Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable natural
resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Despite considerable investment in
the agricultural sector, production in the 1980s has not kept pace with the
population growth of 2.7%, which has led to a reduction in exportable surpluses
and balance-of-payments difficulties. Economic prospects for the 1990s
remain grim.

Economy
Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however,
through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs
affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial
services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity,
including construction, provides about 25% of GDP, and is led by the
food-processing, oil-refining, and metal-working industries. The highly
mechanized agricultural sector employs only 6% of the
labor force, but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. An unemployment rate of over 8.6% and a sizable
budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems.

Economy
Overview: Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the
mainstays of the economy. The islands enjoy a comparatively high per
capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other
countries in the region. Unlike many Latin American countries, the
Netherlands Antilles has avoided large international debt. Almost all
consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US being the major
supplier. The economy has suffered somewhat in recent years because
of the depressed state of the world oil market and declining tax revenues.
In 1983 the drop in oil prices led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar, which ended a substantial flow of Venezuelan tourists to the
islands. As a result of a decline in tax revenues, the government has
been seeking financial support from the Netherlands.

Economy
Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an
agrarian economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open
free market economy that can compete on the global scene. The government
has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes, reduce
inflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The
results have been mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels
but growth has been sluggish and unemployment, always a highly sensitive
issue, has been at a record high 7.4%. In 1988 GDP fell by 1% and in
1989 grew by a moderate 2.4%.

Economy
Overview: Government control of the economy historically has been
extensive, although the new government has pledged to reduce it.
The financial system is directly controlled by the state, which also
regulates wholesale purchasing, production, sales, foreign trade, and
distribution of most goods. Over 50% of the agricultural and industrial
firms are state owned. Sandinista economic policies and the war have
produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation of the economy
continues to be the export of agricultural commodities, largely coffee
and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989, the fifth
successive year of decline. The agricultural sector employs 44%
of the work force and accounts for 23% of GDP and 86% of export earnings.
Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes 26% to GDP,
showed a sharp drop of - 23% in 1988 and remains below pre-1979 levels.
External debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis.
In 1989 the annual inflation rate was 1,700%, down from a record
16,000% in 1988. Shortages of basic consumer goods are widespread.

Economy

Overview: About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and
stock rearing, activities which generate almost half of the national income.
The economy also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits.
Uranium production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the
early 1980s, when world prices declined. France is a major customer,
while FRG, Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed
demand for uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the
economy, a severe trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.

Economy
Overview: In 1989, despite rising oil prices, the economic
performance failed to meet government expectations because of higher
inflationary pressures fueled by a relatively poor agricultural
performance. Agricultural production was up only 4% following a 10%
decline in 1988, and manufacturing remained below the 1985 level
with only a 6% increase. The government is continuing an economic
adjustment program to reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil and to help
create a basis for sustainable noninflationary growth.

Economy
Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand. Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the
shortfall made up by grants from New Zealand--the grants are used to pay
wages to the 80% or more of the work force employed in public service.
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories
to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of
postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue.
The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population
because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

Economy
Overview: The primary economic activity is tourism, which has brought
a level of prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific Islands. The
number of visitors has increased steadily over the years and reached almost
30,000 in 1986. Revenues from tourism have given the island a favorable balance
of trade and helped the agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in the
production of beef, poultry, and eggs.

Economy
Overview: Norway is a prosperous capitalist nation with the resources
to finance extensive welfare measures. Since 1975 exploitation of large
crude oil and natural gas reserves has helped achieve an average annual
growth of roughly 4%, the third-highest among OECD countries. Growth
slackened in 1987-88 because of the sharp drop in world oil prices and a
slowdown in consumer spending, but picked up again in 1989. Future
economic issues involve the aging of the population, the increased
economic integration of Europe, and the balance between private and
public influence in economic decisions.

Pacific Ocean
Geography
Total area: 165,384,000 km2; includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea,
Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea,
Gulf of Alaska, Makassar Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan,
Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies

Comparative area: slightly less than 18 times the size of the US;
the largest ocean (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Arctic
Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the total
land area of the world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: the western Pacific is monsoonal--a rainy season occurs during
the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the
land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from
the Asian land mass back to the ocean

Terrain: surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm
water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by
a counterclockwise, cool water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and
Sea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from
Antarctica in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by
the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches;
the world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Environment: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion,
sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and
South China Sea; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
the southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, which
kills the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies;
consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident
marine birds to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source

Note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal,
Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean
into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south
from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June to
December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic
and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire

Economy
Overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.
It provides cheap sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish catch
came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish catch
has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas
reserves is playing an ever increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia,
New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil
and gas, combined with the lower world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed
but not stopped new drillings.

Industries: fishing, oil and gas production

Communications
Ports: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US),
Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US),
Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (USSR),
Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)

Telecommunications: several submarine cables with network focused
on Guam and Hawaii
