-=- 03.1.Elists & newsgroups  |
-------------------------------

Two of the most common forms of discourse in virtual culture occur on the
elist (or electronic mailing list) and the USENET newsgroup. While the
up-to-date listings of what elists or newsgroups are up and running are
available on the newsgroup news.answers or the ftp site rftm.mit.edu
(/pub/usenet-by-group/rec.answers) it is very time consuming to examine
each list thouroughly. The following are a few lists which either have
helped to form virtual culture or deal with various aspects of it.

A short bit on the Usenet Hierarchy. Alt.groups is supposed to stand for
alternative, but should probably stand for adolescent. These are news
groups waiting to grow up and consequently have a low signal to noise
ratio. But like adolescents, if you really listen to them, you can gleem
some really neat insights. When Alt.groups get a large enough following or
a serious enough topic, they tend to graduate into other prefixes; ie,
comp. (computer) rec. (recreation), sci. (science), bit. (Bitnet
listservs), soc. (social, society). What this means generally, is that the
group becomes heady and cliqueish. But if you're persistant ad polite, you
can usually elicit a response from somebody. One final comment about
USENET, anything I said above is likely to be untrue at any moment in
time. Thus the attraction of USENET for even the most experienced
cyberpoets.

-=- 03.2.Cafes          |
-------------------------

If you see a net.user with more then one window open, chances are one of
those windows is linked to an electronic cafe. Like ER, these coffeehouse
atmospheres are prime spots for chatting or perhaps a little gaming or
roleplaying. The two most plentiful forms of these cafes in virtual
culture are Mu*s, or Multi-User Dimension or Dungeon (MUDS, MUSE, MUSH,
etc), and IRC, or Internet Relay Chat and of course the orginal, the BBS.
But new versions, offshoots, and even completely different surroundings
are likely to spring up at anytime and often do.
