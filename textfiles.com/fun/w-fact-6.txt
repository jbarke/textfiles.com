Economy
Overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By
treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights
to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,
Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies
still mining are Norwegian and Soviet. Each company mines about half a million
tons of coal annually. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company
towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the
Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services, and
provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal,
polar bear, fox, and walrus.

Economy
Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies
much of the labor force and contributes about 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which
includes a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another 25% of GDP.
Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits
were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos.
Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.

is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives 90% of its imports
and to which it sends about one-third of its exports.

Economy
Overview: Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during
World War I through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable
standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and
extensive welfare benefits. It has essentially full employment,
a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
communications, and a skilled and intelligent labor force. Timber,
hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms
account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering
sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. As the 1990s open,
however, Sweden faces serious economic problems: long waits for
adequate housing, the decay of the work ethic, and a loss of
competitive edge in international markets.

Economy
Overview: Switzerland's economic success is matched in few, if any,
other nations. Per capita output, general living standards, education
and science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation
remains low because of sound government policy and harmonious
labor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked
contrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic
stability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since
World War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great
changes in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust
to the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic
integration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East
European political/economic prospects.

Economy
Overview: Syria's rigidly structured Bathist economy is turning out
roughly the same amount of goods in 1989 as in 1983, when the population
was 20% smaller. Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe
drought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts to match
Israel's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and insufficient foreign
exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture. Socialist
policy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations, in many instances
has driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit
for which Syrian businessmen have long been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable
number of villagers have benefited from land redistribution, electrification,
and other rural development programs; and a recent find of light crude oil
has enabled Syria to cut back its substantial imports of light crude. A
long-term concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by
Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed toward the end
of the 1990s.

Economy
Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 40% of
GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
accounts for about 10% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in
mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund have increased the availability of
imports and provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated
economic infrastructure.

Economy
Overview: Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries
in Asia, enjoyed its second straight exceptionally prosperous year in
1989. Real output again rose about 11%. The increasingly sophisticated
manufacturing sector benefited from export-oriented investment, and
agriculture grew by 4.0% because of improved weather. The trade deficit
of $5.2 billion was more than offset by earnings from tourism
($3.9 billion), remittances, and net capital inflows. The government has
followed a fairly sound fiscal and monetary policy, aided by increased
tax receipts from the fast-moving economy. In 1989 the government
approved new projects--roads, ports, electric power,
communications--needed to refurbish the now overtaxed infrastructure.
Although growth in 1990-91 must necessarily fall below the 1988-89 pace,
Thailand's immediate economic outlook is good, assuming the continuation
of prudent government policies in the context of a
private-sector-oriented development strategy.

self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial
sector phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings.

Economy
Overview: Tokelau's small size, isolation, and lack of resources
greatly restrain economic development and confine agriculture to the
subsistence level. The people must rely on aid from New Zealand to maintain
public services, annual aid being substantially greater than GDP.
The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra, postage stamps,
souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to families from
relatives in New Zealand.

Economy
Overview: Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy has been in
decline since 1982. During the first half of the 1980s, the petroleum sector
accounted for nearly 80% of export earnings, 40% of government revenues,
and almost 25% of GDP. In recent years, however, the economy has suffered
because of the sharp fall in the price of oil. The government, in response to
the revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures that pushed the
unemployment rate to 22% in 1988. Agriculture employs only about 11% of
the labor force and produces less than 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it
has been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed. The
government currently seeks to diversify its export base.

Economy
Overview: The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, and
tourism for continued growth. Two successive drought-induced crop
failures have strained the government's budget and increased
unemployment.  The current account fell from a $23 million surplus in
1988 to a $390 million deficit in 1989. Despite its foreign payments
problems, Tunis appears committed to its IMF-supported structural
adjustment program. Nonetheless, the government may have to slow its
implementation to head off labor unrest.  The increasing foreign
debt--$7.6 billion at yearend 1989--is also a key problem. Tunis
probably will seek debt relief in 1990.

Economy
Overview: The economic reforms that Turkey launched in 1980 continue
to bring an impressive stream of benefits. The economy has grown steadily since
the early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP increasing more than 6%
annually. Agriculture remains the most important economic sector,
employing about 60% of the labor force, accounting for almost 20% of GDP, and
contributing about 25% to exports. Impressive growth in recent years has not
solved all of the economic problems facing Turkey. Inflation and interest rates
remain high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties
for a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally
controlled to a free market economy. The government has launched a
multimillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which
includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to
generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned
tapping of huge quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in the
downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq.

Economy
Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and
cobalt. For most of the past 15 years the economy has been devastated by
political instability, mismanagement, and civil war, keeping Uganda poor
with a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels
of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.) Agriculture is the
most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work
force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounted for 97% of export
revenues in 1988. Since 1986 the government has acted to rehabilitate and
stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer
prices on export crops, increasing petroleum prices, and
improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at
dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and boosting
production and export earnings.

Economy
Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's higher
levels of income per capita. This wealth is based on oil and gas, and the

Economy
Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and
financial centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in
Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture
of social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade
the Thatcher government has halted the expansion of welfare measures and
has promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor
force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
about 24% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an
energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;
primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest
shares of any industrial nation. Following the recession of 1979-81, the
economy has enjoyed the longest period of continuous economic growth it
has had during the last 30 years. During the period 1982-89 real GDP grew
by about 25%, while the inflation rate of 14% was nearly halved. Between
1986 and 1989 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%. As a major trading
nation, the UK will continue to be greatly affected by: world boom or
recession; swings in the international oil market; productivity trends in

Economy
Overview: The US has the most powerful and diversified economy in
the world, with a per capita GNP of over $21,000, the largest among the
major industrial nations. In 1989 the economy entered its eighth

with massive budget and trade deficits, huge and rapidly rising medical
costs, and inadequate investment in industrial capacity and economic
infrastructure.

Economy
Overview: The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of
1981-84. In 1986 real GDP grew by 6.6% and in 1987 by 4.9%. The recovery
was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture
alone contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and
generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In
1988, despite healthy exports and an improved current account, domestic
growth slowed because of government concentration on the external sector,
adverse weather conditions, and prolonged strikes. High inflation rates
of about 80%, a large domestic debt, and frequent strikes remain major economic
problems for the government.

Economy
Overview: This is a centrally planned, developing economy with
extensive government ownership and control of productive facilities.
The economy is primarily agricultural, employing about 65% of the labor
force and accounting for almost half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop;
substantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are
also grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open
market. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,
including coal, which is an important export item. Following the
end of the war in 1975, heavy handed government measures undermined
efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the
south and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains
heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from
Communist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down
from recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness, and per
capita output is among the world's lowest. Since early 1989 the
government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
economic activity over to the private sector.

West Bank
Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
Heights.  As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President
Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the final status of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned
parties.  Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the
respective boundaries.  Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy
that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be
determined.  In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the
area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.  However, with respect to negotiations envisaged in the
framework agreement, it is US policy that a distinction must be made between
Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status
and circumstances.  Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West
Bank.

Economy
Overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli
military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising. Industries
using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been
discouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy. Capital
investment has largely gone into residential housing, not into productive assets
that could compete with Israeli industry. A major share of GNP is derived from
remittances of workers employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states. Israeli
reprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West Bank since 1987 have pushed
unemployment up and lowered living standards.

Economy
Overview: In 1989 the World economy grew at an estimated 3.0%,
somewhat lower than the estimated 3.4% for 1988. The technologically advanced
areas--North America, Japan, and Western Europe--together account for
65% of the gross world product (GWP) of $20.3 trillion; these developed
areas grew in the aggregate at 3.5%. In contrast, the Communist (Second
World) countries typically grew at between 0% and 2%, accounting for 23% of GWP.
Experience in the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly
industrializing countries generally maintaining their rapid growth, and many
others struggling with debt, inflation, and inadequate investment. The year
1989 ended with remarkable political upheavals in the Communist
countries, which presumably will dislocate economic production still further.
The addition of nearly 100 million people a year to an already overcrowded
globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution, desertification,
underemployment, and poverty throughout the 1990s.

Economy
Overview: The low level of domestic industry and agriculture make North
Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
deficits are made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and foreign
aid. Once self-sufficient in food production, the YAR is now a major importer.
Land once used for export crops--cotton, fruit, and vegetables--has been turned
over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis that has no
significant export market. Oil export revenues started flowing in late 1987
and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.

Economy
Overview: The PDRY is one of the poorest Arab countries, with a
per capita GNP of about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely
dispersed population, and an arid climate make economic development
difficult. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3%
since the mid-1970s. The economy is organized along socialist lines,
dominated by the public sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a
lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over production
decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.

Economy
Overview: Tito's reform programs 20 years ago changed the Stalinist
command economy to a decentralized semimarket system but a system that
the rigid, ethnically divided political structure ultimately could not
accommodate. A prominent feature of the reforms was the establishment
of workers' self-management councils in all large plants, which were to
select managers, stimulate production, and divide the proceeds. The
general result of these reforms has been rampant wage-price inflation,
substantial rundown of capital plant, consumer shortages, and a still
larger income gap between the poorer southern regions and the relatively
affluent northern provinces of Hrvatska and Slovenija. In 1988-89 the
beleaguered central government has been reforming the reforms, trying
to create an open market economy with still considerable state
ownership of major industrial plants. These reforms have been moving
forward with the advice and support of the International Monetary Fund
through a series of tough negotiations. Self-management supposedly is
to be replaced by the discipline of the market and by fiscal austerity,
ultimately leading to a stable dinar. However, strikes in major plants,
hyperinflation, and interregional political jousting have held back
progress. According to US economic advisers, only a highly unlikely
combination of genuine privatization, massive Western economic
investment and aid, and political moderation can salvage this economy.

Economy
Overview: In 1988, in spite of large mineral resources and one of the most
developed and diversified economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire had
a GDP per capita of $195, one of the lowest on the continent. Agriculture,
a key sector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates
under 30% of GDP. The main impetus for economic development has been the
extractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for about
one-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings. During the period
1983-88 the economy experienced slow growth, high inflation, a rising foreign
debt, and a drop in foreign exchange earnings. Recent increases in foreign
prices for copper--a key export earner--and other minerals offer some hope of
reversing the economic decline. Zaire is the world's largest producer of
diamonds.

Economy
Overview: Despite temporary growth in 1988, the economy has been in
decline for more than a decade with falling imports and growing foreign
debt. Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop in copper production
and ineffective economic policies. In 1988 real GDP stood only slightly
higher than that of 10 years before, while an annual population growth of
more than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25% during the same
period. A high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's economic woes in
recent years.

Economy
Overview: Agriculture employs a majority of the labor force and supplies
almost 40% of exports. The agro-based manufacturing sector produces a variety
of goods and contributes about 25% to GDP. Mining accounts for only 5% of both
GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals account for about 40%
of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in agricultural production
over the past six years resulted in not only an uneven growth rate, but
one that did not equal the 3% annual increase in population.
