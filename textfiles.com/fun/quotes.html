"While I was in Ann Arbor I heard that Boston was a good place to
play acoustic music because they still had plenty of clubs.  So I
moved to Cambridge.  I roomed with a Harvard student.  I got an
apartment the first day I got to town by going to Harvard
housing, so I could get cheaper rates, $80 a month or something. 
I even went to some Harvard classes, just to sit in, because I
enjoyed the performance of the professors.  The teachers were
always so theatrical at Harvard, intelligent show business
people, that could keep your attention, and that I think, is the
great advantage of Harvard.  So I used to go for the show, no
matter what subject it was.  You could just drop in to a class
and watch, it wouldn't matter if you went to the school.  No one
even asked.  The show was good and you would learn something, but
you wouldn't get any credit for it.  I didn't need the credit."

"He loved to ask his mother questions.  It was the pleasantest
thing for him to ask a question and then to hear what answer his
mother would give.  Bambi was never surprised that question after
question should come into his mind continually and without
effort.  He found it perfectly natural, and it delighted him very
much.  It was very delightful too, to wait expectantly till the
answer came.  If it turned out the way he wanted, he was
satisfied.  Sometimes, of course, he did not understand, but that
was pleasant also because he was kept busy picturing what he had
not understood, in his own way.  Sometimes he felt very sure that
his mother was not giving him a complete answer, was
intentionally not telling him all she knew.  And, at first, that
was very pleasant, too.  For then there would remain in him such
a lively curiosity, such suspicion, mysteriously and joyously
flashing through him, such anticipation, that he would become
anxious and happy at the same time, and grow silent."  (Bambi 20-

once heard a story about a monastery on the top of some mountain
in Japan or somewhere.  After a long trek in the cold to get
there, the monks would offer to sell you a cup of coffee.  You

his own rules, an actor on a motorcycle, a soldier of fortune
with explosive bow and arrow, or a rock star in leather jacket

"I can't believe I'm having this conversation... With you! 
You've probably never read a book in your life that wasn't
written by John Grisham.  You don't get it.  People like you are
so content to write-off English.  English just isn't about
analysing stories -- if it was, I wouldn't be like this. 
Stories, novels, whatever... reflect something about the
writer... and the culture... and the society that it came from. 
It's a mirror -- a mirror to ourselves.  And when we do it right,
when we just get it, we know something about ourselves.  English
is an understanding of the self.  If we can see ourselves
clearly, we know the right decision to make.  And if you don't
know who you are and make the wrong choices, what good is it if
you can make two-hundred and fifty thousand?" (The Open Door)

"Let me tell you something.  We're all guilty of something. 
Cruelty or greed or going sixty-five in a fifty-five mile per
hour zone.  But you know what?  You want to think of yourself as
the fair haired choir boy, you go ahead. ... I'm saying you've
got a darkness inside of you.  You've got to know the darker,
uglier sides of yourself.  You've got to recognize them so
they're not constantly sneaking up on you.  You've got to love
them because they're a part of you, because along with your
virtues, they make you who you are.  Virtue isn't virtue unless
it slams up against vice so, consequently, your virtue is not
real virtue until it's been tested... and tempted."

"A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys
to fit our locks.  When we feel safe enough to open the locks,
our truest selves step out and we can be completely and honestly
who we are; we can be loved for who we are and not for who we're
pretending to be.  Each unveils the best part of the other.  No
matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we're
safe in our own paradise.  Our soulmate is someone who shares our
deepest longings, our sense of direction.  When we're two
balloons, and together our direction is up, chances are we've
found the right person.  Our soulmate is the one who makes life
come to life." (Bridge 265)

each other.  The sum of one and one, if they're the right ones,
can be infinity!  But so often one person drags the other down;

people, if a woman and a man both wanted to go up like balloons!"

it's a poor exchange for losing your self.  People do go back,
but they don't survive, because two realities are claiming them
at the same time.  Such things are too much.  You can salt your
heart, or kill your heart, or you can choose between the two
realities.  There is much pain here.  Some people think you can
have your cake and eat it.  The cake goes mouldy and they choke
on what's left.  Going back after a long time will make you mad,
because the people you left behind do not like to think of you
changed, will treat you as they always did, accuse you of being

"Of course that is not the whole story, but that is the way with
stories; we make them what we will.  It's a way of explaining the
universe while leaving the universe unexplained, it's a way of
keeping it all alive, not boxing it into time.  Everyone who
tells a story tells it differently, just to remind us that
everybody sees it differently.  Some people say there are true
things to be found, some people say all kinds of things can be
proved.  I don't believe them.  The only thing for certain is how
complicated it all is, like string full of knots.  It's all there
but hard to find the beginning and impossible to fathom the end. 
The best you can do is admire the cat's cradle, and maybe knot it
up a bit more.  History should be a hammock for swinging and a
game for playing, the way cats play.  Claw it, chew it, rearrange
it and at bedtime it's still a ball of string full of knots. 
Nobody should mind.  Some people make a lot of money out of it. 
Publishers do well, people make a lot of money out of it. 
Publishers do well, children, when bright, can come top.  It's an

notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising
itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they
seemed to embody every human act and thought  that had ascent as
its motive.  It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding
and spreading open.  It had the freedom of release and the
tension of purpose.  It swept space clean and left nothing buy
the joy of an unobstructed effort.  Only a faint echo within the
sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, bu spoke
in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no
ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be.  It was the song
of an immense deliverance."  (Atlas 1072)

"The most important thing to a lot of people, is to belong to
something that's hip or whatever.  To be a part of something
that's not society, just a clique.  And they get real sidetracked
trying to think like everyone else.  They don't realize that you
have to motivate yourself to do things you want to do.  Some
people just like going along for the ride.  And those are the
kind of people I don't get along with too well."

"Once they're on paper, they're gone.  I like to do as much with
the words, as far as image goes, so that it's really left open
for a lot of things, even though I remember a specific impression
of something I had at the time.  I can't say a song is about this
or that; in fact, I wouldn't even want to.  I just prefer to have
people live it anyway they want.  Because it's theirs after that. 
There's nothing I can do about it anymore."

"To be under pressure is inescapable.  Pressure takes place
through all the world; war, siege, the worries of state.  We all
know men who grumble under these pressures and complain.  They
are cowards.  They lack splendour.  But there is another sort of
man who is under the same pressure but does not complain, for it
is the friction which polishes him.  It is the pressure which
refines and makes him noble."

"It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how
the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have
done better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in
the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat; who strives
valiantly; who errs and may fail again, because there is no
effort without error or shortcoming, but who does actually strive
to do the deeds; who does know the great enthusiasm, the great
devotion; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best,
knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at
worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that
his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know
neither victory nor defeat."

"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means
the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of
giving much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to
share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender

despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief
and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not
healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that
is a friend who cares."

"I sometimes react to making a mistake as if I have betrayed
myself.  My fear of making a mistake seems to be based on the
hidden assumption that I am potentially perfect and that if I can
just be very careful I will not fall from heaven.  But a
'mistake' is a declaration of the way I am, a jolt to the way I
intend, a reminder I am not dealing with the facts.  When I have

Nothing will have meaning 'ultimately.'  Nothing will even mean
tomorrow what it did today.  Meaning changes with the context.

someone today.  It is enough that I make a difference now."

three things about him.  We know he got on the bicycle and

off.  Most important of all, we know that if at any point between
the beginning and the end of his journey he stops moving and does
not get off the bicycle he will fall off it.  That is a metaphor
for the journey through life of any living thing, and I think of
any society of living things."

life, to seek shape and control.  Even after death, most
particularly after death, the search continues.  Burial rites are
an attempt to complete the scheme, in ritual.  Picture a state
funeral.  It is all precision, detail, order, design.  The nation
holds its breath.  The efforts of a huge and powerful government
are brought to bear on a ceremony that will shed the last trace

told that he should not kill, and he did not kill, until he got
into the Army.  Then he was told to kill, and he killed.  He

"Over the last decade or so 'wars' have been proclaimed, in turn,
on teen pregnancy, dropping out, drugs, and most recently
violence.  The trouble with such campaigns, though, is that they
come too late, after the targeted problem has reached epidemic
proportions and taken firm root in the lives of the young.  They
are crisis intervention, the equivalent of solving a problem by
sending an ambulance to the rescue rather than giving an
inoculation that would ward off the disease in the first place. 
Instead of more such 'wars,' what we need is to follow the logic
of prevention, offering our children the skills for facing life
that will increase their chances of avoiding any and all of these

she had made a mistake that night, and she knew when he said the

she felt strangely healed, as if simply speaking her mistake were
enough to purge some of the pain of it.  For the first time,
then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might
be.  It wasn't a matter of confession, penance, and absolution,
like the priests offered.  It was something else entirely. 
Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was

better next time.  On no account brood over your wrongdoing.

do.  On the case.  Put down the murder.  The work itself is the

those that can no longer speak for themselves.  And you're not

do?  We grab a little something from one year in the fifties and

nothing.  We're all copycats."

of the lives of others.  Just as there are no contradictions in
my values and no conflicts among my desires -- so there are no
victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men, men who
do not desire the unearned and do not view one another with a
cannibal's lust, men who neither make sacrifice nor accept them."

"Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal
and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a
value if obtained by fraud -- that an attempt to gain a value by
deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to
a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn of their
blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions,
while their intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness
become the enemies you have to dread and flee -- that you do not
care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the
stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the
fools he succeeds in fooling -- that honesty is not a social
duty, not a sacrifice for the sake of others, but the most
profoundly selfish virtue man can practice:  his refusal to
sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded
consciousness of others."  (Atlas 937)

"My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single
axiom:  existence exists -- and in a single choice:  to live. 
The rest proceeds from these.  To live, man must hold three
things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:  Reason --
Purpose -- Self-esteem.  Reason, as his only tool of knowledge --
Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must
proceed to achieve -- Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty
that his mind is competent to think and his person is worth of
happiness, which means:  is worthy of living.  These three values
imply and require all of man's virtues, and all his virtues
pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: 
rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice,
productiveness, pride."  (Atlas 936)

"You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need
no morality on a desert island -- it is on a desert island that
he would need it most.  Let him try to claim, when there are no
victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, that sand is
clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or
effort, that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his
stock seed today -- and reality will wipe him out, as he
deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be bought
and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it."

"A rational process is a moral process.  You may make an error at
any step of it, with nothing to protect you but your own
severity, or you may try to cheat, to fake the evidence and evade
the effort of the quest -- but if devotion to the truth is the
hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more
heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the
responsibility of thinking."  (Atlas 935)

"No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your own
mind that has to acquire it.  It is only with your own knowledge
that you can deal.  It is only your own knowledge that you can
claim to possess or ask others to consider.  Your mind is your
only judge of truth -- and if others dissent from your verdict,
reality is the court of final appeal.  Nothing but a man's mind
can perform that complex, delicate, crucial process of
identification which is thinking.  Nothing can direct the process
but his own judgement.  Nothing can direct his judgement but his
moral integrity."  (Atlas 935)

"But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of
irrational whims.  Just as man is free to attempt to survive in
any random manner, but will perish unless he lives as his nature
requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless
fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless
he seeks the happiness proper to man.  The purpose of morality is
to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and
live."  (Atlas 932)

"For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those

that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven

sake of incompetents on earth.  And no one came to say that your
life belongs to you and that the good is to live it."  (Atlas

nothing held any shape at all, and you could poke your finger

"Did you ask me to name man's motive power?  Man's motive power
is his moral code.  Ask yourself where their code is leading you
and what it offers you as your final goal.  A viler evil than to
murder a man, is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue.  A
viler evil than to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace, is to
demand that he leap in, of his own will, and that he build the
furnace, besides.  By their own statement, it is they who need
you and have nothing to offer you in return.  By their own
statement, you must support them because they cannot survive
without you.  Consider the obscenity of offering their impotence
and their need -- their need of you -- as a justification for
your torture.  Are you willing to accept it?  Do you care to
purchase -- at the price of your great endurance, at the price of
you agony -- the satisfaction of the needs of your own
destroyers?"  (Atlas 423-4)

scorned for all those qualities of character which are your
highest pride.  You have been called selfish for the courage of
acting on your own judgement and bearing sole responsibility for
your own life.  You have been called arrogant for your
independent mind.  You have been called cruel for your unyielding
integrity.  You have been called anti-social for the vision that
made you venture upon undiscovered roads.  You have been called
ruthless for the strength and self-discipline of your drive to
your purpose.  You have been called greedy for the magnificence

who've created abundance where there had been nothing but
wastelands and helpless, starving men before you, have been
called a robber.  You, who've kept them all alive, have been
called an exploiter.  You, the purest and most moral man among

that this is not the age for beautiful gestures.  We're after

real trick, and you'd better get wise to it.  There's no way to
rule innocent men.  The only power any government has is the
power to crack down on criminals.  Well, when there aren't enough
criminals, one makes them.  One declares so many things to be a
crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking
laws.  Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens?  What's there
in that for anyone?  But just pass the kind of laws that can
neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted --
and you create a nation of law-breakers -- and then you case in

"That woman and all those like her keep evading the thoughts

yourself to consider anything that would spare you.  They indulge
their emotions at any cost.  You sacrifice your emotions as the
first cost of any problem.  They are willing to bear nothing. 
You are willing to bear anything.  They keep evading
responsibility.  You keep assuming it.  But don't you see that
the essential error is the same?  Any refusal to recognize
reality, for any reason whatever, has disastrous consequences. 
There are no evil thoughts except one:  the refusal to think.

their cause.  There is a limit to how much you should have to
bear."  (Atlas 389)

power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the
effort of the best among men.  It's the person who would sell his
soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of

are willing to work for it.  They know they are able to deserve

"Money is your means of survival.  The verdict you pronounce upon

existence.  Did you get your money by fraud?  By pandering to

hope of getting more than your ability deserves?  By lowering
your standards?  By doing work you despise for purchasers your
scorn?  If so, then your money will not give you a moment's or a
penny's worth of joy.  Then all the things you buy will become,
not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a
reminder of shame.  Then you'll scream that money is evil.  Evil,
because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect?  Evil,
because it would not let you enjoy your depravity?  Is this the
root of your hatred of money?"  (Atlas 384)

"Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth --
the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he
started.  If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if
not, it destroys him.  But you look on and you cry that money
corrupted him.  Did it?  Or did he corrupt his money?  Do not
envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have
done no better with it.  Do not think that it should have been
distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites
instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was
the fortune.  Money is a living power that dies without its root. 
Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it.  Is this the
reason why you call it evil?"  (Atlas 384)

"But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of
the weak?  What strength do you mean?  It is not the strength of
guns or muscles.  Wealth is the product of man's capacity to
think.  Then is money made by the mad who invents a motor at the
expense of those who did not invent it?  Is money made by the
intelligent at the expense of the fools?  By the able at the
expense of the incompetent?  By the ambitious at the expense of
the lazy?  Money is made -- before it can be looted or mooched --
made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his
ability.  An honest man is one who knows that he can't consume
more than he has produced."  (Atlas 383)

free.  The sounds were like a voice saying:  There is no
necessity for pain -- why, then, is the worst pain reserved for
those who will not accept its necessity?  -- we who hold the love
and the secret of joy, to what punishment have we been sentenced

complaints, those unceasing accusations about his indifference? 
Why that chronic air of suspicion, as if they were waiting to be

felt their defensive, reproachful expectation; they seemed
wounded by anything he said, it was not a matter of his words or

"When an actor is in the moment, he or she is engaged in
listening for the next right thing creatively.  When a painter is
painting, he or she may begin with a plan, but that plan is soon
surrendered to the painting's own plan.  This is often expressed
as 'The brush takes the next stroke.'  In dance, in composition,
in sculpture, the experience is the same:  we are more the
conduit than the creator of what we express."

"Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is
necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is
destructive.  In the middle category, however -- that of the
unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury,
exuberance, etc."

"They did not use swords, or keep slaves.  They were not
barbarians.  I do not know the rules and laws of their society,
but I suspect that they were singularly few.  As they did without
monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock
exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. 
Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet
shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians.  They were not less
complex than us.  The trouble is that we have a bad habit,
encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness
as something rather stupid.  Only pain is intellectual, only evil
interesting.  This is the treason of the artist:  a refusal to
admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.  If
you can't lick 'em, join 'em.  If it hurts, repeat it.  But to
praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to
lose hold of everything else.  We have almost lost hold, we can
no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. 
How can I tell you about the people of Omelas?  They were not
naive and happy children -- though their children were, in fact
happy.  They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose
lives were not wretched."

"It's no wonder that our priorities got screwed up.  Just because
a person can throw a ball harder or hit it further than most
ordinary human beings, he is placed on a pedestal at an early
age.  I don't think there is anything wrong with admiring an
exceptionally skilled person, but the hero-worship we shower on
athletes goes beyond that.  This is a part of the tribal
influence handed down by our ancestors.  Man has always been
lionized for his physical prowess.  An Indian brave did not have
to pass a math quiz in order to become a chief, he just had to
tear the ass of some bear.  And the twelve labours of Hercules
did not include a Regents' exam.  Society has tended to find its
heroes in the most obvious arenas, and I don't regard that as a
healthy thing.  We should find our heroes in the bathroom mirror

to take an edge off stress, I don't see a problem.  Trouble

or when you believe its promises of immortality.  You realize
that no matter how much you punish yourself, you always seem to
wake up the next day.  Pretty soon you're convinced that you will
never die.  What that happens I guess it is time to look for help

"During those moments on the pitching rubber, when you have every
pitch at your command working to its highest potential, you are
your own universe.  For hours after the game, this sense of
completeness lingers.  Then you sink back to what we humorously
refer to as reality.  Your body aches and your muscles cry out. 
You feel your mortality.  That can be a difficult thing to
handle.  I believe pitchers come in touch with death a lot sooner
than other players.  We are more aware of the subtle changes
taking place in our body and are unable to overlook the tell-tale
hints that we are not going to last on this planet forever. 
Every pitcher has to be a little bit in love with death.  There's
a subconscious fatalism there."

people on the back enough, letting them know that being able to
fix a sink is just as much skill as being able to get Rod Carew
out with the bases loaded.  And more worthwhile, if you were to
ask me.  People must be made to feel their value.  Otherwise,
when they discover they can't find  any thrills in religion or in
cults, they head out to the ballpark, seeking a vicarious sense
of fulfilment.  They're tired of long-term reality; they don't
recognize what it has to offer them.  All they want is one good
fantasy.  Realizing that really shook me up."

audience.  The 'true' story is not the one that exists in my
mind; it is certainly not the written words on the bound paper
that you hold in your hands.  The story in my mind is nothing but
a hope; the text of the story is the tool I created in order to
try to make that hope a reality.  The story itself, the true
story, is the one that the audience members create in their
minds, guided and shaped by my text, but then transformed,
elucidated, expanded, edited, and clarified by their own
experience, their own desires, their own hopes and fears."

didn't hate it.  I didn't hate it.  Those rules made me feel

"You wish to see the distant realms?  Very well.  But know this
first, the places you will visit, the places you will see, do not
exist.  For there are only two worlds -- your world, which is the
real world, and other worlds, the fantasy.  Worlds like this one,
worlds of the human imagination.  Their reality, or lack of
reality is not important.  What is important is that they are
there.  These worlds provide an alternative.  Provide an escape. 
Provide a threat.  Provide a dream, and power, provide refuge and
pain.  They give your world meaning.  They do not exist; and thus
they are all that matters.  Do you understand?"

"The red flame flickers on the wall of the cave
 (smeared with ochre, berry dye, charcoal)
 Making the great elk move,
 Making the mastodon breath,
 Making the hunters race and kill.

 Watch them seeking to placate and understand the world above
 This they know.
 This they understand.
 There is darkness, everywhere, outside.

 The dark is everywhere; and though the sun comes up,
 And though the fires blossom and are tamed,
 The darkness is there,
 The darkness is waiting.

 As the things in the darkness
 That whisper before they feast,
 They are to be placated and persuaded,
 They are to be loved and sacrificed to,
 They are to be prayed to and distrusted.

 And so there is magic."

"Death is but a stepping over, a passage through the Shroud.  The
moment of death is a rite of passage marking the end of one
journey and the beginning of another, a path available to us at
any time.

The thousands of things undone, the millions of roads not
travelled, the longings and regrets; they do not die with the
body.  Instead they linger on and take a life of their own.  They
become ghosts.  They become shadows.

Trapped between this world and the next, wraiths are lost in the
immortal gloom of damnation.  Held together out of pure misery,
they are trapped by their past, their longings and their fear. 
Many are the products of sudden, violent or cruel deaths.  They
are bound by a sense of crucial deeds undone, of unsaid words
breaking in their hearts, of a life cut short by Fate.  Others
are consumed by a tragic longing for happiness and fulfilment
denied them in life.  A few are driven by bitterness, anger or
passionate ideals."

 I kiss good-bye the howling beast
 That separated you from me
 You'll never know the hurt I suffered
 Nor the pain I rise above
 And I'll never know the same about you,

 In the clasp of oblivion."

"The conquest of the fear of death is the recovery of life's joy. 
One can experience an unconditional affirmation of life only when
one has accepted death, not as contrary to life, but as an aspect

nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, from the hate and fear, the pain
and bitterness, the shadow within.  Hope is fragile and few have
the courage, the passion, to face death, and say, 'I do not go

no hell and seeks no heaven, save that which he and others
created on earth.  He willingly accepts the world that exists on
this side of the grave as the place for moral struggle and
creative living.  He seeks the life abundant for his neighbour as
for himself.  He is content to live one world at a time and let
the next life -- if such there may be -- take care of itself.  He
need not deny immortality; he simply is not interested.  His

soldiers to recycling plants.  A smart rocket can come from a
thousand klicks away to kill you; it doesn't care and it won't be
in the least upset that it has blasted you to atomic debris.

You should be sprayed with his blood, you should be able to hear

mean he could take it as a given.  A man needed only one fatal

soothing.  But somewhere deep inside she feels empty now.  She
has no reason.  No meaning.  No soul.  But your soul lives.

 Its passing leaving my body a cold, darkened shell.

 Your trembling flesh touches its red warmth.
