

        The Impossible Pickup



Place a dime or penny on a bar or table
and place your hand over it.  You
quickly raise your hand and close it
into a fist.  The coin is in your palm.
Yet when someone else tries it, the coin
remains on the table.

The secret: Put your hand on the coin so
that the coin rests on the ball of your
hand just below the third finger.  Now
just before you lift it, press down hard
and quickly lift your hand.  The
pressure will cause the coin to stick to
your palm just long enough to grab it as
you lift your hand and close your fist.
