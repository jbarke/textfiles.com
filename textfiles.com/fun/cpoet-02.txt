Like a child who enjoys reading, a cyberpoet will return often to hir
favorite net.repository of information and check for new 'books.' Unlike
everyday reality [ER], there are thousands of libraries and also unlike ER
they are usually less then 100 keystrokes away. No fossil fuel is burned;
they are almost never closed; and the cost of use is minimal, undoubtedly
a few steps in the right direction.

A cyberpoet with a good memory or a handy Personnal Digital Assistant
[PDA](such as a Newton, Sharp, or Intelligent Agent) will often be able to
list off hir favorite net.repositories upon request. However it is often
useful to have a pre-made list of common sites to forward if time is short
or the PDA is without batteries. Consider this such a list.

grow fast.

-=- 02.2.Museums, galleries & stuph   |
---------------------------------------

Every subculture has art it can call it's own. Indeed, some would say that
without art it would not really be a culture at all. The world of
virtual culture is no exception. Civilizations, uncivilized that they are,
have been prone to collecting art in museums, supposedly to make public
viewing easier. The result, however, is that only a few people see this
art every year and the scarcity of this viewing makes the art-world seem
elitist. To some extent, this has been replicated in virutal space.

However, the medium of the net allows for wider distribution and new
spaces for all forms of art. New spaces, even new artforms, pop up all the
time and hopefully find their way into this document. This activity seems
to be both motivated by and motivating a groundswell in popular art and
computer mediated art.

-=- 02.4.Organizations & Gov't      |
-------------------------------------

The internet is international, national and pinpoint local; private,
public, profit, non-profit, all at the same time. This structure makes it
not only unreasonable to impose a government upon the net, but nearly
impossible. So when you talk about Gov't on the net, you are talking about
the Goverment's attempts to reach out to the net.citizens and, ideally, to
listen to them.

-o0 The Legislative Branch 0o-

o Congress Email/FTP
        - mail congress@hr.house.gov and ftp ftp.senate.gov
        - sadly I only found two senators who were using this (Alaska & 
Mass)

o The Congress is in the process of establishing its own electronic public
access links. You can get more information from any of the following.
Please remember that these are not connected in any way to any White
House online projects (due to the separation of powers), so if you have
any problems with their systems, you will have to contact their system
administrators for assistance.

      Senate gopher site:   gopher ftp.senate.gov
         Senate ftp site:   ftp ftp.senate.gov
     Library of Congress:   telnet locis.loc.gov
        "    "      "   :   ftp seq1.loc.gov
        "    "      "   :   gopher marvel.loc.gov
    Government documents:   gopher esusda.gov 
    Government documents:   gopher sunsite.unc.edu

-o0 The Executive Branch 0o-


The official Party Line: "The White House e-mail system is under
construction. This is a new project and suffers from all of the problems
common to a startup operation. The Communications office is currently
working on defining what this system will do, as well as trying to come up
with equipment and staffing to make sure that it works. E-mail messages
are currently being printed out and responses are being sent out via US 
Mail.

"Nobody wants this new venture to work more than the staff that has
devoted so many hours to getting it up and running. But much time and
effort will be required before the system is truly interactive. In the
mean time, they will need a little patience from the electronic community.
If you send a message to the White House, please include a US Post office
address for replies."

On the Internet, send to:
president@whitehouse.gov or vice.president@whitehouse.gov

-o0 Other 0o-

   gopher gopher.voa.gov
      - Voice of America Newsfiles (very very interesting. hm?)

-=- 02.5.Organizations      |
-----------------------------

Home, home on the net. The ability of the Internet to bring people
together who share common interests is amazing. Someone may start a
mailing list to discuss a local environmental problem, then suddenly
someone from halfway around the world joins in and you learn they are
having the same problem as well. Before you know it, the mailing list
becomes a clearing house for information regarding environmental
pollution. That is one sort of organization on the net. Other's join the
net with the explicit intention of operating as an Organization. Both are
growing in numbers everyday.

This is the last time this section will be in the Guide.
