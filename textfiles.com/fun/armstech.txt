Subject: Unauthorised hosting of Jane's Fighting Ships data

Dear Mr Scott,

I bring to your attention that your website (www.textfiles.com) is hosting 
information that is the copyright of IHS Global Limited.

Whilst I understand that the textfiles.com site is not hosting this data 
for any monetary gain you will, I am sure, understand that copyright exists 
over this data and that IHS Global Limited has a strong interest in ensuring
that the data is available only through its own channels and through its own
brands.

The data in question is from the 1990-1991 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships
and can be found in the text file 'armstech.txt', which is located at the
following location on the textfiles.com site, http://www.textfiles.com/fun/
armstech.txt.

As stated earlier, the data held within this file is the copyright of IHS 
Global Limited, owner of the Jane's Fighting Ships publication and brand, 
and is available only to its subscribers; by hosting this data and making it 
free to download you are in breach of international copyright laws.

I therefore ask you, as proprietor of textfiles.com, to remove this data 
from the www.textfiles.com site and any associated mirror sites within the 
next 7 days from the date of this email and confirm your action by reply. 
Failure to take action may result in this matter being placed in the hands 
of the IHS Global Limited legal team and further action being taken 
against you.

Yours sincerely,
David Ward
