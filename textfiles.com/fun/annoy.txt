Isn't it annoying when boards add these damn files to the zips? Well, don't
worry. This is Guido Sanchez, from the BLaH file you are about to delete, and
I was just pointing that out. Some boards, like Gramcracker in 708/312, make
entire fucking DIRECTORIES in the zipfile. Annoying ones with lotsa alt-255s.
And that fucking annoying þ. Is that the size of their asshole or their brain?
Well, in either case, I'd like to find out so I can skewer them using the
proper utensils. I mean, it would be a shame to want to give someone an iron
colonic, and you find out their asshole is bigger than you thought. And me
without my spoon.
