Economy
Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned
economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elements--but
still within the framework of monolithic Communist control. To this
end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility
in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the authority
of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted a wide
variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light manufacturing,
and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint
ventures. The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production,
particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Otherwise, the leadership has
often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism
(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains
and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,
retightening central controls at intervals and thereby undermining the
credibility of the reform process. Open inflation and excess demand continue to
plague the economy, and political repression, following the crackdown at
Tiananmen in mid-1989, has curtailed tourism, foreign aid, and new investment
by foreign firms. Popular resistance and changes in central policy have weakened
China's population control program, which is essential to the nation's long-term
economic viability.

Economy
Overview: Economic activity has slowed gradually since 1986, but
growth rates remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative
economic policies have encouraged investment and kept inflation
and unemployment under 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid development
of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries over the past four
years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices--Colombia's major
export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer
of 1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, and drug-related violence
dampen prospects for future growth.

Economy
Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of
several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly
increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level
of the labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign technical assistance.
Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the leading sector of the
economy. It contributes about 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor
force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in
food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.
During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an annual average rate
of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was less than 4% in 1986. Despite major
investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth
has stagnated since 1983.

Economy
Overview: Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo
to finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5%
annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The world decline in
oil prices, however, has forced the government to launch an austerity
program to cope with declining receipts and mounting foreign debts.

Economy
Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export
earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to
a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories.  Economic development
is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack of
natural resources and good transportation links.  A large trade deficit is
annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid. Current
economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential and
expanding the fishing industry.

Economy
Overview: In 1988 the economy grew at a 3.8% rate, a drop from the
5.1% of the previous year. Gains in agricultural production
(on the strength of good coffee and banana crops) and in construction,
were partially offset by declines in the rates of growth for the industry
and commerce sectors. In 1988 consumer prices rose by nearly 21%
followed by a 10% rise in 1989. Unemployment is officially reported at
about 6%, but much underemployment remains. External debt, on a
per capita basis, is among the world's highest.

Economy
Overview: The Soviet-style economy, centrally planned and largely
state owned, is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign
trade. Sugar provides about 75% of export revenues and is mostly exported
to the USSR and other CEMA countries. The economy has stagnated since
1985 under a program that has deemphasized material incentives in the
workplace, abolished farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices
of government-supplied goods and services. Castro has complained that
the ongoing CEMA reform process has interfered with the regular flow of
goods to Cuba. Recently the government has been trying to increase
trade with Latin America and China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing
its foreign debt since 1982. The government currently is encouraging
foreign investment in tourist facilities. Other investment priorities
include sugar, basic foods, and nickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet
subsidy, a main prop to Cuba's threadbare economy, may be cut in view
of the USSR's mounting economic problems.

Government
Long-form name: Republic of Cyprus

Type: republic; a disaggregation of the two ethnic communities inhabiting
the island began after the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this separation
was further solidified following the Turkish invasion of the island in July
1974, which gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek
Cypriots control the only internationally recognized government; on 15 November
1983 Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktash declared independence and the
formation of a Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which has been recognized
only by Turkey; both sides publicly call for the resolution of intercommunal
differences and creation of a new federal system of government

sector contributes about 55% to GDP and employs 40% of the labor force.
Rapid growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products
and in tourism have played important roles in the average 6% rise in GDP
in recent years. While this growth put considerable pressure on prices
and the balance of payments, the inflation rate has remained low
and the balance-of-payments deficit manageable.

Economy
Overview: Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized and has a
well-educated and skilled labor force. Its industry, transport, energy
sources, banking, and most other means of production are state owned. The
country is deficient, however, in energy and many raw materials.
Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
standards. Industry contributes over 50% to GNP and construction 10%.
About 95% of agricultural land is in collectives or state farms. The
centrally planned economy has been tightly linked in trade (80%) to
the USSR and Eastern Europe. Growth has been sluggish, averaging
less than 2% in the period 1982-89. GNP per capita ranks
next to the GDR as the highest in the Communist countries.
As in the rest of Eastern Europe, the sweeping political changes of
1989 have been disrupting normal channels of supply and compounding
the government's economic problems. Czechoslovakia is beginning
the difficult transition from a command to a market economy.

industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance
to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.

Economy
Overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is highly
vulnerable to climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about 30%
of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include
bananas, coconuts, citrus, and root crops. In 1988 the economy achieved a
5.6% growth in real GDP on the strength of a boost in construction,
higher agricultural production, and growth of the small manufacturing
sector based on soap and garment industries.  The tourist industry
remains undeveloped because of a rugged coastline and the lack of an
international-class airport.

Economy
Overview: The economy is largely dependent on the agricultural sector,
which employs 50% of the labor force and provides about half of export revenues.
The principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cocoa, and
tobacco. Industry is based on the processing of agricultural products, durable
consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Rapid growth of free trade zones has
established a significant expansion of manufacturing for export, especially
wearing apparel. Over the past decade tourism has also increased in importance
and is a significant earner of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs.
Unemployment is officially reported at about 25%, but underemployment may
be much higher.

Economy
Overview: Ecuador continues to recover from a 1986 drop in international
oil prices and a major earthquake in 1987 that interrupted oil exports
for six months and forced Ecuador to suspend foreign debt payments.
In 1988-89 oil exports recovered--accounting for nearly half of
Ecuador's total export revenues--and Quito resumed full interest
payments on its official debt, and partial payments on its commercial
debt. The Borja administration has pursued austere economic
policies that have helped reduce inflation and restore international
reserves. Ecuador was granted an IMF standby agreement worth $135
million in 1989, and Quito will seek to reschedule its foreign
commercial debt in 1990.

government. Overregulation holds back technical modernization and
foreign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late
1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices
and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. As part of
the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the government agreed to institute
a reform program to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and
improve its external position. The reforms have been slow in coming,
however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past
three years. With 1 million people being added every eight months
to Egypt's population, urban growth exerts enormous pressure on
the 5% of the total land area available for agriculture.

Economy
Overview: The economy experienced a modest recovery during the period
1983-86, after a sharp decline in the early 1980s. Real GDP grew by 1.5% a
year on the strength of value added by the manufacturing and service sectors.
In 1987 the economy expanded by 2.5% as agricultural output recovered from the
1986 drought. The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of GDP, employs about 40%
of the labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is the
major commercial crop, contributing 60% to export earnings. The manufacturing
sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 17% of GDP
and 16% of employment. Economic losses due to guerrilla sabotage total more
than $2.0 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large military
seriously constrain the government's ability to provide essential social
services.

products providing income, foreign exchange, and government
revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts
for about 10% of GNP, and the construction, public works, and service
sectors for about 34%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium,
iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.  Oil exploration is
taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms.

Economy
Overview: Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in
Africa. Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for
about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates
over 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on
inputs from the agricultural sector. The economy is centrally planned, and over
90% of large-scale industry is state run. Favorable agricultural weather
largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89.

GDP: $6.6 billion, per capita $130, real growth rate 4.5% (FY89 est.)

Inflation rate (consumer prices): 9.6% (FY89)

Industrial production: growth rate - 0.2% (FY88 est.)

Electricity: 330,000 kW capacity; 700 million kWh produced,
14 kWh per capita (1989)

Industries: cement, textiles, food processing, oil refinery

Agriculture: accounts for 45% of GDP and is the most important sector of
the economy even though frequent droughts, poor cultivation practices, and
state economic policies keep farm output low; famines not uncommon;
export crops of coffee and oilseeds grown partly on state farms;
estimated 50% of agricultural production at subsistence level;
principal crops and livestock--cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseeds,
potatoes, sugarcane, vegetables, hides and skins, cattle, sheep, goats

Aid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-88), $471 million; Western
(non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-87), $2.6 billion;

the islands) with a scroll at the bottom bearing the motto DESIRE THE
RIGHT

Economy
Overview: The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or
indirectly employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet
domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily
those for providing winter fodder. Major sources of income are from the export
of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of stamps and coins. Rich stocks of
fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders, but
development plans called for the islands to have six trawlers by 1989.
In 1987 the government began to sell fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license
fees amount to more than $25 million per year. To encourage tourism, the
Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
visitors who are attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing.

Economy
Overview: The Faroese enjoy the high standard of living
characteristic of the Danish and other Scandinavian economies.
Fishing is the dominant economic activity. It employs over
25% of the labor force, accounts for about 25% of GDP, and
contributes over 80% to export revenues. A handicraft industry
employs about 20% of the labor force. Because of cool summers
agricultural activities are limited to raising sheep and to
potato and vegetable cultivation. There is a labor shortage, and
immigrant workers accounted for 5% of the work force in 1989. Denmark
annually subsidizes the economy, perhaps on the order of 15% of GDP.

Economy
Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large
subsistence sector. Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange
and sugar processing accounts for one-third of industrial output.
Industry, including sugar milling, contributes 10% to GDP. Fiji
traditionally earned considerable sums of hard currency from the 250,000
tourists who visited each year. In 1987, however, after two military
coups, the economy went into decline. GDP dropped by 7.8% in
1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainly created a drop in
tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production
to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously.

Economy
Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market
economy, with per capita output nearly three-fourths the US figure.
Its main economic force is the manufacturing sector--principally
the wood, metals, and engineering industries. Trade is important, with the
export of goods representing about 25% of GNP. Except for timber and
several minerals, Finland depends on imported raw materials, energy, and
some components of manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural
development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic commodities.
Economic prospects are generally bright, the main shadow being the
increasing pressures on wages and prices.

Economy
Overview: One of the world's most developed economies, France
has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern
industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern
technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural
producer in Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural
products and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial
sector generates about one-third of GDP and employs about one-third of the work
force. During the period 1982-86 economic growth was sluggish, averaging
only 1.4% annually. This trend was reversed by late 1987, however,
with a strong expansion of consumer demand, followed by a surge in
investment. The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new

Economy
Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies
and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are
the most important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
(mostly shrimp) accounting for about two-thirds of total revenue in 1985. The
large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding
sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops--rice,
cassava, bananas, and sugarcane--are limited to the coastal area, where the
population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on
imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly
among younger workers, with an unemployment rate of 15%.

Economy
Overview: The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early
1970s, is now dominated by the oil sector. During the period 1981-85 oil
accounted for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government
revenues on average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a
substantial increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand,
reinforced migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real
wages to among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of
Gabon's economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, stabilized
in 1989 because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows.
The agricultural and industrial sectors are relatively underdeveloped,
accounting for only 8% and 10%, respectively, of GDP in 1986.

Economy
Overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
resources and has a limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's
poorest countries with a per capita income of about $250. About 75% of
the population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
contributes about 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing
activity--processing peanuts, fish, and hides--accounts for less than
10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia imports about 33%
of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods. Exports are
concentrated on peanut products (over 75% of total value).

Gaza Strip
Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with
Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President
Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the final status of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned
parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the
respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy
that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be
determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the area
west of the Jordan under Jordanian administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, however,
it is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest
of the West Bank because of the city's special status and circumstances.
Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be
different in character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

same as that of the construction sector, and industry accounts for 7%. Gaza
depends upon Israel for 90% of its imports and as a market for 80% of its
exports. Unrest in the territory in 1988-89 (intifadah) has raised
unemployment and substantially lowered the incomes of the population.

Economy
Overview: The GDR is moving rapidly away from its centrally planned
economy. As the 1990s begin, economic integration with West Germany
appears inevitable, beginning with the establishment of a common
currency. The opening of the border with the FRG in late 1989 and the
continuing emigration of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers had
brought growth to a standstill by yearend 1989. Features of the old
economic regime that will quickly change: (a) the collectivization
of 95% of East German farms; (b) state ownership of nearly all
transportation facilities, industrial plants, foreign trade
organizations, and financial institutions; (c) the 65% share in trade
of the USSR and other CEMA countries; and (d) the detailed control over
economic details exercised by Party and state. Once integrated into
the thriving West German economy, the area will have to stem the
outflow of workers and renovate the obsolescent industrial base. After an

Economy
Overview: West Germany, a major economic power and a leading exporter,
has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent
living standards and comprehensive social welfare benefits. The FRG is
poor in natural resources, coal being the most important
mineral. The FRG's comparative advantage lies in the technologically
advanced production stages. Thus manufacturing and services dominate
economic activity, and raw materials and semimanufactures constitute
a large proportion of imports. In 1988 manufacturing accounted for
35% of GDP, with other sectors contributing lesser amounts.  The major
economic problem in 1989 is persistent unemployment of over 8%. The FRG is well
poised to take advantage of the increasing economic integration of the European
Community. The dramatic opening of the boundary with East Germany in late 1989
poses new economic challenges that could tax even this powerful economy.

Economy
Overview: Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana
has been implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983.
Good harvests in 1988 featured the 6% growth in GNP. Moves toward privatization
and relaxation of government controls continued in 1988-89, although at a
slower-than-expected pace. In 1988 service on the $2.8 billion debt was
equivalent to 75% of export earnings. As Ghana obtains concessional loans
and pays off high-interest debt, however, debt service is expected to fall
below 30% of export earnings in the early 1990s. The economic rebuilding
program has both helped and harmed the manufacturing sector, for example,
by improving the supply of raw materials and by increasing competition from
imports. The long-term outlook is favorable provided that the political
structure can endure the slow pace at which living standards are improving
and can manage the problems stemming from excessive population growth.

Economy
Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a
socialist-left-government that enlarged the public sector and became the
nation's largest employer. Like many other Western economies, Greece
suffered severely from the global oil price hikes of the 1970s, annual
GDP growth plunging from 8% to 2% in the 1980s, and inflation,
unemployment, and budget deficits rising sharply. The fall of the
socialist government in 1989 and the inability of the conservative
opposition to muster a clear majority have led to business uncertainty
and the continued prospects for lackluster economic performance.
Once the political situation is sorted out, Greece will have to face the
challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of the European
Community, including the progressive lowering of tariff barriers. Tourism
continues as a major industry, providing a vital offset to the sizable
commodity trade deficit.

Economy
Overview: Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from
one based on subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on
foreign trade. Fishing is still the most important industry, accounting
for over two-thirds of exports and about 25% of the population's income.
Exploitation of mineral resources is limited to lead and zinc. Maintenance
of a social welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public
sector a dominant role in the economy. Greenland is heavily dependent
on an annual subsidy of about $400 million from the Danish Government.

Economy
Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and
services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
income and social transfers. Tourism is a key industry, with most
tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of
cruise ships visit the islands. The
traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other
crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings),
eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for
local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported
food, which comes mainly from France. Light industry consists mostly of
sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported.
Unemployment is especially high among the young.
