    <B>A MINOR (OR MAJOR) CATASTOPHE</B>
    <P>
    Happens to the best of us; one of my hard drives died and I lost the 
    textfiles.com inbox. 
    <P>
    Huge thing, it was; over 65,000 files of all sorts, many of them binaries
    wrapped next to other file sets. I'd been going through about a thousand 
    every week or so, and was progressing. Probably a third of the sorted 
    files were making it onto the final site.
    <P>
    I'm pretty good at my backups, and this hard drive crash killed little of
    my various projects; for example, textfiles.com is still fine, and the
    BBS Documentary Site is fine, and a host of other files were protected.
    <P>
    But I did lose a lot of stuff that I would like to see again. In the
    case of the inbox, I thought it was being backed up nightly, and it wasn't.
    <P>
    I'm thinking of sending the drive to a place called 
    <A HREF="http://www.drivesavers.com">drivesavers</A>, who basically
    rip apart the drives and suck the data out. They quoted me prices of
    $1300-$3900 to do this. This is a lot of money, money I don't currently
    have.
    <P>
    So, I don't know. I could try a fund-raising drive for this site, like
    I've seen others, to do the data restoration (or to try one). Or I could
    give it up and just assume it's lost.
    <P>
    I'm looking for your opinion. <A HREF="mailto:jason@textfiles.com">Let
    me know.</A>
