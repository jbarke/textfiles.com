rumours are that at&t will be with us by the end of 1993 so where will
this lead us?
well i hear a lot of people talking about the good ole at&t card dying etc
as bt will then comunicate with them and give permission to trace back
card users etc so thats a disadvantage but things arent always one way.how
about the bridges,pbx`s,sys 75,85g3i,85g3r`s and lots to explore on their
new freephone dialups,like mercury they will have a frephone code.
so looks like we will be getting less sleep than before a totally new area
to explore in .
i think this may be a thought for most people but i assure you i would
like to be first to get into there central computer over here...!

Can anyone donate a 50 or 60mb SCSI hard drive to the system? We are now
running with less than 1mb spare and I dont want to take the system down.

I am sure someone must have a spare SCSI drive which they no longer
require.

If you're using BT, you can call the states, forcing the
use of a satellite or sub-sea cable route by dialling:
010-1-83-xxx-xxx-xxxx    Sub-sea cable
010-1-84-xxx-xxx-xxxx    Satellite
.
If you don't force it, you're most likely to get a sat link.
.
Aside: If you use 0100-1-xxx-xxx-xxxx, you'll get an ISDN
digital link, for which you will pay LOADS.
.
I can't say whether you can force Mercury to use cable
or satellite in a similar way.
I guess this info may be of use to some of you....

Re: 010-83-xxx...

Did you also notice that if you route via cable its possible to sieze the
line.. i noticed it a few months ago  and played with it for a while
calling nos in the us i knew to be disconnected .. but have a small
suspicion that thsi was the reasons my lines got filtered about a week
later heh..always knew it was a bad idea to screw with Bt.. foreigncompanie
s are ok as Bt doesnt seem to give a flying fuck about anything but its
own profits..
Just wondering about mercury tho as it is possible to break and dial on
some mercury lines (the a....c routing gives it away heh) but wonder if
its advisable to  do it so close to home..

                                     An 'in-tents' summer congress
.
.
.
H U H?
+-------
.
Remember the Galactic Hacker Party back in 1989? Ever wondered what
happened to the people behind it? We sold out to big business, you
think. Think again, we're back!
.
That's right. On august 4th, 5th and 6th 1993, we're organising a
three-day summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers,
computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards, networkers,
hardware freaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies,
cyberpunks, system managers, stupid users, paranoid androids, Unix
gurus, whizz kids, warez dudes, law enforcement officers (appropriate
undercover dress required), guerilla heating engineers and other
assorted bald, long-haired and/or unshaven scum. And all this in the
middle of nowhere (well, the middle of Holland, actually, but that's
the same thing) at the Larserbos campground four metres below sea
level.
.
The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops
on hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual
reality, semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking, viruses,
paranoia, legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and elsewhere and
much, much more. English will be the lingua franca for this event,
although some workshops may take place in Dutch. There will be an
Internet connection, an intertent ethernet and social interaction
(both electronic and live). Included in the price are four nights in
your own tent. Also included are inspiration, transpiration, a
shortage of showers (but a lake to swim in), good weather (guaranteed
by god), campfires and plenty of wide open space and fresh air. All of
this for only 100 dutch guilders (currently around US$70).
.
We will also arrange for the availability of food, drink and smokes of
assorted types, but this is not included in the price. Our bar will be
open 24 hours a day, as well as a guarded depository for valuables
(like laptops, cameras etc.). You may even get your stuff back! For
people with no tent or air mattress: you can buy a tent through us for
100 guilders, a mattress costs 10 guilders. You can arrive from 17:00

(that's five p.m. for analogue types) on August 3rd. We don't have to
vacate the premises until 12:00 noon on Saturday, August 7 so you can
even try to sleep through the devastating Party at the End of Time
(PET) on the closing night (live music provided). We will arrange for
shuttle buses to and from train stations in the vicinity.

.
Payment: In advance only. Even poor techno-freaks like us would like
to get to the Bahamas at least once, and if enough cash comes in we
may just decide to go. So pay today, or tomorrow, or yesterday, or in
any case before Friday, June 25th 1993. Since the banks still haven't
figured out why the Any key doesn't work for private international
money transfers, you should call, fax or e-mail us for the best way to
launder your currency into our account. We accept American Express,
even if they do not accept us. But we are more understanding than they
are. Foreign cheques go directly into the toilet paper recycling bin
for the summer camp, which is about all they're good for here.
.
.
H A !

.
Very Important: Bring many guitars and laptops.
.
.
M E ?
+-----
.
Yes, you! Busloads of alternative techno-freaks from all over the
planet will descend on this event. You wouldn't want to miss that,
now, would you?
.
Maybe you are part of that select group that has something special to
offer! Participating in 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' is
exciting, but organising your very own part of it is even more fun. We
already have a load of interesting workshops and lectures scheduled,
but we're always on the lookout for more. We're also still in the
market for people who want to help us organize this during the
congress.
.
In whatever way you wish to participate, call, write, e-mail or fax us
soon, and make sure your money gets here on time. Space is limited.

Thinking about it, it would be fairly easy to produce a decent UK version
of 2600/Mondo2000 etc. with the knowledge of the various people on this
board. I have been thinking about this for a while and I am really
interested in giving it a try. Stuff like cyberpunk, drugs, hacking,
phreaking, technology, etc. should appeal to all the sexually frustrated
teenagers with a lot of time in their hands ( :-) ).
Anyone interested?

For your latest copy of BTs business news magazine, ring 0800 800 855 and
ask for one.
For some reason, there was a copy waiting for me when I got home this
weekend, I wonder why.
Its a conspiracy you see, theyre all after me, I know too much about the
multi purpose assault hairdriers, wheres my tablets where my tablets where
my tablet frbivle ehkjenol;e enjlkhelm dgfuydl.e xhoiejdm
Only joking...
.
.
.
.
or am I?
Anyway, they contain a load of wank about latest BT products etc., but
there is information which could prove usually to a decent social engineer
and special offers, details of BT fairs (worth going to if you hapopen to
be of the shoplifter persuasion) and loads of other shit like that...
laters folks
