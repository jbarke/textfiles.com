I agree with you, Anyone Connected with child porn should be Hung +
Quartered! Although i have never come across any bbs's that have that sort
of sick and degrading crap on them, there must be quite a few out there,
maybe the hackers/phreakers of the U.K should unite and make sure all
these bbs's are shutdown (maybe due to line trouble!!), Or maybe not but i
certainly think that its sick!!

When exactly was the 'computer porn' Cook Report screened? I notice 'The
Deceptor' hasn't logged on since 1:34am on July the 20th. I guess he was
busted within days of this logon. His account has been removed from UABBS
for security reasons.

Yeah .. That Cook Report si pretty good .. and I agree child porn should
be stopped 'cos it is the lowest form of data around .. 
  apparently that cook bloke did a program featuring an atomic bomb in a
briefcase which was on the black market in Russia and got over here ..
anyone know what else they went on about on that program .. ??!!??

Whats happ'n to the Uk scene ?? We have only a handfull of HP boards, this

still in the pipeline and BOOTs isnt aval yet (is this right?), when I
move house I hope to fuck I'm allowed to run my BBS again, this time it
will be 14.4k, and I already have a large filebase of about 1,500 files.
In the US there are millions of them (non-WaReZ) some are shite but a
handfull kick ass, I'm also into viruses, is there any virus groups in the
Uk or was "it" ARCV ??? I'd like to know the volume of calls that I "hope"
to get when I set mine up ...I dont want the lamer or warez dewds but
knowledgable users ... How many quality users tare there in here ???
About 10 I'd say (not including me), BOOT/Phantasm/The Grim reaper and a
few others I cant remember ... Come on lets kick ass, the yanks are

The cook report on the "RED MERCURY" was really good, He traced red
mercury (used in making N-BOMBS the size of Tennis balls!), all the way
from russia  to a car salesman in san fransisco.
Apparentely it is also used in the production of stealth technology. so
there is a big market for the stuph. Makes the anarchists cookbook look
like a kiddies bedtime story...

After the workshop on "Hacking Plastics" (the one where we had to chase
SuperChannel film-crew away ;) ), I talked with two dudes from New York. I
believe one of them was The Raven after I saw the note on the notice
board. And yes, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe) - editor of Phrack - was
also present. I had a litlle chat with him about those blinking LED's that
are supposed to sync your braion waves or sumtin'. Chris told me it
actually works though I still have a lot of doubts. I dunno about Wau
Holland. I know there were a lot of CCC people there but I heard nothing
about Wau.

I dunno how it is in the UK but here in Belgium the Telco doesn't really
care about it as long as THEY don't suffer any losses. I've heared that
the German telco has a similar attitude though it is possible that they
get a lot of pressure from AT&T or MCI. The most logical result of this
pressure so far is that the Telco will make a technical adjustement that
prevents BB. But then there are still all those South-American and Asian
countries of course :)
Also, I've never heared anything about people being busted for BB in
Europe. 
 
Anyway, as a hacker and phreak you know you're dealing with 'risky' stuff.
Just keep covering your ass but don't quit.

To box off Brazil you need a CLEAR tone to clear the filter off the line.
Then you can send the break and call inttionally quite easily. I know this
is possible as I used to BB of brazil with the old tones. I tried for a
month to get another CLEAR tone buno such luck.

Also Has Anyone had a good Alliance conference lately, havent had a good
long chatty/interesting conference in ages, Last one was back before
christmas with a few of the german guys (Black Death. etc etc), Isn't it

Hmm the only way i know to rip off vending machines is u cAN rip off Pepsi
machines with a pound coin with a hole in it and a piece of fishing wire,
what you do is drill a hole in the pound coin and then tie the fishing
wire through the whole, then when you drop the coin in you pull it back
out (Quickly, but not to hard or u lose your buck!). 
then you should be able to press refund and get your pound back (well
someone elses!), or have a can of pepsi and keep the change..

Can you get the phone # for M. P. Supplies? And do you know how much a
lockpick set, a lockpick gun, and a tubular lockpick is? I started out
with lockpicking when I was sstill very very young but it didn't last that
long. However, the workshop at the HEU-congress got me interested again.
But I guess i'm not the only one :)

Hmm well I can try and find a phone number if you want...
Lockguns are about Uk 60, pick sets vary quite a bit and tubular locks are
damn expensive for what they actually are...
If enpough people are interested I will transcribe a complete price list
on the lock stuff these people do...

Well as I mentioned to various people at the conf (and BTW, I can`t
imagine why people thought they were being original wearing 2600 and
hacktic t-shirts, they looked like geeks to me), it seems foolish to
wander around in hacker clothes because this needlessly lets people/feds
etc. know what you`re into, which isn`t always a good idea.
Personally, it will be a cold day in hell before I walk down the high
street in a hacker t-shirt...

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one. 

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
