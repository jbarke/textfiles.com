THE INTERACTIVE HELP SYSTEM

This is the interactive help system, which hopefully will contain answers to
any of the questions you're likely to ask about using the software archive.

If you type just the command "help", you'll see this section as the first
display. At the end of the text, the help system will give you a list of
sub-topics, and invite you to choose one. Type in the name of the topic and
press return, and you'll move down to the next level. This may also have
sub-topics which you can visit, and so on.

As well as giving the name of a sub-topic to go down to a lower level, you can
also move back up to where you were before: you do this by pressing only RETURN
in answer to the prompt.  You'll then be reminded of what other sub-topics
there are to choose.

You can also quit at any time by replying "q" to the prompt and pressing
RETURN.

You can always enter the help system in this way, and you can navigate up and
down the system to the bit you want. After a while you might find this a bit
tiresome, so the system lets you go directly to a sub-topic if you wish.

You do this by naming the sub-topics on the way to where you want to go. As an
example, suppose you want to look up the page on the "dir" command. If you were
navigating one stage at a time, you'ld go from this current topic to the
"commands" sub-topic, and from there to the "dir" sub-topic. To get there
directly, you would type

               help commands dir

in the command line.

To help you work out these "route maps", the top line of every display gives
you the command you would type to get directly to the topic. Thus, if the top
line shows

              help basics where indexes

then that's the exact command you type to get directly to that information.

You can if you wish abbreviate the topics you name to any degree, provided that
what you give can be unambiguously identified; thus you could write the above
command as

              help b whe i

Hopefully you'll find the system easy to use, as each sub-topic in a list has
some text to say what it's about. For newcomers to the system, we suggest you
go next to the "basics" sub-topic of this page, which will start you off with
essential information. If what you need is an idea of the commands you can use
here, go to the "commands" sub-topic.

If you want to acquire the help information by FTP, you'll find it provided in
human-readable form in a number of files in directory "help". For an up-to-date
list of what's available, FTP the file "help/00contents".
