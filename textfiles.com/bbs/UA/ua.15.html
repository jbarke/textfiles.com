Apparantly,so says a BT engineer,if you dial your number and then add the
next number on,making the two last numbers add up to 10 then the call if
free.  e.g..say you usually dial 555533,then dial 555533(7) 3+7=10.........

break it but i can't even figure out which country it is...Also, I am
almost certain there ]+}are ways to call off TURKEY (890090) just listen
to the echo on this sucker! and Greece (cc 357)...both sound VERY
interesting! And inceland is breakable again (890354) so play with that

Right, umm couple of places I think, you can get 'complete solutions'
(ie expensive) from PK electronics in Kingston, for less money try
Lorraine Electronics (london) who also trade as Ruby electronics,
phone number for Ruby is probably in the Phone book, I have a number for
PK also, will post if needed.

NB Ruby stuff is much cheaper, and much of it is made by the same
workshops as PK.

Hmmm well, I've scanned most of 89 already..there's nothing great...I
guess i can let those of you who haven't experimented a lot into a little
secret..the 0800 89 prefix is NOT the only prefix that connects you with
foreign countries, you might wanna try 0800 96x xxx, most stuff only up to
963 xxx, there's some cool shit there, inc. loads of voicemail, unix
carriers etc. (BUT I've hacked them all! hahaha)

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one.

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
