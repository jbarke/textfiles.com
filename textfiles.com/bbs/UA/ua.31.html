 1: llo everyone.
 2:
 3: Well after a while away from the hassles and troubles of the HP scene I
 4: now find myself amoungst the people who are making HP what it is today.
 5: After searching through the messages accumulated over the last year or
 6: so
 7: I would like to put forward some information which I believe currently
 8: does
 9: not exist on the BBS. Please bear in mind that not all of these numbers
10: will
11: work in your area, these presently work in the Glasgow area where I
12: consume
13: oxygen and carbon monoxcide ... and remember, dont phone its just 4
14: phun !
15:
16: TTFN
17:
18: Z-N0TE
19:
20: --------------[ Quad Digit Scan ]----[ August 1st 1995 ]--------------
21: ---------------------[ Scan Conducted By Z-N0TE ]---------------------
22:
23: Info ...
24: I have played around with a few of these number a little more than I am
25: letting on (whats the use in giving ALL the info away !) there are some
26: little gems just waiting to be found, amoungst them there are diverters
27: calling a certain exchange routes you to another city etc ... I've also
28: come across a variety of small service providers I didnt know operated
29: in the UK such as Energis, Telia, WorldCom etc. A few words of warning
30: when scanning your local exchange always remember to MISS OUT operator
31: calls such as 100, 112, 198, 999 and also the pay-thru-arse 192 etc...
32:
33: Notes...
34: When scanning always have a valid excuse or two at the ready, if you
35: come
36: across an operator or such like that has CLI then politely excuse
37: yourself
38: for dialing wrong and dont emm and umm them ... For example if you
39: manage
40: to route to an operator somewhere say, Sorry, I was trying to get
41: through
42: to the international operator, when they say why tell em you wanted to
43: check
44: the off-peak charges for calling South Africa etc etc ... Let it roll
45: off
46: your tounge ... Dont just hang up as this makes people suspicious,
47: especially
48: at 3:00am on a Sunday !
49:
50: Little Things of Interest...
51: 1747     - Calls back the last person to call you (saves 1471 then
52: dialing).
53:
54: 1470 XXX - This will call XXX with Caller Display enabled (if have a
55: permanant
56:            line block and are calling a service which require CID).
57:
58: 220-9    - This is interesting, and the first I've found. When called
59: it will
60:            just sit there doing nothing, enter another 3 digits and it
61: will
62:            put a call through (to 192,123,100 etc). Using ChargeAdvice
63: I have
64:            been told that the cost of the call is just 5p, standard
65: charge
66:            for a local call, this leads me to believe that calls placed
67: thru
68:            this number are ALL charged this way, so a call to 192 costs
69: 1/5
70:            of the price etc. When I puzzled an operator on this she
71: said the
72:            line spare on the exchange and took the last 3 digits and
73: routed
74:            them, like a diverter. This was also tested by calling 100
75: and 999
76:            and seeing if CLI/Line locking was avalible, it was not ...
77: I now
78:            think that there are a few possibilites with this and will
79: probe
80:            deeper to see what can be unearthed.

   We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could
be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us
criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after
knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
   You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
   Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of
judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
   My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive
me for.

             system of its kind in the U.K.

             We specialise in the discussion and distibution of technological
             research material on controversial computer underground subjects
             such as computer hacking, phone phreaking, cellular phreaking,
             computer viruses, satellite hacking, etc.

             Our file archives include 3,600+ files which have been
             collected from systems around the world. Many of these systems
             are no longer online and much of this material is not available
