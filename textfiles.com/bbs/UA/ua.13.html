Why not try a little gadget called THE VIDEO ENHANCER its a legal device
available in the UK which strips off the protection which is one
line{above the TV but is not usually copied when doing tape to tape but
neeeded for that tape film sync. It replaces it with a copied blue line
sync. Note you never actually see this blue line, Iam told its present
though. I think they retail for under a ton, I can get you all the info
you want on them if you like. what you got thats new, I got ROBO 3,
JURRASIC PARK, DRAGON, CITY HUNTER, what about you ???

You guys missed a really good laugh at the conference...
As for copy protection on videos, I think if you take the signal from VHS
out to Betamax in and Betamax out to VHS in and play the tape on VHS 1 and
the recording tape on VHS 2 it gets rid of the shit (something to do with
screen compression apparently...)
Can anyone set me up withg some good pirate videos, the ones you were
mentioning Cypher sounded cool, how can I get hold of them?
nb. Details on the video enhancer would be good :-)
I have never seen so many geeks in one place at that conference although
there were some cool people there loike Emmanuelle Goldstein, Ropp, The
Key, The Dude, live chat with Phiber Optic, Billsf (Weird Al :-) and other
assorted from CCC, 2600, Hacktic etc.
BTW...go to Amsterdam, it is the best place I have ever been in my life
and I intend to move there one day, fuck england...
Eric Bloodaxe was there (I think it was him) and he was such a geek
(confirmation from Paradigm, Phantasm, Boot plz...)
It was really cool...

The Grim Reaper, glad to hear you enjoyed the conference. I also found it
to be a most excellent trip. It was nice to talk with Emmanuel Goldstein
(26oo's editor) and Billsf (or Weird Al Yankovich).
 
Believe it or not, BOOT's parents didn't bother to pick him up after we
returned to Newark and he had to stay at the UABBS HQ.

I want to attach a network sniffer as the 'payload' of the virus and thus

any decent coder can handle a virus to pick up passwords and stuff liek
that which I think is a far better use of programming expertise than
writing some piece of childish shit to wipe the FAT or print a message or

The Virus Construction Set may be a starting point (though I`ve never seen

TRaP ZeR0, It was cool to actually meet you at the conference in Holland.
I got a note on the Hacktic notice board saying that 'The Raven' from New
York, USA was trying to find me. I also hear that Phrack's editor and Eric
Bloodaxe/Legion of Doom were at the conference along with the Wau Holland
from Chaos Computer Club. Did you meet any of these people? Would you
believe that we actually got through customs without any hassle?

M. P. Supplies
1 Old Mill Parade
Romford

They do lockpick sets, the lockaid gun, car entering equipment, tubular

Well if you have a 14.4k modem why not type in before you call
AT&N6 this should temporary lock your modem in at 9600 and this is much
better for connects.

Private Branch Exchanges are usually used by Compaines who wish for all
their employees calls to be logged, and thus finacial cost control on
expenditures can be more easily aduited. But thats there problem, a PBX
will allow you to call anywhere in the world for free and allow you to
start alliance teleconfs for free as well. When you call usually you
would have to insert a pin digit pass code. To be allowed to dial out.
This can range from 4-6 digits although I did come across one that was a
10 digit one and that was the phone number of the business but that was a
total one off.

Subject: Legion of Doom T-shirts

"LEGION OF DOOM--INTERNET WORLD TOUR" T-SHIRTS!

Now you too can own an official Legion of Doom T-shirt.  This
is the same shirt that sold-out rapidly at the "Cyberview
hackers conference in St. Louis.  Join the other proud owners
such as Lotus founder Mitch Kapor and award-winning author Bruce
Sterling by adding this collector's item to your wardrobe.  This
professionally made, 100 percent cotton shirt is printed on both
front and back.  The front displays "Legion of Doom Internet World
Tour" as well as a sword and telephone intersecting the planet
earth, skull-and-crossbones style.  The back displays the
words "Hacking for Jesus" as well as a substantial list of "tour-stops"
(internet sites) and a quote from Aleister Crowley.  This T-shirt is sold
only as a novelty item, and is in no way attempting to glorify computer
crime.
Shirts are only $15.00, postage included!  Overseas add an
additional $5.00.  Send check or money-order (No CODs, cash or
credit cards--even if it's really your card) made payable to

			    THE HISTORY OF PHREAKING
			    ------------------------

  DID YOU KNOW THAT PHREAKING STARTED FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY SOURCE......
  CAP'N CRUNCH CEREAL!

  YES, IN THE 1960'S A TOY WHISTLE WAS PLACED IN THE FAMOUS CEREAL.
UNFORTUNATELY (NOT FOR US), THE WHISTLE GENERATED 2,600 CYCLE-TONE, DUDE!  A
YOUNG MAN WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE USAF AS A RADIO TECH., WAS FASCINATED WHEN
HE DISCOVERED THAT BY BLOWING THE WHISTLE INTO THE FONE AFTER DIALING ANY
LONG-DISTANCE # AND HEAING THE DIS- CONNECT SIGNAL, THE TRUNK WOULD REMAIN OPEN
WITHOUT TOLL CHARGES ACCOUNTING, AND FROM THEN ON, ANY NUMBER COULD BE DIALED
REPEATEDLY.  800 #'S (INWATS) , WERE LATER USED AS THE STARTER CALL TO AVOID
ANY CHARGES.  HE USED THIS TO CALL HOME WHILE STATIONED IN ENGLAND.

VWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWZYZABCDEFGH
 
  Most people when they make their 1st
attempt at choosing an alias to mark
their computing "career" tend to reach
for the obvious, lets take a look...
 
MASTER
======
 
  Never include the word "Master" any-
where in your alias because most likely
you are not.  Master connotates some-
thing that you have total control over
which, of course, most of the dweebs
that are modeming nowadays dont.  Of
course there will be exceptions and 
some of us will tend to be "masters"
but the word "master" is so overused
that its not feasible anymore so keep
away from that.  If, however, you wish
to include the prefix "Mastur" some-
where in your soon-to-be-famous alias,
then that is solely up to you.
 
DATA
====
 
  Data...now that leaves a lot of doors
open.  It would seem that a lot of 
people would have chosen that by now,
but apparently not.  I guess it is
because you can only make several alias
out of that:  Data D00d, Data Leech,
	      Data Man, or Data Dweeb.
Now, you tell me why you shouldnt use
the word "Data" if you can help it.
Even if you could think of a decent 
alias using the word "data", why would
you want to be known as a chunk of 
info?  Be my guest, use it, Im not your
dad.
 
DUDE, D00D
====  ====
 
  I think its quite obvious why you 
should not use any of these in your
new nickname.  As Ive said before,
most of you skinny wimps are NOT dudes
nor do you resemble 1 in the slightest
way.  Im sure that a number of you more
elite users are completely inherent of
the "Dude" aspect but that would just
cause people to question you, wondering
whether or not youre a rodent.  If you 
want to use "Dude" then I suggest you
prove it rather quickly.
  "D00d", on the other hand, is quite
self-explanatory.  Let the rodents of
the world use "D00D".  That way we can
identify them more easily and kick them
off all of the Boards.  A rodent is a
rodent is a rodent and will always be
one.  Never let one trick you into be-
lieving he's changed, especially if he
used "D00D" in a previous name.
 
DIGITAL
=======
 
  Well, I just consulted Websters Un-
abridged Dictionary and their defini-
tion of "Digital" is as follows:
     1. Of, pertaining to, or resem-
	bling a digit, or digits.
     2. Digitate.
     3. Performed with the finger.
     4. Using numbers that are digits 
	to represent all the variables
	involved in calculation.
     5. Showing the time, temp, etc. by
	a row of digits rather than by
	numbers on a dial <eg. a watch>
Well, as far as #1 goes, I dont think
that any of you would resemble a digit
except the number one if you are skinny
enough or the number eight if you are
fat enough.  If you resemble any other
number then youd better get to the 
doctors fast.  Now, number 2, ok, if 
you can visualize yourself "digitating"
then have fun, be a fool.  Number 3
kind of makes me want to laugh, and 
very hard at that.  Well, if you pick
"digital" for this purpose, then I
suggest you be careful with the other
half of your name.  People may wonder
just what it is you are actually
"fingering".  Then there's the 4th def-
intion which is fairly feasible, seeing
as computers and variables form a
comprehensible interaction.  As for
#5, unless you plan to be a meteorolo-
gist then youd better skip it.
  Dont knock it though, Ive seen some
decent names with "digital" in them,
Digital Madness being one of them.  If
you are so daring as to use it as a 
noun then you would be telling every-
one that you wish to be thought of as:
    a finger, a key on an instrument,
    or the last joint in a spiders leg.
Ive spent enough time on this one, so
on we go.
 
DISK
====
 
  Everybody and his brother thinks of
using the word "disk" somewhere in 
their alias, but thats so unoriginal.
I mean, shit, thats the first thing you
touch when you decide you want to use
your computer.  Well, some of you wierd
people might touch something else, but
Im speaking for the majority of us.
If you didnt have a disk then your
computer would be worthless as far as
enjoyment would go, unless youll enjoy
the money you get from selling it. Im
sure therell be some "Masters" that
disagree with that, but lets see how
much fun you can have without disks.
You get my point.
  Creativity stands a chance here.  
This is one of the few words though, 
that when utilized in an alias that is
out of context, can still sound fine.
For Example, "Slipped Disk" or "Disko
Dude" <see "Dude"> are acceptable.
 
BANDIT
======
 
  One of the less imaginitive words to
use.  I fell under this category at one
point.  Coming from UMass (University
of Massachusetts) I merely added the
word "Bandit" on the end of my schools
name, how ingenius.  I did that mainly
because I wanted to represent my school
somehow and that would be the only way
to use UMass without sounding too queer
or ornate.  Im not so sure how my newer
alias is, but its not an ordinary every
day word.
  As I was pointing out, "Bandit" is a
word that people use to make you think
that they are some mysterious pilferer,
whether it concerns Pirating, Hacking,
Phreaking, or anything connected with
the greyer areas concerning legality.
It seems, in my opinion, to be too easy
to merely tack on "Bandit" at the end
of your name.  One name that has become
somewhat noteable is "Apple Bandit". 
That mustve taken a lot of hard thought
time and effort to create that alias.
Think about what Ive just said if you
were deciding whether or not to be a
so-called "Bandit".
 
CRASHER
=======
 
  Unfortunately, this touches upon the
"Master" concept.  If you cant crash
much more than say, a D-dial, then it
stands to reason that using any form of
this word in your name would cause you
to be frowned upon as some derivative 
of the word "geek".  If all you can 
crash is A-Net then you should go back
and consider the word "Bandit" because
even a user in diapers knows how to do
that and youd merely be "Bandit"ing
someone elses techniques.  If you have
the know-how to crash many types of
systems then youre still at a loss be-
cause anyone that "Crashes" a friendly
system is a true asshole in every 
respect of the word.  Its ok, though, 
if the SysOp is a dickshit, then you
can relax.  If you plan on using this
then you should be more specific so 
others will know just what type of 
things you crash (Disks, Autos, Windows
etc).
 
HACKER
======
 
  Now, this is a great word to use in
your name, if you hack that is. Hacking
is considered by many of the ignorant
people of this blasphemed world to be
a threat to society.  Granted we have
some assholes out there who try to be
Mr Wargames himself, but there are many
"hackers" that do not fit that crude
description. Many "Hackers" are only
out to satisfy their curiosity and a 
lot of places could benefit from 
hackers if they (the places) would just
quit being such paranoid assholes. In
other words, "Hacker" (if you are) is
quite a noble word to help enhance your
alias.  Just put some thought into it.
One good example Ive seen is "The 
Ubiquitous Hacker" (famed Mender of 
Catfur 2.2, remember?) or the "Unknown
Hacker".
 
PHREAK, PHREEK
======  ======
 
  I myself dont approve of these being
used in part of a nickname, however,
you may disagree.  I never said you had
to agree with anything in here.  A good
phreak is noticed by his actions, his
manners, and his information.  Putting
the word "Phreak" or "Phreek" (which is
a stupid spelling for a derivative) in
your name makes it look like you are
trying to call too much attention to 
it.  If you wish to have a name that is
relevant to phreaking then take some
of your jargon and work with that, you
know, something dealing with PBXs or
WATS extenders, or some bogus company
that you guys rip off day in and day
out such as MCI, SPRINT or AT&T.  If
youre still at a loss then you should
pick up your phone (if youve passed 
that stage), dial 0, and ask the nice
lady on the other end what her name is
and try that.
 
RAD
===
 
  The word "Rad" or any form of it in
your name would tend to have people
believe that you are some type of mad
partying, incredibly popular person.
Well, 90% of modemers know that 90% of
modemers are probably scrawny little 
losers (if youre offended then eat
some protein or twinkies, geek), 9.5%
know that 9.5% are pretty damn cool
people who have plenty of other things
to do, but get a kick, and at times a
challenge out of some of the things
associated with modeming (theft, drugs,
etc). The other .5% either just got 
their new Micromodem ][e for Christmas
or are somewhere way out in left field
picking their nose, so unless you are
truly "Rad" then you might want to 
shop elsewhere.

			 SO YOU WANT TO BE A SYSOP?
			       by Wally Byczek                          
			     WallyWorld BBS 1989                        
    
 To start a BBS, you first need a computer. No matter what computer you      
currently have, it won't be large enough or powerful enough for what you     
intend to do. And since you can't take the board down (unless you run a      
kiddy board that bounces up and down or runs only between the time           
school lets out and Daddy comes home) to do your own work, you will need     
another computer that you can ill afford. Next you have to find a BBS        
software package. This can take months, or you can write your own if you     
are so inclined. This can take years. Next, unless you are starting a        
kiddy board, you will need a phone line other than the one that you          
normally converse on. Depending on the Telco's mood, personnel, and the      
imminence of a strike, this could be done in as little as 2 weeks or it      
may never happen. Next, if you plan to run doors on your board, you must     
now spend long distance dollars in scouring other boards for evaluation and  
aquisition of these games. Naturally, your external file protocols don't     
come with your BBS software, so you have to again scour the countryside to   
find them. Utilities for your BBS are also an after thought and have to      
be obtained in a similar fashion. All of these external programs have to     
be registered after a while, since most stop working after a while or have   
an annoying feature about them until they are registered. All of the above   
items take money! and plenty of it!                                          
								       
While we are on the subject of money, you must obtain a modem. Whatever      
modem you currently have will not be supported by the BBS software. This     
is some sort of unwritten law pertaining to writing communication software.  
Be prepared to open your wallet wide. No, your old Hayes 300 won't be good   
enough. People even hate 1200 baud these days, and the teenagers seem to     
have USR HST's these days and will complain vociferously if they can't       
access you at 14.4.                                                          
									     
Now you pick a name for your BBS. Whatever you choose will be                
ridiculed by 20% of those who see it. Another 50% will offer suggestions     
that are worse than the one you chose. The remaining 30% won't care.         
									     
Next comes the wonderful task of installing your board. You have your        
machine. If you just bought it, that means formatting your hard disk,        
installing DOS, and ASNI drivers and Lord knows what else that you need      
for your board. If you already have the machine, you may as well go ahead    
and reformat it anyway. Something will guarantee that you will have to       
do this before you are done.                                                 
The manual for the BBS software was most likely written                      
by the author's 10 year old and was mimeographed. It got wet in the mail     
and smeared as well, so at least 30% of the manual will be physically        
useless. The rest is just procedurally useless.                              
									     
Next comes the fun task of deciding on your board structure. Who can do      
what and when can they do it. You must design your menus and opening screens.
You have to get a pretty good stock of files, because no one will upload to  
you unless you have something there for them to take first. (not that it     
matters, I suppose, since even if you DO have files, they won't upload       
much anyway.)                                                                
									     
Next comes the security aspect. You can leave your board wide open so that   
users with the name of Benny Beanfart, Dr. Rape, Crack, Hack, File Attack,   
DR DEATH, etc can come in and do anything they like. Or, you can lock it     
up so tight that no one will call. There is no compromise on this.           
									     
Next you must build events or prepare to live at your keyboard. A BBS HAS    
to be backed up. If you can't afford a high density backup medium such as    
tape or cartridge, you will spend many many hours per week flipping          
floppies. Events are designed to allow the sysop the luxury of having the    
board do routine tasks at odd hours by itself- Backups, purges and so on.    
These never work as they come and will have to be extensively modified by    
you. And since they generally only run at 3 AM, you will have to be awake    
to see just how they die and then try to fix it.                             
									     
Alright... the big day is here. Your board is ready, your modem is ready,    
Telco finally hooked you up, and then you start up. This is when after 2     
days of no one calling, despite your ad in computer shopper and having       
placed your number on every other BBS in existance, you discover that the    
init strings for the modem are wrong. You discover this by calling yourself  
from a friends' home. This takes calls to the author of the software, the    
manufacturer of the modem and finally gets resolved by asking another sysop  
how to do it.                                                                
									     
Oh Boy! Now we're in business! During your first caller's visit, someone     
will hit a telephone pole and you will lose power. Naturally, since the      
board is new, you didn't back it up. The power surge when the electricity    
was restored roached your hard disk. Go back to low level formating...       
									     
Finally, you're up and working. After about a week of gleefully seeing       
someone call, you will encounter Benny Beanfart or his ilk. He will leave    
public posts (always in caps and terribly mis-spelled) about what a really   
lousey board this is and that the sysop is a three eyed twit. You            
automaticly kill his account. But do you leave the message for the world     
to see? hmmm... dilemma number 1. Killing Benny does no good because he      
will be back with another account such as SYSOP SUX or some such thing.      
Eventually he will tire of the game and go away, but he has given ideas to   
30 of his friends who will also visit you sometime in the next week.         
									     
Then you will be visited by the "smart kid" who can tell you everything      
that's wrong with your machine, your software, etc. It doesn't matter that   
he's calling you on a Timex Sinclair. He knows more about your 386 than      
Intel.                                                                       
									     
By now, your name has spread around. Probably, if you are in Worcester,      
the college kids have your name and number. If it is Spetember or January    
you are in trouble. You will probably be bombarded with file requests for    
commercial software. Some will assist you by uploading Lotus 123 ver 3 that  
has the copy-proofing removed. Whoever uploads this to you will then call    
Lotus Development Corp and tell them that you have a pirated version on your 
board (anonymously of course)                                                
									     
If you imposed an upload/download ratio such that users must upload one file 
to get x numbers of files in return, then you will recieve 2K text files from
them. They will download 2Mb of Gif files in return.                         
									     
By now, you are disappointed with your message bases. You perhaps have (if you
are fortunate) two or three users who post messages outside of private mail. 
These three users are symbionts who, if one of their number does not call    
for 2 weeks, will not post because they miss their friend. Your message      
bases will starve. You set up many areas for messages, all carefully listed  
by topic. No public post will ever go into the area that it should be in.    
You will find a raunchy joke posted in the Bible topics area, technical      
questions asked in the political opinion area, and a message from one of     
Benny Beanfart's croney's in the technical section.                          
									     
								    
You will next encounter the user who can't do anything right. He will make   
you feel terribly guilty that you are running this system that seems to      
rudely exclude him from enjoying it, because he cannot master the concept    
that M means Message, F means Files, D means download etc. He DOES however   
know how to leave comments to the sysop.                                     
									     
									     
At first you will be responsive to all the user complaints and will make     
a valiant effort to obtain the special game that was requested as a door.    
You discover it on a board in the Fiji Islands and the off peak call cost    
you 32 dollars to download it. You find then that the game was written for   
a board other than the BBS that you run. You search the countryside for a    
conversion interface. You find one in Omaha. add another 40 dollars in       
phone bills from the search.You discover now that the game must be registered
with the author. This is another 69 dollars. You discovered this because     
after the game was installed, you called from a friend's house to test it.   
You find out that while the console looks wonderful while it is being run,   
the user sees a screen that informs him that the sysop is a cheap bum who    
didn't even bother to register this wonderful piece of software. Since the   
sysop is such a creep, why do you call there? Naturally, you register it so  
the annoyance screen goes away. After it has been on the board for 2 months  
you discover that only 1 person ever used it and he only went in there once, 
dropped carrier and hung up the board because you later discovered that this 
"wonderful" piece of software doesn't monitor carrier. Do you now register   
Watchdog so this won't happen again or do you just scrap the game?           
									     
The work load is getting heavy on the board. Wow! It takes at least 2 hours  
per day to stay up with things. Answering mail, hunting down Benny Beanfart's
latest account, changing screens, moving messages back to the areas that     
they truely belong in, adding new things, paying Telco, arguing with your    
spouse, etc. You decide that perhaps it's time to enlist some help in the    
form of an assistant sysop. This is a mistake. The assistant will pay little 
attention to the needs of the board, but WILL experiment with things like    
remote drop to dos. hehehehe! I think this needs little elaboration.         
									     
By now, you are conversant with the many user complaints. WHY aren't you     
around to answer the sysop page at 2:45 AM? Why does your message editor     
use A for abort instead of Q for quit? How come there aren't any nice ANSI   
screens? How come these crummy ANSI screens slow down the board? Why can't   
I stay online for 3 hours at a time? Why can't my C64 see your graphics.. It 
must be your crummy board! I never post messages because no one else ever    
does! What do you mean you killed my upload of Dbase IV? I did upload        
something a year ago.. so how come I can't download more than 100 files now? 
How come my friend has access level 50 and I only have level 40? Boy.. do you
have a bad attitude! I think the Silicon Sarcophagus is 100 times better than
this board! This is a free country.. I can say ANYTHING I want in public     
messages. What are you.. Hitler or something? How come nobody ever send me   
mail? I used a bit editor on Procomm and now it won't work.. tell me how to  
fix it. That GIF file I downloaded didn't run... this stinks... you really   
must be a lousey sysop if you don't check to see that it would work for me.  
									     
Then you will discover the wonders of sysop to user interactive chat. You    
will find this to be a most opportune time to get things done. Since the     
majority of users who will page you into chat type at about .000001 baud,    
you can have a conversation with the user and get things done like mowing    
the lawn, making a three course meal, and cleaning out the garage before     
the user has stated his request. Generally, the chat request was for         
something such as How do I get out of a file listing or something similar    
that is well covered in the user manual that you have both as a file for     
downloading and as a bulletin for online reading.                            
									     
One admonition is to not get angry about carrier drop by the user. Remember  
that the user is calling you through the telco. Chances are that no matter   
how malicious or inept the user may be, the telco probably did it anyway.    
									     
Next comes BBS software upgrade time! Such fun! You will find that the       
author no longer supports your version. You have to upgrade. This means      
once again opening your wallet. The new version will not have the same       
reserved file names, nor will the file structures be the same. The author    
generously supplies you with a conversion program. This program is designed  
to assist you in making all the little changes needed to perform the upgrade.
It will automatically convert your file names and structures. There are two  
type of these programs. One that requires that you have 5Mb more free space  
than you do, and the other that will abort half way through the conversion   
because of a bad disk sector read and didn't have a corresponding error      
trap. Of the two, the latter is the more catastrophic, because now your data 
can't be read by either version of the software.                             
									     
Since you successfully upgraded your software, you now discover what the     
word Beta Site really means..                                                
									     
Now since you've done so well to this point, it's time for the hardware to   
find something to compensate for all this good effort. Generally, the        
hard drive controller is the most likely device to make this decision to     
fail. It will not however abruptly die. It will instead, gradually mis-write 
to disk over a period of several days before deciding not to work at all     
anymore. This has the advantage that your last backups will be no good at    
all once you replace the controller and reformat the drive.                  
									     
hehehe! Still want to be a sysop?

I have been waiting a long time for this.. Sitting in front of my computer..
reading those crappy messages being circulating, with all too many of them
hitting home hard.  And I thought, for I know what its like to be on the top,
and on the bottom.  Everyone who makes it to the top goes through the period
of learning.  I decided, it was time.  Time to unmask the glory and mystery
of the secret boards, the elite sections, and the secret societies.  To give
the normal modeming crowd a look at the top, a look at the society known to
all but themselves as...   The AE Studs...




First of all, Studs feel that if you aren't a part of their group, that you
don't have 80 cols.  They feel it's necessary to format it for those poor
buggers still using 40 cols.  When it's usually them!  The studs who first got
he //+ and never bothered to update it.  The new society bothers them.  The
nw group with sleek Promethius Modems.  'If it can fit into a slot in your
computer, its a geek machine.'  They say trying to comfort themselves as they
o out and buy the expensive, glittering Hayes modems.  Look at how nice this
modem works, how can anyone settle for less?  They feel so insecure about
their position in the modem society that they booze it up, trying to show that
modeming isn't th only thing in their lives.  How they got up there without
putting modeming first, is beyond me.  They call the secret society boards,
and with secret passwords, they log in.  To what?  They don't tell.  But if 
you venture there, you find a great deal of deadbeats.  All enslaved to
crackin programs and solving adventures.  A great many of them DO stay up
Saturday nights, but not to booze it up... To slve that one last mystery, 
to overcome hat password, to get past that security.  That is the kind that
lives beyond the silver pirate flags  Of course, not all are that way. In
deed, there are the ones that don't belong there.  But happened to know a
real hacker and got in through him.  Now what?  They learn from the best..
they get a copy of COPY II PLUS and NOW they can disk edit!  They gt the
newest games, the latest cheats.  But they don't contriute!  They sally forth
with this knowledge and taunt those they think below them, those who can't
get into the boards.  It hasn't evencrossed their inferior minds that people
might NOT WANT TO GET THERE.  So they pass around the programs, sometimes
even daring to put their name on it.  And replace the faithful pirate that
brings it home for all of us.  And then they boast and strut, but feel afraid.
Tey feel afraid that someone will penetrate their society and see what is
there.  Smeone that might tell everyone what really goes on at the top.
It's the SAME thing.  Yes, they use GBBS, yes, they still scream and rag on
each other.  Worse than a new user ever would.  They see that, and it 
threatens them.. So they begin the long, grueling process of writing a text
file, and putting together steriotypes.  And mashing all the things that
an unexperianced user does.  It intimidates the crap out of them right?  You
fear needlessly.  For where do they get most of the ideas?  Correct, from
their own experiance.  They remember when they first got a modem, when 
Krakowitz DID exist, and he laughed at them.  They posted the messages hardly
knowing how, saying 'Talk to me' and got hate mail, and got crank calls made
to their place, but now they're there.  And they want their revenge.  So they
take it out on those who can't defend themselves.  The unexperianced,the
new in the area.  Those cowards.. Building themselves up with false pride,
protecting their egos with lies.  When all it wouldtake to collapse it is
a single new user coming in, and posting a painful memory awakining,


'Hey everyone, I'm kinda new around here...' message.


			How sad.

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one. 

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
