 Title: Facism
  From: The Grim Reaper [6]
  Time: Fri May 28 23:52:10 1993

When I think of a police officer trying to say a plant that is several
times older than man is illegal I nearly piss myself with after.
Getting philosophical for a moment, I can and will do anything I want to
do anytime I want. There is no such thing as natural law. All things are
the same. Its ridiuclous that smack addicts have to go around stealing and
costing police time and money to get a fix of impure expensive shite, when
they could be giving the same by the government for a couple of pence and
do community service to pay for it. Save stealing. Save impurity and
dangeroud cuts. Give junkies something to do and let them get on with it.
As you say, your business is none of mine or anyone elses...
FUck em...

8:-)  I dont know if Networks 93 will be held with the Which show this
year.  Networks 93 schedule goes like this:  Tuesday 29 June,  Wednesday
30 June both at 10am - 5:40pm and Thursday 1 July at 10am - 4:30am.  Do
you think that you will be able to get that valuable ref # this year.  I
cannot seem to find anyone who knows about the Which show.
