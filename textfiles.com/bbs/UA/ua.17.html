Black Widow, I am replying to your msg regarding Alex Coe. Since you
posted this I have reset the Boards/SIGs and reconfigured the whole
message base, therefore removing all messages regarding Alex Coe.

I suggest you post a message regarding the bust and get things started
again. It shouldnt take long as most users of this system know what type
of a person (shit) he actually was.

 Title: Cell phreaking
  From: Cookie Monster [69]
  Time: Wed Aug 25 00:05:39 1993
Well the easiest way is by cloning the phones. Change the EEPROM that
contains the details of the serial number etc of the phone and
cellnet/vodaphone thinks it's a different phone. You can then use someone
elses phone until he switches his on or notices the trouble. More info can
be gained from me if you want, and the reprogram is completely
untrackable...
