I have program that says it converts newer USR 14.4 modems to 16.8 it has
some roughly eritten docs with it. I have no luck with it , it just
freezes or says "Divide by zero" or something.
I have come to the conlclusion its a fake, didn't take too long.
I'll U/L maybe it works for some USR's.

Here in Belgium you can reach some weird operators with Silverbox tones
but only on old exchanges. In Germany, you were able to tap phonelines
with them. Play silverbox tones to an ASPEN VMB and it'll go berserk, etc.

Im more or less clear on the use of a PBX but do I have to use a DTMF fone
to enter the code(or any DTMF touch tone oad of course) to use it or will
ordinary pulse dial do
?I ask this as Id prefer to use them from a payfone..

Yeah, I was starting to believe it's crap too but I've just been validated
on a board and they have a conf about ATMs. There was a message in there
which  stated the same thing. So something must be true about it. I'll try
to get more info's.

Hey,  if you want a good way of fooling British Rail then what you do is
this : Buy a ticket for the nearest station, then jump on the train to
Nottingham and make a big fuss when the ticket man comes ie. swear a lot
etc. about how you got on the wrong train. They will put you off at the
next station and prolly pay the fare back up! This has worked as a friend
of mine did this by mistake and jumped on the London express from
Edinburgh - the next station was Carlisle!

'Hacking at the End of the Universe (HEU)' August 4th, 5th & 6th 1993.

Hack-Tic have organised a three-day conference for computer hackers, phone
phreaks and techno-anarchists for only 100 dutch guilders (about 35.00 pounds

The event will be held at the Larserbos Campground, which is about 3 mile
southeast of Lelystad, or a 34 minute train ride from Amsterdam.
 
The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops on
hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual reality,
semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking, virusses, paranoia,
legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and elsewhere and much, much more.

How about uploading a few decent underground board adverts from the USA?
Select <P>ost a message and ASCII upload your text without line feeds.
I would do this myself but the system only accepts remote ASCII uploads.
Please cut adverts and post individually in this SIG.

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one. 

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
