The previous one (in 1989) was for free and there was also Internet
access. Well, it doesn't have to be for free but 100 guilders is a lot of
money since you have to consider that most hackers/phreakers are students.

i think that hacktic lost a lot of money last time.., i think the price
almost justifys its self...the hire of the site must cost a bomb..
also if ya was going to see a band say something class like 'slayer' 
thatll prob set ya back about 15 squid for 5 hours!!!!! 
anyway i think it is a bit to steep but for 4 1/2 days it isnt that bad..

well,i think 100 is far to much...
 
if you have a look at other computer parties,you will see they don't cost 
half as much as this one...
 
i have been in aars last christmas
and the enterance fee was 30 dm
that was pretty much i think...

Vaxcine, you could always try a little social engineering or scan for a BT
Inward operator. I remember back in 1991 when I got the ex-directory
number of Darren Ingram (ex-sysop of the famous Corrupt Computing BBS)
after seeing his street name and location in a newspaper article.

 Title: Vodafone GSM
  From: Cryptic [8]
  Time: Wed Jul 21 01:25:10 1993

Has Anyone Read The Specs. On the new vodafone MCN which they hope to
install later this year.  They will be using the GSM and using digital
phones each subscriber will have their own SIMCARD(Subscriber Identity
Module) either as a credit card or miniature plug-in thing.  This chip
allows the Subscriber to go anywhere in the world with their phone or
anybdy elses phone just by using their SIMCARD in the phone ... It allows
you to receive and make calls on any phone..anywhere .!! 
  The technology/extras the card brings also are an authentication
alogarithym(to make sure the chip is an original) an encryption algorithm
which determines the speech cipher code two security codes to protect
against unauthorised use. and 5 short memory stores(can`t understand
these) allowing the useer to store a message of up to 160 characters each.
 
 Other extras in the new network will be Call forwarding, call barring,
Short Message Service(Still Can`t work this one out), Cell broadcast, data
trasmission, call waiting, hyold for enquiry, upto 6 way conferencing,
caller ID facility and call transfer .. these will be phased in over 2
More..(Yes/No/Scroll)                     years.
 
The best thing I think of this is the fact that later versions of these
GSM phones will be able to interface will all portable PCs/COmputers/Handhe
lds etc allowing data trans. upto 9600 bps.
  Apparently Vodaphone have installed most of the GSM network (90%) so its
just a matter of public availabilty of the phones etc .. or am I being
stupid and has everybody known about this for ages ... anyway I`ll
transribe a copy of the bulletin I`ve got and u/load it sometime ... later

AIX doesn't come with defaults (unpassworded or not) installed. But I've
seen many where 'test' or 'demo' worked. Also, if they are on Internet you
can tftp the passwd file. It's shadowed but there could be some homey
account around or some expired ones. Like the expired account I once
found.. didn't even asked for the old password.

Someone has just brought out an album called "Scanners", the whole album
consists of sections of conversations they have scanned from mobiles and
sampled, overlayed etc. They interviewed the guy responsible for it and

Did any of ya see the MTV news today ???
 
Someone has just brought out an album called "Scanners", the whole album
consists of sections of conversations they have scanned from mobiles and
sampled, overlayed etc. They interviewed the guy responsible for it and
he was demonstrating his scanner and played some of the messages back of
drug dealings and shit like that. Bound to hear it on the Chart Show!

As far as I know, the tent I`m taking for us to sleep in is a 5 man tent,
so there should be plenty of room for one extra, maybe for two if someone
else needs somewhere to kip...
The plan is this...when the lectures etc. are finished for the night and
there is nothing else to do, the tent will be sealed as airtight as
possible and much hash/weed smoked.
If you don1t mind this, you`re welcome to sleep there...

Another Kettle of Fish BBS
 
I am trying to set up an anarchist BBS based in manchester.  AKOF was
first
started this year as part of the manchester anti copyright convention, and
has since become a permanent fixture.
 
I intend to 'grow' AKOF into a BBS where people can access all sorts of 
information, concerning all sorts of 'subversive' subjects including
hacking and phreaking and also things such as squatting and free festival
information.
 
The main problem with AKOF has been the lack of users, and in particular, 
the lack of users interested in more than downloading video games.  So I
am attempting to make contact with other people interested in this sort
of BBS.

I've just talked to someone from the swedish hackers association (aka
UxU), they're sending a delegation too. They'll be wearing T-shirts with
'UxU' handwritten on it. As for the Belgians (only two so far), we'll be
wearing a red hat with 'BELGA' written on one side and 'LIVE' on the other
side. It's one of these hats we get for free on every concert in Belgium.
Now, I suggest that you guys (the British) hang a big sign above the
entrance of your tent saying 'UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS' or something. Will
probably attract the feds as a pile of shit does with flies, but at least
i'll be able to identify you.
 
See you all in Holland, T0
 
BTW, it's amazing to see how many British companies have most of their
Unix users use the system without a password. Also, mucho ALTOS' and NCR
systems around in the UK, and both come with quite some defaults which
nearly always work. But we'll disuss that in Holland.

As I already told Phantasm, I'll just follow the scent of fresh weed..
Shit, I just hope the weather will get somewhat better so it won't rain
for the full 5 days. Of course, we could always break into an empty house

If anyone would like a photocopy of the 1972 article 'world telephone
systems at your fingertips' which was published in the Daily Telegraph
Magazine, send a <M>ail reply or Internet mail 'uabbs@works.uucp'.
 
The original article 'secrets of the little blue box' was published in
Esquire magazine in the USA. The 8 page A4 copy cost me 11.75 direct from
the Newspaper Library in London but I will send anyone interested a copy
for 2.50. I think this is a very fair price when you look at my expense.
 
The article covers everything from Al Gilbertson 'the creator of the blue
box' to Captain Crunch and his 'volkswagen van with an entire switchboard
and computerized super-sophisticated M-F-er in the back'. Inc. several
interesting blue box photo's for those studying 'portable blue box
design'. I am sure the following extract will make a few people smile...
 
COULD PHONE PHREAKS PHREAK THE GPO? (British Telecom was called Government
Post Office back in 1972... ask your parents for a history lesson).

penalties of a one hundred pound fine or three months in Jail."

How about uploading a few decent underground board adverts from the USA?
Select <P>ost a message and ASCII upload your text without line feeds.
I would do this myself but the system only accepts remote ASCII uploads.
Please cut adverts and post individually in this SIG.

Do you know if you can kermit (or FTP) off the /etc/passwd file from this
system? If so then I have a very good unix password cracker and access
to some 'safe' decstation5000's to run it on.
If FTP is no good, then try TFTP (trivial FTP) since this has less
security and more bugs (and hence is often removed after the UNIX is
installed)

I ran into an RSX-11M system. Well, first I didn't know what it was but I
got in with the system manager's account. However, there is one problem.
When I log in it first displays a banner (LOGIN.TXT I think), then it 
displays yet another screen where it asks to enter some kind of ID code.
I think you can compare it to an autoexec.bat thingie that is booted.
Anyway, I don't knwo the ID code so my question is, can I somehow break
out of the first text that gets displayed or the login program that is
started after that? 
 
This is very important to me since the system belongs to the Belgian
Telco. I'm also interested in any text files you know about RSX-11 or
RSTS/E (which is very similar).

There are many default Unix accounts, depends on software and software

SYNC, SYNC often gives you a blurb message with helpful details, where the
computer is etc.
WHO sometimes ( a la Norwich Union) gives you a list of users logged on,
which can be helpful for obvious reasons. Any good Unix guide should have
details of the accounts, also Phrack/Phun etc. have decent articles on

the only way so far i have been able to seize mercury so far is through
dial services after they place a call nack to the uk .. as someone
mentioned here already it seems onyl to accept kp1 and the fact you have
to have a working AT&T to get put through makes it a bit pointless..
interestingly though i placed a call to germany on it and found i was also
able to seize and dial off the line there as well .. although not for
holland.. i did try calling the mercury international 0500800800 i think
but you cant seize that (although i dont knwo if i would want to its just
a BIT too close to home heh)

on the subject of bxoing has anyone been playing with trindiad since it
went down  last yearive had great fun finding the routing codes for all
the diferent islands .. ie kp1-0088... for grenada and also found the only
combination you are allwed to dial with kp2 is kp2-592... cant get
snywhere with it though though i have manged to find a few numbers that
come up with a recording 'interbnationla access to this line is
prohibited'

Anyone wishing to use these services will require a loop in the USA.
Just tell the operator you would like to start a conference and give her
one side of the loop when she asks for your telephone number.
Dial the other side of the loop as soon as you disconnect and wait for
the operator to connect your conference nodes.
If anyone has any working non-filtered loops in the USA or Canada, send a

everyone i called blacklisted after 4-5 conf's i used to run em off a 206
loop .. still aorund and theyll still billto it i beleive 206-699-0018/19
 
actaul if you are internationl agetttong blacklisted is no problem.. as 
AT&T dont knwo how many digits international numbers are so if you are
blacklisted just get whoevers running it to dial your number with and
extra digit on the end and it works fine heh

 Title: green boxes!
  From: Datastream Cowboy [94]
  Time: Tue Jul 20 23:32:23 1993

Has anyone fucked about with one of those nice looking green boxes, one
can see up any old high-street? I'm thinking of nicking some BT type
overalls + toolkit, and having a good look. I think it is possible to
'beige box' by fiddling about with the shit inside. Let me know if anyone
has done this.. and had any luck!
l8r.

Oh all right! ;-) Well, using thLEO{e dial service (894487) it was
possible to enter your AT&T card, then by dialling any number in the uk
(or spain.france etc.) and w8ing for the 'kerchunk!' you could then break
using the mci satellite settings, and proceed to dial using A0636etc.C|s>2;
.kLmmQREy'>UR-L ... you could also aggravate Mercury inward by using A2DC,
ie: KP1+2+CODE11+ST...they (ALL of them) are rather dim so it's most
amusing! other than that...pointless really as you have to waste a calling
card to do it! haha}1UF_}ha But I spose it's more fun!

Another good way to get round the blacklisting on confs is to phone them
up and say that you have just got this phone number and you need to keep
in touch with your offices in US as you are a freel9vc^I\vance programmer
and they are unable to reach you the conf crashes blalbalbalba etc...

Dialling an extra digit to get a blaclisted number in your conf doesn't
always work. I know coz both my lines are blacklisted and the trick with
the extra digit doesn't work.

On the blue boxing program I use it doesn't allow you to type in 2600 or
2400 fro the seize line tones..instead it changes them to 2604 and 2403
respectivley..is this to avoid any chances of being traced by one of the
2600 Hz detectors..or dont they even exist in the UK?

the chances of getting caught carding ,in my experience, are very low. the
first thing that seems to happen if things go wrong is the shop keeper
blabs his mouth to you, telling you all. If things go kewl overt the phone
then whats to distiguish you from a valid customer? Nothing! (much)
Addresses that have been know to recieve carded goods may be visited by
the C.I.D but as long as no goods are found there nothing else tends to
happen. Don't card Computer gear, although it can be done, its harder as
those shops have probably been 'done' before.

Carding is fairly straightforward in the UK, with clean card numbers, an
adult voice :-), a good drop and intelligent collectors...
Hmm I have heard of a few people being busted but they are definitely in
the majority, people have even carded stuff to their own homes, signed for
it and kept it...
Don`t use the signature of the card holder if you have to sign anything,
pretent to be a brother/sister/boyfriend etc. because that way you get in
far less shit if caught...
When calling, a payphone or cellphone is prefereable ( hacked
cellphone...) but not essential...
When they say they will ring you back to confirm the order, most do, say
you are going down the pub or something and will phone them from the
payphone just outside when you get there, this prevents then having the
number you`re at...
ordering close to the Next Day Delivery deadline (always try to get Next
Day coz then there is less time for Fed type activity (if at all) and at
least you definitely know where/when the parcel will be) or just before
More..(Yes/No/Scroll)                     weekend closure is good as things get missed in the chaos of rushing
orders through...
A house where people work during the day, every day is ok, so either leave
a note, signed in the cardholders name accepting resposibility or (thanks
Si) faxing this through saying to leave it behind the porch or summat.
Preferably collect yourself to be sure, ie. hide in the garden, and be
walking out of the garden door when the delivery man turns up.
Getting it delivered to the address and then collecting it dressed as a
postman might also work...

Hmm the substance actually made from this process is Pseudoephedrine (I
think).
I`ll check it out and get back to you.  BTW be careful of any home made
drugs procedure, the proper procedure for meth is complicated and
utilises some very dangerous chemicals.

Hmmm, liquid nitro is expensive, could be stolen from your local uni
or hospital, but its not really a viable solution. (BTW it can be stored
in a plain old thermos flask in a kitchen freezer for a couple of weeks
before 'boiling' away to nothing.
 
 Have you considered 'nitromors' (may be a brand name, not sure)
its intended as a paint stripper, but will melt most thermoplastics, 
indeed it is often used to 'deal with' police riot shields ;-)

TRaP ZeR0, I read in a British newspaper yesterday that VISA are working
on a new system for their cards which includes a PIN type code.
Also, has anyone see those new VISA's with a photograph of the card owner
printed on the back? I expect in a few years VISA will have some hi-tech
shit like 'videophone customer identification' or 'voice verification'
before a card order/purchase can be completed.

093 - Modem (SUPTRACS system, says ready for input)
121 - Modem (Get series of 3 chars for a while)
133 - Modem (Use 7.E.1, Shaw Industries, get a login screen!)
134 - PABX (Audex Type)
137 - PABX (Welcomes ya to Freephone system, accepts voice, speedial,

Have a fuck around with these and i'll inform you of any more when I find
them. BTW all the 895xxx's are USA so if you sort one of the PABX's then

So far six cameras costing around 300,000 pounds each have been put into

The following is an exerpt from an article about hacking in general. It's
from the Scotlan-kb{ on Sunday paper. Tho, i grabbed it from my favourite
news computer. I can upload the entire article if someone's interested.
I've just posted the part about atm fraud. What do you guys think of it?
Is it really that easy to get rich in Scotland? PINs that work on any
account#?! Sounds like bullshit to me.. if not, i'll be heading for
Scotland instead of Holland.
 
   But money resides in cyberspace (only a fraction of it exists in the
   physical world) and money is the root of all the best ideas. John knows
   the hole-in-the-wall trick. This has banks all over the physical world
   shaking with rage - and fear. Using a cashline machine the criminal can
   draw money from someone else's account, providing he knows the account
   number (the PIN number is not necessary), and has a magnetic reader and
   programmer. This simple piece of technology retails legally for Pounds
   600.
   'You need some kind of plastic card, and I think the money-saver ones
More..(Yes/No/Scroll)                        from Total garages are the best,' explains John. 'Then you use the
   magnet programmer to put the account number on the card. You can get
   account numbers no problem; people often throw their receipts away
   around the cash machines. The PIN number has to be a real one, but just
   anyone's will do.'
   The money comes out of the account numbered on the card. The card has
   to be loaded with other numbers but they can be easily obtained by
   opening an account at the same bank. The only other detail is to avoid
   lifting the money from a machine which belongs to the same bank as the
   account. Contrary to bankers' claims, the machine will not notice that
   the PIN does not match the account number.

Would anyone with a fair knowledge of electronics be willing to construct a
portable blue box? I have a circuit from the USA which is simple to build
but will require a few minor modifications. i.e. must produce 2400/2600Hz
instead of 2600Hz and must produce KP2 instead of KP1. The timing on the
clear forward/sieze frequencies must also be correctly set.

Well this was a while ago and although I can`t remember what 0800 I was
using it was a very easy to seize one...
I tried those Sounds Activated Recorders, my Personal Stereo (a good
quaity Aiwa) and loadsa other things at payphones but I never managed to
seize at all...The volume waxs pretty loud but I suspect the tones lost
some accuracy in transition from computer speaker to tape.
Does anyone know the error margins on seizes? I mean presumably it doesn`t
have to be the exact tone to a billiom decimal points, although I am sure
that whatever it was the tones I recorded were outside this margin...

 Title: STUN-GUN
  From: Bigboy [35]
  Time: Thu Jul 22 00:02:26 1993

stun guns can be easily made from ionisers, DC. are best if you want it to
be portable. there is normally a large resistor which reduces the current
to a safe level, in case children touch the needle. Anyway if you remove
the resistor you will have a stun gun of sorts. Does anybody know what
current would be effective without danger?

ANother thing you can do with Ionisers that is handy is charge up a glass
of water .. just connect a wire from the probes of tyhe ioniser to the
glass of water .. power on .. wait a few minutes ... and just don`t touch
the water ... or I s`pose beer could work .. also hold on to a probe aqnd
switch on then shake hands with someone ... shocking ..

I think London would be an easier destination for the majority of people,
as a lot are based there and trains/buses to London are guaranteed

the black dot sounds like a cool place to have a meet.. 
this is avery hard desition to make ware we all should meet..
i thing we should have 3 meetings at the same time ...one in london
one some ware in scotland and one in nottingham...  people who live in
london have no prob to get around.. people like me and tgr can easly get
to london by train..( 9 squid return!!!) for people in scotland how about
edinborourgh or glasgow.... nottingham is good for peolpe in the
midalands and proberly some in wales...
we could join the confs together by some means...like alliance confs or
something.....all it takes is a bit of planning and this sould work..
what do ya think...
the best time for a meet whould be at the next half-term before that sad
christmas lark.
we also could set up some digitisers or ome thing!!!!

So it looks like it will be myself, The Grim Reaper and Boot again. I will
do a little price research and post some more information in the near
future. It will probably be sometime in early (Jan-Feb) 1994. A simple
phone call to Eric Corley (26oo Magazine) should get us some low cost
accomodation info and prices. I expect New York will have lots of sleazy
hotels and B&B style accomodation.
