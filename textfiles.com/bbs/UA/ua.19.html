Welcome back to Cyberspace.  

Please send all questions and help requests to 
valko@cyberspace.net.

*NOTE*
This site does not allow you to telnet to it.  You must use the 515
number for access.

If you have made an account since May 6th that seems to have disappeared,
it is because it has.  The paritition filled up and new account weren't
being saved.  The problem is fixed - just keep your new one.

Our sister site which handles USENET and other services hasn't been
feeling well.  I am fixing it, so services may be sluggish or
go down briefly for the next couple of days.

Some brief information is available on SLIP and PPP in /usr/local/notes

I know the modems are hosed.
Our USENET server is feeling a little better, but still suffers
   from fits every now and then ... I am working on the problem.   
Lynx and Gopher are now running.
