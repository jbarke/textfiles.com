and to ban all laws against it etc. Altho' I feel strongly about it, I
need some evidence sorta stuff so if anyone would like to recommend any
good books (I've got Cyberpunk and Beating The System) mail me.

I phoned up Wavetek in the states regarding their device that can
intercept Cell phone ESNs when a user places a call. Apparently the US
version is selling now ,but the U.K version will not be available for 6
weeks,that was six weeks ago, however. 1495 pounds or something for the uk
version ! 1495 dollars for the US version, bitches.

Regarding AT&T:-

I can't see British Telecom co-operating with AT&T not now and not for a
long time, although BT's relationship is much better with AT&T than it has
been for a long time, they are far from on friendly terms. Especially with
BT being able to buy a big stake in MCI recently and BT still trying to
stop AT&T buying into the UK market. I would most certainly worry about
abusing MCI now days but not AT&T.

METNET  uses a very advanced ansi method which also remains compatible with
the majority of terminal software. Metnet is the only UK BBS that uses
high speed animated Ansi.  Therefore if your on a long distance call, the
ANSI on Metnet will be no slower as the options appear before graphical
display, thus you get the best of all world's in one DELUXE menu set.

For that menu set please select '1'

                                LOGGING ON
                                賽賽賽賽賽

        To  log  onto  Metnet  you need a modem, a computer and a telephone
line  and  the  all  important  Communications  software  set to 8 bits, no
parity,  one  stop  bit,  abbreviated  as  8N1.  Load up your software, but
switch  on your computer first.  I will not go into great detail here as if
you can't load your software - you require help.

 Recommended Software:

            Amiga - Ncomm 2.0 FOR 1.3 or TERM 2.22 FOR 2.04
            Atari - FREEZETERM
            IBM   - Telex OR ODDYSSEY

  Once your software is loaded dial Metnet remembering which speed your
modem is and what line to use. So if your at 2400/2400 you should try
442251 first - OK?

  ATDT442251 if your using a HAYES modem.

  If at this stage you're not on Metnet then read your manual..

  If you have garbage at this point you are not set up correctly but if you
  wait and hit escape the screen might clear up.

  If it is busy then try another line. Alright?

  You connect and hopefully you log on.... Now you're obviously already a
user otherwise you wouldn't be reading this yet, so enter your name. Now it
would be easier if you remembered your ID number.  If you do not know your
ID number, use your name and contact sysop when you are at main menu. (sysop
= System operator - the big boss of Metnet). Press return once and enter
your password. If you loose your password then just type NEW at name prompt
and after a text file it will ask for :

Your Name? Guest

Put in 'Guest'

        You  can  then have guest access, and then page the sysop.  If I am
not  there  press  'G'  and leave a message to me on logout with your phone
number and I will phone you.

        Anyway  You  log on with your real password as you are not going to
lose it are you?

                   You may press CTRL-C to abort screens

        You  will  see  various intro screens..  If your screen has strange
characters  on  or  a  lot  of  garbage  then  you havn't set your software
correctly  or you are using the wrong menu set.  IE if your seeing [36m etc
that  means you are not using Ansi 8 colour when you should.  Do not use 16
colour  ansi..   Also you should use the full complement of VT100 otherwise
you will have scroll problems.  For some reason some IBM and ATARI packages
do  not  include the full VT100 set and thus it is the fault of the authors
for not doing so, and maintaining the computer wide standard of Vt100.

                                 IBM FONT
                                 --------

賽賽賽賽賽賽賽賽賽賽
I hope you are seeing a solid white line above.
If not then you havn't a IBM emulater font..
 You really must have that in order to enjoy
Metnet..

     --- I hope you just saw that in Cyan
 ------- this in yellow
 ------- and this red

If not then again contact Jon..

Whatever you receive.. If ok then fair enough, if garbage ignore for now
and just continue.

PS: The  "Press Escape" at start is for Fidonet mail purposes.


                            LOGGING ON PROBLEMS
                            賽賽賽賽賽賽賽賽賽

No connection? Engaged? - Someone else is using that line, keep trying, or
try  another line.....  If system is experiencing problems then I will have
an  announcement  up.   If several hours pass and it is just ringing and no
answer then call 449028 for a voice announcement.

Screen garbage - Your having line noise, pull other telephones out of your
sockets, take voice phone out of modem. check ALL connections and try
again. Make sure you are using RTS/CTS.

Other strange things happening - Remember to use 8N1 and the correct BAUD
rate for that line and set on yor modem, or rather remember not to set your
modem to 2400 if your modem can only do 1200. I assure you it will not
work.


You hear funny voices down the phone - You dialed the wrong number.

Let me know if you have other problems than those listed and I shall add to
list.

After a few text files you may see a BULLETIN MENU if that one is up...

                               BULLETIN MENU
                               賽賽賽賽賽賽

       The bulletin menu is a menu with system news and details. If it says
- No new bulletins sice last on' then just simply continue. If it lists
certain bulletins, then you MUST read these or become terrible out of touch
with the system, and missing extremely important anouncements that will
benefit you.  An ignorant person wouldn't read these... It is against
Metnet rules not to read the latest daily news.

                                 MAIN MENU
                                 賽賽賽賽

        METNET is the countries first fully animated ANSI system. You will
immediately see that Metnet is something special. A feature box showing
more detail and numeric options for user friendliness.  There are also
keywords and other special indexes for fast access to other areas.. See
other help file for information regarding those.

        The menu is animated and thus takes a long time to display. But you
have hotkeys and options appear first. So as soon as you know what you want
, then hit a key, but don't smash the keyboard in excitement. I know it is
different but don't get hysterical.  Unless your insured of course - cough.

  For system details and to see how to get around Metnet - just select
another helpfile. Option  '2'

   HOW TO CONTACT OTHER USERS OF METNET - KEEP IN TOUCH - ENJOY YOURSELF
   =====================================================================

Contacting others on Metnet can be an enterprising experience.  Not only is
it  enjoyable  it  can  be extremely useful.  Enhancing your knowledge on a
whole   variety   of  topics,  making  friends  or  just  straight  forward
communicating your precious document to another person.

  On Metnet you can chat to other users in 100 rooms, do it in private or
public.   Have  an  electronic chat with your friends across the country.
You  can  leave a message on Fidonet netmail and for a cost of a local call
you  can  be  in touch regularly .  Much cheaper than a voice call, and you
can send or retrieve - 24 hours a day....  Messages range from debate areas
to general chat....  Lets go through the idea of communicating on Metnet in
greater detail...



METNET IS MULTI USER AND INTERACTIVE
====================================

   The great advantage of Metnet over other systems , is because it is
Multi user with 10 persons online at the same time.

There are various multi user abilities as follows..


MULTI USER CONFERENCE
=====================

The multi user conference is available by selecting [C] from nearly every
menu.  It enables you to chat to others who are online in realtime. Once
entering you just get a clear screen and an intro title.

If you don't know what to do you just press

'/?'  on  left  side and you will see the help file as below..  Please note
that  advertising  of  any  kind  is  strictly  forbidden in the conference
area....as is bad language, defamatory remarks and any illegal discussion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 /?                                Help.
/Close                            Close the doors to this conference room.
/Hide [User]                      [User] won't be able to hear you.
/List                             List rooms.
/Open                             Open doors to a closed conference.
/MEssage [User]                   Send a private message to [User].
/MUffle [User]                    You won't hear [User]'s messages.
/Quit                             Quit back to the BBS.
/Room [X]                         Move to room [X].
/Time                             Shows current time and date and how long
                                  you have been on for.
/UNHide [User]                    [User] will be able to hear you again.
/UNMuffle [User]                  You'll hear [User] again.

"Flags" field with the "/List" command may contain:
$: Moderator                       G: Gagged
H: You are hiding from them        h: They are hiding from you
M: You are muffling them           m: They are muffling you

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's go through these commands now:

/? displays above file

/MEssage user..  abbreviated as /Me
==============

This is a vital command as it sends a message to a user on another line
instantaneously. To be used in conjunction with 'WHO IS ONLINE' - SEE
BELOW..

 Simply type from column 1....

              /me Fred Bloggs

It then asks you to input your message

              message: Hey come to chat now. I want to speak with you...

That message is then sent to his screen whereever he is on the board -
straight away..  Unless he is transferring files..... In those cases it
waits until completion....

-----------------------------------           -------------------------
/List  abbreviated as /l
.....

This command will list the current rooms and inform you who is inside them.

Please see Flags above, as they may appear next to a name..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Close

The close command will close the door to your room, and thus it will make
your chat into a private chat . You can let people in again by using:

/Open - Opens the door

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Hide

Allows you to prevent another user from hearing you. Just type

               /H fred bloggs

/Unhide will reveal your chat to the other user. Unhide is default..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Muffle [Fred Bloggs]

Is a user pestering you with his messages?  If so you can type /Muffle and
you will no longer receive his messages...

/UNmuffle [User]  is the reverse...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Time shows the current date and time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Q will quit chat and return you to Metnet..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Room x

Moves you to rooms numberd 1 -99

/Room 99

That would take you to Room 99..

=============================================================================

                    HOW DO I FIND OUT WHO IS ONLINE?
                    ===============================

SIMPLY PRESS 'W' FROM ANY MENU.........

You will then have a display of Who is online..

Name, Place of origin and where they are.. plus line number..

Please note that their location is not 100% accurate but states their last
location.... which the system registers..

==============================================================================

                              MESSAGES BASES
                              ==============

The place to communicate, with your messages being kept for quite a while
are in the message areas. You are alway notified of all mail to you on
logon. See Message help files for further information...


EMAIL SECTION MESSAGE ONE ...........                        PAGE'-23256'
-------------------------                                    賽賽賽賽賽

Electronic mail is a place to communicate with a friend locally. IE: In
order for the user you sent the message too, to read it - he/she will have to
call Metnet Triangle System, then he/she will be notified on logon and then
may reply to it in the same area, thus ensuring privacy. In other message
areas you can send private messages but the privacy on reply is not
default.

See message help files for further information

LOCAL MESSAGE AREAS
-------------------

Contact otheres in the local message areas. Debate, discuss, chat or just
query. Sending and reading local messages is great fun, very educational
and a highly useful, enjoyable activity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ECHOMAIL AREAS  ...........................................PAGE -21
==============

See message help area for further detail..

Echomail is national, European or even Worldwide distribution so you can
talk with others globally here on Metnet. Echomail areas have strict rules
which you must obey. Not my rules but Fido-net rules and I agree with them
mostly...

=============================================================================

ONLINE GAMES
============

  There are a multitude of games that use contact.. Multi user, Many enjoy
this method more than others. Please explore the game areas as I am sure
you will find it very good for your times of leisure.....

  Try Precious Days for full multi user interactivity.

=============================================================================

I hope the above demonstrates in brief the communication aspects of
Metnet..

Press return...

Short one liners          NUMERIC KEYWORD INDEX..
                          =====================


I Am positive this is a first for scrolled systems, to have a keyword index.

Remember  always  NEVER  to  miss the '-' out of keyword as that is so very
vital..

Remember  if  you  branch  off from a low number you are bound to stay with
topic  area.   For example -33 is Amiga section, so -331 -332 -333 are also
to do with Amiga as would be -33115.  You get the idea?

THESE  KEYS  WON'T  WORK  FROM  FILE MENU, MESSAGE MENU AND READING ROOM OR
DOORS AS THEY CANNOT BE MANIPULATED TO LINK....

IN  THOSE AREAS OTHER THAN DOORS YOU MUST ADD 'QQQ' TO THE FRONT BEFORE THE
DASH.  SO AMIGA AREA FROM THOSE PLACES WOULD BE 'QQQ-33'

Index  as  at  July  1st 1992.  Updated next around August 1st.  It quickly
becomes  out  of date as Metnet changes so fast.  Each month new and deleted
or moved parts will be notified to you.

Some parts of the index are in brief due to the quantity involved in
Metnet.

 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 Hi Musthaq

   Introducing the new Formula One Grand Prix Echo area! You'll find it in
   the normal message menu and it deals exclusively with Microprose's new F1GP
   Simulation. Read this echo for all the hints and tips, and to organize head
   to head competitions with other users. The BBS which originate's this Echo
   area also maintains a UK league table of race times... Read the echo for
   more info.

   Also, I'm away at the MultiMedia 93 Show at Earls Court. I didn't want to
   go, but duty calls... If any of you are going down, stop by our stand for
   some Live-ware Half Duplex interfacing. Unfortunately, this does mean that
   I probably won't get any of your mail until Friday the 18th or possibly
   the following Monday. I WILL answer, but it may take some time... Sorry!

   Finally, I've blown Yoav Zingher's USS Enterprise out of Empire!!! (making
   the game a safer place for the rest of us.) I'm sure he'll get me back!
   ...Marcel.
