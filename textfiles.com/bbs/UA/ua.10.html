News Update: Thursday 01-July-93

'Hacking at the End of the Universe (HEU)'

Hack-Tic have organised a three-day conference for computer hackers, phone
phreaks and techno-anarchists for only 100 dutch guilders (about 35.00 pounds
at the current exchange rate).

The event will be held at the Larserbos Campground, which is about 3 mile
southeast of Lelystad, or a 34 minute train ride from Amsterdam.

The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops on
hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual reality,
semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking, virusses, paranoia,
legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and elsewhere and much, much more.

If you would like more information about the event, contact Hack-Tic (24hrs)
Tel: +31 20 6001480, Fax: +31 20 6900 968 or Internet mail 'heu@hacktic.nl'.

yo widow,

a good book to read on the subject is "A handbook of computer security"
published by Kogan Page.

Not really a Pro hacking book but gives some good case studies of previous
hacks, ATM frauds, bank jobs etc.... Interesting anyway.

Is anyone else going to the 'hacking at the end of the universe'
conference in Holland? I will be driving to Harwich with The Grim Reaper
and Boot on the 3rd of August (11.30am ferry). Are any other UK subversives
making the effort? Three days packed with underground workshops, meetings,
conferences and the Party at the End of Time (PET) with 'smokes of assorted
types' available.

Hmm I am considering it it sounds like it might be the event to be at.
and sure as hell sounds a lot better than another weekend spent on the
internet. How many people are considering going from over here?

At the moment, myself, The Grim Reaper, Boot and Mark Bennet (editor of
Black Ice) seem to be the only U.K. attendees. It has only cost the two
users travelling with me 40.00 pounds each which is very good. The three
day event will cost 35.00 pounds which includes camp site, workshops,
party, etc. We hope to logon from the conference and let you all know about
the days events and upload an ASCII postcard.

The Grim Reaper, I decided to form -BuG- the British Underground Guild for
the few British hackers/phone phreaks/anarchists still active.

The reason for the 1:1 post/call ratio is simple. All non-contributing
user accounts will be deleted and UnAuThOrIsEd AcCeSs will become a
closed system. This will ensure a steady flow of information and only
those who support the system will remain.

Hi Boot!
Sounds good. How about virus info exchange/phreak (esp ISDN, does *any*one
do this?). Crypto system could be good too. Have you thought about all
peeps using PGp??

hi ,yes me bbs will have many more unusual features..a virus exchange is
something that im working on at the moment..geting alot from the u.s and
eastern europe...i am also thinking of using some sort of new loging on
prosess but i havent made up me mind yet..(it might be some sort of
"soft key"...maybe im dreaming.....
But the main thing about me bbs is that it will be only english phreaking
info..maybe some u.s cell stuff but a hole new load of cell stuff  from
the u.k that i have been colecting...
i whould like to hear from anyone who wants something different.....
hopefully i will have two basestations one in north lincolnshire and one
in oxfordshire, and hopefully set up a sorta message network!

Hmm I think you should use PgP, that`s probably what i`ll use if I d{
decide to encrypt...
Does anyone know a good source of amiga virii?
I`m up for a network when I get my bbs sorted...but what networking
protocol to use?

Only if it's a lousy tap you will notice a voltage drop. And even then
it's not very reliable.

I just can't understand why they charge 100 guilders for it. What happened
to the "Freedom of Information" thing?

Anyone here know anything about this new IBM-connected service ..
supposedly like compuserve but with access to on-line Maps etc.. and loads
more .. apparently IBM are going to push it quite hard as they are fitting
some device in their computers allowing you to connect ... DOes anyone
know anything els eabout it ..technology etc.. cos it may be worth trying
to hack if its on-line .. it starts up sometime in begining of next year
Will Post More If I Can Find Anything

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one.

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
