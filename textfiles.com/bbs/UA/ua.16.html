'WaReZ D00dz'. I am sure most other users of this system would agree.

I think any inclusion of warez info could be bad news, underground systems

probably a good idea to steer clear of both.

Boot, why do you need to use 'awib' to scan for 0800-890-XXX blue box
lines? I just dial each number in series and send 2400/2600, 2400/2400Hz
and make a note of each successful sieze. I currently know of 15-20 lines
which accept CCITT5 routing.

Is it possible to move house and keep the same telephone number provided
you do not move outside your local area code? I know this service is
available in the USA and I would like to keep this bulletin board system
running on 063-670-T0NE (amazing really, but its true).

Also, as the cost of installing a phone line is dropping to 99.00 pounds
after Christmas I was wondering if re-connecting an existing socket will
become cheaper (but don't hold your breath).

Bigboy, warez people are fucking loosers who think modems were invented to
transfer pirate software and nothing else. I would also like to mention
that most people envolved in the warez scene are lame bastards who spend
all day copying software so they can tell their lame contacts how elite
they are. UABBS is not a 'WaReZ D00Dz' bulletin board and I do not want
leeching X-copy fanatics on this system.

Hi. I am going to start up a new h/p BBS in London. I need some advise on

registering. :( TGR or !BOOT.... are yah interested in a linkup kind of
thing between our 'to be' BBSs? Mr Phantasm suggested that we call it

Datastream Cowboy, is Elite for the IBM written by Nick Smith? What
version is available? I spoke to him towards the end of 1992 when he was
moving from San Fransisco to Australia. Version .51 was the last version
released for the Amiga and several functions were not complete...i.e.
game doors, multi-nodes, conference room, etc.

Its nice to see all these people discussing new UK based h/p/a
bulletin boards but I wonder how many will actually start and how long
they will remain online.

BTW: Did anyone notice how quickly Alex Coe's bbs telephone number
(071)237-3329 went down?

Sure why not...erm I agree with Phantasm about warez doodez, there are
loadsa boards around the world dedicated to shite warez, so lets keep this
board free of wank like that...
Erm a UK network sounds good, although its possible that if I run a BBS
(still not 100% convinced it is worth it in this country) it will be
hooked up to some US bbs for a message transfer....
As for Alex Coe, fuck him. He deserves whatever he gets.

Hmm RE: Iceland 890354

It used to call worldwide via sattelite but a while back (1yr or so) it
died you can seize it easily but when you try KP2 it just gives you a
message in various languages. You used to be able to Bypass this by doing
KP1+09+COUNTRYCODE+NUMBER+ST  ;->
But that stopped working also but i aspect if you try KP1+ XX + etc etc
And replace the XX with 2 digits you will eventually find the right code.
i would do it myself but got no time at the moment.. Let me know if you
have any luck...

Boot, why don't you include IFF format diagrams with your next release of
the t-lockpick file? ASCII is very limited and I am sure most people would
rather work from IFF or GIF format diagrams.

Black Death, most American scanners will work fine as long as you enter
the number in the correct format. i.e. 063-670-8063 if 0636-708063 is not
possible. Phone Empire BBS on b103013842482c if you require MS-Dos WarGames

 Anyway, you should find a large list of uptodate backups, the list
has a LOT of PC/Amiga/Mac warez on it.

I cant seem to tie down the opening hours of this node, seems a bit

Has anyone got a method for defeating satellite encryption which actually
works in the United Kingdom? I am sure this is still possible if people are
still recieving free cable and satellite television in the United States.

I have a lot of Pwords/usernames to post very soon, HOLD tight and have
your hacking hats at the ready, A few JANET hacks and a few Internet Hacks
. I have already hacked ROOT/SYSTEM on alot of them, so they might be
usefull, what about setting up a BBS on a JANET sight, BTW Can you create
hidden dirs in VMS? Perhaps by Modifying the file headers?

Oh, and can someone upload a cool bug schematic?

The internet site-BBS idea is a cool one...I have some nice bbs software
for unix actually, somewhere...and some utils with it that hide it from
the process list and so on, so if someone does a ps -ux'ON^vxx etc. they
can't see anything under the bbs account, and it's also hidden from
'who's....I'll dig it out...btw: I might post up a list of US DoD internet
sites if anyone's interested? not a lot of luck so far, but maybe someone
else might hit the jackpot! ;)

I don`t wanna be a killjoy but when there are no default accounts things
are gonna be pretty bad unless you have physical access to the sight (for
shoulder-surfing, login captures etc.).
Maybe it is worth finding out the company/establishment that owns it and
doing a bit of social engineering, it couldn`t hurt...
Incidentally, descriptions of many OS security flaws can be found in the
security section of the News (*or summat) area on NIC.DDN.MIL
There is loadsa stuff about Sun security weaknesses etc., nothing
incredibly detailed but summat to give you a basic starting point.
Sorry I couldn`t help more...

As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it appears that the enemy
has gained a major victory. Scores of people raided, many arrested, some
in jail, bulletin boards seized, the casualties are many. Today it is
almost impossible to find any hack/phreak board, let alone a decent one.

Everyone is laying low, information is scarce. When asked almost everyone
is "retired". Our world is on hold, and has been on hold for what seems
like an eternity. The Phrack trials, Operation Sun Devil, and a dozen
other events have struck a major blow against our way of life, and
caused paralysis. Just like in the real world, the hack/phreak world is
experiencing a recession of its own.
