User shtuff
-----------
   The fields shouldn't be labeled handle, password, etc.  Instead they
   should be String[1..n]  Int[1..n] etc.   This makes them easily
   redefinable and MUCH easier to write an editor for.  A file of
   names attached to each one can be set up, just like a file giving
   names to each of the perms.  This way someone editting a user can
   pick a field by #/whatever and you just prompt for the appropriate
   type and wallah.   Some of these things will be user definable on
   line and the code should not be huge brute force type shit.

                NewUser?   (cleared manually by sysop or with external
                            user editor - this might be covered using
                            status or one of the perms)

   Eventually a login script, logout, file of games saves/records/points.

   When deleting a user, all mail, buffers, scripts, etc should also be
   wiped.

Notes - heres some of my thoughts
-----
   I don't like questions.  In a lot of places in genesis you press
   an option and it asks you ten things before it works.  Like the
   [R]egistered users thing.  YOu have to hit R, L, L before you get
   what you want.

   The new software should have options that are preset and can easily
   be toggled / changed, but always a go key only one level deep.  Using
   the Registered users example.  R should pull up a menu with all the
   sort and select information set with default values, and key to
   start listing with the current setups.
--
   The way genesis gets accounts is atrocious.  For new users its full
   of ambiguous questions.

   For each field it fills, the screen should clear and a brief
   description of what the user should answer is given (not just a prompt)
   followed by a prompt.  If a CR / blank entry is recieved a meaty
   help should pop up.

   For terminal selection ask the user what computer type and assume line
   feeds and screen width.  Next if they have color, then if they are
   emulating a certain terminal type (again the brief description would
   ward off new users and a beefy help if they enter something incorrect
   or the user wants more info.

Multiline
---------
   How is this going to be done?  To make it multiline, there needs to
   be some fancy interrups or more realistically, make it event driven.
   This means there needs to be a separate record of global variables
   for each active port.  Uh.


  Send - decides to where : local if local logon or watching
                            what port etc (even if not multiline)
                            to screen dump if active
  Send file - handles messages, bulletins, menus, everything
  Send string - handles emulation of terminals, color, etc.
  Send local - handles local emulation (color at least, portability? :-)
  Send char - drops characters into the io buffers.


Someday
-------
   Mini-networking.  Able to send mail to local BBS or remote systems.çãÖ˝   Not conferencing, just mail.  If a letter could be transferred to
   the DMG, for instance, from there it might be able to hop on a fido
   net (since there is none here) or FUBAR and onto internet and on to
   the rest of the world.
   If only PC Persuit would come to town.
