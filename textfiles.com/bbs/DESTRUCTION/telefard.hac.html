Got low access?
Hate that stupid SysOp?
Want some new warez?
THIS IS HOW!
 
Hey, look, Telegard, great BBS software, everyone loves it, and it even has 
three ways to prevent leeching, one, Upload/Download ratio, Percentage ratio, 
and File points.  Well, I don't know how to avoid any of those, just don't be 
a leech.  But, you do want to get into that semi-private SysOp stuff, right?  
This file will teach you how, and you won't get caught, well, unless the sysop 
watches you.  Now, beware Telegard sysops, you might want to switch software 
after reading this.  There is always a SysOp directory, directory 0.  That is 
where all the files that you upload with a \ in front of the description.  The 
advantage into getting to this stuff is that the sysop may not want to put it 
up for all the leeches to get, but, you still want it.  Okay, now, have at 
least 10 or 20 file points, if you plan to do a lot of stealing.  Now, from 
any directory in the file menu, type U for Upload.  Now, it will ask for the 
file name, type "X.ZIP".  Now, it will ask for a description, type \a, then it 
will ask for a verbose description, answer no.  Now, protocol menu, after 
this, type q for quit (abort) upload.  Bingo!  Right into the SysOp directory.  
This may not always work, unless Telegard is modified, which I have heard is a 
bitch.  If you find anything good, leave me E-Mail on whatever board I am on, 
I am always glad to hear about those files you stole.  Oh, and, one you get 
into the sysop directory, be choosy, there is no rush on what you need to 
download..
