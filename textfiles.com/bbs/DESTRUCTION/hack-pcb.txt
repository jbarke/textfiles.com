  ด In the past few months many sysops have turned away from FORUM  ร
  ณ HACKS to Pcboard. Why you might ask? Well it is a very simple   ณ
  ณ question to answer. Pcboard is 100% more configurable than any  ณ
  ณ FORUM HACK out there. Anybody with a little programing backroundณ
  ด can write their own PPE's. Many of the authors have included    ร
     backdoors in their own PPE's to prevent sysop's to get away
  ๚  with not registering. Now here where I come in.  I am running    ๚
  ๚  a board of my own (PCboard of Course) and I go into PWAFV where  ๚
  ณ  it asks for a file name, so I just tried to type any file from   ณ
  ณ  there. (Ex. %C:\SHIT.TXT) To my surprise THe file was typed!!!   ณ
  ณ  to the screen, but that's nothing. I Logged onto The Deep, A     ณ
  ณ  305 Phoenix board, And paged Great White the sysop. So I told    ณ
  ณ  him about that little BUG(?) in PWAFV and at the time he was     ณ
  ณ  setting up Slogon 2.0 from ViGilante, I told him he could put    ณ
  ณ  it in a Script file so that the board would run it. That's where ณ
  ณ  it came together, Slogon writes a textfile for the AUTOMESSAGE.  ณ
  ณ  If you plug in %C:\PCB\MAIN\USERS in the AUTOMESSAGE when you    ณ
  ณ  Logoff, you can call back and when you get to see the            ณ
  ณ  AUTOMESSAGE what you see is the USERLIST with all the users      ณ
  ณ  PASSWORDS including the first one the sysop's account. From thereณ
  ณ  you hang up, call back, and logon as the sysop and when your at  ณ
  ณ  the main menu run 9 and go to DOORWAY from there do what you     ณ
  ณ  think would be nice. Another way is to run a PPE from the AUTO-  ณ
  ณ  MESSAGE. Instead of the % you enter !C:\PCB\PPL\EXAMPLE.PPE      ณ
  ณ  you could run a USER EDITOR, or whatever tickles your dick.      ณ
  ณ                                                                   ณ
  ณ  To the Sysops that run Pcboard, Well any PPE that lets a user    ณ
  ณ  input text and then display it is a risk. Just go through your   ณ
  ๚  PPE's and check them out. As for Slogon 2.0 Just edit LINE 2     ๚
  ๚  of SLOGOFF.CNF so that it doesn't include the AUTOMESSAGE as a   ๚
     choice to the users. I already tried to execute and display files
     from the DIR.LST file and it didn't work and I also tried it from
     PWA's AUTOSIG Utility, And a few other PPE's and it didn't work.
     But there are plenty more PPE's that have this fault.
