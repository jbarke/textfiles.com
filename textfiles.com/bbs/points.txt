         This  listing  contains  the  BBS  sysop's  who mailed in the
         FORM.TXT file.  This file will be included in every issue  of
         ZIP  Magazine.  ZIP Magazine will try to call these BBS's and
         upload each and every issue we put out.  Most of these  BBS's
         are  very  busy,  as  we have not been able to get through to
         them.  So dear sysop, if we do not get ZIP Magazine  to  you,
         could you or one of your callers please call in and get which
         ever  issue  is  needed.   ALSO  SYSOP'S WHO APPLY, COULD ZIP
         MAGAZINE HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE EXTRA  NODES.   This  should
         make  it  easier for us to upload it to you, so you or one of
         your users will not have to do the work.  Another  thing,  if
         any  of the below information is incorrect, or needs updated,
         please call ZIP BBS with the desired changes.  And  last  but
         not  least,  I am probably leaving something out.  So I'll go
         ahead and apologize for my future mistakes. Thanks to all  of
         you ZIP Magazine supporters!
