                     Welcome to the ThoughtScape of MindVox

  Since you have arrived at this nexus point within Cyberspace, you presumably
  have at least a basic idea of what we are, and what you expect to find here.
  You may have read an article by or about one -- or some --  of  us,  seen  a
  clip,  attended  a  conference,  or just taken a spin through the electronic
  landscape to see what fate had in mind.

  Whatever has brought you here, you want to find ...something.  It  might  be
  as  simple as the latest stock quote or a piece of shareware, or it could be
  as complex and all-encompassing as trying to give your life some  new  level
  of understanding that allows you to find peace of mind.

  Chances are that for most of you, what you desire lies somewhere between the
  two  absolutes delineated by NeW WaReZ and online therapy.  Although MindVox
  is suitably equipped to supply just about anything you may desire, it's pri-
  mary focal point isn't shareware, or junk that can be found on ftp sites and
  PC boards spread throughout the land.

  MindVox is a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to a wide variety of topics,
[7m-- more --[m

  and  contains a vast collection of archives that house information on every-
  thing from software updates, viruses, security news, drug information, legal
  issues  effecting  Cyberspace,  and electronic digests and anthologies . . .
  all the way to a constantly growing library that chronicles the very  incep-
  tions  of  Cyberspace, with timeslices of systems dating all the way back to
  1979 -- the first bulletin boards ever to exist.

  MindVox runs on pretty complex, custom software  that  makes  everything  as
  easy to use as possible.  The system itself is in a constant state of change
  as we make improvements, implement your suggestions, fix  problems  stemming
  from  complaints,  and generally evolve the state-of-the-art in online tech-
  nology.

  We're running on an expensive collection  of  hi-tech  toys,  with  a  lotta
  modems,  workstations,  hard  disks, terminal servers and bandwidth.  We are
  BeTTeR, NeWER, FLASHIER, SHinY, BrIGHT and Cheaper ThaN almost  anything  on
  earth, or in outer space for that matter.

  Although this is really neato, our long-term goal is to move everything onto
  an  MSDOS  based  machine, purchase a big house in the suburbs, and fill the
  basement with roughly a hundred 386s and a real big air conditioner.

  The closest tangible structure that  MindVox  could  be  likened  to,  is  a
  sprawling  Tavern  at  the crossroads of the entire world.  Whether you have
  jacked into Vox by dialing a local number with your modem,  or  stacked  to-
  gether  a  web  of net connections that spans the world, you have arrived --
  and while you might make use of the facilities provided, chances are  you're
  not here 'cuz you want to flip through an online multimedia encyclopedia, or
  because you're on a quest for that elusive copy of  MegaTerminal  92.7Y  NOW
  SUPPORTING NEON ANSI MODE and V.FAST!

  You're here because you want to interact with people that you won't find  on
  any  other  system  --  pioneers in the fields of computer science, science-
  fiction, music, the arts, religion, altered states, and future realities  --
  writers,  musicians, artists, programmers, designers, directors, actors, en-
  trepreneurs,  business-people,  politicians,  chemists,  body-builders,  and
  Elvis.

  You're bored with the cookie-cutter tract houses that litter the  electronic
  landscape  with  copies  of  copies.  All featuring the same thing, with the
  same environment and the same people.  Your cruise  through  the  Datasphere
  has brought you to our gates because it's more interesting to hang out in an
  experimental theatre, recording studio, occult bookstore, headshop, R&D  lab
  or  club,  with  people you read about; than a 7-11, with people you're sick
  and tired of.

  Technology has created one of the most unique possibilities in  the  history
  of  human interaction; Anytown USA can jack into Haight-Ashbury in the 60's,
  Soho in the 70's, any place or time that has ever been and places that never
  were and exist only by mutual wish-fulfilment . . .

                   MindVox is a celebration of possibilities

                     Jack In, Rock Out and Feed your Head!

Setting  the  proper  terminal  emulation  can  greatly simplify  your  online
existence.   The  two most  common  selections  are  VT100  and ANSI.  In fact
these settings are SO  common, that if your terminal  program doesn't  support
them, you either  have a  REALLY  old machine, a  REALLY bad terminal program,
or are  calling into  MindVox via  Intergalactic relay from  Alpha Centuri. If
your  communications  software  doesn't  support  terminal  emulation, specify
it as "unknown".

                 -=/[ MindVox Payment Policies: The Plans ]/=-


         [PLAN I:  MindVox Membership]  [Pricing: $10.00 / per month]

  These accounts are usually used by people who telnet into MindVox from other
  sites.   It  assumes  that  you already have Internet services since you are
  getting here through the net in the first place.  With this in mind, PLAN  1
  is designed to give you all of MindVox's SITE-SPECIFIC features without mak-
  ing you pay for redundant options that you already have access to elsewhere.

  This includes access to the Archives, various Games and  Simulations,  Mail,
  the  Chat  areas, and the MindVox Forums.  It DOES NOT include access to the
  Usenet Newsgroups, IRC, Telnet and Software Transfers.

         [PLAN II:  InterNet Services]  [Pricing: $10.00 / per month]

  This option is designed for most of our local  clients,  whose  primary  in-
  terest  in  the MindVox system is as an easy-to-use gateway to the InterNet.
  The VOICES software provides a simple-to-use, yet  powerful  interface  that
  sits  on  top of Unix, and allows you to make use of services without having
  to learn arcane commands.

  Plan  II  Accounts  include  an  Internet   Mailbox   in   the   format   of
  NAME@mindvox.phantom.com,  access to roughly 1700 newsgroups in Usenet News,
  entry to the local Chat system, FTPmail Software File  Transfers, as well as
  access to various online games.  IT DOES NOT include access to:  The MindVox
  Forums, most sections of The Archives, IRC, Telnet and some of the available
  Simulations.

        [PLAN III:  Full Membership]  [Pricing: $15.00 / per month]

  You want it all, everything!  Combines all the features of  MindVox  in  one
  easy to digest, low-calorie, fat-free package that gives you complete access
  to everything that exists on MindVox.

  You get the mystique of Vox, where you can cavort in a beautiful virtual en-
  vironment  populated by a stellar collection of people who get thrown off of
  every other system in Cyberspace; those in attendance include  some  of  the
  luminaries  of Cyberpunk literature; the dregs of the art world; out of work
  movie people who will offer you glamorous jobs for no pay;  ex-hackers  from
  LOD,  KOS, and a dozen other affiliations, who played as major role in shap-
  ing the development of Cyberspace over the last  decade;  government  people
  from all kinds of neat three-letter acronyms who have put quite a few of the
  afore-mentioned crowd through the processes of our delightful legal  system;
  lawyers and legislators who want to discuss the deep inner meaning and truth
  behind what the hackers did, what the goverment does, and what it all really
  means anyway; people who take too many drugs and then write about it; people
  who can't stand people who take drugs; a bunch  of  reporters,  journalists,
  and  media  people, all gathered here to watch what all the other groups are
  doing; if all this wasn't enough, there's also Elvis AND MONDO 2000  --  to-
  gether again, almost, for the first time.

  And when you grow tired of your Vox fix, you can go  read  Usenet  news  and
  spend  the  next week logged into IRC without ever leaving.  What more could
  you ask for?  Quit your job and jack-into MindVox for the rest of your life.
  It's absolutely spiffy

  The Bandwidth Forum is here to discuss all those things that just don't  fit
  into  the  topic-oriented forums. Like, for example, a discussion of hot new
  silicon might naturally lead some of you to a discussion of who has had sil-
  icone  injections.  Bring  it over here when it gets off-topic; there are no
  off-topic topics in Bandwidth. Also, this will be the place  where  you  can
  begin  discussions  on  one subject and have them branch out in billions and
  billions of directions. Who knows that path it'll take?  Join  in  and  help
  figure it out.

       Prelude
       -------

            This article has its inception in several dozen people  ask-
       ing the same questions with fairly consistent regularity.  Namely
       those of, "where'd you guys go?", "what's the deal with MindVox?"
       and "what have you been doing for the last five years anyway?"

            Overture does a decent job of tying up all of the above  and
       then some, while providing a general overview about who we are at
-- more --                        Phantom Access and what we're in the process of doing with  Mind-
       Vox.   Sections  of  this article self-plagiarize heavily from my
       own writings in ENTROPY CALLING, which will be in a form suitable
       for  publication sometime around the first quarter of 1993 at the
       rate things are going right now.  My apologies for the perpetual-
       ly  blown  deadlines  regarding  this  work, but something always
       manages to pop up that requires my full attention, in  this  case
       MindVox itself.

            I've done what I could to make everything understandable  by
       even  those  who  have no prior knowledge of who we are or what's
       going on, hopefully I have  at  least  partially  succeeded.   If
       something  is  briefly  touched upon and you don't understand its
       significance, then it  probably  means  something  to  a  smaller
       cross-section of people and you can safely ignore it.

            While this is in many respects a personal account of my  own
       journey  through  Cyberspace  and  what  it has meant to me and a
       handful of my friends, on a larger scale the underlying theme and
       basic  premise  of  how  the  electronic  universe  began and has
       evolved is reflective of the experiences of countless people  who
       have  been traversing the endless pathways of possibility with me

       First Light 
       -----------

       A long time ago, in a thoughtspace far away, an event that  would
       forevermore alter the shape of human interaction took place . . .

       But we're not here to talk about that, instead we're  gonna  dis-
       cuss  computers  and how a couple of guys named Ward Christianson
       and Randy Seuss wrote a program that would allow them to  be  set
       up  as  a  kind of store-and-forward messaging system designed to
       allow their circle of friends to interact with one another by us-
       ing  these  things  called  modems . . . and how this event would
       prove to be the first truly accessible step  into  the  uncharted
       territory of what was to become Cyberspace.

       From this empowering turning point in  the  late  seventies,  the
       ideas,  dreams and fantasies that would transmute and amplify hu-
       man potentials and evolutionary possibilities, broke  loose  from
       the  shackles that primitive technology had imposed upon them and
-- more --                        began to spin the electronic universe into existence.

       Still in the very early stages of its development, Cyberspace, or
       the  "modem  world" as it is sometimes called, has until very re-
       cently remained a largely untapped forum unique within the histo-
       ry  of our world.  It is a rapidly shifting microcosm that in the
       early part of the 1990's seems poised to engulf the reality  from
       which  it  was born, weaving together the threads of tens of mil-
       lions of diverse dreams, into one mercurial tapestry that  encom-
       passes the collective consciousness of humanity and frees it from
       all constraints.

       The non-space of Cyberspace is a place where global changes  that
       would  take years or even centuries outside of the online domain,
       can occur in weeks or months.  It is a place  where  participants
       from  all  over  the  world share a unique common-ground based on
       nothing less nor more, than a belief in the same vision of possi-
       bility.   It is a land where people who scoff at "The Elements of
       Style" frequently write paragraphs, pages, and even novels,  full
       of big words, huge concepts, and absolutely gargantuan amounts of
       emoting -- while actually saying nothing tangible.  In  a  little
       over a decade, the online microcosm has managed to experience the
-- more --                        equivalent of hundreds of years of evolution.  Not to mention the
       creation of hundreds of words which have found their way into the
       online lexicon despite the fact that nobody is  quite  sure  what
       they mean in the first place.

       During this turbulent period of rapid change the half-dozen  sys-
       tems  of 1978, had grown to 45 or 50 electronic villages by 1980.
       These were the original outposts of Cyberspace, running on hacked
       together  systems, hooked into industrial 8" drives, and network-
       ing at the blinding speed of  110  baud.   To  be  honest,  there
       wasn't  really  a whole lot of high level philosophizing going on
       regarding the brave new world that had dawned.  Actually, most of
       the  conversation  tended  to focus on things along the lines of,
       "How do you hook an 8" drive onto an Apple ][?"  and  "ANY  idiot
       can  see  that  setting  the  7th bit high on the xdef reg is the
       WRONG thing to do, OF COURSE it'll make the  program  crash,  are
       you  stupid  or  something?"  It was a technological triumph, but
       one that was for the most part, still lacking  many  of  the  key
       participants that would shape the technology into designer reali-
       ties.

       As the seventies drew to a close, the  sterility  and  bare-bones
-- more --                        functionality that had predominated, began to make way for places
       created by people who truly  wanted  something  unique  and  dif-
       ferent.   The mere existence of the technology was no longer that
       exciting, and as a greater number of people gained access to  the
       hardware  needed to jack in, the first electronic tribes gathered
       and began erecting monuments to their own ingenuity.

       By the time the eighties were upon us,  the  handful  of  systems
       that  had  thrived  during the latter half of the previous decade
       had multiplied rapidly, giving birth to new systems on an  almost
       daily  basis, and by 1982 there were close to a thousand outposts
       on the frontier.  Hardware prices were  falling,  1200bps  modems
       were  actually within the reach of many people who wanted to pur-
       chase them, and the online domain was beginning to attract a wide
       variety of participants from outside the technocratic elite.

       A second pivotal point came during the summer of  1983  when  the
       movie  WARGAMES  was  released.   Within several months the modem
       world literally doubled in size.  An  entire  new  generation  of
       people  were  about to take the plunge into electronic wonderland
       and set off an explosive growth rate that has  not  slowed  since
       then.  It was a major and irreversible nexus point that would be-
-- more --                        gin the abrupt transition from taking Cyberspace from  the  realm
       of underground sub-culture to the forefront of mainstream media.

       In retrospect the early eighties were the "golden age" of  Cyber-
       space.  There truly was a new frontier just over the horizon, and
       we were standing at the edge.  This period in the history of  the
       electronic universe was unruly and chaotic, the first settlers on
       the frontier wouldn't arrive for another decade or  so,  and  the
       only  people  here  were a small collection of explorers eager to
       embark on the next adventure.

       Of course one of the problems with "standing on the edge" of any-
       thing,  is  the  trail that led up to it.  You are there for some
       reason, or usually a very complex series of  reasons,  that  have
       shaped  your  life up until that point in time, and caused you to
       become disenchanted with -- or feel limited by -- whatever situa-
       tion  you  are  locked into in the consensual reality that we all
       physically inhabit at present.  In other words, the "real  world"
       isn't making you happy, and you want outta there.

       Led by a an oddball contingent of misfits,  dropouts,  acidheads,
       phreaks,  hackers,  hippies, scientists, students, guys who could
-- more --                        say "do0d, got any new wares?" with a straight  face  and  really
       mean  it -- and quite often -- people who managed to combine many
       of these attributes; the 1980's saw the rise of the first empires
       and kingdoms of Cyberspace.

       As romantic and wonderful as this seems, and was . . . a  lot  of
       the people involved had been brutalized by life, and much of this
       new reality was borne out of a tidal wave of pain  and  dissatis-
       faction.  When I first became an active participant in this elec-
       tronic nervous system that was just beginning to  experience  its
       awakening;  I  was  a little over ten years old.  My early under-
       standings of what this "place" was, were shaped by a  handful  of
       people  whose  skills  I admired and sought to emulate, yet whose
       lives I felt great pity and sadness for.

       There were of course exceptions, people who were so high  on  the
       potential  of  this  technology  and  the completely new level of
       reality it could bring, that nothing more than a  love  of  their
       creation drove them onwards.  But these people were pretty uncom-
       mon, most of the pioneers were guys who were simply unhappy . . .
       or to be more exact, so unhappy that they had given up on finding
       joy in the "real world"  and  were  constructing  a  rocket  ship
-- more --                        called Cyberspace to get them out of here as fast as possible.

       "Peace, love and happiness" was not  exactly  the  driving  force
       behind the rise of the electronic domains.  A more realistic ral-
       lying cry was one of "Gee this technology is neat, and I'm  gonna
       use it to make a whole new world where I can be happy and none of
       you can ever bother me again.  You'll all be sorry, just wait and
       see!"   They  were  building  the  cult of high technology in the
       hopes that it would somehow save them from whatever they  thought
       had prevented them from attaining happiness anywhere else.

       Sadly enough "they" were not THOSE PEOPLE, "they" had become "us"
       and  while the first steps into this place had been made possible
       by the phone phreaks and misfits of yesterday, the  online  world
       was exploding and changing at an incredible velocity, the rest of
       society was about to take notice in a big way, and a  handful  of
       disenfranchised  teenagers  had seized the reigns and were in the
       early stages of walking into the spotlight and taking the  status
       quo for a big ride . . .


       The Fall 
-- more --                        --------

       Everything really was this big beautiful game, and here  we  were
       with an overview of the whole jigsaw puzzle, and the sudden power
       to do anything we wanted to do with it.  For the  first  time  in
       recent  history you COULD reach out and change reality, you could
       DO STUFF that effected EVERYTHING and EVERYONE, and you were sud-
       denly  living  this  life  that was like something out of a comic
       book or adventure story.  In a place filled  with  magical  lands
       and  fantastic  people  who you had only read about, and suddenly
       you WERE actually talking to Timothy Leary,  or  Steven  Wozniak,
       and some guy who was just on the cover of a magazine was speaking
       with you and thought that YOU were cool,  and  then  finally  you
       were  IN  the  magazines  and  at the forefront of an entire sub-
       culture that was being  rapidly  assimilated  into  the  cultural
       mythos.

       It was a VERY interesting time and place in which to grow up.

       Of course the problem is a lot of us didn't grow up.  At  a  cer-
       tain  point in time having power that can have real and immediate
       effects upon all society, can do very strange things to your per-
-- more --                        spective of the world.  Instead of learning to deal with the nor-
       mal barriers that most teenagers in western  culture  find  them-
       selves  faced  with, you discover that you can blow right through
       all of them without even slowing down.  In this way you miss much
       of the growth and acclimation that people go through during their
       teenage years.  Which is where a lot of old friends  parted  ways
       with  reality  and  ceased to be explorers, becoming caught up in
       the real world implications of the power that was  now  at  their
       disposal.   In  effect,  they  lost sight of the underlying theme
       that all our actions had been based upon, that of exploration and
       pushing  the  boundaries,  and  merely  focused on the short-term
       end-result of what their abilities could bring them;  in the pro-
       cess  becoming  the criminals that the Secret Service and FBI had
       said we all were.

       What had begun with the best intentions, as the  ultimate  exten-
       sion  of  human  curiosity, had devolved into a cultural movement
       that had very little to do with the ideals that had inspired  it.
       The term "hacker" had become synonymous with "criminal", and tak-
       ing a look around at the state of the underground, it  looked  as
       if  much  of  it  had  in  fact  degenerated  into  crime cartels
       comprised of angry teens who  had  little  understanding  of  the
-- more --                        underlying  mechanisms  they were employing to play with reality.
       It was no longer the exhilaration of knowing that you could actu-
       ally  reach  out  and touch a satellite . . . it had come down to
       the negative power trip of fucking with something for the sake of
       pissing  people  off or just showing the world how much power you
       really have at your disposal if you ever decided to throw a  tan-
       trum.

       By 1988 what had replaced our outlook, was a  mindset  where  the
       new  generation saw two things:  one of them was the potential to
       take advantage of holes in the system for personal  gain.   There
       was  no  longer any quest for knowledge, desire to learn, or need
       to push the boundaries of what was possible for the sake  of  ex-
       ploration.   Instead  there were a lot of people who couldn't get
       past making free phone calls, stealing things, and causing  trou-
       ble  by  following  an already well-established pattern of action
       and reaction.

       The second -- and perhaps biggest -- motivating factor had become
       the   desire   for  personal  attention  in  the  form  of  self-
       aggrandizement: the ultimate hack had become  the  media  machine
       itself.  What was originally a by-product of our experiences, had
-- more --                        become a goal in and of itself.  And here is where things  became
       REALLY twisted.

       The media in the latter half of the twentieth century has  become
       a very strange distortion of reality instead of the reflection it
       was intended to be.  Since this is not an essay on the  evils  of
       manipulation  through  the use of media, I will stick with a very
       simple outline of how events occur in the real world.

       A reporter, journalist, writer -- SOME PERSON who has  their  own
       desires and ambitions, wants to do an exciting story on something
       that will garner him or her  a  lot  of  attention  and  acclaim.
       Really  they  are operating from a point of view that has much in
       common with the "hacker's," which is the mindset  of  "I'm  gonna
       get  mine."  So this journalist looks around at the headlines and
       realizes that there is a mounting wave  of  hysteria  surrounding
       viruses  and  hackers  and  invasion  of  privacy  and . . . gee,
       wouldn't it be a nice career move to do a  story  that  will  mix
       their  name  into whatever the hot topic of the next five minutes
       happens to be.

       If the journalist is attached to any  even  marginally  important
-- more --                        publication,  they  will  then  get  their  pick  from one of the
       current four or five "names" doing  the  rounds.   On  the  other
       hand,  if  the  journalist  is just starting out and connected to
       something much smaller, then the chances  are  they  will  simply
       show up at some user's group meeting, find the nearest thing they
       can to a "computer nerd," do an interview, and then write  it  up
       expressing  whatever  the  current  publicly-sanctioned viewpoint
       happens to be (the usual slant has become: hackers are  evil  and
       can look at your credit rating, fear them).

       I have been interviewed on many  occasions  and  I  know  roughly
       twenty  people  who  have  done  the interviews that comprise the
       basis of about 90% of all media that exists in  relation  to  the
       underground;  be it in newspaper, periodical, television segment,
       or book format.  WITH *VERY*  FEW  EXCEPTIONS,  there  have  been
       countless  solicitations  to perform illegal acts in the presence
       of journalists, these solicitations move all the way  into  coer-
       cion  in some cases.  There are reports containing sentences that
       were never spoken, quotes taken out of context, information  that
       was  invented  .  .  . there's simply no end to it.  The reporter
       profits first by stroking the hacker's ego  and  giving  him  the
       spotlight that he thinks he wants so badly, and then continues to
-- more --                        profit as the hacker rides a bigger and bigger wave of  publicity
       that  in  every case leads to a very unhappy ending if the hacker
       in question doesn't have the foresight to get off the ride before
       it derails.

       In any case, whatever happens, the reporter  always  wins.   When
       the  hacker's  ride reaches its date with fate, the journalist in
       question can now write the closing chapter in the  hacker's  saga
       and  tell  the  public how this nefarious evil-doer is being pun-
       ished by the long arm of justice.  This is  followed  up  by  the
       journalist  taking  on  the "official" mantle of "hacker expert,"
       doing the lecture circuit, perhaps writing a book, and then going
       out and finding a new horse to beat to death.

       Obviously nothing can ever be this black and white, there must be
       a need for both parties to play their roles.  The reporter is not
       THE EVIL BAD MAN who has corrupted the INNOCENT  ANGELIC  HACKER,
       nor  does this scenario apply to all journalists equally, off the
       top of my head; Bruce Sterling, John Markoff, and Julian  Dibbell
       come to mind as extremely ethical exceptions to the norm.

       Usually the reporter who isn't quite so ethical is just  somebody
-- more --                        who  is presented with a situation that can easily be twisted and
       misused if the desire for fame and fortune takes precedence  over
       everything  else.   The  reporter  by  the very nature of his job
       tends to be quite "slick" and worldly-wise, whereas the hacker in
       question  is  usually highly knowledgeable about computer systems
       while managing to retain an oblivious naivety about the  workings
       of  human  beings  in that elusive place called "the real world."
       This sets the stage for what transpires.

       And you see a lot of people who used  to  be  your  friends,  get
       ground  up  in  this  endless cycle as it repeats itself over and
       over again until one day you wake up and  come  to  realize  that
       you're  seventeen  or  eighteen going on 90.  You understand that
       everything in the whole world is comprised of bits and pieces  of
       lies  and  half-truths, everyone is inherently corrupt, including
       you; a lot of kids who used to be your friends are now all  grown
       up  with  no  place  to  go and getting busted for such things as
       fraud and grand larceny; and you have  utterly  lost  touch  with
       anything  even remotely "real."  And yet, you're still a teenager
       and have another 70 or 80 years  left  to  hang  around  on  this
       planet.

-- more --                        This is right around the time that you're back in the media, only
       this  trip  around you're at the receiving end of law enforcement
       who have been prodded into a state of near-hysteria by the  dawn-
       ing  realization  that  a  bunch of kids really can dismantle the
       building  blocks  of  the  infrastructure  that  makes  most   of
       present-day  society  possible.  Naturally enough they're scared,
       and they're in the process of doing what  people  have  done  for
       ages when they are afraid: going on a witch-hunt.  Guess who gets
       to play witch...

       So one day you find yourself wondering why you should bother buy-
       ing  another  computer  system  and trying to figure out what the
       point of it all was anyway; to glimpse  the  limitless  potential
       and  then  fall  back  and  only  see your own flaws amplified to
       cartoon-like proportions.

       The 1980's were a time that saw the birth and death of the  first
       dynasties  of  Cyberspace.   Travelling  through  the  electronic
       landscape of this period in time, was like traversing  this  sur-
       real  range  of mountains, where amongst the sheer outcropping of
       rock, lush valleys, and snow-capped peaks, a collection of rather
       obsessive  dreamers  had built some of the most beautiful castles
-- more --                        that were ever created and opened their doors to  a  populace  of
       pioneers.   It was absolutely transporting and timeless . . . and
       unfortunately -- in the short term -- doomed.

       This has been an abbreviated summary of the atmosphere and events
       that  started  a  kind  of mass exodus out of the modem world for
       about twenty of us.  We had spent our  entire  childhoods  jacked
       into  this alternate electronic universe, locked into playing our
       overly-developed personas, and almost no time figuring out who we
       were  and  what  we  wanted  out of life beyond "further, better,
       more."  This is nothing new or unique in and of  itself,  it  was
       however  something  that gained a very tangible and immediate im-
       portance to many of us when we found  that  the  thoughtspace  in
       which we had lived a large portion of our lives had disintegrated
       and the people we had  known  and  called  friends,  had  largely
       disappeared and been replaced by every negative quality they pos-
       sessed.

       A lot of us dumped the remnants of this reality into a  stack  of
       boxes  and  took off for parts unknown.  Whether college, work, a
       new circle of friends that didn't know who  you  were  in  Cyber-
       space, or even know what Cyberspace was; just about anywhere were
-- more --                        we could start over and try to regain what had somehow been lost.

                     "Ya live your life like it's a coma,
                      so won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
                         With all the reasons you give,
                          it's kinda hard to believe;

                        any reason why you should stay;
                Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway..."
                                             --Guns N Roses(*2)

       After coming to the realization that visiting The Tunnel for  the
       fourteenth  time  in  three weeks was not going to change my life
       for the better, and having no idea what I wanted to do  with  my-
       self,  I  dropped it all and got on a plane for the middle of no-
       where New Mexico.  Where I proceeded  to  cycle  through  all  my
       negative  tendencies  at  an  accelerated  pace,   first becoming
       utterly obsessed with bodybuilding, to the point of five  hour  a
-- more --                        day  workouts,  insane  diets,  steroids,  and a silly-putty like
       transformation of myself to 6'2" 215 pounds and 6% bodyfat.

       This was good for about ten months, before I found myself in  the
       same mindset I had thought I could escape.  Looking in the mirror
       and seeing a parody of who I used to be, wondering  where  to  go
       from  there.  The answer was obviously to buy a Porsche and begin
       re-stocking my wardrobe with everything by  Armani  and  Versace,
       yes  I  had it now, this WAS the right answer, I only had to look
       around at all the people I knew doing just this to see that . . .
       well,  actually  they  were  all  pretty miserable, but again, it
       lasted for about nine or ten months.

       Around this time I realized that aside from the fact that I was a
       pretty  fucked  up person who probably needed a lot of therapy --
       which had never quite worked out the right  way  when  I  had  it
       thrust  upon  me  as a teenager -- I had become completely out of
       touch with my feelings.  Not out of  touch  that  I  didn't  have
       them,  I  had  over a thousand pages of them sprayed across mega-
       bytes of disks where I wrote out all the things inside of  myself
       driving  me crazy;  but out of touch in the sense that when I be-
       gan taking things apart and  analyzing  reality,  I  had  stopped
-- more --                        listening  to  anything  I  felt inside and just tuned in to what
       seemed logical.

       The problem being that the more you try to act out of logic,  the
       more you find yourself applying logic to utterly emotional issues
       in an completely crazed and  self-destructive  way.   When  logic
       should  be  asking: "Why do I want to weigh 215 pounds of muscle?
       What the hell am I doing?" it suddenly finds itself in the  posi-
       tion  of  contemplating "Ok, so if I want to gain 5 pounds in the
       next 2 weeks, how many CC's of Deca do I mix with X mg.  of  Ana-
       var,  with what ratio of carbs/fat and what is the minimum PER of
       the protein I am going to consume in order to remain in an  anti-
       catabolic state?"

       Welcome to real-life Alice in Wonderland, taking  place  in  your
       head.

       At the age of twenty-one I had managed to attain a place where  I
       possessed everything that I ever thought I wanted.  Life is funny
       that way, you really do get whatever you desire.   Endless  hours
       spent  reading  thousands  of books; the mix and match regimen of
       combinations of new nootropics and longevity agents; and the  fi-
-- more --                        nal  combination  of steroids and obsessive workouts had resulted
       in my achievement of the goal I had subconsciously  been  working
       towards  for  most  of my life.  I had succeeded in my efforts to
       become absolutely untouchable by anyone or anything.

       When you are no longer in the middle of a situation and have  the
       comfort of hindsight it's very simple to deduce what the underly-
       ing problems behind anything happen to be, and why you are acting
       in a way that is physically, mentally and spiritually destructive
       to yourself.  While there is nothing inherently  wrong  with  any
       action  I  might have taken, it all comes back to the question of
       why are you doing something?  And looking back upon  my  life,  I
       had actually lived very little of it in an attempt to make myself
       happy.  Almost everything had been some sort of reaction to those
       around me, and how I felt I had to respond to them.

       Despite my intellectual understanding of  how  brief  moments  of
       stimulus-response  can  shape  a person's existence, like so many
       endlessly-referenced frames  of  film  forever  etched  in  their
       brain.   Long-gone  fragments  of  time that refuse to relinquish
       their hold on the present, telling people who they  are,  setting
       their limitations, and defining the boundaries of what they allow
-- more --                        their lives to mean.  In truth I had never managed to  apply  any
       of  this knowledge to myself and had lived most of my life in ac-
       cordance with the patterns of self-destructive  programming  per-
       petually repeating a loop in my head.

       From childhood onwards I have been through  a  seemingly  endless
       variety of extremes in my life; moving from levels of comfortable
       opulence, to near-poverty and back again, more times than I  care
       to  count.   What  I  had  learned  from this was that being poor
       wasn't that much fun, and could really suck, therefore logic dic-
       tates  that  I must always have a lot of money and do whatever it
       takes to get it.  In fact I'm going to be so unconcerned with mo-
       ney  that  I will start to feel anxious if I'm not wearing a $300
       dollar haircut and a $400 dollar shirt.  I have  felt  controlled
       by  situations  beyond my reach in the past, therefore I am going
       to learn as much as I can about everything, so that  nobody  will
       ever  be  able  to  fuck  with  my head and attempt to control me
       through misrepresentation of the  truth.   I  have  been  out-of-
       control  with  various  addictions and done such stupid things to
       myself that through combinations of downers and alcohol I have at
       one  point  weighed  over 300 pounds; therefore I will understand
       every fucking piece of biochemistry that is known about the human
-- more --                        body,  I  will  do  whatever it takes to look into the mirror and
       gain my own approval even if it means working out with such  fre-
       quency that a pleasant sport becomes a daily torture session that
       leaves me nauseous and physically incapable of performing  simple
       movements  because  everything  hurts  all the time.  I will look
       like someone has spray-painted skin onto a statue no  matter  how
       difficult  it  is to maintain this state constantly, I will force
       myself to eat 6,000 calories of protein and 400 calories of  car-
       bohydrate,  and  if I can no longer think or move and my ultimate
       fantasy has become sleeping 18 hours a day, then that's what caf-
       feine and amphetamines are for.  I live in hell therefore I shall
       use drugs to escape my hell by taking week-long vacations on opi-
       ates,  but  I will never be controlled by anything, so on the 8th
       day I will walk away from heaven and live  through  a  couple  of
       days  of  pain  that  hurt  a little bit more than the rest of my
       life, but I will never be some fucking junkie, because I not only
       can  do  anything,  I  WILL  do  it,  and I just dare the fucking
       universe to try and prove otherwise, because I can quit anything,
       I  can  conquer  anything, I can do anything to prove anything to
       anyone and you can't stop me, because the entire world is full of
       weak,  soft and stupid motherfuckers who talk much and do little;
       praise George Bernard Shaw and pass the Nietzsche.
-- more --                        Coming down off the adrenalin and testosterone rush the  memories
       I  used  to write that paragraph with have triggered, I'd like to
       take this moment to borrow a  quote  from  one  of  the  greatest
       poet-philosophers of our time: "Happy happy! Joy joy!"

       After endless repetitions of this cycle I had finally  reached  a
       state  in  which  my  internal  programming ceased to function --
       there was simply nothing left I could  apply  it  to.   Over  the
       years  I  had  overcome most of my psychological barriers through
       direct mental or physical actions, that  had  brought  with  them
       physical  rewards  that I was utterly incapable of applying to my
       life at that time.  Welcome to oblivion.

       Hitting absolute nothingness was the beginning of a very personal
       catharsis  for me that finally led to turning inwards to see what
       was wrong, since externally, everything looked okay.  I  had  at-
       tained  a  physical state that "corrected" everything my subcons-
       cious had said was "wrong" with me, yet for some bewildering rea-
       son  I  was  not  deliriously  happy.  A series of steps followed
       which eventually led to various experiments in the world of thea-
       tre and film, where I had the chance to re-connect with emotions,
-- more --                        and get them back into some kind of perspective from the comfort-
       able vantage point and attitude of: "they're not really mine, I'm
       only playing them."  All of which reached a pinnacle when I began
       experimenting with LSD for the first time.

       If you have never experienced what it is like to be  on  an  acid
       trip,  it  will  be  difficult for me to convey the kaleidoscopic
       depth of experience you are presented with.  It does nothing less
       nor more, than strip away every preconceived notion that you have
       ever had regarding what "reality" is.   Beyond  the  special  ef-
       fects,  intellectual  realizations,  and  creative opportunity it
       presents, it leaves you imbued with one very basic truth  of  the
       universe:   No  matter  what  the actual outcome of your actions,
       what matters is your intent.  If what you are doing  --  whatever
       it  may be -- is being done out of any reason other than a desire
       to bring happiness to people; to help humanity as a  whole  reach
       some greater level of understanding; to uplift and inspire people
       to reach for something that is within everyone's grasp . . . then
       you are wasting your time.

       This is not exactly news, I mean it is the  basic  belief  system
       that every religion on earth is founded on (with the possible ex-
-- more --                        ception of Satanism, and a few other offshoots of this system  of
       thought).   The problem with religion getting such a bad rap most
       of the time is largely due to the fact that most people  who  act
       as  spokesmen  for  any  given religious cause, are only mouthing
       words they comprehend on an intellectual level.  They are not ac-
       tually  living  in this state of internal alignment, so what they
       have to offer can be very suspect . . . how is  someone  who  has
       not  attained  what  he speaks of, supposed to help you attain it
       for yourself?  While dogma may help a limited few, it will  never
       reach  most  of  those  who posses the ability to think for them-
       selves.  Nor is standing at a pulpit or in front of a camera  and
       ranting  about  damnation, going to help anyone reach any kind of
       positive state.

       I obviously cannot speak for everybody, but from my own  perspec-
       tive  I had read the holy books of most religions on earth when I
       became interested in psychology and the theories of Carl Jung  --
       who  crosses  over into mysticism and religious experience, going
       as far as the concept of "karma" with his theory of  Synchronici-
       ty.  Yet I never got anything from them other than an intellectu-
       al high of understanding how groups of people could be programmed
       to behave in certain ways . . . which isn't what it's about.  The
-- more --                        EXPERIENCE is what all religions are based on, how you choose  to
       interpret it is entirely up to you.  But a very simple thing that
       becomes apparent is the basic truth that wherever  your  inspira-
       tion  is  coming  from, if it fills you with the need to motivate
       large groups of people to do SOMETHING, be that something in  the
       name  of  "God" or anybody else . . . then somewhere, you got the
       wrong message.  Because there really isn't all that much  to  say
       beyond  the  very simple and obvious, "give love and you will get
       it."  The only thing that needs to be changed  is  your  attitude
       and outlook on life.  Making group_of_people(x) move twenty paces
       to the left while wearing black hats and reading  from  the  Holy
       Book  of  the  Arboreal  Tree Sloth, isn't gonna make the world a
       better place.

       While this discourse is tangential to some of the issues at hand,
       in  a  great  sense  it  is the underlying cause for all of them.
       Once you have seen the light as it were, or understood the bigger
       picture . . . it becomes very hard to go back to living life with
       blinders on regarding your  own  actions.   Until  it  eventually
       reaches  the  place where I found myself.  The point at which the
       only things I'm going to talk about are those that matter to  me,
       things  I  believe  in . . . things I believe will help people in
-- more --                        some manner.  Along with the realization that I cannot do  a  lot
       of  things  I  used  to  do  anymore.  I cannot lie to people and
       present them with some image they want to see  in  order  to  get
       something  from  them  --  because I mean, WHAT is there to "get"
       anyway?  I can no longer be a politician or figurehead for causes
       that I do not believe in, and I will no longer waste my time tak-
       ing part in meaningless drivel that serves to do nothing but  en-
       trench me in bullshit without end; I had already spent most of my
       life taking apart the rules and winning at whatever game I  tried
       to  play.   What  I never bothered to examine was the fact that I
       didn't "win" anything that ever brought me any happiness  .  .  .
       what is the point in playing if you don't want the "prize?"


       Stagnation of the Electronic Frontier
       -------------------------------------

       Moving forward in time by about two years, this was the  attitude
       that  I  had managed to retain as I returned to New York.  Every-
       thing was the same, yet completely different.  What had been per-
       vaded  by  Nihilism  and vacuity only a short time ago, was now a
       pathway of infinite potential and limitless possibility.  For the
-- more --                        first  time  in  almost  six years I actually felt completely in-
       spired and excited by the possibilities that life in general  and
       Cyberspace in particular had to offer.

       The summer of 1991 was a kind of "class reunion" for many of  us.
       For  the  first  time  in almost half a decade we found ourselves
       back in New York City, the place where all of  this  had  started
       for us such a long time ago.

       What happened was pretty much the expected; an endless stream  of
       jokes  and  self-depreciating  humor regarding who we used to be,
       the three-letter acronyms we used to affiliate with  or  have  in
       revolution around us, the state of the universe and everything in
       it, and a general time of catching up on who had done  what.   It
       was  a strange situation, since we really had disappeared, to the
       extent that most of us had not talked with one another in  years,
       it  was almost as if picking up the phone and speaking with some-
       one from back then would bring back all the bad things  you  were
       trying to get rid of.

       Out of this gathering, I found about a  dozen  people  who  I  no
       longer  knew.   People who had become submerged in drugs, and be-
-- more --                        come lost in different sub-cultures where  they  could  live  out
       reasonable facsimiles of their childhoods forevermore; people who
       had completely lost touch with what they used to be,  and  become
       stereotypical  examples  of  what  people  tend to term "computer
       geeks," the sum total of their interest in life having been  nar-
       rowed  down  to that new bug in X windows client-server architec-
       ture and what it would mean to the future of the OSF; people  who
       hadn't  changed  at all and were still busy "getting over" on so-
       ciety   in   general;  but   perhaps  most  surprising,  I  found
       that about ten people I used to know had gone  through  a  growth
       process very similar to my own, and actually succeeded in solving
       their quest and winning the prize we had all sought so badly.

       The correct solution to the "quest," is of course, that there  is
       no  solution.   There  is nothing you are looking for, except for
       you, and once you realize this, you win the big prize,  you  find
       yourself, and get to live happily ever after.

       After re-discovering that a group of us seemed to thoroughly  en-
       joy  each other's company, we eventually ended up having a weekly
       meeting where we'd  get  together  and  discuss  various  topics.
       Foremost  amongst them was one that sprung up with increasing re-
-- more --                        gularity as the weeks went by:  getting back  onto  the  frontier
       from  a  completely different angle.  As years went by many of us
       had started completely different lives;  some  were  in  college,
       others  had  started companies or gone to work for companies they
       had once laughed at, and still more had started careers complete-
       ly unrelated to anything they had been doing in the past.  But it
       had became clear that what we really wanted to do  was  take  the
       incredible  promise  that  had  been shown to us during our youth
       when we had walked along the edge of a new reality unfolding, and
       channel  it  into  a positive direction that would benefit every-
       body.

       As we found out, the hacker underground had  continued  with  its
       headlong  dive  into  oblivion.   The  underground  had basically
       ceased to exist after the Operation Sun Devil sweep.  Just  about
       the  only "hacker systems" still in existence were those catering
       to the teenagers whose priorities focused on  ripping  off  phone
       companies, collecting VMB codes and pirating software.

       While this was slightly depressing, it was also a  foregone  con-
       clusion  and  didn't  cause too much surprise.  The main focus of
       our interest was what had become of the mainstream telecommunica-
-- more --                        tions nets -- given half a decade to evolve, something really ex-
       citing must have happened by now.  The hardware that we ended  up
       sitting  in  front  of,  would have made possible an undreamed of
       variety of possibility when taken  into  context  with  what  was
       available in the past.  We were used to 64K Apple ][+ systems, or
       maybe tricked out //e's with 128K and PC's with 640K, and now  we
       were  sitting  at  a friend's house in front of a NeXT and an SGI
       Indigo.  When you thought about the fact that 7 years ago you had
       paid about $8,500 for a 4.5megabyte Corvus hard disk, and now you
       could buy an entire NeXT with that . . . it was, fantastic.

       Before taking off on our expedition of present-day Cyberspace, we
       had  spoken  with  some of our friends who were familiar with the
       terrain, and received somewhat  tepid  responses  and  a  general
       dismissal  of what was going on right now.  Thinking the attitude
       was one of standard arrogance which we had all gone  through,  we
       didn't  pay  too  much attention to it and set out to explore the
       new electronic nervous system of the world.

       A couple of hours later it became shockingly apparent  that  most
       of  the potential of the bright new technology that now existed .
       . . that could have been used to create and house an infinite ex-
-- more --                        panse  of  innovation, communication, and pooling of thought, lay
       dormant.  Thus far it had seemingly been  utilized  to  construct
       gigantic file servers that advertised their existence by digitiz-
       ing porno magazines and  editing  their  dialup  lines  into  the
       resulting scan.

       All those wonderful places that we had travelled in the past, and
       had  dominated  the landscape only half a decade before . . . had
       indeed been razed, paved over, and replaced by an  endless  elec-
       tronic  expanse  of  snap-together tract houses that littered the
       landscape with numbingly identical  systems.   The  frontier  had
       packed  up  and moved back into labs where people like our friend
       with the workstations were working on applications that  wouldn't
       see  the light of day for another decade.  And what was out there
       right now, was strikingly similar to a generic suburb of AnyTown,
       USA.

       Objectively a suburb is not a bad thing, it's planned out,  logi-
       cal, it works, it doesn't need to be any different from any other
       suburb . . . in short, it's functional.  It's also very different
       from  the  environment we had grown up in, where everything was a
       new step further out into the unknown, where anything could  hap-
-- more --                        pen, and nobody had ever been there before.

       From our vantage point it looked as if the explorers  had  indeed
       gone  back to their ivory towers (or haunted dungeons as the case
       may be), and a lot of used car salesmen had set up shop  cranking
       out the snap-together tract houses, when they realized they could
       make more money doing that, than say, selling used cars.

       It was truly a mind blowing experience to witness for  the  first
       time,  systems that actually advertised themselves based upon how
       many lines they had, or how much storage.  Attitudes  that  would
       have  garnered  a great deal of scorn and derision -- and in gen-
       eral made your advertisement the brunt of a lot of jokes --  were
       suddenly the accepted way in which systems chose to differentiate
       themselves from one another.  Looking at them, it  came  down  to
       the  fact  that the only difference between system (A) and system
       (B) was that one might have 16 lines while the other had 24,  and
       system (C) was inherently superior to both (a) and (b) because it
       had 32 lines and 4 gigabytes of storage  (used  to  house  10,000
       programs,  out of which the same 200 are downloaded over and over
       again, as the rest of the junk sits there gathering dust).

-- more --                        Even more frightening, on a system that had  10,000  messages  on
       it,  an  average  of  9,800  will be echoes of FidoNet or RIME or
       whatever-net, leaving a grand total of about  200  messages  from
       the  actual members.  And frequently those 200 messages date back
       a year and a half . . . a couple of years ago a BAD one line sys-
       tem  had that many messages in a week.  A good one in a couple of
       hours.

       To a lot of people Cyberspace has become one big file server .  .
       .  strikingly  similar  to what television has devolved into.  An
       entirely passive place where you press  buttons  and  get  enter-
       tained, no thought required, no input necessary.

       Realizing that we were merely skimming the surface, and might not
       know  the  whole story, we spent a couple of weeks becoming fami-
       liar with what had happened, and what the situation  really  was.
       Based  upon several hundred conversations with various people who
       were involved with the current scene, we arrived at a  couple  of
       very basic conclusions.

       In order to run a system in the  present  environment,  and  have
       users,  you  needed to have a pile of hardware, many phone lines,
-- more --                        some sort of marketing and bookkeeping ability, a  lot  of  spare
       time, coupled with infinite patience to put up with people, since
       they are now your customers, not just your friends, and  if  they
       call  you  up asking the same goofy questions you cannot take the
       phone off the hook or tell them to go away.

       Where running a system in the  past  had  meant  giving  up  your
       second phone line, it presently involved a great deal of interac-
       tion with the department of Red Tape, and  Bureau  of  Tasks  You
       Really  Aren't Interested In.  This opened the door to the "used-
       car salesmen" people, since these were things they were  used  to
       doing  every day.  Conversely, it has almost universally been our
       experience that the guy who is a Unix wizard and can  work  magic
       with networking and programming, lives in deathly fear of signing
       paperwork, filling out his tax returns, or figuring out where  he
       parked  his car.  And finally, the creative person whose main in-
       terest is making fantastic places, lacks the time and patience to
       write  the  code, and certainly has no interest in administrative
       duties.

       In effect, most people with the desire to  do  something  better,
       did  not  have  the  necessary $25-30k laying around, and even if
-- more --                        they did, they would never act on it because they'd be forced  to
       spend  a great deal of their time doing a hundred things they had
       no interest in doing.  So the online world had begun to  be  dom-
       inated by the file servers, who didn't really have much of an in-
       terest in being anything other than file servers, since that made
       the  most  money  with the least effort, and anybody with $25,000
       could toss up a snap-together MeSsyDOS  based  system  with  very
       little technical ability required.

       Thus began the era of the "tract-houses"  where  advertising  and
       atmosphere  consisted  of  rattling  off  hardware statistics and
       number of phone lines, along with the number  of  shareware  pro-
       grams  available  for  downloading (an extremely amusing concept,
       considering that there are literally TERABYTES of  free  software
       available  for  the  taking  on  ftp sites all over the Internet,
       which cost NOTHING to download from).

       With the exception of two of three bright  lights  that  had  the
       right idea and were trying to do something different, most of the
       electronic frontier had indeed vanished.  And it isn't so hard to
       see  where  a couple of years from now the same advertising agen-
       cies that sell brain-dead ads designed to induce you to crave one
-- more --                        brand  of beer over another, will be pushing SYSTEM X, because IT
       HAS 10,000 phone lines!  Call now and  leave  your  mind  at  the
       door!


       Transcendence 
       -------------

       It has generally been our experience that people are neither stu-
       pid,  nor shallow.  Everyone has the potential to think for them-
       selves, to overcome adverse situations, and contribute  something
       to this world.  When placed in situations that offer these possi-
       bilities, people tend to come through with surprising regularity.
       In  a fairly short amount of time you end up with a group of peo-
       ple doing something they themselves would have deemed improbable,
       if  not  downright impossible, if you had asked them at any other
       point in their lives.

       Virtual Reality has the potential to become the single  most  im-
       portant  development  in the history of human evolution.  It is a
       technology that holds the promise  of  absolute  liberation.   It
       also  holds  the possibility of turning the world into the rather
-- more --                        grim one that is the basis of  much  Cyberpunk  fiction,  a  dark
       place where technology is used to oppress and suppress people.

       By its very nature, it is very  difficult  to  ever  imagine  the
       latter.   In  order  to  have a police state, you need to amass a
       certain amount of power, yet Cyberspace is the ultimate  equaliz-
       er.   It  is  a place where one person can wield as much power as
       100, 1,000, or 100,000 people.   Physical  limitations  are  cast
       off,  and in the event of conflict the playing field becomes that
       of mind vs. mind.  Sheer numbers and a mob rules mentality  cease
       to have any meaning when you can create infinite numbers of elec-
       tronic organisms to do anything you want them to do.

       The hope is that it will never sink to such a level of stupidity.
       Games  are  wonderful,  but  there  is  no need for conflict, all
       struggle tends to be internal conflict that has become  external-
       ized.   When  you  want  to convert the sinners, or prove you are
       right, all you're doing is having an argument with yourself.  The
       beautiful  thing  about  Virtual Reality is the fact that you are
       free to do that, for as long as you need, to work out  that  par-
       ticular set of problems -- without harming anybody.

-- more --                        There is only one ultimate truth, which is BEING  HAPPY  and  ex-
       periencing LOVE.  How you choose to perceive it is a very indivi-
       dual matter.  While it might mean blue to you, orange to that guy
       over  there,  and  silver to me, it's all the same thing.  In the
       real world if we held fast to those beliefs and behaved as people
       have  been classically shown to behave, then we'd be killing each
       other over who has the right idea about love . . . Cyberspace al-
       lows  everyone  the  freedom  to  co-exist without harming anyone
       else's world-view or belief system.  And if you truly  are  given
       the opportunity to live in an environment conducive to you happi-
       ness, then if that heretic who thinks orange is the  answer  were
       ever to show up at your front door, chances are you would be able
       to tolerate him, and even, "God" forbid,  express  the  love  you
       claim to espouse.


       Phantom Access - The Ethereal Takes Shape
       -----------------------------------------

       There was never any solid dividing line where we decided that  we
       really  wanted  to  put together a system where we could have the
       freedom of expression we wanted, with the  ultimate  goal  really
-- more --                        being  the  very  simple  one of pushing the envelope further and
       further out there.  All of us had obligations, school,  and  per-
       sonal  commitments that would be difficult to integrate into this
       major change of plans.  But inevitably the  mass  exodus  out  of
       college,  the  avoidance of unnecessary responsibilities, and the
       initial stages of planning were set in motion.

       Six months later we had close  to  a  hundred  thousand  dollars,
       top-down  system  design,  a fully designed multi-user simulation
       engine, a general idea of what we would do and how  we  would  go
       about it, a team of our friends together one more time, only this
       time as a real corporation, and over one  thousand  megabytes  of
       the  collected history of Cyberspace, dating back to systems that
       existed in 1979, that had been laying in dusty boxes filled  with
       old Apple DOS 3.3 disks.

       On April 1st 1992 MindVox  went  into  its  alpha-testing  stage.
       Which  loosely speaking means that we put everything together and
       watched it disintegrate repeatedly as the last 300-400 bugs  were
       worked out of the system.  Since then it has been running in pro-
       tected environment mode with a collection of our friends and  as-
       sociates crash-testing the software, suggesting where rough-edges
-- more --                        might be smoothed, and generally having a good time creating some
       of  the  atmosphere while trying to destroy the software in every
       conceivable way so that everything is solid upon inception.

       In May of 1992 MindVox will open it's doors to  the  public.   As
       much  as  we'd  like  to say that it's going to completely change
       everything, it will not.  All it can do is allow people who  feel
       in  rhythm  with this vision of the world to converge together in
       one of the most interesting nexus points of Cyberspace.   To  ex-
       tend  their reach, explore new levels of experience, and interact
       with some of the pioneers in the fields of computer science, net-
       working,  science-fiction,  music,  the arts, politics, religion,
       altered states, and future reality.

       Our main priority is to create and  continuously  evolve  an  en-
       vironment  that fosters an atmosphere of dynamic creativity, cou-
       pled with access to information and ideas, that present you  with
       a far greater spectrum of possibility than you might otherwise be
       able to access.

       ------

       Nothing of this magnitude could ever take shape  based  upon  the
       merits  of  any  one individual.  The entire Phantom Access Group
       has been a collaborative effort since it  began  some  ten  years
       ago;  the  MindVox  project is merely the first confluence of the
       diverse talents that comprise the core of Phantom Access  Techno-
       logies,  that has been directed towards the electronic and socie-
       tal mainstream.

       Looking back over the years, there are very few of my friends who
       have not in some way contributed to the genesis of Phantom Access
       and the creation of MindVox, and I'd like to take this opportuni-
       ty to express my gratitude to all of them.

       People I would like to specifically thank, and without whom Mind-
       Vox  could  not  have  been launched in the manner we wanted, in-
       clude:

            First and foremost, my fiance Delia, who has  made  much  of
       the last several years possible; who never knew about "Lord Digi-
-- more --                        tal" when she met me; who has  gone  from  "computers,  uh,  ugh,
       that's  so  . . . um, dull" to not only seeing the potentials in-
       herent in the capabilities the technology  presents  to  all  so-
       ciety,  but actually extending many hundreds of hours of her time
       to scripting sections of the project and designing human interac-
       tion  POV's  based  upon her lifelong experience with theatre and
       film.  She has also shown remarkable grace by retaining  a  sense
       of  humor  when  dealing  with  2am anonymous calls from computer
       dudes who feel compelled to ask "so, what does Lord Digital do in
       bed?" questions.

            The second person to whom I owe a great deal is Bruce Fanch-
       er,  my  partner in this endeavor, as well as half a hundred pro-
       jects that have spanned over a decade.  Without you  many  things
       would not have been possible, and those that were would have been
       a lot less fun.  It has been an interesting  experience  watching
       someone  grow  into  an  adult who has retained all the qualities
       that made them so much fun to hang out with  in  our  youth,  yet
       managed  to temper that childlike glee with responsibility, humor
       in the face of adversity, and that elusive quality called charac-
       ter.  Here's to another couple of decades of Lord & Lord.

-- more --                             I would like to thank every member  of  the  Phantom  Access
       Group  for  the  thousands of hours spent designing, implementing
       and de-bugging the programs  that  make  MindVox  come  to  life.
       Respective   of  some  people's  desire  to  remain  out  of  the
       spotlight, I will leave it at that.  You know who you are &  any-
       one  who really cares to find that out can do so at any time they
       desire.

            Phiber Optik:  For applying his considerable skills in a po-
       sitive  direction  and  helping  us make MindVox a very difficult
       fortress to lay siege to, while at the same time adding a tremen-
       dous  amount  of versatility to our networking and communications
       interface options.  Most of all, thank you for having the courage
       to  realize  that the world is not always a logical or fair place
       and that no matter how intelligent you are or how noble your  in-
       tentions,  you  can  be dragged down by the stupidity and fear of
       those around you if you associate with people who  do  not  share
       the same qualities you possess.

            Charles:  For a great deal of assistance in updating many of
       us regarding the current status of new technology and what's just
       over the horizon, as well as providing tremendous aid by  showing
-- more --                        us  functional  examples  of  the state of the art in distributed
       electronic networking, and taking us  on  a  fast-forward  cruise
       through  a  wide  variety  of  hardware platforms and development
       tools.  Your friendship, advice, and persistent belief in our vi-
       sion, has been invaluable.

            Len Rose:  For being a good friend over the years and always
       giving  assistance  with  anything  we  have needed.  Most of all
       thanks for coming out of everything you've been through with  op-
       timism about the future and an intact belief system.  Peace.

            George Gleason:  For being a person who has become one of my
       close friends faster than anyone else ever did.  For possessing a
       really beautiful outlook on life & everything in it, and for  al-
       ways  being  a calming voice when things are completely crazy and
       the moon is full.

            Bruce Sterling:  For his encouragement, support, and a real-
       ly  funny  talk  at CFP-2.  Most of all, the deepest appreciation
       for doing an admirable job of presenting the unbiased truth while
       chronicling some of the events that have taken place on the fron-
       tiers of Cyberspace.
-- more --                             Mike Godwin:  For putting up  with  many  long  and  strange
       phone calls regarding a wide variety of topics; for helping us to
       avoid potential pitfalls and difficulty; for providing encourage-
       ment  and  advice, and in general, for being a really cool person
       who has gone out of his way many times to provide us with  assis-
       tance.

            Thomas Dell:  For writing code full  of  obscure  jokes  and
       weird  ramblings that do wonders to wake you up and get your full
       attention when you are changing things at 3am, and for  being  an
       exceptionally  gracious  guy who is one of the limited handful of
       people that have maintained their sense of vision in the face  of
       impending mediocrity and industrialization.

            Special thanks to Dan, SN, SR, D00f and everyone in DPAK and
       cDc,  who  comprise some of the very few who managed to grasp the
       obvious, and in turn make use of this knowledge in an  entertain-
       ing and lucid manner.  Additional accolades to DPAK for being the
       only eL!te duDeZ to use a four letter acronym instead of a  three
       letter one.  The vision, the sheer wow!

-- more --                             Mega-Supra-Surfin-the-Ozone Thanks to  Mondo  2000.   Beyond
       the  sea  of  screaming  fluff  and  designer hyperbole contained
       within the covers of any issue of Mondo, there is  also  a  great
       deal of truth to be found about Cyberspace, music, art, film, and
       life in general.  Mondo has thus far shown itself  to  be  beyond
       reproach  as  far  as journalistic ethics and presentation of the
       facts are concerned.  It is also to be commended as a publication
       with  a  sound  belief in typing words at random and letting them
       fall where they may.

            Finally, tremendous gratitude goes to Jim Thomas.  A  person
       I  do  not  know  and have never spoken with, yet someone who has
       done an exceptionally important  service  to  all  of  Cyberspace
       with  the  forum  presented  by Computer Underground Digest.  Ir-
       respective even of CuD, I  have  heard  nothing  but  praise  and
       well-wishing from the many you have helped.  Thank you.




            Additional thanks to:  Paul, Yuri, Eric & Eric, Ken & every-
       one who has made the move to Phibro Energy, Drowned Fish, Andrew,

                           MindVox [CREDITS] Creation

  The MindVox project has been made possible by a wide confluence  of  talents
  all  focused  on  the single goal of creating one of the most unique and in-
  teresting nexus points within Cyberspace.

  The continual evolution of the environment made possible by MindVox  is  the
  foremost  goal  of  the  Phantom  Access  Group,  and all design work, past,
  present and future, is geared towards the realization of this objective.

  The software that makes all of this possible  is  in  a  constant  state  of
  change  as  enhancements are made and problems eradicated.  If there is any-
  thing you would like to see that does not exist at present, or you find  any
  feature  confusing  or  difficult to use, then please let us know so that we
  can continue to make improvements.

  More than anything MindVox is an ongoing  experiment  in  human  potentials,
  that strives to push the limits of online possibility and  remain a force on
  the cutting edge of innovation in the electronic  universe that is beginning
  to awaken and expand as a new level of reality unfolds...
-- more --                   
  ...it is also  really neato, and 9  out of 10 people  agree that  it's a lot
  better than watching TV.  Although it has not yet replaced sex, we feel safe
  in our assertion  that MindVox is NEWER, FLASHIER  and MORE SATISFYING  than
  Gummy Bears, and longer lasting than most hair styling products.

           MindVox is running VOICE 2.0(x)  (Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP)
           
                      Designed by The Phantom Access Group

  Software Architects:

  Thomas E. Dell

  Designed and coded  the  central  framework  that  MindVox  is  based  upon.
  Amongst his various endeavors Tom  sells an exceptional  series of BBS pack-
  ages that work with various flavors of MSDOS and Unix.  Tom can be contacted
  at  either  one  of  the following electronic addresses, or the P.O. Box for
  Darkside, his organization.

  Bruce Fancher

  Coordinated the VOICES software development effort and prevented things from
  stalling out or reaching dead ends, allowing MindVox to go live pretty close
  to the original  schedule.  Bruce  designed and  implemented MindVox's  User
  Interface  as  well  as most  of the  modifications  and  extensions to  the
  original communications  software.  In addition, he has redesigned and coded
  the internal framwork of the VOICES  software to operate on a  client-server
  paradigm.  Currently Bruce is head of the software development team.
  
  Mark Abene

  Installed  and  trouble-shot our  initial set-up.  Mark was  responsible for
  implementing and fine-tuning our  system security, as well as adding several
  features that exist on the system.

  Dave Heurie

  Has recently joined the Phantom Access Group and is in charge of  networking
  and  making  sure all of the MindVox hardware is talking to all of the other
-- more --                   hardware that keeps us running.  He also works on fine tuning system perfor-
  mance,  trouble-shooting  problems.

  Len Rose

  Len is presently the main system administrator at MindVox and  the  head  of
  Security.

  Comments are welcome.  To mail everyone at  Phantom Access,  simply  address
  your Mail to "phantom" on the system.  MindVox operates on a principle simi-
  lar to RADAR but doesn't FLY out of anything.  Do not be alarmed.

-- more --                   WHAT IS VOX?  
  ============

       MindVox was created out of  our  desire  to  bring  an  innovative  and
  creative  gathering-place  to  the online universe, or "Cyberspace" as it is
  being termed.  While we are a full-featured service provider, our main  goal
  is  one of creating and constantly evolving a unique online community, which
  combines all the features you'd expect from  any  multi-national  commercial
  network or large-scale public access Unix site; coupled with a diverse array
  of individuals and groups who have made their home on MindVox,  weaving  to-
  gether  the threads of countless ideas and dreams, into the social fabric of
  a thriving community.

       To put it simply: we are a PLACE, not just  a  collection  of  services
  grouped  together  with  a price list and termed "system."  There is a great
  deal of text available on us in various periodicals, both hardcopy and elec-
  tronic,  and  a  cross-section of this material is available online.  People
  who are interested in what we are, and how MindVox began are  encouraged  to
  login as guests and read the EDITORIAL.


  FEATURES 
-- more --                   ========

  MindVox is "live" on the Internet and easily accessible  from  over  100,000
  machines  all  over  the  world,  through  the  use of telnet; as well as 24
  direct-dial lines located in NYC, NY.

  A sampling of the features we offer include:

  )> Local MindVox Forums covering topics that span the range from the  evolu-
  tion  of  Cyberspace,  Virtual Reality, Legal Issues, and Security and Virus
  updates and discussions, all the way to Health, Drugs,  Beauty,  Alternative
  Medicine, and Erotica.

  )> Over 1700 Usenet Newsgroups.  We receive a full  newsfeed  with  over  35
  megabytes of news every 24 hours.

  )> Archives containing hundreds of megabytes of  files  and  messages,  from
  systems  that were active from 1978-1991.  These are the collected inception
  of what we now term as "Cyberspace."

  )> Security and Virus conferences and  programs  are  available  online  for
  edification and easy downloading.
-- more --                   )> Custom front-end user interface that allows Members easy  access  to  the
  power  of  the  underlying  MindVox  operating system, without the learning-
  curve.

  )> IRC Live REAL-TIME Conference system.  An average of 500 people from  all
  over the world are online 24 hours a day.

  )> A wide variety of single and multi-player games are online for  your  en-
  joyment.

  ACCESSING MINDVOX 
  =================

  MindVox is physically located in New York City, and a local  call  from  the
  212 or 718 area codes.  We can be reached through telnet, by typing:  telnet
  phantom.com  -- we are also accessible via PC Pursuit, Sprintnet,  and  most
  other discounted data carriers within the United States and Canada.
-- more --                   Our hunt group begins at 212/988-5030.  Our dialups support  speeds  ranging
  from 1200 baud to 19.2Kbps.


  MINDVOX HARDWARE 
  ================

  MindVox usually runs on a NeXT Turbo equipped with 64 megabytes of RAM,  and
  at  present a little over 3 gigabytes of disk storage space are allocated to
  its use.  At times Vox is moved to a  SparcStation2,  also  fitted  with  64
  megabytes  of  RAM.   This  usually happens when we are working on something
  NeXT-specific and need to test things before putting the  system  back  onto
  the central machine.

  Towards the end of 1992 MindVox will permanently move to a SparcServer based
  set-up,  with  2-3  other machines on the network reserved for the exclusive
  use of various system features.


  MINDVOX SOFTWARE 
  ================
-- more --                   MindVox runs  on Voice -- Waffle ][+ the  NeXTSTEP.  In  addition to being a
  silly   name   that  we  somehow  still  manage to  find amusing, Voice is a
  continuously evolving  environment  that  presents  you  with  a  tremendous
  amount  of   flexibility   and  power,  while  providing a comfortable layer
  over  the native  operating  system that Vox runs on.  This allows   you  to
  easily  make  use  of various Unix functions, without needing to  understand
  shell  scripts, Unix syntax, or query formats for obscure programs.

  While Voice is very  powerful and full-featured, it's main  priority  is  to
  provide an easy-to-use and intuitive overlay, that  allows you to make  full
  use of it  without reading  any help files, or  syntax guidelines.

  FEES 
  ====

  For a flat-rate $15 a month fee, you are provided unlimited  access  to  all
  services available on the system.  This includes  the MindVox  Forums, local
  Chat system, The Archives, Single and Multi-Player  Games, Mail, the  Usenet
  Newsgroups, IRC International Conferencing System, and all basic services.

  Internet Memberships are also $10 a month, and  provide  access  to  Usenet,
-- more --                   Software,  Mail,  and  other  services that would fall under the auspices of
  "public access unix".

  New Members receive two  weeks of  free online  use, which  they can  use to
  better orient themselves and become familiar  with everything that is avail-
  able on MindVox.  Thus, your first month of time, actually last for 6 WEEKS.


  Q & A's 
  =======

  [Q]: Are you a hacker board?

  [A]: MindVox is *NOT* a "hacker" board.  Although our Members  include  many
  former  members of various underground cliques such as Knights of Shadow and
  Legion of Doom, none of them are active in the "underground" at the  present
  time.

  Conferences that deal with the topics of system security,  operating  system
  flaws  and  weaknesses  & how to patch them, and various quirks of Unix, are
  available online, as are a collection of some of the world's foremost  secu-
  rity  experts,  including  frequent contributors to CERT, and former writers
-- more --                   and editors of now defunct security mailing lists such as ZARDOZ,  SPLINTER,
  and  CORE.   However,  the exchange or solicitation of others, to perform or
  take part in, any illegal activity is strictly prohibited.

  Learning = Good, Crime = Bad.  Screwing with computer systems that don't be-
  long to you, isn't very nice, it's also illegal -- if this is the reason you
  are logging into MindVox, don't bother calling.  We  believe  wholeheartedly
  in  the underlying principles of the hacker ethic, at the same time, the old
  excuse of "I just want to get into system X to learn . . ." no longer  holds
  true  in this day and age of VERY affordable hardware and FREE software.  If
  it's not yours, and you haven't been invited; you have NO  right  to  access
  it.


  [Q]: Do I have access to telnet, irc, internet games and mail and Unix  type
  of things on MindVox?

  [A]: In a word, YES.  Although we are not a "public access  Unix"  we  offer
  all the services of one under our VOICES wrapper.


  [Q]: Is usage limited in any way?  Are there  additional  charges  for  any-
-- more --                   thing?

  [A]: No.  flat-rate, is exactly what it states.  You may login as often, and
  as long as you want with NO additional sur-charges.


  [Q]: How can I make voice contact with Phantom Access, if I am having  prob-
  lems, or want to talk to someone voice about something?

  [A]: Dial +1 (212) 988-5987.  There is someone available to help you  during
  normal  office  hours,  or you can leave a message and we'll get back to you
  the next business day.

     with topics  ranging from Hot Sex  to Plastic Plants.  There  are an
     average of 450 users online at any given time, a figure that doubles
     or  triples during  certain "peak hours" in  various countries.

                         MindVox [HARDWARE] Information

     The central MindVox system is comprised  of the following components:

     MindVox usually runs on a NeXT Turbo with  64  megabytes of  RAM.  At
     times the system is moved to a Sun SparcStation 2, also equipped with
     64 megabytes of RAM.  The machines are fitted with NeXTSTEP  and Open
     Windows/Solaris  respectively.  The NeXT  runs  under  the Mach  Unix
     kernel, while the Sparc uses SunOS Unix.
     
     MindVox itself is pretty much POSIX compliant  and happy to live any-
     where big and fast and Unix-like.  --  If none of  this has made much
     sense to you, don't worry about it, there  isn't a quiz later, and it
     only matters to the  propeller-heads that spend their  days living in
     the land  of Xinu and  find  themselves curious about  what  hardware
     keeps Phantom Access aloft.
     
     In any case, the machinery is connected to an Ethernet that allocates
     roughly 3.2 gigabytes of storage to MindVox via NFS.  There are other
     bits and pieces hooked into the  network such as an HP DAT that backs
-- more --                      the system up onto 8 gigabyte  DDS tapes; a 16 line  terminal server;
     an 8 line SCSI / Serial device;  a dedicated TeleBit for polling News
     24 hours a day; a live link to the Internet for telnet; 24  modems of
     various flavors, including USR Dual Standard,  TeleBit, Zyxel, Supra,
     CompuCom, and Hayes.  The system is designed to  support between 30-
     50 simultaneous users comfortably.
     
     Local dial in lines support speeds ranging from 1200 bps to 19.2kbps.

                    MindVox [NYC/NY STATE - MEMBERS] Notice

  Welcome to MindVox!

  Most of the people at Phantom Access have been hanging out in the  NYC  area
  telecommunications  scene,  for the better part of a decade.  Over the years
  we have run some half-dozen different systems in the NY area.  Although many
  --  actually most -- of 'em were of a slightly (ahem) different variety than
  MindVox, the main lesson we learned from these past experiences is the  fact
  that  people  don't like to be hassled -- that's what the real world is for,
  why put up with it in Cyberspace?

  MindVox is not the EMPIRE OF PHANTOM ACCESS, GIVE US YOUR HOME PHONE  NUMBER
  WITH  A  NOTARIZED  SIGNATURE,  A  XEROX OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE, YOUR SHOE
  SIZE, AND YOU BETTER NOT PISS OFF THE SYSOPS WHO ARE GOD HERE . . . actually
  we  don't really care about anything you might choose to do here, as long as
  it's not illegal.  All things are tolerated to a great extent,  if  you  are
  disruptive or annoying, then some of the Members will let you know about it.

  Basically we're pretty mellow, there aren't any rules,  except  the  obvious
-- more --                   one  of:  don't  act like a jerk, or people won't like you.  If you wanna be
  despised, that's cool too.  Hey, whatever does it for ya.

  There are some things on MindVox that may be slightly confusing if  you  are
  coming  from a background of PCBoard, Galacticomm, FidoNET, or whatever fla-
  vor of MSDOS system you're used to.  Vox is "live" on  the  Internet,  which
  means that many -- as of this writing, MOST -- of the Members are NOT physi-
  cally located in NY, they're logged in from all over the world  through  the
  net.   By the same token, MindVox has "Gateways" into the Internet where you
  can access a wide spectrum of services you may not know about.

  Some Internet services you may not be familiar with, and find enjoyable  in-
  clude: the Usenet Newsgroups, which number around 1600 at any given time and
  reach some two million (2,000,000) people from all  over  the  world.   Then
  there's  IRC  which  is a world-wide REAL-TIME "Chat" system, which averages
  around 500 people online 24 hours a day.  What this means to you is IRC acts
  like  a  "door"  into a net, where there are several hundred other people to
  hang out with.

  The previous paragraphs have only skimmed the surface of what is  available,
  for more information on the Internet and Usenet, there are many articles and
  files available in the online ARCHIVES.
-- more --                   If you have problems with anything, please let the  system  management  know
  through the use of FEEDBACK, so that we can un-confuse you, or fix the prob-
  lem if its at our end.

  Enjoy,

  Phantom Access

                                  [Jan / 11 / 1993] 
  
          [%] Important Information TOO SECRET to be Printed here! [%]

  Hey! -- although this is a warm and fuzzy form-letter, it  doth  pertain  to
  thee,  so  please read, assimilate, comprehend, understand and laminate this
  document at your earliest possible convenience.

  During the next three weeks (that's until the end of January,  earth  time),
  MindVox  will  be moving sideways and becoming an even greater menace to the
  social fabric of the 20th century.

  In other words, we are moving to larger offices downtown.  'Cuz if a big of-
  fice isn't downtown, then what good is it anyway . . . ?

  From YOUR point of view, everything you do to contact  MindVox  will  remain
  unchanged.   Our  main hunt group in NYC will still begin with 212-988-5030,
  or if you are using telnet to access us, phantom.com we shall  remain  until
  the end of all songs.
                 
  Since Vox will be moving onto entirely new equipment, for a brief instant in
-- more --                   history,  a parallel rift shall open within time and space and there will be
  TWO of MindVox, they will fight a duel, and the winner will banish the loser
  to  the  alternate  universe where the Amiga and NeXT rule in harmony, MSDOS
  has died the ugly death it deserves and Bill Gates is a penniless pauper.

  Anyway, here is the basic, general, top-down, kinda overview of  what  shall
  be happenin'

          -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -

    ->  MindVox will be moving from the main system it lives on right  now  (a
  NeXT  Turbo)  to  a  LAN; the main MindVox machine will become a SparcSERVER
  with 128mb RAM, the auxiliary Vox server  will  be  the  SparcStation2  with
  64mb,  which will house various extensions to MindVox which run through tel-
  net sessions, sockets, whatever . . .

    -> Right now when you call MindVox and the phone  rings,  and  rings,  and
  rings  and  .  .  . it means all 16 physical dial-ups are FULL at the moment
  (they get that was FAST during prime-time which runs from around  4pm  until
  4am  .  . . lot of primetime in there huh?).  Our local lines double from 16
  to 32.  16 of them will be TeleBit WorldBlazer modems; to blurb briefly-

-- more --                       DISTINCTIVE FEATURES

      - PEP -
      Telebit's original PEP divided the telephone channel into 511 carrier
      frequencies and used sophisticated error checking to provide the
      highest throughput and most robust connectivity in the industry.

      - Turbo PEP -
      Telebit has improved PEP with enhanced packetization and up to seven
      bits per carrier.  The net result is data rates of up to 23,000 bps
      *without* data compression.  The WorldBlazer also uses Trellis Coding
      to provide even more robust connectivity over poor channels than our
      original PEP.  Turbo PEP provides optimum performance by matching the
      channel as closely as 10 bps.

      - Universal Compatibility -
      The WorldBlazer transparently connects with the large installed base
      of PEP modems and also supports all CCITT standard modulations.  It
      transparently connects with other V.32bis and V.32 modems at 14,400,
      12,000, 9600, 7200, and 4800 bps; V.22bis modems at 2400 bps; V.22
      and Bell 212A modems at 1200 bps; and V.21 and Bell 103J modems at
      300 bps.
-- more --                       - Data Compression -
      CCITT V.42bis data compression now provides capabilities of up to 4:1
      for both Turbo PEP and CCITT modulation modes yielding data rates in
      excess of 70,000 bps.  The WorldBlazer is backward compatible with
      both Telebit Lempel-Ziv compression and MNP 5.

      - Fastest DTE Speeds -
      The WorldBlazer supports DTE speeds of up to 115,200 bps, allowing
      the highest throughput in the industry.

  [end blurb]

    The remaining 16 lines will be running at 2400/9600 for a couple of  weeks
  until  we  upgrade  them  to  some other type of v32.bis (+) modem (Motorola
  V.Fast compliant modems, or something similar.  Perhaps USRs  if  they  have
  cleaned up their firmware to work properly with Unix by then).

    -> Our Bandwidth will increase to Fractional-T1.  What this means is:

       o FTP, FSP and DCC (under IRC) will all be turned on.  WaReZ DooD!

-- more --                        o MindVox will NFS-mount several mirror sites into the Archives, the
         end result of this is a transparent integration of local and network
         services into one contiguous-appearing filesystem which contains some
         35-40 GIGABYTES of software available for download.  MORE wareZ do0d!

       o Telnet will be approx 25 times as fast (in other words, being hooked
         into MindVox over the net, will be pretty much the same speed as if
         you were huddled beneath the shadowy monoliths aglow with flickering
         light where MindVox hums to itself and plots to WAKE UP and become
         one the Matrix).

       o We will be running our own IRC server.  Yes that's right kids, get
         IRC-COP &  become a totalitarian menace to society, annoying everyone
         unfortunate enough to even look at you out of  the  corner  of  their
         eye.

       o Joining IRC will be the ICB network, along with a THIRD worldwide
         network that MindVox will be beta-testing.  (Shhhh!)

       o A complete INFORMATION-NAVIGATION package will come online.  More
         details soon!

-- more --                     -> NEWS will say bye-bye and wish PSI a warm farewell, moving onto an up
       to the minute NNTP server, instead of the 2-days  old  mess  which  PSI
       sees fit to send its clients right now.

    -> About 10 new games will come online, some of them multi-player, making
       way for the introduction of MaelStrom making its debut . . .

       . . . which leads to:

          -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -

       The current phase of system growth/solidification, will  take  us  into
  Feb  / March, around which time MindVox itself will be fairly stable and not
  liable to FLY out of anything, or make SUDDEN CHANGES and SHARP TURNS.

       Most effort at this stage will begin focusing on getting at  least  our
  basic  Point  &  Click GUI's running for the PC, Mac & X -- and making Mael-
  Strom wake up from its slumber and take corporeal form.

       Ok, thats it for now, in at least the immediate  future  it  is  HIGHLY
  RECOMMENDED (IN CAPITAL LETTERS) that you read the NEWS section of the Mind-
  Vox forums to keep up with what's going on, or you'll fall behind  the  rest
-- more --                   of the class and they'll all laugh at you.

  You can read news by typing (drum roll): read news  at the main menu.  If
  you want to, you can also JOIN news, to have it automatically picked up by
  your New message Scan.


  As a wise man once said, it's hard to hold a candle  in  the  cold  November
  rain.

  z00m

  Patrick & Bruce & Stu & Lee & Andy & Jack & Dave & Yuri &  Kai  &  Bill  and
  like  whoever else I am forgetting, remind me that you exist and are chained
  up in our dungeon.

  Thanks, and enjoy the show.

  Everyone at Phantom Access!

                              Terms & Conditions

  Version: 04/01/92

GENERAL/INTRODUCTION

  01. Phantom Access Technologies, Inc. (PAT) agrees to provide access to  its
  MindVox  (TM)  online  service (System) to Member using the Terms and Condi-
  tions outlined below.

OWNERSHIP / COPYRIGHT

  02. The entire contents of System are copyrighted as a collective work under
  the  Copyright  laws of the United States.  The copy, transfer, reproduction
  or publication of any part of System in any form is prohibited,  unless  ex-
  pressly  authorized by PAT.  Members who place data, information, or charac-
-- more --                   terization of events on System, grant PAT the right to edit, copy,  publish,
  or distribute such information as it sees fit.  Under the provisions of this
  grant, Member reserves his or her individual copyright on any  original  ma-
  terial posted to System.

INFORMATION CONTENT

  03. System may only be used for lawful purposes.  PAT does not  allow  copy-
  righted  material  to  be  placed  on System without the owner's permission.
  Transmission in any form, of any information that violates U.S. or state re-
  gulations  is  prohibited.  Member agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PAT
  from any claims resulting from Member's use of service which  causes  damage
  to Member or another party.

  04. Since PAT does not monitor or in any way exercise control over  the  in-
  formation  passing through System, complying with all U.S. federal and state
  laws and regulations rests solely upon the Member.  Members  agrees  not  to
  engage  in any form of solicitation or advertising through the use of System
  without express prior written permission from PAT.  In no event  may  Member
  use  the facilities of System to conduct any business or activity or solicit
  the performance of any activity which is prohibited by U.S. federal or state
  law or to solicit PAT Members to become customers, subscribers or members of
-- more --                   any other online service.

BILLING

  to, any registration  or  validation  fees,  hourly  usage  charges,  excess
  storage  charges, communications surcharges, and any other fees for the bil-
  ling period during  which  those  fees  are  incurred.   Accounts  are  non-
  transferable  and Member agrees to be solely responsible for all charges in-
  curred by account(s) belonging to Member.  Member is responsible for charges
  at  the time service is used.  Accounts are billed at least monthly and pay-
  ment is due upon receipt of invoice.  PAT reserves the right to suspend  ac-
  cess  to  service for any account(s) billed by invoice if payment is not re-
  ceived within fourteen (14) days of invoice  date.   Member  is  immediately
  placed  in default and subject to a $25 dollar returned check charge if pay-
  ment is returned to us unpaid.  PAT reserves the right to  suspend  or  ter-
  minate access to service from Member's account(s) immediately upon rejection
  of any credit card charges or indication of credit problems.  If account  is
  in  default  Member's deposit will be used to cover cost of charges with the
  remainder of deposit remitted to Member.  In the event that deposit does not
  cover charges incurred, Member agrees to indemnify and hold PAT harmless for
-- more --                   all claims and expenses, including attorney and collection agency fees,  re-
  lated to Member's violation of this Terms and Conditions agreement.

  06. PAT reserves the right at its sole discretion to  suspend  or  terminate
  Member  account(s) access to System at any time, for any reason.  In such an
  event Member will receive remittance of deposit  within  thirty  (30)  days,
  minus  whatever  charges  have  been incurred by Member prior to termination
  date.  Suspension or termination of service does not relieve Member from ob-
  ligation to remit full payment for charges incurred.  Only a written request
  for termination of service given thirty (30) days in advance of  termination
  relieves  Member  of  the  obligation  to  pay  monthly charges for Member's
  account(s).

[;H[2J
                       MindVox [HELP: ARCHIVES] Reference


[File Location Commands]

C)hange   - Move to a new directory.  This command is used to go down the
            file system tree.  Your current directory is always displayed
            right above the Archives prompt.  You may view the file listing
            in the current directory with the D)ir command.

D)ir      - View the listing of files in the current directory.  Among the
            information displayed is the file name, file size in bytes,
            date of upload, and a single line text description of the file.

F)ind     - Locate a file by title.  If you quickly want to locate a file
            anywhere in the Archives section, and you know part of the
            file name, this command is very useful in quickly locating
            the file.

M)aster   - Move to the top of the directory tree.  This is an easy way
            for you to return to the root directory, as opposed to using
-- more --                             the .) command multiple times.

.)        - Move back to previous directory.  This performs the exact
            opposite function of the C)hange command.


[File Transfer Commands]

A)rc      - View the contents of an .arc, .lzh, or .zip file.  This command
            will display a list of files and their attributes that are
            located within an archive file.  If you download an archived
            file, be sure that you have the correct program to extract
            the files contained therein.  Use ARC for .arc files, LHARC for
            .lzh files, and PKZIP for .zip files.

P)rotocol - Set Transfer Protocol. Mindvox currently supports the Xmodem,
            Ymodem and Zmodem protocols.

R)eceive  - Upload a file to Mindvox. Be sure you are using the same
            protocol on Mindvox and in your terminal software, and your
            settings are 8N1.

-- more --                 S)end     - Download a file from Mindvox. The above rule also applies.

V)iew     - View a text file. This allows you to download or simply view
            a text file without the use of a protocol.  You can view files
            online, as well as buffer and save them with your terminal
            software.

W)rite    - Write text to a file.  This allows you to upload a text file
            without the use of a protocol.  This command can also be used
            for creating small text files (ie: readme.txt) on the system.


[Other Commands]

H)elp     - Displays the online help screen.

Q)uit     - Leave the Archives section and return to the main menu.

[Topic]: forums
[;H[2J
                        MindVox [HELP: FORUMS] Reference

  The MindVox Forums are divided into AREAS and FORUMS.  AREAS refer to a com-
  mon  "umbrella"  of related topics, for example:  CYBERSPACE is an AREA that
  encompasses many individual FORUMS that somehow pertain to the central theme
  of CYBERSPACE.

  To move through the various AREAS you can either use the GO command and type
  out their full or partial names, or make use of the ">" and "<" keys to move
  up or down the MindVox AREAS respectively.

  To do the same thing with FORUMS you may also use the GO command, or the "+"
  and "-" keys to move back and forth through the Forums or Newsgroups.


                               -=[> Commands <]=-

  When you are reading the various messages that comprise the MindVox  Forums,
  you  are  in a separate sub-section of MindVox where a different set of com-
  mands is active.  This is similar to the ARCHIVES, HOME,  MAIL,  STATUS  and
  other sub-menus.
-- more --                   However, there are certain FORUM commands that will work  from  the  central
  MindVox menu.  These include: ABOUT, GO, NEW and UNJOIN.  A detailed listing
  of the Forum commands follows.

  ABOUT     -

  About will present you with a listing that tells you ABOUT  the  Forum  that
  you are presently in.  If you want information about any particular Forum on
  MindVox, supply it in the form of an argument.

     For example: ABOUT UNIX

  Would cause MindVox to pattern-match "UNIX" and read  the  information  file
  about  the  Area: Computers  Forums: Unix.  If you would like information on
  ALL available MindVox Forums, then use the command:  ABOUT ALL

  Note that About ONLY works on MindVox Forums,  it  does  absolutely  nothing
  when you query it about Newsgroups.

  AGAIN     -

-- more --                   Again re-reads the message that you have just read.  It simply means "I want
  to read this message AGAIN!"

  BACK      -

  Go BACKwards and read the previous message.  If there is  no  previous  mes-
  sage, BACK will act as AGAIN and re-read the current message.

  CANCEL    -

  The CANCEL command is used to delete a message that you  have  posted.   You
  can  only  remove  messages  that have been posted from your account.  Other
  people's messages will not be effected by invoking this command.  See  also: 
  POST

  CATCH     -

  Catch is used to mark all the messages in the Forum or  Newsgroup  that  you
  are  presently  in,  as having been read.  This is useful if a section has a
  lot of new messages and you want to reset your NEWscan so that it thinks you
  have  already  seen  all  of  them.  This is especially handy in some of the
  high-traffic Usenet Newsgroups and MindVox Forums.  It can be  essential  if
-- more --                   you  don't  call  very  often and JOINed a lot of different Forums and News-
  groups.

  DOWNLOAD  -

  Download is used to download the current message with whatever protocol  you
  have  selected in STATUS (X, Y, Z modem, or Kermit).  Normally you would not
  want to download short messages, because its not worth  the  hassle  if  you
  just  want  to  read  a  few  paragraphs.   However,  many  people belong to
  mailing-lists or receive electronic journals or digests through the net  and
  these  can  be quite lengthy.  The download feature is implemented primarily
  for this purpose.

  FOLLOW    -

  This command allows you to FOLLOW-up on a message or letter, including quot-
  ed text within your reply.  This can help a great deal if you need to estab-
  lish context.  MANY messages travel strange and arduous routes  before  set-
  tling into a Newsgroup or mailing-list, and if you send mail to someone ask-
  ing about some message they posted last month . . . they might have no  idea
  what  you're  talking  about  if you don't include a piece of the message to
  remind them!
-- more --                      For example:  [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: FOLLOW

  Although FOLLOW assumes that the intended recipient is also  the  author  of
  the message or letter, an address other than that of the original sender can
  be specified.  For example you may want to comment  on  something  you  have
  just  seen posted somewhere and send along an example of what you're talking
  about.

     For example: [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: FOLLOW eric@clapton.com  Would  allow
  you  to  include quotes from message #42 to eric, even if message #42 wasn't
  from eric.

  Multiple addresses can also be specified.

     For  example:   [Return]  1-42,  [Q]uit:  FOLLOW  eric@clapton.com,  tuc,
  dave@hamster.org   Would  send  mail  to eric and dave at the Internet sites
  clapton.com and hamster.org, respectively, and to the MindVox  Member  named
  Tuc.  See also:  FORWARD, POST

  FORWARD   -

-- more --                   Forward works in a way that is similar to FOLLOW but instead of allowing the
  insertion  of  quoted  text into the body of your message, it simply sends a
  verbatim copy of the message or letter to the recipient(s) you want to  send
  copies to.  Forward the mail command has NOTHING to do with FORWARD files in
  the HOME section of MindVox.  See also:  FOLLOW, POST

  GO        -

  The GO command is used to move to another Forum or Newsgroup.  You  can  ei-
  ther  type its complete name, or just a few characters.  Based upon how much
  information you have provided, MindVox will do its best to pattern-match the
  text to the Area you want to enter.  You do not have to be JOINed to a Forum
  or Newsgroup in order to GO there.

  INDEX     -

  Prints a complete listing of the available Forums or Newgroups, depending on
  which section you are presently in.  This is identical to the main menu com-
  mands VOXLIST and USELIST respectively.

  LIST      -

-- more --                   The LIST command prints the last couple of messages that have been posted to
  the Forum or Newsgroup that you are in.  It can be supplied with an argument
  in the form of a number.

     For example: LIST 30

  Would list the last 30 messages.  You can also LIST by AUTHOR  or  ORGANIZA-
  TION, although in the Forums or Newsgroups LIST defaults to SUBJECT.

  MAIL      -

  Identical to the SEND command in MAIL.

  NEW       -

  The NEW command is used to do a scan for New messages in the MindVox  Forums
  and  Usenet  Newsgroups  that you have asked to be JOINed to.  It only scans
  for new messages in the areas that you want to read, it will  not  find  new
  messages in sections you have not told MindVox you wish to be JOINed to.

  POST      -

-- more --                   POST is used to enter a new message to one of the Forums.  You will be asked
  if  you  want  to continue with the current Subject, or select a new one; if
  you are posting to a Usenet Newsgroup you may also  be  asked  a  series  of
  questions  regarding  distribution,  cross-posting, and queries that pertain
  exclusively to the Usenet NEWS software.

  After supplying the required Subject information, you will  be  placed  into
  the  editor you have configured using the STATUS command from the main Mind-
  Vox menu.  See also:  CANCEL

  QUIT      -

  Quit from the Forums or Newsgroups and exit back to the central menu.

  SEARCH    -

  Allows you to do a SEARCH on the current Forum you are in.  You  may  search
  by  AUTHOR,  KEYWORDS, or SUBJECT.  This command is useful if there are hun-
  dreds or thousands of messages in an Area, and you are looking for  messages
  that  pertain  to some specific piece of information, or have been posted by
  one particular person.

-- more --                   (Un)JOIN  -

  Typing JOIN on a Newsgroup that you already JOINed, serves as  a  toggle  to
  UN-JOIN it and remove it from your NEWscan.

  WRITE     -

  Write will save the current letter or message into   a  file  in  your  HOME
  directory.  If the file already exists, then the current message will be ap-
  pended to the file.

  For example:   [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: write

                 [Appended to file /member/messages]

  Would append the current message to the end of your mailbox.  You  can  also
  specify a filename, for example:  [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: write cars.forsale

                 [Written to file: /member/cars.forsale]

  As you may or may not have noticed, all text that pertains to  your  account
  ends  up  in  your HOME directory in one form or another.  You can load your
-- more --                   mail into editors, send it to other places, or sort it  all  out  using  the
  tools  provided in your HOME area.  You can also MAIL files that you edit or
  download from that section, or WRITE from the Forums or Newsgroups.

                A Short Guide to Anonymous ftp

Introduction

A great deal of useful information is stored in files at computers
throughout the country and the world. Many of these file are freely
available to users of the Internet. A simple method for transferring such
files from a remote computer to a users computer is anonymous ftp.
Anonymous ftp allows a user to transfer files without having an account
at the remote computer (i.e. the user is anonymous.)

How Do I Access an Anonymous ftp site?

To access an anonymous ftp site you must know the address of the site. 
For example, nic.ddn.mil, is the address of the Network Information Center
of the Dept. of Defense Network. 

The procedure for accessing an anonymous ftp site follows:

==================================================================

EXAMPLE: 
-- more --                 1       ftp nic.ddn.mil
2       Connected to nic.ddn.mil
3       220 NIC.DDN.MIL FTP Server Process 5z(47)-6 at Tue 30-Jul-91 
        12:56-PDT
4       Name  (nic.ddn.mil:msmith) : anonymous
5       Password  (nic.ddn.mil:anonymous) :---------
6       331 ANONYMOUS  user ok, send real ident as password.
7       230 User ANONYMOUS logged in at Tue  30-Jul-91  12:56-PDT,  job
        46.
8       ftp>

==================================================================
Figure 1



Step by Step Explanation of Figure 1

1       at the prompt, user ftps to nic.ddn.mil
2       user is connected to ftp site
3       site notes the time of user login
-- more --                 4       user login as anonymous
5       user uses password of guest which does not appear on screen
6-7     system acknowledges user login and notes time
8       ftp prompt

Once you have gained access to the site, the ftp> prompt returns and
acknowledges that the system is ready to use.  

Listing the Directories and Changing Directories

Once you have accessed the ftp site,  to transfer a file, you may have to 
change directories to the directory that your file is located in.  It is a
good idea to list the contents of the directory before attempting to
transfer a file.

==================================================================

EXAMPLE:

1       230- Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
2           Starting cwd is /pub.
3       230 Local time is: Wed Jul 31 14:18:29 1991

17      ftp> cd nic
18      250 CWD command successful.
19      ftp> ls
20      200 PORT command successful.
21      150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.

23      networking.terms
24      226 Transfer complete.
25      74 bytes received in 0.11 seconds (0.66 Kbytes/s)

27      200 PORT command successful.
28      150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for interest.groups (721283
        bytes).
29      226 Transfer complete.

                Step by Step Explanation of Figure 2

1-3             ftp site allows user access
4               ftp prompt:  user ls (lists) possible directories
5-6             system acknowledges ls command and begins sequence
7-14            listing of directories
15-16           system completes search and notes the time the search took
17              ftp prompt:  user cd (changes directory) into nic
-- more --                 18              system acknowledges change of directory
19              ftp prompt:  user lists possible files under the nic directory
20-21           system acknowledges ls (list) command 
22-23           possible files
24-25           system acknowledges search and notes time for search
26              ftp prompt: user tells system to download file
                "interest.groups" to his own system
27-31           system downloads file "interests.group" and notes size and
                time of file transfer
32              ftp prompt:  user logs off ftp site
33              system acknowledges system signoff
34              Unix prompt

Unix Commands for Retrieving Files

Unix directories are hierarchal.
In Figure 2  some simple Unix commands were used to change directories
and list possible directories or files (i.e. move up or down the hierarchy.)

the ls command lists the contents of the active directory

the cd <directory name> command enables the user to change directories  
-- more --                         (move up or down the hierarchy)

the cd ..  command allows the user to return to the previous directory,
        using this command it is possible to return to the initial directory

*** Note - not all ftp sites are Unix capable****


Transferring a document

It is possible to view a document while you are sill in an ftp site.  The
command sequence is similar to step 26 of figure 2, the difference being,
a continuation of the command sequence with, |less
For example:

To transfer document: 
        get <filename>

To view the document while still connected to the ftp site
        get <filename> |less

It is also possible to view the document that you have transferred into
-- more --                 your own system after you have left the ftp site and returned to your own
system.
In figure 2, steps 23 and 29 show the user transferring the file and then
quitting the ftp site.  The transferred file is stored in the user's system
under its original title. So in figure 2, the file was transferred and stored
as, "interest.groups".   The procedure is as follows.

get "filename" "new filename"  <return>

The file "filename" is stored in the users system under "new filename"

To view the document transferred, use either "more" or "pg"

more "filename" allows your to scroll through the document

the pg "filename" command allows you to view the document one screen
at a time

Notes

- It is generally a good idea to list the contents of possible directories
before transferring a file via anonymous ftp. Names and locations of
-- more --                 directories and files may change over time. By checking your listing of
possible directories and files, you increase your chances of successfully
transferring a file.

- Anonymous ftp site systems sometimes acknowledge user commands
with confusing responses.  For example, following a change directory
command, the system may respond with a comment such as, "Default name
accepted Send password to connect to it." A user may find this response
confusing. This is yet another reason to list, the contents of directories to
determine that you have accessed the correct directory.

                   MindVox [HELP: (MAIL) GATEWAYS] Reference

  The MindVox system is "live" on the Internet.  This means that approximately
  three  million  (3,000,000) people all over the world, who are either on the
  Internet, or Usenet, are directly accessible through the mail system.

  To send to any one of these people you simply use  the  standard  format  of
  someone@somewhere.com  or you can use a uucp !bang path if desired or neces-
  sary.  This is no big trick and if you need to send Internet/Usenet mail, we
  are  working  under the assumption that you know who you are sending to, and
  how to do it.

  If everything you have read so far is causing you to be confused,  then  you
  might  want  to  take  a  look in the ARCHIVES under the Cyberspace/Internet
  heading and scan through a few of the excellent files  that  are  available,
  detailing the Internet and Usenet, and how to make use of them.

  This help file is mainly concerned with explaining how to get mail into OTH-
  ER networks that are NOT on "the net."  In the past this was outright impos-
  sible, but lately as the global visions of a single Matrix  world-net  which
  encompasses  all smaller subnets within its strata, begin to take form, most
-- more --                   major networks have GATEWAYS sets up that let you at least communicate  with
  all of their members through mail.

  There are certain exceptions to this rule, but  generally  speaking,  almost
  every   major   network   on   earth  is  becoming  accessible  through  the
  Internet/Usenet.  The remainder of this article deals with the mechanics  of
  getting  mail  into  -- and in some cases, out of -- these scattered systems
  and their disparate protocols and methods of access.


     =)> AppleLink

  AppleLink is a network run by Quantum Services for the benefit of people us-
  ing  Apple  Computers.  This is slowly being folded into the parent corpora-
  tions  AoL  service, but at present it exists as  a  separate  entity,  much
  like  QuantumLink  for  Commodore  computers  and  PCLink  for PC Compatible
  machines.

     To send mail into AppleLink use the format:  user@applelink.apple.com


     =)> ATTMail (AT&T Mail)
-- more --                   AT&T operates an electronic mail service similar to MCI  Mail  (see  below),
  and its users can be reaching by using a similar format to AppleLink.

     Sending mailing into ATTMAIL:  user@attmail.com


     =)> BITNET (Because It's Time)

  For the most part Bitnet is a collection  of  creaking  mainframe  monoliths
  manufactured by IBM during the stone ages, that are used to connect together
  a large number of smaller  college  and  governmental  organizations.   Most
  traffic into and out of these systems still goes over 9600bps leased lines.

     The format for sending to a person connected to Bitnet, is:

        USER%SYSTEM.BITNET@cunyvm.cuny.edu


     =)> BIX (Byte Information eXchange)

  Bix was created for the readers of BYTE  Magazine  to  exchange  information
-- more --                   with each other and maintain a running dialogue with the magazine's publish-
  ers and editors.  It can still be reached through the DAS Gateway.

     To send mail into BIX:  user@dcibix.das.net


     =)> Compu$erve (Also known as CIS)

  Although Compuserve is not a "real" network, it  is  currently  the  largest
  commercial information provider in the world.  Among other things, it offers
  its clients electronic mail, and the ability to access public  forums  where
  discussions  can  take  place,  similar  to what goes on in the Usenet News-
  groups.

  It is fairly simple to send mail into Compuserve, the only limitation  being
  that  you MUST know the intended party's CIS user-id.  There is currently no
  matching facility to look up a name and connect it with a string of  numbers
  that Compuserve will be able to deal with.

     The format for sending to a client of Compu$serve is:

        77777.10983@compuserve.com
-- more --                   Basically this just consists of changing the CIS "," to a dot  "."  so  that
  Unix mailers can handle the addressing.  If you want to get mail OUT OF Com-
  puserve and into the Internet, you must place a ">INTERNET:" in front of the
  address.

     For example:  >INTERNET:phantom@mindvox.phantom.com


     =)> EasyNet (Digital)

  Digital (not to be confused with Patrick), sells a service called EasyNet.

     To send mail into EasyNet use the format:  user@host.enet.dec.com

                                           or:  user%host.enet@decwrl.dec.com


     =)> FidoNET

  FidoNET consists of about 8,000 machines, almost all of them are PC compati-
  ble  and  running  MSDOS.   It's currently the world's largest microcomputer
-- more --                   network, and has evolved into  a  somewhat  complex  hierarchy  arranged  by
  zones, regions, nets, systems and points.

     An example of a FidoNET address is:  Eugene Spodunk at 1:666:13.2

  Wherein the "1" is the ZONE (1 = North America), 666 is the NET, 13  is  the
  SYSTEM (machine), and 2 is the POINT (points are "private" systems which are
  hanging off someone else's machine -- it should be noted that  most  systems
  are not POINTS).

  Since the above address is syntactically equivalent to line noise as far  as
  Unix  is  concerned,  you would have to translate it into a format that will
  make sense to more conventional mailers.

     The above address would become: Eugene.Spodunk@p2.f13.n666.z1.fidonet.org

  Assuming that a POINT was not present, the "p2" would be  dropped  from  the
  mail address and it would become:  Eugene.Spodunk@f13.n666.z1.fidonet.org


     =)> MCIMAIL

-- more --                   MCI operates a network for electronic mail called MCI Mail (you never woulda
  guessed right?)  Mail to their customers can be sent using the format:

        2120912@mcimail.com


     =)> PeaceNet

  PeaceNet can be reached by writing to the address:  user@igc.org


  This comprises a listing of some of the networks accessible through the  In-
  ternet.   It is by no means complete, and if you desire to make contact with
  people who are connected to other nets, you should ask them to  query  their
  system  administrators  about  how this might be possible, while at the same
  time sending us FEEDBACK and posing the same question,  so  that  people  at
  both ends of the link can figure out a way of helping you connect.

  If you are sure that you're doing everything  right,  but  still  experience
  difficulty,  then  don't  hesitate to leave FEEDBACK stating your problem as
  explicitly as possible, so that we can help you get your messages through.

[;H[2J
                         MindVox [HELP: HOME] Reference

  The HOME section of MindVox is an area that contains all  of  your  personal
  files,  as  well as system information that pertains to your account and can
  be modified by YOU.  Various files exist that can change the ways  in  which
  MindVox responds to your input, what it does with your Mail, and what infor-
  mation is available about you to be exported to other Members of MindVox.

  The HOME area is presently expanding as more commands are  added  and  minor
  changes  are  implemented  in  the ways that existing commands interact with
  your account.  The following file is complete as of 08/31/92 and  likely  to
  change  in the near future.  If something just WON'T WORK no matter what you
  try, leave FEEDBACK.

  HOME is broken down into two main sections.   Commands  that  allow  you  to
  manipulate  your  files,  and Files that have special meaning to MindVox and
  change the ways in which the system responds to your account.


                      -=[> File Manipulation Commands <]=-

-- more --                   COPY      -

  Copy simply creates a duplicate of a file.  The format  of  the  command  is
  COPY  <a>  <b> where <a> is the name of the file you want to make a copy of,
  and <b> is the name of the new file you are creating, which will be  identi-
  cal to <a> except for its name.

     For example:  COPY mail1 mail2

  DIR       -

  DIRectory catalogs your Home directory and lists all the files that you have
  stored in your area.

  DELETE    -

  Delete is used to remove files that you no longer want to keep around.  Your
  individual storage limit is 100K which is more than sufficient for most pur-
  poses.  The only time this limit would be exceeded is if you  download  many
  mailing  lists  or files, and then keep them laying around in your directory
  instead of downloading them.  The DELETE command is used to get rid of files
  you  have downloaded to your home system or no longer need.  We would appre-
-- more --                   ciate you removing no-longer needed files, promptly.

  EDIT      -

  Edit can be supplied with an arguement in the format of EDIT  <filename>  if
  you  want  to  make changes to an existing file, or just supply the name for
  your new file before you create it, instead of being prompted for it  after-
  wards.  Edit is used to write/change/delete text to your files.  You will be
  placed in whatever editor you have selected from the main STATUS menu  (usu-
  ally VISUAL or LINE).

  RENAME    -

  Rename just changes the name of a file to something else.   The  format  for
  using  rename  is  the  same  as the one used for COPY; RENAME <a> <b>.  The
  difference is that Rename does not make  another  copy  of  <a>,  it  simply
  alters the name of <a> to <b>.

     For example:  RENAME file23 dead.poets

  TAIL      -

-- more --                   This is command that is mostly used to view selected chunks of  LARGE  files
  where  you  don't  want to scroll through the whole thing in order to get to
  the end.  It's format is:  TAIL <n> <filename> where <n> is  the  number  of
  lines that you want to display from the file.

     For example: TAIL 50 dead.poets

  Would print the last 50 lines from the file "dead.poets" to your screen.

  VIEW      -

  View is used to view text files.  The format is: VIEW <filename>.


                       -=[> User Configuration Files <]=-

             [PLEASE NOTE: ALL FILENAMES SHOULD BE IN *LOWERCASE!*]

  ALIASES   -

  FORWARD   -

-- more --                   Forward is a file that lists an address that you want to forward all of your
  incoming mail to.  If the file does not exist, MindVox assumes that you want
  to read your mail by logging into the system  and  going  to  your  mailbox.
  However,  in Unixland, there are many people who have more than one account,
  in fact there are a lot of people who have dozens of accounts all  over  the
  Internet  and cannot keep track of all their mail if it's scattered all over
  the world.  The answer to this problem is the use  of  FORWARD  files  which
  tell  mailers  to move all incoming mail into whatever mailbox the owner has
  selected.  The format for forward is simply the address  that  you  want  to
  send mail to.

     For example:  dell@vox.darkside.com

  Might be Thomas Dell's forward file.  This means that all the mail  sent  to
  "dell"  on  MindVox will in fact just pass through the MindVox mailer on its
  way to the Darkside.


  LOGIN     -

  MAILSIG   -

-- more --                   MailSig is a file that is appended to the end  of  your  private  correspon-
  dence.   It's  just  a  signature  file  that  is added when you are sending
  letters.  There is no rule regarding what can or cannot go into your mailsig
  file;  in  general though, anything beyond 4 lines is pushing it and getting
  somewhat obnoxious.  See also:  SIG

  PLAN      -

  Your Plan file is printed to a person's screen when  they  FINGER  your  ac-
  count.  It can be left empty, or filled with whatever information you desire
  to give out about yourself to the other Members  of  MindVox.   Some  people
  cannot  stay  serious  for more than a sentence or two, while others want to
  use this space to let people know something about who they are and what they
  do.   As with most things, there are no rules regarding what you can or can-
  not put into your Plan file, but we'd ask that you try not to fill it with a
  lot  of obscenities or control-codes that make people's terminals do strange
  things.  A lot of people don't deal well with this type of thing, and  while
  we  really  couldn't  care  less either way, if enough people complain about
  you, we'll do something really harsh like ask you to change it because other
  Members keep bugging us about you being naughty.

  SIG       -
-- more --                   Sig is your SIGnature file that gets appended to the end  of  whatever  mes-
  sages  you  post  in  the  Forums.  It too is a file that can be filled with
  whatever information you want to let the world know about you and your  sig-
  nature  choices, but we suggest keeping it to 4 lines or less.  As with most
  things, do what thou wilt.  See also:  MAILSIG


                            -=[> Other Commands <]=-
  HELP      -

  Help is sometimes helpful and sometimes a poorly-written collection of words
  and sentences and paragraphs and stuff that are composed at 4am right before
  the writer in question falls into a coma.  How helpful help  is  depends  on
  various variables, like how confused you are to begin with; how familiar you
  are with computers and networks; what your favorite color is; and  how  tall
  you are.  It is most helpful to read help files while highly intoxicated, or
  in the midst of any altered state.  This assures maximum assimilation of the
  materials  presented, and makes certain that you'll get an A on the quiz to-
  morrow.

   in the  world.  Since IRC is  carried by  InterNet,  the  world's  largest
   computer network, it reaches nearly every industrial  nation on the earth.
   It is not uncommon to enter a discussion spanning several continents while
   on IRC.
        
   To issue a command to IRC you must  use slash ("/") as a prefix.  Anything
   else is treated  a comment and  will be sent  to  the other users on  your
   channel.  Though there are over 100  commands available,  there are only a
   few that are necessary and important.  These are described below.
 
       /NAMES - Shows the names of each user currently logged into irc and
                which channels have been created.
 
       /NICK <nickname> - Your  nickname  starts  out  the  same  as  your
             mindvox  account name but  you may change  it to anything you
             please.  Keep in  mind that everyone on your channel  will be
             informed of the change.
 
-- more --                        /JOIN <channel> - A Channel  on IRC is  like a Channel  on your TV.
             JOIN allows  you move from  channel to  channel to  suit your
             prefence.  Channels  have names like  "#apple",  "#japan"  or
             "#hottub" depending  on what  is discussed  on them.  Join  a
             particular channel.  Please note that almost all channels are
             prefixed with a "#" (as in /JOIN #talk).
 
       /WHO <channel>  - List the  name of  everyone  on a  channel.
 
       /MSG <nickname> message - Send a private message to the the  person
            whose nickname  you specify.  No one else will be able to read
            the message.
 
   For more detailed information about  IRC's more advanced features you  may
   use the online "/HELP" Command.

[;H[2J
                         MindVox [HELP: MAIL] Reference

  The Mail system on MindVox allows you to communicate with almost anyone  who
  has  access  to a computer that is hooked into ANY network on earth.  If you
  wish to communicate with people who are NOT on the Internet, then we  recom-
  mend reading the MAIL GATEWAYS reference located in HELP.

  The Mail package is comprised of many smaller programs that figure out  what
  to  do with your letter depending on a variety of conditions.  The most com-
  mon use consists of sending a letter to another Member who is also on  Mind-
  Vox.  In this case your letter only travels from your mailbox to the intend-
  ed recipients -- it DOES NOT have to go out over the network.

  Although MAIL works from many different locations within  MindVox,  allowing
  you  to do such things as FORWARD interesting messages to other users, reply
  to messages that you have read in a Forum or Newsgroup, or  skip  the  menus
  and  MAIL SOMEONE@SOMEWHERE.SOMETHING from most prompts, most functions take
  place within the Mail area, using the commands described below.

  AGAIN     -

-- more --                   Again allows you to re-read the letter that you have just received.  It sim-
  ply means: "I want to read this letter AGAIN"  See also: VERBOSE

  BACK      -

  Go BACKwards and re-read the previous message.  If there is no previous mes-
  sage, BACK will act as AGAIN and re-read the current message.

  CLEAR     -

  Clears the screen (assuming you have told MindVox the proper  terminal  set-
  tings  in  the STATUS section of the central menu!)  It has no special func-
  tion other than clearing all text from your screen in case someone walks  in
  and you want your private correspondence to remain private.

  DELETE    -

  Delete is used to clear letters out of your mailbox that  you  have  already
  read,  and  don't  want  to  keep  around.  Typing "D" will mark the current
  letter for removal.  If you have accidentally deleted a letter that you want
  to  keep,  then  typing  "D" once more, will un-delete it!  In effect Delete
  toggles the deleted/un-deleted status of a letter.
-- more --                   You can also specify the number of a letter you want to remove.

     For example:  Next/25> D 14

  Would delete letter number 14 from the active mailbox.

  DOWNLOAD  -

  Download is used to download the current letter with whatever  protocol  you
  have  selected in STATUS (X, Y, Z modem, or Kermit).  Normally you would not
  want to download short messages, because its not worth  the  hassle  if  you
  just  want  to  read  a  few  paragraphs.   However,  many  people belong to
  mailing-lists or receive electronic journals or digests through the mail and
  these  can  be quite lengthy.  The download feature is implemented primarily
  for this purpose (although there is nothing stopping you  for  using  it  to
  download every letter that comes your way.  That's up to you.)

     For example:  Next/25> DOWNLOAD

     Would give you the status message:

-- more --                                    [Download #25 via Z-modem protocol?]: Y(es)

                   [17  blocks, 3k, with Z-modem active]

  At which point you would want to put your terminal program  into its receive
  mode (whatever that happens to be for your specific set-up).

  EXPAND    -

  Expands mailing lists.  This command prints a listing of the names you  have
  contained in a particular mailing list.

     For example:  EXPAND 3stooges

     Could give you the listing: larry curly moe

  FOLLOW    -

  This command allows you to FOLLOW-up on a message or letter, including quot-
  ed text within your reply.  This can help a great deal if you need to estab-
  lish context.  MANY messages travel strange and arduous routes  before  set-
  tling into a Newsgroup or mailing-list, and if you send mail to someone ask-
-- more --                   ing about some message they posted last month . . . they might have no  idea
  what  you're  talking  about  if you don't include a piece of the message to
  remind them!

     For example:  Next/25> FOLLOW

  Although FOLLOW assumes that the intended recipient is also  the  author  of
  the message or letter, an address other than that of the original sender can
  be specified.  For example you may want to comment  on  something  you  have
  just  seen posted somewhere and send along an example of what you're talking
  about.

  For example: Next/25> FOLLOW eric@clapton.com  Would allow  you  to  include
  quotes  from letter #25 to eric, even if message #25 wasn't from eric.  Mul-
  tiple addresses can also be specified.

  For example:  Next/25> FOLLOW eric@clapton.com, tuc, dave@hamster.org  Would
  send   mail  to  eric  and  dave  at  the  Internet  sites  clapton.com  and
  hamster.org, respectively, and to the MindVox Member named Tuc.   See  also:
  FORWARD, REPLY, SEND

  FORWARD   -
-- more --                   Forward works in a way that is similar to FOLLOW but instead of allowing the
  insertion  of  quoted  text  into the body of your letter, it simply sends a
  verbatim copy of the message or letter to the recipient(s) you want to  send
  copies to.  Forward the mail command has NOTHING to do with FORWARD files in
  the HOME section of MindVox.  See also:  FOLLOW, REPLY, SEND

  GO        -

  This command allows you to move between the various MAIL  FOLDERS  that  you
  have set up to store different types of mail.  How you choose to set-up your
  folders is an individual matter, although the two choices that  seem  to  be
  most  prevalent  are  grouping mail by name or date.  Whatever your personal
  preferences are, GO allows you to move from folder to folder, with  the  de-
  fault  being  MAILBOX,  which  is the "active" folder where all your MindVox
  mail ends up in before you decide to move it to another folder.

     For example: GO

     Current folder is: mailbox

     Folder      Letters    Bytes      Last modified
-- more --                      ----------  ---------  ---------  ---------------------
     MAILBOX       1442      3882384      14-Aug-92 02:02
     LOVE            10        92012      11-Jun-92 14:19
     SPAM             3         1402      20-Jan-92 00:09
     EUGENE          19        10982      22-Aug-92 09:14

     Enter folder name or RETURN to resume: love

  "GO LOVE" will do the same thing, but omits the menu.  Folders are automati-
  cally created by using the MOVE command.  See also:  MOVE

  HELP      -

  You're reading it!  See also:  THERAPY

  LIST      -

  Prints the date that a letter was received, along with who sent it to you.

     For example:  Next/25> LIST

        1   19 Aug 92 - cthulhu (Salvador Dali-Lama)
-- more --                         2   19 Aug 92 - falconer (Steve Copold)
        3   19 Aug 92 - system@mindvox.phantom.com (System Administrator)
        4   19 Aug 92 - sbranch (Kim Clancy)
        5   19 Aug 92 - hotblack (Dana Watanabe)
        6   19 Aug 92 - charles (charles platt)
        7   19 Aug 92 - chrmsync (Chrome Sync)
        8   19 Aug 92 - siva (Stu Klingman)
        9   19 Aug 92 - bwp (Jane Doe)
       10   19 Aug 92 - ahawks (Andy)
       11   19 Aug 92 - cudigest (Jim Thomas)
       12   19 Aug 92 - terminus (Len Rose)
       13   19 Aug 92 - pclip (Paper Clip)

  LIST can also be used with the arguments  SUBJECT  and  ORGANIZATION,  which
  causes  list  to  print  letters by their subjects, or originating organiza-
  tions, depending on which one you have selected.  For example: LIST SUBJECT.
  List  always  defaults to AUTHOR.  To abort a very long listing, you can use
  ^C (control-C).

  MOVE      -

  The MOVE command allows you to move the current letter  to  another  Folder.
-- more --                   If  the  Folder you want to access does not presently exist, MindVox creates
  the Folder and then moves your message.

  For example: Next/19> move JULY  Would move the  current  message  into  the
  Folder  named  July.  If July didn't already exist, it would now be created.
  If you don't specify a Folder, then MOVE will place you in the GO menu where
  you can select a Folder to MOVE to.  See also:  GO

  NEXT      -

  Does the same thing as pressing [return] which is what most people do.  N is
  a holdover for those who are so used to Unix-style syntax that they automat-
  ically hit the "n" key every time they want to move forward in a program.

  QUIT      -

  Exit the MindVox Mail system.  If you have  messages  marked  for  deletion,
  they  are  removed at this time and no longer recoverable.  If you have mail
  still sitting in your mailbox that has already been read, MindVox  asks  you
  if you wish to remove it at this time, if you do then answering "Y(es)" will
  delete all the read mail from your mailbox.   Hitting  [return],  "N(o)"  or
  pressing any other key, will leave your mail alone.
-- more --                   REPLY     -

  Is used to reply to a message or letter you have read.  It will  retain  the
  Subject:  line  of  the message you are responding to with a "Re:" placed in
  front.  For example:  Subject: Re: Cooking with Spam & Lox?  See also:  FOL-
  LOW, FORWARD, SEND

  SEND      -

  Send a letter.  Tells MindVox that you want to send a new letter.

     For example: Next/19> send phantom@mindvox.phantom.com

  Will send a letter to Phantom on the MindVox system.  Since  you're  already
  on the MindVox site if you're reading this, you can just type:  send phantom
  and get the same result.  See also:  FOLLOW, FORWARD, REPLY

  VERBOSE   -

  Puts the mailer into verbose mode.  This means it will spit out  ALL  header
  information  which  you  normally  don't see.  This is useful if you want to
-- more --                   trace the paths a letter travelled to arrive in your MindVox  mailbox.   You
  would  usually only want to use this feature if you are tracking Internet or
  Usenet mail.  See also:  AGAIN

  WRITE     -

  Write will save the current letter or message into   a  file  in  your  HOME
  directory.   If the file already exists, then the current letter will be ap-
  pended to the file.

     For example:   Next/19> write

                 [Appended to file /member/mailbox]

  Would append the current message to the end of your mailbox.  You  can  also
  specify a filename, for example:  Next/19> write cars.forsale

                 [Written to file: /member/cars.forsale]

  As you may or may not have noticed, all text that pertains to  your  account
  ends  up  in  your HOME directory in one form or another.  You can load your
  mail into editors, send it to other places, or sort it  all  out  using  the
-- more --                   tools  provided in your HOME area.  You can also MAIL files that you edit or
  download from that section, or WRITE from the Forums or Newsgroups.

  If you want more information on sending mail to other networks, the GATEWAYS
  file in the HELP section of MindVox will provide additional information.  If
  you want to become an absolute expert, we would recommend reading ZEN &  THE
  ART  OF  THE  INTERNET  which  is  available  online  in  the ARCHIVES area:
  (Cyberspace/Internet)

  As always if you are having any difficulties, please use  FEEDBACK  or  send
  mail to "support" and we will provide whatever assistance you require!
