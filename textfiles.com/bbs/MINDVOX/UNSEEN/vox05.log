A Complete list of available Forums  can be displayed with the INDEX command.
If you know the full name  of the forum you wish to go to you may enter it by
typing it's  name (ie: "Go  Introductions").  To search for  a pattern, add a
slash to the beginning of the name.  For instance, "go /puter" would take you
to Computers:Amiga, the first  Forum with the word Computers  in the name.  If
you wish to continue a search you may do so  by simply typing "Go /" again. In
In the above case this would take you to Computers:Apple.  Note that to return
to Computers:Amiga, you can simply type "Go Amiga" 


Go to Forum: 
That is not a valid Forum.  Type INDEX for a list.

        The archives do seem a bit bare for practical usage right now. 
Are there any plans to integrate a WAIS client or similar network 
anonymous file grabber?
        Also, what kinds of wacky things are in demand? If each of us 
knew what the others were looking for, we could help eachother out.
perhaps that would be a good start for this forum?

I'd like to see any cracking tech journals for the Amiga or PC or even the
Mac series, anything new or interesting out there, I lost touch about 6 or
7 months ago and missed the new installments.  Nothing illegal just
protection schemes discussed and things like that!

I am interested primarily in developing sources of law and good thinking 
for civil rights, particularly employment discrimination lawyers, 
worldwide to help us here. Am going to try to look into ways to use 
Gophers on the Internet to find sources, including on line cases from the 
US Supreme Court readily available to civil rights types who cannot 
afford the outrageous bills on Lexis and Westlaw. Most of the stuff 
needed is in public domain anyway. It will put the disadvantaged on a 
much more even keel with the big guys. the fact that it uses the same 
dollars the defense dept. and others use to screw them makes it even more 
environmentally Sherwood Forest.

A single-source legal data base is a great idea. If you have a site to
set up ftp access, there are a number of ways to develop the data base from
the many fairly specialized sites alread in existence..

Having spent a few hours digging through really ancient Apple dos 3.3 and
some real live 3.2 (13 sectors and ALMOST A FULL WHOPPING 110K per disk!)
disks, I've found heaping giant piles of STUFF that I forgot ever
existed...  we've got about... 100-120 b0rdZ (like the programs that ran
various things, kinda meaningless, but interesting to flip through the
userlists and menus), hundreds of weird wareZ that make the APple-Cat go
<BeeP> <B0oP> <b()P> [KP] Beep Ker-Chink! [ST], um.... the grand
formations of 'bout 50 groups, including KOS, LOD, uhmmm.....  gee, there
is a lot of stuff here all right, someone should probably go through all
of it someday.... .. . . . . . . . the collected works of the TwiLigHT
yeARZ and the VirUS WaRZ throughout Apple-Land where CyberAIDS and
Festering Hate devoured gigZ of the h0ttest, gnuesT, latest, and went
<burp> with a happy sound...  whoa.... we have GEA (Got 'Em All) the 12
sided saga of the fall of Adventurers Tavern and the decline of ELITE
PirACy, ummmm.....  man, it's a downer that things that look
breathtakingly byooteefull and resplendant in all their 40 column
-- more (73%) --                 UPPERCASE GLORY fail to translate to a 1280x1100 workstation where they
look like shit....  oh well... 

So's the question is... what do you guys want MOST online RIGHT NOW,
because this is gonna be happenin for... a REAL LONG TIME, even
null-modemed at 19200 which is as fast as an Apple will g0.

I... I think I'm gonna go do something important like play Dino Eggs  yeah
that's what I'm gonna d() allright...

Holy Shit!  

Just looked through some of the History files, all of its in there, or
most of it is building up at least! I had no idea there was so much stuff,
I thought CUD had cataloged most of it, but as it stands right now at
least double of what CUD ever had is in history, how much more is there??
-- more (72%) --                 Requests: All of the Book of PAT, there is like less then 50% right now I
think, the Mark Tabas Better Homes & Blue Boxing Files, if you have them
the Kracowicz Kracking Korner series, there were about 30 I think, you
have the KKK directory going, do you have all of those?

Deadboy, the BH&BH files (as well as every other major blue box phile ever
written) are located in Archives/Cyberspace/History/Phreaking/Blue-Boxing.
Basically, EVERY MAJOR text phile is either already on the Vox or will be
-- more (56%) --                 soon.  The problem is that it's hard to find anything in the Archives
because they are so huge. For instance, there is a directory somewhere
outside the History directory that has all the colored box philes, and yet
the Blue Box philes are in the directory mentioned at the beginning of
this paragraph.  I don't mind this so much, in fact the bigger the
Archives the better, but I just wish someone had enough sense to either
hire a full-time archive master (a trained librarian), or better yet, did
an "ls -lR" on the entire Archives and stored it in a text file so people
can download it and find what they need, and then go directly to those
directories and leech the kewlin' philes.  On the other hand, it just
might be easier to fix or make work the Find command so that this would not
be necessary.

debut by Omega, sysop of Moody Loners With Handguns BBS and author of a tech

gripping tale of political intrigue and space aliens.  "Mr. President, you're
NOT on Candid Camera."

While searching the archives here, I have stumbled on to what may be the
most disgusting, offensive, yet funny, group of text philes.  These are
the files written by members of the Neon Knights.. 

The philes are located in:

/Archives/Cyberspace/History/Anarchy/Neon-Knights


My favorite gem is "how2party", but the other files are equally disgusting
and offensive.  If you're into this kinda stuff, these philes are well
worth reading.  Kind of reminds me of cDc except maybe the Neon Knights
took too much angel dust and went to too many KKK meetings.  Thier
attitude towards women is truly offensive...  I am glad someone had the
sense to save these files.

The one thing I must warn you about is not to take these philes too
-- more (87%) --                 seriously or get too offended, because they were written by drunken 13-15
year old redneck wares kids.

Actually, the t-group Toxic Shock took after the Neon Knights more.  TS 
put out about a hundred sex/Satan/slaughter files before their leader 
flipped out and the group broke up.

Yeah, them cDc files are c-ool. And the TS files kicks ass. Anyone
out there who knows where once could find ALL TS files? I seem to
have missed a few of them which I can't find anywhere!

Question:   Is that the Anarchy, Inc. which was based on the
West Coast?   I'd heard there were a couple of the them.

Then this is the same group of folks that I know.  

I'm a frequent caller of what could be called (since it no longer
exists) homeBase for Anarchy, Inc. -- Dark Side (408-245-SPAM) --
and I was looking for some of their files, but it seems they've
been removed from public consumption.  When questioned concerning
this, I believe their response was, "I was fucking 15, dammit!"

I thought many of those files were a hoot.

w0w... I've got a mess of their files but I doubt it's all of 'em.  Does 
anyone have ALL of them for sure?  They weren't numbered so it's hard to 
tell.

The funniest thing was the "Urine Box Plans" which was supposed to melt

exist.  From time to time you'll still see somebody posting, looking for 
the parts.

I, too, have quite an archive of Anarchy, Inc files -- I'll talk

there is a BBS in Chicago which has them all -- will check.

"general" I believe, but they are on an old Everex 20 meg hard drive 
which does not seem to want to work any more...maybe I'll find someone

Well, If you have already paid for it (INTERNET ACCESS), just contact the 
systen Adm. and tell him or her to activate your telnet. as far as FTP is 
concerned, they told me that it is off untill mindvox is done moving to 
its new location.....

Does anyone know when FTP will be re-enabled? My messages to feedback 
have gone unanswered...I guess it's the transition. Anyway, once it's 
re-enabled, how will I engage FTP?

have i had problems connecting but this is so slow that i want to pull my
fingers off and chew on them*and by the thyme ths shows up on the screen,
iprobobly will have( because then i will actually see the results of what
i'm doing with my fingers and i can taste the blood which would be better
than not being sure if they really exist because after all theya re not
making anything appear on the screen. granted im oly calling at 1400
still, but cummon i could deal with the connection before this is
rediculous and nothing has appeared on y screen past the first line STILL
and it is makng me sick. i love this place i sure wouldn't want to ave to
come toit like this all the time because then, no matter how much fin i
have here, i may have to quit coming.

and 1400 should say 2400.

I'm pretty sure ZMODEM worked on a binary file before the 
new modems showed up.  Now when I try a binary file I get
"CRC Error".  Everything seems to work hunky-dorey on a 
text file.  Anybody have any ideas?

i got modplay (finally) but now dont know which files are mods!! pkk 
please tell us!(me)  i am real innerested in hearing some.

also of note: my first piece of freeware! its called reader.zip andits 
g|~00v`/ d00d! actually it aint much--its a text file reader that 
displays a page by "fade in"---random characters are placed until the 
page is full. it looks kinda neat. as a bonus you can read REALLY LARGE 
FILES (it reads as much as it can and swaps unlike Edit which just GIVES 
UP!!!BLAH!!!). like i sed its my first real program. and im just SO 
proud! =) (twinkle)......so GET IT! you wont be (too) sorry.

Read news, there's some kind of problem with some of them that is being
fixed. the upload download that is, logging in there isn't one.

you need to use ftpmail until ftp is on which is within the next 10 days,
for some reason fsp is supposed to be on first, I don't know why that is,
but thats fine with me since the wares I want are all on fsp sites ;-)

Most of you guys seem to be 14.4ing into Mindvox. What about us  who are
coming via Internet (Telnet)? Maybe I'm being silly, but how do I download
the archive stuff?

I'm used to FTPing stuff at various sites to my local machine - is Mindvox
available as an FTP source (obviously not ANONYMOUSly).

Well, there are two options:

1) You can download over a telnet connection, provided you tell your
   telnet client to set binary mode on.  With this option, you would
   be able to use Zmodem to download a file from Mindvox directly
   to your PC or Mac which is connected to your local Unix site.

2) If you want to transfer stuff from Mindvox to your local Unix
-- more (64%) --                    site, type "ftp" on mindvox, and ftp back into your site
   log in as you (NOT anonymous) and use your regular Unix
   password for the password, and then "put" files from your
   home directory in Mindvox to your home directory on your Unix
   site.


I don't think that Mindvox will actually become an anonymous ftp site for
members.  By it's very nature anonymous means that anybody from the Internet
would be able to access stuff.  Method 2 is a much better solution.

$0$0$0$0$0$0$0$0 CHEAP TRUTH ONE $0$0$0$0$0$0$0$0EDITORIAL:  Hi.  You want to know the truth.  We want to tell it to you.Let's try to keep the ECONOMICS between us to a minimum, okay?  Right, let'sdo it.**  QUEST FOR DECAY  **        As American SF lies in a reptilian torpor, its small, squishy cousin,Fantasy, creeps gecko-like across the bookstands.  Dreaming of dragon-hood,Fantasy has puffed itself up with air like a Mojave chuckwalla.  SF'scollapse had formed a vacuum that forces Fantasy into a painful and explosivebloat.        Short stories, crippled with the bends, expand into whole hideoustrilogies as hollow as nickel gumballs.  Even poor Stephen Donaldson, whostruggles to atone for his literary crimes with wet hippy sincerity, has beenforced to re-xerox his Tolkien pastiches and doubly insult the public.  AsRobert E. Howard spins in his grave, the Chryslers of publishing attachrotors to his head and feet and use him to power the presses.        But the editors have eaten sour grapes and the writers' teeth are on-- more --                 edge.  Fantasy, for too long the vapid playground of McCaffreyiteunicorn-cuddlers and insect-eating SCA freaks, has some new and dangerousborderlands.  Suddenly, perhaps out of sheer frustration, fantasy hasmovement and color again.  It is the squirming movement of corruption and thebright sheen of decay.**  Some Examples **        NIFFT THE LEAN by Michael Shea.  DAW, $2.95.  Jack Vance's acolyte,author of the apprentice work QUEST FOR SIMBILIS, Shea has suddenly andfearsomely come into his own.  This astonishing work shows a furiousimaginative concentration that is impressive and even appalling.  Thelegitimate heir of Vance, Leiber, and Clark Ashton Smith, Shea rips aside thepolite, smirking ironies of these polished writers and shows us a crawling,boiling vision of the demonic.  He is a Fender Stratocaster to Vance'sStradivarius.        For those familiar with Vance's work, the effect is odd anddisquieting, like seeing a favorite uncle stumble in, blasted on bad acid andmumbling cosmis obscenities.  There are supernatural horrors here that makeCthulhu and his boys look as tame as pinstriped bankers.  Hell itself, itsdenizens and environs, are captured with a revolting nicety of detail and-- more --                 Current Directory: [Archives/Cyberpunk/Journals/CheapTruth]

                                   EDIBORIAL

This was supposed to be a simple letter to the Scream Baby subscribers.

Hi!  I'm going to Yew*stun for Xmas Con this weekend...
Let's do launch if our spheres collide;
                                       was all this needed to be.

Maybe toss in an interesting line noise or two.

Perhaps a brief eulogy for my friend Sandeep.  Seems he was hiking in New
Mexico and was excited about seeing snow for the fourth time in his life.
[Sandeep was from India]  He ran ahead of his group, got separated, got lost,
-- more --                 and died of hypothermia that night.

To put it in perspective, re:alize that Sandeep contracted a rare neurological
disorder six months ago.  He woke up not being able to feel or move his legs,
the victim of a mystery-to-medicine.  Being in New Mexico was a celebration of
months of successful rehabilitation.

People die every day.

You will die someday soon                          sorry to spoil the secret.

But dying out of excitement to explore the universe......it could be worse.
Walk it like ya talk it.  Thanx for the lesson, Sandeep.

                      THE JOURNAL OF IMAGINATIVE TROUBLE

Talking Raven : The Journal of Imaginative Trouble Vol II, #1 Summer Solstice
1992.  Distributed free on the streets of Seattle.  By snailmail $2 USD in
America, $5 USD anyplace else.

The theme of this issue is "Virtual Reality : Close But No Cigar." Editor
Antero Alli claims this to be "our cyberpunk satire, a rebellion against
those simulated realities and media illusions which....fail to move the
imagination."

If satire is what Talking Raven sought, then consider this issue a miserable
failure.  This satire issue is super-charged concentrate; Antero Alli's
writings reveal a Prime A Grade Cyberpunk.

"From the Editor's Monitor" rants about virtual reality (more on that later)
and ends with an advocation to "Turn off the TV and make your own movies"

People seizing methods of producing mass media for themselves?  A call to
"turn off the TV and make your own movies....shoot the news or make the
news....but get out there and DO SOMETHING"?
-- more --                                              Nope, not cyberpunk!

Another article explores the connections between advertising and black
magic(k).  Sean Kilpatrick explains how television commercials use the same
methods that Aleister Crowley's espoused concerning the shaping of Will
(re:ality).  Antero Alli pops up again with an essay on "How To See Through
Advertising"

Television as a major form of thought control?  Arming the viewer with
knowledge in order to defend against the influence of advertising?

                             Nope, not cyberpunk!

The re-structuring of economic value from product to information?

                             Nope, not cyberpunk!


This isn't a satire; this is pure, unexpurgated cyberpunk.  It ain't perfect,
just damn interesting.

-- more --                 The knock against virtual reality essentially claims that VR ain't cyberpunk
*enough*.  One of the identifying characteristics of New Edge technology is
individual personal control.  How many of you can program a virtual reality
environment?  How many of you think you'll be able to do so in less than 20
years?

Not I.

Sure, nickel and dime stuff, but there is such a wide chasm between
possibility and plausibility that I'll look for other ledges to leap.  For all
the rhetoric on individual emancipation, for all the rhetoric on DIY, 99% of
the population will be plugging in pre-prepared Babbage's bubble shrink wrap
slag.

A rail against the commodification of cyberspace?

                             Nope, not cyberpunk!

                        |____________________________|

The history of humanity is the clan/family.  Individuals had little
contact with other realities -- and cultural exchange was more likely to
involve weapons of destruction than literature when one walked into the walls
of a different reality tunnel.

Today we are flooded.

Not satisfied with a single perspective, thought, belief, and culture,
communication technology strives to represent the realities of every single
human on the planet.  No corner of the globe too distant to explore, no ugly
seam at home too disturbing to ignore.

WELCOME to the first issue of CYBERSPACE VANGUARD!
 
Despite the name, CV is NOT a magazine about or in any way
related to cyberpunk.  We chose the name simply because
"cyberspace" is quickly becoming the 90's word for the world
of electronic communications.  CV will cover pretty much
anything that's of interest to the science fiction community,
regardless of what it is.  We're open to submissions from
anyone, regardless of experience.  The writing is judged
SOLELY on its quality.
 
For writers' guidelines, write to cn577@cleveland.freenet.edu
or, for those of you who prefer to communicate on paper, you
can write to us at:
 
                         Cyberspace Vanguard
                         PO Box 25704

                         USA
 
But enough about that.  This month we've brought you
interviews with Jeff Kaake of Space Rangers, Peter Donat of
the upcoming show TIME TRAX, J. Michael Straczynski, creator
of BABYLON 5, and Eric Radomski, producer of BATMAN: THE
ANIMATED SERIES.  (What can we say, it's a big month for TV!) 
We've also brought you, in the words of one of our readers,
"more news than hours of net surfing."
 
All this is just the beginning.  We need YOUR input to help
make Cyberspace Vanguard THE source of SF news.  Tell us what
you like about it, what you hate about it, but most of all,
what you think would improve it.  So that we don't wind up
with scores of copies of the magazine inadvertently quoted
back to our mailbox, we've posted an electronic reply card
immediately after this post.
 
Oh, and a note to other editors:  CV is registered with the
United States Copyright Office.  We don't mind you quoting
us, but we must insist on credit being given.  All rights

-- more --                 This article will focus mainly on cyberpunk culture, rave culture, industrial,
post po-mo, virtual reality, drugs, computer underground, etc. Basically, the
elements that make up the developing techno-underground, the new edge,
the technoculture.

Included in this article will be: suggested readings -- books, magazines,
zines, requisite authors, etc., BBSes devoted to relevant topics, corporations
and merchandise geared toward the techno-aware, Internet e-mail addresses for
relevant figure-heads in this area, suggested music and movies/videos, FTP
sites, etc. 

I will do my best to update this article every so often, as the
techno-underground is not stagnant and is always shifting and changing and
moving forward.  If you have any complaints/comments/suggestions/errors or just
wanna send someone mail, write to me on the Internet - ahawks@nyx.cs.du.edu.  I
also welcome addition requests and such - feel free to say "hey man, add
blah-blah to the list!"

Agrippa: A Book of the Dead - A collaboration between author [William
     Gibson], publisher Kevin Begos Jr, and artist Dennis Ashbaugh.  
     This art-work contains engravings by Ashbaugh which appear or 
     disappear in light and an on-disk semi-autobiographical poem by 
     [William Gibson] which is unreadable after having been read once.  
     Agrippa is notable because in many respects it blurs the lines 
     about what art is, and adds fuel to the fire on issues of property 
     rights and intellectual property.

BBSes - electronic Bulletin Board Systems.  Begun in the late 70's, a
        form of [virtual community] existing in [cyberspace] where
        participants (usually using aliases) may send and receive
        public and private messages to each other on any topic
        imaginable, transfer software (copyrighted and/or public
-- more --                         domain), play on-line games, etc.  There is the "over-ground"
        BBS world where aliases are less common and illegal activities
        are avoided in discussion, and the [{computer} underground]
        where illegal activities and discussions are very common,
        members use aliases, and illegal information and/or software
        is exchanged.
 
Boxing - A variety of electronic devices used to aid in [phreaking].
        The original was the blue box, used from the mid 60's to the
        mid 80's, which allowed long distance phone calls to be made
        for free.  A variety of other similar instruments
        accomplishing different tasks have been developed, some
        purely comical, some quite practical.
 
CC fraud - Credit Card or Calling Card fraud.  common in the
        [computer underground] community.
 
Chaos Theory - science revolving around simplistic equations
        involving a large number of variables.  Gave rise to
        [fractals], a form of [cyberdelic] art.  For further info on
        the subject, James Gleick's "Chaos: Making a New Science" is
        suggested.
-- more --                  
Computer Underground - "A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind
        aliases, to promote the free exchange of information
        regarding anything and everything including, but not limited
        to: computers, telephones, radios, chemicals, and ideas."
        (thanx to The Butler for this definition)
        The mainstay of communication for the computer underground is
        [cyberspace], more specifically [BBSes].  The computer
        underground is comprised of [hackers], [phreakers],
        [piraters], anarchists, and other [cyberpunks].
 
CP - see [cyberpunk].
 
Cryonics - The fringe science of freezing a person's head or whole
        body after death, in the hopes that in the future they may be
        revived and brought back to life.
 
Cyber- - A prefix taken from [cybernetics] generally used in popular
        culture to mean anything that is technologically oriented.
 
Cyberdeck - Term originated by [William Gibson] to refer to a
        computer used by [deck cowboys] that can connect to the
-- more --                         [matrix].
 
Cyberdelic - "Cyber-art".  Examples include [fractals],
        computer-generated pictures and/or music, [virtual worlds],
        etc.
 
Cybernetics - The study of communication systems in living organisms
        and machines, the mathematical analysis of the flow of
        information.
 
Cyberpunk - Begun as a literary movement in the 80's, an off-shoot of
        normal science fiction.  Unique in that it generally occurs
        in the present or not so distant future, the characters are
        often considered "punks" and technology, (the cyber aspect), is
        prominent.  "Neuromancer" by [William Gibson], published in
        1984, is considered by most to be the "bible" of cyberpunk.
        Another prominent author is [Bruce Sterling], editor of
        another worthy cyberpunk collection, "Mirrorshades".
        Other examples  of cyberpunk include Max Headroom (tv
        show) and Blade Runner  (movie).  Cyberpunk is
        special in that it has evolved from a purely literary
        movement to a realistic subculture.  Many "techno-punks"
-- more --                         (ie: [hackers]) are considered cyberpunks.  Other
        contributing factors to the cyberpunk subculture
        include:  virtual reality, hallucinogenic and [nootropic]
        drugs, and industrial and punk music.  For an in-depth,
        detailed look at cyberpunk fiction and cyberpunk culture,
        "Storming the Reality Studio", ed. by Larry McCaffery is
        suggested.
 
Cyberspace - "The electronic frontier." A completely virtual
        environment: the sum total of all [BBSes], computer networks,
        and other [virtual communities].  Unique in that it is
        constantly being changed, exists only virtually, can be
        practically infinite in "size", communication occurs
        instantaneously world-wide - physical location is completely
        irrelevant most of the time.
 
Deck Cowboys - Futuristic version of a computer [hacker] or a
        modern-day [cyberpunk].
 
Electronic Frontier Foundation - (EFF).  Organization founded by
        Mitch Kapor (of Lotus fame) and John Perry Barlow (writer and
        Grateful Dead songwriter) to establish laws for [cyberspace]
-- more --                         and apply the constitution to [virtual communities].
 
Fractals - Images created using [chaos theory].  A mish-mash of
        colors presented in a pattern that repeats itself many times
        over.  A popular type of fractal image is one created using
        the "Mandlebrot set".  Fractals are considered [cyberdelic]
        art.
 
Gibson, William - Considered by most to be the "father" of
        [cyberpunk], along with [Bruce Sterling].  His works include
        the infamous "Neuromancer", "Count Zero", "Mona Lisa
        Overdrive" (these 3 works are known as the [sprawl] series),
        "The Difference Engine" with which he was co-author with [Bruce
        Sterling], and "Burning Chrome" a collection of short
        stories.  Hist latest work is a poem in "[Agrippa: A Book of the
        Dead]".  Gibson says he will no longer be writing the "classic"
        [cyberpunk] novels he is famous for.
 
Hacker - 60's (1st) generation (orig. MIT):  one who tinkers with
        software, electronics, computer hardware, etc.  80's (2nd)
        [WarGames] generation:  one who enters computer systems
        without permission with either malicious or non-malicious
-- more --                         intent, to gain, alter, or destroy information (labelled as
        [crackers] by the 60's generation).  90's (3rd) generation:
        often called [cyberpunks], mostly non-malicious [crackers]
        interested in information for the sake of information, and
        not hacking for the sake of the hack - sometimes calling
        themselves "information liberators", they have re-adopted
        more of the original hacker ethic of the 60's which states
        mainly "all information should be free", "access to computers
        should be unlimited and total" and "promote
        decentralization".   This new, 3rd generation is commonly
        associated with the computer underground, despite its mostly
        non-malicious intent.
 
Industrial - A subculture revolving around industrial music, a
        collection of mostly electronically created sounds and
        samples that results in a fierce explosion of sound labelled
        by many as "the new punk".  This subculture is generally
        anti-political, anti-aesthetic in nature.
 
Internet - A large and very popular world-wide computer network
        begun by the Defense Department in the 60's that connects
        educational institutions, corporations, organizations, and

(music is music and you like what you like, but here is a list of trippy or
futuristic oriented groups.....Undoubtedly you will argue with my
categorizations and selections, but each person has their own tastes and
preferences and opinions, so please don't make a big deal out of it...
Obviously this list is by no means definitive - that truly would be impossible,
but it should be enough to get you started in the right directions....)

        -nausea likely
        -similar to LSD with less visual effects, 6-8 hrs.
LSD
        -lysergic acid diethylamide-25, acid, cid, sid, lucy in the sky, 
         sugarcubes, blotter, tabs, microdots, windowpaine, etc. etc.
        -causes hallucinations, altering/distortion of vision, auditory, time,
         enhancement of sensations, motor difficulties, loss of concentration
         or consistent thought, pupil dilation (or opposite)

      you  are and who you're with) have a _lot_ to do with the outcome of
      what LSD  does.  First time trippers should trip only with people they
      trust that  have tripped before, and in a place where unexpected "bad"
      things will not  happen (police come in, parents, etc).  Tim Leary has
      lots of info on  what could be done.  Reading his books can only help.

        -effects: trip-like but less hallucinogenic than lsd, 6 hours, 
         less intense
MDMA

        -empathenogen

Following is the document I promised a while back on the system I am
developing. I have received many requests for this data so here it is
(a little incomplete or it never would have been posted). I'm emailing
copies to those who requested it and will be in touch with programmers
who said they were interested (see later).

THIS DOCUMENT

This document is an overview of ideas and concepts that have evolved
over the last year or so. It is not meant to comprehensive, exhaustive,
complete or fixed. Any items mentioned herein are open for discussion
and modification through arbitration (ie if you've got a good idea, tell
me and we'll use it!). Criticism is most wellcome as this has chiefly
been only a two person project with various input from 1/2 dozen others.
Arguments and pointers from others would be gratefully received.

The first part of this document discusses some broad ideas and then
-- more --                 gives a brief description of the terms used. Following this is a 1/2
technical discussion on a walk though of some aspects of the system.
After that a more detailed examination is made of the various terms
described briefly earlier and finally a look at other, less related
topics is covered in cursory fashion.

After all that a brief description of the software as it stands is
given, along with projected milestones and pleas for
technical/programming assistance.

This document mentions many ideas and concepts that stem from the use
and implementation of the underlying protocols. This paper discusses
broad uses of the protocols and the resulting system rather than
focusing on the protocol itself. The reason for this is two-fold:

  1) The protocol by itself would seem pretty meaningless without 
     describing how it works and how its resulting use affects the 
     dynamics of a system, and 
     
  2) The protocol isn't firmly set. As the system is developed, more 
     holes are found and things change. There are 1 dozen or so basic 
     messages and a dozen or so rules that are followed, but these are in flux.
-- more --                 It is hoped that this paper will give readers some familiarity with the
type of system that is beeing aimed for. A later paper, covering the
nitty gritty may be produced, but the detailed explanations may be left
to the source code itself when it is released. 

Having read this discussion first, users and programmers will be in a 
better position to criticise and aid in the systems development (by 
discussion and programming support).

Note: Where possible I have put terms in capitals which refer to 
concepts/objects whichare peculiar to this system. This is to try to 
differentiate items when using English to describe some ideas etc, to 
make things a bit clearer.



SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The need for a low cost, low bandwidth cyberterminal (CYBERTERM) has 
arisen due to the increasing need to communicate over existing data 
channels with existing hardware. The system is aimed for widespread use 
-- more --                 over a number of platforms and data connections. Initial release is planned 
for late '92 in a shareware format with full source code for all available 
systems.



INTERFACE

The interface is simply using the screen with the keyboard and mouse to 
provide a window view into a cyberspace area. As source code will become 
available. 

The addition of Power Glove, HMD and other devices will be 
encouraged but not initally supported and will not be required. 

The nature of the system will be such that if you have a PC XT with 
hercules graphics then you can display only wire frame at 1 frame per 
second (or whatever the software can manage). If you have an Indigo or 
similar then you are lucky enough to be able to display 30 frames a second,
solid or rendered. The idea is that all the different systems will be able to be
functionally connected together in a meaningful manner. If you have a full 
body suit, lucky you and you get better integration into the cyberspace etc etc 
-- more --                 etc.

What this all means is that the code has a central communications core that is 
common to all modules on all systems. The interface business is merely a 
variable front end. All systems will use the same messages etc to 
communicate, but the low end users' systems will not request the extra data and 
will not be capable of producing some messages. 
(eg if you don't have a mouse then movenment is via keyboard. If you have a 
Data Glove then movement can be via gestures).



INITIAL SYSTEM

The system will initially be designed around a PC, with Amiga and X11 (on a 
Sun IPC) mods being made as we go, but with no special provisos for these 
machines at this point. Software is currently being written and a beta version 
will be available in a few months (now is May '92). Release will be via 
request to selected users for immediate feedback, followed by general 
shareware release.


-- more --                 SYSTEM ARCHITECHETURE

The whole nature of the cyberspace is controlled by the messages that are 
sent, which abstractly define the rules for objects, clients etc within the 
cyberspace. To more clearly describe the nature of these rules and 
messages, a number of terms have been borrowed and coined to describe 
new/borrowed concepts. Once these terms are defined, then it becomes 
much clearer as to how the whole thing fits together and the interaction of 
objects and the nature of this interaction will become evident as you 
understand the rules and contraints which define the behaviour of the 
cyberspace.



DEFINITIONS

These definitions are brief and are given to allow a fuller understanding of
the descriptions to follow. A more detailed discussion of these terms
will follow later.

CLIENT
-- more --                 A CLIENT is the term to describe a person (USER) who is connected to a
system. The CLIENT may be automated (an AGENT).

SERVER

A SERVER is the central message handling facility which handles the data
flow between CLIENTS. (A bit like a BBS)

LOCAL SERVER (LS)

A LOCAL SERVER is a SERVER that resides on the same machine as the
CLIENT.

REMOTE SERVER (RS)

A REMOTE SERVER is not at the same physical machine as the CLIENT in
question.

CYBERTERM (CT)

This is the term to define the CLIENT and the LOCAL SERVER together which a USER
-- more --                 interfaces to. This all resides on his local machine.

SECTOR

A SECTOR is a region of CYBERSPACE which is controlled by a single
SERVER.

SECTOR CONTROLLER (SC)

This is another term for the SERVER, but which covers the CLIENT that is
local to that SERVER (akin to a News conference moderator or a BBS
sysop).

PERMASPACE (PS)

PERMASPACE is an area of the SECTOR which has been allocated to a
specific purpose. The data defining this region resides in the SC which
controls the SECTOR.

PRIVATE PERMASPACE (PPS)

PERMASPACE can belong to a single CLIENT (or else it belongs to the SC). If a
-- more --                 USER acquires a region of a SECTOR for their own use, that region is
called PRIVATE PERMASPACE and is controlled by the owner CLIENT's LOCAL
SECTOR CONTROLLER (ie the SERVER which resides on their own machine).

LINE

A LINE is the connection from the SERVERs to the CLIENTS, LINEs can be
virtual or real.

AGENTS

AGENTS are macros that use the messages and protocols of the system to
perform tasks as the USER himself would. There are 3 types of AGENTS
defined so far. PRIVATE AGENTS, SC AGENTS and INDEPENDENT AGENTS.

ASPECT

ASPECT is the description of an OBJECT and covers visual and audio
definitions in an extensible hierarchy of increasing complexity. All
objects have default ASPECTs.

CYBERSPACE CONFERENCING (CBC)
-- more --                 This is the initial "let's get together and have a chat" aim of the
system and is useful when people ask "So what are you working on?". You
say, "I'm working on a Cyberspace Conferencing system", or something
like that.

GUEST

A GUEST is a CLIENT who is remote to your location who is connected to
your LOCAL SERVER.

BBS

A bulletin board system, which when in "chat" or "conference" mode is a
good analogy for what this system will build upon (ie a graphical
version of a BBS CB channel.)

OBJECTS

OBJECTs are any things which exist within a SECTOR and and listed in a
SERVER database. This includes CLIENTS, AGENTS, PERMASPACE etc.

-- more --                 ID

ID applies to AGENTS, CLIENTS and SERVERS. It is a unique 4 byte number
where the top 4 bits define what type of object the ID belongs to.

FAR - 1,000 units
NEAR - 100 units
CLOSE - 10 units
VERY_CLOSE - 1 unit (ie 26 adjacent units)



A DEMONSTRATION RUN THROUGH

Perhaps the best way to show how the various features of the system interact
is to give a description of a typical session. This description will not
be exhaustive and will give some technical details of the message
passing that will take place during such a session. A complete
description of all the features will not be given here as that would
take too long and this is only meant to be an overview. However, what I
hope is to be able to give some insight into what the working system
will be like.
-- more --                 So here we go.
(by the way this description is of a screen and keyboard system, but as
stated above, you can use whatever hardware/imagination you have
available)

First off when you start up the CYBERTERM you have a blank screen with maybe 
a few control buttons around the edges. 

The first step is to log into the LOCAL SERVER. Now this is a SECTOR 
CONTROLLER that resides on the same machine and in the first incarnation of 
the software is all in the same executable. 

This connection is done by hitting the 'connect' key
(or mouse button etc). This will send a REQUEST_TO_ENTER message to your
LOCAL SERVER, but first the interface will require that you enter some
parameters. These are:

  1) your proposed entry point into the LOCAL SECTOR, and 
  
  2) the proposed viewing direction. 
  
-- more --                 In a more advanced system these parameters will probably be pre-set in 
an option menu so you don't have to enter these details each time, but 
that's the way it is now 

(Note: There are quite a few places where things can be pre-set like 
this, as you'll see).

Once the CLIENT software has assembled this data it sends the message to
the LOCAL SERVER prepended by your ID, a unique identifying code (4
bytes) that defines you as a human CLIENT as well as giving you a unique
handle for reference purposes. An additional parameter, velocity, is set 
to zero and is the final part of the message. 

The connection between the CLIENT and the LOCAL SERVER is a buffer 
that emulates a LINE. 

A daemon type function transfers the message across to the SERVER's input 
(and visa versa). 

The reason this is done is so that the software for a REMOTE SERVER and 
the LOCAL SERVER will be the same, except that the daemon will be 
different (ie transfering data to and from a modem, serial line, socket, 
-- more --                 or whatever). So as far as the SERVER is concerned it is running 
autonimously from the CLIENT and the human interface handling software.

The SERVER checks its internal database of objects to see if you are
allowed to enter at the specified point (more on that in a moment) then
sends a MOVE_TO message back to the CLIENT. This includes the CLIENT's
ID to make sure the right person gets the message (not necessary
obviously as you're the only one logged into your machine), a location
tuple, a direction tuple and a velocity tuple (which is zero in this
case). Now it looks like we're already sending redundant information, but
these are generic commands that can apply to many situations.

You CLIENT software now gets this MOVE_TO message and can throw up
an image on the screen which shows what the SECTOR looks like from this
point.

What's there to display? Well by default the 'floor' of the sctor is
blue and can be displayed as a grid. The range of co-ords is 2**16
(32768) only positive, as a 32 bit fixed decimal number. This
effectively gives a cube 32768 units on a side. That seems small but
think of each unit as one metre. This means the SECTOR is about 32kms
cubed, with increments down to 1/30 mm. I really think this will cator
-- more --                 for system (and user) requirements for a long time to come. There is
room for much more detail than this actually (2**32 time more) as is 
shown later under PRIVATE PERMASPACE.

Okay, so we see a blue grid below us. Our CLIENT software is keeping
track of our velocity and co-ords at the last vector change (ie time
stamped) in its internal object database (this is separate from the 
SERVER's  object database). So a simple look at the time and a scan of 
the database will give the current location of all objects and the 
screen can be updated accordingly. If your machine is slow this screen 
update is slow etc.

Now that you're logged into the LOCAL SERVER things get a bit more
interesting. To make things a bit clearer I'll skip over the details a
bit here and get to a remote connection.

Suffice to say that the objects contained in the LOCAL SERVER all belong
to your PRIVATE PERMASPACE. There may be objects here, for instance that
represent your hard disk and so you may have a graphical operating system
where you can move files, launch applications etc. You can construct
objects and store them for later use. Certain areas may be defined as
dorrways to the control of real-world apparatus by telepresence etc. So
-- more --                 you now have your own SECTOR, a whole world really, in which to create
and move. Now all this on your own machine is nice but dull.

The next step is to send a TRANSFER_SECTOR command. This will move you
to another SECTOR. This will obviously be a REMOTE SECTOR. It's up to
you to specify a legal SECTOR you wish to transfer to and it's up to
your LOCAL SECTOR CONTROLLER to know how to connect to the SECTOR.
Asumming all this has been set up your LOCAL SC (for modem) dials up the
remote SC and identifies itself as an SC that has a CLIENT that wants to
enter. This is sent as a REQUEST_TO_ENTER command (as before). Your
CLIENT software knows that to issue a TRANSFER_SECTOR message you must
enter a location and view direction so it prompts you for them (or gets
it from pre-set options as before). The local SC passes the info on to
the remote SC. If the request message is okay, a MOVE_TO command is
sent from the remote SC to the local SC which now knows that any data
coming in from the CLIENT (on LINE x) is transfered straight to the
remote SC (on LINE y) and visa versa.

Now that your CLIENT software has a new location and viewdirection it
adjusts it's internal object database and updates the screen accordingly
(the blue grid). 

-- more --                 When you entered the SECTOR the SC sent a message of its own to all 
other users who are within NEAR (100 units) of where you entered.
These messages say what your ID is, your vector and location (this is
actually a PERSONAL_ASPECT_DATA message which has ID, vector and
location in the front of the message but without the ASPECT data as the
SC doesn't have this yet). 

These other users may have their systems set up to ignore these 
(unexpected) messages, but if they process them then you, 
the new user, will appear on their screens in the appropriate place and will be
placed in their individual object databases. They may also have a
database of 'know ASPECTS' and can check to see if they already know
what you look like and so can display you in your full glory straight
away. Alternatively they may have their system set up to automatically request
your APSECT if it is unknown and to display it then.

Anyway, you've just entered this REMOTE SECTOR.

Now you can send a message (or a more sophisticated system would be
pre-set) to ask the REMOTE SC what the brief details are of all users
within NEAR of your location (that is, to send you PERSONAL_ASPECT_DATA
messages with ID, vector and direction). This data is added into your
-- more --                 CLIENT's object database (with a time stamp) and the objects appear on
your screen with the default ASPECT. You can request the details of
other users over different distances first off if you like. Once you know
the ID of other users you can REQUEST_ASPECT_DATA of a specific ID, to
whatever level of detail of ASPECT the REMOTE SC has in it's database.
So on your screen these other users appear as arrows (their default
ASPECT) or their real shape. 

When you move (that is, change your velocity or direction) your CLIENT
automatically sends a message (MOVE_TO) to the SERVER. If this is okay by
the SERVER then it sends a MOVE_TO message to you telling you where to
move to (the reason for this is made clear later) and then the SERVER 
distributes the message to all NEAR CLIENTS. In this way, as you watch 
your screen with these objects moving around in straight lines until 
they change vec/vel when you get a message from the REMOTE SC telling 
you their new velocity/direction. If you turn around your system sends 
a MOVE_TO message that is distributed and others see your shape turn around etc.

It is important to note that there is no collision control and it is quite
possible for you to move straight through someone else. 

(Note: The only possible exception to this is stopping over a PERMASPACE
-- more --                 unit you do not own (see later) or the possiblity that two CLIENTS
cannot be at the same point at the same time. There is no logical reason
why this could not be so, it's just that it doesn't see right to me.
Being instantaneaously at the sam epoint is okay, (ie moving through
each other), but being stationary at the same point? Comments please.)

An optional message that you can send to the SC is CHANGE_UPDATE_RATE 
which tells the SC how often to send you location, vel and vec updates 
of all CLIENTS within a given distance of yourself. Normally you would 
have to request this information specifically and the position of users 
you see on the screen may be false (for example a user may drift out 
of the NEAR distance from you but your object database is still tracking 
them saying they are moving at such and such a vector and speed when 
actually they may have changed direction etc. So with a CHANGE_UPDATE_RATE 
message you can request to be updated on the stats of users who are 
NEAR or FAR or whatever say every 10 seconds. Of course if they move when 
they are within NEAR of you then you will be automatically updated anyway).

So now you can sit and watch these shapes going by.

Other commands within a SECTOR are SEND_MAIL, JUMP_TO, 
REQUEST_SECTOR_TRANSFER etc.
-- more --                 Similarly to  requesting the ASPECT of users in the area, you can
request the ASPECT of PERMASPACE in the area. 

PERMASPACE is permanaent regions that default to blue. 

These will usually consist of PRIVATE PERMASPACE but some regions may 
be owned by the SC such as public database access areas and public 
bulletin boards (more on these later).

Just like CLIENTS, PERMASPACE has a default ASPECT that is a blue cube
that occupies the unit cube that is the centre of its local co-ordinate
space. Requests for higher level ASPECTS may reveal these cubes to be
buildings, flashing lights or data structures etc. 

A PRIVATE PERMASPACE ASPECT may reveal that it belongs to a friend of 
yours. (It may his name on top or maybe you recognise his style of 
castle!) 

You can move through PERMASPACE but you CANNOT stop (ie have 0 velocity) 
when in a unit cube of PERMASPACE which does not belong to you. 

-- more --                 So you stop one unit away (VERYCLOSE) and send a 
REQUET_TO_ENTER_PRIVATE_PERMASPACE. This is interpreted by the SC as 
a TRANSFER_SECTOR message, to the LOCAL SERVER of the user who owns 
that PP. If the request is okayed by the owner then you are sent a 
MOVE_TO message that moves you to the coords of the PP. 

Now you have transfered to a new SECTOR and are controlled by
the owner's private SC on his machine. The remote SC you were controlled
by now routes all your data straight to the LINE that that new SC is on.
(in a similar way to how your LOCAL SC is re-routing all your data
straight through to the modem).

Once again your screen is blank and you can request to see what's around
you. This person may have his SECTOR set up to look like a lounge room
or as rolling hills. All messages from users who you could see before
(ie those outside that unit cube of PP that you're in) are filtered out
to reduce bandwidth required (you may, for instance want to keep mail
coming through. If you have a powerful system you may still get all
'outside' messages but make the walls of the living room appear
transparent like smoked glass etc).

Now that you are in his SECTOR you must abide by his rules. If you send
-- more --                 a MOVE_TO message that will make you collide with object in his PP (eg a
chair or wall) then his sector can return okay for that request, but
when it calculates that you've hit a wall, it can send an addittional
MOVE_TO message that sets your velocity to zero. In this way you must
follow the rules he has set up in his PP. Obviously if he proves to be
obnoxious you can send a EXIT_SECTOR message that the main REMOTE SC
intercepts and so moves you back out into public cyberspace,
garuanteed.

Other users can enter the PP of your frined at the same time  so you
can have a 'private conference with only those present'. At that time
his LOCAL SC daemon has set up secondary virtual LINES to allow the
messages from several remote CLIENTS to come down the one modem
connection. As each message is preceeded by the message senders ID, it's
a fairly simply task fo rthe daemon to put the incoming messages into
the appropriate virtual LINE buffers so the SC thinks there are lots of
people/modems connected up.

Of course, the main remote SC may also provide private conference rooms where
similar duscussion can take place.

This PP may alternatively be the front end to access a commercial
-- more --                 database, a game service, a ticket sales office etc.

So you want to establish your own PP within the public SECTOR? You send
a REQUEST_TO_AQUIRE_PRIVATE_PERMASPACE message that is sent via the SC
to anyone who is CLOSE to you (within 10 units). If less than 50% of
those nearby say 'no' to the SC then you aquire 1 unit of PP and this is
registered in the SC's object database. You can optionally send
PERMASPACE_DATA messages to the SC that define the ASPECT of your PP to
whatever level of detail you desire so others can see your new
aquisition. Clearly, you can aquire several PP units next to each other
and build up a composite structure that is more impressive.

This aquisition is monitored by the SC and there may be limits defined.

Some reqions of PP that belong to commercial users may be large (eg a
database service for stock information may have a large area of PP that
(when you request to see higher level aspects) may be  large building
surrounded by wide grass areas with fountains and gardens). Maybe there
would be large areas within the owned PP that has no higher ASPECT so
that in a crowded area of many PPs the structure will stand out as it
has all this 'open' space around it.

-- more --                 You can send mail to a friend by several methods. The most straight
forward would be to use the SEND_MAIL message where you specify the
recipients ID and then the message (no set format, just specify the
length in 4 bytes). The mail will be sent straight to his LINE. If he is
currently transfered to another SECTOR, the mail is sent on to the next
SECTOR to which he travelled (he may have moved on from there too).

He may have his CLIENT software set up so mail appears as a flashing icon on
the screen or as a full letter box outside the little cottage that is
his PP.

Mail can also be send to a location and the SC will try to inform the
owner, if the mail is not received, a MAIL_FAILED message is returned.
Text mail may be appended to a PP ASPECT temporarily. In this way if
no-one is 'home' (maybe not logged in or in another SECTOR) then you can
send the mail to the PP location and when he person returns he will see
an added object on his normal PP aspect. This object may be a piece of
paper with the text message written on it.

In a similar way a true bulletin board could be set up, where people
could leave messages for others to read.

-- more --                 So you can conference with otheres, send mail, access commercial
services etc.

The commercial services may first connect to the system using their
original 2D flat screen interface, so when you enter their PP you just
see a single screen. In this way the interface changes would be minimal
to start with but they could develop better interfaces to make data
access more efficient. A statistics service could have a PP where data was
represented as dynamic 3D structures etc.

Probably the most useful items within the cybersapce are your AGENTS.
These items exist as packets of messages that together form an entity
that is a type of object. See the comprehensive definition later on for
details. Agents can do whatever you can do, in your place. Some agents
are simply objects that you use (for instance a 'design-an-aspect' agent
may allow you to draw items in 3D (walls, texture, motion etc) and will
then create the ASPECT data for you). It may be an access key tool (eg you
might guy a '10 shot' agent from a database service. When you want to
access that database you instruct the agent as to what you want. The
agent then goes off to the databases PP and gets a high prioirty of
service (because you paid for it!) and also knows how the database works
and so can access the data faster and then mail the data back to you (or
-- more --                 maybe return to you itself with its ASPECT changed to show you the data)
and after the tenth use it doesn't come back. 

The last sort of agent is independant. These actually are macro
languages that are executed by the SC and may act as guides
to newcomers or perform tasks within the sector for you (ie like a
servant). They can exist by themselves. You can have an AGENT that
'lives' in you PP and answers requests to enter from other CLIENTS while
you are tied up somewhere else. Now this brings on all sorts of
possibilities. You could send an AGENT to a conference in your place and
it may respond to text as a human would, to gather data for you. For
this reason and others, there is one strict rule, and that is that the
default ASPECT of agents are a white star made of three perpendicular
axes, no matter what.

Another example is to have several agents that travel with you in unison
and which have ASPECTS that fit into yours to make one larger, more
impressive ASPECT.

One ASPECT detail that hasn't been mentioned is sound. Obviously a sound
interface would be good (so you can talk to people you meet other than
just sending mail or typing stuf in during a private conference). Sound
-- more --                 would be easy enough to implement into the SEND_MAIL message protocol
(you get mail from someone who is in such and such a direction
therefore the headphones position the sound source accordingly). But I
would like to incorporate it into the ASPECT as well so you could hear
someone comming, even if you were looking in the wrong direction.

(Note: Its clear that this system is open to abuse to rogue CLIENTS that send
invalid messages. The buck will have to stop at the SERVER and so this
could end up being a pretty awesome beast as far as functionality goes.)


DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS NOT COVERED BEFORE

(incomplete section)
(note: I covered a bit more detail than planned above, hope it suffices
for now or I'll never send this thing!)
===================================================================
===================================================================
        - each CLIENT has an ID derived from their "login" address (eg internet 
        address) and so is unique. Along with ID, each CLIENT has an ASPECT 
        which describes how they appear to other CLIENTS. ASPECT by default 
        is an arrow with a single feather to indicate 3D orientation 
-- more --                         ASPECT has levels, the one just stated 
        is the default level, 0. The next level is "wire frame" representation 
        that consists of a variable length list of points and vectors. They 
        have variable colour and have a DYNAMIC | STATIC parameter, if DYMNAMIC 
        is TRUE then motion paramters follow (undefined yet). The last parameter
        is EXTENDED. If EXTENDED is TRUE then a further level follows defining 
        solid geometry descriptions, which end with the EXTENDED parameter 
        for future expansion. Things are designed this way so that a simple 
        system (AT with CGA graphics) can select only the minimum display 
        criteria because that's all it can handle. Better machines '486, 
        Silicon Graphics Workstation etc can go for full solid rendering etc. 
===================================================================
===================================================================

SOFTWARE STATUS

The system so far has a CLIENT that connects to the LOCAL SERVER and
allows the user to move around within their own SECTOR, requesting 
information on and displaying PERMASPACE objects that are already in the 
SERVER's object database. This is all in wire frame (easily upgraded to solids,
but it goes too slow on the PC (386SX) for development work).

-- more --                 This system works on a PC and on a SUN (X11).

The graphics library used is VOGLE, but REND386 is being kept in mind
for PC stuff. An Amiga version is in the works (mainly just requires the
VOGLE driver). (VOGLE is available from most ftp sites I assume, I got
it from the Australian ftp mirror site, archie.au:/graphics/graphics/echidna)

The code is in ANSI C. This is ideal stuff for C++ but that would limit
the platforms we could easily port to (and not enough people are
comfortable with it yet).

HELP WANTED

As you can see, there are many ideas brewing here and so few
implemented. I really hope to have something significant done by the
beta release date later this year ('92) before tasks and improvements
can be farmed out to others. Ideas on modifying the concepts involved
would be wonderful, but programmers with time would be even better. Managing
remote development seems a difficult task. Breaking this into neat
packages isn't really possible at the moment. The only area that could
be done (perhaps) is the graphical operating system stuff for your
local computer. I hope people will disagree with me and show how this
-- more --                 can be done as a joint effort. My time for co-ordination of such an
effort is woefully limited which is why I have perservered with the
programming alone thus far.

As I think I mentioned earlier, I want to make this software freely
available with limited source distribution until it looks stable. But
in the long run, the source should be available for everyone to update
and use as they will. My main reasoning for this is to give everyone a
chance to have a working interactive system that they can connect up
together.

So far I have received about 30 requests for information/code. This
document will be posted to sci.virtual-worlds and sent to each of the
senders. If after reading this you want to help with programming, then
let me know. Any and all comments (public and email) would be 
greatly appreciated.

  What ever happened to real bulletin-board systems?

     First off, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I cannot
be  objective in these notes.   These are observations,  but they
are from  1) a Sysop
          2) a user of 8BBS, the greatest BBS ever evolved
          3) a boy ... who's become a boyish programmer
          4) an old timer....1977 was when I first started
             using BBS systems.
          5) the author of a BBS system

If you're expecting objectivity, then don't bother reading on.  I have a
rather unique perspective on the entire BBS scene.  I've been around since
close to the beginning, and I'm wondering what has happened.  Have BBS's gone
the way of CB?  Is the entire system in a slump?  Is there anything wrong at
all?

I'm going to try to present these questions and show how things have
changed...for the better, and for the worst.

HISTORY:
-- more --                   A long time ago, in a city far-far away, two men had an insight.  Ward
Christensen and Randy Suess wanted a way to leave notes and messages to their
programmer/engineer friends.  Back then, modems were used by field-engineers
and some high-level executives to talk to their companies computers.  A 300
baud modem was extremely fast, as most people were using 110 baud TeleTypes.
Ward and Randy devloped the concept of the BBS.  They called it CBBS, for
"Computer Bulletin Board System." CBBS was the first of its kind.  It was an
enormous program written in 8080 assmebly language.  By our standards today, it
was kludgy and bug-ridden, but back then it was heavenly.  Users could enter
messages and read messages...  that was about it.

  CBBS was a wonderful concept, but it was localized to the Chicago area.  Ward
and Randy were the only ones who were running the program.  Then Bill Blue came
along and wrote ABBS, which was designed to "emulate" the CBBS system.  I feel
it was ABBS, rather than CBBS which made the real breakthrough.  While ABBS was
much less powerful, and more difficult to use, it could be run on a "universal"
machine:  --The Apple ][--

  Anyone with an Apple ][ and a D.C.  Hayes MM][ modem could run ABBS.  This
program could be installed in a matter of minutes, and anyone could have their
own bulletin board system.  Soon after the release of ABBS, several other BBS
-- more --                 programs (for various computers) soon followed.  ABBS was the king for many
years, just because there were more ABBS systems than any other BBS program
available.

  It is this time that I would like to refer to as the "Golden age of the BBS."
It wasn't as golden as you might think.  Most Sysops would come home every
evening from work to find that their BBS had crashed because of yet another
bug.  Even back then, user's logged in under false names and left obscene
messages.

  The one point that made that age golden was the users.  Without users, a BBS
is just a program.  With users, it gains a personality, and if I may be
metaphysical, a soul.  The users MAKE the BBS.  A Sysop may have the greatest
BBS program in the world, but without active users, he just has a computer
wasting line-current.

LIFE IN THE "GOLDEN AGE"

  A user would think nothing of spending his Saturday helping "The Sysop" find
an intermittant bug in the BBS program.

  A user would not only answer his or HER mail, but also butt into other
-- more --                 people's conversations and throw in his/her two cents worth.

  A user would suggest improvements to make the system easier to use.

  A Sysop would care for his BBS like a baby.  He'd spend 2 hours each night
writing messages and playing with modifications to the program.

  A Sysop would NOT restrict conversation to one particular topic...such as
CP/M software.

  A Sysop would tolerate kids who were just learning how to use modems.  He'd
even give them a hand getting things working.

  A Sysop would [on his own preference] dilligently weed out obscene or
"pseudo-illegal" messages, -- or -- promote them as he saw fit.

  Users would start clubs, such as the well known "Gabber Gang" and later the
infamous "Phone Phriekers" who figured so prominently into BBS history.

  The government didn't try to restrict BBS users.  It was just "us" against
tyranny (at that time "Ma Bell").  Although most users did not approve of
"Phone Phreaking", everyone talked about it, and was interested in it for
-- more --                 curiosity sake if nothing else.  [Hard to believe, but true.]

  Uploading and downloading of programs did not exist.

  BBS's were few and far between.  When I wrote the OxGate, the two closest
other CP/M based machines were Kelly Smith in Simi Valley (375 miles away), and
"Jim C" in Larkspur (100 miles away).  People tended to congregate on the local
system.

  WHAT HAS KILLED BBS SYSTEMS:

  1) Program uploading and downloading.  People just get their programs and
leave.

  2) The technical clique's retaliation against "gabbers" who just used the
systems for personal communication.

  3) Too many BBS systems in one area.  BBS's are still alive and healthy in
low-density areas.

  4) The loss of "anonimity" among BBS users.  The BBS used to be the place to
escape.  Where no one had to be "themselves." Users such as "James Bond" and
-- more --                 "Captain Scarlet" were given free reign to vent their fantasies.  Today, most
systems do not allow false names so they can keep track of users.

  5) The anti-hacker movement.  More and more people today think the word
"hacker" means "phone phriek/computer crasher." All it ever meant was "great
programmer." You would feel proud if someone labeled you a "hacker."

  6) The press' ignorance of the BBS community.  By trying to make a scandal
out of all of it, they ruined a great form of communication.  In particular,
the magazine "InfoWorld" has done more harm to the BBS community than other
press organization.  While they actively TRIED to HELP the community, they have
caused more harm in their mis-reporting of info.

  7) Sysop's ignorance.  Quite frankly, the average quality of "Sysop" has
dropped.  Sysop's are (on the whole) less active and less responsive than 5
years ago.  More and more of them are technically incompetent, they couldn't
fix a bug if it bit them in the nose.

  All of these problems are inter-related.  We can't solve any of them until
all of them are solved.  From my descriptions it should be obvious that the
"golden age" certainly wasn't all gold.  People like "James Bond" and "Sam
Daniels" had to be stopped, but the pendulum has swung too far to the opposite
-- more --                 side.

  These observations are very general.  I've noticed this swing, and it has
taken place on 95% of all of the system's I've called across America.  It's sad
that these problems have stabbed us in the back, but it's not too late to try
and bring about a change.  I don't have the answers, but maybe these
observations will prompt thought into this death of a virtual "art form" of
communication.

  There is one possible solution to this problem...  the acceptance of children
again.  For too long we've been kicking off kids (both phyiscal and "kids at
heart").  They've been disruptive, and caused fights galore.  Many have even
tried to crash the systems they used.

  "If there's any hope, it lies with the proles." -- George Orwell, _1984_

  Perhaps the thing to do is call a few local Commodore and Apple boards and
let the users know that they're just as welcome on your super-fancy 100mb 2400
baud RCP/M system as any of your so- called "serious users" .  .  .  "serious
users" who can't even bring themselves to answer their own mail.  Saddening.

            file system tree.  Your current directory is always displayed
            right above the Archives prompt.  You may view the file listing
            in the current directory with the D)ir command.

D)ir      - View the listing of files in the current directory.  Among the
            information displayed is the file name, file size in bytes,
            date of upload, and a single line text description of the file.

F)ind     - Locate a file by title.  If you quickly want to locate a file
            anywhere in the Archives section, and you know part of the
            file name, this command is very useful in quickly locating
            the file.

M)aster   - Move to the top of the directory tree.  This is an easy way
            for you to return to the root directory, as opposed to using
-- more --                             the .) command multiple times.

.)        - Move back to previous directory.  This performs the exact
            opposite function of the C)hange command.


[File Transfer Commands]

A)rc      - View the contents of an .arc, .lzh, or .zip file.  This command
            will display a list of files and their attributes that are
            located within an archive file.  If you download an archived
            file, be sure that you have the correct program to extract
            the files contained therein.  Use ARC for .arc files, LHARC for
            .lzh files, and PKZIP for .zip files.

P)rotocol - Set Transfer Protocol. Mindvox currently supports the Xmodem,
            Ymodem and Zmodem protocols.

R)eceive  - Upload a file to Mindvox. Be sure you are using the same
            protocol on Mindvox and in your terminal software, and your
            settings are 8N1.

-- more --                 S)end     - Download a file from Mindvox. The above rule also applies.

V)iew     - View a text file. This allows you to download or simply view
            a text file without the use of a protocol.  You can view files
            online, as well as buffer and save them with your terminal
            software.

W)rite    - Write text to a file.  This allows you to upload a text file
            without the use of a protocol.  This command can also be used
            for creating small text files (ie: readme.txt) on the system.


[Other Commands]

H)elp     - Displays the online help screen.

Q)uit     - Leave the Archives section and return to the main menu.

/* Introduction */
   By the Informatik staff

-- more --                       Welcome to the inaugural issue of Informatik, an electronic periodical
devoted to the distribution of information not readily available to the public,
with a particular emphasis on technology and the computing world.  First and 
foremost, this publication is dedicated to the freedom of information.
This journal is made possible by The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution
which states:

      Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
      or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; OR ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM
      OF SPEECH OR OF THE PRESS; or the right of the people peaceably to
      assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances.

In this and coming issues, we plan to exercise our First Amendment rights to
the best of our ability.  We will print feature articles on hacking, phreaking,
and various other illicit activities.  We also plan on bringing you recent news
and gossip from the underground, anything news of interest to hackers, 
phreakers, grifters, cyber-punks, and the like.  Informatik will also provide a
plethora of information on the inner workings of corporate America and the U.S.
Government.

DO distribute this freely! Remember this is not illegal, this is information.

-- more --                 stated. All sources of information for a specific article is listed in the
introduction or conclusion of the atricle. We will not accept any articles that
are unoriginal, plagiarized, or contain invalid or false information. Articles
will be accepted from anyone who meets those criteria. We are not dependant
upon readers for articles, since members of LOD/H and a select group of others
will be the primary contributers, but anyone can submit articles.

     Readers are encouraged to download all files for each issue, not just the
ones they are interested in. The reason for this is twofold: The newsletter
was designed to be a group effort, and the files herein were not intended for
individual distribution, and secondly, keeping the issue intact allows you to
distribute it to other BBS's and phriends who are interested in it.

     There is no set date for releasing issues, as we have no monetary or legal
obligation to the readers, but we predict subsequent issues will be released
between 2 and 3 months from the previous one. Thus, expect 4 to 6 issues a year
assuming we continue to produce them, which we intend to do.

     Newsletter sponsors are boards which will get the newsletter directly from
the staff as soon as it is released, and has added our 'staff account' to the
userlist in order for the readers to respond directly to us about the content
of the newsletter. If your board would like to become a sponsor, leave us mail

 This article will explain the newly developed LASS system (AT&T Bell Labs),
 and how it may affect us in the near future. Note that the service as it
-- more --                  appears for customers is called "CLASS", the C standing for Custom. I
 assume this is just for looks.

 LASS
 ----

    The telephone was destined to become a well used and powerful tool for
 otherwise tedious tasks. Gas meters and other metered services would be
 surveyed through the use of automatic data retrieval employing telephone
 communications. All in all, some have big plans for the uses one could put
 the telephone system up to, and CLASS is one plan that is going to drop
 an innovative bombshell on the telecommunicating world.

    At this moment, a local CCIS network feature is being developed by
 Bell Laboratories. This feature will change the way people use fones, and
 will also change the attitude in which they use them. It will give far
 more control of the telephone to the user than ever before. This feature
 is called CLASS (Custom Local Area Signalling Services).

    Everyone will find something useful in this newly developed telephone
 feature. Pizza parlours will no longer have to worry about fraudulent italian
 food mongers, and little old ladies won't have to worry about prank calls
-- more --                  by certain dubious characters.

    What are all these fantastic features?  These features will
 include call back of the last caller, regardless of whether you have their
 telephone number or not. Another will be distinct call waiting tones, and
 preselected call forwarding (only those people whom you wish to speak to
 will be forwarded). This is a rudimentary list of CLASS features to come.
 It is a very powerful system, and it all relys on LCCIS (Local Common
 Channel Interoffice Signalling), an intra-LATA version of the ever-popular
 CCIS.

 CCIS Background
 ---------------

    CCIS was originally introduced in 1976 as, basically, the signalling
 system to end all signalling systems. Instead of using the voice grade
 trunks to carry signalling information on, a data network would be used. This
 network is comprised of data links from each TO [involved with CCIS] to
 the appropriate STP (signal transfer point). Signalling information is sent
 through these links at 4800 bps to the STPs (Note that baud rates may increase
 due to the economic availability of faster data communications hardware),
 where stored program control routes the signalling information to the needed
-- more --                  offices in order to open and complete the call path. SPC checks automatically
 for on-hook/off-hook status before opening the path, and if the status is
 off-hook (in this case the customer does not have the call waiting custom
 calling feature), returns information to the originating CO to apply a busy
 signal to the customer. This is but one of many features toll CCIS provides
 the network with.

    Since this text is not centered on the topic of toll CCIS, technical
 aspects aren't as important (except for the comparison between the local
 and toll networks for observational purposes): yet it is important to
 notice how automated and flexible this type of signalling method is, as well
 as its speed and efficiency. All the software control involved with local
 and toll networks is called, fittingly, the "stored program control network."
 or ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network). LCCIS will be addressed in a
 future article.

What is N.A.R.C.?
-----------------------------
First of all, it stands for:
 
Nuclear Phreakers/Hackers/Carders
N           A          R  C
 
Pretty creative, eh?  Well, if you're wondering where the 'Nuclear' came from,
that's because the home of N.A.R.C. is located on Nuclear Wasteland.  N.A.R.C.
is about 2 months old as of today and currently has 6 members in it.  It is
phreak/hack/card club so we can hack and share our info with the rest of the
members without getting our codez abused and getting many codez/cardz daily.
On it we also post valuable info on practically every system that is hackable.
heh.  We also go into detail for each other on what we know best so we can
hack/use everything to our full advantage.

The publisher, SFI, distribution site(s), and authors contributing  to  the  NFX
are protected by the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution, which specifically
permits freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

We    accept    article    submissions    of    nearly    any    sort,     about
hack/phreak/anarchy/gov't/etc.

The printed edition of the newsletter may  be  available  soon.  The  info  will
appear here as soon as possible.  To be quite honest, the printed version  looks
a hell of a lot better; but as of now, only the members of SFI receive it.

                            NorthWestern Syndicate
                                  Presents:

                             THE SYNDICATE REPORT
                                 Issue  No. 1

                             Written by The Sensei

  ===========================================================================

    Introduction:

          This file of many to come, will be available to users through-out
the datacommunications world.  It's purpose is to strictly inform users on
current Bell information, and other assorted bits of news which I think will
benefit users.  NOTE:  This is as I said before, strictly Bell information,
and without some background could cause a problem to understand completely.

  ===========================================================================
-- more --                 PC SYSTEMS/EXCHANGE NAME CHANGE:

       PC Systems/Exchange has changed to NorthWestern Syndicate.
Also, if you have been calling the number above, and keep getting a Bell
recording, take it easy.  NWS will be up soon enough.  I will estimate on
the 6th month, of the 1st day.  This is just an approximation.  And If decide
to not set it up, then don't call.  I'll simply not use the number anymore
in my files.

  ===========================================================================

CCSN CARD HOLDERS:

       Corporate Communications advises that, for Bell Employees' convenience,
starting April 14, they will hear an additional dial tone when using their
CCSN Calling Card.  Existing instructions indicate that before entering the
authorization code they  "PAUSE FOR 3 SECONDS...THEN"; effective April 14,
that instruction will be "LISTEN FOR DIAL TONE...THEN".

Information on CCSN Cards, please get a hold on me.  On most
popular Ascii Express Lines/Bul.Board Systems.

Welcome to the first issue of TAP Magazine Online. Publishing an electronic
-- more --                 newsletter is somewhat easier then the hardcopy TAP, but i think i can
continue to do this with some regularity, while still publishing TAP Magazine.
It feels i am jumping on the band wagon since now days it seems everyone
is publishing their own newsletter just to be famous or well known. I salute
the true pioneers who have stuck it out and to those who have been inspirations
to us all. The freedom of information shall never die as long as a few
dedicated people continue to fight for our given rights.

I have no set format yet, and don't plan on making anything fancy. I have just
collected a few text files and thrown them together for those out there to
read. If you want to get something included in TAP you can send it to me.

If you want to get TAP Online issues first call the following boards.

Blitzkrieg 502-499-8933 home to TAP and myself.
Amerika's Most Wanted Bbs 502-491-2749
Hall of Injustice 502-241-9304

All these systems have been up for at least six months and are 24 hours.
I would like to have other boards in different area codes distribute for
me also, so if you want to do this contact me.

-- more --                 I would now like to greet my fellow friends whom i have met in the computer
underground. If i leave anyone out i am sorry.

The Last Mafioso & The West Coast Phone Phreaks of Anarchist Express.
Where the hell did you all disappear to?
Iron Feather Journal, Phantasy, Phrack, Computer Underground Digest,
Activist Times Inc and Ground Zero & TCC Crew, Network Information Access,
and any other group which sends their files to my bbs regularly.

Greets goto Aristotle who helped restart TAP then decided he wanted out. So
now what are you going to do write for 2600? I hope not, sellout!


and now sit back and enjoy the show.....

Greetings fellow CyberNauts:

This gem was downloaded from the DDN on the InterNet. It is a good
guide for learning to hack the Net. If you like what you see leave
note for Argonaut at Rivendell BBS (816) 563-4845. This is my Home
of Port and a small but growing hack/phreak node.

                            The Argonaut

-- more --                             FEATURES OF THE TAC ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM (TACACS)

To log in to the network via a MILNET TAC, you MUST have a unique ID
and Access Code (TAC Access Card).  These cards are issued by the DDN
Network Information Center (NIC) only after a user has been authorized
by the Host Administrator of the host on which the user has his
primary mailbox or account.

IF YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED YOUR TAC ACCESS CARD, AND HAVE A LEGITIMATE
REQUIREMENT TO ACCESS THE NETWORK VIA A MILNET TAC, CONTACT YOUR HOST
ADMINISTRATOR!  (DO NOT CONTACT THE NIC FOR AUTHORIZATION).

If you do not know who your Host Administrator is, you may find out by
using the "WHOIS" command on the NIC.DDN.MIL host.  Instructions on
using "WHOIS" are as follows: When you finish reading this message,
type "quit" as instructed.  After the connection to NIC.DDN.MIL is closed,
type "@n" again.  You will be told how to find your Host Administrator.
When finished, type "logout<RETURN>" at the prompt and you will be
returned to the TAC.

habbits.  We could call it DIRTY NEEDLE SPREE.
     But why bother, when the thrill of urban blight is already being dealt
with so successfully.  We should stick to family entertainment, I decided as I
carried the pizza up the hill to headquarters.

Scene 1: ROCK WORSHIP

     A girl named Matilda and her great aunt Gertrude sit on a porch swing.
Gertrude is an old hag with a polio-withered arm who smokes a lot of Kools.
The porch where they sit and swing is surrounded by mallow bushes whose wilting
puce blooms are the same color and texture as Gertrude's lingerie.  Gertrude
pops a lemon drop, licks her chin, and begins to talk.
     "My grandparents came over on a boat from Bohemia.  Once here, they set up
a dressmaking shop.  They did well.  But the more money they made, the more
they hated each other.
     "One day my grandfather withdrew all their savings, got drunk, and lost
everything at the races.  Hungover and broke, he tied a rock to his neck and
drowned himself in six inches of pond water.  My grandmother brought the rock
home from the police station and put it on the mantlepiece in her front parlor,
so she could thank it every morning."
     Cutaway to a single shot of a bustled woman sitting beside a hearth fire.
She strokes the rock she holds in her lap, and hums.


Scene 2: MOM ENTERS THE NEW AGE
-- more --                      "Why does your mother spend so much time in the bathroom these days?"
Gertrude asks Matilda as they watch the sunset from the porch.
     "She's trying to rejuvenate herself.  The bathroom is her spa."
     Gertrude lights up a Kool, the sack of flesh on her good arm swaying.
"I'd rather play pinochle," she says.
     "Yeah," says Matilda.
     Cutaway to several shots of a postmenopausal matron taking enemas by
candlelight.  She looks into the toilet to catch another glimpse of the past
she just expelled - as if the swirl of flushing could foretell the reversal of
her future.  In the background, surrounded by crystals, a peach-colored
cassette deck intones, "You alone have the power to create your own reality."


Scene 3: NEXT DOOR WITH THE BRAUERS

     It has grown late.  By yellow porch light, Matilda is reading aloud from
INTERVIEW.  Gertrude, smoking, looks out into the green dark.
     "Bill Brauer!" says Matilda, turning a page.  "Wow.  He used to live next
door.  I thought he was only good at lawn jobs.  But he's a hot new painter."
     Matilda picks open a bug bite on her shank as she begins to read about
Bill.
-- more --                      Cutaway to years ago, next door.
     Bill is a wiry fifteen-year-old youth with stringy hair, bagged eyes, and
knee-high suede moccasins into which he tucks his jeans.  After positioning
half of his sister Nancy's thirty plastic horse models in the stud-fuck stance
atop the rumps of the other half, Bill opens all of the windows of the second
floor sun porch, then sprinkles birdseed on its floors.  When a good crop of
pigeons has flown in to peck, Bill slides outside and closes the windows with a
laundry hook.  Then he run upstairs and shoots all the pigeons with a pellet
gun.  Meanwhile his twelve-year-old sister Nancy, clad in a leopard print
bikini, hangs by her knees from a sycamore branch in the back yard and shrieks,
"I'm adopted!  I'm adopted!  I know I'm adopted!"  Oblivious, their mother,
Cookie, sits at a vanity table in the grey light of her bedroom, slowly
smearing on more coral lipstick.


Scene 4: LILLY IN THE CITY

     "I got a postcard from Lilly today," says Matilda, putting down her
magazine.  "It was a picture of the Manhattan skyline.  She wrote, 'I've
started wearing white press-on fingernails and big gaudy rings.'  I wonder what
else she's doing up there.  Here she was always on the verge of going to a
-- more --                 Polynesian restaurant."
     Gertrude sips her Fresca and says, "She was named after my step-sister
Lilly, a gun moll for Jelly Roll Eagan.  Cats used to follow that woman
everywhere.  She died blind at ninety in stiletto heels and falsies, her
bathroom wastebasket full of dye gloves.  She hardly had any hair left, but
what was left was red."
     Cutaway to a woman out on a fire escape, muttering curses to a sunken
moon.  Her red hair is a mess.  She wears silk charmeuse, and an eyepatch.  The
camera tracks to the window, then focuses on the room inside, where a man in a
muscle shirt erases each eye in every photo of that evening's newspaper.


Scene 5: KOOLS

     Gertrude is snoring, so Matilda reaches over and filches a Kool from her
gold lame' cigarette wallet.  She snaps the smell of butane shut and draws hard
on the butt.  Closing her eyes, she remembers her days of smoking menthols.
     Cutaway to Matilda as an early teen, sauntering up the street to the
pinball parlor - her hip hugger bell bottoms swishing the thick dusk, her
halter top Egyptian, her belly button on qualudes... the coal of a Kool
burnishing her copper eyeshadow.  The soundtrack to her saunter is the wail of
far off trains.
-- more --                 
Scene 6: THE END

     Matilda flicks the cigarette in a high arc out to the gutter.  Gertrude
still snores.  Matilda sprays her with OFF and goes inside.

-- more --                 Here is what the ACLU Handbook _The Rights of Students_ (3rd edition)
by Janet R. Price, Alan H. Levine, and Eve Cary says:

-------begin quote-------

[question:] Can a school prohibit students from handing out all
literature, including underground newspapers, on school property?

[answer:] No. This would violate the Supreme Court's decision in

distribution materially and substantially interferes with school
activities,{32} and even some disruption in handing out the literature
does not justify banning the literature completely. As one court said
of students in a particular case, "It is their misconduct in the
manner in which they distributed the paper which should have been
stopped, not the idea of printing newspapers itself.{33}

That same court emphasized that point that minor disruptions must be
tolerated to accommodate the right of students to express their views.
Since the "interruption of class periods caused by the 'newspaper'
were minor and relatively few in number," the source said, the
-- more --                 _Tinker_ standard of "material and substantial disruption" had not
been met.

[Addendum to Chapter Two]

As this book went to press, the United States Supreme Court, in
_Hazelwood School District v. Kuhmeire_ (decided January 15, 1988),
upheld the power of [high] school officials to control the content of
school-financed newspapers.  [...]  As a result of the _Kuhmeire_
decision, school officials now may censor stories in official school
publications so long as, in the words of the Supreme Court, "their
actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical
concerns."[...]

The Court's decision distinguished between student speech that is part
of the school curriculum, such as official publications, theatrical
productions, and other school-sponsored activities, and all other
forms of student speech that take place on school property. The latter
would include leaflets, buttons, unofficial, or so-called underground,
newspapers, and other literature that is not school financed. As to
all such forms of speech, the _Tinker_ standards discussed throughout
this chapter continue to apply. In other words, _Kuhlmeier_ gives
-- more --                 school officials no greater power to control either the content or
form of such student speech than they had previously. Thus, school
officials may _not_ censor such speech merely because they believe it
to be biased, poorly written, vulgar, or unsuitable for immature
students. Speech that is not part of the school curriculum may be
prohibited only if there is evidence that it will materially and
substantially disrupt the word of the school.

-- more --                 Welcome to the Free Journal

        This is the first issue of the Free Journal.  This issue is
devoted mainly to the rights which I have to publish this.  I hope you
will be able to see the precedent and realize that this and every
other paper have every right to exist.
        First of all, the point of this is to provide a forum of ideas
and discussion about issues.  Any article which I (or the editors if I
ever get support) feel is good, I will publish.  I will not publish
libel, but I will use the true definition of libel.  (i. e. something
which is knowingly false, will harm someone's social standing, and has
malicious intent.)  (A cartoon making fun of someone is not libel--an
article stating that someone cheated on a test when that is false
would be.)
        Therefore, submissions are welcomed.  The means by which they
can be submitted will be dealt with when the time arises.  (And if
someone wants to let me use their Postscript laser printer, I'd
appreciate it greatly.)
        Remember, nothing should be believed without question;
question everything.  That is my most important statement.  If someone
tells you something, ask for proof.  It does not matter whether that
-- more --                 person is supported by any agency of authority, it is necessary to
question everything you hear.  Therefore, I would like to repeat the
statement that anything you find in here is neither trash nor gospel.
Treat it like you would any other article.  Give it your thought,
check its sources, and formulate an opinion.
        Thank you.      



The Bill of Rights: Alive After 200 Years?

Amendment I
        Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
grievances.
                The Bill of Rights (excerpt)
                Ratified, 15 December 1791

        This is first in a series of articles about the Bill of Rights
and how it is being ignored.  My most important source is Eric
-- more --                 Postpischil's article of October 1990 listing violations of the Bill
of Rights.  Contact me if you would like a copy or other sources for
this article.  (I have run out of space.)
        First let me mention our president.  "I don't know that
atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be
considered patriots."  I assume he hasn't heard of "respecting an
establishment of religion."
        In addition, Native Americans are prohibited from using
peyote, a mild hallucinogen derived from cactus plants, as a religious
sacrament.  However, the Roman Catholic Church is permitted to serve
alcohol, a drug known to cause more deaths than peyote, marijuana, and
cocaine combined, to minors during Holy Communion.  The Supreme Court
has upheld this law.  I don't know what happened to "prohibiting the
free exercise thereof" either.  Maybe it has been voided by the All
Holy War on Rights, er, Drugs.
        The Federal Communications Commission claims that because
radio frequencies are limited, they have the right not only to
regulate who broadcasts over these frequencies, but what exactly they
can say.  In fact, a broadcaster supporting decriminalization of
marijuana would be at risk of FCC intervention.  Another loss to the
War on Truth, I would assume.
        In Alexandria, Virginia, there is a law that prohibits people
-- more --                 from loitering for more than seven minutes and exchanging small
objects. Punishment is two years in jail.  Sherman Jones, 15, was
assaulted by a police officer's hands around his neck after putting
the last bit of pizza crust into his mouth.  I guess "the right of the
people peaceably to assemble" is given up in the Inquisition too.
        This was only a summary of First Amendment violations.  Keep
in touch for summaries of the other amendment's violations.

Subject: Anti-WoD Activists' List May 1992


                       UPDATED
               LIBERTY ACTIVISTS' LIST
                   v 1.03   5/1992

So you're sick of the WoD?  Here's an alphabetical list of
over 90 organisations which support drug law reform, mostly in
the US, though some are based in other countries.  Look for
one in your area. 

There's an active group here for almost any taste.  Joining
your favourite organisation is best, though if you're worried
about persecution, just send anonymous money or a letter of
appreciation.  Take advantage of your democratic rights while
you still have some!

If you're already in a law reform organisation, you can use
-- more --                 this list to contact others with similar interests, and share
information or facilities.  Just knowing that there are others
working on these issues can be a big morale booster.  

Many entries in the following list of groups are reproduced
_with permission_ from the February, 1992 issue of _High
Times_ magazine.  Additional listings have been added from
other sources.  Please reproduce and distribute widely with
this acknowledgment.  Post it on bulletin boards if you can.

               PLEASE SEND NEW LISTINGS

I don't know any more about most of these groups, than what
appears here.  If you know about other active groups not
listed here, or if any entries need correction, please e-mail
me at "aldis@peg.pegasus.oz.au" or
"aldis@kralizec.zeta.org.au", for incorporation in future
editions of this list.

  Your Plan file is printed to a person's screen when  they  FINGER  your  ac-
  count.  It can be left empty, or filled with whatever information you desire
  to give out about yourself to the other Members  of  MindVox.   Some  people
  cannot  stay  serious  for more than a sentence or two, while others want to
  use this space to let people know something about who they are and what they
  do.   As with most things, there are no rules regarding what you can or can-
  not put into your Plan file, but we'd ask that you try not to fill it with a
  lot  of obscenities or control-codes that make people's terminals do strange
  things.  A lot of people don't deal well with this type of thing, and  while
  we  really  couldn't  care  less either way, if enough people complain about
  you, we'll do something really harsh like ask you to change it because other
