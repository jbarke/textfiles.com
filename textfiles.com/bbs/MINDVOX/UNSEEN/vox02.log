                     Welcome to the ThoughtScape of MindVox

  Since you have arrived at this nexus point within Cyberspace, you presumably
  have at least a basic idea of what we are, and what you expect to find here.
  You may have read an article by or about one -- or some --  of  us,  seen  a
  clip,  attended  a  conference,  or just taken a spin through the electronic
  landscape to see what fate had in mind.

  Whatever has brought you here, you want to find ...something.  It  might  be
  as  simple as the latest stock quote or a piece of shareware, or it could be
  as complex and all-encompassing as trying to give your life some  new  level
  of understanding that allows you to find peace of mind.

  Chances are that for most of you, what you desire lies somewhere between the
  two  absolutes delineated by NeW WaReZ and online therapy.  Although MindVox
  is suitably equipped to supply just about anything you may desire, it's pri-
  mary focal point isn't shareware, or junk that can be found on ftp sites and
  PC boards spread throughout the land.

  MindVox is a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to a wide variety of topics,
-- more --                   and  contains a vast collection of archives that house information on every-
  thing from software updates, viruses, security news, drug information, legal
  issues  effecting  Cyberspace,  and electronic digests and anthologies . . .
  all the way to a constantly growing library that chronicles the very  incep-
  tions  of  Cyberspace, with timeslices of systems dating all the way back to
  1979 -- the first bulletin boards ever to exist.

  MindVox runs on pretty complex, custom software  that  makes  everything  as
  easy to use as possible.  The system itself is in a constant state of change
  as we make improvements, implement your suggestions, fix  problems  stemming
  from  complaints,  and generally evolve the state-of-the-art in online tech-
  nology.

  We're running on an expensive collection  of  hi-tech  toys,  with  a  lotta
  modems,  workstations,  hard  disks, terminal servers and bandwidth.  We are
  BeTTeR, NeWER, FLASHIER, SHinY, BrIGHT and Cheaper ThaN almost  anything  on
  earth, or in outer space for that matter.

  Although this is really neato, our long-term goal is to move everything onto
  an  MSDOS  based  machine, purchase a big house in the suburbs, and fill the
  basement with roughly a hundred 386s and a real big air conditioner.

-- more --                   The closest tangible structure that  MindVox  could  be  likened  to,  is  a
  sprawling  Tavern  at  the crossroads of the entire world.  Whether you have
  jacked into Vox by dialing a local number with your modem,  or  stacked  to-
  gether  a  web  of net connections that spans the world, you have arrived --
  and while you might make use of the facilities provided, chances are  you're
  not here 'cuz you want to flip through an online multimedia encyclopedia, or
  because you're on a quest for that elusive copy of  MegaTerminal  92.7Y  NOW
  SUPPORTING NEON ANSI MODE and V.FAST!

  You're here because you want to interact with people that you won't find  on
  any  other  system  --  pioneers in the fields of computer science, science-
  fiction, music, the arts, religion, altered states, and future realities  --
  writers,  musicians, artists, programmers, designers, directors, actors, en-
  trepreneurs,  business-people,  politicians,  chemists,  body-builders,  and
  Elvis.

  You're bored with the cookie-cutter tract houses that litter the  electronic
  landscape  with  copies  of  copies.  All featuring the same thing, with the
  same environment and the same people.  Your cruise  through  the  Datasphere
  has brought you to our gates because it's more interesting to hang out in an
  experimental theatre, recording studio, occult bookstore, headshop, R&D  lab
  or  club,  with  people you read about; than a 7-11, with people you're sick
-- more --                   and tired of.

  Technology has created one of the most unique possibilities in  the  history
  of  human interaction; Anytown USA can jack into Haight-Ashbury in the 60's,
  Soho in the 70's, any place or time that has ever been and places that never
  were and exist only by mutual wish-fulfilment . . .

                   MindVox is a celebration of possibilities

                     Jack In, Rock Out and Feed your Head!

Setting  the  proper  terminal  emulation  can  greatly simplify  your  online
existence.   The  two most  common  selections  are  VT100  and ANSI.  In fact
these settings are SO  common, that if your terminal  program doesn't  support
them, you either  have a  REALLY  old machine, a  REALLY bad terminal program,
or are  calling into  MindVox via  Intergalactic relay from  Alpha Centuri. If
your  communications  software  doesn't  support  terminal  emulation, specify
it as "unknown".

Hi,
I made this account about three days ago.  Hope everything is okay with my 
credit card.  I looked it up and [CENSORED]

Am having trouble connecting.  Is there a specific connect command string
(i.e. on GEnie "HHH" upon connect, on CServe "Control C", etc.)?
Also, would like detailed info on how to connect to your system through the
SprintNET.  I already know about the @D and d1, etc.  What is your C 
address, please ?  :)  Can't afford too many ld calls to NY.  Am in CA,
you know and believe $2/hour will be easier on my cheque book.

                     Welcome to the ThoughtScape of MindVox

  Since you have arrived at this nexus point within Cyberspace, you presumably
  have at least a basic idea of what we are, and what you expect to find here.
  You may have read an article by or about one -- or some --  of  us,  seen  a
  clip,  attended  a  conference,  or just taken a spin through the electronic
  landscape to see what fate had in mind.

  Whatever has brought you here, you want to find ...something.  It  might  be
  as  simple as the latest stock quote or a piece of shareware, or it could be
  as complex and all-encompassing as trying to give your life some  new  level
  of understanding that allows you to find peace of mind.

  Chances are that for most of you, what you desire lies somewhere between the
  two  absolutes delineated by NeW WaReZ and online therapy.  Although MindVox
  is suitably equipped to supply just about anything you may desire, it's pri-
  mary focal point isn't shareware, or junk that can be found on ftp sites and
  PC boards spread throughout the land.

  MindVox is a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to a wide variety of topics,

[;H[2J
                        MindVox [HELP: FORUMS] Reference

  The MindVox Forums are divided into AREAS and FORUMS.  AREAS refer to a com-
  mon  "umbrella"  of related topics, for example:  CYBERSPACE is an AREA that
  encompasses many individual FORUMS that somehow pertain to the central theme
  of CYBERSPACE.

  To move through the various AREAS you can either use the GO command and type
  out their full or partial names, or make use of the ">" and "<" keys to move
  up or down the MindVox AREAS respectively.

  To do the same thing with FORUMS you may also use the GO command, or the "+"
  and "-" keys to move back and forth through the Forums or Newsgroups.


                               -=[> Commands <]=-

  When you are reading the various messages that comprise the MindVox  Forums,
  you  are  in a separate sub-section of MindVox where a different set of com-
  mands is active.  This is similar to the ARCHIVES, HOME,  MAIL,  STATUS  and
  other sub-menus.
-- more --                   However, there are certain FORUM commands that will work  from  the  central
  MindVox menu.  These include: ABOUT, GO, NEW and UNJOIN.  A detailed listing
  of the Forum commands follows.

  ABOUT     -

  About will present you with a listing that tells you ABOUT  the  Forum  that
  you are presently in.  If you want information about any particular Forum on
  MindVox, supply it in the form of an argument.

     For example: ABOUT UNIX

  Would cause MindVox to pattern-match "UNIX" and read  the  information  file
  about  the  Area: Computers  Forums: Unix.  If you would like information on
  ALL available MindVox Forums, then use the command:  ABOUT ALL

  Note that About ONLY works on MindVox Forums,  it  does  absolutely  nothing
  when you query it about Newsgroups.

  AGAIN     -

-- more --                   Again re-reads the message that you have just read.  It simply means "I want
  to read this message AGAIN!"

  BACK      -

  Go BACKwards and read the previous message.  If there is  no  previous  mes-
  sage, BACK will act as AGAIN and re-read the current message.

  CANCEL    -

  The CANCEL command is used to delete a message that you  have  posted.   You
  can  only  remove  messages  that have been posted from your account.  Other
  people's messages will not be effected by invoking this command.  See  also: 
  POST

  CATCH     -

  Catch is used to mark all the messages in the Forum or  Newsgroup  that  you
  are  presently  in,  as having been read.  This is useful if a section has a
  lot of new messages and you want to reset your NEWscan so that it thinks you
  have  already  seen  all  of  them.  This is especially handy in some of the
  high-traffic Usenet Newsgroups and MindVox Forums.  It can be  essential  if
-- more --                   you  don't  call  very  often and JOINed a lot of different Forums and News-
  groups.

  DOWNLOAD  -

  Download is used to download the current message with whatever protocol  you
  have  selected in STATUS (X, Y, Z modem, or Kermit).  Normally you would not
  want to download short messages, because its not worth  the  hassle  if  you
  just  want  to  read  a  few  paragraphs.   However,  many  people belong to
  mailing-lists or receive electronic journals or digests through the net  and
  these  can  be quite lengthy.  The download feature is implemented primarily
  for this purpose.

  FOLLOW    -

  This command allows you to FOLLOW-up on a message or letter, including quot-
  ed text within your reply.  This can help a great deal if you need to estab-
  lish context.  MANY messages travel strange and arduous routes  before  set-
  tling into a Newsgroup or mailing-list, and if you send mail to someone ask-
  ing about some message they posted last month . . . they might have no  idea
  what  you're  talking  about  if you don't include a piece of the message to
  remind them!
-- more --                      For example:  [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: FOLLOW

  Although FOLLOW assumes that the intended recipient is also  the  author  of
  the message or letter, an address other than that of the original sender can
  be specified.  For example you may want to comment  on  something  you  have
  just  seen posted somewhere and send along an example of what you're talking
  about.

     For example: [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: FOLLOW eric@clapton.com  Would  allow
  you  to  include quotes from message #42 to eric, even if message #42 wasn't
  from eric.

  Multiple addresses can also be specified.

     For  example:   [Return]  1-42,  [Q]uit:  FOLLOW  eric@clapton.com,  tuc,
  dave@hamster.org   Would  send  mail  to eric and dave at the Internet sites
  clapton.com and hamster.org, respectively, and to the MindVox  Member  named
  Tuc.  See also:  FORWARD, POST

  FORWARD   -

-- more --                   Forward works in a way that is similar to FOLLOW but instead of allowing the
  insertion  of  quoted  text into the body of your message, it simply sends a
  verbatim copy of the message or letter to the recipient(s) you want to  send
  copies to.  Forward the mail command has NOTHING to do with FORWARD files in
  the HOME section of MindVox.  See also:  FOLLOW, POST

  GO        -

  The GO command is used to move to another Forum or Newsgroup.  You  can  ei-
  ther  type its complete name, or just a few characters.  Based upon how much
  information you have provided, MindVox will do its best to pattern-match the
  text to the Area you want to enter.  You do not have to be JOINed to a Forum
  or Newsgroup in order to GO there.

  INDEX     -

  Prints a complete listing of the available Forums or Newgroups, depending on
  which section you are presently in.  This is identical to the main menu com-
  mands VOXLIST and USELIST respectively.

  LIST      -

-- more --                   The LIST command prints the last couple of messages that have been posted to
  the Forum or Newsgroup that you are in.  It can be supplied with an argument
  in the form of a number.

     For example: LIST 30

  Would list the last 30 messages.  You can also LIST by AUTHOR  or  ORGANIZA-
  TION, although in the Forums or Newsgroups LIST defaults to SUBJECT.

  MAIL      -

  Identical to the SEND command in MAIL.

  NEW       -

  The NEW command is used to do a scan for New messages in the MindVox  Forums
  and  Usenet  Newsgroups  that you have asked to be JOINed to.  It only scans
  for new messages in the areas that you want to read, it will  not  find  new
  messages in sections you have not told MindVox you wish to be JOINed to.

  POST      -

-- more --                   POST is used to enter a new message to one of the Forums.  You will be asked
  if  you  want  to continue with the current Subject, or select a new one; if
  you are posting to a Usenet Newsgroup you may also  be  asked  a  series  of
  questions  regarding  distribution,  cross-posting, and queries that pertain
  exclusively to the Usenet NEWS software.

  After supplying the required Subject information, you will  be  placed  into
  the  editor you have configured using the STATUS command from the main Mind-
  Vox menu.  See also:  CANCEL

  QUIT      -

  Quit from the Forums or Newsgroups and exit back to the central menu.

  SEARCH    -

  Allows you to do a SEARCH on the current Forum you are in.  You  may  search
  by  AUTHOR,  KEYWORDS, or SUBJECT.  This command is useful if there are hun-
  dreds or thousands of messages in an Area, and you are looking for  messages
  that  pertain  to some specific piece of information, or have been posted by
  one particular person.

-- more --                   (Un)JOIN  -

  Typing JOIN on a Newsgroup that you already JOINed, serves as  a  toggle  to
  UN-JOIN it and remove it from your NEWscan.

  WRITE     -

  Write will save the current letter or message into   a  file  in  your  HOME
  directory.  If the file already exists, then the current message will be ap-
  pended to the file.

  For example:   [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: write

                 [Appended to file /member/messages]

  Would append the current message to the end of your mailbox.  You  can  also
  specify a filename, for example:  [Return] 1-42, [Q]uit: write cars.forsale

                 [Written to file: /member/cars.forsale]

  As you may or may not have noticed, all text that pertains to  your  account
  ends  up  in  your HOME directory in one form or another.  You can load your
-- more --                   mail into editors, send it to other places, or sort it  all  out  using  the
  tools  provided in your HOME area.  You can also MAIL files that you edit or
  download from that section, or WRITE from the Forums or Newsgroups.

  The Bandwidth Forum is here to discuss all those things that just don't  fit
  into  the  topic-oriented forums. Like, for example, a discussion of hot new
  silicon might naturally lead some of you to a discussion of who has had sil-
  icone  injections.  Bring  it over here when it gets off-topic; there are no
  off-topic topics in Bandwidth. Also, this will be the place  where  you  can
  begin  discussions  on  one subject and have them branch out in billions and
  billions of directions. Who knows that path it'll take?  Join  in  and  help
  figure it out.
