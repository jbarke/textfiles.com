                 ANCIENT CITY FOUND, IRRADIATED FROM ATOMIC BLAST

                       Radiation still so intense, the area
                                is highly dangerous

       A heavy layer  of  radioactive  ash  in  Rajasthan,  India, covers a
       three-square mile area, ten miles  west  of Jodhpur.  Scientists are
       investigating the site, where a housing development was being built.

       For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate
       of birth defects  and  cancer  in the area under construction.   The
       levels of radiation  there have registered so high on investigators'
       gauges that the Indian government has now cordoned off the region.

       Scientists have unearthed an ancient  city  where  evidence shows an
       atomic blast dating back thousands of years, from  8,000  to  12,000
       years, destroyed most  of  the buildings and probably a half-million
       people.

       One researcher estimates that the  nuclear  bomb  used was about the
       size of the ones dropped on Japan in 1945.

       The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast  that  rocked
       the continent.

               "A single  projectile  charged  with  all  the  power in the
                Universe...An incandescent  column  of  smoke  and flame as
                bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all its splendor...it was an
                unknown weapon,  an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic  messenger
                of death which reduced to ashes an entire race.

               "The corpses  were so burned as to be unrecognizable.  Their
                hair and nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent
                cause, and the birds turned white.

               "After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected.  To escape
                from this  fire, the soldiers  threw  themselves  into  the
                river."

                               A HISTORIAN COMMENTS

       Historian Kisari Mohan  Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings are
       full of such descriptions, which  sound  like  an  atomic  blast  as
       experienced in Hiroshima  and Nagasaki.  He says references  mention
       fighting sky chariots  and  final  weapons.   An  ancient  battle is
       described in the Drona Parva, a section of the Mahabharata.

               "The passage  tells  of combat  where  explosions  of  final
                weapons decimate entire armies, causing crowds  of warriors
                with steeds and elephants and weapons to be carried away as
                if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.

               "Instead of   mushroom   clouds,   the  writer  describes  a
                perpendicular explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as
                consecutive openings of giant parasols.  There are comments
                about the contamination of  food  and people's hair falling
                out."

                 ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION PROVIDES INFORMATION

       Archeologist Francis Taylor  says  that  etchings   in  some  nearby
       temples he has  managed  to translate suggest that they prayed to be
       spared from the great light that was coming to lay ruin to the city.

               "It's so mid-boggling to imagine that some civilization had
                nuclear technology before we did.

               "The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian
                records that describe atomic warfare."

       Construction has halted while the  five  member  team  conducts  the
       investigation.  The foreman  of  the  project  is Lee  Hundley,  who
       pioneered the investigation  after  the  high level of radiation was
       discovered.
