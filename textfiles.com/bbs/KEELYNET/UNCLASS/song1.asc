                **********     Hi KeelyNet Users     *********

     This might be a bit cornball, but Bette Midler has a song out called
      "From a Distance" which is so inspiring that I took down the words.
     It is not only interesting for the words but also the concept of how
                     resolution "declines" with distance.

   Analysis of others and their actions tends to bring out TOO MANY DETAILS
       which invariably lead to judging others against your own beliefs.

    This in turn leads to loss of friendship, distrust or malicious gossip.

    We can all learn something from this song, although machines, processes
                and techniques REQUIRE ANALYSIS, PEOPLE DO NOT.

       The concept of AGAPE (unquestioning love) is difficult to REALIZE
               in real life, but we can partially achieve it through
       NON-ANALYSIS of our friendships or the behaviour of our friends.

          Don't blow your friendships through constant searching into
        the motivations and actions of others, ACCEPT THEM AS THEY ARE!

              Keely teaches us to YIELD to the divine force which
                      flows through all living creatures.
              Do not suppress divinely inspired actions under the
      mistaken guidance of mental ideas of what you THINK might be right.

      Continual SUPPRESSION of these divine tuggings will lead to LATENCY
                or DEADENING to the influences of the divinity.

                           DO what is in your heart.

         It sometimes seems that our efforts here at Vangard Sciences
                         are not making a difference.
              That attitude changes when we get E-mail telling us
         how someone was inspired by one or more text files on KeelyNet,
                   we urge you to don't just think about it,

                              B U I L D    I T !

         As we all age and look back over WHAT HAVE WE ACCOMPLISHED??
              It seems to be damned little in the way of reality,
            by that I mean working machines that ANYONE can build.

         To that end, we promise that for the year of 1991 and beyond,
         we will do all in our power to provide detailed instructions
                    for electronic and mechanical circuits
      that you too may become actively involved in changing the paradigm.
           You will benefit from our experiments and we from yours.

                   Not only will your understanding improve,
   but through your sharing with us of your experiences, we will all learn.

                                From a Distance
                        the world looks blue and green
                     and the smoke capped mountains white

                                From a Distance
                          the ocean meets the stream
                         and the eagle takes to flight

                                From a Distance
                               there is harmony
                        and it echoes through the land

                             its the voice of hope
                            its the voice of peace
                          its the voice of every man

                                From a Distance
                              we all have enough
                             and no one is in need
                             and there are no guns
                            no guns and no disease
                           no hungry mouths to feed

                                From a Distance
                              we are instruments
                           marching in a common plan
                             playing songs of hope
                            playing songs of peace
                         their the songs of every Man

                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                                from a distance

                                From a distance
                            you look like my friend
                           even though we are at war

                                From a distance
                           I just cannot comprehend
                         what all this fighting is for

                                From a distance
                               there is harmony
                        and it echoes through the land
                           and its the hope of hopes
                             its the love of loves
                          its the heart of every Man
                             its the hope of hope
                             its the love of loves
                        this is the hope of every Man

                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                                from a distance

                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                              God is watching us
                                from a distance
