--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

   No book for sale here was actually printed before 1501, but they all answer
to the description "rare and hermetic" - even the mass market paperbacks, not
to mention the xeroxes of unpiblished manuscripts, which cannot be obtained
from any other source!
   The symbol INCUNABULA was chosen for our company for it's shape-cocoon,egg-
like, gourd like-the shape of Chaos according to Chaung Tzu.  Cradle:
beginnings. Sleep: dreams. Silken white sheets of birth and death; books,
white pages, the cemetery of ideas.
   This catalogue has been put together with a purpose: to alert YOU to a vast
cover-up, a conspiracy so deep that no other researcher has yet become aware
of it (outside certain Intelligence circles,needless to say!) - and so
dangerous that the "winding sheet" imagery in our title seems quite
appropriate; we know of at least two murders so far in connection with this
material.
   Unlike other conspiracy theories,such as Hollow earth, Men In Black, cattle
mutilation, UFO, Reich & Tesla or what have you, the INCUNABULA Theory
harmonizes with genuine frontier quantum mechanics and chaos mathematics, and
does not depend on any quack nostrums,psuedoscience or ESP for proof. This
will become clear to anyone who takes the trouble to read the background
material we recommend and offer for sale.
   Because of the unprecedented nature of the INCUNABULA File we have included
short descriptions of some of the books, pamphlets, flyers, privately-
circulated or unpublished manuscripts, ephemera & curiosa available through
us.  Some of this is highly inflammable and sexual in nature, so an age
statement must be included with each order.

   Cash(or stamps) only.No cheques or money orders will be accepted.

   Thank You,

   Emory Cranston,Prop.

1.   Wolf, Fred Alan.  - Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds
     (New York, Simon & Schuster,1988) cloth; 351 pp.; $25

Written by a scientist for non-scientists, simplistic and jokey, makes you
feel a bit talked-down-to. Nevertheless Wolf uses his imagination (or other
scientists imaginations) so well he seems to hit accidentally on certain
truths-(unless he knows more than he reveals). For example: the parallel
universes must have all come into being simultaneously "at the begining" in
order for quantum uncertainty to exist, because there was no observer present
at the Big Bang, thus no way for the Wave Function to collapse and produce one
universe out of all the bubbles of possibility (p.174).  If an electron can
dissapear in one universe and appear in another (as suggested by the
Everett/Wheeler material), a process called "quantum tunneling", then perhaps
information can undergo a similar tunneling effect.  Wolf suggests (p. 176)
that this might account for certain "psychic phenomenon, altered states of
awareness", even ghosts and spirits!  Actual travel between worlds must of
course involve tunneling by both electrons AND information-any scientist would
have predicted as much-but the mention of "altered states" of consciousness is
extremely revealing! Elsewhere (p.204), Wolf speculates that a future "highly
developed...electronic form of biofeedback" will allow us to observe quantum
effects in the electrons of our own bodies, making the enhanced consciousness
and the body itself a "time machine" (which is what he calls a device for
travel between universes). He comes so close to the truth then shies away!
For instance (p.199) he points out that the Wave Function has a value BETWEEN
zero and one until it collapses.  If the wave function does not collapse, the
"thing" it describes exists in two universes simultaneously.  How strange of
him not to mention that fractal geometry also deals with values between zero
and one! As we know the secret of travel between worlds is rooted in the
marriage of quantum and chaos, particularly in the elusive mathematics of
fractal tesseracts (visualize a 4-dimension Mandelbrot Set-one of the simplest
of the trans-dimensional "maps" or "catastrophic topologies").  Wolf appears
so unaware of this ,we must sadly conclude that he's not part of the
conspiracy.
    Particularly interesting-and not found in any other material-are Wolf's
speculations about schizophrenia. Are schizophrenics recieving information
from other worlds? Could a schizoid observer actually observe (in the famous
double slit experiments) a wave becoming two particles and then one particle?
Or could such an observation be made by an extremely blank and simple-minded
watcher (a sort of zen simpleton perhaps)? If so, the perfect subject for
parellel-worlds experiments would be a paradoxically complex simpleton, a
"magnetized schizophrenic" who would be aware of the split into two worlds
which occurs when a quantum measurement is made. Oddly enough, such a mental
state sounds very close to the "positive schizophrenia" of certain extreme
psychedelic experiences as well as the meditation-visualization exercises of
actual travelers between worlds.
    Despite it's flaws, an essential work.

2.    Herbert, Nick. - Quantum Reality (NAL,1986) Cloth,$40

     A masterful and lucid exposition of the different versions of reality
logically describable from various interpretations of quantum mechanics. The
Everett/Wheeler Theory is here given it's clearest explanation possible in lay
persons terms, given the authors awwareness (at the time) of experimental
verification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.   ibid. - Faster Than Light:Superluminal Loopholes in Physics
             (NAL,1988) cloth,$30

       Some of the theorists who touch on the Many-Worlds "hypothesis" place
too much emphasis on time distortions and the implication of "time travel".
These of course seem present in the theorems, but in practice have turned
out (so far) to be of little consequance. Chaos Theory places much more
emphasis on the temporal directionality than most quantum theory (with such
exceptions as R. Feyman and his "arrow of time"), and offers strong evidence
for the past-present-future evolution that we actually experience.  As K.
Sohrawardi puts it, "the universe is in a state of Being, true, but that state
is not static in the way suggested by the concept of 'reversibility' in
Classical physics. The 'generosity' of Being, so to speak, is becoming, and
the result is not reversibility but multiplicity, the unmeasurable resonant
chaos-like fecundity of creation. "Nevertheless, Herberts second book is a
brilliant speculative work-and it led him directly to a certain circle of
scientists and body of research concerned with dimensional travel, rather than
"time travel", with the result that his third book (see next item) finally
struck paydirt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  "Jabir ibn Hayaan" (Nick Herbert). -  Alternate Dimensions
    (publication suppressed by Harper & Row,1989);bound uncorrected galleys,
     179pp.  $100. (We have 5 sets of proofs for sale,after which only xerox
     copies will be available at $125)

While working on _Faster_Than_Light_ Herbert came into contact with one of the
"travel cults" operating somewhere in California, perhaps one with a sufiistic
slant ("Jabir ibn Hayaan" was a famous 10th century sufi alchemist); according
to the preface of _Alternate_Dimensions_, which is irritatingly vague and
suggestive, this group seems to have trained him and sent him on at least one
trip to America2. Herbert suggests that he already had so much experience of
altered states of consciousness and ability to visualize complex space/time
geometries that only a minimum of "initiatic" training proved necessary.
    In any case, despite it's vagueness and brevity, this book is the most
accurate and thoroughly-informed work on travel between worlds in our entire
collection. So far we have been unable to obtain and deep theoretical work,
and only a few papers dealing with practical aspects-but Herbert provides a
magnificent overview of the entire field. Written for the lay person, with his
usual clear and succint approach to theory, Herbert's is the first "popular"
study to make all the basic links: the Everett/Wheeler hypothesis, Bell's
Theorem, the E/R Bridge, fractal geometry and chaos math, cybernetically-
enhanced biofeedback, psychotropic and shamanic techniques, crystallography,
morphogenetic field theory, catastrophe topology,etc.
       Of course he's strongest in discussing the quantum aspects of travel,
less sure when dealing with the math outside his field,and most inspiring when
describing(pp.98-101) visualization techniques and "embodied ecstasy" (ex-
stasis, "standing outside" the body; hence embodied ecstasy paradoxically
describes the trans-dimensional experience).
      Herbert makes no claim to understand the traveling itself, and goes so
far as to suggest that even the (unnamed) pioneers who made the first
breakthroughs may not have completely understood the process, any more than
the inventor of the steam engine understood Classical physics(p.23). This
definitely ties in with what we know about the persons in question.
     Unfortunately the six illustrations promised in the table of contents are
not included in the galleys-one of them was a "Schematic for a Trans-
dimensional Express" which might be worth killing for! - and the publishers
claim that Herbert never supplied the illustrations. They refuse to say why
they suspended publication of _Alternate_Dimensions _ and in fact at first
denied ever having handled such a title!  Moreover Herbert has apparently
dropped out of sight; if he hasn't met with foul play, he may have returned
permanently to Earth2.
     We regret having to sell copies of a flawed book for such an outrageous
price; we'd like to publish a mass-market edition affordable by all-but if
Harper & Row ever find out what we're doing, we'll need the money for court
costs and lawyers' fees!  So get it while you can-this is THE indispensable
background work for understanding the Conspiracy.

5.   Thomsen, Dietrick E.   "A Knowing Universe Seeking to be Known"
     (Xerox offprint from _Science_News_,Vol.123,1983);$5

Unwittingly demonstrates the resonance between quantum reality theory and the
sufism of (for example) "the Greatest Shaykh" Ibn'Arabi, who discusses in his
_Bezels_of_Wisdom_ a saying attributed to God by Mohammad (but not in the
Koran): "I was a hidden treasure and I wanted (lit.'loved')to be known; so I
created the universe, that I might be known."

9.  (Anonymous).      Course Catalogue for 1978-79, Institute of Chaos Studies
    and Imaginal Yoga (no address); xerox of mimeographed flyer,7pp,$15

An in-house document from the Institute where the first breakthrough was
attained (probably in the late winter or early spring of 1979)-therefore,
although it makes no overt mention of Travel or the Egg, the catalogue is of
prime importance for an understanding of the intellectual and historical
background of the event.
     According to an unreliable source (see ESCAPE FROM EARTH PRIME!, #15 in
this list), the Institute was located somewhere in Dutchess County, New York,
where the founder and director, Dr. Kamadev Sohrawardi, was employed by IBM in
the 1960's, "dropped out" and began investigations into "consciousness
physics"; it is also claimed that Sohrawardi was a Bengali of mixed English,
Hindu and Moslem origin, descended from an old sufi family, and initiated into
Tantra.  All this disagrees with clues in other sources and is perhaps not to
be trusted.  Other groups take credit for Breakthrough, and Sohrawardi may
have been a fraud-but we're convinced that the catalogue is authentic and
Sohrawardi's claim the most certain.
    At first glance, the Catalogue appears an example of late-hippy/early -
New-Age pretentiousness. Thus there are courses in "Visions of Color & Light
in Sufi Meditation", "Inner Alchemy in Late Taoism", "Metaphysics of the
Ismaili 'Assassins'", "Imaginal Yoga & the Psychotopology of the Imagination",
"Hermetic & Neo-Pagan Studies", (apparently based on Golden Dawn teachings),
"Visualization Techniques in Javanese Sorcery", "Stairways to Heaven:Shamanic
Trance & the Mapping of Consciousness", "Stirner, Nietzsche & Stone age
Economy-An Examination of Non-Authoritarian Hunter/Gatherer Societies", and-
interestingly enough!- "Conspiracy Thoery".
    The "shamanic" course may have been a blind for research in psychotropic
drugs, including such exotica asahuasca (yage, harmaline), ibogaine,
yohimbine, Telepathine and Vitamin K, as well as the more standard
psyche-delicatessan of the late 70's.
     However, the Catalogue also contains amazing courses in frontier science,
any combination of which could have provided the key or final puzzle-bit to
the Breakthrough: apparently Sohrawardi taught or supervised most of them.
Thus "The Universe in a Grain of Sand" promised information on models of brain
activity, cybernetically-enhanced feedback, Sheldrake's morphogenetic field
theory, Rene' Thom's Catastrophic Theory as applied to consciousness, lucid-
dreaming research, John Lilly's work on "altered states" and other mind-
related topics.  Then in "Strange Attractors & the Mathematics of Chaos",
Sohrawardi discussed matters unknown outside of the margins of academia till
the mid-80's, and made the astounding prediction that Chaos in the macroscopic
world could somehow be found to mirror Uncertainty in the microscopic or
Quantum World, a truth still unrecognized in "official" scientific circles
today. He felt that n-dimensional strange attractors could be used to model
the quantum behavior of particles/waves, and that the "so-called collapse of
the wave function" could actually be mapped with certain bizzare ramifications
of Thom's catastrophic topology. Making references to work by Ilya Prigogine
which was still being circulated in private "preprint" or samizdat form at the
time, Sohrawardi suggests that "creative chaos" (as opposed to "deterministic"
or entropic chaos) provides the link that will unify Relativity, Quantum
Complexity and consciousness itself into a new science.
     Finally in his "Advanced Seminar on Many Worlds", he states baldly that
the alternative universes predicted by Relativity (Black Hole Theory) are the
same as the many worlds predicted by Quantum, are the same as fractal
dimensions revealed in Chaos! This one-page course description is the closest
thing we have to an explanation of why travel to other worlds actually works.
Hence the Catalogue is an indespensable document for the serious student of
the Conspiracy.

10.  Beckenstein,  J.-  "Black holes & Entropy",(xerox offprint from Physical
     Review, Vol.D7, 1973; 28pp), $15

An early (pre-Breakthrough) speculation with suggestive hints about quantum
and chaos-as-entropy- although no knowledge of actual Chaos Theory is
demonstrated. This paper was referred to in an in-house memo from the Inst.
for Chaos Studies & Imaginal Yoga, believed to have been composed by K.
Sohrawardi himself (see #9).

11.  Sohrawardi, Dr. Kamadev. - "Pholgiston & the Quantum Aether", (Offprint
     from the J. of Paranormal Physics, Vol .XXII, Bombay, 1966), $40

An early paper by Sohrawardi, flooded with wild speculations about quantum and
oriental spirituality, probably dating from the period when he was still
working for IBM, but making visits to Millbrook, nearby in Dutchess Co., and
participating in the rituals of the League of spiritual discovery under Dr.T
Leary, and the psychedelic yoga of Bill Haines' Sri Ram Ashram, which shared
Leary's headquarters on a local millionaires estate. The basic insight
concerns the identity of Everett/Wheeler's "many worlds" and the "other
worlds" of sufism, tantrik Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism. At the time,
Sohrawardi apparently believed he could "prove" this by reviving the long-dead
theories of phlogiston and aether in the light of quantum discoveries!
(Phlogiston Theory-based on the thinking of the sufi alchemist Jabir ibn
Hayaan-the original Jabir-was propounded seriously in the 18th century to
unify heat and light as "one thing".) Totally useless as science, this
metaphor nevertheless inspired Sohrawardi's later and genuinely important work
on alternate realities.

12.  ibid.  "Zero Work & Psychic Paleolithism", East Village Other, Vol. IV #4
     (Dec.1968); xerox reprint, single sheet 11 1/2 x 17  $5

Unfortuantely no scientific speculations, but a fascinating glimpse into the
political background of the inventor of Travel (or rather, one of the
inventors). Making reference to French Situationist and Dutch "Provo" ideas
which helped spark the "Events" and upheavals of Spring '68 all over Europe
and America, Sohrawardi looks forward to a world without "the alienating
prison of WORK", restored to the "oneness with Nature of the Old Stone Age"
and yet somehow based on "green technology and quantum weirdness."
     Wild and wooly as it is, this text nevertheless poses a fascinating
scientific question in the light of the author's later accomplishments-a
question still unanswered. All the "First Breakthroughs" we know of with any
degree of certainty (those in New York, California, and Java-the actual
sequence is unclear) without exception entered parallel worlds without human
inhabitants, virtual forest-worlds. Most science fiction predicated other
worlds almost like ours, populated by "us", with only a few slight
differences, worlds "close" to ours.  Instead-no people!  Why?
    Two possible explanations:
  (1) We cannot enter worlds containing "copies" of ourselves without causing
      paradox and violating the consistency principle of the "megaverse"-hence
      only wild (or feral) worlds are open to Travel.
  (2) Other worlds exist, in a sense, only as probabilities; in order to
      "become fully real" they must be observed. In effect,the parallel
      universes are observer-created, as soon as a traveller "arrives" in one
      of them.
Sohrawardi wanted a paleolithic world of endless forest, plentiful game and
gathering, virgin, empty but slightly haunted-therefore, that's what he got!
Either explanation raises problems in the light of what actually happened;
perhaps there is a third, as yet unsuspected.

This bizarre document, disguised as a brochure for a New Age health retreat,
reveals some interesting information about the activities of Sohrawardi's
group or a closely-associated group. A fairly accurate description of the Egg
is provided, as well as a believable account of the first (or one of the
first) Breakthroughs.  However, everthing else in the pamphlet is sheer
disinformation. The New Jersey Pine Barrens were never a center of alternate-
worlds research, and all the names in the text are false.  A non-existant
address is included. Nevertheless, highly valuable for background.

15.  Balcombe, Harold S. - Escape From Earth Prime! (Foursquare
     Press, Denver, Colo.,1986), Pb, $15

This-unfortunately!-is the book that blew the lid off the Conspiracy for the
first time. We say "unfortuantely" because ESCAPE!, to all appearances, is a
piece of unmitigated paranoid pulp tripe. Written in breathless ungrammatical
sub-Fortean prose, unfootnoted and nakedly sensationalistic, the book sank
without trace, ignored even by the kook-conspiracy fringe; we were able to buy
out unsold stock from the vanity press which published it, just before they
went out of business and stopped answering their mail.
     Balcombe (whom we've been unable to trace and who may have "vanished"),
is the author of one other book we've seen-but are not offering for sale-
called "Drug Lords from the Hollow Earth" (1984) in which he claims that the
CIA obtained LSD and cocaine from Dero-flying-saucer-nazis from beneath
Antarctica. So much for his credentials. How he got hold of even a bit of the
authentic Other Worlds story is a miracle.
    According to Balcombe,the first breakthrough was due not solely to K.
Soharawardi - despite his importance as a theoretician-but also a "sinister
webwork of cultists, anarchists, commies, fanatical hippies and renegade
traitor scientists who made fortunes in the drug trade"(p.3). Balcombe
promises to name names, and out of the welter of rant and slather, some hard
facts about the pioneers actually emerge.
   Funding (and some research) emanated in the 70's from a "chaos cabal" of
early Silicon Valley hackers interested in complex dynamical systems,
randomicity, and chance, and - gambling! - as well as a shadowy group of "drug
lords" (Balcombe's favorite term of abuse), with connections to certain
founders of the Discordian Illuminati.  Money was channelled through a cult
called the Moorish Orthodox Church, a loose knit confederation of jazz
musicians, oldtime hipsters, white "sufis" and black moslems, bikers and
street dealers (see" A Heresologist's Guide to Brooklyn", #24 in this list)
who came into contact with Sohrawardi in Millbrook in the mid-60's.
   Sohrawardi was a naive idealist and somewhat careless about his
associations. He received clandestine support from people who were in turn
connected to certain Intelligence circles with an interest in psychedelic and
fringe mind-science. According to Balcombe this was not the CIA (MK-ULTRA) but
an unofficial offshoot of several groups with Masonic connections! The
Conspiracy was penetrated almost from the start, but was actually encouraged
in the hope of gleaning useful information about parallel worlds, or at least
about the "mental conditioning techniques" developed as part of the basic
research.
   By the mid-70's, Sohrawardi and his various cohorts and connections (now
loosely referred to as "the Garden of Forked Paths" or GFP) had become aware
of the Intelligence circles (now loosely grouped as "Probability Control
Force" or PCF) and had in turn planted double-agents, and gone further
underground.  In 1978 or 79 an actual device for trans-dimensional Travel, the
"Egg" (also called the Cocoon or the Cucurbit, which means both gourd and
alchemical flask) was developed in deepest secrecy, probably at Sohrawardi's
institute in Upstate New York, certainly not at a branch lab supposedly hidden
away in the NJ Pine Barrens near the long-vanished village of Ong's Hat (see
#13 in this list), since no such lab ever existed, nor does it exist now,
despite what some fools think.
   The PCF were unable to obtain an Egg for several years and did not succeed
in Breakthrough until (Balcombe believes) 1982.  The California groups,
however, began Egg-production and broke through (into "BigSur2") in early 1980
(again, Balcombe's chronology).  (Balcombe clearly knows nothing of the
situation in Java.)
   It remains unclear whether the East Coast and West Coast groups both
entered the same alternate world, or two different but similar worlds.
Communication between the two outposts has so far proved impossible because,
as it happens, the Egg will not transport non-sentient matter. Travelers
arrive Over There birth-naked in a Stone Age world - no airplanes, no radio,
no clothes ... no fire and no tools! Only the Egg, like a diamond Faberge
easter gift designed by Dali, alone in the midst of "Nature naturing".
Balcombe includes a dim out-of-focus photo of an Egg, and claims that the
machine is part computer but also partly-living crystal, like virus or DNA,
and also partly "naked quantumstuff".
     Eggs are costly to produce, so the early pioneers had to return after
each sortie and forego permanent settlement on E2 until a cheaper mode of
transport could be discovered. However, emigration via the Egg proved possible
when the "tantrik" or "double-yolk" effect was discovered: two people (any
combination of age, gender, etc.) can Travel by Egg while making love,
especially if one of the pair has already done the trip a few times and "knows
the way" without elaborate visualization techniques and so forth. Balcombe has
a field day with this juicy information and spends an entire chapter (VIII)
detailing the "perversions" in use for this purpose.  Talent for Travel ranges
from brilliant to zero - probably no more than 15% of humanity can make it,
although the less-talented and even children can be "translated" by the
tantrik technique - and extensive training methods have somewhat improved the
odds. California2 now contains about 1000 emigrants scattered along the coast,
and the eastern settlements add up to 500 or 600. A few children have been
born "over there" - some can Travel, some can't, although the talented
percentage seems greater than among the general population of Earth-prime. And
being "stuck" on E2 is no grave punishment in any case!, unless you object to
the Garden of Eden and the "original leisure society" of the Paleolithic
flintknappers.
   Balcombe claims that the PCF was severely disappointed by the sentience
"law" of Travel, since they had hoped to use the parallel worlds as a weapons-
delivery system! Nevertheless they continued to experiment, hoping for a more
"mechanistic" technique; meanwhile they devote their efforts to
     (a) suppressing all information leaks,
     (b) plotting against the independent GFP and infiltrating the E2
         settlements,
     (c) attempting to open new worlds where technology might be possible.
They are however handicapped by a shortage of talent:the kind of person who
can Travel is not usually the kind of person who sympathizes with the
"patriotic discipline of the PCF" and rogue Masonic groups, but some of these
end up defecting and "doubling", and anyway most of them are much too weird
for the taste of the rigidly reactionary inner core of PCF leadership, who
wonder (as does Balcombe) whether these agents are "any better than the scum
they're spying on?"
   More worlds have been discovered - E3 and E4 are mentioned in ESCAPE!  (and
we know that E5 was opened in 1988) - but all of these are "empty" forest
worlds apparently almost identical with E2.
   In summary, Balcombe's style is execrable and attitude repulsive, but his
book remains the most accurate overview of the Conspiracy to date. If you're
only going to order one item from us, this is it.

16.   (Anonymous). "Bionic Travel: An Orgonomic Theory of the Megaverse",
       (xerox of unpubl. typescript headed "Top Secret Q Eyes Only";27pp),$15

If this paper emanates from PCF sources, as we believe, it indicates the poor
quality of original research carried out by the enemies of Sohrawardi and the
GFP, and may explain the PCF's relative lack of progress in the field
(especially considering their much larger budget!). The author attempts to
revive W. Reich's Orgone Theory, with "bions" as "life-force particles" and
some sort of orgone accumulator (Reich's "box") as a possible substitute for
the Egg.  An unhealthy interest is shown in "harnessing the force of Deadly
Orgone" as a weapon for use on other worlds. References are also made to
Aliester Crowley's "sex magick techniques" of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Even
speculations on human sacrifice as a possible source of "trans-dimensional
energy". A morbid and crackpot document, devoid of all scientific value (in
our opinion) but affording a fascinating insight into PCF mentality and
method.

17.  Corbin, Henry.   Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn'Arabi
     (trans. by R. Mannheim; Princeton, NJ, 1969), cloth, $50; Pb, $20

One of the few books mentioned by title in the Catalogue of the Inst. of Chaos
Studies & Imaginal Yoga (see #9 in this list). The "mundus imaginalis", also
called the World of Archetypes or the "Isthmus" (Arabic, barzakh), lies in
between the World of the Divine and the material World of Creation. It
actually consists of "many worlds", including two "emerald cities" called
Jabulsa and Jabulqa (very intriguing considering the situation on Java2!). The
great 14th century Hispano-Moorish sufi Ibn'Arabi developed a metaphysics of
the "Creative Imagination" by which the adept could achieve spiritual progress
via direct contemplation of the archetypes, including the domains of djinn,
spirits and angels. Ibn'Arabi also speaks of seven alternate Earths created by
Allah, each with its own Mecca and Kaaba! Some parallel universe theorists
believe that Travel without any tech (even the Egg) may be possible, claiming
that certain mystics have already accomplished it. If so, then Ibn'Arabi must
have been one of them.

18.  Gleick, James.  CHAOS: Making a New Science (Viking Penguin, NY, 1987),
     cloth, 254pp, $30

The first and still the most complete introduction to chaos, required reading
BUT with certain caveats. First: Gleick has no philosophical or poetic depth;
he actually begins the book with a quote from John Updike!  No mention of
chaos mythology or oriental sources. No mention of certain non-American chaos
scientists such as Rene Thom and Ilya Prigogine!  Instead, alongside the
admittedly useful info, one gets a subtle indoctrination in "deterministic
chaos", by which we mean the tendency to look on chaos as a weapon to fight
chaos, to "save" Classical physics - and learn to predict the Stock Market!
(As opposed to what we call the "quantum chaos" of Sohrawardi and his allies,
which looks on chaos as a creative and negentropic source, the cornucopia of
evolution and awareness.) Warning: we suspect Gleick of being a PCF agent who
has embedded his text with subtle disinformation meant to distract the
chaos-science community from any interest in "other worlds".

19.  Pak Hardjanto. "Apparent Collapse of the Wave Function as an n-
     Dimensional Catastrophe" (trans. by "N.N.S."in Collected Papers of the
     SE Asian Soc. for Advanced Research, Vol. XXIX, 1980), 47pp, xerox of
     offprint, $15

An early paper by the little-known scientific director of the Javanese "Travel
Cult" which succeeded in breakthrough, possibly in the year this essay was
published or shortly thereafter. Hardjanto is known to have been in touch with
Sohrawardi since the 60's; no doubt they shared all information, but each kept
the other secret from their respective organizations. The pioneers of Java2
became known to the GFP and PCF only around 1984 or 85.
   This article, the only scientific work we possess by Hardjanto, shows him
to be a theoretician equal or even superior to Sohrawardi himself - and if
Hardjanto is also the anonymous author of the following item, as we believe,
then he appears a formidable "metaphysicist" as well!
   "Apparent Collapse", while certainly not a blueprint for Egg construction,
nevertheless constitutes one of the few bits of "hard" science published
openly on our Subject. Unfortunately, its theorems and diagrams are doubtless
comprehensible only to a handful of experts. The topological drawings
literally boggle the mind, especially one entitled "Hypercube Undergoing
'Collapse' Into 5-Space Vortex"!

20.  (Unsigned, probably by Pak Hardjanto). A Vision of Hurqalya (trans. by
      K.K.Sardono; Incunabula Press, 1988), Pb, 46pp, $20

The Indonesian original of this text appeared as a pamphlet in Yogjakarta
(E.Java) in 1982. We ourselves at Incunabula commissioned the translation and
have published this handsome edition, including all the illustrations from the
original, at our own expense.
   If one knew nothing about the Conspiracy or Many-Worlds Theory, A Vision
would seem at first to be a mystical tract by an adherent of kebatinan, the
heterodox sufi-influenced freeform esoteric/syncretistic complex of sects
which has come to be influential in GFP circles, inasmuch as the idea of
"spiritual master" (guru, murshed) has been replaced by "teacher" (pamong);
some kebatinan sects utilize spontaneous non-hierarchical organizational
structures.
   However, in the light of our knowledge of the material existence of other
worlds, Vision takes on a whole new dimension - as a literal description of
what Hardjanto and his fellow pioneers found on Java2.
   They discovered another uninhabited world - but with one huge difference.
The author of Vision steps out of his "alchemical Egg" into a vast and ancient
abandoned City! He calls it Hurqalya (after a traditional sufi name for the
Other World or alam-e mithal). He senses his total aloneness - feels that the
City's builders have long since moved on elsewhere - and yet that they still
somehow, somewhere exist.
   The author compares Hurqalya to the ancient ruined city of Borobadur in E.
Java, but notices immediately that there are no statues or images - all the
decoration is abstract and severe - but "neither Islamic nor Buddhist nor
Hindu nor Christian nor any style I ever saw". The "palaces" of Hurqalya are
grand, cyclopaean, almost monolithic - far from "heavy" in atmosphere, despite
the black basalt from which they seem to have been carved. For the City is cut
through by water ... it is in fact a water-city in the style of the Royal
Enclave of Yogjakarta (now so sadly derelict) - but incomparably bigger.
Canals, aqueducts, rivers and channels crisscross and meander through the
City; flowing originally from quiescent volcanic mountains looming green in
the West, Water flows down through the City which is built on a steep slope
gradually curving into a basin and down to the placid Eastern Sea, where a
hundred channels flow dark and clear into the green salt ocean.
   Despite the air of ruin - huge trees have grown through buildings,
splitting them open - mosses, ferns and orchids coat the crumbling walls with
viridescence, hosting parrots, lizards, butterflies - despite this desolation,
most of the waterworks still flow: canal-locks broken open centuries ago allow
cascades, leaks, spills and waterfalls in unexpected places, so that the City
is wrapped in a tapestry of water-sounds and songbird voices. Most amazingly,
the water flows at different levels simultaneously, so that aqueducts cross
over canals which in turn flow above sunken streams which drip into wells,
underground cisterns and mysterious sewers in a bewildering complex of levels,
pipes, conduits and irrigated garden terraces which resemble (to judge by the
author's sketches) a dreamscape of Escher or Piranesi. Viewed from above, the
City would be mapped as an arabesque 3-D spederweb (with waterbridges
aboveground, streams at ground level and also underground) fanning out to fill
the area of the basin, thence into the harbor with its huge cracked
basalt-block docks.
   The slope on which the City is built is irregularly terraced in ancient SE
Asian style - as many staircases as streets thread their way up and down, laid
out seemingly at randowm, following land-contours rather than grid-logic,
adding to the architectural complexity of the layer of waterways with a maze
of vine-encrusted overpasses, arched bridges, spiralling ramps, crooked
alleyways, cracked hidden steps debouching on broad esplanades, avenues, parks
gone to seed, pavilions, balconies, apartments, jungle-choked palazzos,
echoing gloomy "temples" whose divinities, if any, seem to have left no
forwarding address ...  all empty, all utterly abandoned. And nowhere is there
any human debris - no broken tools, bones or midden heaps, no evidence of
actual habitation - as if the ancient builders of the City picked up and took
everything with them when they departed - "perhaps to one of the other Seven
Worlds of the alam-e mithal" - in other words, to a "higher dimension.
   Thus ends the Vision of Hurqalya - raising more questions than it answers!
There is no doubt that it describes exactly what was discovered in Java2 in
1980 or 81. But if the "observer-created" theory of other-worlds Travel is
true, "Hurqalya" represents the "imaginal imprint" of what Hardjanto (or
whoever) expected to find. Yet again, if that theory is false ... who built
Hurqalya? One current explanation (arising from time-distortion theorems which
have so far remained unsolvable) suggests that the Builders "moved" in
prehistoric times to Earth-prime and became the distant ancestors of the
Javanese ("Java Man"). Another guess: the Builders have indeed moved on to a
"distant" alternate universe, and eventually we may find them.
   A small settlement now exists in Hurqalya. Once the American groups heard
of the City's existence, members of both the GFP and PFC were able to
visualize it and Travel to it from America (the Javanese can do the same from
Java-prime to America2). Since 1985 all three groups have expanded most of
their exploratory effort on "opening up" new worlds in the Java series.
Apparently Indonesian sorcerers and trance adepts are very good at this, and
we believe they have reached Java7 - without, however, finding replications of
the City or any trace of the Builders - only more empty forest.

      Hell': Some Unexpected Properties of Cellular Automata in the Light of
      the Everett-Wheeler Hypothesis" (Complex Dynamical Systems Newsletter
      no. 8, 1989), offprint, $10

Who is this man and what does he know? No other serious mathematician has so
far made any connection between cellular automata and the Many Worlds. Tongue-
in-cheek (?), the author suggests that Schrodinger's poor cat might be both
alive and dead, even after the box is opened, IF parallel universes are
"stacked" in some arcane manner which he claims to be able to demonstrate with
a piece of software he has hacked and is selling for an outrageous sum; we
have also seen an ad for this program in a magazine called MONDO 2000,
published in Berkeley and devoted to "reality hacking". We'd love to know what
certain members of the Conspiracy would make of this bizarre concept!

     Experiments" (Psychedelic Monographs & Essays, Vol. XIV, no. 2, 1981,
     offprint, $5

This writer appears to have inside information. The notion of a drug-induced
hallucination so powerful it can be shared by many (in a proper "blind"
experiment) and can actually come into existence, into material reality; the
idea that drugPenhanced lucid dreaming can be used to discover objective
information from "other ontological levels of being"; and finally the
"prediction" that "a combination of these methods utilizing computer-aided
biofeedback monitoring devices" will actually make it possible to "visit
'other' worlds in 'inner' space" (which suggests that the author adheres to
the "observer-created" theory of parallel universes) - all this leads us to
believe that the author is probably a member of one of the California Travel
Cults - as well as an expert bruja!

23.  (Anonymous).  A Collection of Cult Pamphlets, Flyers, Ephemera & Curiosa
     from the Library of a Traveller (Looseleaf portfolio of photocopied
     originals) sold by lot,$25

The unknown compiler of this Collection (whom for convenience we'll call "X")
left it behind when he "vanished", whence it came into our possession. We know
something of the compiler's career from an untitled document written by him
and found with the Collection, which we call The Poetic Journal of a Traveller
(#24 in this list), as well as a pamphlet believed to be by the same author,
Folklore of the Other Worlds (#25).(The Ong's Hat Color Brochure was also
discovered in the same cache, and is sold by us as #13.)
   The Collection contains the following items:
   1) A History & Catechism of the Moorish Orthodox Church, which traces
      the origins of the sect to early (1913) American Black Islam, the
      "Wandering Bishops", the Beats of the 50s and the psychedelic churches
      movement of the 60s - deliberately vague about the 70s and 80s however.
   2) The World Congress of Free Religions, a brochure-manifesto arguing
      for a "fourth way", a non-authoritarian spiritual movement in opposition
      to mainstream, fundamentalist and New Age religion. The WCFR is said to
      include various sects of Discordians, SubGeniuses, Coptic Orthodox
      People of the Herb, gay ("faery") neo-pagans, Magical Judaism, the
      Egyptian Church of New Zealand, Kaos Kabal of London, Libertarian
      Congregationalists, etc. - and the Moorish Orthodox Church. Several of
      these sects are implicated in the Conspiracy, but no overt mention of
      the Travel Cults is made here.
   3) Spiritual Materialism, by "the New Catholic Church of the Pantarchy,
      Hochkapel von SS Max und Marx", a truly weird flyer dedicated to
      "Saints" Max Stirner and Karl Marx, representing a group claiming
      foundation by the 19th century Individualist Stephen Pearl Andrews, but
      more likely begun in the 1980s as a Travel Cult. Uses Nietzsche to
      contend that material reality itself constitutes a (or the) spiritual
      value and the principle of Infinity "which is expressed in the existence
      of many worlds." It argues for a utopia based on "individualism,
      telepathic socialism, free love, high tech, Stone Age wilderness and
      quantum weirdness"! No address is given, needless to say.
   4) The Sacred Jihad of Our Lady of Chaos, this otherwise untraceable
      group calls for "resistance to all attempts to control probability." It
      quotes Foucault and Baudrillard on the subject of "disappearance", then
      suggests that "to vanish without having to kill yourself may be the
      ultimate revolutionary act ... The monolith of Consensus Reality is
      riddled with quantum-chaos cracks ... Viral attack on all fronts!
      Victory to Chaos in every world!"
   5) The Temple of Antinous, a Travel Cult of pedophile boy-lovers and
      neo-pagans devoted to Eros and Ganymede. (Warning: this leaflet contains
      some just-barely-legal graphic material.) "Wistfully we wonder if the
      boygod can manifest only in some other world than this dreary
      puritanical polluted boobocracy - then, gleefully, we suddenly recall:
      there ARE other worlds!"
   6) A Collage, presumably made by X himself, consisting of a "mandala"
      constructed from cut-outs of Strange Attractors and various Catastrophic
      topologies interwoven with photos of young girls and boys clipped from
      Italian fashion magazines. Eroticizing the mathematical imagery no doubt
      helps one to remember and visualize it while operating the Egg.

24.   (Anonymous). Poetic Journal of a Traveller; or, A Heresologist's Guide
      to Brooklyn (Incunabula Press, pamphlet, $15. Believed to be by "X", the
      compiler of the Collection, & transcribed by us from manuscript.)

Apparently X began this MS with the intention of detailing his experiences
with a Travel Cult and eventual "translation" to the various alternate-world
settlements, but unfortunately abandoned the project early on, possibly due to
PCF interference.
   It begins with a summary account of X's spiritual quest, largely among the
stranger sects of his native Brooklyn: Santeria in Coney Island, Cabala in
Williamsburg, sufis on Atlantica Avenue, etc. He is disappointed or turned
away (and even mugged on one occasion). He becomes friendly with a Cuban woman
of mixed Spanish, black, amerindian and Chinese ancestry who runs a botanica
(magical supplies and herbs).  When he asks her about "other worlds", she is
evasive but promises to introduce him to someone who knows more about such
matters.
   She orders her grand-daughter, a 14-year-old named Teofila, to escort X
through the "rough neighborhoods" to the old man's shop. The girl is wearing a
t-shirt that says "Hyperborean Skateboarding Association", and indeed travels
by skateboard, "gliding on ahead of me like Hermes the Psychopomp." X is
clearly attracted to Teofila and becomes embarrassedly tongue-tied and
awkward.
   The old man, called "the Shaykh", who claims to be Sudanese but speaks
"pure Alabaman", runs a junk shop and wears a battered old Shriners fez. His
attitude toward X is severe at first, but X is enchanted by his rather
disjointed rambling and ranting - which reveal a surprisingly wide if erratic
reading in Persian poetry, the Bible, Meister Eckhardt, William Blake, Yoruba
mythology and quantum mechanics.  Leaving the girl in the shop, the old man
takes X into his back office, "crowded with wildly eclectic junk, naive
paintings, cheap orientalismo, HooDoo candles, jars of flower petals, and an
ornate potbellied stove, stoked up to cherryred, suffusing waves of drowsy
warmth."
   The Shaykh intimidates X into sharing a big pipe of hashish mixed with
amber and mescaline, then launches into a stream-of-consciousness attack on
"Babylon, the Imperium, the Con, the Big Lie that there's nowhere to go and
nothing to buy except their fifth-rate imitations of life, their bullshit
pie-in-the-sky religions, cold cults, cold cuts of self-mutilation I call 'em,
and woe to Jerusalem!"
   X, now "stoned to the gills", falls under the Shaykh's spell and bursts
into tears. At once the old man unbends, serves X a cup of tea "sweetblack as
Jamaica run and scented with cardamon", and begins to drop broad hints about
"a way out, not to some gnostic-never-land with the body gone like a fart in a
sandstorm, no brother, for the Unseen World is not just of the spirit but also
the flesh - Jabulsa and Jabulqa, Hyperborea, Hurqalya - they're as real as
Brooklyn but a damn sight prettier!"
   Late afternoon; X must return home before dark, and prepare to take leave
of the Shaykh - who gives him a few pamphlets and invites him to return. To
X's surprise, Teofila is still waiting outside the shop, and offers to escort
him to the subway. The girl is now in a friendlier mood and X less nervous.
They strike up a conversation, X asking about Hyperborea and Teofila
answering, "Yeah, I know where it is - I've been there."
   The main narrative ends here, but we have added some other poetic fragments
included with the original MS, despite the fact that they might offend some
readers, in light of the importance of the "tantrik technique" of other-world
Travel. (And let us remind you that a statement of age must be included with
every order from Incunabula Inc.). These rather pornographic fragments suggest
that X, too shy to attempt anything himself, was in fact seduced by Teofila,
and that his subsequent "training" for Egg-navigation consisted of numerous
"practice sessions for double-yolking" with a very enthusiastic young tutor.
   We believe that X subsequently made an extended visit to America2 and
Java2, that he returned to Earth-prime on some Intelligence or sabotage
mission for the GFP, that he composed a paper on Folklore of the Other Worlds
(see #25), that he and Teofila somehow came to the attention of PCF agents in
New York, aborted their mission and returned to Java2, where they presumably
now reside.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.   (Anonymous). Folklore of the Other Worlds (Incunabula Press, pamphlet,
      $15. By the same author as #24, transcribed by us from manuscript.)

Our anonymous Traveller from Brooklyn appears to have composed this little
treatise after his first extended stay in E2. It deals with tales of
Travellers and inhabitants of the other-world settlements, pioneers'
experiences and the like. Of great interest is the claim that ESP and other
paranormal abilities increase in the parallel universes, that the effect is
magnified by passing through the series of discovered "levels", and that a
small band of psychic researchers has therefore settled on Java7, the present
frontier world. The "temple" of Hurqalya (or whatever these vast buildings may
have been) are used for sessions of meditation, martial arts and psychic
experimentation. X claims that telepathy is now accepted as fact "over there,"
with strong evidence for telekinesis and perhaps even Egg-less Travel.
   Also intriguing are various accounts of "spirits" seen or sensed around the
settlements, were-animals supposedly glimpsed on higher levels, and legends
which have arisen concerning the lost Builders of Hurqalya. Something of a
cult has grown up around these hypothetical creatures who (it is said) are
"moving toward us even as we move toward them, through the dimensions, through
Time - perhaps backwards through Time"!
   X points out that this legend strikes an eerie resonance with "complex
conjugate wave theory" in quantum mechanics, which hypothesizes that the
"present" (the megaverse "now") is the result of the meeting of two infinite
quantum probabililty waves, one moving from past to future, the other moving
from future to past - that space/time is an interference effect of these two
waves - and that the many worlds are bubbles on this shoreline!

26.   Eliade, Mircea. Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Univ.of
      Chicago Press), Pb, $30

This "bible" of the modern neo-shamanic movement also served as a metaphorical
scripture for the pioneers of interdimensional consciousness physics and
alternate-world explorers. Not only does it contain innumerable practical
hints for the Traveller, as well as a spiritual ambience conducive to the
proper state of mind for Travel - it is also believed that Eliade's mythic
material on the prototypal Stone Age shamans who could physically and actually
visit other worlds, offers strong evidence for the possibility of Egg-less
Travel - which however so far remains in the realm of "folklore", speculation
and rumor.
