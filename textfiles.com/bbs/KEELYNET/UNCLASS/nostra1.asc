       The following is   an   outline  of  the  late  20th-century  events
       prophesied by the  16th-century   French  psychic  known  as  Michel
       Nostradamus.  Nostradamus has predicted in great detail  such events
       as the French Revevolution, World War I, Hitler's Rise and Fall, and
       even the Kennedy  Assassinations.   Nearly  two-thirds  of  all  his
       predictions have come true.  If two-thirds of this comes true, we're
       in for some trouble!  HBO produced  a  movie called "The Man Who Saw
       Tomorrow," which documents the life and predictions  of Nostradamus.
       These prophecies are based on and adapted from the book, NOSTRADAMUS
       PREDICTS THE END  OF THE WORLD by Rene Noorbergen, who wrote several
       books on psychics.

       I have drawn  on  a  world  map with  colored  markers  all  of  the
       invasions, nuke strikes, etc., with the number of each  event placed
       with the respective  arrows  and  circles on the map.  Print this up
       and save it, then compare Nostradamus's  predictions to actual world
       events.  You may be surprised!

           (1)    Communism  in  Russia  will  decline,  beginning  in  the
                  Ukraine as  a  result of trade differences with the West.
                  This will occur around Easter.

           (2)    The United States and Russia will become better friends.

           (3)    A great power will unify  the  Far  East with negotiation
                  and pressure.

           (4)    This power will disrupt peace attempts, and the Middle

                  and Far   Easterners   will   attempt   to  settle  their
                  differences with force.

           (5)    A meteor will strike  the  center  of  the  Indian Ocean,
                  causing tidal   waves  that  will  heavily   damage   the
                  surrounding lands.

           (6)    A  powerful  dictator  will dominate the Middle East.  He
                  will tyrranize   Syria,   Iraq,   and   Jordan.    [Maybe
                  Khomeini?]

           (7)    On  August  2nd,  1987 he will attack Iran,  Turkey,  and
                  Egypt with  an  army of nearly a million men.  [This date
                  was reached by astronomy;  the  astronomical  event  only
                  occurs on that day.]

           (8)    Arab  forces  in  Tunisia and Algeria and  north-Moroccan
                  guerillas will  invade Morocco's pro-Western monarchy and
                  overthrow its king.

           (9)    Israel will be defeated by the Arabs, with her airforce
                  destroyed.

           (10)   A  Libyan leader will  create  much  tension  in  Europe.
                  [Definitely Khadaffi.]

           (11)   A "red one" [a Cardinal of the Roman Church  or  maybe  a
                  TWA jet] will be taken by Arab terrorists at sea.

           (12)   The   Arabs   will   try  to  unify  more  of  Africa  by
                  overthrowing pro-Western   governments.    The   Oriental
                  leader will do the same.

           (13)   Arab armies will threaten central & southern Africa into
                  alliances favorable to the Middle-East.

           (14)   The Arab attacks in Turkey will be followed by attacks on
                  the Greek navy.  The U.S. will attempt  to  resupply  the
                  navy, but Cyprus will be lost to the Arabs.

           (15)   A series of tremendous earthquakes originating in Central
                  Asia will cause destruction throughout the warring Greece
                  and Turkey.

           (16)   Romania  and  Bulgaria  will  threaten war with the Arabs
                  when the Bosphorus Straits  are cut off, thus interfering
                  with commercial and military ship movements.

           (17)   The  U.S.  and  U.S.S.R.  will  form a military  alliance
                  against the  both  the  Far  Eastern power and the Arabs.
                  The U.S. will grow in fame,  praise, rule, and power, and
                  will even threaten the East with war.

           (18)   Geneva talks will fall apart, with the feeling that peace
                  is unattainable.  [Uh-oh here it comes.]

                              **   WORLD WAR ]I[   **

           (19)   China will launch a surprise nuclear biological-warfare

                                      Page 2





                  attack over  the  Arctic, affecting Scandinavia, Northern
                  Russia, Alaska,  and   Canada.    Another   attack   will
                  originate from a space vehicle 270 miles up.

           (20)   The Chinese will invade France by way of southern Russia,
                  conquering all in their path.

           (21)   The  Turks will sign a treaty with the  Chinese,  but  it
                  will be  broken  when  Arab  naval  forces  from  Tripoli
                  (Libya) attack the west coast of Turkey.

           (22)   The Chinese army will devastate  northeastern Turkey with
                  the aid of nukes.

           (23)   The  Arabs  and  Chinese  will  attack Greece  with  germ
                  warfare, which will affect the environment for 9 months.

           (24)   Albania,  China's  ally, will invade Greece in a surprise
                  attack using light armored vehicles.

           (25)   A  Western coordinated  counter-offensive  launched  from
                  Portugal will delay an amphibious assault  on  Yugoslavia
                  by [guess who].

           (26)   The Easterners will advance into Yugoslavia and unleash
                  bacteriological weapons   in   central  Italy  to  hinder
                  Western counter-attack efforts.

           (27)   Greece and Italy will be  attacked  simultaneously by the
                  Eastern forces.

           (28)   When  Yugoslavia is overrun, a devastating  drought  will
                  hit Italy.

           (29)   Italy  will dissolve into dissenting factions and go into
                  its own civil war.  The  Albanians  will  further promote
                  the civil war by paying off corrupt government officials.

           (30)   Eastern forces will attack Rome from Albania using aerial
                  bombardment and germ weapons.  They will  attack  Venice.
                  Central Mediterranean  islands will be evacuated, even as
                  far as Malta.  Venice will fall.

           (31)   The French fleet will be destroyed in the Adriatic Sea as
                  it tries to cut off the  Easterners  in  Italy from their
                  Albanian suppliers.  The French and Italian naval defeats
                  will keep food from reaching the starving Italians.

           (32)   The  Easterners  will  develop a new land/sea  weapon  to
                  attack coastal areas.

           (33)   The  Easterners control of the Po Valley from Venice will
                  give them  total  rule.    A  French/Italian  attempt  to
                  forstall Italy's fall will be crushed.

           (34)   In  order to avoid being wiped out, the French  commander
                  will withdraw  and  regroup  his soldiers along the Po in
                  the upper valley.

           (35)   England  will  partially  sink  as a result of geological
                  alterations and  cause  the  deaths  of  250,000  people.
                  [This event has been foreseen by at least  4 other famous
                  psychics, also.]

           (36)   An Easter earthquake will rip open an English temple.

           (37)   Around  New-Year's,  the  Easterners will begin a massive
                  invasion of the western  Italian  coast, southern France,
                  Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia by the use  of  nuclear and
                  germ weapons.  The French fleet will be obliterated.

           (38)   The  Papacy  will  leave  Rome  and  a  new  Pope will be
                  elected.

           (39)   The French armies will be cut off in Northern Italy.

           (40)   Prince Albert will be  kidnapped  in  North-Central Italy
                  after the French unsuccessfully try to cut Eastern supply
                  lines from Venice.

           (41)   The  French  will  again regroup their forces,  and  will
                  capture a beachhead.  This will be a turning point in the
                  Franco-Chinese war.

           (42)   Ill-timed  French-Italian  attacks will cause the loss of
                  Florence and Siena by  Eastern  nukes,  and Pavia will be
                  lost by the use of germ weapons.

           (43)   Monaco and Genoa will be annhilated by the Easterners.

           (44)   Ten assassins will be sent to murder the commander of the
                  French fleet, but they will fail and a  sea  battle  will
                  take place.   The  French will again lose their forces on
                  land and sea.

           (45)   A battle will be fought  at  the  major  French  port  of
                  Marseilles, creating   an  opening  through   which   the
                  attackers can  enter.   The  resulting massacre of nearly
                  half a  million  Frenchmen  will  make  people  flee  far
                  northward.

           (46)   Toulouse, Foix, and Narbonne will be taken.

           (47)   Bacteria will spread northward.

           (48)   Easterners will release deadly bacteria  from specialized
                  ships at   France's  port,  Agde.   Airforces  will  bomb
                  Switzerland and Germany.

           (49)   Extensive use of nuclear  and  germ  weapons will compose
                  the first phase of the Eastern offensive  against  all of
                  Europe, striking in France, Italy, and Spain.

           (50)   The   Chinese  will  attack  France  via  air,  sea,  and
                  mountain.

           (51)   The Easterners will invade  the  Balkans  to  cut off the
                  U.S.S.R.  from its Eastern European allies.

                                      Page 4





           (52)   A North-African fleet will enter the Black Sea and attack
                  Romania, Bulgaria, and southwestern Russia.

           (53)   A  Chinese/Arab assault from Morocco will attack southern
                  Spain with nukes.  This  will  be followed by an invasion
                  along the River Guadalquivir.  The invasion  will procede
                  northward, with  the  destruction  of Seville, Barcelona,
                  and Leon.  The Spanish will halt the advance for 7 months
                  at the River Ebro, but they will eventually be crushed.

           (54)   An  Allied  fleet  will   destroy  supply  bases  in  the
                  Cyclades, but  will  be  defeated  near Malta,  when  the
                  French lose Italy.

           (55)   Eastern   bombers  will  attack  deep  into  Europe  with
                  bacteriological weapons.

           (56)   Switzerland will fall by  the hand of the Easterners, who
                  will confiscate  the  gold  reserves and  impoverish  the
                  Swiss people.

           (57)   The  Easterners will start extensive bombing of central &
                  northern French cities  in preparation for a land attack.
                  The French  will  fly  in  defenses  beforehand,  though.
                  Central France will be overrun regardless.

           (58)   Paris  will be surrounded, and attempts to get Allied air
                  support will  be in vain.   Paris  will  surrender  after
                  Eastern forces find a weak spot in the defense, enter the
                  city, and engage in hand-to-hand combat.   The  surrender
                  will only  be a cover to organize a counter attack a week
                  later.  That will surprise  the  Easterners,  but they'll
                  drive the Parisians back into the city.  Over 300,000
                  will be killed or imprisoned.  Paris will  be  completely
                  defeated.

           (59)   A  British  taskforce  will  land in southwest France and
                  attempt to reach Paris, but will be stopped at Poitiers.

           (60)   The  British  will  reorganize  in  Canada  and  send  an
                  invasion force  to  establish  a  beachhead  on  France's
                  southwest coast.  With the aid of nukes, they march on to
                  Bordeax and  Toulouse.   The  British plan will be to cut
                  off occupied  Spain from  France  and  also  to  gain  an
                  opening into the Mediterranean.

           (61)   A  sudden  attack  from  the  Easterners  will  slaughter
                  British and  American  forces  and will allow the Chinese
                  leader a new command center, Carcassone.

           (62)   He will detontate a series  of  high-altitude, high-yield
                  atomic devices which will ignite the atmosphere and cause
                  a firestorme over southwest France, but  this  will  also
                  cause his own base to be destroyed.

           (63)   The  Scots, left on their island, deny Britain permission
                  to use their land for a  military  base, and seek Eastern
                  aid when  British forces invade out of desperation.   The
                  resulting battle will defeat the British.

           (64)   All  life in London will die out during winter as disease
                  sweeps what is now the city-island.

           (65)   Poland and East Germany will ally with the Easterners and
                  strike against  the  smaller  countries,  Czechoslovakia,
                  Hungary, Austria, and West Germany.

           (66)   West Germany and Austria will be invaded.  West Germany's
                  border will be split down the middle again.  Netherlands,
                  Belgium, and northern France will also be raided.

           (67)   At  the  same  time  of  the  German/Austrian  invasions,
                  Western forces will attack the Persian Gulf to weaken the
                  heart of the Middle East.

           (68)   German   leaders  will  cause  the  downfall  of  Central
                  European defenses, along  with  Eastern attacks from East
                  Germany and Yugoslavia.

           (69)   The  Allies  will  make  their last stand  at  Bruges  in
                  northwest Belgium.   The  Eastern  Forces  will  dominate
                  nearly all of Europe.

                       **   The Allies take the Offensive **

           (70)   Nuclear strikes will be  made against America and Russia,
                  and food will become in short supply.  The  U.S.  will be
                  forced into  economic  chaos,  with  looters  and rioters
                  raiding banks and shops for food, money, and supplies.

           (71)   A CONFLAG (Cluster Orbital Nuclear Fire-weapon for Light
                  Atmospere iGnition) system  will  be  launched from China
                  and detonated above New England, burning  as far south as
                  New York City.

           (72)   New   York   will  be  partially  destroyed  by  a  great
                  earthquake that will partially sink Manhattan island.

           (73)   The Orientals will attempt  to  invade  the U.S. near New
                  York, but the U.S. navy will easily repel  their  attack.
                  American Orientals   will   be   placed   in  "protective
                  custody."

           (74)   The Easterners will infiltrate  Latin  America and murder
                  the president of Brazil.  Their navy will attempt to take
                  the Panama  Canal,  but it will be unsuccessful  and  the
                  attacking force will be obliterated.

           (75)   The  U.S.  and  Russia  will  resort  to  germ warfare to
                  retalliate.

           (76)   The U.S.S.R. will be invaded  from  three directions, but
                  careful preparation  will  allow  them  to  use  chemical
                  weapons against the Chinese.

           (77)   To  prepare  to  attack  Asia, Eastern forces will set up
                  Pacific defenses.  They  will  entrap  a  U.S. fleet, but
                  Russia will  aid  the  encircled Americans  and  help  to
                  defeat the Chinese navy.

           (78)   The  American  Air Force will make bombing runs deep into
                  Europe.  Seven months later the U.S. and Russia will make
                  a joint  attack on China  that  will  last  a  full  week
                  without stopping.  The Eastern forces will be defeated in
                  their homeland, thus severely weakening their power.

           (79)   Scotland and London will be recaptured by  the Allies.  A
                  new Middle-Eastern  commander  will make his headquarters
                  in Rome.

           (80)   Scandinavia, the Baltic  states, and the Balkans will all
                  be attacked by the Allies.

           (81)   The British will liberate southwest France, which will be
                  reinforced by  other  Western armies.   The  allies  will
                  penetrate from   La  Rochelle  into  central  France,  to
                  Roanne.  Another invasion force will land near Calais and
                  slowly make its way to northeastern France.

           (82)   Central and Southern  France  will  be  liberated  as the
                  Allies continue to push onward.

           (83)   The Arabs and Far Easterners no longer  will  be  able to
                  work together  after the defeats in the Pacific, and this
                  weakens their still-resisting armies.

           (84)   Many battles will be fought  as  Allied forces make their
                  way to Marseilles, the Easterners' stronghold  and supply
                  port.  This  will be coordinated with a submarine assault
                  on southern France.

           (85)   French and British forces will seize the Spanish city of
                  Barcelona, and move on  to  aid  in the successful Allied
                  attack on Marseilles.

           (86)   Nice  will  be  retaken, but the Arabs will  attack  from
                  Spain and   Italy,  recapturing  parts  of  southern  and
                  southeastern France.   At  the  same time, the Arabs will
                  launch a  missile attack against the Allies  in  Northern
                  France.  This  attack will be unsuccessful, and the Arabs
                  will be driven back.

           (87)   The  Allies  will  use  bacteriological  weapons  against
                  Lausanne, Switzerland, forcing the Arabs to retreat.

           (88)   Spain will be reconquered after a large  naval  battle on
                  March 3rd, 1996.

           (89)   The  Allies  will  make  a  massive onslaught into Italy,
                  liberating it.  The Church will be returned to Rome.

           (90)   The Arabs will be forced  all  the way back into northern
                  Africa, but  a  French  force will be annihilated  as  it
                  tries to cross the Adriatic Sea.

           (91)   The Allies will attack the Mediterranean islands.

           (92)   A  secret  and  very  successful raid will be made by the
                  Allies to free POW's in Turkey.

           (93)   Southern  Arabia  will  be  nuked  by the Allies, but the
                  Arabs will  recapture  Sicily.   This  will  have  little
                  effect, though, and soon all of central  Europe  will  be
                  liberated.

           (94)   5000 Far Easterners will die when losing Crete and Greece
                  to the Allies.

           (95)   The French, under a new leader named Ogmios, will lead an
                  Allied assault  on Turkey between May 25th and June 21st,
                  1996.  The Arabs there will be defeated.  Northern Turkey
                  will be liberated on October 3rd.

           (96)   Western amphibious attacks  will fail, and Arab saboteurs
                  will destroy an Allied military base after  a  defeat  in
                  one battle.

           (97)   In  a surprise attack, the Western forces will attack and
                  defeat the Eastern navy.

           (98)   Allies will infiltrate  the  Middle  East,  stabbing into
                  occupied Israel, Syria, and Jordan.  Arab resistance will
                  disintegrate, and within a month the last Eastern forces,
                  in Central  and  South  America, will surrender.   Israel
                  will be liberated.

           (99)   The  Westerners  will  attack Middle Eastern positions in
                  India, defeating all.

           (100)  The desparate Arabs will  fight  3  last-ditch battles in
                  eastern Iran and Northeastern Turkey.   The  last  battle
                  will bring  about  the  collapse of the Arab empire.  The
                  Arab commander-in-chief   will   be  killed  in  his  own
                  headquarters.

           (101)  The battles will eventually cease in Iran,  and World War
                  ]I[ will finally be over.  The Allies win again!
