POPE JOHN PREDICTED

The following was e-mailed to JAY BROADGATE from Mary Ellen Gateley on
Prodigy. She heard it on a local radio program, and was kind enough to type it
in for those of us who listen strictly to the oldies station.

"Insight", a religious magazine of some sort, reprinted from The Manila
Bulletin where it originally appeared.  Editors note: The following is from
the diary of Pope John XXIII who reigned from 1958 - 1963.  This copy
was distributed by certain groups in several catholic churches in Metro Manila
in the Philippines.

The world will suffer through a painful time of violent wars, deadly famine,
and destructive natural disasters over the next 8 years. That nightmare will
be followed by a lengthy stretch of love and harmony, a beautiful serene
heaven on earth.  The startling predictions come from the sensational lost
diary of Pope John XXIII, beloved pontiff who died June 3, 1963.

The dusty leather-bound diary containing handwritten predictions was found by
a Vatican cleaning woman who was sorting through boxes stacked in a little-
used storage room.  The entries clearly spell out the assassination of
John F. Kennedy, America's plunge into the Viet Nam war, unrest in the Middle
East, and the fall of communism years before it took place.

Later entries call for even more troubled times.  Pope John had periodic
visits from both Jesus and the Virgin Mary, said a reverend who's pored over
the wondrous tales.  These sessions in the pope's chambers resulted in
fantastic glimpses into the future of mankind.  The pope was saddened to learn
that conditions will get much worse before they take a sudden, sensational
turn in the year 2000 that will return the world to its pristine beauty that
was here for Adam and Eve.

Pope John writes of heavenly visitors arriving by June of 1995 in flaming
chariots of steel.  The special visitors will arrive at the height of despair
and help man heal his wounds and work together to right all the horrible
wrongs.  Father D'Angelo, now 73 years old, has agreed to release some of the
diary entries made between February of 1959 and April of 1963.

The scrawled messages reveal a frightened and excited pontiff who decided to
keep his meetings with Christ and the Madonna a secret.  The first appearance
of Christ took place February 12, 1959.  Pope John notes: Dear God, I've
been blessed like no man before me.  The Savior has granted me special
audience here in my chambers.  He tells me that I have been chosen to hear the
truth no matter how awful it may be.  It scares me a bit to be so entrusted,
but I am honored all the same.  Jesus tells me that the Virgin Mary will come
soon to deliver the first news of what will be.

APRIL 7, 1959.  She is more beautiful that I had ever imagined.  The Madonna
is a joy to behold.  I just wish her message was a more positive one.  She
says that in 4 years' time the world will lose a great leader, and a powerful
nation will find itself involved in a conflict it cannot win.  The fighting
will take its toll on the battlefield and from within as the population
despises the loss of its young men. The Holy Mother sheds tears as she
describes the heartbreaking vision.

AUGUST 17, 1959.  The Madonna's second visit is much like the first.  She
speaks sadly of unrest in her homeland--a change in the balance of power, and
much blood being spilled in the sand.  She says several madmen will send their
people into battles in the name of God, but the Creator has nothing to do with
these senseless struggles among brothers.

JANUARY 3, 1960.  Christ comes to me again.  I yearn to tell my fellow
Christians of these miraculous appearances, but I am advised to keep quiet
until the time is right.  I cannot help but think I could perhaps head off
some of the trouble that looms for us all, but Christ tells me that misery
must take place for the master plan to succeed.

JUNE 13, 1960.  The Virgin Mary says the world will get a false sense of hope
30 years from now when the chains of repression are shattered throughout
eastern Europe.  The joy will be short lived, though, as the freed peoples
fight among themselves on how to run their countries.  Thousands of poor
innocent children will perish due to the foolishness of their fathers.

MARCH 6, 1961.  Just when I thought my heavenly visits were over, the Madonna
comes to me once again.  She seems tired of the heartache she must share with
me.  My heart aches to see him hurting so.  The news, again foreboding.  In
the early 1990's there will be a period of deadly natural disasters.  She says
paradise will be struck by powerful winds and wails, while killer floods and
violent earthquakes will shatter man's dwellings.  By the middle of the
decade, regional skirmishes will develop into full-fledged conflicts.  As the
casualties mount, world-wide famine will strike.  The devastation will be like
none ever seen, especially throughout Africa where millions will perish.

SEPTEMBER 22, 1961.  She has now returned with yet more bad news.  It is
becoming truly difficult for this humble servant to hear of such overwhelming
hardships.  The Madonna tells me terrifying diseases will be unleashed on the
already weakened population by late 1984.  Wars will begin to wind down
because the fighting will be greatly weakened from within.  This is the
beginning of the change.  Hallelujah!

MAY 19, 1962.  From the heavens will appear the saviors.  They will arrive on
June 5, 1995 and begin their task of assisting the clearing and repair of the
environment in the crippled countries. Many will fear these odd looking
beings, but they come in peace and will, with God's guidance, transform earth
from a charred spinning rock to a lush oasis in space.  The survivors will
flourish in a world without war, disease or hatred. My heart is finally at
peace with the knowledge that there is hope for humanity.

JULY 2, 1962.  The Madonna tells me this will be her final visit. It is a
joyous one, for she shares tremendous news. As the year 1998 arrives, our
heavenly friends will have shared much of their advanced knowledge.  Mankind
will at last wipe out most of its diseases and our life spans will increase
to the length of those listed in the Bible. The visitors will also share the
remarkable power of resurrection, and throngs of the wrongly-dead will rise
again.  Finally, a wondrous miracle will take place in the sky above New York
City on December 25, 2000, when millions will witness the sensational
appearance of a messiah who's going to announce the new beginning of a second
paradise here on earth.

Pope John XXIII died a year later, before he ever had a chance to release his
predictions.  Experts say the diary is 100% authentic, and they urge people to
prepare themselves for even leaner times before the new beginning, next
century.
