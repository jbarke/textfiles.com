                Communicating with the Dead using the principle of
                         Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)

       In a stunning  breakthrough, two different teams of researchers, one
       in the US and the other in Germany, have both developed devices that
       let them talk with the dead.

       So far, they are said to have actually  held  conversations  with at
       least nine "dead" people.

       Konstantin Raudive did  much original work in this  area  which  has
       been carried on  by  Dr. Walter Uphoff, George Meek and the Fishbach
       family of Germany.

       "This is undeniable proof that there  is life after death," declared
       Dr. Ernst Senkowski,  Professor of Physics at the Technical  College
       of Bingen, West Germany.

       "They have shown  us  wit,  personality,  memory and an active mind.
       They are as much 'alive' now as when they had physical bodies.

       Researcher George Meek, director  of  the  MetaScience Foundation in
       Franklin, N.C. says, "Our findings give us undeniable proof that the
       dead ARE TRYING to contact us."

       On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, researchers have found that the
       dead tell the same story: In the spirit world, there  is  no concept
       of time or  distance  and no need for food.  Spirits can observe the
       living and perform such feats as reading books without opening them.

       The electronic devices are similar  to  ham radios, except that they
       receive 13 different frequencies at once.  "The voices  of  the dead
       are about twice  the  speed  of  normal human speech and they have a
       rhythm that is different from our  own  -  almost  a flat monotone,"
       explained researcher Meek.

       And in Germany, Dr. Senkowski said that of the four dead people he's
       talked with, "one  is  a Hamburg dockmaster who died  in  1965.   We
       verified this information.  He told us that he was well and happy."

       "Another is a  Hamburg  steam engineer who died in 1959.  He told us
       to give greetings to his wife, calling  her by the special nickname,
       'Little Dwarf.'  And when we gave her the message,  she  told  us it
       was a very personal nickname known only to her and her husband.  She
       took it as  proof  that  the  person who contacted us was indeed her
       dead husband."

       The dead have given Dr. Senkowski  details of the afterlife, "I once
       tried to arrange a 3 PM conversation with one," he  said.   "He told
       me that was impossible because he had no concept of time or

                                      Page 1





       distance."  And one   day   Dr.   Senkowski   received   a   bizarre
       communication from a female spirit.   "I  was  wearing  a gold chain
       around my neck  rather  than  the  silver  one I usually  wear,"  he
       recalled.

       "Then suddenly a  young  women's  voice  spoke  through the machine.
       'There is a gold chain around your  neck  today - not a silver one',
       she said.  "I have been observing you."

       Meek's team developed   a  radio  based  system  which   they   call
       SPIRICOMM.  It used  a medium (psychically sensitive) with technical
       skills to operate  an  electronic   arrangement  which  produced  13
       simultaneous audio signals.

       The "departed" can somehow suppress those signals in  such a fashion
       as to generate  intelligible speech.  As the machine was being tuned
       for the best operation, the technician  was  being "guided" by voice
       from the other side.  A most interesting arrangement.

       One of the  spirits  Meek's  team  has  talked  to   some  25  times
       identifies himself as  Dr. George J. Mueller, an electrical engineer
       who died in 1967 of a heart attack.

       "Dr. Mueller told us where to find  his  birth and death certificate
       records.  He told  us  he graduated from Cornell University  with  a
       degree in Engineering and that he taught there," said Meek.

       Amazingly, according to  records  at  Cornell, what Mueller said was
       true.

       Dr. Mueller told the researchers  to  read  pages 66 and 67 from the
       book, "Introduction to Electronics" that he'd written  in 1947, said
       Meek, who found  that  'pages 66 and 67 were an overall view of what
       man had done and what he could do  in  electronics.   And it related
       directly to our breakthrough!  Dr. Mueller also told  us that in the
       spirit world each person can assume the outer appearance of any time
       in his or her life.'

       Dr. Mueller also  told  the  researchers  that he no longer felt any
       need for food, and that he could read any page that he wanted in any
       book just by looking through the book's  cover.   He told us that he
       was happy and we should not fear death, and that he  has  friends in
       the afterlife.

       And Dr. William  Tiller,  full  Professor  of  Material  Sciences at
       Stanford University and a Visiting  Professor  in  the Department of
       Electrical Engineering at  the  University of Delaware,  added,  "My
       feeling is that   this   development   should   start  a  series  of
       breakthroughs in afterlife research."

       Further information which we of Vangard  Sciences  found of interest
       was a comment made by a "departed" technician relating  to  how they
       can manipulate energy.

       Since there is  no  physical matter on their level, all they have to
       work with is energy.  By causing the  energy to flow in a vortex, it
       naturally achieves a focal point which allows action  to  occur from
       their level to our physical level.


                                      Page 2





       The technician stated  that they were still learning how to "tap the
       spiral" which shows  that  the  ever   tightening   spiral  segments
       increase in power as they condense toward the center or focal point.

       Mr. Meek's contacts  state  that  they  have  groups   (of  departed
       entities) some with  up  to 200 participants trying to help devise a
       reliable system for DIRECT COMMUNICATION.

       In a phone conversation with George  about 3 years ago, he said they
       were getting phenomenal information relating to a wide  range of new
       technologies.

       The last we  heard  was that MetaScience was working on a device for
       direct VISUAL INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION with the "dead".

       Two other excellent workers in this field are our friends Walter and
       Mary Jo Uphoff  with  the  New  Frontiers   Center.   They  have  an
       excellent newsletter and  travel  widely to keep up  on  the  latest
       research.

       Walter gave a  presentation  to  the  1988  7th  Int'l Psychotronics
       Association meeting in Georgia in  which  he  showed  videos of work
       done by the  Fishbachs  of  Germany.   These  showed  how  they  had
       actually received images on a TV screen from departed entities.

       In a private  conversation  with  Walter,  he graciously showed us a
       schematic of how the German video  system  is setup.  He kindly gave
       us a copy of the diagram with German labels which he translated.

                     Their telephone number is (608) 835-3795.

       Ron recently received  a short letter from Mary Jo Uphoff  informing
       us that Walter  had  taken  ill.  He was hospitalized at the time of
       the writing (June  90)  and not doing  too  well.   We  hope  Walter
       recovers as quickly and fully as possible.

       Mary Jo continues that the New Frontiers newsletter would be on hold
       for a short  while  until  Walter  gets  better.   Back  issues  are
       available however.

       If you would like to experiment in this area, we will provide a very
       basic description of how to do simple EVP work.

       The original discovery  came  when a naturalist in Europe was making
       magnetic tape recordings in a wooded  area.   When  playing the tape
       back, he heard strange high pitched whining, which, when amplified

                                      Page 3





       turned out to  be  almost  intelligible phrases in several different
       languages.

       Modern techniques developed by Konstantin Raudive use a regular tape
       recorder with a germanium diode as  the  ONLY  AUDIO  INPUT.  Take a
       1N914 germanium diode from Radio Shack and solder it  to a plug made
       to fit the MIC input.

       When plugged into  the  jack  and  the  volume  is  turned up to the
       highest it will go, the diode apparently  will pickup up a very wide
       range of frequencies.

       These frequencies are modulated by the "departed entities"  so  that
       careful listening to   the   playback   will   yield  some  form  of
       intelligible phrase.  Of course, there  are  several ways to enhance
       the intelligibility.

       These include slowing down the tape and various forms  of  filtering
       using an equalizer.

       This is the basis of the original EVP experiments.

       The unit MetaScience worked on went through several modifications of
       which we have  only  limited information at this time (Mark IV).  We
       know that 13 audio frequency generators (individually tuneable) were
       all powered on at the same time.

       As we understand it, the technician  must  be  sensitive to departed
       entities and can adjust (optimize) the precise frequency  (thus  the
       relationships) as guided  by  the entity whom he knows to be present
       and speaking.

       An outline of the MetaScience Spiricomm device follows :


                              13 separately tuneable
                                 audio oscillators

       We understand that there have been  improvements  with  the use of a
       carrier frequency in  the range of 47 MHz, but we  have  no  further
       data on this.  Please contact MetaScience directly for more info.

       Dr. Uphoff gave  us a diagram for visual imaging of the "dead" which
       is copied below :

       As we understand it, when the camera  is  turned  onto  the  TV  and
       continually recycled through  the  VCR, within about  50  passes  it
       begins to become sensitive to modulation by outside agencies.

       Pictures of Romi  Schneider (famous German actress), Albert Einstein
       and other entities,   including   many   family   members   of   the
       experimenters have appeared and been captured on  the  videotape  in
       the VCR.

       The experiment must  be  carried  out  under conditions conducive to
       minimal disturbances and not hostile to results.

       As we understand this, Keely referred  to  the establishment of what
       he termed a "Sensitized Centre".

       This was a stable geometric form, either in matter  or  energy which
       when so differentiated  (optimal energy transference) became subject
       to extremely small outside stimuli.   This  of  course  would be the
       nature of emanations radiated from "discarnate entities".
