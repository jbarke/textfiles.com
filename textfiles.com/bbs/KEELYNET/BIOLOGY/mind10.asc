                                 QUANTUM MAGIC

       REALITY AS DESCRIBED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS

       In quantum mechanics,  reality  is  described  by waves defining the
       probabilities of different  outcomes  from  the  same  interactions.
       These waves manifest  as what we have been taught  to  call  matter,
       energy, particles, and/or waves when observed.

       These probability waves   overlap   and   continue   forever.    The
       interactions between different    entities   constitute   a   single
       structure of linked wave patterns, so that the entire  universe  can
       be thought of  as  an unbroken whole.  The waves form a matrix, with
       all parts of the system affecting all other parts.

       Non-local relationships exist between  parts  of the system that are
       distant from each  other [1].  It is impossible to  distinguish  two
       particles of the same type in a region of space in which they may be
       found simultaneously [2].   Particles lose their individual identity
       in such regions.   Thus,  the  physical  universe  is  fundamentally
       unified.

       The basic equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is
       Schrodinger's Wave Equation  [2]:

                              2         2
         i h (p)Q /(p)t  = - h /2m Delta Q + V(x,y,z) Q


       satisfying the normalizing condition:

         Integral      2
         over all   |Q|  dx dy dx = 1
         space


                                      Page 1





       where:

              h = 6.63E-34 joule sec / (2 pi)

             pi = 3.14...

       V(x,y,z) = Potential energy, as a function of
                  coordinates x, y and z

              m = Mass

              t = Time

            (p) = Partial derivitive of
                                                  2
              Q = Wave function of the particle, where Q dx dy dz is
                  the probability that the particle may be found in the
                  volume element dx dy dz at a particular time.  Values
                  of Q are components of the "state vector."

       Values of Q  are  quantum mechanically defined states and constitute
       components of the  "state  vector."    These   quantum  mechanically
       defined states define  the  probabilities  of various  results  from
       quantum mechanically defined interactions [2].

       In one orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics, a system exists
       simultaneously in all quantum mechanically possible states until
       an observer (or   apparatus   outside   the   system)  interacts  to
       "collapse" the state vector" and obtain an observation.

       Quantum mechanical systems can go  from one configuration to another
       instantly, without passing  through any states in between.   Quantum
       mechanical movement is  discontinuous, with all actions occurring in
       discrete amounts (quanta).

       Schrodinger himself discovered   one   of  quantum  mechanics'  more
       distinctive features:  whenever    two   systems    interact,    the
       mathematical waves that represent the two systems do not separate
       but remain linked.  The link does not drop off with distance and
       the link acts instantaneously at both locations, but the specificity
       of the link  can  be diluted through interactions with other objects
       [7].

       WHAT UNDERLIES QUANTUM MECHANICS?

       There are lots of hypotheses on the nature of the underlying reality
       described statistically by quantum mechanics.

       o Some scientists are content with  the  hypothesis that there is no
         more subtle  structure  than  the probability waves  described  by
         quantum mechanics;  and  reality,  at  its most basic level, has a
         large amount  of randomness whose  limits  are  described  by  the
         quantum mechanical wave function, making the wave  function itself
         the fundamental reality.  This is called the probability doctrine.
         It asserts  that  such  indetermination  is a property inherent in
         nature and not merely a profession  of  our  temporary  ignorance,
         from which we expect to be relieved by a future  better  and  more
         complete theory  [2].


                                      Page 2





       o Einstein speculated  that there must be some underlying mechanism,
         some hidden variables,  that uniquely  determines  the  outcome of
         the interactions quantum theory can only statistically predict.

       o J.S. Bell showed mathematically that, if such a mechanism  exists,
         and the  math  of  quantum  mechanics  is strictly correct, hidden
         variables must  not  have  any   functional   dependence   on  the
         separation of events in space and time [3].

       o According to David Bohm, from both a consideration  of the meaning
         of the mathematical equations and from the results of experiments,
         particles can be understood as projections of a higher-dimensional
         reality.  This  reality  can  not be accounted for by any force of
         interaction between independent entities, but can be understood as
         a process  of  enfoldment  in a  higher  dimensional  space   [1].
         Information within the quantum wave determines the  outcome of the
         quantum process.    This   information   is   potentially   active
         everywhere but only actually active  when and where it enters into
         the energy  of an observed particle, implying that  all  particles
         have complex inner structures [10].

       o Recently, superstring  theory  has been proposed, describing a ten
         dimensional webwork of space-time  at  an  incredibly  small scale
         (1E-33 cm)  underlying the phenomenon described  statistically  by
         quantum mechanics, relatively, particle physics etc.

       Some scientists consider   speculation   about  the  nature  of  the
       underlying reality to  be  irrelevant,   since  the  predictions  of
       quantum mechanical equations match the statistics of  the results of
       experiments.  To the best of my knowledge, experiments have not been
       performed that unambiguously  distinguish  between these alternative
       world-views.

       On the other hand, experiments have  been proposed; and some work is
       underway to check   some   predictions   of   superstring    theory.
       Eventually, from the   results   of   experiments,   some  of  these
       hypotheses may be screened out and  others  elevated to the level of
       scientific theory.

       We are one and the same as the structures that underlie  the  matter
       and energy that  we  manifest  as; and that structure is continuous,
       interconnected, and non local in  nature.   Whatever  the underlying
       structure behind the  interconnected  wave  pattern   described   by
       quantum mechanics (if any), we are that.

       QUANTUM MECHANICS AND CONSCIOUSNESS

       Getting back to   established   scientific   theory,  normal  waking
       consciousness occurs when  the  nerve  cell  firing  rate  (synaptic
       switching rate) is high enough to spread out the waves associated
       with electrons to  fill  the  gaps  between  nerve  cells  (synaptic
       clefts) with waves of probability of similar amplitude.  This is
       described mathematically by  the  quantum  mechanical  mechanism  of
       tunneling.

       These waves are  interconnected  throughout  regions  of  the  brain
       through resonances, resulting in a large, complex,  unified, quantum
       mechanically defined resonance matrix filling a region in the brain.
       The waves are interconnected with each other and with information

                                      Page 3





       storage and sensory  input  mechanisms  within  these regions of the
       brain.

       The nerve cell  firing rate (v')  at  which  this  occurs  has  been
       modeled mathematically by  Evan  Harris  Walker (at  the  U.S.  Army
       Ballistics Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground) and corresponds to the
       threshold between waking  and  sleeping  consciousness in people and
       animals.  For normal  waking consciousness  to  exist,  the  synapse
       transmission frequency for the brain (v') must satisfy
       the condition:

                                               2/3
         v' must be greater than or equal to  N    /T


       where:

         N =  The total number of synapses in the brain (in humans,
              about 5E11)

         T =  Synaptic transmission delay time (the time interval
              required for the propagation of the excitation energy
              from one synapse to another)

       This theory ascribes consciousness to an association of the
       events occurring at any one synapse with events occurring at
       other synapses in the brain by means of a quantum mechanical
       propagation of information.  The sense of individual identity is
       an aspect of the continuity of the wave matrix residing in the
       brain [4].

       QUANTUM MECHANICS AND PSYCHOKINESIS

       By merely observing a phenomenon (resonating ones brain with it)
       one can affect the outcome, since the physical mechanisms in your
       brain are part of the wave matrix described by quantum mechanics.
       The information handling rate in resonance determines the amount
       of effect, along with the elapsed time of resonance and the
       probability distribution of the phenomenon you are observing
       [5].  According to Evan Harris Walker, quantum mechanical state
       selection can be biased by an observer if [5]:


         W te  is greater than or equal to  -Log  P(Qo-Qi)
          Q                                     2

       where:


            P(Qo-Qi) = Probability that state Qi will occur by chance
                       alone

                  W  = Information handling rate in process in brain
                  Q    associated with state vector selection (bits/sec)

                  te = Elapsed time

                   Q = Overall state vector


                                      Page 4





                  Qo = Initial physical state of system

                  Qi = State that manifests "paranormal" target event

       The effect of  consciousness  is  incredibly  small  on  macroscopic
       systems; but it  can  be  measurable   when  it  occurs  on  quantum
       mechanically defined and divergent systems, where  a  slight  change
       can amplify itself  as it propagates through the system.  The effect
       is about 1E-17 degrees on the angle  of  the  bounce  of cubes going
       down an inclined plane.  Changes in the angle of  bounce  result  in
       changes in displacement  of  the  cubes  that  increase about 50% on
       every bounce, and the effect is measurable  after  many bounces [6].
       The theory successfully  and  quantitatively modeled  the  differing
       amounts of displacement   observed   in   experiments  on  cubes  of
       different weights and weight distributions  [5].

       Walker also modeled  information   retrieval  in  "guess  the  card"
       experiments.  Simple, classical,  random  chance  would   predict  a
       smooth, binomial curve  for  the  probabilities of getting the right
       answer versus the number of subjects  making  successful predictions
       at these probabilities.   Walker's  model predicts  that  the  curve
       would have peaks  at  certain  levels  of probability of getting the
       right answer above those predicted by chance alone.

       Experimental data showed peaks at  the  locations modeled.  However,
       more people were  successful at the higher probability  levels  than
       Walker's model estimated.   This  is  considered  to  be evidence of
       learning enhancement  [5].

       SCIENTIFIC THEORY

       Mr. Walker's ideas and equations  would  only  be  hypotheses  if it
       weren't for the  fact that they have been tested experimentally  and
       found to predict the results of experiments with reasonable accuracy
       [4,5].  The evidence  meets  the usual rules of proof for scientific
       theory, and this  makes  Walker's  equations  legitimate  scientific
       theory.

       The non-local underlying  wave  patterns  beneath manifestations  of
       matter and energy that we hold in common with our surroundings allow
       us to influence reality and to obtain information about it using the
       power of the  mind.   This underlying interconnecting pattern is the
       very stuff of consciousness and  manifests,  not  only  as  matter &
       energy, but also as psychokinesis, precognition and other phenomenon
       that are only now beginning to be recognized and  embraced  by  some
       theories of modern physics.

       IMPLICATIONS OF QUANTUM CONSCIOUSNESS THEORY

       Deflections caused by  consciousness  are  not  caused  by  force or
       energy in the conventional sense;  but  by  something  more  subtle,
       namely effects within  the underlying wave structure  out  of  which
       matter and energy  are manifestations (collapse of the state vector)
       [5].

       To psychically obtain information  about  a target or to psychically
       influence events, one  has  to  have  one's  brain  resonating  with
       aspects of reality  interconnecting  the brain with the target.  The
       more one's brain resonates with non-local aspects of reality

                                      Page 5





       connecting with a   target,   the   more  communication  and  direct
       influence one can have on it.

       The more fundamentally diverse the  potential  outcomes of a process
       targeted are, the  more effect one gets from resonating  ones  brain
       with it  [5].   Also,  the  more small changes in the system tend to
       amplify as larger changes in the end result, the more effect one can
       get.  This provides an explanation  of  why  patterns  exist  within
       seemingly random events and why successful magic often  results in a
       chain of synchronicities.

       For a given  subject (performing under optimum conditions and having
       no difficulty visualizing the nature  of the experimental target nor
       psychological aversions to  the  target),  the  magnitudes   of  the
       results obtained in  tasks  to  affect  the  readings  on  measuring
       devices (such as  magnetometers,   radiation   detectors,  Josephson
       effect devices, balances,  etc.) can be related to  one  another  by
       calculating the probability  of  the  reading  based on the standard
       physical principles of quantum mechanics  [5].

       The sporadic nature of psi phenomena can be explained as a matter of
       outside observers randomizing the  process, causing dilution of will
       data channels and randomizing the results  [5].  Thus,  the need for
       secrecy in magical operations.

       One can no  longer  maintain  the  division between the observer and
       observed or between consciousness  and  the physical world.  Rather,
       both observer and  observed, along with both consciousness  and  the
       material world, are  merging  and  interpenetrating  aspects  of one
       whole indivisible reality  [1].

       Whatever the subtle level of reality  underlying  matter and energy,
       we are that  (including  our  consciousness).   If hidden  variables
       exist, we are  the  hidden  variables.   It  has been theorized that
       consciousness is an inseparable aspect  of  this underlying reality.
       When our awareness  connects  with  the  deepest  layer  of  reality
       interconnecting everything, we   may   experience   the   level   of
       consciousness beyond time and form  reported by many mystics.  It is
       this non local  structure that we share with nature  that  makes  it
       possible to "attune   to  nature,"  to  psychically  participate  in
       nature, and to live in accordance with it.

       What we are  usually aware of (normal  waking  consciousness)  is  a
       relatively superficial movement in the order of things.   Behind the
       things we are  aware  of in waking consciousness are a vast array of
       less strongly linked  phenomena.   This  latter  realm  is  commonly
       called the unconscious  (and  parts  of  it the subconscious).   The
       unconscious is not very accurate, since it forms a kind of ground of
       consciousness  [8].  Our  awareness  can  link  with  this ground of
       consciousness to gain information and to influence events.

       THE GODS, GODDESSES AND NATURE SPIRITS

       At this point, I diverge from theory  and  describe  some  plausible
       hypotheses.  Consciousness, at  a fundamental level,  is  associated
       with the continuity of the underlying structures out of which matter
       and energy manifest.   Everything  shares this continuous structure;
       therefore everything has consciousness  to  some  degree (though not
       necessarily normal waking consciousness).

                                      Page 6





       Quoting from Evan  Harris  Walker  (4):   "Consciousness  may  exist
       without being associated with either  a  living  system  or  a  data
       processing system.  Indeed,   since  everything   that   occurs   is
       ultimately the result  of one or more quantum mechanical events, the
       universe is 'inhabited'  by an almost  unlimited  number  of  rather
       discrete, conscious, usually   non-thinking   entities    that   are
       responsible for the   detailed   working  of  the  universe.   These
       conscious entities determine  (or   exist   concurrently   with  the
       determination) singly the outcome of each quantum mechanical  event,
       while the Schrodinger  equation  (to the extent that it is accurate)
       describes the physical constraint  placed on their freedom of action
       collectively."

       In shamanic and  in  religious  practice, one resonates  with  other
       intelligences to get  their assistance, inviting them to join in the
       work at hand.    These  intelligences   can   be   thought   of   as
       consciousness resonance matrices.  Some may be localized,  as we are
       (such as other  biological  intelligences,  plant  divas, power spot
       spirits, some deities, etc.); and  some may be non localized (spirit
       animals in the other world, some deities, etc.).

       The personalities of  the  Gods,  Goddesses  and spirits  that  many
       practitioners of religion  relate  to  can  also  be  thought  of as
       consciousness resonance matrices.  They can be very non-specific and
       disperse, or very specific (such  as  the  Orishas and other deities
       that can manifest in full possession of those who invoke them).

       QUANTUM MECHANICS AND MAGICAL RITUAL

       Consider a typical  structure  of  magical  ritual and  its  quantum
       mechanical explanation:

       o Purify one's   mind   and  one's  surroundings,  freeing  them  of
         interfering resonances, quieting  the static so that one can get a
         clear and strong resonance on the target desired.

       o Achieve a   non-localized   state  of  consciousness,   often   by
         resonating ones  mind  with  ones inner being, with the Earth, the
         sky, and ones surroundings.

       o Meditate on the elements (Earth,  Air,  Fire,  Water) representing
         non-local essences.   This helps your mind to resonate  powerfully
         non-locally.

       o After reaching  out  with  one's mind and connecting its resonance
         pattern intimately  with  the  non-local   web  of  wave  patterns
         connecting everything,  invoke deities whose natural  function  is
         related to  the  purpose  of  your  ritual.   If  successful, this
         connects your  mind  to  a powerful,  established,  non-localized,
         intelligent resonance matrix that (hopefully) joins in the magic.

       o Focus on the target of the work, connecting with the target.

       o While connected with the target, visualize the end result desired,
         thus creating a resonant template for the phenomenon  one wants to
         achieve.

       o Energize the  resonance  through  dance,  drumming,  chants,  pure
         channeling of will power, or other means.

       o Release the  energy into the target while strongly visualizing the
         target achieved (energizing the resonance in the target).

       o Ground,  removing ones mind from  the  direct,  resonant link with
         the target,  so that the patterns you have set in  motion  in  the
         target can  continue  with minimum interference  (to throw a ball,
         one has to let go).

       o Thank and say goodbye to the intelligences  one  works  with, thus
         disconnecting ones mind further from other resonance matrices.

       There are other forms of magic, and much more detail  to the forms I
       described.  There are   also  ethical  considerations.   This  paper
       provides a description of some aspects of the integration of quantum
       mechanics with magickal thinking, but it does not cover everything.

       SO WHAT?

       To read about theories of magic is  like  reading about sports.  You
       may pick up  a  few  ideas;  but  to  become  proficient,  you  must
       participate and play  the  game.   People  have  been  teaching  and
       performing magic for thousands of  years,  without  the  benefit  of
       quantum theory.  Many   magicians   have   had  to  separate   their
       scientific training from   their  magical  practice.   Now,  magical
       theory has been merged with scientific  theory, and more of the mind
       of those trained in science can resonate with magic.   Also, critics
       of magic can  be shown the scientific theory and data validating it,
       to show that there is more to magic than superstition.

       I have not  seen  any other quantitative  scientific  theories  that
       explain the results  of  experiments on psychokinesis,  extrasensory
       perception, and consciousness  as  accurately as Walker's theory, or
       that give as  satisfying of an explanation  of  the  synchronicities
       that I, as  a  worker of magic and a scientist, have  observed  from
       personal experience.  This  is not to say that these ideas represent
       ultimate truth, that alternative  theories  no  not  exist,  or that
       flaws will not  be  found  and  that alternative theories  will  not
       replace them.  I   would   welcome  hearing  from  others  who  have
       additional information and  insight   into   the  applicability  and
       limitations of the  theories  of modern Physics as  applied  to  the
       occult.

       MULTIPLE UNIVERSES?

       One interesting hypothesis  is  that  of  multiple  universes.  As I
       understand it, this hypothesis states  that  all  of the alternative
       possibilities allowed by quantum mechanics actually  occur,  but  in
       different universes.  Magicians  can interpret their magic as moving
       their awareness between these alternative  universes.   I have never
       seen the multiple  universe theory set up mathematically  in  a  way
       that would allow  it  to  be  quantitatively  tested, using physical
       measurements (like was done with Mr. Walker's theory),

       It  would be interesting to determine  if  and  to  what  extent the
       multiple universe hypothesis  can  be integrated with  Mr.  Walker's
       theory.  Consciousness, acting   at  a  gross  level,  seems  to  be
       relativistic - something experienced  by observers relative to their
       frames of reference.  Consciousness, at its ultimate level, seems to
       be subtler than time and location.

                                      Page 8





       When two observers  see  the  same thing, they both may have certain
       experiences in common, they both may  affect the thing observed, and
       they may report  some  of the events the same and some  differently.
       Experience may be  categorized in a multiple universe mode and/or in
       a single universe mode.  If would  be interesting to know which mode
       is most useful for various purposes.

       It is obvious  that  some  people  have  such  a different  personal
       perception of reality as to be seemingly out of touch with the world
       we experience around  them.   Their  self-world  image  becomes more
       important than anything,  and  they   adjust   their   memories  and
       perceptions to meet whatever emotional needs they have  at  the time
       [9].  Delusions of  personal  reality  and the high probability that
       such realities are real for the person experiencing that reality can
       result in interesting questions  about  what  is  real  and  what is
       unreal.

       Although the universe  may  be  a  seamless  whole, most  physicists
       describe it in  two different modes, depending on whether things are
       being observed or not  [7]:

       o A classical,  mechanistic mode  for  the  definite  attributes  of
         observation, and

       o A statistical, mathematical, quantum mechanical mode  for the wave
         patterns described by quantum mechanics.

       David Bohm has begun to develop new terminology that integrates both
       the process of observation and quantum theory  [1].
