          Since blood  sugar  measurements are widely used in the diagnosis
       of diabetes, it is important to understand  some  basic  concepts of
       hormone regulation to appreciate the mechanism of the  various types
       of diabetes.  The hormone in question is insulin, a complex chemical
       produced in small clusters of cells in the pancreas, which lies just
       behind the stomach.

          The insulin is absorbed into the blood stream where it is carried
       to the rest  of  the body.  The actions of insulin are several: most
       importantly, it causes the glucose  (blood sugar) to leave the blood
       and enter the cells of the various body organs.  It  is  as if there
       were a gate between the blood and the organs, and insulin is the key
       to the gate.

         In addition  to  facilitating  the  passage of sugar from blood to
       cells, insulin also allows many other  metabolic processes which all
       work toward the storage of energy into fat and other substances, and
       prevent the release  of such stores into the blood.   In  the  "fed"
       state, it is  obviously advantageous to pack away for future use any
       energy or body fuel not immediately  needed,  and insulin does this.
       Even in very small quantities, insulin can prevent  the breakdown of
       body stores into energy sources.

          It is  possible  to  thus  understand the effects of insufficient
       insulin.  For one thing, the level  of  glucose  in  the  blood will
       rise, especially after  a  meal  which  causes  the   digestion  and
       absorption through the intestines of large amounts of sugar.

          Nothing stops  the  glucose from getting into the blood, but once
       there, it has no place to go, and levels rise. The kidney is able to
       block the passage of sugar into the  urine  up  to a point, but once
       levels exceed around  180 milligrams per 10 cc of  blood,  there  is
       some overflow into the urine as well.

          Without insulin,  body  organs which depend on glucose for energy
       are unable to  extract  it from the  blood  and  begin  to  rely  on
       alternate sources of  energy.  Among these are some  forms  of  fat.
       The breakdown products  of these fatty substances are highly acid in
       nature, and begin to accumulate in the blood.  Called ketones, these
       byproducts are responsible  for the  condition  called  ketoacidosis
       which can occur in untreated diabetes.

          The disordered metabolism in diabetes can alter  the way in which
       the body handles  fats  including cholesterol.  Over the years, this
       leads to an accumulation of such fats  in  the small arteries of the
       body.  Characteristically, the arteries so affected tend to be those
       of the eyes, the kidney, the heart, and the brain.

          In addition,  diabetes can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart
       attack, and stroke. Of course, the better the degree of control, the
       less likely the complications, according to most authorities.

            Types and Causes

          The causes of diabetes are not  known,  although  some  clues are
       available.  Most cases  fall  into one of two types,  which  may  be
       quite distinct in their causes.

          The first  type,  or  Type I, is generally acquired in childhood,
       and usually is found to be a near  total  lack  of  internal insulin
       production.  If untreated,   patients   often   will   develop   the
       potentially urgent complication     of    ketoacidosis    (discussed
       elsewhere).  Such patients  are usually  thin,  and  always  require
       insulin administration to sustain life.

          The other type, Type II, is generally acquired in  adulthood,  is
       most common in  obese  patients,  and  may  be  treated with dietary
       measures or occasionally oral medication, with only a small minority
       requiring insulin. Although severe short and long-term complications
       and symptoms may  occur  in  the  untreated  case,  ketoacidosis  in
       unlikely.

          Type I  diabetes  is  of unknown cause; it may  be  caused  by  a
       preceding virus which affects the pancreas, or an autoimmune process
       within the body.   Although a genetic factor may play a role in some
       way the relationship is not clear  or  overwhelming.  In genetically
       equivalent identical twins, only a third to a half  of siblings with
       type I diabetes   will   also   develop   the   disease.  Perhaps  a
       vulnerability is inherited, and only those exposed to some offending
       agent go on to develop the disease.

         Type II diabetes is highly genetic,  with a nearly 100% occurrence
       in identical twins  of  affected  patients.   The  actual  cause  is
       unknown, and it  often  occurs in patients with no family history of
       the disorder.  Clearly obesity plays a critical role in bringing out
       the disease in  susceptible patients.   In  general  these  patients
       retain the ability  to produce some insulin, but in  response  to  a
       meal, the response   is  long  delayed,  and  often  inadequate.  In
       addition, many patients are resistant  to the action of insulin even
       when it is  present,  especially  if  obesity is present;  in  these
       cases, the insulin  level  may  actually  be higher than normal, yet
       diabetes occurs due to insulin resistance.  The incidence of Type II
       diabetes increases with age.

            Symptoms

          Symptoms of  increased  blood sugar  include  fatigue,  increased
       appetite if enough  blood  sugar  is  wasted  into  the  urine,  and
       increased urination as the sugar causes the kidney to produce higher
       volumes to dissolve the excess load.  When the latter occurs, thirst
       is increased as well to make up for the lost body fluid.

          As levels of blood sugar rise and ketosis occurs (see above), the
       body fluids become  excessively  acid.   One of the defenses against
       acidity is to decrease the carbon  dioxide  in  the  blood, which is
       accomplished by increasing the rate and depth of respiration.

          The full  blown picture of ketoacidosis is a dehydrated, obtunded
       or even comatose  patient,  who   is   breathing   heavily   with  a
       characteristic odor to  the breath from the ketones  in  the  blood.
       The lesser symptoms are as above.

          Diabetics are  prone  to  symptoms  from the complications due to
       arterial blockage discussed above.  Vision loss, heart problems, and
       loss of kidney can occur. Nerves  in  the  legs,  arms, and face can
       become painful or  numb for weeks, months, or permanently.  Many  of
       these complications require  the presence of the disease for decades
       or more.

             Diagnosis

          Once the diagnosis is suspected, or an elevated sugar is detected
       on screening lab work, certain criteria  have  been  established for
       doctors to follow.   Typical numbers for adequate  diagnosis  in  an
       appropriate setting might  include a fasting sugar over 150 mg.%, or
       repeated after-meal levels over 200 mg%.

          The normals vary with age, and certain factors can interfere with
       the test.  A  controlled  glucose   "tolerance"  test  involves  the
       administration of a  measured  amount of oral glucose,  followed  by
       checks of the  blood  every  30  to  60 minutes for 2 or more hours.
       Newer normal references consider  many  factors,  and  the  ultimate
       diagnosis often requires repeated checks and judgment on the part of
       the treating physician.

            Treatment

          General measures  common  to all diabetics include  reduction  to
       normal body weight  if obesity is present, moderate or even vigorous
       activity if this is considered safe from a general health standpoint
       (exercise has an insulin-like effect), and dietary discretion.

          Years ago, diabetic diets were  strictly  controlled  formulae of
       rigid proportions of fat, carbohydrates, and protein  organized into
       "exchanges" which made  the diabetic's life highly structured around
       the diet.  Today, diet remains crucial in a comprehensive management
       program, but it is recognized that much more flexibility is possible
       without harm.  Total calories are  determined,  ranging usually from
       1500 to 3000 per day.

          Sweets are   largely   avoided,   but   not  entirely   so,   and
       carbohydrates are allowed liberally, as is dietary fiber.  Vegetable
       fats are encouraged  instead  of animal or dairy fats, and should be
       moderate.

          Generally, one fifth of the days calories are taken at breakfast,
       with two fifths each at lunch and supper, or adjusted to allow for a
       small snack in between.

          This oversimplification  is  largely   adjusted   for  individual
       variations, and a  comprehensive dietary educational  program  of  a
       personal nature is  vital.  Dietary professionals often provide such
       training as part of a larger diabetes program.

          When diet and exercise alone are  inadequate  to  normalize blood
       sugars, one alternative for type II diabetics is the use of pills

                                      Page 3





       which lower blood  sugar  either by acting like insulin, stimulating
       the pancreas to produce more insulin,  or  making  body  cells  more
       sensitive to insulin.

          A long-running  controversy  exists  over the report  that  these
       drugs can increase the risk of sudden death (presumably due to heart
       attacks), but the  data is not clear at this time.  Most authorities
       agree that the drugs have a genuine  place  in the management of the
       disease, especially in symptomatic elderly patients  who  can not or
       will not follow  a  dietary program, or who do not respond to such a
       program. Excellent control is rarely  achieved,  but the ease of use
       and lesser concern about overall life expectancy  may  outweigh  the
       theoretical risks.  This   issue  is  always  best  decided  by  the
       physician and patient  considering   all   the   individual  factors
       involved.  Chlorpropamide, tolazimide,  tolbutamide,  and  gliburide
       are examples of  such  drugs.   Some  physicians  avoid  these drugs
       altogether.

          Insulin is the main means of controlling  diabetes  which  is not
       responding to diet,  and  is  the  necessary treatment  for  type  I
       disease.  Various types  are  available, varying in their peak onset
       of action, duration, etc. Often, two types are given in combination.
       Insulin is given by the patient as an injection under the skin using
       disposable very small  needles  and   syringes,   after  appropriate
       training.

          Although the  prospect seems drastic at first, diabetics  quickly
       accept this as  a  routine  part  of  their regimen.  In the initial
       phase, many adjustments are necessary,  sometimes  in  the hospital,
       until the right doses are determined.  Side effects include allergic
       reactions and hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) episodes.

          Modern medicine  stresses  the  importance  of near-normal  blood
       sugars in the  prevention of complications of diabetes.  The optimal
       patient checks her own blood tests  through  a  finger  stick one or
       more times daily, checks occasional urine samples for sugar, follows
       a consistent diet and activity program, and adjusts the insulin dose
       as needed within guidelines established by the physician.

          When problems arise, the physician is consulted  as  a  resource,
       and regular medical  follow-up  is scheduled routinely.  The effects
       of various stresses, both physical  and  emotional,  are anticipated
       and allowed for.  Occasional low sugar episodes are  accepted  as  a
       price of good  control,  but  are  usually  easily reversible with a
       light snack.

          Some diabetics use a portable insulin  pump which injects insulin
       through an intravenous tube around the clock.  It is  felt that this
       is comparable to,  but  not  necessarily  superior  to,  a carefully
       applied program of standard injections  of long- acting insulin with
       frequent blood sugar monitoring and appropriate adjustment.

          The pregnant woman with diabetes requires special  control, since
       even modest blood  sugar  elevations  are potentially harmful to the
       fetus.  Stricter criteria apply, and  closer management is in order.
       In some women,  diabetes appears under the physiologic  "stress"  of
       pregnancy, only to  improve after childbirth.  Some such patients go
       on to develop long-standing diabetes in later years.

         Only rarely  are  things  as  smooth as the above description, but
       most diabetics will do very well under  the  guidance of a concerned
       team of a  physician,  dietician,  nurses, and other  professionals.
       Many become highly  sophisticated  about  their  disease, and groups
       such as the American Diabetes Association  and local resources offer
       invaluable support.

          Preventive measures  such as immunizations, foot  care  (diabetes
       predisposes to infections  of  the feet), and travel precautions are
       also important.

            Prognosis

          It is  very  difficult  to  generalize  about  the  prognosis  of
       diabetes since it is such a variable disease.  It seems  fair to say
       that the disease  decreases  life expectancy, and diminishes quality
       of life through its complications and treatment requirements.

          Only recently has the concept of very rigid control been feasible
       through home blood glucose monitoring,  and  there  is much evidence
       and great hope that tomorrow's diabetic can look forward  to a near-
       normal life if such control is maintained.

            Horizons

          Research is  proceeding  in  several directions which may provide
       breakthroughs in diabetes, though  none  is  currently available for
       general application.

          One is an artificial pancreasœwhich takes regular readings of the
       blood sugar, and  automatically injects through an intravenous  tube
       the appropriate amount  of insulin needed on almost an instantaneous
       basis.

          Another is  the possibility of  transplanting  pancreatic  tissue
       from a donor  into  the diabetic patient, although  the  troublesome
       rejection problems are  seen  here as in most transplant procedures.
       HealthNet will keep you alert to  any  meaningful  advances  in this
       area.
