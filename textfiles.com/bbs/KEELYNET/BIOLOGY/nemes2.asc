         (Editor's Note:  This  is  the  kind  of story that thrills even a
                         crusty old  journalist  who  has  spent  nearly
                         30 years scrounging  around "unorthodoxy"  in   an
                         effort  to    dredge   up   facts     that   cause
                         consternation;  in   an   effort  to  provoke  the
                         "I'll be damned!"  response  from  readers. In the
                         mid-70's  I wrote about the Royal  Rife microscope
                         -- a  microscope  that  is   still weaving its way
                         around the pages   of  underground   and  off-the-
                         beaten-path  journals.    The     "tuned    light"
                         microscope of   Royal  Rife,  who was  financed by
                         the Timken steel dollars,  was a beauty, no  doubt
                         -- but when  compared  to  the Nemescope, the Rife
                         device is a mere pretender. This is one of those
                         stories  that this  editor rates   among  the  top
                         10 all-time yarns.

                         MAGNETS magazine  is  the  perfect forum  for this
                         story.  We are  on  the  cutting  edge of the most
                         exciting technology  of  all -- the  phenomena  of
                         permanent magnetism   --  and we have an  audience
                         that has already indicated and ability  to be open
                         and critical at   the  same time; to be scientific
                         and awed as well.)

                                 By Tom Valentine

       The  inventor of   the  Nemescope  was a  brilliant  brain  surgeon.
       His name was   Elmer  P.  Nemes  and   he  ran  the  Nemes  Research
       Laboratories, 4207 West Third Street,  Los   Angeles  5,  California
       during the middle 1950's. Unfortunately, he was also an  alcoholic.

                                      Page 1





       He was killed  in a drunken brawl  in San Diego  in the  early  60's
       -- he  had hit rock bottom, and stayed there.

       His invention, the Nemescope, which  we are detailing on these pages
       in  an effort  to entice  others to  recreate this vitally important
       work, was stolen from a store called the Bryn Camera Shop on Melrose
       Avenue  in  1957,  ending  a  remarkable  series  of experiments and
       demonstrations. The device was in the shop to have an electric field
       finder installed.

       The person responsible  for revealing this story to  me is the grand
       lady of  health and nutrition,  Betty Lee Morales,  80, a long time
       resident of  Topanga and an individual  with unbridled curiosity who
       has  been  involved  in  thousands  of  research projects during her
       lifetime.  She and  her husband  were directly  responsible for the
       remarkable photographs  from the Nemescope  screen, that you see on
       these  pages, and  her incessant  curiosity spurred  the inventor to
       extra efforts.

       "We  lost  track  of  the  stolen  machine  in  New York," Betty Lee
       explained, "and the technology has lain dormant all this time."

       Who stole the  machine? What role did the  secretive segments of the
       United States  government play? Betty Lee  herself was involved with
       the Central  Intelligence Agency in  its earliest years after WWII,
       and while representing  Dr. Nemes she worked directly  with the late
       Congressman  Craig Sheperd  of San  Bernardino, who  had arranged a
       major  appropriation for  in-depth and  clandestine research on the
       Nemescope just prior to its theft and subsequent disappearance.

       The photographs in  this issue were taken directly  off a 12-foot by
       12-foot screen where the images  danced energetically in full color.
       The Nemescope projected motion pictures  of the micro-world onto the
       screen. Every  object, in a  medium of distilled  water on a quartz
       slide, projected it's own natural  colors  --  no  dyes were needed.
       The photo on  the   opposite  page, for example, is   a  picture  of
       molecules of iron   nucleate  from  the  juice   of  a  Jade  plant,
       squeezed for the filming experiment  on  the  spur of  the moment by
       Betty Lee.  The   iron  nucleates  were  linked  together   with   a
       sparkling, vibrant energy that formed patterns on  the screen as the
       living  juice was photographed and projected.

       "The  flowing lines   of   force   were  clearly  visible  and  very
       symmetrical," Betty Lee explained, "but  later, when the life forces
       in the juice  evidently died, there was no  energy. The emissions of
       energy were silver and gold  luminescent and traveled, apparently at
       the speed of light."

       The  Nemescope  photos  and  explanations  on  these pages speak for
       themselves. Now, how did these pictures come about?

       Nuclear magnetic  resonance had been firmly  established a few years
       before Dr.  Nemes began his experiments  with "radiation potentials,
       wave lengths of emitted quanta and color spectra."

       Here is Dr. Nemes' summary of the invention:

         "The specimen which  is to be examined by  the multiple source
          microscope,  is bombarded,  for example,  with two sources of

                                      Page 2





          energy. One  of these sources  is energy at  a frequency which
          approximates the frequency of  one of the radiation potentials
          of the material  forming the  specimen, and  the other source
          produces  energy at  a frequency  which is  slightly different
          from the first frequency.

          "The energy from the first  source impinging upon the specimen
          causes the atoms to be excited and to emit quanta of energy of
          a frequency  which  is  dependent  upon  the  frequency of the
          energy of the first source.  The energy from the second source
          serves to spread out the  frequency of the emitted energy over
          a range  of  frequencies  so  that  a  colored light effect is
          produced.  The  colored  light   effect,  which  is  a highly
          magnified image  of the specimen  being examined, may then be
          photographed.

          "If desired, for photographic  purposes, the spectrum which is
          emitted by  the specimen being examined  may be intensified by
          ultra-violet  or   visible  light,  comparatively   long wave
          radiation. This  combined light pattern is  then enlarged by a
          conventional  optical system  and projected  on the screen or
          some other  suitable device and the  composite is photographed
          by a camera."

       Betty Lee's description may add  to our perspective. "The device was
       an  emission-type microscope  --  it  depended upon resolution, not
       magnification.  An  electron  microscope  might  get  to 16,000X in
       magnification,  but not  have much  resolution. You  can compare the
       images of a gold grid taken with an electron microscope and with the
       Nemescope.  (Photos on  page 28).  We projected  images that were 5
       million X."

       Betty  Lee's recollection  of the  key feature  of the device is as
       follows:

          "Dr. Nemes designed a radiation  gun, which was the essence of
          the machine. I recall that it  was a steel pipe about 2 inches
          in diameter and  about 10 inches long. Holes  were bored in it
          and  semiprecious stones,  or jewels  representing a different
          wave band were set in the pipe. The jewels had to be imperfect
          (see item  6 of the inventor's  own summary coming up), so we
          heated them  in an autoclave  up to 5,500  degrees F to cause
          imperfections."

          According  to  the  Nemes papers,  U.S. Patent  #2,850,661 covers
          the first unit  of the "short and   long  wave radiation system,"
          that he  had devised. The inventor summarized the  principles  of
          his Nemescope in  August  of  1956,  and  submitted  an
          amendment  to   his  patent  application, which had been filed in
          July 1955.

       The  summary  will  be  first  printed  verbatim, then his comments,
       unfortunately without accompanying drawings, will also be verbatim.

           1. The first  unit is a cold cathode  tube (lamp) (U.S.  Patent
              2850661)  with  multiple  filaments  directly  but separately
              charged. The   filaments   preheat   the    platinum,   gold,
              germanium and   tungsten  targets.  The  function   of   this
              invention is explained in  "Additional Claims on Lamps,  Cold

                                      Page 3





              Cathode Tube,  Reissued  to   United States Patent  Office to
              Patent 2850661."

              The cathode gun acts as the  primary  source  of illumination
              and bombarder of the specimen.

           2. The second part of the instrument, which is called the long
              and  short  wave  high   frequency  condenser,  contains high
              frequency  coils,   quartz   window,   filters   and   radio-
              active emitters,   electrostatic  or  electro-magnetic coils,
              and also quartz  prisms or   lenses to  focus the  relatively
              long wave rays.

           3. When  the specimen is  bombarded with a  multiple source of
              radiation  and  the   proper excitation  potential  arranged,
              the organic  or   inorganic  matter  emit   an ultra-spectral
              image in true  colors. Concerning   the molecular  structure,
              diffusion, cohesion and wave length of the examining  matter,
              the rays can be  arranged  so  that  the  primary  source  of
              radiation, by  adjusting   the condenser  by  wave  length or
              potential, will induce the appearance of the true image.

           4. The radio-active emitter or gun maintains a radium filament
              with individual  filters for  Alpha,  Beta   and  Gamma rays.
              Also we   could  use,   if  so   desired, isotopes   such  as
              carbon 14,  cesium   and  cobalt.   The  Gamma  ray could  be
              emitted also by interchangeable   extra  tubes.   The  radium
              crystals and  other  isotopes also  can be melted   into  the
              quartz  condenser lens.

              Furthermore, shields  of  very thin  plates of gold, aluminum
              or platinum can be used to control the radiation.

           5. The specimen is under a quartz cover slide, or in the cases
              of  gases  or   liquids,    is    in  capillary   attachment,
              emission attachment   or   between  mica  plates   or   other
              transparent useable  material.  The  specimen  also  could be
              examined by the capillary  system  across   high  voltage and
              temperature changes  could be measured indirectly  concerning
              the examined specimen.

           6. Pick-up unit. Fine grain fluorescent screen is incorporated
              to a  system  of  optically  corrected quartz lenses, thereby
              the invisible radiation can  be  picked up and transferred to
              longer rays.  The  lens  could  be  coated   with  evaporated
              metallic silicate,  aluminum,   magnesium, boron, etc.,  with
              the mixture  of  the  impure   sphalerite   single  crystals,
              activated phosphides   of   zinc   sulphide,   zinc   cadmium
              sulphide,  etc.  If the pick-up quartz   or   diamonds   have
              impurities   such   as single  micro-crystals   of   metallic
              silicate,  phosphides   of  zinc sulphate  or  zinc   cadmium
              sulphate,  these  impurities  act  as fine grain  fluorescent
              material. In   that  case   the  resolving  power  could   be
              increased by  such  fluorescent impurities  that  the  single
              crystals or  particles  act   not only as a fine grain screen
              but as  individual  360 degree  emitters  and  resolution  is
              theoretically  unlimited   and  the  magnification  increases
              in proportion.   Therefore   a   single   molecule   can   be
              picked up individually  and   reproduced  by  spectrum   and

                                      Page 4





              lines and   structure.  The  single  image  is   directed  by
              focusing plates or prisms  to   the  reflectors,  mirrors, or
              single or double prism system and  through this  set-up  only
              the preferred image will be picked up by the image amplifying
              tube.

           7. The amplification system  contains: (A) deflecting cathode,
              (B) deflecting    prism,   adjustable   by   axis.   In   the
              amplification system  the amplifying   units contain  concave
              shaped cathodes  and  plates,   silver  or  rhodium   coated,
              where  not  only amplification but  further magnification can
              be obtained.  The plates relative   to  the cathode  are more
              positively charged.

              The  amplification  units  can  be  individually separated by
              perforated mica    sheets   (See   drawings)    and   further
              correction of   the image  can be  maintained with  secondary
              and tertiary correcting screens.  The final image is
              directed to the prism and reflecting system.

           8. Additional interchangeable filters can  be incorporated to
              filter  out   undesirable   rays.   Skiatron   or  equivalent
              color sensitive  projecting  tube   is indirectly  energized.
              Additional lenses   can  be   added  for  different types  of
              projection.  The previously   mentioned   amplification
              unit,   if  further  magnification    or   amplification   is
              desired,  can be repeated.

              Technically  and    theoretically,    by     this     system,
              resolution depends   on  the  wave  length  of  the  selected
              short wave radiation  sources   and    the  ultra-microscopic
              size single  crystal-screen.   Magnification   of    such  is
              unlimited and  the instrument  is  able  to  maintain  images
              in  full color and spectrum.

              Following that summary, Dr.  Nemes  wrote  of his "additional
              claims on lamps and the cold cathode tube."  His comments may
              serve to further our understanding of the technology.

              (A) Multiple illuminator filed with  the U.S.  Patent  Office
                  in 1955.  (Docket  No.  2470  in  1955  by Harris, Kiech,
                  Foster, Etc., Patent Attorneys   Ser.  No. 540, 740  Oct.
                  17, 1955  Illuminator  Mailed  Aug. 9,   1956.)  Claiming
                  that the   continuous flow of energy  can  be  maintained
                  by  creating  an ion differential  between  two  poles of
                  different  materials  (metals,  gases  and   some   other
                  elements)  which   exhibit   the  K   factor,  as  Boron,
                  Magnesium,  Tungsten,   Titanium,    Wolfram,  Beryllium,
                  Krypton, Hard    Carbon,    Zirconium,    Gold,
                  Platinum, Nickel, Aluminum-Sulphate, etc.

       As  stated in   the  Work   Book, page  47, (between   July  11  and
       October 10, 1955)  a  chain  reaction  takes  place  and maintains a
       continuous electron flow or  shorter  ray  flow after preheating the
       cathode  with  an   electric   current.  The  two elements  involved
       have  different behavior  and   charge.  (Ref. page 42; Merk  index:
       listed  55 different   elements,   possessing   the  K  factor,   as
       possible  sources of   continuous energy production  plus  a  second
       element, Magnesium, Aluminum  Sulphate,  etc., and maintain the flow
       without any further charge.)
                                      Page 5





       On page 50 of the same Work Book, the inventor shows a drawing of  a
       Magnesium  coated  Platinum  cathode,  energized by a Zirconium arc.
       A continuous flow  of   energy  was produced even after the electric
       current was  cut off. This setup  was  tested  in October 26,  1955.
       The enclosed picture  from   the  next page shows schematically  the
       principle of the cold cathode tube.

       The  drawing  under   M   2599,   October   26,   1955  explains the
       working of the  principle by using  a  set  of multiple cathodes and
       anodes that can be  adjusted to different distances of the emitters.
       Therefore,  a chain  reaction,  which  can be adjusted  to   various
       frequencies,  takes place   without further use of external  energy.
       Drawing  No. 13351,  Fig. 1  and  2   show  the  construction of the
       instrument.

       Said  patent  application   mentions   also   a  gas  inlet  to  the
       chamber  through  which   various   gases   could   be  injected  as
       Argon,  Helium, Nitrogen,  Xenon, Hydrogen  or combinations of such.
       These  could  create  the  same  effect   as the various coatings of
       Magnesium, Boron, Aluminum, Sulphate, etc.

              (B)  In the construction of the Nemescope the incandescent
                   energy  source  was  used  further  only   to   create a
                   broader spectrum  since  the  cold cathode radiation was
                   tested as to its efficiency  without the combination  of
                   the primary  charge.  The presence and   maintenance  of
                   the chain   reaction  was  proven  as  existing  between
                   cathode, anode,  and  grid  without  the  primary energy
                   source.

                   The cooling coil  as reported in the cold   cathode tube
                   served the   purpose  of   prolonging  the  life of  the
                   filaments in the tube.  Our   setup  with  the   special
                   arrangement of   the  targets proved to  be  capable  of
                   keeping the temperature slightly above room temperature,
                   whereas,  otherwise  the temperature would rise to 100øC
                   or higher.

       NEMESCOPE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

       In  Patent 2850661,   Paragraph  39:   "It  is   preferred  that the
       target  be  made   of  platinum   or   other   material  having  the
       property of absorbing  oxygen   as  its  temperature  increases  and
       giving off oxygen  as  its  temperature decreases. The absorption of
       oxygen by  the platinum  when the  platinum is heating up produces a
       cooling action in  the surrounding atmosphere and materially reduces
       the operating  temperature  of  the  filaments  of  the  lamp."   An
       essential factor in  the   cooling  process  was therefore  achieved
       through the basic nature of the targets and their arrangement.

       In the  Nemescope  the  principle   of  the  cold   cathode tube has
       existed  for several   years  and   has  been   called  "black  body
       energy."  The  targets  (cathode)  energized  through indirect
       heating by the Zirconium arc,  consisted of gold and platinum,
       tungsten, germanium, etc., and were different in weight (ratio
       1.5; 1.01). The  Grid consisted of 2 antennae  and one rhodium
       coated  concave mirror  in an  electromagnetic field, directed
       the cathode rays  to the center of the  beam going through the
       axis of the specimen.

                                      Page 6





       In the  patent of the  cold cathode tube  No. 2850661 is also
       demonstrated a rhodium coated concave mirror behind the target
       and the  filaments arrangement which  serve a double purpose:

         (1) to focus the visible ultraviolet rays, etc., to the center
             of the spectrum and (2) act as a focusing grid for the cathode
             rays.

       Finally,  in  1959,  two  years  after  the  prototype unit had been
       stolen, Dr. Nemes was encouraged by Betty Lee and his other partners
       to write  a "construction guide"  for his Nemescope.  We now reprint
       the complete documentation for the first time:

           The multiple  frequency source called,  "Cold Cathode Tube or
           Lamp," (A) contains a radium SH  and platinum plates S'L & SL.
           The  wave lengths  of the  gun become  ineffective long before
           they  reach the  specimen, but  they do  modulate the carrier
           frequencies  composed   of  shorter  wave   lengths  of light
           radiations. The low frequency light is obtained from filaments
           H1 H2 H3 heated to  incandescence by 110VAC. The heat produced
           by this incandescence is used  to indirectly heat the gold and
           platinum which  starts a reaction between  each other.  This is
           self-sustaining, once started.

           These  gold and  platinum sources  must be  adjustable. It is
           suggested, that they be mounted  on screw-mounts, the heads of
           which  have  a  90ø  arm  with  magnetic  tips,  to  be turned
           magnetically through  the glass envelope  of the cold cathode
           tube. To reflect  most of the radiation of  the chain reaction
           between the gold and platinum  plates, a coated concave mirror
           Mfoc is placed behind the  filaments. The focal length of this
           mirror is  to be such as  to focus correctly to  the suspended
           quartz  lenses  FL1  in  the  condenser.  This  mirror may be
           compared to  the cathode in  the somewhat similar  cathode ray
           tube, hereinafter  referred to as  CRT. Therefore it  is to be
           negatively charged or at 0 reference potential. The subsequent
           elements are  the intensity control G1  and the focusing grids
           or anodes.

           At  the radiating  end of  the cold  cathode tube  a window of
           quartz maintains the low vacuum  within the cold cathode tube.
           The function of subsequent quartz windows QzW1 through QzW5 is
           similar.  The presence  of the  following gases  is suggested:
           helium,  Argon,  nitrogen,  Xenon  or  a  mixture thereof.  The
           radium  gun,  opposite  the  cathode  reflector  CREF emanates
           Alpha,  Beta  and  Gamma  radiations,  comprising  the higher
           frequencies.

           The structure of the cathode  is as follows: if the structural
           metal of the cathode  is tungsten, molybdenum, platinum, gold,
           a plating  of  rhodium,  magnesium,  aluminum  or beryllium is
           suggested; the  object being to  make the sum  total molecular
           weight of the structural and coated metal as high as possible,
           keeping the ratio of molecular  weight as low as possible with
           the coating having the lower molecular weight.

           The focusing coil  Lfoc and the deflecting plates  of gold and
           platinum Adef1  and Adef2 help  insure focus. The  mass of the
           deflecting plates is not altogether critical, but the ratio of

                                      Page 7





           masses is critical in that it must  be a ratio of 1.01 of gold
           to 1.5 of platinum.

           Between the cold cathode and the next component, the condenser
           "B",  a slot  must be  left  open  to allow  the insertion of
           interchangeable  filters.  These  consist  of  four different
           types.  First,  a  gold  and   silver  leaf  (a  thickness of
           1/10,000th  of  an  inch),   transparent  filters;  third, an
           infra-red filter  which can be constructed  of carborundum, or
           any  other suitable  material; fourth,  a blue  filter. It is
           advised that these be structurally supported by quartz on both
           sides,  and that  these be  mounted on  a motor-driven circle
           which  has  one  position  for  a  neutral filter, composed of
           either nothing or black carbon.

           Since it is desirable to obtain variable resolutions and since
           resolution  is directly  governed by  the wave  length of the
           radiation  passing through  the specimen,  it is necessary to
           vary  the  wave  length.  This  can  be  most  easily done by
           modulating  the constant  wave length  radiations of  the cold
           cathode tube with a wave length from an electronic oscillator.

           For this purpose  a coil Mmod has been  constructed 90ø to the
           radiation  beam. There  are plates  appropriately connected to
           this  coil which  seem to   act as  deflecting plates  for the
           shorter wave length radiations.

           There are also focusing lenses mounted adjustably to focus the
           radiations.   All   optical   components   must  be optically
           corrected. If these lenses  are radium impregnated, the radium
           guns would no longer be necessary.

           The  coating of  the lens  of the  gun can  be of any suitable
           radio-active material  or isotope which emits  Alpha, Beta and
           Gamma  radiations. These  are otherwise  necessary because the
           effective range of Alpha, Beta and Gamma rays is only 3.9c.  if
           unaccelerated  artificially. Around  the assembly  of the cold
           cathode tube  and condensers must  be constructed a radiation
           shield of lead approximately 1/8" in thickness.

           After the shield, the sample slide can be inserted. This slide
           must be of quartz glass,  or some other material more pervious
           to short wave length. Here are also mounted two high frequency
           parabolic antennae to  radiate the electromagnetic frequencies
           from the  oscillator. These antennae  are encompassed radially
           (only) by focusing coils.

           Close to the  axial center of the radiation  beam, yet outside
           the beam itself, should be mounted one or two small (1/4 watt)
           fluorescent bulbs  If1. The output  of these is  not critical,
           for through the amplification of  three x 1,000,000 their wave
           lengths become  strong enough to  project the image  to almost
           any distance.

           The next unit called image amplifier, "C", contains first some
           gold and platinum deflection plates Adef3 and Adef4 and then a
           quartz prism P1 unto which the beam is focused by the focusing
           lenses FL2.

           The optical system components can  be made of either quartz or
           commercial diamond.  The quartz must  be coated with metallic
           silicates,  phosphides, etc.  The commercial  diamond must be
           electrostatically   charged   so   as   to   procure current
           amplification  due to  the inherent  impurities in commercial
           diamonds. This  electrostatic charge has  to be in sequential
           order of positive-going electrodes  in reference to ground; to
           avoid repelling the radiation beam. The reverse side of prisms
           P1 and P2 are to be mirror coated with conventional materials.
           The focusing coil  Lfoc in the vicinity of  prism P1 should be
           adjustable as well  as all other focusing coils;  that is they
           are to be constructed so as to permit axial movement.

           The dynodes D1 to D9, inclusive, are the amplifying electrodes
           between  which a  voltage of  not less  than 18  VDC is to be
           maintained.  The  curvature  of  the  dynodes  is  to decrease
           successively from Dynode 1 to 9.

           The correcting  screens Rs1 and  Rs2 are to  be constructed of
           mica  or quartz  which is  to be  perforated by electro-static
           breakdown of  the mica, across a  spark gap. The holes  on the
           two screens  are to be located  so that the beam  which passes
           through a hole  on screen Rs1 does not pass  through a hole of
           Rs2. The screens are to be coated with suitable phosphorescent
           material,  then activated  by a  radio-active source prior to
           installation.

           The screen Rs1 is to be positioned so that the beam will first
           strike the mica  and then the coating. This  screen is also to
           be located at a 90ø angle to the beam, half way between dynode
           D2 and D3.  This screen is also to be  located in the magnetic
           field of  the second focusing  coil in the  vicinity of dynode
           D3.

           The screen Rs2  is to be so located as  to present the coating
           first. Prism P2  is to refract the beam  from Dynode 9 through
           quartz  window   QzW5  and  quartz   filter  QzFIL  which is
           interchangeable much like the  before mentioned quartz filter.
           The  lens projecting  system FL3  is to  project the amplified
           image onto the screen.

           For further amplification, repeated stages of amplifying tubes
           can be used, the only  limitation being the supply of voltage.
           After sufficient amplification, the  image can be photographed
           from  the  screen,  or   directly  from  the  instrument.  For
           television closed  circuitry, a camera  need only be directed
           towards the image end of  the image amplifying tube and either
           color or monochromatic television can be projected.

           It  is  suggested  that  no  orthodox  color  tube be used for
           projection, but that one be  used which has been modified with
           a radium gun directed toward the  cathode of said tube, thusly
           the heater of said tube  can be eliminated after having heated
           the cathode sufficiently. This  is to achieve scale resolution
           finer than that perceptible by the naked eye.

           It is   in the interest  of science and  technology that MAGNETS
           has resented this feature. Should the Nemescope, or a comparable
           device be  forthcoming   because  of  this  information,   our

           ability  to   understand   the   universe  around  us   will  be
           considerably enhanced.

           Perhaps  we might  even learn   to focus  and analyze variations
           in magnetic   fields,   thereby    expanding    our    knowledge
           considerably.
