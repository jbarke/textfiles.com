                         DOCTORS, DOLLARS & DRUGS

     Is your physician helping the medical industry `push' pills?

         For most  people,  the idea of pushing drugs conjures visions
    of criminals hunkering  over piles  of  cash  and  illegal  white,
    powdery substances.

         But drug pushing - the legal kind - happens  every  day  in a
    medical world that's invisible to patients.

         It happens  in  virtually every doctors' office through face-
    to-face meetings with  gift-bearing   drug   salespeople,   during
    company-sponsored seminars held  in  vacation  resorts  and  hotel
    conference centers, and  whenever  a  physician  opens  a  medical
    journal to page after page of colorful  ads  espousing the virtues
    of prescription medication.

         "It's third-party marketing" to a middleman  -  the  doctor -
    whose prescribing behavior   helps   determine   company  profits,
    according to a drug company salesman who requested anonymity.
    "It's not like getting [a consumer] to sign on the dotted line."

         Industry spokespeople and some  doctors  say  that  marketing
    efforts generally result  in  a better-informed physician  who  is
    better able to care for his or her patients.

         Other doctors  call  third-party,  or  indirect,  marketing a
    waste of time and money.

         Drug industry critics have produced  some evidence suggesting
    that drug marketing  has  combined  with other factors  to  prompt
    doctors into sometimes   prescribing  useless  or  harmful  drugs.
    Doctors also can be influenced by  patient  requests  for  certain
    drugs, research suggests.

         Ideally, a  doctor prescribes a drug because  the  scientific
    evidence shows it   will   help  the  patient.    To  what  extent
    prescribing decisions are based on  science  and to what extent on
    marketing are issues of considerable debate.

         And, with  the  average  prescription  cost   at  about  $17,
    according to a  1988  survey  of 1,850 pharmacies nationwide, many
    people are asking whether drug companies  ought  to devote some of
    its marketing budget to reducing drug prices.

         Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar Dr. Michael S. Wilkes of
    the University of  California  - Los Angeles estimates  that  drug
    companies spent more  than $2 billion on indirect marketing on the
    country's 479,000 doctors in 1988.






         While in  medical  school,  students  on  tight  budgets  are
    frequently invited to  lunches   or   dinners  sponsored  by  drug
    companies.  Many received  their  first stethoscope,  neurological
    hammer, penlight and doctor's black bag from a drug firm.

         According to  a  1982  study  of  85  Boston area physicians,
    however, marketing may have a much  stronger influence on doctors'
    prescribing behavior than doctors realize or admit.

         The study,  by  Dr. Jerry Avorn of the Department  of  Social
    Medicine and Health  Policy  at Harvard Medical School, found that
    the vast majority of doctors surveyed  said drug ads and marketing
    efforts were "minimally   important"  factors  influencing   their
    prescribing habits.

         The majority also believed that two heavily advertised drugs,
    vasodilators and propoxyphene  analgesics  (such  as Darvon), were
    effective treatments for senile  dementia  and  certain  kinds  of
    pain, respectively.   Meanwhile,    "the    clinical    literature
    overwhelmingly indicates that   they  are  not  useful  for  these
    indications," Avorn and  his  colleagues  wrote  in  the  American
    Journal of Medicine.

         The most controversial way companies market  to doctors is by
    sponsoring or underwriting  medical  education  seminars,  many of
    which offer continuing  medical   education   credits,  or  CMECs.
    Doctors need a certain number of CMECs to maintain their licenses.

         Occasionally, the seminars are held in enticing  locales such
    as Florida or  in  Colorado  during  ski  season.  Wealthier  drug
    companies may cover air fare and  accommodations  for doctors whom
    they perceive to  be  opinion  leaders  in  their   local  medical
    communities.

         In addition  to sponsoring seminars and buying advertisements
    in medical journals,   drug   firms    hire    armies   of   sales
    representatives, also known  as  "detail  personnel,"  to  conduct
    face-to-face sales pitches  with  any  doctor  who  will listen to
    them.

         Nearly every doctor's office  sports  an  array  of  desk-top
    items bearing a   drug   name  or  company  logo.     Personalized
    prescription pads, pens   and  paperweights  and  other  "reminder
    items" all come from detail people,  doctors  say.  In addition to
    the perks, detail  people  leave  behind medical literature,  free
    drug samples and patient-educational leaflets.

         One potential  way  to  neutralize  biased  sales  pitches is
    "academic detailing," according to  Avorn's  research. In academic
    detailing, a  doctor  learns  about  drugs from a university-based
    expert with no  allegiance  to  a  drug company.  These one-on-one
    meetings in the  doctor's office  are  even  more  effective  when
    supplemented by "unadvertisements," which point out a medication's
    adverse side effects  as  prominently  as  its benefits,  research
    suggests.

    I would suggests   two  books  to  read  that  give  an  excellent
    perspective view on this subject of drug companies and the
    medical profession.
