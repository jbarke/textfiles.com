                           Ion - Propelled Aircraft

                 An ion - generated wind will lift and propel
                  this incredible magic carpet of the future
                                By Hans Fantel

IT WAS DOWNRIGHT SPOOKY.  Without a sound, the peculiar, spiky contraption
rose straight up, hovered awhile, climbed higher. Then it did a few graceful
turns, stopped again, and just sat there silently in midair.

It seemed like levitation - some trick to overcome gravity. I could not shake
off the feeling that i was  attending  a kind of spiritual seance,  or maybe
a Buck  Rogers  show,  instead  of an engineering demonstration.   The eerie
scene  took place in the  big  barn  like laboratory of Electron-Atom Inc.,
research firm in Long Island City, New York, devoted to the development of a
new kind of flying machine.  I had been invited to watch a scale model being
put through its paces by remote  control.  What we saw  was  by  far  the
oddest  aircraft since  the  Wright Brothers' motorized kite.

It had no prop. No jet. No wings. In fact, it had no moving parts at all
looking somewhat like an old-fashioned bedspring, the rectangular rig is the
nearest thing to a magic carpet.  It needs no runway, takes off vertically and
is expected to climb as high as 60 miles. It can crawl through the air like a
snail, or go faster than a jet. Nobody yet knows the speed limit.

After a while, I closed my mouth. But David Yorysh, one of the project
engineers, noticed my puzzlement.

                     "Any questions?" he grinned.
                     "Yes. What holds it up?"
                     "Ions," said Yorysh, as he launched
                      into an explanation of a wholly new
                      flight concept.

The magic carpet, called the Ionocraft, flies on pure electricity.  It depends
specifically on the fundamental principle of electricity that electric current
always flows from negative to positive, and it uses two basic pieces of
equipment to take advantage of this principle - tall metal spikes that are
installed above an open wire-mesh grid.

High negative voltage is shot from the spikes toward the positively charged
wire grid, just like negative and positive poles on an ordinary battery.  As
the negative charge leaves the spike arms, it peppers the surrounding air like
buckshot, putting a negative charge on some of the air particles. Such
negatively charged air particles are called ions,  and these are attracted
downward by the positively charged grid.

"Okay," I said. "But I  still  don't see what  holds it up."   "I'm getting to
that,"  Yorysh  assured me as he spelled out the rest of the Ionocraft
principle. In their  mad rush from the ion emitter to the  main grid,  the
ions  bump  into  neutral  air  molecules-air particles  without  electric
charge. The terrific wallop  in  these collisions  hurls a mass  of neutral
air down-ward along with ions.  When they reach that air grid, the  ions being
negative are trapped by positive charge  on the grid. but  the  grid  has  no
attraction for the  neutral  air particles  that got  bumped along. So the air
flows right through the open grid mesh, making a downdraft  beneath the
Ionocraft.  The contraption rides on this shaft of air, getting lift just like
a helicopter - by sucking air down from the top.

"Aerodynamically, it works just like a chopper,"  Yorysh  summed  it up.  "But
instead  of  using  a  rotor  and  blades,  we  create the downward air flow
electrically by means of ionic discharge. the ions act on the air like a man
treading water. They just push down."

The engineers working on Ionocraft are the first to admit that their present
rig is still a long way from any kind of practical aircraft.  the model we saw
measures only 1296  square  inches  and consists of about $5 worth  of balsa
wood and aluminum wire. But  the  principle holds an important promise for the
future of aviation.

The problem now is improving efficiency - getting enough lift from a given
grid area  and a given amount of energy, Present models cannot yet lift their
own electric generators.  they  get  power  through a feeder cable, dangling
down  like  an  umbilical   cord.  Ionocraft engineers tend to  be close-
mouthed on performance figures.

But they will tell you that at present it takes  90  watts (30,000 volts at 3
milliamperes) to fly  a  two ounce model.  translated  into  ordinary power-
to-weight ratios, this works out to roughly .96 hp. per pound, as compared
with a typical .1 hp per pound of helicopter or .065  hp for a pound Piper
Cub.

But Ionocraft designers are hard  at  work  upping  efficiency.  One possible
power - boosting technique is to pulse the  power  in short high energy bursts
rather  than apply steady voltage. They are also trying out various grid
patterns and ion emitter layouts to minimize energy loss through turbulence in
the downdraft.

Despite such unresolved problems, the development crew  almost bristles with
optimism, and the most optimistic of all is the Ionocraft's inventor Major
Alexander P. de Seversky.  No crackpot, Major de Seversky is a practical
visionary who in many areas has been far in front of his field.

"We hope to fly a model with self-contained power, perhaps by the end of the
year," he told me, confidently. "Ultimately, the ionic drive will prove more
efficient than either propeller or jet as a method of aircraft propulsion.

"It will achieve lift at less expenditure of energy and fuel than existing
form of aircraft. In fact, it will prove the most efficient method of
converting electricity into motion."

Coming from a man of de Seversky's background, such a statement has an almost
prophetic ring. A leading aircraft designer and ace flyer for the past 50
years, de Seversky's idea's have often been ahead of their time- sometimes  to
the embarrassment of other aviation experts.  Losing his right leg during his
first flying mission in World War I didn't deter him from downing 13 enemy
aircraft in later flights. After coming to the United States from Russia, de
Seversky developed bombsights and course computers during the 1920s that were
the forerunners of today's inertial guidance systems.

    Worked with Billy Mitchell

Later he pioneered the design of the cantilever-skin stressed wing that is now
in general use.  He was consultant to General Billy Mitchell in the historic
airplane-verses battleship tactical experiments of the 1920s, and as a special
consultant to the U.S. Chiefs of Staff helped formulate basic air strategy in
World War II.  He also contributed to the designs of the P-35 and P-43 which
led to the development of the P-47 Thunderbolt, one of America's most
effective wartime fighter planes.   Now a trim and sprightly man of 70, he
still likes to take out experimental jet planes for a spin.

"The idea hit me as I was working on an electric air-cleaning device which I
had invented," the major recalled. "That gadget was designed to fight air
pollution by electrically charging the particles in industrial smoke and then
trapping them on a liquid  electrode with the opposite charge."  De Seversky
noticed an air flow developing between the two electrodes, caused by
ionization process previous explained. "To an old flyer like me," said the
major, "anything that stirs up a wind is a flying machine. So I began to
develop the idea." The major seemed concerned that the Ionocraft might be
mistaken for a kind of space vehicle.

"This is not a spacecraft," he explained emphatically to forestall any
misunderstanding. "It's an airplane, designed to operate within the
atmosphere. But it will be able to do things no present type aircraft can
accomplish."

Pointing out the potential advantage of Ionocraft over conventional planes or
helicopters, de Seversky ticks of a whole string of radical notions:

High-altitude flight. Helicopters whirl their blades in utter frustration at
altitudes where the air gets thin. Beyond 20,000 feet, they get almost no
lift. By contrast, experts calculate that Ionocraft can kick up (rather kick
down) enough air to stay aloft at 300,000 feet.

Unlimited size. The bigger it gets the better it flies. Efficiency increases
with grid area. Distributing airflow around the grid edge becomes
proportionately less important in larger craft. the reason:

  Grid area increases faster than circumference with growing  size.

"We'll be able to build them as big as a city block"  claimed de Seversky.

High speed. No practical speed limit has been determined. The ions themselves
            flash from emitter to grid impart to the very high-velocity
            impulse.  Aerodynamic drag would be the chief speed-limiting
            factor.  But, streamlining of the grid edge and careful contouring
            of the craft, could minimize air drag.

Safety. No moving parts in propulsion and no wear, means less chance of
        failure, simpler maintenance.

    Steering with Voltage

Steering control is accomplished by applying different voltages to various
parts of the craft. The part with the high voltage gets more lift, hence tilts
up. The form of the Ionocraft does not matter. Any shape will fly, but de
Seversky assumes that round models in the from of a flying saucer will be the
most easily manuverable.

By a simple joystick control, the pilot can lift any edge of the craft,
producing pitch and roll as if the Ionocraft had elevators and ailerons. He
can put the craft into any flight attitude-noise up or down, or banking to
either side. Like the tilt of a helicopter rotor, this inclination pushes the
craft forward, rearward, or sideways.

J.F. Bruno, the technical director of de Seversky's staff, spoke of a
passenger gondola in future models, suspended from gimbals below the main grid
so that it remains level regardless of how the main deck is tilted.  Locations
below the main grid also shields passengers from high energy  flow.  But, even
if the passengers somehow got into the ion stream, it wouldn't electrocute
them unless they got "grounded" to the main grid.  "It would be just like
birds sitting on a wire," said Yorysh, the man in charge of electronic design.

Until patents for Ionocraft were firmly nailed, de Seversky kept his ideas
carefully under raps.  That's another reason no full-scale prototype has yet
been built. But even present scale models set the imagination buzzing.  Manned
craft are envisioned for:

       Commuter transport, With no size limit, you can pack  trainloads  of
       people into this VTOL craft, relieve traffic congestion around urban
       centers. The type  of craft used as long-distance transport possibly
       at supersonic speeds-would not need big airports with long run ways.

       Airborne traffic monitors.  Hovering above bridges and major
       intersections, or patrolling above highways, one-man Ionocraft would
       provide a panoramic view of traffic conditions, radio information to
       ground traffic-control centers.

    Grid Is Hard to Hit

       Military reconnaissance and rescue.  Without moving parts, the
       Ionocraft is less vulnerable to small-arms fire than helicopters.
       the open grid  makes a poor target. Most bullets would whizz right
       through it. Even if the grid is hit, the electric charge would be
       maintained despite the damage to some portions. Unlike a copter with
       shattered blades, the Ionocraft would not crash.

       Weather observation. While satellites like Tiros look down on the
       atmosphere from outer space. Ionocraft could sail right into the
       weather-making air layers, providing valuable supplemental information.
       Being steerable, Ionocraft would not drift with the wind like weather
       balloons, but could hold a position over crucial areas, making local
       forecasts more reliable.

       Skyborne antenna, kept aloft indefinitely in a fixed position by ground
       based energy supply. Ionocraft could also act as a skyborne antenna,
       extending the range of defense radar. "It would be like raising the
       DEW-line 60 miles up into the air," suggested de Seversky, "adding 15
       to 25 minutes warning time against missiles."

       Anti-missile machine. Always alert to military tactics, de Seversky
       believes that Ionocraft could be used as missile interceptors.
       Normally the craft would hover at high altitudes, scanning the horizon
       for a 700-mile range. As soon as it spotted and identified a hostile
       missiles through an infrared detection system, the Ionocraft would hurl
       itself at the enemy rocket on a collision course and blow it out of the
       air.

       When practical craft are built, their designers expect to have a choice
       of several power supply systems now under development for NASA's space
       program. Some of these include:

       Gas-turbine generators. Several firms, notably General Electric and
       Allis-Chalmers, have come up with compact, light weight, kerosene-
       fueled turbines, originally intended as power sources for spacecraft.
       These may be used to generate electricity aboard Ionocraft.

       Fuel cells. these are chemical reactors producing electricity like a
       storage battery, but drawing their chemicals from external supply
       tanks. NASA is currently testing fuel cells converting hydrogen and
       oxygen to electricity, with drinking water as a byproduct.

       Solar cells, directly convert sunlight to electricity-the present
       energy source of most satellites.  When  high-efficiency solar cells
       are available, they may keep Ionocraft aloft for indefinite periods.

                            Power from Boiling Mercury

       Sunflower - a  code  name  for  another  project aimed  at  deriving
       electric power directly  from  sunlight. It employs an umbrella-like
       reflector that focuses the sun's heat to boil mercury, which expands
       through a turbine  and  drives an electric  generator.  (Solar-power
       supplies would be back-stopped by other kinds of power generators to
       take over whenever no sunlight is available.)

       Microwave radiation. Concentrated   beams  of  high-frequency  radio
       waves may transfer energy from ground  stations  to the Ionocraft if
       the craft is to be used as a hovering platform in a  fixed position.
       Raytheon has pioneered this type of energy transmission  through its
       Amplitron tube and  has  recaptured  as  much  as  72 percent of the
       radiated energy at the receiver site.  High-power laser beams may be
       similarly used for transmission.

       Experimental hardware has already been produced for  each  of  these
       off-beat power-supply systems.

       None of the men working on the Ionocraft will be pinned down to any
       production timetable. "It's a pretty wild project," admitted technical
       director Bruno, a veteran 20 years in the missile business. "But that's
       what they said when we started working on rockets."

       Major de Seversky, whose own career goes back to the beginnings of
       aviation, views his invention in historical perspective:

       "We are exploring an entirely new principle of flight. We're just at
       the spot where the Wright Brothers were in 1903.  We are just beginning
       to see the possibilities."

             ION - PROPULSION is produced when negative charge from
             upright arms charges surrounding air particles into ions.
             Negatively charged  ions  rush  toward positively  charged
             grid, pushing neutral air particles before them

                     GRID.  DOWN WASH KEEPS IONOCRAFT ALOFT
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       MAJOR DE SEVERSKY became interested in ion propulsion when he noticed
       air flow between two electrodes while working on another of his
       inventions.

       IONOCRAFT MODEL takes to air, completely unsupported except for
       downwash of air. Next step is to develop model that can carry its own
       power supply

       IONOCRAFT COMMUTER maybe solution for suburbanites of the future in
       congested areas, speeding hundreds of them short distances over heavy
       city traffic. Power would be supplied by chain of ground-based master
       stations.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ONE MAN IONOCRAFT could be tomorrow's traffic patrol car or, in combat,
       hovering vehicle for guerrilla wars, all but impervious to some minor
       grid damage
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       ANTI-MISSILE IONOCRAFT, powered by sunlight, could hover indefinitely
       in upper atmosphere, then home in on incoming warhead and blast it out
       of sky.

       Vangard Notes...

            This file was updated October 30th, 1993 when the MAJORDE1.GIF
            was uploaded to us.

            One more point of interest here based on modern developments is
            the invention of the RECTENNA.  This is an antenna array that
            is mounted on the flying machine and RECEIVES high density
            microwave transmissions FROM a ground transmitter.

            The antenna has a built-in diode network that rectifies the
            alternating current into direct current.  Note the Ionocraft
            requires 30,000 volts at about 3 milliamperes (90 WATTS) which
            is relatively LOW when speaking of high voltages.  This could
            be achieved in multiple ways.

            As stated in the text, the larger the surface area of the grid,
            the GREATER the weight (payload) the craft can lift.  The idea
            of an attached gondola to the bottom of the craft would not
            only provide for a payload carrying area but also help to
            stabilize the craft much as a basket beneath a balloon.

            A final comparison is the work of Townsend Brown with the
            Bifeld/Brown Effect.  It requires a minimum of 50,000 volts,
            again with the larger payloads requiring higher voltages.
            Spin can also increase the payload capacityby vortex
            amplification.
