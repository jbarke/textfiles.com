                                       KEELY

                   "In questions of Science the Authority of
                    a Thousand is not worth the humble reasoning
                    of a single individual."

            The "Scientific  American"  in  their  January   28,  1899,  and
       February 4, 1899,  issues  spent  four  pages debunking Keely and his
       experiments.  However, they would have spent even more time and pages
       debunking our current semiconductors  and other now-common scientific
       inventions if someone had been able to come up with  any  of  them at
       that time--science and  technology  were  not advanced enough then to
       understand the sophisticated functioning  of  such  items.   Now,  in
       light of our advances and our greater understanding and hopefully our
       more broadened outlook in the field of science, I think  it  behooves
       us to look  again at John Keely, the man and his experiments, and see
       if perhaps he was just ahead of his  time  and  that now there may be
       premises we can  utilize or lines of research we can  pursue  to  our
       great advantage.

            The entire thesis of the "Scientific American" articles was that
       Keely's scientific career  had  been  nothing  but a series of frauds
       perpetrated on gullible, unthinking  people  who  were  incapable  of
       understand ng enough science  to  disprove his wild  claims.  (1,2,3)
       This in spite  of  the fact that many noted men of science, including
       such as Joseph M. Leidy, M.D., of  Pennsylvania  University, James M.
       Wilcox, M.D., author and noted physician, and many others, thoroughly
       examined Keely's inventions,  his  laboratory,  and   the  scientific
       demonstrations performed by  Keely  and  could  find  no fraud of any
       kind.  In fact they were completely  convinced  as to the validity of
       Keely's achievements and his competence in the scientific method. (4)

       GRAVITY AND KEELY'S "AERIAL PROPELLER"

            The basis for the cries of fraud centered around  the finding of
       a large hollow iron sphere "hidden" under the floor boards of Keely's
       laboratory.

            After Keely's   untimely   death   several   investigators  from
       "Scientific American" went  to Keely's  old  laboratory  looking  for
       evidence to support  their fraud thesis. (2)  They thought  they  had
       found what they  were  looking  for  when  they  lifted  a  couple of
       floorboards and found  a large (four  feet  in  diameter)  cast  iron
       sphere from which protruded pieces of broken pipe.   The  sphere  was
       estimated to weigh  6,625  pounds  and  have  a  bursting strength of
       28,000 pounds per square inch.

            This event revived the charge  brought  against  him  during his
       lifetime of using  compressed  air to perform  his miraculous   feats
       which if true  could  have earned Keely a fortune from compressed air
       inventions.

            A newspaper  article  written while Keely was still living tells
       the story of the iron sphere.  It seems  that the newshound who wrote
       the article had   gone   to   see   Keely  for  possible   newsworthy
       information.  He found the inventor in his laboratory tearing a large
       hole in the floor.  Keely greeted the reporter but did not seem to be
       in a talkative  mood  as he appeared quite busy.  After enlarging the
       hole, Keely attached a strange belt  with  several  mechanisms  built
       into it to his waist.  He then attached a thin wire  leading from the
       belt to a large sphere resting in the corner of the laboratory.

            After a  few  moments  of  intense  concentration  by  Keely the
       ponderous globe slowly lifted a few  inches  from  the  floor.  Keely
       then "floated" the  iron sphere over to the hole in  the  floorboards
       and allowed the  huge  mass  to settle gently to the ground below the
       floor level.  After a few adjustments  to  the  belt  mechanism Keely
       again seemed lost in rapt concentration.  This time  the globe slowly
       but inexorably settled  itself into the earth, buried by the opposite
       of levitation; namely, supergravity.   Keely had evidently caused the
       apparent mass of  the sphere to increase to such an  extent  that  it
       sank into the  firm  earth  much as a heavy rock sinks into mud.  The
       inventor told the reporter that he  was merely making room in his lab
       and clearing away outmoded equipment.

            This demonstration of Keely's control of gravity should have put
       to bed forever  the  humbug about compressed air but  people  believe
       pretty much as  they want or are told to believe.  Keely had used the
       sphere many years previous as a storage  reservoir  for etheric vapor
       but improvements in  force  generation  obsoleted the  necessity  for
       storage. (4)  He  was  by  then  able  to  conduct  the force through
       specially treated wires made of precious metals. (4)

            While Major Ricarde-Seaver,  F.R.S.,  was  in  Philadelphia,  he
       witnessed this same gravity belt in operation.  The  Major  saw Keely
       move a large 500 horsepower vibratory engine from one part of his lab
       to another.  The  astounded  engineer  pronounced the feat impossible
       without the aid of a crane which would  have meant the removal of the
       roof of the  laboratory.  The gravity belt was but one  step  towards
       Keely's "airship" or "aerial navigator" as he called it. (4)

            By 1896 Keely had perfected his system to the point where he had
       built and demonstrated  his  airship  to the press as well as the War
       Department (now the Department of Defense).  The craft was a circular
       platform about 6 feet in diameter.  (11)   Mounted  on it was a small
       stool placed before  a  keyboard.  Attached to the  keyboard  were  a
       collection of finely    tuned   resonation   plates   and   vibratory
       mechanisms. (14)  Keely  explained   that   when  these  plates  were
       polarized with "negative attraction" the craft would  rise  and float
       above the ground.  (11)  The craft was now under the influence of the
       etheric polar current.  By damping out certain notes Keely caused the
       airship to accelerate  to  any desired  speed.  (11)   When  the  War
       Department witnessed his demonstration in an open field  the  airship
       went from zero  velocity  to 500 miles per hour within a few seconds.
       There were NO ACCELERATION EFFECTS  TO  KEELY  who was sitting before
       the keyboard on  the  stool  in  the  open  air and  controlling  the
       airship.  The government  officials, although impressed, could see no
       use for the complex device so did not pursue the matter further.

       N.C., until December 17, 1903--7 years later!)

            The controlling  mechanism  consisted  of a row of 100 vibratory
       bars representing the enharmonic and  diatonic  scales.  When half of
       the bars were damped the craft would move at 500 miles  per hour.  If
       all the bars  were damped, gravity would resume control and the craft
       would settle to the earth. (14)

            There were no moving parts in  the  ship's propelling mechanism.
       It was unaffected by weather as it could rise above  any  storm.  The
       instrument for guiding  the airship was distinctly different from the
       propelling feature.

            A vast improvement over greasy automobiles, noisy airplanes, and
       brute force space rockets which hadn't even been invented yet!!!
       You might think we have regressed  instead  of  progressed in our so-
       called "space-age".

       THE MAN KEELY

            John Ernst Worrell Keely may well have been one  of the greatest
       scientists of all  time.   And  it  is unfortunate that so few people
       even know his  name,  much  less  the   scientific  system  which  he
       developed.  He is  listed  in  the encyclopedia (8)  as  a  fake  and
       imposter who tried    to   hoodwink   the   public   and   scientific
       establishment of his day.

            "KEELY, John Ernest<* Worrell, American adventurer:
             born - Philadelphia, Pa., September 3, 1837<**
             died - Philadelphia, Pa., November 18, 1898
             In early life he was a carpenter.  Prior to 1872
             he became interested in music, and afterward claimed
             that the tuning fork had suggested to him a new
             motive power.  In 1874 a stock company was formed for
             the purpose of supplying funds for the perfection and
             promotion of the alleged discovery.  Keely built and
             destroyed many models, gave exhibitions at which
             numerous remarkable and unexplained effects were
             produced, but never attained any important result.
             Upon his death it was found that the so-called Keely
             motor was operated by an invisible compressed air
             apparatus, and that the entire scheme was fraudulent.(8)

                    * (author's note : Ernst is the correct spelling)
                   ** (author's note : 1827 is correct date of birth)

            Keely's parents died in an epidemic  when he was still a boy and
       he was raised by grandparents.  His grandfather, Ernst,  had  been  a
       composer who led   the   Baden-Baden   orchestra  in  Germany  before
       immigrating to Philadelphia.  Ernst  quickly  found that his grandson
       was a prodigy on the violin and gave him much help  in  learning  the
       fundamentals of music.

            A musical  career  did not appeal to the adventuresome genius as
       he found the science of vibrations upon which music is based a much

       greater attraction.  Keely was intrigued with the famous statement by
       Paganini that he  could, given the mass chord of a bridge, destroy it
       by playing the mass chord on his violin. (4)

            One interesting (but unverified)  story about Keely concerns the
       time he built his first free-energy motor--while still  a  young boy.
       It was a  series  of  17  conch  shells,  8  affixed to a small wheel
       forming the rotor.  The stator consisted  of 9 conches affixed around
       the outer periphery  of the wheel but not attached  to  the  rotating
       wheel.  John had  ground  the shells so that they were all attuned to
       the same frequency.  When the "motor"  was  put  together  the  wheel
       slowly rotated on  its  axis,  clunking  and  clicking   because   of
       imbalances, but nevertheless   self-operative.   John's  enterprising
       nature led him to the idea of putting  the entire assembly into a box
       and charging his neighbor friends a penny to look inside  to  see the
       wheel turning.  Impossible you say?--well a research scientist in Los
       Angeles, Dr. Ruth  Drown,  has claimed that a special log spiral (the
       same curve in a conch shell) gives  off  a  strange energy emanation.
       (15)

            While yet  a  young man, Keely learned carpentry  and  used  his
       income to pursue  his  experiments  in  sound vibrations.  About 1866
       while he was pursuing a line of experimentation  in sonic vibrations,
       he discovered a hitherto unknown energy.  He was subjecting  water to
       sonic vibrations and  had  an  explosion which wrecked his apparatus.
       Six years of intensive experiments  passed  before  he  was  able  to
       produce this energy  at  will.  He found that 42,800  vibrations  per
       second would vaporize  water  instantly  into  energy. (11)  He named
       this energy ETHERIC FORCE.  Keely called  the process of changing the
       substance of water into etheric force : DISSOCIATION. (6)

       KEELY MOTOR COMPANY

            During the course of these experiments Keely had  exhausted  his
       resources so he  sought  financial  aid.  In 1872 he demonstrated the
       production of etheric force, by dissociation  of  water  using  sound
       vibration, to a group of Philadelphia businessmen who were interested
       in the possible  use  of  etheric  force  to  power  an  engine.  (4)
       Witnessing the lifting   of   large  masses  and  the  production  of
       pressures up to 20,000 pounds per  square  inch  and  reversing  to a
       standard atmospheric pressure of 30 inches of mercury with no heat or
       cold brought visions  of a power to supplant steam that  induced  the
       men to organize  a company around Keely's discovery. (4)  Its primary
       goal was to design and develop an  engine  utilizing etheric force as
       the motive power.  It was called the Keely Motor Company chartered in
       1874.  The company  proved to be nothing but a burden  to  Keely  and
       practically no financial assistance.  He was ot a businessman and it
       did not interest  him  so  the  Keely  Motor  Company  was eventually
       dissolved.

            During the Keely Motor Company  episode  Keely  was sustained in
       his research and personal needs by a few close friends  who  believed
       in the value  of  his  work.   This enabled him to pursue his beloved
       research on a sparse budget.

            Later on  Mrs. Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, widow of a wealthy
       paper manufacturer, and well-known writer, came to Keely's rescue and
       financed his continued research on  an  expanded  scale.  During this
       time Keely lived at 909 Walnut Street in Philadelphia  with  his wife
       Anna.  Mrs. Moore  payed the mortgage on Keely's house and gave him a
       personal income so he could work uninterrupted on his discoveries.

            The only well-known record of  Keely and his researches, to this
       day, is a biography written by Mrs. Moore to acquaint  the world with
       Keely's discoveries. (4)   If  one  is  interested in Keely's system,
       time spent in researching the references  alluded to in KEELY AND HIS
       DISCOVERIES by Mrs. Moore is very rewarding.  (Available  from Health

       VERIFICATION OF FREQUENCY TO PRODUCE ETHERIC FORCE FROM WATER ?

            A recent  (1965)  possible  verification  of the frequency Keely
       used to dissociate water into etheric  force  was  related to me by a
       scientist when we were discussing certain aspects of free energy.  He
       wishes to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, but  his  name  is on
       file.  I have  no  other  verification  of this experiment, however I
       believe it merits telling.

            The scientist, I shall call  him  Dr.  X,  was doing experiments
       with ultrasonic sound  in  a  column  of water.  The  object  of  the
       experiments was to  devise a means of separating various densities of
       materials by injecting  them  into   a  column  of  water  which  was
       subjected to an ultrasonic standing wave vibration.  The experimental
       setup is sketched in Figure 3-3 (for BBS considerations a description
       follows).

            A Barium Titanate ultrasonic transducer was fixed  to the bottom
       of a quartz  tube which was closed at the bottom and open at the top.
       Pure water was poured into the tube  and the water column was "tuned"
       so that a  standing  wave  was  produced  at 40,000 CPS  (cycles  per
       second).  The transducer  was  powered  by a 700 Watt power amplifier
       which was driven by an ultrasonic  frequency  generator.   Because of
       the large amount  of  power put into the column of  water  a  certain
       amount of evaporation   took  place  at  a  constant  rate  when  the
       transducer was energized.  Therefore,  to maintain a standing wave in
       the water column a feedback device caused the frequency  to be raised
       as the water evaporated and the temperature changed.

            As a test, Dr. X decided to run through the experiment with only
       water in the  tube  to  insure that a standing wave was maintained as
       the water evaporated and the frequency  rose higher and higher.  When
       the experiment was started everything worked beautifully.  Dr. X took
       periodic readings of  his instrumentation and was  assured  that  the
       standing wave was   being  maintained.   Suddenly,  with  no  warning
       whatever the water disappeared from  the open quartz tube.  He looked
       up thinking to  see  the water splashed on the ceiling  when  to  his
       amazement a clean  hole went right through the ceiling.  The hole was
       the same size   as  the  inside  of   the   quartz   tube.    Further
       investigation showed the  hole continued on through  the  roof  also!
       Dr. X checked his notebook and found the last frequency entry to be


                                       Page 5







       41,300 CPS.  It  was  shortly  after this that the water disappeared.
       Because of the  time  interval  between  the  last  reading  and  the
       disappearing water, the frequency sent to the transducer  was  higher
       than the last  reading  and  Dr.  X said it could well have been very
       close to 42,800 CPS, the Keely dissociation  frequency.   (11)   This
       obviously dangerous event caused Dr. X to dismantle the equipment and
       try some other approach to his problem.  This experiment  points  the
       way to the  use  of our modern technology in conjunction with Keely's
       laws of dissociation to change matter  into energy without the use of
       radioactive materials or extremely expensive atomic accelerators.

       THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE

            From Keely's first "accidental" dissociation of  water, reducing
       atoms to pure  energy or etheric force as Keely called it, in 1866 to
       his conscious ability to manipulate  gravity, magnetism, electricity,
       and controlled use of etheric force by 1898, when he  was killed by a
       streetcar, all was  one  long, sustained, herculean effort to bring a
       humanity a costless motive power which  would free man from drudgery.
       Mrs. Moore described Keely's efforts from 1866 to 1880  as  his "dead
       work". (4)  Every  discoverer  has  to carry on a period of this dead
       work.  In this  period  the discoverer  is  building  up  his  ideas,
       experiments, and knowledge into an intelligible system,  working  out
       the basic principles,  and  establishing a firm foundation upon which
       to build a completed system.  The  work  is not complete to the point
       of ceasing experimentation and publishing the work to the world.  The
       work is not known to the world during this time;  hence,  it  is  not
       alive, but dead.

            By 1872,  Keely had learned the laws of sympathetic vibration to
       the extent of being able to dissociate  water  and  air  into etheric
       vapor.  Roughly translated  into  modern  physics   he  was  able  to
       HARMONIOUSLY change matter  into  pure  energy<*.   He  was  able  to
       generate pressures of 20,000 pounds  per  square inch and to use this
       force to lift  huge  weights.   Keely made the first  truly  "atomic"
       cannon.  It was  a  simple,  old  style  mortar  using  a "charge" of
       etheric force to send a lead projectile  on  its  course.   A refined
       version of this  cannon was demonstrated before members  of  the  War
       Department in 1884.  (2)   Their  only  comment  was  that it was too
       complicated for them to understand.

            During this dead work period,  explosions  occurred  many times,
       some harmless, others  disabling Keely for weeks at  a  time.   Using
       sound vibrations to  dissociate  water,  he was able to evolve almost
       instantly a pressure varying from  10,000  to 20,000 PSI.  This force
       during some demonstrations was discharged into the  air  without  the
       evolution of heat  in  its  production or cold when released into the
       air.  This showed  to  the  skeptical  scientists  who  observed  the
       demonstrations that the force was not simply compressed  air  as many
       tried to claim.

            The period  from  1872 to 1882 absorbed all Keely's thoughts and
       energies in developing an engine utilizing  etheric force.  Two years
       were lost in  efforts  to  devise automatic arrangements  that  would
       enable Keely's machinery  to be handled by any operator.  During this
       period Keely was at a loss to explain  why  he  was  having  so  much
       difficulty in his development of a universally useable motor system.

            At this  critical  juncture,  Mrs.  J.  F. Hughes (grandniece of
       Charles Darwin) heard of Keely's  researches  and  sent  him her book
       "The Evolutions of Tones and ¼olours".  The fllowing  statement from
       that book helped to re-direct Keely's efforts:

                 "The Law which develops and controls harmony,
                  develops and controls the Universe."

       About the same  time  Mrs. Moore gave Keely Professor John MacVicar's
       "Sketch of a Philosophy or Ether  the  True  Protoplasm".   These two
       definitive books set Keely on a firm philosophical  basis  and raised
       the veil that  enabled  him to manipulate gravity, inertia, cohesion,
       momentum, electricity, and magnetism,  plus  many  other forces Keely
       discovered.

       WHY KEELY IS UNKNOWN TODAY

            There are several reasons why  Keely's  magnificent  discoveries
       are unknown today.   Greed and selfishness of the stock  manipulators
       in the Keely Motor Company caused suspicion to be cast on Keely which
       reduced his effective    audience.    Greedy   investors   tried   to
       commercialize Keely's discoveries  too  soon  and  hindered his every
       step of progress.

            Pride and  jealousy  from  noted  men of science,  such  as  Sir
       William Thompson and   Lord  Raleigh,  who  refused  to  witness  the
       production of Gther@c  force,  kept   Keely  from  getting  competen
       supporters.  Men of  "science"  seem  to  be slowest  in  recognizing
       truths after they  have been discovered, especially if the discovered
       does not have recognized professional credentials.  Keely had no such
       credentials since he did not even  finish  high school.  Two thousand
       years elapsed between  Pythagoras' (497 B.C.) discoveries  and  their
       revival by Copernicus  (1500  A.D.).   Tycho  Brahe  (1546-1601)  the
       famous Danish astronomer,  opposed  the  Pythagorean  system  to  his
       deathbed.  Galileo (1564-1642) adopted it and demonstrated  it in all
       its purity.  His   reward   was  torture  by  the  officials  of  the
       Inquisition.  It seems that those who espouse truth do so in the face
       of possible death at the hands of those who will not see.

            Keely was continually plagued  by  those who knew nothing of his
       science.  So-called reputable  men  of  the scientific  establishment
       ridiculed and downgraded  his  efforts calling him a fraud and a liar
       when they had not even extended  him  the  courtesy  of  attending  a
       demonstration.

            Keely's worst  enemy,  however,  was himself.   He  was  a  poor
       businessman.  He allowed   the  stock  manipulators  to  exploit  his
       discoveries and leave him penniless.   His refusal to allow anyone to
       touch his equipment caused any to accuse him of fraud.  At first when
       he did try to teach others to use his equipment and  produce  results
       he was unsuccessful; but in 1884 he had established a thorough basis


                                       Page 7







       for his discoveries  and  was  able  to  build  a Liberator which his
       lawyer, Mr. Collier, and his lawyer's  brother  George, could operate
       to produce etheric vapor.  Until then it was required  that  Keely at
       least place his hands upon an operator to make the equipment operate.
       (4)

       KEELY'S SUPPORTERS

            There were  those  who  did see the truth of Keely's discoveries
       and were honest enough to admit it to the world.

            Major Ricarde-Seaver, Fellow of  the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
       went to visit  Keely in Philadelphia to convince himself  as  to  the
       real nature of  Keely's  accomplishments.  After thoroughly examining
       his system Ricarde-Seaver returned  to England saying that "Keely was
       working with, and had apparent command over forces,  the  nature,  or
       even the very  existence of which, was absolutely unknown to him, and
       so far as he is aware to modern science." (4)

            Supporters of distinction included  Professor  Jeseph  M. Leidy,
       M.D., of Pennsylvania University, awarded Lyell Medal in 1884 when in
       London and the  Cuvier  Award  in  1888  from the French  Academy  of
       Science when in  France.  Also  James  M.  Wilcox,  M.D.,  author  of
       "Rational Cosmology". They  witnessed   Keely's   demonstrations   of
       sending etheric force  through wires of gold, silver,  and  platinum,
       and running various laboratory apparatus. After the demonstration the
       wire was cut up and given to them for inspection. The wire was solid;
       therefore, compressed air was not responsible.  (4)

            Among those  who  witnessed  Keel's production of energy in 1872
       were men who knew the worth of Keely's research and who furnished
       him with money and encouraged him  to  persevere. The book Mrs. Moore
       gave Keely led  him  to the conviction that he was  in  another  road
       infinitely more important  than invention; namely, the source of life
       and the connecting link between intelligence,  will, and matter. when
       he changed his goals from invention to pure research his progress was
       almost uninterrupted.

            Keely's original mistake was pursuing invention instead of basic
       research. For 15 years Keely tried to build an engine  using  etheric
       force as a motive power until he discovered that it is impossible
       to use the  ether in any other way than as a medium for other forces.
       These forces have to do with the polar  stream  of  the earth and are
       tuned to by  Keely's  system  of  "sympathetic  vibration"  (i.e.  by
       resonance of certain  harmonic  chords).  In  following  a  course of
       research in resonance phenomenon,  Keely  achieved  a  very  advanced
       understanding of the universe.

       CONTRIBUTIONS AND DISCOVERIES

             By 1885  Keely  had almost complete command of  all  the  known
       forces of the  phenomenonal  universe.  With  his  machinery he could
       generate magnetism in  any  substance,   levitate  any  substance  by
       controlling gravity, etherealize (reduce to energy) any substance and
       accurately explain all the atomic forces known to our  modern science
       but unknown in his time. Keely was finishing his theory on color and


                                       Page 8







       sound and could  see  the  time  when he would be able to publish his
       system and have the proper apparatus  for  demonstration and analysis
       of "all the progressive links of transmissive sympathy from the crude
       molecular to the  high  etheric."  Even the journals  had  ceased  to
       ridicule and some were stating to publish on the "possibilities lying
       hidden in the discovery of an unknown force".

            After a   lifetime   of   researching  the  laws  governing  the
       vibrations which produce etheric force, Keely believed that the power
       he tapped was  the governing  medium  of  the  universe.  This  force
       controls the advance  and recession of the sum and planets  in  their
       movements across the  heavens.  It  reigns in the mineral, vegetable,
       and animal kingdoms and is the common fore regulating all.

            Keely proved in demonstration  that  matter can be subdivided by
       different orders of vibration. Each subdivision evolves  entirely new
       and distinct "elements". He was able to analyze seven distinct levels
       of subdivision. Perhaps  this is an affirmation of the occultists who
       have proclaimed that  there are seven  levels  of  universal  energy.
       Present atom smashers  with  their  billion  volt power  levels  have
       nothing new on Keely's harmonious control and subdivision of matter.

            He showed that all sympathetic streams of energy are composed of
       triple currents of   vibratory   flows.  This  applies  to  magnetic,
       electric, gravital, and cerebelic (brain  and mind) flows. These laws
       govern all molecular  masses  from the innermost subdivision  of  the
       atom to the  galaxies  and  universe itself. These flows radiate from
       suns and stars to planets on down  the  scale to the very core of the
       atoms. Since these flows are vibrational in nature and tuned to their
       respective spheres Keely  believed this was the basis  for  the  term
       "music of the spheres".

            Gravity is  actually a triple connective radiation rather than a
       flow. It is an eternally existing force entering all forms of matter.
       Keely believed that gravity is the basic source form which all matter
       emerges.

            Keely called the stream of energy  coming  into the earth at the
       poles form the sun the polar stream. The three currents  of  force in
       this poles stream are magnetism, electricity, and gravity. (4)

            From all of Keely's experiments and research he determined and
       wrote out a   system   of  the  vibratory  conditions  governing  the
       aggregation of energy into molecular  structures  and their resonance
       relations to each  other.  (4)  The bulk of his scientific  treatises
       have been lost to the world. Except for Mrs. Moore's biography on him
       the world considers  his system lost; however, Keely communicated the
       basic laws of his system to his close  friend, William J. Colville, a
       publisher and student  of  metaphysics  and  a well-known  author  of
       metaphysical literature. Colville  embodied  Keely's  system  into  a
       little-known metaphysical novel entitled Dashed Against the Rock.
       It is a romance of a young "establishment"  scientist  who  is led by
       steps and stages  to  an  acceptance  of  the  laws governing  mental
       science. He is given instruction by a character who represents Keely,
       Mr. Aldebran, a  mystic  and  scientist  who has delved deep into and
       understanding of nature. The book contains over 40 new laws of

       physics, Keely's molecule  in  diagram  form  as  he  saw it with his
       vibratory microscope, plus many other insights into the activities of
       life. The 40 laws supposedly represent  Keely's  system laid out in a
       succinct codified exposition.  Many  of the laws mentioned  were  not
       known at the time of the book's publication; however, they have since
       been discovered by our modern science.

            Dashed Against  the  Rock  was and still is a tribute to a great
       man who may have achieved a greater  understanding  of nature and her
       laws than any man. It is now up to us to re-discover  Keely's  system
       of vibratory physics  to  bring  peace  and free energy to a world in
       great need.
