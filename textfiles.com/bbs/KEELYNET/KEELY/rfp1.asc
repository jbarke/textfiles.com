                           Who was John W. Keely?

        John Keely was an independent researcher specializing in the
             properties of sound during the mid to late 1800's.

                          What did Keely discover?

     He was purported to have discovered techniques based on incredibly
              sensitive vibratory mechanisms which would allow
                the use of the Aether for practical purposes.

                         What devices did he build?

              1) a machine to split the water molecule for the
                 instantaneous release of tremendous pressures

              2) an engine which was reportedly driven by the
                 flow of Aether into its components

              3) designed and built a mineral disintegrator

              4) an acoustic microscope capable of viewing into
                 the molecular and atomic interstices of matter

              5) a globe which could be made to rotate with no
                 outside source of power as a demonstration
                 of the Aetheric flows into matter

              6) a belt device which enabled the operator to
                 induce levitation or gravity in a test mass

                         What happened to his work?

      On his  death  in  1898 of pneumonia, a Boston businessman purchased
      the bulk of equipment.

      On moving it to Boston, the man never successfully operated it which
      caused him to denounce Keely as a fraud.

      Many of Keelys papers were given  to  a  Count Von Rosen of Scotland
      these papers  were  taken  to  Stockholm  in  1912   and  have  been
      unaccounted for since.

      Scientific American  dismantled  the  walls and floor of Keely's lab
      and found a large tank in the basement.

      Leading from the tank into the walls were a multitude of tubes which
      led them to proclaim fraud on the  basis that Keely "must have used"
      compressed air to power his equipment.

                           Who continues the work?

            At the present time and to the best of our knowledge,
                    there are only two groups in the USA
                               which actively
                    research, correlate and investigate
                         the work of John W. Keely

 Introduction

 The papers in this manuscript are a result of many years of study based
 primarily on a   book  written  about  Keely  by  Clara  Bloomfield-Moore
 entitled :

                            "Keelys Discoveries"

 The book is available from Health Research, PO BOX 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA
 95245 for about $17.00.

 Please ask for their current catalog, you will find thousands of reprints
 of rare and difficult to find books, we heartily support them.

 A word about this book, it is written  during  a  time  when verbosity in
 writing was the norm, therefore, be prepared to wade through reams of
 duplication and re-phrasing of the same general concepts.  My own edition
 has become greatly annotated during the 19 years I have been studying it.

 Delta Spectrum Research and Dale Pond have done much to reprint some of
 the more difficult to find books referred to in "Keelys Discoveries" and
 his prices are reasonable.

 My personal recommendations  are the two available volumes  of  MacVicar,
 the Hughes documents and the Snell Manuscript.  A subscription to the

                 "Journal of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics"

 might also be of value to keep informed of what is going on and who the
 movers and shakers are in the field.  Quite reasonable at about $24 per
 year.  Write Dale at the Delta Spectrum address above.

 Vangard Sciences is  a group based in Dallas which studies scientifically
 oriented subjects usually classed as  paranormal  or metaphysical.  Their
 primary purpose is information exchange and research where possible.

 Vangard is actively working to set-up a workshop capable  of  duplicating
 some of the Keely phenomena using state-of-the-art equipment.  We believe
 that this research  must  be  duplicated  and  freely distributed for the
 survival and advancement of mankind.

                     Chapter I - The Basic Keely Primer


      John W. Keely lived and worked in the mid to late 1800's.  His
 principal research and discoveries were accomplished in Philadelphia
 beginning in 1872 with the invention of the Hydro-Pneumatic-Pulsating-
 Vacuo Engine.  This engine was his attempt to use a steam engine coupled
 with a vacuum  to  rapidly  cool  and  condense the steam for re-use as a
 motive force.

      The engine exploded shortly after  beginning  operation.   Since the
 concept of the Aether was in vogue at the time, Keely  thought  he  might
 have successfully dissociated  the  hydrogen  and oxygen components which
 comprise the water molecule.

      Based on this assumption, Keely managed to duplicate the effect and
 continued to design improved versions of the engine.  In his subsequent
 researches, he observed unusual effects relating to the reaction of
 complex sound waves on matter.  These led him deeper into experimentation
 based on the theories advanced by Dr. Angus MacVicar in his work, "A
 Sketch of a Philosophy", (available from Dale Pond at Delta Spectrum).

      Eventually, Keely succeeded in  releasing  up  to  30,000 pounds per
 square inch from  four  drops of water.  He was in full  control  of  the
 process and used it in many experiments.  Keely found that the emissions
 from dissociGted waer took on different characteristics depending on
 the order of  vibration  he  used.   The  disruption of any mass could be
 acheived on any  of  six  possible levels  of  aggregation.   These  were
 labelled :

        Keely Terms                           Modern Terms

       Molecular                             Molecular
       Inter-Molecular                       None
       Atomic                                Atomic
       Inter-Atomic                          Quark
       Etheric                               Prion
       Inter-Etheric                         None

 The terms indicated the various aggregate levels of which matter is
 composed.  These were determined by Keely with the use of his Acoustic
 Microscope which allowed  him  to  directly  view  the structure  of  the
 various components.  As  we  understand  it  from  Dan  A.  Davidson, the
 Acoustic Microscope projected the actual  moving  structure on a wall for
 detailed study.

      One of the most astounding of his discoveries was the concept of the
 Neutral Centre.  The Neutral Centre was at the heart of each structure in
 Nature ranging from the prion to the quark to the atom to the molecule to
 the mass aggregation.

      Individually, the Neutral Centre acts as a drain  for  the Aether to
 pass presumably into  the  4th  dimension.   When they gather or cluster,
 they each have a separate drain with another Master Neutral Centre formed
 from the combination of all the mass  components.  This is what is termed
 the "Center of Mass" in modern physics.


                                   Page 4

      The velocity  of  the  Aetheric  flow  is  determined by the mode of
 operation by which the mass is currently  ruled.   The Neutral Centre can
 be thought of as an adjustable diaphragm which can control  the amount of
 Aether which flows into the "drain" of the Neutral Centre.

      The mode of operation can take any of three possible forms.  Keely
 had broken these down into the Harmonic, the Enharmonic and the Dominant.
 In an attempt  to  make  these easier to deal with, the terms used by the
 RFP theory are more expressive of the attributes of each mode.

      For clarity, this paper will use the terminology incorporated in the
 RFP theory.  Mode and force vector will be used interchangeably.

              RFP term                             Keely term

              Pressor                              Enharmonic
              Tractor                              Harmonic
              Dominant                             Dominant
              Force Vector                         Mode

      The Pressor force vector (mode) accelerates and extends the range of
 molecular oscillation.  When excited or brought into play, it causes
 molecular dissociation with a subsequent decrease in weight.  The Pressor
 mode repels or pushes and is of the nature of centrifugal force in modern
 parlance.

      The Tractor force vector reduces the range of molecular oscillation
 and will cause a general concentration of the mass components.  This
 compaction of the particles of a mass will increase what is perceived as
 weight.  The Tractor   mode  concentrates,   pulls,   attracts   and   is
 exemplified by the centripetal force in modern science.

      The Dominant force vector can either stabilize a mass to prevent
 radioactive decay or bring on transmutation of one element to another.
 This mode completely rearranges all three modes (Tractor, Pressor and
 Dominant) in relation  to  each  other.   Transmutation   is   the   most
 recognizable property of this mode.

      A simple table of relationships is included to show the extent of
 these relationships :

      Pressor                   Tractor                  Dominant

    centrifugal                centripetal                still
    South Pole                 North Pole                 Bloch Wall
    CCW spin                   CW spin                    no spin
    proton                     electron                   neutron
    cold                       hot                        temperate
    positive                   negative                   neutral
    expand                     condens                   transmute
    push                       pull                       stabilize

 As you can see, there are numerous verifications in Nature and science
 based on the trinary concept above the binary.  We have found numerous
 correlations which are quite interesting.

        Pressor                  Tractor                Dominant

      These three modes of force must all three be present in any mass or
 mass aggregation.

      The mass  comprises 100% with all 3 being present in any combination
 of 3 separate percentages.  For instance,  if  we assign (P) for Pressor,
 (T) for Tractor  and  (D) for Dominant, you might better  understand  the
 relationship :

  (P=20%) + (T=60%) + (D=20%) = 100%   the general proportions for much of
                                       the physical mass we are aware of
                                       THE TRACTOR RULES since T=60%

  (P=60%) +  (T=20%)  +  (D=20%) = 100%   the general proportions for mass
                                       which is in a radiatory state, such
                                       as a light or heat source
                                       THE PRESSOR RULES since P=60%

  (P=20%) + (T=20%) + (D=60%) = 100%   the  general proportions in effect
                                       when the mass is in the radioactive
                                       or transmutative state
                                       THE DOMINANT RULES since D=60%

        Pressor                  Tractor                Dominant

      As you can see, if we can gain control of the trinary forces, we can
 adjust the relation of any of the vectors to achieve the effect we wish.

      These can include levitation, compression by dissociation  (if  at a
 sufficiently high order   of  vibration,  we  could  generate  aneutronic
 energy), aggregation or  materialization   of  matter,  transmutation  of
 existing matter and suspension of the aging process.

      Since these are the Creative Forces to which Edgar Cayce refers, you
 can easily conceive of countless other applications and possibilities.

      Our 1st International Keely Symposium was held in  Dallas  in August
 of 1987 and  mentioned  in  the  April 1988 OMNI magazine.  The 2nd Keely
 Symposium was held May 1, 1989 in Colorado  Springs.   We  are working on
 the 3rd Keely  Symposium, again to be held in Dallas  in  the  summer  of
 1990.

      One of  our  guest  speakers  at  the  1st  Symposium,  Wim  Leys of
 Amsterdam, spoke on the work of Rudolph  Steiner  and  how  it related to
 Keely.  Wim said  that mind-force would one day allow  man  to  interface
 with Nature and machines in a way quite magical to modern day technology.
 Those who would  not work hard to learn the mental skills to use the mind
 force would be treated as throwbacks.

      Keely often referred to mind force as being the sole motive power of
 the Universe.  In his later researches, he states that a body that has
 been "equated" in its force relations will live forever.

               Chapter II - Related Discoveries and Hypotheses


      The source of all power in the Universe is the all pervasive Aether.
 It permeates, creates  and  empowers  all  mass and energy forms.  Aether
 vibrates at a  frequency  far  beyond  anything  our  present  electronic
 equipment has been able to detect.

      The Aether  cascades  as  forcefalls  which become  ever  slower  in
 vibration.  These manifest as a spectrum which can be represented thus :

         Aether
              Magnetism
                   Electricity
                        Cosmic Rays
                             Light
                                  Heat
                                       Sound
                                            Physical Vibration
                                                  Matter

      Although there can be many more divisions, most people are familiar
 with these and can grasp the concept quite readily.

      Just as  Light has a spectrum consisting of different colors ranging
 from red to violet, so does each and  every  other  division.  This means
 that Magnetism can   have   many  different  "frequencies",   from   "red
 magnetism" to "blue magnetism".  This also applies to all other divisions
 in the Aether Spectrum.

      At this  time,  we  do  not  have  equipment  to  differentiate  the
 frequencies of the higher energies beyond the low Cosmic Rays.  It is our
 belief that each frequency or combination of frequencies has specific
 effects when applied to matter or energy forms, just as light or sound
 create quite different effects.

      Music is indeed the key to the Universe, as suspected and proven by
 Keely and others.  The Octave Progression links all frequencies in both
 Octave and Harmonic relationships.  This occurs in both the up and down
 directions of the  Aether  Spectrum,   thus,   sound   can  affect  other
 frequencies over the entire spectrum even up into the Aether.

      In the last chapter, a reference was made to Rudolph Steiner and the
 use of Mind-Force.  From the above concept, it is possible  to derive the
 method whereby a  conscious  use of the mind would involve the sensing of
 the Aetheric flow into the Neutral Centre's of the body.

      A serious student would be able  to  sense,  "touch" and channel the
 flow towards the accomplishment of an intended purpose.   This  would  be
 done by the mental dividing or slowing down of the raw Aether as it flows
 into the Neutral  Centres of the body, into any of the cascaded frequency
 bands.  The process could directly transmute  (divide) Aether and halt it
 at the desired  band,  then  divide  down  to  the frequency  desired  to
 accomplish the task.


                                   Page 7

      This relatively  simple  process  is  one  of the primary techniques
 learned and used by those who study  and  master  the "magical arts".  It
 appears to require years of intense concentration and  focussed  thought.
 We believe that  a  bio-feedback mechanism can be developed to assist the
 student into "learning" the ability.

      Due to the extreme delicacy of the vibrations Keely was generating,
 he was required to take great pains to suppress any outside interference
 in the way of sounds or other uncontrolled vibrations.  This extended to
 the use of the transmittng wirü which he üsed in his later experiments.

      The wire  Keely  used  for his experiments  was  composed  of  three
 different elements; silver, gold and platinum.  Keely  said  they had the
 perfect relationship in that they possessed respective ratios of 3:6:9 or
 3 parts to  6  parts  to  9 parts.  This indicated the range of frequency
 multiplication which occurred when a mass was subjected to certain orders
 of vibration.

      The wires and everything else which acted as a carrier for this
 peculiar energy, required a special manufacturing process which Keely
 designed.  Keely called this manufacturing process, "Differentiation".


      Differentiation involved the tempering  (heating and cooling) of the
 metal over periods  of  up  to  3 days for the process  of  removing  any
 imperfections in the   crystalline   structures.    These   very   slight
 imperfections could result in phase or  frequency distortions which would
 alter the vibrational order being experimented with.

      In order to understand the concept of "differentiation", we ask that
 you think of a moving stream of water which flows in a straight line with
 no eddy currents or whirlpools. If a stick were thrown in or stuck in the
 path, the water would deviate around it to cause a distortion in the flow
 of the fluid.

      There is  most  interesting  book,  again  available   from   Health
 Research, called "The  Dividing  of  the Way" by Phylos the Tibetan.  The
 book refers to  "cascaded  forcefalls".    These   cascades  involve  the
 "division" or slowing  down of the flow of force to yield  another  lower
 form of force.

      This slowing down is very similar to the impedance to the water flow
 by the stick.   These "knotholes" in the structure of the wires and other
 components had to be "ironed out" to achieve near perfect transmission of
 the Aetheric forces  that were brought  on  "artificially"  with  Keely's
 Vibration machines.  This  concept  of  the  cascaded  forcefall  applies
 directly to frequencies  and  shows  how  very  high  frequencies  can be
 "slowed down" or divided to generate lower frequences.

      This slowing  down  is done when  the  "knotholes"  in  a  mass  are
 encountered by energy  moving in a wave train at a high  frequency.   The
 resistance/impedance of the  whirlpools to the flow of the energy at this
 high frequency directly impedes the flow  to cause an increase the length
 of the wave.  The wavelength is the number of wave crests  which  pass  a
 point within a   given  interval,  usually  per  second.   Thus,  as  the
 whirlpools collide with  each  other,  the  wavelenght  is  resisted  and
 therefore slowed.

      Mentioned in the first chapter was the original device, called the
 Hydro-Pneumatic-Pulsating-Vacuo Engine.  The explosion of this device
 set Keely on the arduous trek which often proved frustrating.  As Keely
 experimented with unknown forces, the inevitable accidents did occur.  On
 several occasions, devices   or  experiments  on  which  he  was  working
 produced energies far  beyond his expectations.   The  results  sometimes
 caused structural damage  to his workshop and on at least  two  occasions
 that we know  of,  direct  injury to himself.  One of these times, he was
 laid up for six weeks due to a violent explosion.

      Keely mentions that pipes several inches in diameter blew up as if
 made of straw.  Steel shafts having  diameters  of  several  inches which
 were attached to Aether driven motors would instantly warp when the motor
 suffered a reversal in direction.  Carbon steel resonators would turn to
 putty when certain vibrations were attained.

      As you can see, the experiments were fraught with unpredictable
 results in some cases.  Keely persevered in his researches,  ever  driven
 by observations of  new  phenomena.   In the process, Keely was analyzing
 and measuring the frequencies and conditions  under  which each new event
 took place using analytical and test equipment of his  own  design.  From
 these, it is  reported  that  many fine drawings and charts were drawn to
 illustrate the processes  and  laws  governing  his  investigations  into
 Sympathetic Vibratory Physics.

      The practical dissociation of the water molecule on either one or
 more levels of  aggregation  would  yield  anything  from   a  taffy-like
 substance to an  electrical  type  force.   Each  of  these  products had
 different properties and  released   progressively  more  energy  as  the
 aggregate level size decreased.

      Keely states in the Bloomfield-Moore that the water  molecule  could
 be dissociated on  620,  630  or  12000 cycles per second.  Interestingly
 enough, our friend Dr. Andrija Puharich developed a device for de-gassing
 blood which he later adapted to the  hydrolizying  of water.  This device
 is patented and  runs on 600 cycles per second, amazingly  close  to  the
 number Keely gives.

      The Aetheric Motor was designed to tap the flow of aetheric force
 which flows to the Neutral Centre of all mass.  Keely designed a special
 motor to take advantage of this flow.  As far as we can tell, it seems to
 have used a "rotating sonic field" to drive the shaft.  This is directly
 analogous to the work of Nikola Tesla and his discovery of the "rotating
 magnetic field".

      We have wondered if Keely and Tesla ever met.  Tesla worked with
 brute force technologies when compared with the sensitized equipment of
 Keely.  That is a major reason why none of Keelys instruments would work
 unless he was present.  The orders of vibration required to produce the
 effects Keely generated   were   so   delicate   (due  to  the  exquisite
 construction and limited amplitudes of the devices) that the least
 distortion would cancel the effect.



                                   Page 9

      Tesla designed and used electrical devices which could be used by
 anyone, whereas Keely's  devices  had  to be fully understood and handled
 with the greatest care.

      Today, things are radically different  with  the level of technology
 we have, the duplication of the Keely phenomena is held  back only by two
 factors, money and  time.   Another  intention  of  this manuscript is to
 illuminate the field so that others  can  contribute and possibly help to
 re-discover the principles that died with Keely.

      The construction  of  the  Aetheric  Motor  involved   the   use  of
 "vitalized disks" which  were  mounted  on  arms  attached to a rotatable
 shaft.  When the correct order of vibration  was achieved, the "vitalized
 disks" would be  repelled from each other in a manner which  would  cause
 the shaft to  rotate.  Reports indicate that the shaft could rotate up to
 110 RPM and with an incredible torque.  This device went through hundreds
 of modifications and rebuilds in an attempt to correct what Keely termed
 "reversions".  A reversion occurs when  a  motor  running properly and in
 the correct direction  suddenly  reverses  its' direction.   This  causes
 havoc with the motor shaft and any attached devices.

      Keely never overcame this problem to a point which would allow its
 release to the  public  until  the  late 1800's.  By that time, Keely had
 discovered a far superior method of  generating  and applying force.  The
 stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, who had invested in the original
 Keely Motor Company, took legal action against Keely to  recover  some of
 their losses.  When the judge ordered Keely to bring his devices to court
 for the purpose  of  revealing  his  secrets,  Keely ¼smashed them with a
 sledge hammer in an eccentric fit.

      Some of Keely's experiments are still with us in annotated versions.
 One of which  is  the Mineral Disintegrator.  The  principle  behind  the
 Mineral Disintegrator was accidentally discovered while  carrying  out  a
 series of experiments with what Keely termed the Vibratory Lift.  A large
 block of quartz  was  being used as a weight and connected with the Lift.
 When a specific  order  of  vibration  was  achieved,  the  quartz  block
 suffered partial disintegration.  Keely managed to duplicate  the  effect
 and built a  machine  specifically for that purpose.  This was one of the
 devices destroyed in his fit of pique.

      In his work with acoustics, Keely found it necessary to design his
 own analytical equipment.  This also meant the construction of platforms
 and tables capable of suppressing extraneous vibrations which could upset
 his experiments.  Eventually, to gain  a  more  detailed understanding of
 the true structure of molecular and atomic interstices, Keely built a
 microscope.  This was no ordinary microscope however, it consisted of a
 lens with a built-in silver, gold and platinum wire.  When properly
 excited, it yielded direct optical viewing into the heart  of  matter  by
 projecting the image  onto  a  wall  for  detailed  study  of  the moving
 particles.

      A normal microscope ranges anywhere from 200 to 2000 times.  The
 famous Rife optical microscope could magnify up to 17,000 times.  Modern
 electron microscopes, which do not use optical viewing, can magnify up to
 350,000 times while a field ion microscope can magnify up to 5 million
 times.  As you can see, Keely was and is far ahead of our most advanced
 technology.  This is another device destroyed during the litigation.

      In the latter part of his researches, from about 1880 to his death,
 Keely devoted most of his time to the perfecting of his Aerial Navigation
 System.  This was  based  on  an accidental discovery which brought about
 the levitation of a test mass.  Again, Keely successfully analyzed and
 duplicated the feat.

      The original version of the book "Keelys Experiments" has a subtitle
 of "Aerial Navigation".  It is most  curious  that  the  mysterious Keely
 Airship is not  shown  nor  described  in  this  book.   Due  to  a  very
 knowledgable and sharing  man,  Mr.  Victor  Hansen,  we  were allowed to
 photocopy a drawing of the airship and the description of its operation.

      It appears that sometime after  the  publication  of the Bloomfield-
 Moore book, many copies were removed from the market and edited.  We know
 for a certaintly  that  the  section  with  the Aiship  picture  and  its
 description were removed.  We do not at present know if other information
 was removed.  It  seems  that  some  person or group has deemed the Keely
 work dangerous to  mankind  or has some  nefarious  purpose  behind  this
 action.

      One of the Keely's initial levitation experiments  involved  a glass
 jar of water  in which a metal weight was placed.  Fastened to the top of
 the jar was a metal plate which had attached to it, a silver and platinum
 wire leading to the source of vibration.

      After Keely tuned the vibrator to the test weight at the bottom of
 the tank of water, it was caused to vibrate.  The weight floated from the
 bottom of the tank to the bottom of the plate attached to the jar.  This
 was definitely NOT Archimedes' (pressure buoyancy) Principle.

      Another similar experiment involved the use of 3 different sizes of
 spheres.  The vibrator was tuned to a single sphere.  When the vibrations
 ensued, the only sphere which rose in  the water was the one to which the
 resonator had been tuned.  Keely could demonstrate this  principle on any
 of the 3  different  sized  spheres.  Witnesses report that he could make
 any sphere rise halfway and stop, go  completely  to  the top or descend,
 all under his control.

      The famous psychic, Edgar Cayce gave many readings  which dealt with
 vibration and the use of the Creative Forces.  In one such reading, Edgar
 Cayce says,

               "Stone floats in air as iron floats in water."

      This is  a direct reference to the prophet Elisha and his causing an
 iron axehead to rise from the bottom of the river Jordan to the surface.

      If you have ever watched, "In  Search  Of:",  you  might  recall the
 story of Edward  Leedskalnin  of Coral Castle in Homestead,  Florida.   I
 flew there to  see  the  structure  and  it  is  most  interesting.   Mr.
 Leedskalnin claimed he had discovered  the  secret  of  the Egyptians and
 their pyramid building.  People claimed Ed sang to the  stones  to  cause
 them to move, though no one claims to have actually seen him do this.

      We have done quite a study on both organic and inorganic levitation.
 This information will be available in the complete edition of this work
 which should be available in November of this year.  It will include many
 other histories and  correlative  studies.  The order form is in the rear
 of this book.

      Another of Keelys levitation experiments involved the use of a model
 airship.  He reportedly caused the airship  to  ascend,  hover or descend
 "as light as  thistledown" when attached to a silver  and  platinum  wire
 which was connected to a properly tuned vibrator.

      By far,  the  most  exhilarating  account  is of the levitation of a
 steam engine weighing about one ton.   Keely  attached  a belt around his
 waist which had a silver and platinum wire leading from  it.   He wrapped
 the wire around   the   engine,  stepped  back  and  struck  the  pre-set
 vibrators.  The engine floated in the  air  while  Keely  moved it to the
 desired location.  There were reportedly more than 20 witnesses.

      Later, an engineer was consulted about the best means of moving the
 steam engine.  His response was to remove the roof of the building so a
 derrick could be used to hoist the engine to the proper location.  He did
 not believe that the engine had been easily moved earlier.

      Another account involves the mysterious three ton sphere, fully four
 feet in diameter, which Scientific American discovered under the floor of
 Keely's lab after  his death.  The sphere weighed in  the  neiborhood  of
 6500 pounds and  was estimated to have a bursting strength of 28,000 psi.
 The assertions were that he used compressed  air  which would "obviously"
 be stored in this container.  (source - Dan A. Davidson)

      What the  Scientific  American people did not look  into,  were  the
 numerous newspaper and  magazines articles written about Keely during his
 lifetime.  One such article refers to  a  visit  by a reporter to Keely's
 lab.  In the article, the reporter says that he found  Keely  removing  a
 section of flooring  to  make a large hole.  As the reporter watched, Mr.
 Keely placed a strange belt with numerous  attached mechanisms around his
 waist.  Keely then attached a thin wire from the belt to the sphere which
 rested in the corner of the laboratory.

      Mr. Keely  then proceeded to concentrate while staring  intently  at
 the sphere.  Moments  later  and  the  iron  sphere  rose  in the air and
 "floated" while under the gaze of Keely.  As Keely shifted his stare, the
 sphere floated over to and above the  hole  in  the  lab floor.  As Keely
 relaxed his concentration,  the sphere settled to the  ground  below  the
 floor level.  Keely  then  made  slight adjustments to the belt mechanism
 and once again stared intently at the resting sphere.  Again, the intense
 concentration directed h s will toward  the  sphere.   The  sphere slowly
 sank into to ground as its weight was magnified through  the concentrated
 and directed will of Keely.

      The reporter was told by Keely that he simply was making room in the
 lab by clearing away some outmoded equipment.  The true use of the sphere
 was as s  reservoir for the etheric vapor which Keely's early experiments
 released from the dissociation of the water molecule.  As his experiments
 continually led him to more sophisticated  controls,  he  found  that the
 Aether could be conducted through the differentiated wires  as  mentioned
 earlier in this paper.

             Chapter IV - Applications of the Keely Technologies

      As you  can  determine  from this paper, the applications for any of
 these three modes  of force as discovered  and  practically  applied  are
 mind-boggling.

      Some of the obvious that come to mind are listed  as  a  closing for
 this version of  the manuscript.  Remember that this work was done in the
 1800's by a lone inventor.

      Are we so greedy and self-centered  that  we  will not do everything
 within our power  to  bring  these  secrets  back  from   oblivion?   The
 GREENHOUSE EFFECT is killing us and our planet on a yearly basis.

      The re-discovery of the Keely secrets would launch us into space and
 provide us with  the secrets of free energy as well as a means of gravity
 concentration and negation. Not to mention the final solution of who owns
 the UFOs.

      We will not go into the medical or transmutative aspects as they are
 much too involved and beyond the scope of this version of the RFP theory.

      The Pressor force vector can be used to control the "weight of a
 mass" to enjoy total levitation or a reduction in the perceived weight.
 Imagine what it will do for transportation, commerce and traffic jams.

      The Tractor force vector can be used as a beam for the attraction or
 holding of another mass.  Finally, the non-ferrous magnet that will work
 even on organic tissues!  How about controlled mass aggregations?  In
 simpler terms, you could say materialization.

      The Dominant force vector can be used to stabilize a mass to prevent
 dissolution through natural  radioactive   decay.    It   also   is   the
 transmutative vector, what could that be used for?
