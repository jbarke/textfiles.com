       ABSTRACT

       The hypothesis for tapping the zero-point  energy  (ZPE)  arises  by
       combining the theories of the ZPE with the theories  of system self-
       organization.  The vacuum  polarization of atomic nuclei might allow
       their synchronous motion to activate a ZPE coherence.

       Experimentally observed plasma ion-acoustic  anomalies  as  well  as
       inventions utilizing cycloid   ion  motions  may  offer   supporting
       evidence.  The suggested experiment of rapidly circulating a charged
       plasma in a  vortex ring might induce a sufficient zero-point energy
       interaction to manifest  a  gravitational   anomaly.   An  invention
       utilizing abrupt E field rotation to create virtual  charge exhibits
       excessive energy output.

       INTRODUCTION

       Today's physics might  allow  the  possibility  of tapping virtually
       limitless quantities of energy directly from the fabric of space.


                                      Page 1

       Such a surprising   conjecture   arises   by  merging  two  separate
       theoretical areas of modern physics:

           1)  The theories of the zero-point energy (1-5) (ZPE) that model
               the vacuum as containing  real,  energetic  fluctuations  of
               electric field energy, and
           2)  the theories of system self-organization  (6-13)  which  not
               only open  the  possibility  of  inducing  coherence in this
               energy, but also provide  the  underlying  principles on how
               this could be achieved (10).

       At first this hpyothesis might seem to be a blatant violation of the
       conservation of energy.  But the key question is:

                     Does the zero-point energy REALLY exist?

       If so, a  real energy is already present and its conservation  would
       not be an issue.

       The real issue  centers  on  how  random  fluctuations  could become
       coherent.  Any spontaneous coherence seems to violate the second law
       of thermodynamics, which is generally  understood  to  mean  systems
       should evolve toward random behavior, not toward coherence.

       This point is thoroughly discussed in the theories  of  system self-
       organization (11,12).  Prigogine  (13)  won  the 1977 Nobel prize in
       chemistry for defining the conditions  under  which  a  system could
       evolve from randomness  toward coherence.  The conditions  are  that
       the system must be

            1)  far from equilibrium,
            2)  nonlinear in its dynamics and
            3)  have an energy flux through it.

       These conditions are  expressed  in general system theory terms, and
       it turns out that the already published  theories  of  the  ZPE can,
       under certain circumstances, fulfill these conditions.

       Despite the intriguing  possibility  offered  by system  theory,  no
       purely theoretical discussion  could  ever prove that the zero-point
       energy could be  tapped as an energy  source.   Only  an  experiment
       coupled with the theory would be convincing.

       This article discusses  how observed anomalies associated  with  the
       ion-acoustic oscillations in  plasmas  could be a manifestation of a
       coherent ZPE interaction and in particular,  how  the cycloid motion
       of a a plasma's nuclei might induce a sufficient  ZPE  coherence  to
       manifest a gravitational anomaly.

       This article also  highlights an invention which utilizes the abrupt
       rotation of electric fields to cause an hypothesized pair production
       of virtual charges  from  the vacuum  energy  across  a  macroscopic
       system.  The invention reportedly outputs excessive power while free
       running.  The invention  reportedly  outputs excessive  power  while
       free running, and  its  full disclosure may constitute an experiment
       which could be repeated by the scientific community.

       THE FABRIC OF SPACE

       Does the fabric of empty space really contain a plenum of energy?
       This question has been debated throughout the history of science.

       The early scientists  through  the  19th  century  believed  in  the
       existence of an ether, which was  modeled  as  a  material substance
       that could support the wave propagation of light.

       The famous Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the expected
       ether wind produced by the earth's motion through it.   At  the turn
       of the cnetury  Einstein  used  this result to support the theory of
       special relativity.  When  this  became   accepted,  the  scientific
       community rejected the  existence  of  the  ether.   Thus  classical
       physicists came to consider the vacuum of space to be truly empty.

       The classical model  was  only to last until the 1930's when quantum
       mechanics became accepted.    From   quantum   mechanics   arose   a
       mathematical term in  the  description of the ground  state  of  any
       oscillating system called the zero-point energy.

       The term "zero-point" refers to zero degrees Kelvin which means this
       energy exists even  in  the  absence  of  all  heat.  The energy was
       interpreted as being INHERENT TO THE FABRIC OF SPACE ITSELF.

       Dirac (14) showed how electron-positron  pair production could arise
       from the vacuum fluctuations and quantum electrodynamics was born.

       The Heisenberg uncertaintly  principle  allowed  quantum  mechanical
       systems to "borrow"  this  energy  for  short  periods of time.  The
       ether came back into science not modeled as a material substance but
       rather as a randomly fluctuating energy.

       Could a space  filled  with  fluctuations   of   electric   flux  be
       consistent with special  relativity?   Boyer (15)  showed  that,  by
       invoking the postulate  of  Lorentz  invariance, the spectral energy
       density p of the zero-point fluctuations  must  have  the particular
       form as a function of frequency w  :

                                              3
                                     p(w) = kw

       where the constant k is related to Planck's constant.   This  result
       gives a quantitative  basis  to the theory of random electrodynamics
       which strives to show that quantum  mechanical  effects  arise  FROM
       MATTER'S INTERACTION WITH THE ZERO-POINT ENERGY.

       This cubic frequency relation implies an absurd result:

                           the energy density of the ZPE
                        AT EACH POINT IN SPACE is INFINITE!

       A similar problem  plagues quantum electrodynamics where  infinities
       are renormalized away.  Some type of frequency cutoff is required to
       create a finite, quantitative theory.

       Wheeler (16) applied  the theory of general relativity to the ZPE to
       create a natural  cutoff  in  his theory  of  geometrodynamics.   In
       general relativity the fabric of space curves as a function of

                                      Page 3

       energy density.

       When the density becomes sufficiently great, space pinches like it's
       forming a black   hole.    This  gives  rise  to  the  formation  of
       hyperspace structures that Wheeler called "wormholes."

       His calculation yielded microscopic  channels  on the order of 10-33
       (to the -33rd) cm having a (mass equivalent) energy density of 10+94
       (to the 94th) grams/cm3 (cubed).

       The resulting view  is  that  the  fabric  of  space   consists   of
       constantly forming and  annihilating  pairs  of  microscopic  "mini"
       blackholes and whiteholes which channel  electric  flux into and out
       of our three dimensional space.

       These mini holes  manifest  dynamics  which could be  modeled  as  a
       turbulent, virtual plasma that Wheeler calls the "quantum foam."  In
       this view the  elementary  particles  are  like  bubbles or vortices
       arising from the dynamics of the vacuum energy.

       Is it possible to tap this energy?   At first the answer seems to be
       no since it  is extermely difficult experimentally  to  observe  its
       existence; the energy  is  ubiquitous  and  a  detector  REQUIRES AN
       ENERGY DIFFERENCE to measure field strength.

       However, the theories of quantum electrodynamics  indicate  that all
       the elementary particles are dynamically interacting  with  the  ZPE
       resulting in vacuum    polarization.     In    particular,   quantum
       electrodynamics shows that  the   different   elementary   particles
       polarize the vacuum differently (17-19).

       In a first  order  model,  electrons,  especially   conduction  band
       electrons, exhibit an  ethereal  cloud-like  random interaction with
       the zero-point fluctuations  and are  effectively  in  thermodynamic
       equilibrium with it.  No net energy would be absorbed  by  this type
       of system.

       However, an atomic nucleus exhibits a pattern of quasi-stable vacuum
       polarization channels converging  toward  it.   This  may  allow the
       possibility of driving the nucleus-ZPE  system off of equilibrium by
       abrupt motion.  This fulfills the first condition for  system  self-
       organization.

       How the other   conditions   could  be  fulfilled  as  well  can  be
       understood by modeling the ZPE as  a virtual plasma.  Like a plasma,
       it is nonlinear in its dynamical behavior, it may be  driven  off of
       equilibrium by the  abrupt  motion  of  nuclei, and it might well be
       sustained by an energy flux intersecting our three dimensional space
       from a higher dimensional superspace (20-22).

       This last point is clearly the most speculative.  If true, it offers
       VIRTUALLY LIMITLESS ENERGY.

       It can best be supported by noting that there are interpretations of
       quantum mechanics and relativity theory which imply the existence of
       a physically real,  higher dimensional  space,  and  the  notion  of
       superspace is well discussed in the physics literature (23-25).

       It is interesting to note that some authors (26,27) recognized that

                                      Page 4

       the mathematical analysis of a nonlinear system interacting with the
       ZPE shows that energy could be extracted, but they are skeptical due
       to the lack of experimental evidence.

       ION-ACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS

       The real proof  that  the  zero-point  energy could become an energy
       source can only  come  from  a  repeatable  experiment.   The  above
       discussion suggests that the motion of a plasma's nuclei might be an
       effective transducer for interacting with the ZPE.

       The coherent oscillations of nuclei in a plasma is known as the ion-
       acoustic mode, and  it  has  been  associated with anomalous  plasma
       behavior including run-away  electrons  (28), anomalous heating (29-
       31), anomalous resistance (32), and  high  frequency  voltage spikes
       (33-35).

       Could these anomalies  be associated with a direct  ZPE  interaction
       manifesting a macroscopic vacuum polarization (36)?

       The inventor T.   Henry  Moray  (37)  stressed the importance of ion
       oscillations in the plasma tubes of  his  invention that produced 50
       kilowatts of anomalous  electrical power in the 1930's.   His  well-
       witnessed invention could  not be explained with the physics of that
       time, and puzzled all the scientists who investigated his device.

       Another experiment where coherent  oscillations  of  nuclei could be
       the source of  anomalous  heat  is  the electrolytic  "cold  fusion"
       experiment of Pons and Fleischmann (38).

       In this experiment  deuterium  nuclei occupy shallow potential wells
       in the crystal lattice sites of the  palladium.  Here the nuclei are
       free to oscillate  (39),  but  they generally diffuse  to  adjacent,
       vacant lattice sites (40).

       However, under the  conditions  of deuterium supersaturation all the
       lattice sites are occupied, and the deuterons within a crystal grain
       of palladium could then undergo synchronous  oscillations similar to
       ion-acoustic heat (41).  This hypothesis predicts the  effect  would
       be greatly enhanced  by  supersaturating  a  pure  single crystal of
       palladium and that   an   electrical   pulse   could   trigger   the
       oscillation.

       It might also   be   possible  to  generate  anomalous   heat   with
       experiments using ordinary  water  (although it is more difficult to
       constrain protons to  the  lattice   sites   than  deuterons).   The
       difficulty in  repeating  the  heat  anomaly of the Pons/Fleischmann
       experiment is probably  the  first repeatable experiment in which at
       least some other scientists are able  to  produce  an energy anomaly
       (42).

       PLASMA SPIRALS

       Other investigators have  claimed energy anomalies  associated  with
       plasma behavior.  The  Russian  plasma  physicist, Chernetskii, from
       his observations of  anomalous energetic  plasma  activity  explains
       that under appropriate conditions a plasma interacts  directly  with
       the ZPE (43).


                                      Page 5

       He has recently claimed to have created a plasma device that absorbs
       energy from the  vacuum  fluctuations  when  the  plasma's particles
       undergo cycloid motion (43).

       Likewise the inventions of Searle  (44),  Spence (45), and Papp (46)
       also have cycloid particle motion in the plasmas within their energy
       producing devices.

       Ball lighting (47)  is  a possible candidate for a  ZPE  interaction
       since it has  been  modeled  as  a  vortex  ring plasmoid (48).  The
       energy source needed to maintain its  persistence  must be localized
       within the ball  since  it  has  been  observed inside  of  shielded
       environments such as aircraft and submarines.

       In a submarine  a particular type of circuit breaker has launched it
       on multiple occasions  (49).   The   vortex   ring  model  for  ball
       lightning has its  plasma particles undergoing precessional  cycloid
       motion, and it  might therefore be an example of a zero-point energy
       coherence occurring in nature.

       It may also  be possible to induce  the  cycloid  motion  of  nuclei
       within solid state  magnetic  materials  such as ferrites.   When  a
       ferrite's magnetic domain   wall  moves,  the  microscopic  magnetic
       dipoles rotate (50).  This supports  the  propagation  of  nonlinear
       spinor waves through  the ferrite (51).  This wave directly  couples
       to the ferrite  lattice  causing  an elastic, acoustical spinor wave
       (52).  This results in the helical motion of the ferrite's nuclei.

       If such motion induces a zero-point  energy  coherence,  then nearby
       pickup coils might detect anomalous energy.  Such a  hypothesis  may
       help explain the  "free  energy"  inventions of Coler (53) and Sweet
       (54).

       The plasma vortex-ZPE hypothesis could  also be applied to the water
       vortex studies of Schauberger (55).  He claimed that water forced to
       precess through specially shaped spiralling tubes induced  an energy
       anomaly causing a  peculiar  bluish  glow to appear at the center of
       the vortex.

       Also the gyroscope studies by Laithwaite  (56)  may  fit  the vortex
       hypothesis.  Laithwaite observed  that a precessing  gyroscope  that
       was displaced along  a  particular  cycloid  path  would  exhibit an
       inertial/gravitational anomaly.

       GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALIES

       The expectation of gravitational anomalies associated with coherence
       of the zero-point energy arises directly from general relativity.

       Gravity is described as curvature  of  the space-time metric induced
       by the stress-energy tensor (57).  If the zero-point  energy has the
       enormous density as   predicted  by  Wheeler,  then  even  a  slight
       coherence in its activity could curve  the  local  space-time metric
       producing measurable gravitational or time anomalies.

       An experiment which  altered  the  pace of time near  the  apparatus
       would suggest the ZPE's involvement (58).  Puthoff (59) has recently
       quantitatively explored Sakarov's   suggestion   that   gravity   is
       intimately coupled to the behavior of the ZPE by proposing a model

                                      Page 6

       in which gravity  directly  arises from the action of the zero-point
       fluctuations.

       An experiment which produced a gravitational  or  time anomaly would
       yield evidence that the ZPE is being cohered because  the ZPE is the
       only energy appreciable   enough   to  induce  a  space-time  metric
       curvature by technological means.

       How could such an anomaly be demonstrated experimentally?  The ideas
       presented in this   paper   suggest    the   following   preliminary
       experiment:

         A piping  system  is  shaped into a vortex ring (Figure  1)  whose
         poloidal/toroidal size  ratio is similar to the plasmoids observed
         by Bostick (60) in his experiments.

         Charged fluid or plasma is pumped to circulate rapidly through the
         vortex ring.   Note  that  the plasma  is  forced  to  undergo  an
         effective precessional motion (a poloidal rotation  closing into a
         toroidal rotation).

         A weight  change  in the apparatus or a change in the pace of time
         nearby the apparatus would support the proposed conjecture that an
         ionic plasma vortex could induce a ZPE coherence.

            (since we cannot duplicate the drawing in this file,
             Figure 1 shows a donut shape viewed from the top and
             generated by loops as if a Slinky toy was connected end to
             end "Vortex ring mainfesting precessional flow")

       An oscillatory ion-acoustic plasma  vortex  ring can be created with
       an electrical circuit.  A toroidal coil is wound on  a  ferrite core
       with wire whose  insulator  is  coated  with  a  mildly  radioactive
       material.

       Alternatively the coil  could be  bombarded  by  ionizing  radiation
       (61).  The radiation only needs to be strong enough  to  ionize  the
       air or gas near the surface of the toroidal coil, and it maintains a
       cold plasma.

       The coil is  then tuned to resonate at the ion-acoustic frequency of
       this plasma by adding an appropriate  capacitance to the circuit.  A
       properly tuned resonance   yields   ion   oscillatory   displacement
       currents in the  medium  surrounding  the  wire which acts as a wave
       guide.

       During resonance further ionization  could  accrue shifting the ion-
       acoustic frequency.  This nonlinear effect can be stabilized  with a
       parallel, variable capacitor   controlled   via   feedback   by  the
       magnitude of the output current.

       The capacitance is automatically  adjusted  to  maximize  the output
       current unless it  becomes too large at which point  the  system  is
       intentionally detuned.  If  the  ion-acoustic  plasma vortex were to
       interact coherently with the ZPE,  then  anomalous energy production
       might occur in such a system.

       MACROSCOPIC PAIR PRODUCTION

       The plasma vortex  ring motif can be applied directly to the virtual
       ZPE plasma to  create  a model of  an  elementary  charge.   Bostick
       showed that a  pair  of plasmoid vortex rings could  arise  from  an
       abruptly excited, turbulent plasma (60).

       In a similar  fashion  could electron-positron pair production arise
       as vortex rings from the ZPE modeled  as  a virtual plasma?  In this
       analogy the charge  would  be associated with the  helicity  of  the
       electric flux circulation on the vortex ring (62,63).

       Likewise the electric  (E) field lines emanating from a charge could
       be modeled as helical filaments (64).   Here  the  helical filaments
       would originate from  the  charge and be sustained  continuously  by
       electric flux flowing  at the speed of light.  This model of E field
       lines offers a dynamic possibility for activating the vacuum energy.

       If an E field line alone could be  abruptly  rotated, it would mimic
       the precessional flow  of  a  vortex  ring section  (Figure  2)  and
       consequently would manifest  for  an  instant  virtual  charge  at a
       macroscopic level.  This would constitute  a  coherence in the zero-
       point energy.

            (Figure 2  shows a 1 quarter section of the doughnut  shape  as
             described in  Figure  1  "Vortex  filament  model  of abruptly
             rotated E field line")

       An experiment in  which E field lines  are  abruptly  rotated  might
       yield excessive energy from the resulting voltage transients.

       Such an experiment  has  already been done, and its  description  is
       essentially the invention  by Hyde (65).  Hyde uses rapidly spinning
       segmented rotors to abruptly cut E field lines, and his invention is
       reported to output power TEN TIMES THE INPUT!

       The invention consists  of a pair  of  excitor  plates,  a  pair  of
       segmented rotors and a pair of segmented stators (Figure 3).  Charge
       is free to migrate on the conductive surfaces comprising  the rotors
       and excitor plates,  but  on  the  stators  the adjacent, conductive
       segments are electrically insulated from each other.

            (Figure 3 consists of 3 parts,  the first shows a simple circle
             labelled EXCITOR PLATE, the second shows a disk segmented into
             3 section similar to the symbol for atomic hazard and labelled
             SEGMENTED ROTOR and the third shows a circle  sectioned into 6
             areas much like a pie chard evenly divided into 6 sections, it
             is labelled  SEGMENTED  STATOR "Simplified version of excitor,
             rotor and stator")

                  Figure 4.  Connection of components (side view)

       An external voltage  source charges the excitor plates which provide
       an electrostatic polarization field.   Insulation  on  the  device's
       negatively charged surfaces insures that no current  leaks  from the
       excitor plates and  little  power is drwan from the charging voltage
       source.

       The rotors are  electrically  connected  to  each  other  through  a
       conductive shaft which is spun by an electric motor (not shown).

       The rotors in the patent description were electrically  connected by
       brushes to their  adjacent  stators, but Hyde has since improved his
       invention by removing  these contacts  (66).   The  field  from  the
       excitor plates induces a polarization between the connected rotors.

       The segments on both rotors are aligned to allow them  to  shield an
       aligned pair of stator segments.  As the rotor spins, aligned stator
       segments are ALTERNATELY  EXPOSED  and  SHEILDED  from  the  excitor
       polarization field.

       Each stator segment is electrically  connected to its counterpart on
       the other stator  through  a PULSE RECTIFIER CIRCUIT  in  which  the
       transient voltage pulses  are  stepped  down and then channeled to a
       combining rectifier output circuit (not shown).

       It is a surprise that such a simple  device  as  Hyde's could output
       anomalous power.  An  analysis  using just classical  physics  would
       predict that the  voltage induced across a stator segment pair would
       swing between zero and the excitor  plate  voltage since this is the
       steady state limit for the shielded and exposed conditions.
       This is observed when the rotor is spun slowly.

       However, when the rotor is spun on the order of 6000  rpm,  a  3  KV
       potential across the  excitor  plates yields stator pulses in excess
       of 300 KV with a very small drag on the rotor (67).

       rotors is illustrated in the top view sequence in Figure 5.

       During the exposed condition, current  flows  to  charge  the stator
       segment pair.  Under rapid spin, the rotor blade  cuts  through  the
       gap quicker than  the charge can leave the stator segment due to the
       current's momentum from  residual   inductance   of  the  connecting
       circuit.

       The charge remains on the stator segment during the  instant  its  E
       field lines are  cut resulting in their abrupt rotation.  If such an
       abrupt rotation of E field lines manifests  virtual  charge from the
       vacuum energy, then this charge would greatly augment  the potential
       across the stator  segment  pairs and yield a more vigourous voltage
       transient.

       Note that opposite virtual charge  is  created simultaneously on the
       outer surfaces of   the   connected   stator   segments.     Quantum
       electrodynamics allows virtual charge pair production from the ZPE

                                      Page 10

       as long as  charge  is conserved.  This analysis of Hyde's invention
       suggests virtual charge pair production in the macroscopic realm.

       The resulting transient zero-point  energy coherence accelerates the
       charges of the  stator  segment  circuit,  and  the  system  outputs
       anomalously excessive energy.

       SUMMARY

       Applying the principles  of system self-organization to the theories
       of the zero-point energy suggests  that  an appropriate system might
       be able to  induce  a  coherence  in  the action of  the  zero-point
       energy.

       Quantum electrodynamics shows that the ZPE intimately interacts with
       the various elementary  particles with differing vacuum polarization
       dynamics.  The vacuum  polarization  description  of  atomic  nuclei
       suggests that abrupt, synchronous motion of ions or  nuclei may be a
       good candidate for coherent vacuum energy activation.

       The observed anomalies associated with the ion-acoustic oscillations
       of a plasma  might  be  evidence  for  this.  Further circumstantial
       evidence may arise from the claims  of  different  investigators and
       inventors whose devices  exhibit  a  common  modus  operandi:   They
       utilize coherent, synchronous motion of ions or nuclei.

       The largest claims  are associated with devices that produce cycloid
       or precessional motion of nuclei.  This leads to the hypothesis that
       a POSITIVELY CHARGED PLASMA VORTEX MIGHT INDUCE A ZPE COHERENCE.

       The idea can be experimentally explored  by  rapidly  circulating  a
       charged plasma or  fluid  through  a vortex ring piping  system  and
       looking for a  gravitational  or  time  variation  since  there is a
       recognized theorectical connection between gravity and the action of
       the zero-point energy.

       Since vortex ring plasmoid pair production  is observed in turbulent
       plasmas, modeling the  ZPE as a turbulent, virtual  plasma  supports
       the vortex ring  model for elementary charge and the vortex filament
       model for electric field lines.

       Such a model predicts that the abrupt  rotation  of  electric  field
       lines would manifest virtual charge from the vacuum energy.

       Experimental support that   macroscopic,   virtual    charge    pair
       production might provide  energy  directly  from the ZPE arises from
       Hyde's fully disclosed invention.  It appears imperative that Hyde's
       invention be replicated, for only a repeating experiment could prove
       that it is  possible  to tap the  zero-point  energy  as  an  energy
       source.
