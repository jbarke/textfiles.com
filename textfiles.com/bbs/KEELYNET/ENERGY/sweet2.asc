       Hello,

       I just received  in  ASCII form the two papers by Mr. Tom E. Bearden
       which appeared in the Proceedings  of  the  26th Intersociety Energy
       Conversion Engineering Conference,   August   4-9,   1991,   Boston,
       Massachusetts.  They can  be  found  in  volume  4  in  the  section
       entitled 'Advanced Energy Concepts'.  The titles are :

             "Utilizing Scalar Electromagnetics to Tap Vacuum Energy"
                  by Floyd Sweet and Tom E. Bearden (pp. 370-375)
                        (listed as SWEET1.ASC on KeelyNet)
                                        and
                  "On a Testable Unification of Electromagnetics,
                    General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics"
               by Tom E. Bearden and Walter Rosenthal (pp. 487-492)
                        (listed as SWEET2.ASC on KeelyNet)

       Except for the unsupported conjectures  dealing  with  mind, thought
       and life, which  bring  his  results  almost  into the  metaphysical
       realm, I find  these  papers  to  be very intriguing and compelling.
       Thus, with the permission of Mr.  Bearden,  I  am  posting  them  to
       sci.physics and alt.sci.physics.new-theories.  (I'll  start with the
       paper "On a   Testable   Unification  of  Electromagnetics,  General
       Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics".)

       As you can see in the "Followup-To:"  line,  I  would  like  to  see
       discussion appear in alt.sci.physics.new-theories, since that is the
       most appropriate place  for  discussion.   If  your  site  does  not
       receive a.s.p.n., then  let me know, and I can send you summaries of
       whatever discussion follows (hopefully  a  lot).  Of course, if your
       site doesn't receive a.s.p.n, then ask your sysadmin  if it would be
       possible to receive it.

       BTW, Mr. Bearden  is  not (yet) on the net, but he has agreed to let
       me be a go-between, and I'll try  to  post  his comments on whatever
       discussion ensues.  I  encourage everybody to find  Whittaker's  two
       papers and Maxwell's  original  treatise  on  electromagnetic theory
       (see the papers for the exact citations) and to read them carefully.

       I hope you find these papers as intriguing  as  I  have.  If nothing
       else, it will help you to firm up your foundation of physics.

       the discussion to develop into a flame war.

                                     ABSTRACT

       Based on E.T.  Whittaker's  previously  unnoticed  1903-1904  papers
       which established a  hidden  bidirectional  EM  wave  structure in a
       standing forcefield free scalar  potential,  a  method  of  directly
       engineering the ambient potential of the vacuum has  been  developed
       and realized experimentally.

       Adding Whittaker's engineerable  hidden variable theory to classical
       electro-magnetics, quantum mechanics,    and    general   relativity
       produces supersets of each discipline.  These supersets  are  joined
       by the common  Whittaker  subset,  producing  a unified field theory
       that is engineerable and tested.

       By treating the nucleus of the atom  as  a  pumped  phase  conjugate
       mirror, several working model energy units have been  produced which
       excite and organize  the  local  vacuum,  increase the local virtual
       photon flux between local vacuum  and  nucleus,  establish  coherent
       self-oscillations between the local excited vacuum  and the affected
       nuclei, utilize the  self-oscillating standing wave for self-pumping
       of the nuclei/mirrors, introduce  a  very  tiny  signal  wave to the
       mirrors, and output  into  an  external  load  circuit  a  powerful,
       amplified, time-reversed phase  conjugate  replica  wave at 60 Hertz
       frequency and nominal 120 volt sine wave power.

       Several models have been built, ranging from 6 watts early on to one
       of 5 kilowatts.    Both   closed  batteryless  systems  with  damped
       positive feedback and open loop systems with battery-powered input
       have been successfully built.  Open loop power gains of from 5 x 104
       to 1.5 x 106 have been achieved.

       Antigravity experiments have also  been successfully conducted where
       the weight of the unit was reduced by 90% in controlled experiments,
       with a signal  wave  input  of 175 microwatts and  an  output  of  1
       kilowatt.

       The basic theory of the device is briefly explained and experimental
       results presented.  In the demonstration session, a videotape of one
       operating open-loop unit  with a 1.5 x 106 power gain is planned, as
       is the demonstration of an actual  working  model closed-loop system
       with a nominal rating of 500 watts, and without external power input
       of any kind.

       The units are  solid  state,  with no moving parts.   Each  of  them
       comprises a unique   form   of   self-powered   vacuum   triode   of
       extraordinary gain, where the cathode  power  and  plate  power  are
       freely furnished by the vacuum, and only a small grid signal need be
       furnished either from  an  external  power  source   or  by  clamped
       positive feedback from  the device's output.  The output is negative
       energy, and some of its unique characteristics are pointed out.

       Implications of the experimental  application  of  the  Sweet vacuum
       triode, the Bearden  approach  to  the  nucleus as  a  pumped  phase
       conjugate mirror, and  the unified field theory based on Whittaker's
       engineerable hidden variable scalar  EM  potential  theory  are also
       briefly addressed.

       NOTE

       This paper has been prepared by Bearden, the second  author  listed,
       hereinafter called "the   author",  with  full  concurrence  of  the
       inventor of the  vacuum  triode,  inventor  and  magnetics  engineer
       Sweet, the first author listed.

       SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS

       In 1837 Sir W.R. Hamilton said,

            "The notion  of time may be unfolded into an  independent  pure
             science... a science of pure time is possible."

       As is well-known,  the  fundamental  units  utilized  in physics are
       arbitrary.  It is even possible to  construct  all  of  physics on a
       single unit, time.   This  oddity  shows  the  truth  in  Hamilton's
       statement; it is even more odd, because quantum mechanically time is
       not an observable.   This  means  that  the  observable world can be
       modeled completely in  terms  of   the   nonobservable,   which   is
       essentially what modern quantum mechanics is now doing.

       Hamilton viewed his  magnificent  quaternions as essentially  having
       accomplished the mathematical   structuring   of   time.   Maxwell's
       original EM theory,  as is well-known,  was  modeled  in  Hamilton's
       quaternions, not in  the  highly  curtailed Heaviside/Hertz  vectors
       erroneously taught today as "Maxwell's theory."

                                      Page 3





       Not a single one of the present so-called "Maxwell's" vector
       equations ever appeared in a book or paper by James Clerk Maxwell.

       For some years the author has worked on an extended electromagnetics
       theory, involving the scalar component of the quaternion. [ref. 1]

       In Maxwell's original quaternion theory, this scalar component often
       remains when the  directional  components  zero.   Further,  it then
       enfolds vectors and  functions  of   vectors  inside,  in  a  hidden
       variable manner.  Specifically, the author has patterned  a  unified
       field theory concept  upon  the  previously unnoticed but remarkable
       early work of E.T. Whittaker. [ref. 2]

       In two fundamental papers in 1903  and  1904,  Whittaker showed that
       all present vector   EM   can   be  replaced  by  scalar   potential
       interferometry, and that  bidirectional  harmonic EM plane wave sets
       could be used  to  produce  a  standing   wave  of  force-field-free
       potential (Figures 1 and 2).

       Thus Whittaker anticipated the quantum

       to the macroscopic  world  instead  of the mesoscopic realm where it
       has been established to date. [ref. 3]

       In modern terms, Whittaker showed  how  to  turn EM wave energy into
       electrogravitational potential energy,  then  how to  interfere  two
       such scalar potential  waves to recover electromagnetic energy, even
       at a distance. [ref. 4]

       This unrecognized work  is  of great  importance:  when  applied  to
       modern physics, it  produces  supersets of quantum  mechanics  (QM),
       classical electromagnetics (EM), and general relativity (GR).

       Further, all three   extended  disciplines  unify  on  their  common
       Whittaker subset, in a testable and engineerable fashion. [ref. 5]

       The Nucleus As a PPCM and Triode

       The author has also considered the highly nonlinear  nucleus  of the
       atom as a  pumped  phase  conjugate  mirror  (PPCM), having found no
       other consideration of same in the literature.

       The author also dubbed a PPCM a "triode,"  since the amplified phase
       conjugate replica of  the  signal  wave is much like  the  amplified
       output of a triode, and the signal wave input to a PPCM is much like
       a triode's grid signal input. The PPCM pump wave then corresponds
       roughly to the  power  input  to  the cathode and plate of a triode.
       [ref. 6]

       triode.  [Referring to figure 3]

       VACUUM TRIODE BACKGROUND

       About seven years ago, the author was privileged to  see and examine
       an invention of  Mr.  Floyd  Sweet,  that  produced about 6 watts of
       electrical power from the vacuum itself.

       This remarkable device, which the  author dubbed a vacuum triode, in
       a single unit utilized most of the scalar EM concepts the author had
       so painfully and slowly formulated over the years.

       Sweet, a brilliant   inventor   with  a  remarkable   knowledge   of
       magnetics, had utilized  barium ferrite magnets and special coils to
       produce a solid-state device that  successfully  tapped  the  vacuum
       energy.

       The author quickly  put  together  a  theoretical  concept  for  the
       energy-tapping mechanism, based  on  treatment  of  the nucleus as a
       PPCM and Whittaker's scalar EM potential unified field theory. [ref.
       7]

       The author furnished the technical  concept, treating the nucleus as
       a pumped phase conjugate mirror, to the inventor along  with  copies
       of Whittaker's papers.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Sweet's Synthesis and Extension

       Sweet is also a brilliant EM theoretician, working in four, five, or
       even six dimensions  with  ease.   He  immediately  synthesized  the
       entire PPCM and  Whittaker  theory,   and   developed   a   complete
       theoretical treatment of the device. [ref. 8]

       He also increased the nuclear potential utilized  in  the  activated
       nuclei of the  device,  which increased the pumping energy and hence
       the energy output.  He next produced an open-loop vacuum triode (VT)
       with an output of 500 watts, for an input of 33 microwatts.

       Thereafter he produced several other  models,  including closed-loop
       systems and one with 5-KW output.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Purpose of This Paper

       Our purpose is  to  explain the detailed scalar EM  concept  of  the
       operation of the  vacuum  triode, since it is a universal method for
       cohering and tapping useful EM energy from the vacuum.

       The author believes that this mechanism is the fundamental mechanism
       that must be    invoked    in    any    over-unity    device    that
       electromagnetically extracts vacuum   energy   as    electromagnetic
       effects.

       We also intend  to demonstrate a full working model of the device at
       this conference.  Sweet's detailed  theoretical  treatment  will  be
       completed and submitted to a major journal shortly,  to complete the
       scientific exposition of the new methodology.

       I must also  express  my  deep  admiration for my brilliant inventor
       colleague.  It has been a privilege  to  work with him, though under
       great difficulties and  at  a  distance.   He has developed  several
       other related devices  that  are of great importance to the emerging
       new physics of vacuum engineering,  in the sense referred to by Lee.
       [ref. 9]

       To mention just  one,  he  has  produced  a  magnetic   lens   which
       apparently can directly  display the vacuum's virtual particle flux,
       or a good analog of it.  So far  as  I  am  aware,  this is the only
       extant instrument today that can perform this feat.

       When the vacuum triode has been proven to the scientific  community,
       it is my  intention  to  nominate  Sweet  for  the Nobel Prize he so
       richly deserves, and  seek  high  scientific  endorsements  for  the
       recommendation.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       INTRODUCTION

       Entropy

       As is well known, in any closed dynamic system the order existing in
       it will gradually  be  dissipated,  as  more  and more  interactions
       occur.  This leads  to  the  notion  of  entropy  as  the increasing
       disorder in such systems.  The assumptions are

            (1) a closed system, and
            (2) a positive flow of time for the components of the system.

                                      Page 6





       Actually no such  thing  as  a  completely  closed  system exists in
       nature.  Every mass system is open to virtual particle flux exchange
       with the vacuum, for example, particularly  in  the  nucleus  of its
       atoms, where the bulk of its mass is located.

       However, the closed system assumption is reasonably  approximated by
       a great many  systems which are in stable thermodynamic equilibrium,
       or nearly so.

       On the other  hand,  in  an  open   system  far  from  thermodynamic
       equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics does  not  necessarily
       apply, because the system violates both the closed system assumption
       and its equilibrium approximation.  [ref. 10]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Time Reversal

       Since being discovered  in  1972  in the open Soviet literature, the
       time-reversed (phase conjugate) EM  wave  has  also been known.  The
       phase conjugate EM wave is truly time-reversed, as  has  been  shown
       experimentally.  Since the time-reversed EM wave violates the second
       major assumption, the   second   law   of  thermodynamics  need  not
       necessarily hold for time-reversed entities.

       Putting all this  together,  if  one  wishes  negentropy  and  hence
       increased energy in a system, the candidate suggested  would  appear
       to be a system that was strongly

            (1) open loop,
            (2) time-reversed, and
            (3) far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

       A good overview  of  time-reversal  in  physics has been provided by
       Sachs.  [ref. 11]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Engineering the Nucleus

       Since the nucleus  already  provides   a   myriad  of  time-reversed
       processes, engineering the  nucleus  of  an  atom  is  a  very  good
       candidate for practical negentropy.

       To engineer the  nucleus  directly,  a  Whittaker potential is first
       artificially constructed, by composing  a  harmonic  set  of  phase-
       locked EM wave/antiwave  pairs.  It is accented that  the  antiwaves
       must be true phase conjugates;  otherwise they will not constitute a
       gradient-free Whittaker standing potential wave.

       In addition, at  least  one  harmonic  interval  must  be  used, and
       additional harmonic sets are most desirable.  The reason is that a
       space-time lattice must be formed in the vacuum, where the energy is
       additive spatially but oppositive  in  t-dot,  the  rate  of flow of
       time, in the fourth dimension.

       So a time-structure  is  required  as  well as a spatial  structure,
       which is what  is  provided by n bidirectional harmonic Whittaker EM
       wave sets, where n is an integer greater than 1.

       Once a specific  Whittaker structure  has  been  chosen,  the  local
       lattice of space-time is established.  This establishes phase-locked
       lattice groupings of coupled photon/antiphoton pairs, or of

                                      Page 7





       gravitons.  In turn,  this  Whittaker-structured vacuum now contains
       specific graviton vacuum  engines,   which   directly  engineer  and
       structure the vacuum's virtual particle flux (VPF) exchange with the
       nucleus.  [ref. 12]

       The nucleus is  highly nonlinear, hence strongly phase  conjugative,
       or time-reversed.  The   ambient   potential  of  the  local  vacuum
       surrounding the nucleus is in a violent virtual photon exchange with
       it, accounting for its electrical charge.

       Since the preponderant charge is positive, from the viewpoint of the
       ordinary light observer whose light  interacts with electron shells,
       the nucleus may   be   taken   to   exhibit  time  reversal   (phase
       conjugation).
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Energy, Time, and Gravitons

       We take the  definition  of "energy" to be fundamentally an ordering
       imposed upon the VPF of vacuum.  We  take photon scattering from the
       electron shells of  atoms  to be the fundamental exterior  mechanism
       producing forward flow of external observer time.

       It then follows  that  "time's  arrow" for the EM observer is due to
       the universal scattering of photons from electron shells.

       In this view, forward (positive)  time  flow  and entropy are due to
       the same primary action: photon scattering from electron shells.  It
       is unfortunate that the concept of "positive" energy  has  been tied
       to, and defined  in  terms of, the scattering and dissipation of VPF
       order as work, or energy expended.

       Via the standard   labeling,   then,    negative   energy   is   the
       reconstitution of order in the vacuum VPF.  It should be noted that,
       in a PPCM, dissipative or external pump wave stress  energy  can  be
       scavenged and re-emitted  in  perfect  order  as the phase conjugate
       replica.   This is a negentropic  process,  for  it  is  capable  of
       turning disorder into order. [ref. 13]

       In the time-reversed  PPCM  nucleus,  we  should   expect   to   see
       appreciable negative energy,  that  is,  energy  removed from the EM
       scattering domain.  This includes the binding energy of the nucleus,
       and the gravitational (G) potential  energy of the EM energy removed
       from the "scattering interaction realm" and locked into the mass.

       Following Sakharov, we  hold that the G-field is not  a  fundamental
       field of nature,  but  a  composite  caused  by, or made from, other
       fields.  [ref. 14]

       To the first  order,  we  assume the  G-potential  is  comprised  of
       coupled photon/antiphoton pairs,   on   the   average,   where   the
       statistical coupled spin-2  photon/antiphoton  pair  is  a graviton.
       [ref. 15]

       We follow the  modern  view  of   the   field:   because  of  vacuum
       fluctuations, rigorously one no longer speaks of "the" field, but of
       the probability of a particular field configuration. [ref. 16]

       We also hold the vacuum to be composed of potentials, and regard the
       three terms space-time, vacuum, and scalar potential  as essentially
       synonymous.
                                      Page 8





       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Newton's Third Law and the Detection Process

       The VPF EM  stress  of  the local vacuum immediately surrounding the
       nucleus may be decomposed a la Whittaker into opposing bidirectional
       EM plane waves/forces.  Thus the nonlinear  nucleus  may be regarded
       as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, normally with a gain of one.

       In this view, Newton's third law reaction force is generated because
       the so-called "photon"  interaction  with  an  atom  is  in  fact  a
       graviton reaction involving   a   photon/antiphoton   pair  that  is
       decoupled.

       The decoupled photon  normally is  absorbed  and  reradiated  by  an
       orbital electron, while the decoupled antiphoton interacts  with the
       nucleus, producing a  time-reversed  twin of the external force, or,
       in other words, Newton's third law  reaction  force,  which  gives a
       slight recoil of the nucleus.

       Half of every  measurement  physicists normally make  is  discarded,
       with the missing  half accounting only for Newtonian reaction in the
       meter or instrument, which is usually ignored.

       The fact that half of our measurement  interactions  are  ignored is
       occasionally discovered and noted by physicists, who  may even write
       a paper pointing  it  out,  but  no  change  is  instituted  in  the
       foundations. [ref. 17 and 18]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Semiconducting Vacuum and Self-Oscillation

       The vacuum immediately surrounding  the nucleus is structured by the
       nucleus, and is  itself  nonlinear  and  capable   of  acting  as  a
       semiconductor.  [ref. 19]

       Since both this  immediately  local  semiconductor  vacuum  and  the
       nucleus it surrounds are highly nonlinear,  then nonlinear resonance
       can conceivably be established between them.

       Further, since the resonating system in such case is  an open system
       away from thermodynamic  equilibrium,  the  oscillation can be self-
       sustaining.  Such self-oscillation  of  the  pumping  of  a  PCM  is
       already well-known in the nonlinear optical literature, particularly
       with compounds containing barium. [ref. 20]
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       THE VACUUM TRIODE

       The Basic Concept

       As is well-known, a stress can be decomposed into opposing  sets  of
       forces.  But quantum  mechanically,  the forces we are interested in
       with our work  here  are  all  caused  electromagnetically,  by  the
       exchange of virtual  photons.  Even mechanical force,  according  to
       QM, is caused  in  this  manner.   Thus  opposing electromagnetic or
       mechanical "stress" sets   of    bidirectional    EM    forces   are
       microscopically equivalent to the notion of pump waves  in nonlinear
       optics.

       Hence under the proper conditions, it follows that trapped EM stress
       energy of the vacuum can be utilized to "pump" the nucleus.

                                      Page 9





       Treating the stress-pumped  nonlinear  nucleus as a PPCM, it follows
       that the stress energy of the vacuum  can  be  tapped  by  a  4-wave
       mixing mechanism in the atomic nucleus, to provide  amplified  phase
       conjugate EM wave  outputs from the atom in response to small signal
       wave inputs. [21]

       In the proper nonlinear material, the material may act as a PPCM, in
       which case there exists a suitable connection between the material's
       atomic nuclei and its external electromagnetic  lattice  bonds,  and
       the amplified phase conjugate replica wave generated  in the nucleus
       will be emitted from the material as an EM wave field.  This field
       can then be  tapped by suitable means and output to an external load
       circuit.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Block Diagram of the Vacuum Triode

       Figure 4 shows a basic block diagram  of  the vacuum triode process,
       utilized by Sweet  in  several  laboratory  vacuum  energy  devices.
       These devices have  ranged from a nominal 500 watt output in a 6-lb.
       device to 5 kilowatts for a heavier  unit.   Gains  have ranged from
       50,000 to 1,500,000  for  open-loop  systems.   Both  open-loop  and
       closed-loop systems have been built and tested.

       Figure 4 shows  a combined block diagram for either a closed-loop or
       open-loop system.  In  the  open-loop   system,   a  barium  ferrite
       magnetic material is used as a pumped phase conjugate mirror.

       In the "standard"  design,  two  opposing  PPCMs   are   used.   The
       advantage of this  dual  combination  is  the  use of self-targeting
       (repetitive phase conjugation, signal  by  signal).   This  has  the
       effect of

            (1) stabilizing the Whittaker field, and
            (2) producing a quantum potential between the  two  mirrors, so
                the mirrors  and  the  Whittaker potential between them are
                essentially one single space-time entity.

       Discussion of a quantum potential is beyond the scope of this paper,
       but the technical mechanism for creating  one  has  been  previously
       presented by the author on several occasions. [ref. 22]

       First we will explain the open-loop operation of the  vacuum triode.
       In Figure 4, on the right an external 60 Hz, nominal 10 volt AC sine
       wave of several  tens  of  microwatts  in  power  is  input into the
       stabilized field of the barium ferrite  magnet  structure,  where it
       modulates the field, producing a signal wave input into the atoms of
       the material.

       In the top  right  block,  the  EM  signal wave interacts  with  the
       electron shell of  an  atom,  which  in  turn  is  EM-coupled to the
       nucleus.
       ********************************************************************
       [This figure could not be effectively  depicted  in  ASCII.  See the
       original paper]

       Figure 4.  The Vacuum Triode Concept.
       ********************************************************************
       Thus an EM signal wave is input to the nucleus of the atom, which is
       highly nonlinear (middle top block).  Earlier, Sweet had

                                      Page 10





       specifically conditioned the   atomic   nuclei  with  a  proprietary
       process, wherein in the barium nucleus  a  trapped  60  Hz scalar EM
       spherical wave resonance  (self-oscillation)  exists   between   the
       structured semiconductor vacuum immediately surrounding the Ba
       nucleus.

       In the same   activation  process,  the  ambient  potential  of  the
       surrounding vacuum was raised and  stabilized,  in  the two leftmost
       blocks.

       At this point  the nonlinear nucleus is effectively  self-pumped  by
       the trapped, excited,  spherical scalar wave oscillation between the
       structured semiconductor vacuum and the nucleus.  The nucleus is now
       a strongly pumped phase conjugate mirror.

       Consequently, when the signal wave  input  arrives, the PPCM nucleus
       emits an amplified  phase  conjugate  replica  (PCR)   wave,   which
       precisely backtracks the    input   signal   wave.    This   precise
       backtracking (perfect retroreflection)   is   referred   to  as  the
       "distortion correction theorem."

       In short, the  powerful  PCR  wave  returns  precisely   toward  the
       external source, passing through the electron shells and arriving in
       the perturbed barium   ferrite   magnet  assembly  field,  where  it
       perturbs the field.

       A transformer-like system  then   extracts   this   magnetic   field
       perturbation and conducts it to the external load circuit.

       However, the PCR contains negative energy.  Short of  the  load, the
       internal circuits run   cool,   rather  than  heating.   This  is  a
       signature of a true vacuum energy tapping device.

       Indeed, if the  output  leads  of   the   Sweet  vacuum  triode  are
       physically shorted together, a brilliant flash occurs, and the
       leads instantly ice as if dipped in liquid oxygen.   This is another
       signature of the true negentropic over-unity vacuum tap.

       Note that the   energy  extracted  from  the  semiconducting  vacuum
       adjacent to the  nucleus  is  just   instantly   replaced   by   the
       surrounding vacuum's inexhaustible energy pool.   This  is  an open-
       loop system, with  a  hidden  energy  source:   the  intense virtual
       particle flux of the vacuum's ambient charge.

       It is not possible to exhaust that  flux,  which is often calculated
       to have an energy density of some 10^100 or more grams  per cm^3, if
       the energy were cohered and condensed into mass.

       As can be  seen,  even  a VT gain of 1.5 x 10^6 represents a "vacuum
       tap" of an incredibly small efficiency,  on  the order of 10^-100 or
       so.  However, the   vacuum  "river"  is  so  energetic   that   such
       efficiencies are quite sufficient.

       We accent that   the   barium  ferrite  magnetic  material  must  be
       activated so that stable self-oscillation between the barium nucleus
       and the surrounding semiconductor  vacuum  exists.   Although  self-
       oscillating/self-pumped PCMs are known at optical frequencies, Sweet
       has discovered and perfected a brilliant methodology  for activating
       PPCM nuclei at ELF frequencies.

                                      Page 11





       In a resistive  load  such  as  light  bulbs, the resistive material
       accomplishes repetitive phase conjugation.   Thus  in  the resistor,
       half the total  energy is expressed as photon or dissipative  energy
       in the external (electron shell) level.

       As the excited electrons decay, they emit scattered EM energy as
       light and heat.   This is an exothermic interaction.  The other half
       of the total  energy  reacts  in  the  atomic  nuclei,  as  a  phase
       conjugative or endothermic interaction.

       We strongly accent    that,    Whittaker-wise,   there    are    two
       electromagnetic channels and two kinds of EM:

            (1) external   EM,   the   common  electron-shell  interacting,
                entropic, scattering, time-forward kind, and
            (2) the   internal,  unsuspected,   hidden   variable,   nuclei
                interacting, negentropic, reordering/convergent kind.

       Internal EM travels  strictly  between atomic nuclei,  normally  not
       reacting with electron shells unless a pumped phase conjugate mirror
       reaction is invoked  in  the  nucleus  to  produce  a  gain somewhat
       greater than unity.

       Thus if we  wish to communicate with  atomic  nuclei  directly,  and
       engineer them directly, we must utilize the internal  EM channel via
       applied Whittaker methods.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Antigravity Tests

       Inherent in the  preceding discussions is the possibility to turn EM
       energy into gravitational energy  of  either  sign.  In other words,
       one should be able to utilize Sweet's vacuum triode  to  produce and
       demonstrate antigravity.

       Indeed this is  the  case.   Sweet  has  also discovered the special
       alterations necessary to perform straightforward  transformation  of
       the internal energy  in  the  nucleus  to antigravitational  energy,
       producing a unilateral thrust upward.

       Note that the  bulk  of  G-potential gradient (G-force-field) occurs
       Whittaker-wise at ELF  frequencies.   This  explains  why  nonlinear
       phase conjugate opticians do not notice direct antigravity effects.

       At the optical frequencies at which they work, the  effects  are  so
       miniscule that they  are  negligible.   This is readily explained as
       follows:  In QM,  the  quantum  (photon)   is  comprised  of  action
       (angular momentum), not just energy.  It is rather  like a "piece of
       energy welded to a piece of time, with no seam in the middle."

       Since quantum change occurs in quanta, the decoupling of the energy
       and time components,  in  the  continual interaction of photons with
       matter, exchanges energy between G-potential  of  vacuum and trapped
       mass of the atom or particle.  In this exchange, small increments of
       time are continually being formed (and unformed, as  photon emission
       occurs).

       Consequently, each mass   is   moving   forward  in  time  in  small
       incremental jumps, usually of exceedingly small magnitude.  However,
       the energy and time trapped in a photon are canonical.  The greater

                                      Page 12





       the piece of energy, the smaller the piece of time, and vice versa.

       So if one wishes to stress the "rate of flow of time" significantly,
       one needs to  produce  large amounts of photons that have very large
       pieces of time, and consequently little pieces of energy.

       Since the energy  of  the photon is  directly  proportional  to  its
       frequency, this means that the lower frequency photons  have  larger
       time increments, and  hence  endure  over many "regular-sized photon
       absorption/emission changes" to appreciably  stress the rate of time
       flow/production.

       The bottom line  is that the standard pumped phase conjugate  mirror
       can be adapted  to  produce  antigravity  at  ELF  frequencies,  but
       precisely the same  adaptation  at  optical  frequencies  will  have
       negligible effect.

       With this in  mind,  the  author  requested  Sweet   to  perform  an
       antigravity experiment to    prove   the   thesis.    With   Sweet's
       proprietary adaptation of  his vacuum  triode/PPCM,  the  experiment
       produced rather straightforward but spectacular results, as shown in
       Figure 5.

       The experiment was  performed as follows:  Rigged  for  antigravity,
       the 6-lb. device  was  placed on a scale so that its weight could be
       continuously monitored.  A special external load box was utilized in
       which multiple electric light sockets were connected in parallel.

       Then the external load draw was adjusted  by merely screwing in 100-
       watt lamps, one  at a time, with measurement and observation  pauses
       in between.  The  output  of  the  device  was 120 volt, negative AC
       sine-wave power at 60 Hz.

       For each 100-watt increment, the  load  power  was  recorded and the
       weight was carefully recorded.  The results are shown  in the rather
       smooth, classic curve shown in Figure 5.

       At 1,000 watts  load  draw,  the previously 6-lb. device had reduced
       its weight due to gravity by 90 percent.   At that point the signal-
       wave (grid) input  to  the open-loop vacuum triode  was  only  175.4
       microamps at 10 volts, or just under two milliwatts.

       Figure 5.  Antigravity Test of Sweet's Adapted Vacuum Triode.
       ********************************************************************
       We accent that the nominal two milliwatt  input  is  only  a  gating
       signal.  It is the organized, gated vacuum energy that is performing
       the action.

       The experiment was stopped short of actual hovering  and  flying due
       to safety considerations.   With  the  specific adaptation, magnetic
       monopoles are deposited in the magnet  materials, producing internal
       tensile stress.

       Since no explosive controlled facilities were available,  and  there
       was no wish  to destroy the VT, the experiment was terminated at 90%
       antigravity performance.

       It was completely   successful,   and  adequately  demonstrated  the
       validity of the  unified  field  theory  concepts  utilized  in  our
       approach.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       CONCLUSIONS

       A new unified field theory has been developed, tested,  and at least
       partially verified experimentally.   The concepts of the theory have
       been applied by Sweet in a series of inventions that produce readily
       usable, safe electromagnetic power directly from the vacuum.

       The methodology lends itself to formulation of power devices without
       moving parts.  Antigravity, predicted by the concepts of the theory,
       has been demonstrated  in actual  practical  demonstrations  on  the
       laboratory bench.

       Though not discussed in this paper, application of  the concepts and
       methodology to a  large  variety  of  other  fields, such as medical
       reversal of aging and curing of almost  the  entire range of present
       debilitating diseases, has been previously pointed out.
       [ref. 23]

       We have also   pointed   out   the   mechanism   for   Kaznacheyev's
       cytopathogenic effect, or  the  induction of cellular pathology at a
       distance by electromagnetic means. [ref. 24]

       We have also pointed out the specific mechanism involved in Priore's
       device, which in  rigorous  laboratory   animal  testing  under  the
       auspices of eminent  French  scientists,  demonstrated   nearly  100
       percent cures for terminal cancers and leukemias, sleeping sickness,
       artherosclerosis, and other debilitating diseases.[ref. 25]

       We believe we  have  also  produced the concepts enabling the direct
       engineering and therapeutic manipulation  of  Popp's master cellular
       control system.  [ref. 26]

       We conclude that  the  concepts we have utilized and  experimentally
       demonstrated are universal, as implied by any notional unified field
       theory.

       Our conclusion is  that the concepts, theory, and experiments, taken
       together, are sufficient for investigation  and  replication  by the
       scientific community.

       If replicated and  fully  substantiated, we believe  the  work  will
       directly point the  way to, and usher in, a new unified field theory
       physics of universal application.

       SPECULATED IMPLICATIONS

       As can be seen, the implications of  the  new approach are profound.
       The authors believe they have ushered in the forerunner  of  a  vast
       new physics, one  which  will  change  our  lives,  and  our view of
       physical reality, in ways previously undreamed of.

       By mastering, controlling, and gating the vast, incredible energy of
       the seething vacuum, we can power  our automobiles, flying machines,
       and technology inexhaustibly.   Further, it can be  done  absolutely
       cleanly; there are no noxious chemical pollutants to poison the

                                      Page 14





       biosphere.  With practical  antigravity,  ships  can be developed to
       cross the solar system as readily as one crosses the ocean today.

       And the ships, automobiles, and technology  will  never  run  out of
       fuel;  the inexhaustible vacuum fills every system,  everywhere,  to
       overflowing.

       Not discussed in this paper, it turns out that living systems, faced
       with the problem  of  achieving  negentropy  so as to maintain their
       form in a dissipative external physical  reality,  have  always used
       the hidden internal channel for such things as mind,  thought,  cell
       control, and living functions.

       With the new  methodology,  one  now  faces the advent of access and
       engineering of the mind and life of  the  observer as readily as the
       observer's physical body.

       Transmutation of the elements, control of the weather,  lighting and
       powering our cities  and homes cheaply and cleanly, and provision of
       plenty for everyone is the vista  for  the  future.   We can in fact
       clean up the radioactive wastes, rid ourselves of coarse nuclear and
       petroleum powerplants.

       We strongly stress   that,   with  the  ability  to   engineer   the
       Schroedinger equation itself, the new methodology allows the direct
       engineering and control  of  quantum  change,  and hence of physical
       reality itself.

       The methodology is  extendable to  hyperdimensions;  nested  virtual
       levels of the  vacuum are already precisely that.   The  author  has
       already pointed out  the  application of this emerging technology to
       the absolute cure of diseases such  as AIDS, cancer, leukemia, etc.,
       and shown that  the  Priore  device  in  France already  proved  the
       efficacy of the application in the 60s and 70s.

       We shall be able to rid ourselves and our descendents of diseases.
       With direct access  to  the actual software of life and mind, in the
       future we should be able to achieve  levels  of education previously
       unattainable, by directly inputting the relevant software.

       Previously we have also pointed out that four nations  of  the world
       are already embarked  on  weaponization  of  scalar EM unified field
       technology.  It is sobering to think that, in addition to having the
       ability to make our planet a paradise  for  humankind,  we also will
       have the ability to make it a hades.

       For that reason,  we  are  doing our best to clarify  the  technical
       concept and the  theory  in  this 1991, hopefully with the view that
       humankind will seize  upon the positive  aspects,  and  develop  and
       apply this technology for the betterment of all people everywhere.

       Long ago, Albert Einstein said these words:

            "It would of course be a great step forward if  we succeeded in
             combining the  gravitational  field  and  the  electromagnetic
             field into a single structure.   Only  so  could  the  era  in
             theoretical physics inaugurated by Faraday and  Clerk  Maxwell
             be brought to a satisfactory close."








       And Teilhard de Chardin wrote:

            "Someday, after  we  have  mastered  the  winds, the waves, the
             tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of
             love.  Then for the second  time  in  the history of the world
             man will have discovered fire."

       The authors fervently  believe  they  have come upon  fire  for  the
       second time, as  allegorized  by  de Chardin.  If so, let us all use
       the knowledge wisely.

                This paper  pointed out  the  primacy  of  the  potentials.
                Instead of  being  causative agents, the force  fields  are
                actually effects generated from the potentials.  This is in
                complete violation  of  both classical electromagnetics and
                classical dynamics,  but   it  is  absolutely  required  by
                quantum mechanics.   For  an  extensive discussion  of  the

         [4]   It  is  pointed out that today all potentials are well-known
               to be gravitational entities.   However,  this was not known
               in Whittaker's time, and so he himself did  not realize that
               he had  actually  produced an engineerable, testable unified
               theory of electromagnetics and gravitation.

               Electronics, 3rd  Edn., Holt,  Rinehart,  and  Winston,  New
               York, 1985.   In a normal triode tube, the  amplified  plate
               signal is  180  degrees out of phase spatially with the grid
               input, but in-phase with  it  in  respect  to  rate  of flow
               through time.   In  a  PPCM, the amplified  phase  conjugate
               replica wave is in phase spatially with the signal wave, but
               180 degrees  out  of phase with it in respect to its rate of
               flow through time.  It is pointed out that a PCM with a gain
               of unity  produces a coupled  EM  wave/antiwave  pair  whose
               energy is additive in 3-space but subtractive  in  the first
               derivative of  the  fourth  dimension, time.  Hence it is no
               longer an electromagnetic  wave  as such, but an oscillatory
               wave of stress upon the local rate of flow  of  time.  Hence
               it is  a powerful electrogravitational wave, whose EM nature
               is hidden in the guise of a scalar EM potential.  It is also
               a wave of variation in the  local gauge, and of variation in
               the local ST curvature.

         [12]  Note that this moves the entire notion of  the  charge  of a
               fundamental particle  to  a  deeper and more extended level.
               Now the charge may be discretized,  but  it is not quantized
               in the  hard  conventional  sense.   Further,  the  internal
               Whittaker structure  of  the massless VPF photon exchange of
               vacuum and mass, which, quantum mechanically, is what the

                                      Page 17





               electrical charge of the particle is in the first place, is
               deterministically structured.   Note  that this violates the
               present assumption  that  all  like  charged  particles  are
               identical; now  two electrons may have either  the  same  or
               different magnitudes of charge, and even when the magnitudes
               are the  same,  their  internal charge structures (Whittaker
               structures) and VPF exchange  with  the  vacuum  may differ.
               Also note  that  this  resolves  the severe  QM  problem  of
               missing chaos  (hidden order) in quantum change.  The reason
               for the problem was the use  of  Gibbs  statistics  with its
               assumption of  random  variable  change,   which   a  priori
               excluded hidden  order  (and hence chaos) from QM.  That was
               only a special case, albeit an important one.  There are now
               three QM cases:  (1) the conventional  case,  where there is
               no hidden order;  (2) the case where there  is  some  hidden
               order, and  the  statistics is chaotic, not random;  and (3)
               the case  where  the  QM   change   is  deterministic,  with
               essentially total  hidden  order.  Note that  the  Whittaker
               methodology allows  one  to  directly engineer cases (2) and
               (3), including the Schroedinger equation itself.

         [13]  The present second law of thermodynamics is written only for
               time-forward entities, and  need  not  apply  for  the time-
               reversed   case.    Merely  viewing  the  energy-dissipating
               forward time  case  in reverse allows an appreciation of the
               time-reversed case.  In  other  words,  the  second  law  of
               thermodynamics is  incomplete  as  presently   stated.   The
               complete law  has a corollary to cover the increase in order
               as the time-reversal of  the  system  increases.   Thus  the
               complete law consists of two parts: (1) the  entropic, time-
               forward case,  and  (2)  the negentropic time-reversed case.
               Since the re-ordering can  be  amplified  at  will by a PPCM
               process, the correct distinction between the  two subsets of
               the complete law is important, and applies to real systems.

         [18]  A nonlinear material may simply emit a photon, or it may act
               as a phase conjugate mirror (PCM) and emit a phase conjugate
               replica of  the  absorbed photon.  When the material emits a
               normal photon, it measurably recoils.  When it emits a time-
               reversed photon,   it    does   not   recoil,   as   already
               experimentally established  in  nonlinear   phase  conjugate
               optics.  The  solution to the mystery is this: When emitting
               a normal photon, the material  does  not  act  as a PCM.  In
               that case  the  matching  antiphoton which  split  from  the
               interacting graviton (the graviton that yielded the external

                                      Page 18





               photon) interacts  with  the  nucleus,  producing  a  recoil
               action with a gain of one.  Thus Newtonian third-law
               recoil of the nucleus occurs.   On  the other hand, when the
               material acts as a PCM, it also emits the antiphoton outside
               the atom to "backtrack" the absorbed "signal  wave"  photon.
               In that  case  there  is no Newtonian recoil of the nucleus,
               because the agent for causing  recoil  did not interact with
               the nucleus to produce it.
