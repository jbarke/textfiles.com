                        A NEW BEGINNING FOR THERMODYNAMICS

                                        by

                                 Josef Hasslberger
                                 Rome, 8 May 1993

       The reactions and questions received on my articles "Vortex - The
       natural movement" and Understanding Water Power" show that there is
       much interest in the subject of thermodynamics.

       In fact, the "laws of thermodynamics" have long been the subject of
       heated debate, especially between the promoters and the detractors
       of another field, that of "perpetual motion".

       Joachim  Kirchhoff,  who  has  done  a  thorough  research  on the
       development and the history of thermodynamics (1) has shown that
       these laws, and especially the basic assumption of conservation of
       energy, can be traced back to an authoritative pronunciation of the
       Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, made in the year 1775, saying
       henceforth,  the  Academy  "will  no  longer  accept  or  deal  with
       proposals concerning perpetual motion".  Their reasoning was, that
       perpetual motion is impossible to achieve and that the search for
       it, is time consuming and very expensive.  According to the members
       of  the  academy,  those  bright  minds  dedicating  their  time and
       resources to this search, could be utilized much better in other,
       more reasonable endeavors.

       So  the  fact  that  until  that  time,  no  one  had  succeeded  in
       constructing a workable device of "perpetual motion", was used as
       the reason to forbid, de facto, any further research in that
       direction.  The "laws" thus established and enshrined as the laws of
       thermodynamics, have entered the official screening process of all
       new inventions.  Patent offices all over the world have more or less
       consistently refused since then, to grant recognition to anything
       that was, in their opinion, infringing upon these laws.

       Herbrand writes (2) that Professor Pollermann of the Julich Atomic
       Research Institute in Germany, who is an "expert" pre-examiner of
       patents in the energy sector, has given a negative opinion on 43% of
       the patent applications referred to him!  He reasons that "the
       natural laws accepted by science must be followed" and says that

                                      Page 1





       many people (in his view irrationally) "wish to make use of the
       eternal forces of gravitation and magnetism".

       We can see from this how efficient our current patent system is in
       suppressing any real renewal in the field of physics.  I have
       written about the subject of patents in an earlier article (3).

       CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

       There is such a thing as conservation of energy.  However our
       understanding of the concept is largely incomplete.  By negating the
       idea of an ether, which I called "space background" (4), we have
       limited our conception of energy to that which is observable on the
       purely physical plane.  All electric and magnetic as well as
       gravitational phenomena however, are not purely physical.  They
       require  for  their  understanding,  a  conception  of  a higher-
       dimensional space background, which is, to use the term of Moray, a
       "sea of energy".

       Conservation of energy in the current form of understanding is a
       useless concept, as it negates the existence of this giant reservoir
       of energy, and does not take into account the constant interchange
       (through the phenomena of electricity, magnetism and gravitation),
       of our world of physical existence with that reservoir.  Generation
       of electrical energy through magnetism for example, is not limited
       to the mechanical motive power applied to a generator and the
       movement  of  electrons  through  a  wire,  but  involves  a complex
       exchange between space background and physical machinery.

       In this context, it may be profitable to remember a statement that
       Robert Myer (5) made in connection with the concept of conservation
       of energy.  He said: "Seeing gravity as the cause of the falling of
       things, we talk about gravitation and thereby overlook, that an
       essential characteristic of an 'force' (energy) is to unify within
       itself, the attributes of indestructibility and mutability."

       This statement should set us thinking.  Meyer in fact asserts that
       energy, in addition to being indestructible, is also able to change
       form.  This implies that we can not necessarily think in terms of
       unidirectional  mutability,  a  concept  which  thermodynamics  has
       however maintained since the inception of its famous "laws".

       Now  the  specific  form  of  energy  which  is  the  subject  of
       thermodynamics is heat.

       WHAT IS HEAT?

       As  a  first  step  in  our  approach  to  the  understanding  of
       thermodynamics, we must try to understand what is this substance
       that forms the basis of the theory.  Heat has at first been imagined
       to be a fluid and has been given the name "caloric".  Soon caloric
       theory, which was at the basis of our famous "laws", gave way to the
       contemporary understanding, that heat is an excited state of matter,
       transferred through direct contact or through the mediation of
       electromagnetic waves of the infrared band.  Absence of heat, or the
       temperature of absolute zero, is defined as a complete absence of
       molecular motion.



                                      Page 2





       We shall, for the time being, accept this concept and add some other
       thoughts:

            o  Heat is a property of matter.  Without matter, no
               heat.

            o  The molecular motion that we call heat is a chaotic,
               a random motion.

            o  An increase of heat is an increase of randomity in
               matter.  A decrease in heat denotes progressively
               greater order of molecular alignment.

       TWO KINDS OF MOTION

       In this universe, we have two basic kind of motion:

                           centrifugal and centripetal,

       Centrifugal motion is outward directed.  It is an expanding, a
       radiating, explosive motion.  It has a tendency to increase the
       randomity in matter and thereby cause heat.

       This is the this kind of motion we are accustomed to.  It has been
       used in our technology since the discovery of fire, and especially
       since  the  invention  of  the  steam  engine  and  the consequent
       industrial revolution.  Our continued and exclusive use of this
       motion  has  given  us  useful  but  dangerous  machinery, polluting
       internal combustion engines, radio and microwave technology that has
       definite negative effect on human, animal and plant life and last
       but not least, the daughter of the atomic bomb, our atomic power
       plant, which is little more than a steam turbine using a very
       dangerous source of heat, radioactive uranium.

       We do not have to look far to see the results of this technology:  A
       decrease in atmospheric oxygen from 30% to 21% since the start of
       the industrial revolution, a crisis of raw materials and energy of
       gigantic proportions just around the corner, and a situation where
       it is almost impossible today to find some clean air to breathe or
       some real fresh, healthy spring water to drink.

       Centripetal motion on the other hand, is inward directed.  It is a
       contracting, a gravitative, an implosive kind of motion.  It has a
       tendency to align and de-randomize the particles of matter and
       causes a decrease in temperature.  Centripetal motion is associated
       with the animating force we call life, which physics in its desire
       to be "objective" or "scientific", has steadfastly refused to look
       at.  Here we have the key to resolving the riddle of thermodynamics.

       We can see how nature, using both these type of motion in a balanced
       way, can ever regenerate itself.  It simply goes, over and over
       again, through a who cycle of

               chaos --->  build-up --->  decay --->  chaos,

       using the centripetal or vortex motion in the build-up part of the
       cycle and the radiative, heat generating motion in the decay part.

       ENTROPY

       The idea of entropy, of the constant and irreversible winding down
       of  the  universe,  was  introduced  with  the  second  law of
       thermodynamics.  This law is based on an observation of James Watt's
       steam machine, which was the only technological utilization of
       thermal energy available at the time.

       Entropy  is  associated  with  radiation.    It  signifies  an  ever
       increasing randomity of motion, an expenditure of the "innate energy
       of a system".  According to the current views of thermodynamics,
       there is no antidote to entropy.  Once expended, energy is said to
       be lost forever in that giant heat sink, which we imagine the vast
       reaches of the universe to be.

       One of the great minds of this century, an outsider to established
       science, has recognized the folly of this view and coined a term for
       the antidote.  He calls it syntropy.

       In his book "Cosmography", R. Buckminster Fuller writes (6): "The
       reader will discover that the inexorable course of the gradual
       running down of the energy of the universe - that is, entropy - is
       only part of the picture.  Entropy has a complementary phase, which
       we designated syntropy".

       We can now assert that syntropy is real, and that it is closely
       associated with the second kind motion discussed above, with the
       centripetal, the vortex motion.

       While  radiation  is  an  entropic  phenomenon,  gravitation  is  an
       expression of syntropy.

       GRAVITATION

       We know much about radiation, but comparatively little is known
       about its "negative" twin, gravitation.  I am using the term
       gravitation here in a much wider sense than is generally done in
       physics.  Gravitation in this context means an electromagnetic
       phenomenon associated with a vortex in space background.  It is a
       twin of radiation, only with the vector inversed.  Gravitation is a
       pulling phenomenon, and the effect we are most familiar with, is
       that  gravitation  keeps  us  firmly  glued  to  this  planet.   But
       gravitation is more than that.  It can manifest itself in just as
       wide a range of wavelengths as radiation.

       Gravitation  in  this  extended  sense,  explains  for  instance the
       phenomenon found in most "free energy" devices, which often show a
       marked cooling effect on their immediate environment.  This is
       simply radiation in reverse, caused by an independent source of
       gravitation, a point of attraction, which causes energy to  "inflow"
       towards that point, rather than expanding outwards from it, as we
       usually observe.

       Anti-gravity  thereby  becomes  accessible  to  engineering.    If
       gravitation  is  nothing  but  an  inverse  radiation,  a pulling
       phenomenon associated with a vortex, all we need to do in order to
       obtain levitation or anti-gravity, is to establish an independent
       source of gravitation and orient it in opposition to the gravitation


                                      Page 4





       of  this  planet.    Applications  in  space  propulsion  would be
       comparatively easy to engineer.

       How do we establish an independent source of gravitation?  We
       establish,  by  whatever  mean  available,  magnetic,  mechanic  or
       otherwise, a strong vortex in the background field of space.  There
       are numerous examples of such occurrences in the tales that surround
       the field of "free energy", that have not been understood so far and
       therefore were incredulously dismissed as the fantasies of a bunch
       of loonies.

       Maybe we should look at these phenomena again and try to understand
       them with the new conception we now have of gravity.

       THE THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE

       The thermodynamic cycle as currently understood is a one-way street.
       It leads from a source of heat (fuel) via combustion to motion, but
       the heat must be constantly renewed through more fuel, as it is
       "lost" to the environment in the process.  In an article based on
       the research of Viktor Schauberger, regarding the function of vortex
       motion,  Schaffer (7) writes in 1972:

       "If the second law (of thermodynamics) does not hold true in the
       case of vortex motion, one could postulate the following cycle:

          Heat --->  Vortex --->  Motion --->  Friction --->  Heat

       Vortices therefore should be able to change heat energy into motive
       energy.  This would necessitate an acceleration of flow and a
       cooling effect.  Both of these can be observed in the case of
       vortices."  I will not attempt to provide a mathematical description
       for the circular process, but in the terms used in this article, I
       want to restate what has be proposed by Schaffer, to put forth a new
       and radically different thermodynamic circular process:

       This is the natural thermodynamic cycle of this universe.

       Using this cycle, that is, using both the centrifugal and the
       centripetal part and thus establishing a stable pulsation, it will
       be possible to engineer new clean forms of motion-producing and
       energy-producing machinery, that do not depend on fuel such as
       petrol, coal or gas for their motion.  Does that sound like a
       perpetuum mobile?

       WHAT IS A PERPETUUM MOBILE?

       I think we have to reconsider our strict negation of the possibility
       of any perpetuum mobile, which ultimately is based on nothing other
       than the ideas of the honorable members of the French Academy of
       Sciences of 1775.  In fact, any machine which is constructed
       according to the principles of nature, using the cycle as described
       here,  will  have  characteristics  of  what  used  to  be  called a
       perpetuum mobile.

       This does not mean, that the law of conservation of energy is
       violated.

       We have found a way, in other words, to tap into the very wheelwork
       of nature an utilize its energies more efficiently.

       At this point, I would like to thank all those inventors who have
       encountered these phenomena in their research and who, despite a
       completely inadequate scientific basis, have persisted to make their
       inventions  reality.    I  would  like  to  acknowledge  that  their
       inventions are real.  Despite any refusal of patent examiners, and
       despite the usual incredulity they have encountered everywhere.

       It should also be said that this article would not have been
       possible without the immense work Viktor Schauberger has done in
       observing and describing the mechanics inherent in the vortex motion
       of water, and without those that have collected and published what
       was  left  of  Schauberger's  writing  to  keep  the  flame  of this
       knowledge alive for future generations.

       One last word about thermodynamics:  It seems that thing went wrong
       when we were trying to imagine a closed system.  This is something
       achievable only in theory.  Because every system existing within
       this universe in constant and continuous exchange with the rest of
       the universe.  And how this universe is made, what it consists of
       and how it functions, we have not even remotely begun to understand.
