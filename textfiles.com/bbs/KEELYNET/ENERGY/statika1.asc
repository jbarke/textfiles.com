                 Re: Magnetic motor from David Tiberio (Inventor)
                               --------------------
       Hello, I want  to  post  my  knowledge about magnetic motors and all
       this stuff about  free energy. I'm  a  student  from  the  technical
       university of West-Berlin, Germany, and I have spent  now  about six
       years, studying all kinds of free energy devices, which were claimed
       to work (over-unity-operation) from their inventors.

       At first we  had the claims from Mr. Bruce de Palma, from Montecito,
       Santa Barbara, California, who claimed,  his  "N-Machine" would have
       an efficiency about 140%, but the rotating speed of  his  device had
       been still too low and the frictional losses were still too high, so
       he couldn't prove the over-unity-operation.

       Here in Germany we also have an engineer, who had rebuilt many of de
       Palmas' N-Machines and  could only get about 105% efficiency. But he
       did a better measuring practice on his devices.

       105% seems to be still a measurement-error, but this German engineer
       still claims, he had done the measurement very precisely and I know,
       that he has a very good skill and had spent about 50.000 Dollars for
       measurement equipment.

       He also still believes, that there is still the possibility oà over-
       unity, but only about in the region  of  5 - 10 per cent. He claims,
       Bruce de Palma  had  made  some measurement errors  in  his  earlier
       devices, but there  is  still  something  mysterious  going on there
       inside the N-Machine. He does not  yet  know, which parameters could
       produce a bigger over-unity output.
                               --------------------
       Let's move to  Mr.  Joe  Newman,  from  Lucedale,  Mississippi,  who
       claimed about 3  -  5  years ago, that he had invented a new kind of
       energy machine, which was only some  kind  of  a rough dc-permanent-
       magnet-motor.

       His first machine  had  a copper coil with about 4500  kilograms  of
       weight and had a big permanent magnet rotating inside this coil.

       Additionally he had  a mechanical commutator to switch the direction
       of the current inside the coil fitted  to  the  permanent magnet. He
       powered this motor from dry-cell batteries and the mysterious effect
       was, that every time, the mechanical commutator switched,  there was
       a big current spike going back into the batteries.

       He and some other engineers claimed, that the energy inside this big
       current spike was bigger, than the energy fed into the device during
       the rest of the time.

       So what this  machine  was  claimed  to be doing, was recharging the
       batteries and still  outputting   mechanical   energy   through  the
       rotation of the magnet.

       The only problem was, that the power level of operation  was only in
       the range of  5  -  20  Watts  and that there was also a measurement
       problem, because when the commutator  switched  the  voltage  at the
       coil goes so high. (U = L*di/dt)


                                      Page 2





       Newman wanted to  get  a patent granted, but he failed and got crazy
       about it and in the end he disappeared  to  Mexico  with  his female
       secretary.

       I visited him in 1987 in Lucedale, Mississippi, where he also showed
       me his fan-motor, a new approach to bringing his technology  to  the
       market place. But  with  this small kind of his motor, the effect of
       the current spike  was  so  minimal,   that   the   batteries  still
       discharged.

       If there was  an  over-unity  effect  with  this  machine,  it  only
       appeared insidethe very  big  machines  of his design, but then this
       technology would only be available  for big power plants and not for
       a household central power unit.
                               --------------------

       But forget all  of  the  above  technology,  because   it   is   too
       complicated to build :

            Now here comes the breakthrough in free energy technology!

                               --------------------
       The machine is  called the Testatika and comes from the Methernitha-
       group from Linden, Switzerland, Europe.

       It runs totally on its own energy  and still produces about 3 KWATTs
       of free energy power !!!

       It is some  kind of an electrostatical WIMSHURST-Machine  and  still
       has some magnetic  devices  inside  its  design. So the normally low
       power WIMSHURST-Output is amplified  through  this magnetic unit and
       it maybe taps the everywhere present available background  radiation
       of the vacuum.

            Remember: the vacuum is not empty, it is full of energy !!!

       I have made  a computer an mation of the operation of this unit from
       digitized pictures of  this machine  from  a  videotape  Methernitha
       sells.

       If You all  want  to  look  at  this IBM-compatible demo  animation,
       please download from COMPUSERVE in the GRAPHSUPPORT- forum, download
       library 9 the file:  PERPET.LZH  (225 KBYTES).

       Please also read  the  included  ASCII-doc-file:  energy2.txt, which
       also has some information about a new kind of heat energy converter,
       which does a 100% conversion process  from heat to mechanical energy
       by violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics!

              (It is  not  a  law,  but  only concluded from  all  everyday
               experience; but  there are a few exceptions in nature, which
               do not respond to this "law",  like  for instance hurricanes
               and tornados, which get their mechanical rotation  energy by
               cooling down  the  surrounding  air and thus also converting
               heat energy to mechanical  output. We have already made some
               experiments, to prove that this is true.)

                          Believe or not, here it is !!!

       The first really  running  per€etuum mobile coming from Switzerland,
       Europe.

       These 2 demo-animations feature the so called : "TESTATIKA"-machine,
       which was developped over a 20 year  Research  period by a religious
       group called :
                                   METHERNITHA.

       This group lives  in CH-3517 Linden, Switzerland.  The  inventor  of
       this superb machine,  Mr.Paul  Baumann claims, its running principle 
       was found by studying the lightning effects from nature.

       And here are the facts :


                                      Page 4





       * Testatika is  an  influence-type  Wimshurst  machine which runs on
         it's own energy, once started by a counterclockwise spin given
         by revolving it's 2 disks by hand !!!

       * Testatika not only runs on it'  own  energy,  but  produces also a
         huge amount of excess power, at least 3 KWATTS of power !!!

               (That is enough to supply a one person appartment
                with one machine!  A modern home of approximately
                1500 Sq feet uses about 10 KWatts of power)

       * The machine You see during this demo-animation is only about 70 cm
         wide, 40 cm deep and about 60 cm tall !

       * It delivers  DC-Voltage  ranging  àrom  270 til  320  Volts,  only
         depending on  the  dryness  of  the  air!   At this voltage it can
         supply at least 10 Amperes of DC-current !

       * Testatika is not a perpetuum mobile,  but  an  energy machine that
         "sucks" it's  huge amount of "FREE" energy from  the  charged  and
         ionized air  particles.   But  there  are still some technological
         tricks implemented to overcome  the  normal  drag-resistance  of a
         conventional Wimhurst machine, which is still the  secret  of  the
         Methernitha group !!!

       Running the demo-animations:
       ----------------------------
       For viewing these 2 demos You need to have a VGA-card!!!

       To start one  of  the  two demo-animations of the TESTATIKA-machine,
       just type at the DOS-prompt:

         demo1  (RETURN)    or
         demo2  (RETURN)

       During the running of the animation,  adjust  Your  monitor  to  the
       right brightness and colors, so you can see all the details!

       Use the "+"  and "-" keys on the keypad to regulate  the  displaying
       speed!

       To end the demo press the "space" key a long time.

       Demo1 features :   Mr.  Paul  Baumann  lighting  a 500 Watt bulb fed
                         entirely by the  power  output of the self-running
                         Testatika machine while it is running!!!

       Demo2          :  shows  a  full blown image of a running  Testatika
                         machine!!!

              When will this technology be available for everyone ???
              -------------------------------------à-----------------

       The Testatika machines,  (there also exists some smaller units which
       only deliver about 200-300 Watts) are not yet mass-produced models !
       These are still laboratory prototype  units, although they are built
       with very good craftmansship !

       Also the group Methernitha doesn't want to put such a revolutionary

                                      Page 5





       unit into our materialistic world, where only money still counts!

       For to understand  their  basic  living  principles, I'll quote some
       sentences from a little book called:

                               WHAT IS METHERNITHA ?
                             ---------------------
       Quoted: "Methernitha is  a  rather  large  spiritual  community.  It
                cannot be  compared  with  a  sect  or a community  with  a
                personal religious opinion.  Methernitha is founded "In the
                Name of  God,  the  Almighty",  and is based on the Eternal
                Principles of the Holy Scripture.

       The word METHERNITHA is composed from  various  languages and stands
       as a Symbol for our own history. Each letter has a distinct meaning,
       which also depends  on its position within the word,  and  thus  the
       name METHERNITHA was formed.

       Above all, the  name  signifies  a certain Brotherhood of God, which
       was founded in the Heavenly Laws.  Only  he who practices God's Holy
       Commandments may learn    to   understand   the   fundamentals    of
       Methernitha's history properly."

                              Methernitha's high aim
                              ----------------------

       Methernitha was founded  to  allow  a  life in accordance with God's
       ancient Commandments for everyone seeking it. It's aim is to realize
       genuine humanity, which is the true  sense  of  life  and Aim of the
       Highest.

       The community is   formed  of  congenial  people.   In   their   own
       enterprises they earn  the  whole  financial  resources  to  make  a
       living. In some sense all members  are joint-owning partners of this
       selfsustaining co-operative.

       All members have equal rights and duties. Everybody  finds his place
       according to his  capabilities  and  knowledge. Through co-operative
       work Methernitha provides also material assistance to its members in
       time of distress, such as illness, old age, and other difficulties.

       There is no  obligation  for  contributions.   By   self-motivation,
       everyone must be  honestly and truly willing to serve  and  to  help
       and, through sincere    work,    diligence   and   conscientiousness
       contribute all one can to the fruitful realization of the principle:

                           "ONE FOR ALL  -  ALL FOR ONE"

       Alcohol, smokimg and all kinds of  worldly  amusements  are strictly
       forbidden.  Each member must seriously endeavour to really carry out
       God's Commandments in his daily life. The possibility  to  try  this
       way of life with us is open to everyone.

       With these explantions   we   have,   in   order   to  allow  better
       understanding, unveiled a few details of Methernitha.  Those wanting
       to learn more  about  works and knowledge  within  Methernitha,  are
       invited to get in contact with us.  However, for anyone  trying this
       for mere curiosity,  Methernitha  will  remain  but  an unfathomable
       mystery and a strange àountry.

       I personally have  visited  Methernitha  and  their living principle
       really works very well. Methernitha is like a big family.

       The 2 demo-animations come from a  video  tape Methernitha sells for
       180 Franken.  This tape also shows the other little machines running
       and explains Methernitha's spiritual aims.

       The tape has  a  running length of about 40 minutes  and  is  really
       worth looking at  it!  It is also available in VHS-NTSC and American
       language.

       It also shows Methernitha's earlier  research developments like huge
       wind generators, charging their big Battery-cell-station.

       With the Testatika there is no fraud, hidden batteries  or any other
       hidden energy source. It is really running !!!

              They already have the technology of ten years ahead!!!

       No more oil,  no  more  pollution, no more atomic waste  roducts, no
       more hunger in this world!

       This is the machine the mankind has dreamed about for centuries. Now
       it has come true !!!

       More information about the Methernitha  machine  is  also  available
       inside the german magazine RAUM & ZEIT, issue Nr.40, 8.Jahrgang from
       Ehlers Verlag, Daimlerstrasse 5, D-8029 Sauerbach, Germany.

       More good news about a NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGY:
       ---------------------------------------------

       The Workshop of  Decentral  Energy  Research  e.V.,   West   Berlin,
       Germany, proudly presents  a  new circular process, which defies the
       2nd Law of Thermodynamics and converts  heat  energy on a 100% level
       into mechanical work!

       That means, that  we have found a way to cool down  a  reservoir  of
       heat a few  degrees and to get mechanical work (or electrical energy
       converted with an electrical generator  from  the mechanical output)
       out of it !

       That means, it is possible to build a self-running  refrigerator  or
       e.g. to build a new boat propelling machine which gets its energy by
       cooling down the seawater by a few degrees!!!

       This invention was  made  by  Bernhard  Schaeffer,  a Thermodynamics
       expert, who did'nt want to believe  for 25 years that the 2nd Law of
       Thermodynamics is true for all cases in nature.

       So he began his own research program which led him  to  the Austrian
       inventor and physician  Dr.  Ing.  Rudolf Docezekal, who already had
       shown in 1940 that such a circular process exists, but his ideas

                                      Page 7





       were almost forgotten,  if  Bernhard  Schaeffer  had  not found them
       again !!!

       The NEW Circular Process which converts  heat  into  100% mechanical
       energy uses :

       A mixture of Benzol - (C6H6) and water - (H2O) steam  is  heated  at
       147 degrees Celsius.  If  one  measures now a pressure versus volume
       diagram one will get new results  showing  that  the  2 medium steam
       mixtures behave totally different than the normally  examined single
       medium steam.

       So with this circular process using Benzol - and Water-Steam one can
       get a bigger  clockwise rotating area than the counterclockwise area
       of the pressure versus volume diagramm.

       That means, Bernhard Schaeffer has  invented  a  heat-power  machine
       with a "no cold pole".

       In this machine type the heat doesn't flow from the  hot pole to the
       cold pole like  in  conventional heat-power motors (like in Stirling
       machines) but is simply converted to mechanical power output !!!

       Because there is no cold pole with  this  new  type  of  machine you
       can't also use  the Carnot equation to calculate the  efficiency  of
       the circular process.   With this Benzol-Water circular process it's
       every time 100% !!!

           (This might sound a little too technical for some people:
            If You are not a physics freak  and haven't yet heard about the
            Laws of Thermo-dynamics then please copy this  demo to a friend
            who studies physics and tell many people about it! It's time to
            end the pollution on our planet!)

       The Benzol-Water process  is  currently  only working at 147 degrees
       Celsius.  But there are also other  steam  mixtures  available which
       might work in  another  temperature  range, like  0  to  20  degrees
       Celsius, which would  make it possible to cool down the air on a hot
       summer day and to build a self-running air-conditioning system which
       still produces electrical output-power as a byproduct!

           What a great future for clean unpolluting energy production !

       A working model  of the Benzol-Water-steam  energy-machine  will  be
       built soon, and  presented  to the public, when the  computer  aided
       maximization of the circular process has been completed.
