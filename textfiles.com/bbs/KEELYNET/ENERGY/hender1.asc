For some years scientists have voiced opinions concerning the nature of the
next great break-through in science and have suggested methods by which new
discoveries can be made. One suggestion, made at a science symposium was, in
essence; we have looked for the answer by looking deep into matter, even
beyond the atom. This approach has not resulted in the break-through desired.

Another possible approach is to do experiments and observe the results in
order to shed some light on the nature of that which we desire to understand.

This book is not intended as a complete revelation into the nature of the
universe we live in. It is, however an humble attempt to describe experiments
done and evaluated along with an extended basic theory, broad enough to
encompass the results observed and the supporting evidence presented.

The author has lectured on his findings and theories to many groups of
diversified interests and vocations, and this book is to fulfill the many
requests made, especially by the young people, so that they can study the
thoughts presented.

A REVEALING EXPERIENCE

This book is prompted because of the author's desire to share his experiences
and the results of his studies. Some years ago he was involved in a science
experiment which proved to him beyond a doubt that an unlimited energy source
does exist and that it can be tapped.

He has postulated a basic theory to explain this energy and he feels that he
is on solid ground in taking a stand to reevaluate and extend certain basic
theories in use today. He feels this because, in addition to many years of
private study and research, he was involved in experiments with Lester
Hendershot in building, operating and evaluating certain devices which
generated electricity in usable form, but with no loss to any of its parts and
without the use of fuel of any type. This period of experimentation started in
the year 1958 and lasted for 2-1/2 years.

Lester Hendershot first demonstrated a small device in the late 1920's.
Stories and pictures were published in the New York Times and in other papers
at that time. He reasoned that through his device he was tapping the earth's
magnetic field and deriving electricity from it.

The author, because of his keen interest in magnetism and related subjects,
checked into the Hendershot story and other stories which rumor described as
having generated usable electricity by unorthodox methods. Although there were
some frauds and perpetuators of wild tales, nevertheless findings showed him
that most of these demonstrations appeared to prove their authenticity and
lack of any fraud on the part of the conceiver; still interest and involvement
by science in general was lacking even after they observed the demonstrations.
This because there was no known theory by which power could be demonstrated
without either the use of fuel or an exchange of energy from one form to
another.

Curiosity and diligent pursuit had its reward to the author, and he located
Lester Hendershot in the city of Cypress, California. Mr. Hendershot had for
some 20 years been inactive in his research but in the past few years he had
demonstrated, on a limited scale, a much larger device than in his early days.

However, when we first met, Mr. Hendershot was confined to a wheel chair due
to an industrial accident and at that time had no operating device. The last
one he had made was taken by an interested industrialist from New York and a
California engineer for evaluation of its construction and parts.

This was the beginning of 2-1/2 years of wonderful but frustrating research.
Frustrating because it was difficult to find common ground upon which the many
interested and involved persons could agree. This because of their diversified
interests and opinions. This device was a new experience to each and no one
knew the method or the reason for its successful operation.

Lester Hendershot wanted to leave to the world something of great value. Using
his simple device to light conventional light bulbs, operate TV, radio, and
small motors, he could not doubt its reality; but neither could he explain its
power when operating or why so often it would not operate at all. Interested
associates and advisers wanted to believe that here in this device was a
multimillion dollar invention nearly ready for marketing.

As no device was available for the author to observe in operation to fulfill
his great desire, one had to be constructed. Using instructions from Lester
Hendershot, he painstakingly, without a model and with only limited
specifications, constructed the first of five devices, which consisted of
basket weave coils, electrolytic condensers, small transformers, a permanent
magnet, 2 bell ringing coils and one hand wound electrolytic condenser.

After seeing his first inanimate device come to life under the influence of
Lester Hendershot, the author knew beyond a doubt that here was in part the
nature of the next great break-through in science; and that limits based on
studies of exchange of energy and/or quantum mechanics did not indeed exist.

What did exist was the problem of how to get Lester Hendershot and associates
to realize the magnitude of what was demonstrated and how to get cooperation
of science, which was necessarily skeptical that anything of value could come
from limited scientific background.

During 1960 two arranged demonstrations to top electronic engineering groups
were canceled because of fear of revelation of an invention. However, in mid-
April 1961, Lester Hendershot finally agreed to go all out in revealing every
detail of both construction and operation of his device in an environment
including men of science and the equipment needed to evaluate in detail the
nature of the power generated by the device, and how this was brought about.
However, Lester Hendershot passed away very suddenly on April 26, 1961, thus
bringing to a close that phase of this project.

The author had, and still has, in his possession the last device which he had
constructed. However this device is only so much material without the
influence of Lester Hendershot -- whatever that may be --- and the device does
not operate.

There were several variations of the Hendershot device, and all of them
operated. The device that the author made was a simple two-bank unit employing
two sets of electrolytic condensers. The two negative banks were all hooked
together in a common ground.

The positive sides were each hooked to a unique arrangement of three basket
weave coils within a single unit, which was 6" in diameter by 3" high.

Fitting closely to the inner circumference of this triple coil was a condenser
which was rewound from an 80 mfd, 400 volt electrolytic condenser, but dried
before winding on a metal ring. The final capacitance was not critical. Units
operated anywhere from 0.006 mfd to 40 mfd, but they were critical as to
balance.  Each side had to be within less than 2% in value to the other.

Two small transformers were also used in the basket weave coil circuit, but
value was not critical. The device also employed a large permanent magnet
opposing two bell ringing coils which in turn were wired to the two banks.

This arrangement appeared to act similar to a pacer, as the magnet acted as a
cushion to the bell coil circuits when they became activated. There were
variations in capacitance, in inductance and even in circuit wiring, which all
proved that the mystery of operation did not depend on a certain, exact type
of device.

Descriptions of other devices by other individuals show a broad detail of
mechanical construction, but all had two things in common:

     (1) they did generate electricity without the use of fuel or of loss to
         any of its parts and
     (2) there was an operator who used individualized methods to trigger the
         device into operation.

John W. Keely, who demonstrated such a device for many years, is described in
The Books of Chas Fort. In personal notes, which were available in Los
Angeles, he stated this concerning his personal works, "I had thought that I
could bring to the world a new source of power, but now, at this late date, I
find that there is a personal influence involved which I cannot overcome".
This statement was made in reference to starting his devices.

In the early stages of experiments with the Hendershot device, it seemed at
times that the easy way out was to deny that which was observed because it did
not fit our accepted theories. This despite the fact that there was no fraud
or attempt at fraud. However, it became increasingly difficult to deny
something observed and the result was to pursue it further, questioning the
lack of understanding rather than the reality of that observed and
experienced.

After over a year of experimenting with Lester Hendershot, it became apparent
that this device was better described as a living, mechanical body, caged or
geared into a force outside of itself. Its operation paralleled the relation
of a windmill to the wind. Its becoming a living thing in space depended on a
factor similar to that of a doctor massaging a heart that had stopped, or in
triggering this heart with a pacer.

This idea seemed at first too far-fetched to warrant further consideration,
but became more acceptable after observing and evaluating a characteristic
common to all units (devices) made by us and also reviewing records or
statements concerning other devices and demonstrations in the past.

When a device, which was not in operation, was first started by Lester
Hendershot the homemade condenser, which seemed to act as antennas, would pick
up voltage pressure slowly at first and then faster.  Following this the main
condensers would do likewise, followed by a near 60 cycle pulse, which could
be heard as a loud hum on the magnet and coil circuit. This pulse would surge
from one bank to the other. At the peak of surge into the condensers, an added
surge of power was visible on the scope pattern. The voltage now across the
load would be anywhere from 90 to 140 volts A.C. depending on the model used.

The near 60 cycle oscillation was common to all units. On one unit a slight
unbalance of the homemade condenser was compensated for by squeezing a soft
spot on one condenser. After Lester Hendershot had started the device by
squeezing it, his hand tired, so he turned it over to the author. A firm
squeeze again started the output and you may be assured that it was a thrill
to hold this pulsing condenser. It was a feeling of holding the pulse of the
living universe manifesting itself in a machine, even as in a living body.

BASIC THEORIES

The mechanics of cause and operation of the physical universe is kinetic
energy (energy in motion).

Atomic structure is fluid space in physical form.

The atom is a manifestation and is both positive and negative in character;
therefore, space also has two basic properties that is, positive and negative.
These properties are in the form of constants. One, which is recognized and
used, has a speed of 18 6,000 mi./sec. It is primary light energy, positive in
polarity and male in gender. The other constant has a speed of 202,000
mi./sec. It is also a primary light energy, negative in polarity and female in
gender. These constants have density and motion and they are equal. The
positive is more dense and slower in motion, while the negative is less dense
and faster in motion.

The structure of undistorted space is square and linear (uniform throughout)
and the constants move at a 90 degree angle to each other. They are insulated
one from the other by intelligent space which has no motion, but is one
everywhere. If it were in motion it could not either insulate or control.

The universe is also a universe of frequencies (broad band of frequencies).
Each element is a frequency occupying a band width of space. Groups or
combinations of elements can, as a unit, cover a broader band width of space.

For example, paramagnetic material or magnetism covers a certain band width of
space.

Atom energy, or any other energy derived from changing the form or state of
physical material, is energy taken from atomic structure. With an expanded
theory approach it is possible to tap energy in abundance from the driver of
the atom (space energy) without taking it from atomic structure.

Atomic power with its penalty of contamination is not necessary as the basic
atomic energy can be tapped before it is material substance. Then there are no
contaminations or harmful side effects, because nothing is destroyed and
because the energy is only used, even as the wind is used by the windmill.

MAGNETISM

Magnetism is a distortion of space, a distortion within the atomic structure
of the magnet material which extends into the space surrounding it. To explain
this statement let us consider our most common kind of magnet, the alnico
magnet, when made from an alloy of aluminum, copper, nickel, iron and cobalt.

Each of these elements have different properties and different reactions to
the process of manufacture. Now, let us follow the making of a magnet.

First, a bar of alnico alloy is placed in an oven and held in a semi-flux
state, the oven having a directional field within it which aligns the
molecular structure within the alloy, parallel and directional. The alloy is
then cooled very slowly.

At this time it is hard and brittle and it cannot be filed or sawed, but it is
not yet a magnet. It is linear, even as undistorted space is linear. And now
the alloy is ready to be 'charged', and at this point we question the use of
the word 'charged' when used in describing the activating of a magnet.

Rather we would reason thus: This slowly cooled, linear mass which is
physically hard, must still in all its individual properties follow the laws
of contraction and expansion common to each element which it contains. Nickel,
when placed in a strong magnetic field shrinks, while iron and cobalt both
expand, but at different rates. The copper and aluminum are merely good
conductors and alloying agents.

Now these elements are locked in a hard mass (the alloy) but the nickel must
shrink while the iron and cobalt must expand, therefore this contraction and
expansion in opposition to each other, becomes a distortion within the atomic
structure of the elements.

And now we have an activated, permanent magnet. Two opposite poles exist, N
pole and S pole, which are related to the two space constants previously
mentioned. The atomic structure of the magnet being energy, it extends its
distortion to the energy-space surrounding it.

As an illustration, we consider a undistorted area of space before us. We move
an activated magnet into this area of space and the result is that this
previously undistorted and linear space is now distorted and nonlinear. That
is, two poles exist in relation to the magnet; a N pole and a S pole.

At the N pole we have a lack of S pole and at the S pole we have a lack of N
pole. Or, at each end of the magnet, we have a lack of balanced space. In
other words, distorted space, (a low pressure area) now exists at each pole.

Any non-polarized material within the band width of magnetism and electricity
(a paramagnetic material) will migrate to the low pressure area at either
pole, while a polarized object (another magnet) will demonstrate the law of
opposites attracting and similars repelling each other.

This is brought about by opposite poles balancing that area of space and
moving the unbalance along its length, whereas similar poles bring to that
area of space an excess of that quality and, therefore, create, an unbalance
(opposite to lack).

The above theory of expansion and/or contraction holds true as cause of
magnetism in all types of permanent magnets, including ceramic magnets and
also bismuth and maganese magnets, (as was demonstrated by a Navy research
team. Bismuth, though being a dismagnetic material has good properties of
change when electric current is passed through it).

A mechanical magnet, brought about by compression of materials will be
described in the following chapter.

BLOOD STREAM

Reflect back to the experiments with Lester Hendershot, when we stated that
the device became a living thing. A living physical body and the device have
one major characteristic in common, namely pulsation. Consider the physical
body of man. We know that should his arms and legs be held, he could still
squirm; should he be choked, he could still struggle for awhile; but should
the pulsation of his blood stream be stopped, all resistance stops
immediately. The pulsation of the blood stream is life and power.

The above was also true of the Hendershot device, except it operated in the
band width of electricity and magnetism. The pulsation was necessary to
generate usable amounts of electricity.

A condenser in electronics is similar in one basic respect to the blood stream
of man. The veins and arteries are separated by tissues, even as in a
condenser the positive and negative are separated by insulation. Analyzing
this a bit further, we consider a small battery made of silver (an old dime)
and a piece of aluminum foil separated by damp paper. The flow of current will
average up to 1 milliampere.  Now use a bit of salt along with the water and
the current flow will increase up to 5 times what it was.

Before the era of modern drugs, a common practice as an emergency first aid
measure, was to feed a saline solution into the blood stream. This shows a
possible reaction by both a battery and a body to the same outside force.

In the Hendershot device, the surge of current passing through a load such as
a light bulb, would lose some energy to the load, then continue on to the
opposite bank of condensers. These condensers, at this moment of surge showed
gain. The surge back towards the otherside was now stronger than the incoming
surge had been. Space energy in motion in the area occupied by the condensers,
is absorbed by the condensers during and because of the pulse, compression or
strain.

At a Science Fair in San Francisco, a mechanical magnet was demonstrated. A
cylindrical mass, composed mostly of lead property material, combined also a
mechanical vise capable of compressing and shortening physically this
cylinder, and then, suddenly releasing the tension created. The result when
tension was released was a spark, similar to an ignition system spark jumping
the gap.

Here we see a distortion of linearity brought about by physical means, thus
creating a field that collapses when the strain is released. This can be
described as a pulse.

To explain this power, we either have to give mysterious power to the
materials involved, or state that kinetic energy was absorbed by a certain,
characteristic pulse.

Now we again reflect on the blood steam and observe that in running up a hill,
more power is needed and that the blood stream pulsates harder in answer to
the demand.

Now supposing that rather than looking for mysterious ratchets or other
mechanical contrivances within the muscles (atomic structure), and simply
state that atomic substance, being energy, can contract and expand. The brain
is the controller of this motion.

The power used for this motion is space energy. This energy comes directly
from the space energy in motion, which is passing through the body at all
times, and is captured by the pulsation of the crystalline structure of the
blood stream.

By this theory we would say that food which we eat does not directly give us
energy and heat, but rather acts, in essence, to the body of man as does
sulphuric acid to a battery. That is; food to the body of man, and acid to the
battery makes it possible to take a charge, or to accept and/or use energy.

At this point we reflect on the flight of a humming bird. It takes a great
deal of energy to move the wings as rapidly as does this remarkable bird. Some
species migrate, non-stop, for great distances even over water. The capacity
of humming bird's body for storage of food for power would call for a very
efficient system to produce the power needed to beat the wings so rapidly, for
so long a time, however, if the food acts as a space-catalyst only, and the
pulsation of the body, taps the energy directly from space, then no problem is
encountered.

In summation we say that all bodies in space are born from space and derive
their power for motion, both directly and indirectly from space energy, and
that devices such as the Hendershot and others which have not been
investigated by science because of being 'too far out', do have a logical
basis for operation, which is similar even to the physical body, except
working only in the bandwidth of magnetism and electricity.

AUTO IGNITION SYSTEM

Now let us consider an auto ignition system consisting of a timer, a coil and
a condenser. The question often asked concerning the auto ignition is: Why
does the spark jump the spark gap when the ignition points break contact;
rather than when current is applied through the closed points of the system?
The answer usually given is that a collapsing field is faster than a building
field, which in effect dumps accumulated capacitance quickly.

For a broader analysis of this collapsing field we again use our linear space
theory. We picture the area of space occupied by an unactiviated coil (switch
off and no motion of the timer). We visualize this space as occupied by a very
large number of rubber bands stretched tight (linear space).

We can consider them as positive in one direction and negative the other at a
90 degrees angle to the positive. We now circulate electricity through the
closed points.  Current flow through the coil brings about an electromagnetic
field, creating a distortion as done by a permanent magnet (it has N and S
poles).

In theory we would now observe the rubber bands representing linear space and
note that a portion of the rubber bands (or that portion of energy-space
representing the band width of electricity and magnetism) have now been pushed
in opposite directions by the field we created by the activated coil;
(distorted space) the negative moving to the negative and the positive moving
to the positive.  If we could observe this action of bending, we would see a
quick action of bending at first, slowing when pressure of the coil fields
became less effective due to expansion and tension of the opposing bands
outward.

We now break the contact points of the distributor or timer and remove the
field created by the coil. The so-called collapsing field could now be
described as space returning back to linearity with a slap. That is the
positive and the negative closing in from opposite directions and filling a
rapidly diminishing area and then suddenly coming together; perhaps even
bringing about a slight crossing of bands, or a short circuit of electric
space which would be like a miniature bolt of lightning.

The small condenser in the circuit adds to the intensity of the spark across
the spark plug gap by becoming an accumulator of energy when placed under
strain of a sudden surge or pulse (at that moment absorbing energy from
space). This was further explained in relating my experience with Lester
Hendershot and a device that generated electricity without loss to any of its
parts and without the use of fuel.

POWER BLACKOUTS AND STALLED ENGINES

During the last few years we have experienced or heard of large scale failure
of electric power transmission systems. A typical power failure was one
involving Mesa, Arizona and a large surrounding area. This blackout was of
about 3 hours duration and during this time the cause was not found in
mechanical failure. The system came back to normal without repairs, nor was
there any reported cause of the failure.

The large power failure (blackout) in New York was described by the attendants
as starting with a large surge of current in one direction, as though a direct
short circuit existed, then within a short time, the flow reversed with no
apparent cause. A long power blackout resulted and the cause was not
satisfactorily explained. Even a major transmission line disaster would not
have caused the blackout as it was experienced.

Apply the space energy theory to the power failures. We analyze thus: A high
voltage power line has a lesser loss during transmission from point to point
than does a lower voltage power line. An alternating current power line has a
lesser loss than a direct current power line.

All power lines have a field surrounding the wire, brought about by motion of
current along the wire.  Alternating current has a pulsating motion and is
more active than direct current, therefore it has a stronger field surround
ing the wire. Therefore:  high voltage alternating current, having a strong
field around the wire, is used for long distant power transmission.

Research is being done on direct current power transmission, however, this too
will be in very high voltages. The fields around the wire are protection to
the system to maintain a lack of electrons. This lack is the characteristic of
a positive terminal. A negative terminal has an excess of electrons.

Space also has electrons, or a bandwidth of electricity, Lightning
demonstrates this quality of space. Now should the field surrounding the power
line break down, then electricity from space could supply the lack of
electrons, and would in effect be a short circuit --- satisfying the lack
without going through the load and supplying power.

Lack of electrons is measured in voltage. Complete satisfaction of electron
lack is loss of voltage, or would in effect be a blackout. Reports of strange
lights in the area of power lines during blackouts has been generally ignored.

But considering the possibility, as outlined, of a complete loss of power
being possible without visible or physical damage to the system, strange
phenomena should not be ignored as a possible cause when based on the theory
of space being able to supply electricity to a power line when minus its
field.

It is a bit difficult to visualize a strong field from a natural cause, other
than perhaps a disturbance in the energy realms, having a strong concentration
of electricity and motion, perhaps in the form of a vortex (whirlpool) strong
enough to overcome the powerline field and open a pathway for electrons.

We cannot overlook similar failures on a smaller scale reported many times in
many parts of the world. For instance in Texas during the reported space
flight of the Russian dog, several autos came to a halt because of a strange
craft landing alongside the highway. They could not move again until the
strange craft left the area.

Other reports tie this to electrical failure because radios, electric starters
and apparently ignition systems ceased to function. Trucks using diesel
engines with no electrical ignition used for engine operation performed as
usual.

Reviewing ignition systems as described previously, we note the necessity of a
space field bending and collapsing as part of its operation. Then a strong
field related to space could well distort the area for a distance, enveloping
the systems of the autos and making them inoperative.

Power transmission systems could fall victim to similar disturbances and
operate as usual when the disturbance leaves the area.

THRESHER

When the nuclear sub, Thresher, During a depth test dive, going deeper than it
had ever done before, met sudden disaster, the question asked by all concerned
was 'Why?'.

It was stated in the news releases, which quoted nuclear physics scientists,
that nothing could have happened to the atomic reactor which would have caused
the tragedy. This statement was based on the accepted atomic theory that the
power derived from the atom is from the properties of the atom which are
wholly contained within it (in the form of storage).

If this theory were true, then the depth of the reactor in the water would
have no bearing on its operation, and it would operate safely at any depth
which the structure of the sub would allow. A garbled message from the
Thresher indicated the need to surface immediately and that the trouble
encountered had happened suddenly and was not quickly explainable.

Now, based on by experience in evaluating the Hendershot device the statement
that nothing could happen to the reactor was quickly questioned, and during
the evening of the tragedy, the following reasoning was aired: If an atom is
born from space and is still a product of space, then changing its level of
potential is best described as a short circuit of space. The reactor, built
and tested on the surface, would get neutralization from space, even as
lightning being a product of space finds neutralization.

When this reactor was insulated from space by a thick layer of water, a lack
of --- should we say atomic balance began to build. When this lack became
great enough to extend to surrounding material - great enough a lack to
overcome the ability of that structure to hold all of its own properties
intact, a reaction, parallel to high voltage drawing electrons through space,
took place. But this was an action in atomic substance rather than electrons.

The result would be a weakening of the surrounding structure, due to loss of
some of its natural properties. The concluding statement made that evening
was, 'If this evaluation is reasonably correct then debris floating to the
surface will show evidence of unnatural decay in the form of holes and marks.
It could be in appearance described as a sudden flash fire. electronic in
nature.'

A close watch of newspapers concerning reports, especially of the debris was
rewarded by finding in the Los Angeles Herald Examiner an article describing
gloves and plastics surrounding the reactor. This plastic material was
described as having pinholes and pock marks and that a sudden flash fire
seemed to have taken place.

This test of a theory shows added evidence that the atomic theory limiting
atom potential to storage of energy alone, needs to be reevaluated and
broadened.

TRANSMITTED SIGNALS

An analogy often used to describe a transmitted signal such as TV or radio
signals, is to depict a smooth surface of a lake and a pebble dropped into it
creating a disturbance or waves, as being similar to a transmitted signal.
The speed of travel is ignored in this analogy. The wave motion or signal
travels from the source and secondary waves are placed in motion by
obstructions encountered. This is referred to as bounce, and is often referred
to as cause of ghosts on TV screens.

In applying the linear space theory to a transmitted TV or radio signal,
rather than using the analogy that the transmitted signal somewhat resembles a
wave traveling across a body of water, we picture this body of water to be a
body of jello-like substance, very light in weight, which when jiggled at one
spot moves as a body; the motion diminishing in proportion to the distance and
area covered. This is seemingly more true in atmosphere space than in outer
space.

To complete the analogy, we add two more characteristics to the jello-like
nature of space; (1) the ability to bend and (2) the ability to compress at 90
degrees to the direction of movement from the transmitter. The transmitted
signal is a forth and back motion; this will have a longer movement for low
frequencies and a shorter movement for high frequencies.

To describe the compression of the signal, we evaluate the surface of the
earth as a negative polarity, compared to space above the surface as positive
polarity. The strength of attraction or compression depends on the structure
of the surface.  Rocky ground, mass rock concentration or rock formations have
the best compression effect, perhaps due to the frequency of the structure
being in harmonics with the signal frequency.

For instance different types of rock will effect different TV channels. Well
watered ground is generally better than dry ground of the same type. In
various areas of clay structure only low frequency TV channels are received.

Now picture a submerged island in the jello lake and visualize a low frequency
of long movement and note that there can be motion of the substance at the
opposite side from the transmitter, due to bending. In an extreme case the
motion can be from 180 degrees or the opposite direction; this again due to
the bend making a half circle, rather than being a bounce from a distant
point.

High frequency or short jiggles would not have the ability to bend as
effectively due to short duration of the pulse, therefore an ultra high
frequency could not be received where a lower frequency could.

A local area, thoroughly checked for Los Angeles TV channels, show that very
rocky ground area in the foothills, far removed from line of sight, enjoy fair
to excellent TV reception on VHF channels. Areas with much better line of
sight conditions, but with farm land receive the lower channels (2-6) from
poorly to fair and the high channels (7-13) from unusable to marginal. One
area of mica schist is also good in spite of no line of sight. A good granite
rock outcropping will show a compressed (or better) signal immediately above
the rock than when moving away from it.

Ghosts observed on a TV screen correspond to mountain passes observed on the
skyline between the transmitters and the reception area. The distance from the
source being slightly longer or shorter via different passes, they arrive at a
slightly different time, resulting in two or more images on the TV screen, and
are not necessarily the result of a bounce.

Now we evaluate the return of a signal, described as being bounced from an
object in outer space. By theorizing that space has density and pressure, the
jello-like motion of a transmitted signal would effect the substance of the
body in space by producing a slight motion of its atomic structure, and in
effect, make a transmitter of the body, returning the signal at an 180 degree
phase shift.

The reason for this long discourse is to further evaluate the theory of space
having density, pressure and motion.

ANTIMATTER

It is difficult, if not almost impossible to describe in physical terms that
which, though real is microscopic, therefore to discuss the world of
antimatter we look to a macroscopic (macrocosm) as a parallel. First we
recognize that a galaxy is shaped like a shallow dish. An unbalanced shape
does not seem to belong so we draw another shallow dish opposing it, bottoms
towards each other.

We now recognize an equator between the two and draw lines to the poles to
represent circulation of a galaxy. Now observing the two dish shaped bodies,
one visible and the other invisible to the physical eye, we use this drawing
to describe antimatter. Every particle has an opposite, therefore, any point
on one side has its opposite on the other.

The universe is a universe of tension brought about by division and expansion,
but which is still one, therefore when antimatter is united it ceases to be in
opposition form and reverts to pure energy. There is no basic particle but
every particle has an opposite. Dealing in matter on one side only, we have a
difference of energy levels between different units of matter. Dealing in
antimatter we are dealing with the whole single unit.

This is a sketch showing a parallel of antimatter and a galaxy.

A report in the Los Angeles Examiner quoting a survey of observable motion in
the vicinity of a galaxy showed this motion as illustrated by the arrows and
in relation to side A.

The antimatter world is recognized as existing in matter in opposite form,
this illustration of a galaxy would seem incomplete without adding Side B.

GRAVITY

Gravity is akin to magnetism but covers a broader band width of space. During
space probes and observations it has been noted that the outer perimeter of
the earth's gravity field is about 200,000 miles beyond the moon and resembles
a large ball with a tail like a comet. It is in motion as is the planet within
it.

Now supposing we consider gravity as a pressure from without rather than an
attraction from within and reason thus: First we evaluate a superheterodyne
radio or that portion of radio or TV which uses an intermediate frequency
(I.F.) stage. This intermediate frequency is brought about by beating an
incoming signal (which is a frequency) with an oscillator frequency, thus
creating the third frequency or I.F. This demonstrates that energy in form is
real or tangible to other energy. Thus physical substance being energy in form
would react to differentials of pressures encountered and tend to move toward
a low pressure area.

Now supposing we give space beyond the earth's field an arbitrary pressure of
100, and in relation to this we would give the very center of the earth a
pressure of O. We now have in theory a varying pressure field with low point
of pressure towards its center.

Any energy such as atomic structure would tend to move toward the low pressure
area, the denser atoms giving greater resistance than those less dense, which
differences would be measured as differences in weight. The band width of
gravity covers all materials common to earth including its atmosphere.

At this point it may be well to reflect on the action or effect of our moon
upon the water masses of earth (the tides). Any body in motion in space has a
field. The moon’s field creating a slight change of pressure of the earth's
field at its point of passing. Large bodies of water thus effected would move
gently, reflecting the change of pressure upon them brought about by the
moon's passing.

When 2 large balls are suspended by long chains and hung close together, they
tend to move towards each other. This is said to prove that gravity is an
attraction of mass upon mass. This conclusion could be questioned by
presenting a theory of space having density and motion. The area occupied by
the balls was linear, undistorted space before the balls were placed there.
The presence of the balls altered this linearity due to their close proximity
to each other, thus creating a slightly lesser pressure on the sides adjacent
than on the unobstructed outer circumference of the balls.

NOT A BIG BANG

Men in science are evaluating more and more the nature of the universe in
which we live. Their discoveries are developing a pattern which takes in a
broader scope than earth and its physical nature. There has been much
discussion concerning two basic possibilities describing the beginning of the
universe. Namely, a growing universe and a 'big bang' theory. The big bang
theory describes a large mass suddenly blowing apart and moving into space.
This theory is hard to visualize or accept as we immediately ask, 'Where did
the mass that blew apart come from in the first place?'  Obviously if the mass
existed, it was not the beginning.

The universe operates in a very orderly and intelligent manner. Therefore, its
beginning must also have been orderly and intelligent. It is fascinating to
think of this beginning as parallel to the nature of physical growth, that is
through cell division.  But rather than limit the universe to only the
physical, we will consider it as an expansion of a duality.

It is difficult to describe an indescribable event with our limited terms and
conceptions, even as an atom in one's toe would find it difficult to describe
the body of which it is a part and then beyond that a planet, a solar system,
a galaxy, etc. But here is a try.

If at first all that was, was singular, but desiring expression, then this
singular would choose to divide into two opposites. These opposites then still
being one, were a trinity; positive, negative and the attraction one for the
other (or in gender male, female and attraction). This division was repeated
until an alphabet of many divisions and combinations existed.

This division could then be described as intelligent energy filling space
surrounding it. And it is possible, and even likely that this creation is
still going on.

Now to reflect on material substance, we analyze a tree. We see a tree below
the ground and a tree above the ground in a negative, positive polarized unit.
We now evaluate the structure and note the grain, then the molecules, then the
atomic structure as energy. We now theorize that the tree is manifested from
energy.

Going back to a universe of controlled intelligent energy, which creates a
parallel universe of: First, energy in motion; Second, atoms; and lastly a
physical universe. As this expansion took place in both forms, non-physical
and physical, there was more and more room for expression. This expression can
well be individualized to the idea that we, as individuals, are individualized
expressions of the whole.

An expanding universe as described, would have an attraction towards its
center along with the expansion outward, therefore it could be described as a
universe of tension. If the two opposites are united, they cease to be in
tension form and have, in neutralizing, demonstrated a release of energy.

We note evolution and desire for better expression as a characteristic even in
individual man. Evolution and change is universal, even in the two realms,
physical and Cause-of-physical. The Physical theory is basically correct, but
is only a parallel, or one side of evolution, which is the physical side
effect not the cause.

CONCLUSION

Man's abundance and scope of operation is far beyond his wildest dreams. When
he learns to better understand the nature of the space he lives in, his food
supply, fuel for travel, light and heat will be as unlimited as is
demonstrated by the motions and powers of the universe.

The stretches of space are, in essence, a vast sea of energy and motion having
the property of a vast energy field, even as demonstrated on a small scale by
a field coil of an electric motor. To a properly designed craft, employing an
unbalanced field, this space is a pathway to the stars --- as well as a
pathway in the energy atmosphere of this planet. Even food used on distant
trips can be grown, as the building blocks and polarities needed for food are
everywhere available.

The essential requisites are understanding, a desire to know and suppression
of an inflated ego, demanding self aggrandizement. Man's greatest opportunity
to knowing is to put less emphasis on memorizing the changing opinions of
others and, instead, saying 'I will find out', rather than, 'I do not know'.
When man says, 'I do not know', he closes the door by showing disinterest.
When he says, 'I will find out', he opens the door to all the knowledge that
is, to the extent of his ability to comprehend.

It is his rightful heritage to know, but he must have the desire and he must
open the door......
