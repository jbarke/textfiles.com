                   Quantum Fluctuations of Empty Space :
                      A New Rosetta Stone of Physics?

    In a recent  article  in the popular press (The Economist, January
    7, 1989, pp. 71-74) it was noted  how  many  of this century's new
    technologies depend on the Alice-in-Wonderland physics  of quantum
    mechanics, with all of its seeming absurdities.

    For starters, one  begins  with  the  observation  that  classical
    physics tells us that atoms, which  can  be likened to a miniature
    solar system with electron planets orbiting a nuclear  sun, should
    not exist.

    The circling electrons  should  radiate  away  their  energy  like
    microscopic radio antennas and spiral into the nucleus.  But atoms
    do exist, and multitudinous other  phenomena  which don't obey the
    rules do occur.

    To resolve this cognitive dissonance physicists introduced quantum
    mechanics, which is  essentially  a set of mathematical  rules  to
    describe what in  fact  does  happen.   But  when  we  re-ask  the
    question, "why didn't the electron  radiate  away its energy?" the
    answer is, basically, "well, in quantum theory it doesn't."

    It's at this  point that not only the layman but  some  physicists
    can begin to  feel  that  someone's  not playing fair.  I say only
    some physicists because the majority  of  working  physicists  are
    content simply to use quantum rules that work, that  describe  (if
    only statistically) what  will  happen in a given experiment under
    certain conditions.

    These are the   so-called  "logical   positivists"   who,   in   a
    philosophical sense, are  like  the  news  reporter   whose   only
    interest is the bottom line.

    There are nevertheless  individuals  here and there who still want
    to know why the electron didn't radiate,  why Einstein's equations
    are in this form and not another, where does the  ubiquitous zero-
    point energy that  fills  even  empty space come from, why quantum
    theory, and perhaps the biggest  question  of  all,  how  did  the
    universe get started anyway?


                                  Page 1
    Surprisingly enough, there  may  be  answers  to  these  seemingly
    unanswerable meta-level questions.   Perhaps even more surprising,
    they seem to  be  emerging, as a recent book title  put  it,  from
    "Something called Nothing"  (1), or to put it more correctly, from
    empty space, the vacuum, the void.

    To comprehend the significance of  this statement, we will have to
    take a detour  into  the  phenomenon  of fluctuations  with  which
    quantum theory abounds,  including  the fluctuations of empy space
    itself.

    Before the advent  of  quantum theory,  physics  taught  that  any
    simple oscillator such   as  a  pendulum,  when   excited,   would
    eventually come to  rest  if  not  continuously  energized by some
    outside force such  as a spring.   This  is  because  of  friction
    losses in the system.

    After it was recognized that quantum theory was  a  more  accurate
    representation of nature,  one  of  the findings of quantum theory
    was that such an oscillator would  in  fact not come to total rest
    but rather would continue to "jiggle" randomly about  its  resting
    point with a  small amount of energy always present, the so-called
    "zero-point energy."

    Although it may not be observable  to  the eye on your grandfather
    clock because it is so minute, it is nonetheless very real, and in
    many physical systems has important consequences.

    One example is the presence of a certain amount  of  "noise"  in a
    microwave receiver that  can never be gotten rid of, no matter how
    perfect the technology.  This is  an  example which shows that not
    only physical devices  such  as  pendulums have this  property  of
    incessant fluctuation, but  also  fields,  such as electromagnetic
    fields (radio waves, microwaves, light, X-rays, etc.).

    As it turns  out,  even  though   the  zero-point  energy  in  any
    particular mode of an electromagnetic field is minute,  there  are
    so many possible modes of propagation (frequencies, directions) in
    open space, the  zero-point  energy  summed  up  over all possible
    modes is quite  enormous;  in fact,  greater  than,  for  example,
    nuclear energy densities.   And  this in all of so-called  "empty"
    space around us.   Let  us  concentrate  on  the  effects  of such
    electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations.

    With such large  values,  it  might   seem  that  the  effects  of
    electromagnetic zero-point energy  should  be quite  obvious,  but
    this is not the case because of its extremely uniform density.

    Just as a  vase  standing  in  a  room  is not likely to fall over
    spontaneously, so a  vase bombarded  uniformly  on  all  sides  by
    millions of ping pong balls would not do likewise  because  of the
    balanced conditions of the uniform bombardment.

    The only evidence  of  such  a barrage might be minute jiggling of
    the vase, and similar mechanisms are thought to be involved in the
    quantum jiggle of zero-point motion.

    However, there are certain conditions  in  which the uniformity of
    the background electromagnetic  zero-point  energy   is   slightly
    disturbed and leads to physical effects.

                                  Page 2
    One is the  slight perturbation of the lines seen from transitions
    between atomic states known as the Lamb Shift (2), named after its
    discoverer, Willis Lamb.

    Another, also named for its discoverer,  is  the Casimir Effect, a
    unique attractive quantum   force  between  closely-spaced   metal
    plates.

    An elegant analysis  by  Milonni  et.  al. at Los Angeles National
    Laboratory (3) shows the Casimir  force  to  be  due  to radiation
    pressure from the  background  electromagnetic  zero-point  energy
    which has become unbalanced due to the presence of the plates, and
    which results in the plates being pushed together.

    From this it  would  seem  that  it  might  be possible to extract
    electrical energy from the vacuum,  and  indeed the possibility of
    doing so (at least in principle) has been shown in a paper of that
    same name by Robert Forward (4) at Hughes Research Laboratories in
    Malibu, California.

    What does this have to do with our basic questions?   Let's  start
    with the question  as  top  why  the electron in a simple hydrogen
    atom doesn't radiate as it circles the proton in its stable ground
    state atomic orbit.

    This issue has been re-addressed  in a recent paper by the author,
    this time taking into account what has been learned over the years
    about the effects  of zero-point energy. (5)  There  it  is  shown
    that the electron  can  be  seen as continually radiating away its
    energy as predicted  by  classical   theory,   but  simultaneously
    absorbing a compensating  amount  of energy from the  ever-present
    sea of zero-point  energy  in  which the atomm is immersed, and an
    assumed equilibrium between  these  two  processes  leads  to  the
    correct values for the parameters known to define the ground-state
    orbit.

    Thus the ground-state  orbit  is set by a dynamic  equilibrium  in
    which collapse of  the  state  is prevented by the presence of the
    zero-point energy.  The significance  of  this observation is that
    the very stability  of  matter  itself appears to  depend  on  the
    presence of the   underlying  sea  of  electromagnetic  zero-point
    energy.

    With regard to the gravitational  attraction  that is described so
    well by Einstein's  theory, its fundamental nature  is  still  not
    well understood.  Whether  addressed  simply  in terms of Newton's
    Law, or with the full rigor of general  relativity,  gravitational
    theory is basically descriptive in nature, without  revealing  the
    underlying dynamics for that description.

    As a result,  attempts  to  unify  gravity  with  the other forces
    (electromagnetic, strong and weak  nuclear forces) or to develop a
    quantum theory of  gravity  have  foundered  again  and  again  on
    difficulties that can be traced back to a lack of understanding at
    a fundamental level.

    To rectify these   difficulties,   theorists  by  and  large  have
    resorted to ever-increasing levels  of mathematical sophistication
    and abstraction, as in the recent development of  supergravity and
    superstring theories.

                                  Page 3
    Taking a completely   different   tack   when   addressing   these
    difficulties in the  sixties,  the  well-known  Russian  physicist
    Andrei Sakharov put forward the somewhat radical  hypothesis  that
    gravitation might not  be  a  fundamental  interaction at all, but
    rather a secondary or residual effect  associated with other (non-
    gravitational) fields. (6)

    Specifically, Sakharov suggested that gravity might  be an induced
    effect brought about  by  changes  in the zero-point energy of the
    vacuum, due to the presence of matter.

    If correct, gravity would then be understood as a variation on the
    Casimir theme, in  which  background  zero-point-energy  pressures
    were again responsible.

    Although Sakharov did not develop the concept much further, he did
    outline certain criteria such a theory would have  to meet such as
    predicting the value  of  the gravitational constant G in terms of
    zero-point-energy parameters.

    The approach to gravity outlined  by  Sakharov  has  recently been
    addressed in detail,  and  with  positive  reults,  again  by  the
    author. (7)

    The gravitational interaction is shown to begin with the fact that
    a particle situated  in  the  sea  of  electromagnetic  zero-point
    fluctuations develops a "jitter"  motion,  or ZITTERBEWEGUNG as it
    is called.

    When there are two or more particles they are each  influenced not
    only by the  fluctuating  background field, but also by the fields
    generated by the  other  particles,   all   similarly   undergoing
    ZITTERBEWEGUNG motion, and  the  inter-particle  coupling  due  to
    these fields results in the attractive gravitational force.

    Gravity can thus  be  understood  as  a kind of long-range Casimir
    force.  Because of its electromagnetic  unerpinning, gravitational
    theory in this form constitutes what is known in the literature as
    an "already-unified" theory.

    The major benefit of the new approach is that it  provides a basis
    for understanding various  characteristics  of  the  gravitational
    interaction hitherto unexplained.

    These include the relative weakness  of  the  gravitational  force
    under ordinary circumstances (shown to be due to the fact that the
    coupling constant G depends inversely on the large  value  of  the
    high-frequency cutoff of the zero-point-fluctuation spectrum); the
    existence of positive  but  not  negative  mass  (traceable  to  a
    positive-only kinetic-energy basis  for  the  mass parameter); and
    the fact that  gravity  cannot be shielded (a consequence  of  the
    fact that quantum zero-point-fluctuation "noise" in general cannot
    be shielded, a  factor  which in other contexts sets a lower limit
    on the detectability of electromagnetic signals).

    As to where the ubiquitous electromagnetic zero-point energy comes
    from, historically there  have   been   two  schools  of  thought:
    existence by fiat  as  part  of  the  boundary conditions  of  the
    universe, or generation  by  the  (quantum-fluctuation)  motion of
    charged particles that constitute matter.

                                  Page 4
    A straightforward calculation   of   the  latter  possibility  has
    recently been carried out by the author. (8)

    It was assumed that zero-point fields  drive  particle motion, and
    that the sum of particle motions throughout the universe  in  turn
    generate the zero-point fields, in the form of a self-regenerating
    cosmological feedback cycle not unlike a cat chasing its own tail.

    This self-constistent approach  yielded the known zero-point field
    distribution, thus indicating a dynamic-generation process for the
    zero-point fields.

    Now as to the question of why quantum  theory.  Although knowledge
    of zero-point fields emerged from quantum physics  as that subject
    matured, Professor Timothy  Boyer at City College in New York took
    a contrary view.

    He bagan asking in the late sixties  what  would happen if we took
    classical physics as it wasæand inroduced a background of random,
    clasical fluctuating fields    of    the   zero-point    spectral
    distribution type.  Could  such  an  all-classical model reproduce
    quantum theory in its entirety,  and  might  this possibility have
    been overlooked by  the founders of quantum theory  who  were  not
    aware of the existence of such a fluctuating background field?

    (First, it is  clear  from  the  previously-mentioned cosmological
    calculation that such a field distribution  would reproduce itself
    on a continuing dynamic basis.)

    Boyer began by tackling the problems that led to  the introduction
    of quantum theory  in  the  first  place,  such  as  the blackbody
    radiation curve and the photoelectric  effect.   One  by  one  the
    known quantum results were reproduced by this upstart neoclassical
    approach, now generally referred to as Stochastic  Electrodynamics
    (SED) (9), as contrasted to quantum electrodynamics (QED).

    Indeed, Milonni at  Los Alamos noted in a review of the Boyer work
    that had physicists in 1900 thought  of  taking  this  route, they
    would probably have  been  more  comfortable with  this  classical
    approach than with Planck's hypothesis of the quantum, and one can
    only speculate as  to  the direction that physics would have taken
    then.

    The list of   topics  successfully   analyzed   within   the   SED
    formulation (i.e., yielding  precise quantitative  agreement  with
    QED treatments) has  now  been  extended  to  include the harmonic
    oscillator, Casimir and  Van der  Waals  forces  and  the  thermal
    effects of acceleration through the vacuum, to name a few.

    Out of this  work  emerged the reasons for such phenomena  as  the
    uncertainty principle, the   incessant   fluctuation  of  particle
    motion, the existence  of  Van  der  Waals  forces  even  at  zero
    temperature, and so forth, all shown to be due to the influence of
    the unceasing activity of the random background fields.

    There are also some notable failures in SED, such  as  transparent
    derivation of something as simple as Schrodinger's equation, which
    turns out as yet to be an intractable problem.

    Therefore, it is unlikely that quantum theory as we have come to

                                  Page 5
    know it and  love  it  will  be entirely replaced by a refurbished
    classical theory in the near future.

    Nonetheless, the successes to date  of  the  SED  approach, by its
    highlighting of  the  role  of background zero-point-fluctuations,
    means that when  the  final  chapter is written on quantum theory,
    field fluctuations in empty space  will  be  accorded  an  honored
    position.

    And now to the preeminent question of all, where  did the Universe
    come from?  Or,  in modern terminology, what started the Big Bang?
    Could quantum fluctuations of empty  space  have  something  to do
    with this also?

    Well, Prof. Edward Tryon of Hunter College of the  City University
    of New York  thought so when he proposed in 1973 that our Universe
    may have originated as a fluctuation  of  the  vacuum  on  a large
    scale, as "simply one of those things which happen  from  time  to
    time." (10)

    This idea was  later  refined  and  updated  within the context of
    inflationary cosmology by Alexander  Vilenkin of Tufts University,
    who proposed that  the  universe  is created by quantum  tunneling
    from literally nothing  into  the  something we call our universe.
    (11)

    Although highly speculative, these  types  of models indicate once
    again that physicists find themselves turning again  and  again to
    the Void (and the fluctuations thereof) for their answers.

    Those with a  practical bent of mind may be left with yet one more
    unanswered question.  Can this emerging  Rosetta  Stone of physics
    be used to translate such lofty insights into mundane application?

    Could the engineer   of   the   future   specialize   in   "vacuum
    engineering?"  Could the energy crisis be solved by harnessing the
    energies of the zero-point sea?

    After all, since the basic zero-point energy form is highly random
    in nature, and  tending  towards self-cancellation, if a way could
    be found to bring order out of chaos,  the,  because of the highly
    energetic nature of  the  vacuum  fluctuations,  relatively  large
    effects could in principle be produced.

    Given our relative ignorance at this point, we must fall back on a
    quote given by Podolny (12) when contemplating this same issue.

    "It would be  just  as  presumptuous  to  deny  the feasibility of
    useful application as it would be  irresponsible to guarantee such
    application."

    Only the future can reveal the ultimate use to which  Mankind will
    put this remaining  Fire  of the Gods, the quantum fluctuations of
    empty space.
