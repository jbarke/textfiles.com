  Today I found an elegant and simple way to prove my theory on the source of
  the NEUTRAL SPIKE.  I was working in a  nursing home installing some simple
  buzzers on the door alarm system and was testing and tuning the sound level
  of the audio  output (the loudness of the buzz) when I  got  a  shock  that
  nearly took me  right off the ladder.  Now this buzzer is powered by 24V AC
  and you can't get a shock out of 24VAC  but  when  you  consider  the SPIKE
  PHENONENON it is awsome.  This buzzer is made by EDWARDS,  called  a LUNGEN
  BUZZER, CAT. NO 15-2G5 24 V AC 60 HZ.  I suggest all that are interested in
  duplicating the following  experiment,  go  to your local electrical supply
  house and get this particular model for  it has features that are ideal for
  the purpose of producing NEUTRAL SPIKES.  This buzzer is  constructed so as
  both sides of the 24V AC is floating (insulated) with the solid steel (not
  laminated) core is  grounded  to  the frame or metal case.  The solid steel
  core is of  very  mild  steel  which  agravates  the  production  of  spike
  potential.  Remember I  said you need to think backwards?  Yes  we  want  a
  magnetic core which  has  the most horible spike producing characteristics.
  If there is an engineer out there who  could  suggest an ideal material for
  this application, by  all  means  speak  up  for  I would  love  input  and
  participation in this  project.   I brought home a new buzzer and hooked it
  up to a standard 24V AC step-down transformer  and  attached  my multimeter
  (Fluke 87)meter with one lead (black ground) to the case  of the buzzer and
  used the red  lead to test the potential on the two buzzer terminals.  With
  24V AC running the buzzer I measured over 2000V coming out of the iron core
  of the buzzer.  What is interesting  is  the  fact  that with the adjusting
  screw I could  vary  the voltage output by changing the  frequency  of  the
  buzzer contacts. Now  to  build  a  similar  device  that will enable me to
  explore a possible  resonant  region   that   may  exist  related  to  this
  phenomenon.  I am willing to bet that there will prove  to  be  a  definite
  relationship to inductance/impedance of the coil and stray capacitance that
  may be involved in the simple circuit.  Therefore I will be looking for a
  point of resonance  that  will maximize the spike output.  Before the TESLA
  COIL builders out there jump in and say  it is a simple voltage multiplying
  based on impedance ratio,  well I only have one coil (no secondary).  Joel,
  put that in  your  pipe  and smoke it a while and see  if  you  can  see  a
  solution other than magnetic constricturing as you described earlier in one
  of you messages.   If  a  saturating  magnetic  flux  is  driving electrons
  directly out of the iron atoms then visualize the potential here since this
  whole planet is             practically              iron.             NORM

  Hi Norm,
  Count on me  for confirmation of this.  About the same time that I uploaded
  COILBAK, I also  uploaded COILUNIT,  which  is  a  12VDC  relay,  energized
  through its normally   closed  contacts,  so  that  it   would   open/close
  continuously at very  close  to  its aggregate resonance, just like the old
  vibrators that they used in car radios  to  produce  AC for the vacuum tube
  radios.  They never lasted too long as they would beat themselves to death,
  but they usually outlasted the warranty.  Anyway, COILUNIT  produces  those
  same high negative  spikes,  and  when  connected to a rechargable battery,
  once the battery accepts the spikes,  the  terminal  voltage stops falling,
  and the voltage  stabilizes.  This is how the Dutch inventor  got  so  many
  miles on his electric motorcycle.  Anyway, it is subject to mechanical time
  delays, so it  is  not  an  above-unity device, which leads to the "cranky"
  semiconductors that Woody spoke of, and  which  COILBAK  depends upon.  The
  spikes are exactly as you describe.  Thanks again, my friend.
  Joel

  To all out there who may want to experiment with the generation  of neutral
  spike energy,please be advised that to do so you must "float the ground" or
  neutral to get  a  handle  on  the  spikes  coming  out  of  the  iron.  In
  electrical circles this is a "NO NO" because  electrical engineers consider
  spikes as a  nussiance  and  bothersome  output that they  try  to  totally
  supressbecause of it's  destructive  properties.  Since the voltages go off
  the scaleand sometimes have current magnitudes  that they elect not to deal
  with they simply  install  varistors and such devices to  effectively  tahe
  this un-wanted energy  to  earth  ground.  Our objective is to conserve all
  this energy and put it to some use.   My  asvice  is  just  be careful when
  dealing with any  electricaldevice  on  which you are working  that  has  a
  floating neutral or earth ground. Norm

  Norm, your shocking  experience with the 24 volt door buzzer brings a whole
  new perspective to  the  expression   "gonna   ring   your   chimes"!   One
  suggestion: to increase the output of the old ignition  coils,  a condenser
  was used in  conjunction  with  the  coil  -  one  of the few cases where a
  capacitor was used NOT to reduce an  inductive  spike.   Try  using a small
  capacitor in different configurations with your coil.  You  might find that
  working together, the   electrons   pulled  from  the  dielectric  and  the
  electrons pulled from the iron might  "aid"  one  another.  I've never even
  seen it proved  that  the  "electrons"  pulled  from the  dielectric  in  a
  capacitor are identical to the ones released in your iron core - they might
  in reality appear similar but in truth be different particles or forces.
  The capacitor electrons might, for example, be "hot" current, and the spike
  current "cold".  I  don't have a test which would differentiate the two, if
  they do in fact exist.  Just a musing.  >> Bert

  Hi Norm!  We  too use the Edwards buzzers and I have shocked the pee out of
  meself with one when it was powered....however,  ours uses 110VAC but is an
  Edwards....they too are tunable with a vibrating plate  that  sits  over  a
  solenoid winding....the plate  is  "balanced"  over this flat solenoid post
  which is surrounded by the coil driven  by  the  VAC...   As  the  plate is
  jerked back and  forth  in  the varying flux, it slaps  against  the  post,
  producing the sound....not  only  frequency but also volume can be adjusted
  by "tensioning" the plate against the  post....kind of like a fixed Chladni
  waveplate...  I must  say,  I  never  measured the voltage  on  ours,  just
  assumed it to  be  a trickle of the 110VAC...but now that you mention it, I
  will check it out tonite...
  I kind of think it is a series of spikes,  at  the  same  frequency  as the
  plate is vibrating (you know, come to think of it, on ours you don't really
  change the frequency all that much, it is more like a 1/2  tone,  i.e. flat
  or sharp) but  you  CAN make it louder or softer...  So, the frequency does
  not change so much as the INTENSITY  of  the  slap...now  if  the  plate is
  magnetically fluxed up  (no  pun  intended),  and  it slaps  the  solenoid,
  possibly the bucking magnetic fields create this inductive spike....dammit,
  now I HAVE  to  look  into  this...   Kind of sounds like the very oldstyle
  multivibrators that Joel mentioned...they  needed them to get the 300VDC to
  run the vacuum tubes in car radios (well, some ran at 150)  and  you needed
  plate voltages along  with  heater  voltages....I  think  vacuum  tubes are
  sssoooo interesting and we missed out on much when transistors took over.
  So, can we add another winding to tap  off  this?   Or  use a capacitor and
  some diodes to  build  up  a  charge??   Or  is  there  any  possible  gain
  associated with this.   Right  now,  I can't see how that would be, despite
  the interesting properties of iron,  so  a  test  is  definitely  in order,
  preferably by several   people   for   several   viewpoints....gee   thanks
  Norm!...<g>...>>> Jerry

  Hi Bert and   Norm!    You   know,  Bob  Aldrichs  comments  about  "liquid
  electricity" might be a way to store  up  energy  beyond  what is currently
  accepted...I think he said in one of the messages what  was  being  used to
  hold this energy  that  could  be  "sloshed  around"  like  fluid  when the
  device/metal/material was almost full...very  bizarre  but I think there is
  more to it  than  we  currently  understand....and  it will  be  with  some
  combination of elements  that  were all available in the late 1900's, so it
  won't be something spooky like the more  hard  to  find  metals...>>> Geez,
  perhaps a means  of  holding  this  high  voltage multi-vibrator  generator
  spikes might be  to  try  this  liquid electricity thing...will look up the
  messages to see what kind of metal was used...>>>  Jerry

  Jerry: Have you  ever  looked  at  a   Model   T   Ford  ignition  vibrator

  are at the center of the iron core of the coil with everything contained in
  a little oak  wood box.  I have one in the shop and will experiment with it
  also.  This thing puts out a real big  spark  on  a continous baseswith the
  rotor button sending the spark to the right cylinder.  Timing  was a little
  rough but hell  the  model  T engine seldom ever ran over a thousond RPM. I
  will play games with this buzzerand try  a  few caps of different values to
  determine if the output will improve.  Yes I have already  planned  a  high
  voltage diode pick-off  of  the high voltage to a capacitor storage bank to
  be used in a different stage.  I'll let  the buzzer device be the driver to
  deliver the HV  pulses  to the cap storage.  I'm curious  as  to  how  much
  charge we can accumulate and how fast a large cap will fill up.  In a paper
  I put in  the  Vangard  packet  awile  back,   GE  had laid out a method of
  determining the current output of high voltage devices by timing the charge
  rate into a known capacitance.  I guess this is the only way since we don't
  have any kind of high voltage current  meters.  Bert and I discussed how to
  hook this beast  up  to  my  scope (very carefully) and  concluded  that  a
  voltage divider was  the  best approach.  I hope you have success with your
  110V buzzer at work.  I have to admit that I have not worked with line
  voltage buzzers before.  Do you really think that Joel's ORGONE ACCUMULATOR
  has any chance of levitation or getting  high  if  he uses poppy seeds.  He
  should try a little "WEED" to see if it would lift off.  Norm

  Jerry: I failed  to  tell  you  yesterday  that  Bert  and  I  had  a  long
  conversation about the  buzzer  device  and  had agreed that the adjustment
  screw allowed you to adjust the dwell  of  the device the same as adjusting
  the breajer point   jap   in   a   conventional   igniyion   system.    The
  armature,spring and other  mass  associated with the moving contact tend to
  remain at the (JOEL) mass aggregate resonance, so frequency is shifted only
  very slightly when the point gap is adjusted.  I  am going to use my strobe
  light to study the dynamics of the armature and the gap dwell relationship.
  Heck, I already  have  all  the  parts assembled to build  a  rather  large
  "buzzer".  The coil  will be 4" in diameter,5" long with a solid soft steel
  core.  If scale means anything in this  case  I should be able to get about
  10KV out to my cap storage.  We'll see.  Norm

  I acquired a big box of "dead" alkaline 9v batteries.  Wanting  to prove to
  myself (and to  possibly  use  it for demonstrations) the idea that "static
  electricity" is simply voltage, I connected  the  batteries  in  series  by
  plugging them into  each  other  skewed,  built  up  quite   a  large  (and
  dangerous) battery bank,   then  used  the  resulting  two  lead  wires  at
  1500Volts to deflect a little scrap of  charged  scotch tape.  It works!  I
  was also able  to charge up coins sitting on insulators,  then  detect  the
  charge with an  FET  electroscope.   Then I discovered carbon arcs with old
  battery carbon rods, and wasted hours burning patterns into a two-by-four.
  .
  For anyone who doesn't know: 9volt batteries  can  be  clipped in series by
  sticking them into each other's clips offset and building up long

  "bandoliers" of them.   I  got  mine  from  a  friend  who works in a large
  theatrical company, they  go  through   hundreds   for  their  portable  FM
  microphones, and discard them when the voltage falls to 8.5v or 8.0.  These
  alkalines still pack  about  an ampere when shorted.  If  you  can  collect
  enough, you end up with a portable power source of thousands of volts
  at hundreds of mA, not connected to house current.  I may eventually become
  famous for being killed by a 9v battery.  (actually, several!)
  .
  (I think the NEUMAN machine automobile demo used this trick, a photo of the
  car's trunk looked  like  it carried several cubic feet of series 9V cells.
  Donated by the manufacturer fortunately)

  Hi Folks!  Just got a call regarding the TOD circuit.  It was taken over to
  an electronic engineer who has vast experience with power measurements.
  Hhe hooked the  TOD  circuit up to a scope and measured  it  for  about  30
  minutes.  During and  after  this,  he  is  quite bewildered as the circuit
  definitely is outputting more power than it is taking to run it.  It is not
  feeding itself, but seems to be generating  overunity  just as specified in
  the TOD.ASC file written by Lee.  The MOSFET parameters  were  looked up to
  see if there  were  anything unusual in them and the engineer said they had
  an internal diode (for clamping, I think  he  said),  the  point being that
  this seems to snap or prevent any kind of backflow of energy,  thus lending
  a cumulative buildup of energy from the spikes.....  So, get on it...I know
  it only came on last night, but get it OUT and let's get crackin'.....

  Hi Jerry,
     I did call and talked to the stock department of J.C.  Whitney, and they
  were mystified as  to  why  the 3.3 mhz batt charger wasn't in the catalog,
  but he still had the stock number and  I  ordered  a  solar powered charger
  that said it put a 3 to 4 mhz signal on the battery, if  I  remember right.
  So it will  be  coming soon, we'll see what this is all about. But I really
  wanted one that I could use in my shop,  you  know,  charge  car  batteries
  right now not over a period of two months! Is the one you are familiar with
  a wall powered model?
     As to Psychomaneum, I believe the principle works, because my own father
  in law saw  my  mother (deceased) in a reflection off a  livingroom  window
  while watching TV.  As to whether it should cancel, well, she's dead, isn't
  she?  (bad joke).
     As to  liquid  electricity, well, think about this, if matter is nothing
  but compacted energy, it stands to reason  that  there would be an easy way
  to release some  of that energy. Free Energy.  you just  have  to  buy  the
  matter. (coal, dirt,  copper  wire,  whatever)  Wouldn't  it  be  a hoot if
  electricity is just that? rarefied matter?   And  that can be condensed. By
  the way, the electrode used for the center conductor of the "capacitor" was
  silver, like silver leaves, suspended in the chamber. This  is  all I could

  Hi Norm!  Great!  Will be nice to see some verification on this, especially
  the "improved" versions  that actually  can  power  something  or  recharge
  it....in the original the duty cycle from the 555 was something like

  the dissipator....kind of  like  poking holes in a water hose that is under

  Hi Norm! your buzzer may in fact have two coils. If the core is a single
  solid steel part  that  is  configured as a loop or if  it  and  associated
  buzzer flapper and  case  connect to form a loop or continuous circuit then
  you have a  shorted  turn  effect.  This  could  give  you  a  turns  ratio
  multiplication with the shorted turn acting as a primary from the induced
  voltage from the  magnetic  field  collapse.  It  could  be  acting  as  an
  autotransformer. Think about your variac transformer. Only one coil right?
  Of course having  a  good  conductive,  solid  core like your buzzer has is
  going to maximize eddy current effects  also. For you to get a shock out of
  the isolated case of the buzzer under this scenario, the  24v winding would
  have to be  acting  as  the secondary and then discharging into the case at
  some breakdown voltage. I'm just offering  this  as  a  suggested  possible
  explanation, so don't think I'm trying to debunk your idea.  Thats the last
  thing I would  want  to do because so often times it happens  that  someone
  will have a  novel idea that some supposed 'expert' will dismiss after only
  a superficial examination  of  the   phenomena   and   without  a  complete
  understanding of the situation. Where are you tapping  the  buzzer  to  get
  your voltage readings,  and  referenced  to  what? Case to ground? Have you
  determined the frequency of the high  voltage?  What does the waveform look
  like, sinusoidal or impulsed?

  For anyone out there building the TOD test device, a word  of  caution: the
  power MOSFET's Q2  and  Q3 can go ballistic if you pull one of the MOSFET's
  back stream.  They will instantly self-destruct  due to current saturation.
  I was going to "swap" Q1 and Q2.  I pulled Q1 and reached  over to pull Q2.
  In the 2  seconds  it took me to set down Q1 and grab Q2, Q2 had reached an
  estimated temperature of +400 degrees F. and blistered a couple of fingers.
  It then proceeded  to  vaporize and stink  up  Norm's  place.   Absolutely,
  positively, remove ALL  power before working on these little  guys  or  you
  won't be able to pick your nose for a week!  >> bert

  John:  Yes the  Hendershot  device  is  involved in this process.  I have a
  complete report on the Hendershot and  you  are  correct  about  the buzzer
  theory.  I suspect that Joe Neumans big coil works very similar  to what we
  are theorizing. Thanks for the feed-back, we are working on the TOD Circuit
  at the moment  and  will get back to the Neutral Spike device as soon as we
  can get some data to verify Lee's over-unity claims for his circuit.  If it
  can't be replicated by other researchers  then  it  is  considered invalid.

  Hi Lee! I read your report and tried to do some analysis of your circuit. I
  have some observations  and  some  questions.  First the observations:  You
  mentioned that the  current  flow  reverses  in  loop Q3 when the device is
  operated with the 'wire' collector. This seems to indicate that the node at
  Q2 source is going negative, and this  is  exactly  what  would be expected
  when rapidly switching  an  inductive load, which is what  your  long  wire
  'collector' represents. When  the  current reverses through Q3 you will not
  be able to shut it off untill the reverse  voltage  falls below the forward
  voltage of the internal diode in Q3. I think its about 1.5-2 volts for this
  device. The schematic indicates that V2 can be from 9-24volts. In order for
  the fets to fully swith on the gate to source voltage  must  be  10  volts.
  The threshold is  2  volts.  So if V1 is 18 volts V2 must be below 16 volts
  for the device to even begin to turn  on.  Your circuit topology is unusual
  for nchannel mosfets in that you are switching an inductive load in the low
  side of the switch so it is difficult to analyse as the VGS  will change as
  the source voltage  changes, hence the on state resistance is unknown. When
  fully switched on these fets have a resistance  of  about 0.6 ohms. Now for
  the Questions: How  are  you  measuring  current in the  circuits?  Do  the
  symbols mA1, mA2,  etc.   indicate  an in series ammeter of some kind? What
  does the voltage waveform look like at  the  Q2 source / Q3 drain node look
  like? Is it does it have a very high dvdt or is it relatively  slow or non-
  transient?  What is  the  manufacturer  of your 555 timer? The data sheet I
  looked at is National Semi., and they spec output switching time at 100 ns.
  You mentioned a 20 ns switching time.   Thanks  for  taking  the time to do
  this design to  verify  the Bearden theory and I hope  you  don't  mind  my
  questions.  - Gerald O'

  Norm, the IRF240's  CAN  be  used, but you really have to drop the value of
  the resistor in the gate circuit, as  well  as  drop the value of the drain
  resistors.  Since the 240's are really power monsters,  you  have  to punch
  them pretty hard  to  get  them  to  respond fast.  I've gotten them to the
  point that the rise time is less than 1 uSEC, and the inverted wave form

  values for it as well.  Call me and we'll  set  up  a time for Saturday. >>

  Jerry: Bert and I have spent a lot of time on this Tod circuit,  in fact we
  worked on it  at  Bert's place from 1.00PM Sat. till 10:00 PM and came to a
  conclusion as to what is going on in the circuit.  Bert is printing out all
  the graph plots  that  we  did of many  different  circuit  configurations,
  Collectors,loads and voltages  VS  freq's  etc.   Very  interesting,   some
  configurations give gain  ratios  up  to 100:1, others give 50:1 and others
  give 25:1 output.  However, remember  what  JOEL said, "If you can't hook a
  plow to it and plant beans then it ain't worth a sh--.   Well  the  out put
  pulses or of  such  a  nature that they fake the MA or Micro-amp meter into
  believing that real power exist when  this  thing cant even light a tennie-
  tiny LED.  The secret is in the wave form.  When I flew for the military we
  had a Cessna A-37 twin engine jet that we called a 6000  #  dog whistle for
  it converted good  jet  fuel  into  a  high pitch noise.  Well this circuit
  converts a decent shaped current pulse  into  a funny shaped wave form that
  can't do any work what-so-ever.  We are going to write  the  whole thing up

  Some notes on our experiments with the TOD device.
  .
  Both Norm Wootan  and myself (Bert Pool) have each built  a  prototype  TOD
  device (see file   TOD.ZIP).   The  device  is  very  straight  forward  in
  construction.  The concept behind this  device,  basically, is to charge an
  inductive "collector" with a very short pulse (2 to 5 uSEC) and immediately
  capture the resulting discharge spike, which theoretically might contain
  additional available freed electrons from the copper or  electrons  grabbed
  from the virtual energy flux  to then be used in a load.
  .

                                     Page 9




  Together, we spent  many  hours  collecting  careful  measurements  with an
  impressive array of precision meters and  very good oscilloscopes. Norm and
  I both have excellent backgrounds in using 'scopes, and  we  know  how they
  can lie - but we also know that they can reveal hidden truths.
  .
  We carefully plotted  the  measured input current versus output current for
  pulse width signals ranging from 2 uSECs  to  60 uSECs, at repetition rates
  from a low of 15 pps (pulses per second) to slightly more  than  8,000 pps.
  We used a  variety  of  "collector"  coils, ranging from 400 ft of 12 gauge
  wire to 3300 feet of 22 gauge wire.
  .
  At 60 uSECs, 60 hertz, we even "measured"  an apparent input/output current
  gain of over 120 using precision Fluke 4 digit current meters.  We both had
  doubts that any  of  our  meters  could accurately measure currents of such
  short duration, and our oscilloscopes  showed  us that our concern was well
  founded.
  .
  Although the input pulse in one test was 60 uSEC wide,  the  output  signal
  delivered to the  load  consisted  of  two very narrow pulses corresponding
  precisely to the "rise" edge and "fall"  edge  of the 60 uSEC input signal.
  These two pulses had substantially smaller peak-to-peak  voltages  than the
  input, and they  were only NANOSECONDS in width - very, very narrow pulses.
  This meant that the power available to the load was infinitesimally small.
  Whereas we could take any of the the  2  uSEC  to  60 uSEC INPUT pulses and
  cause a tiny 2.5 volt incandescent bulb to faintly glow (our source battery
  voltage was 12.56  volts), the nanosecond pulsed output  current  from  the
  circuit output to the same bulb produced absolutely no output, even at very
  high repetition rates.   If our current meters were telling the truth, that
  bulb should have been several times brighter on the output side of the
  circuit, vs the input side.  It was not.
  .
  The digital meters used in our tests are  designed to measure CONTINUOUS DC
  current, NOT micosecond  or  nanosecond  pulsed direct  current.  The  only
  equipment available to   the  general  experimenter  which  can  accurately
  measure such fast events is a good oscilloscope.  Not one of our meters was
  able to accurately read the current in  either the input or output circuits
  because the signals were so very short and the mark/space ratio so small.
  .
  Conclusions:
  .
  1) The TOD device fails to exhibit an output that is even near
     UNITY operation, much less over-unity.
  .
  2) Existing current meters CANNOT accurately measure either input
     or output current of these small pulses.  DC current meters
     are designed to measure continuous current, AC meters are
     designed to measure sinusoidal waveforms - the TOD input and
     output signals exhibit neither of these characteristics.
     The inability of these meters to measure current pulses
     reliably results in false current readings.
  .
  3) Careful oscillograph viewings of the input and output signals
     do not support an over-unity claim .
  .
  Recommendations:
  .
  1) To prevent erroneous readings, researchers should be cautioned
     against trying to measure pulsed signal currents with meters
     designed for continuous current or for sinusoidal AC current.
  .

                                    Page 10




  2) In the future, any device which claims over-unity operation
     should be able to operate a real-world load.  It is suggested
     that this load be a precision carbon resistor, and that the
     load resistor be placed in a water-bath calorimeter and power
     calculated from temperature rise in the load. (see 3 below),
     not from voltage/current readings.
  .
     A precision carbon resistor is a very stable and exact load
     whose operating characteristics stay constant, even under
     variable current conditions.  The resistor can have its wires
     insulated, and then be placed in an exact volume of water in a
     Dewar flask (thermos bottle). Thermocouples can be used to
     measure the degree of heating of the water that is caused by
     current being dissipated as heat within the load. This is a
     very reliable, universally accepted method of measuring power
     being delivered to a load.  The resistor and water do not care
     whether the power is AC, DC, or pulsed - the measurements will
     reliably tell you how much useable power is being delivered to
     the load.  Period.
  .
     Incandescent lamps present a pretty good adhoc test load as
     well - the filament, because of its thermal mass, will tend to
     average the effects of short duration pulses, and the light
     output can be measured and calibrated using optical sensors
     such as photocells or phototransistors.
     .
  3) We do not want to throw a  "wet blanket" on the zpe energy
     scene.  But we have to encourage experimenters to try and
     standardize to a measurement method that is accurate and
     reasonably easy (and cheap) to make. A calorimetric method
     fits both of these requirements.  We build new energy devices
     every day ourselves, and we have found out the hard way just
     how tricky accurate power measurements can be when using
     meters and 'scopes. ESPECIALLY when working with micro or nano
     second pulses!
  .
  **************************************************************************
  Norm and I  will  place on KeelyNet sometime in the next several days plans
  for building a shade-tree calorimeter  which  any  serious experimenter can
  put together for less than $50 worth of kitchen utensils  and  Radio  Shack
  goodies, many of  which you probably already have lying around or can steal
  from your kid's lunch box.  If you measure  over-unity with this baby, then
  you've something to get excited about!  In the future,  this  will  be  our
  standard of power  measurement  for  any  electrical  device claiming over-
  unity.  Not volts.   Not  amps. Not millivolt-microamps.   Just  plain  old
  simple, reliable, unequivocal calories.
  **************************************************************************
  We'll include charts  for converting calories to more familiar  measurement
  units - heck  we  might  even  get  fancy  and  throw  in  some metric unit
  conversions  - milli foot newt futons, or some such thing!  >> Bert & Norm

  This is in reference to the TOD.ZIP circuit from Lee Trippett!
  .
  Don't you just hate to dial into Keely Net and find that the board has been

                                    Page 11




  dead and no  one's posted anything?  Well, a lot's been going on, and those
  of us who've been iced in here in Dallas  have  put the unexpected days off
  to good use.   Read  and  enjoy.   Better  yet,  you'd best  warm  up  your
  soldering iron!
  .
  1) an unexpected interruption from Lee Trippett
  .
  A few days  ago  Lee  Trippett sent us a diagram for a simple pulse circuit
  which was supposed to dump a pulse of  current into a coil and then connect
  a load to  the isolated coil (collector) to extract any  over-unity  power,
  ala Tom Bearden  -  minus  the  degenerate power conductor.  Lee had gotten
  some incredible meter readings which showed very high input-to-output power
  ratios.  A couple  of  us  here  in  Dallas  immediately  stopped  whatever
  experiments we had  in  progress  and  built  a  couple of  these  devices.
  Independent confirmation found  the  current readings were erroneous due to
  the fact that the circuit had the experimenter try to measure micro to nano
  second wide pulses with current meters  designed  to  measure  steady-state
  d.c. Fast oscilloscopes showed no real power gain. I dismissed the circuit
  as an excellent but faulty try, and then I went back to my work.
  .
  2) nose to the grind wheel
  .
  As many of  you  who follow the postings on this net know,  I  proposed  an
  experiment several days  ago and invited comments: if you connect a battery
  to a very long wire for 1 uSEC then  disconnect  it,  and  you  have an LED
  which is 4 uSECs away (several thousand feet of wire),  will  the LED light
  up?  Don't be  too  quick  to answer, for by the time the voltage potential
  gets to the LED, the BATTERY WILL HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE CIRCUIT
  FOR OVER 3 MICROSECONDS!  Can an LED light  up even when there is no longer
  a battery supplying potential in the circuit? That's what  I  was trying to
  prove. What is  nice  is  that  it is a yes or no problem.  You either have
  light, or you don't.  The purpose of the experiment is to determine whether
  a conductor can be potentialized and  power  withdrawn without running down
  the battery.
  .
  3) The ghost of TOD returns
  .
  The lesson learned  from  Trippett's attempt to measure  pulses  with  d.c.
  meters was still  very  fresh  in  my  mind.  I  needed  to measure current
  accurately in MY circuit, so I set up  my  meter  in  the d.c. power supply
  lead to my  circuit, not in any area where pulses were involved.   Just  to
  make sure stray  pulses  from  my  oscillator  (NE-555,  the same as Lee's)
  didn't get back to the meter through  the  power buss, I added several 0.01
  ufd spike suppressor capacitors to the power leads on the chips, and threw
  in an extra 1,000 ufd across the main buss to really filter  the  d.c. back
  to the meter.   I damn sure was not going to have any a.c. crap screwing up
  my current measurements! My 'scope showed  the  prettiest  11.65  volt pure
  d.c. input power anyone could ask for.
  .
  4) Wiring my test experiment - LOTS of wire!
  .
  In my test I originally was going to use two 5,000 foot  18  gauge wires to
  perform my LED  test.   Norman  Wootan found several thousand feet of RG-5x
  coaxial cable, which is much easier to use.  The circuit was very simple: a
  555 oscillator provided pulses adjustable  from 1 uSEC to 20 uSEC wide at a
  repetition rate from a few hundred to several thousand pulses per second.
  The 555 puts out a negative going pulse, and I wanted positive pulses, so I
  fed tha 555's  output  into  a CMOS CD-4001 NOR gate wired  to  act  as  an
  inverter to give  me  positive  going  pulses. The CD-4001 chip is nice for
  this work, because it can supply current directly to an LED without needing

                                    Page 12




  any current limiting  resistors.   I checked the output of the 4001 and had
  very, very nice 1 to 20 uSEC pulses.  Total circuit d.c. current, with no
  LED was 7.8 milliamps.  Plugging in  the  LED  directly  to the 4001 output
  caused the current to rise to 8.5 milliamps, and the LED  glowed nicely.  I
  removed the LED and connected the end of a 4,300 foot length of coax to the
  output of the  4001.   My  scope showed an expected drop in pulse amplitude
  and an increase  in  current to 9.5 milliamps.   Expected,  because  I  had
  measured the capacitance  of  the  coax and found that  between  the  inner
  conductor and the outer shielded jacket the coax measured out at 0.047 ufd.
  This capacitance attenuated  my pulse some, and loaded the circuit, but not
  to an untoward  degree.  I measured  the  total  circuit  current  -  total
  current going into the 555, the 4001, and the coax - and  with  NO LED load
  yet.  Current was  9.5  milliamps.  I then connected the LED to the far end
  of the coax.
  .
  5) The moment of truth
  .
  I had a 35 mhz dual trace triggered  scope  connected  to  each  end of the
  coax.  I saw  the 4001 put a 1 uSEC pulse of d.c. on the  near-end  of  the
  coax. Three uSECs  later  the pulse reached the LED at the other end of the
  coax. THE LED LIT UP.  EVEN THOUGH YOU  COULD PLAINLY SEE ON THE SCOPE THAT
  THE DRIVING POTENTIAL  HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE COAX SEVERAL  MICROSECONDS
  PREVIOUSLY.  EXPERIMENT COMPLETE!
  .
  Wasn't that exciting!?  Well, maybe some of you aren't real exciteable.   I
  know I didn't pee in my pants.  Heck, I didn't even dribble. Until I looked
  at my current  meter.  You remember that carefully filtered, isolated meter
  which was measuring  the total power  to  the  complete  circuit?   I  knew
  already that the LED wanted to pull about 0.5 ma current  to  light  up. My
  unloaded circuit was pulling 9.5 ma. Connecting the LED should have driven
  the current up to somewhere near 10 ma. Not even .01 of one ma more current
  flowed into the  circuit  to  light  up the LED!  So where the hell was the
  power to light the LED coming from?  It  sure as heck wasn't coming through
  my meter from  the  power  supply!   I connected and disconnected  the  LED
  several times.  My  meter  was registering current accurate to .01 of 1/000
  of one ampere.  It never moved. It never saw the LED load.  OK, I admit
  that maybe I dribbled a little then!
  .
  I called Norm.  He went to Radio Shack  and  got all the required parts.  I
  guided him over  the phone on how to connect everything.   Only  he  didn't
  have any coax!   It  was all on my bench.  But he did have several thousand
  feet of wire on a spool.  What the heck,  Lee  Trippitt  had tried to use a
  coil -  we decided to substitute Norm's spool of wire for  the  coax.  Norm
  got the same  results  as  I  did with the coax! Quickly, I disconnected my
  coax and connected a spool of 3,300 feet of 22 gauge hookup wire I had
  left over from my TOD experiment.  My  LED  glowed  as brightly as ever.  I
  found pulse width and frequency COULD be changed to force an increase in my
  current meter.  I could set a wider pulse and finally get  a  response from
  my current meter  when  I removed and inserted the LED. However, OPTIMIZING
  the pulse caused the current in the  circuit  to  DROP  when  the  LED  was
  plugged in!  Neither  Norm  or I could explain what we were  seeing.   Norm
  hooked a second LED across the first LED on his device. Now he had TWO
  glowing LEDS. His  meter  didn't  move  a  digit.   How  many  LED's can we
  parallel before we start to use power  from the supply?  We don't know yet.
  But two for sure!  Continued in next message.....................

  Experiment continued.............
  .
  As as additional  test,  I placed the LED near a precision photocell (which
  had a 2.2 ufd tantalum cap across it  to  filter pulses into pure d.c.) and
  measured light output.   The  photcell  showed  0.303 volts.   I  then  re-
  connected the LED  through a potentiometer to the d.c. power supply and set
  the pot so the LED put out the same light as earlier driven by the coil.
  I then disconnected/connected the LED  and watched my power meter.  Yep, it
  moved 0.5 ma, just as Old Ampere would have expected.  I moved the LED back
  to the coil circuit. I connected/disconnected the LED to  the  coil  again.
  Nope, still NO  additional current flow, but THE LED LIT UP JUST AS BRIGHT!
  Ah Ha!  Maybe the secret was in the pulses!  Maybe if I used pulses instead
  of pure d.c. on the control pot test?!  So I changed the pot connection
  on the LED test driver from the d.c. buss to the 4001 pulsed output and set
  the pot so the light output was the same  as  when the LED was connected to
  the coil. When  I unplugged the LED, current dropped 0.5  ma.   Ampere  was
  happy.  Volta was  happy.   So, this test showed that it didn't make a damn
  bit of difference whether the "control" test pot used d.c. or pulsed power!
  If I connected the LED to continuous  d.c.  or  pulsed d.c. I could see the
  current to the  circuit  go  UP when I connected the LED.   But  NOT  if  I
  connected the SAME  LED  to the coil circuit! I had run out of ideas.  That
  LED was going to light up and pull no  current from my power supply whether
  I liked it or not.
  .
  6) You too can amaze your friends!
  .
  Jerry is putting the diagram on the net.  Maybe five bucks  worth of parts.
  Less if you already built the TOD.  A spool of wire.  A sensitive photocell
  is optional (heck,  we'll  let  you borrow one of ours if you want).  There
  are no switching transistors involved.  Please build one of these and start
  with a narrow  pulse,  about  400  to  600 hertz repetition  rate.   Slowly
  increase pulse width until the LED glows.  Make note of the current on your
  current meter.  Disconnect  your  LED.   The  current  meter  SHOULD show a
  significant drop in power when you remove  the  load.   It won't.  Plug the
  LED back in.   It lights up. Current should go up.  It does  not.    Nifty,
  huh?
  .
  Norm thinks a  resonance  effect  is  taking place within the coil/coax.  I
  agree. Perhaps the coil or coax IS forming  a tuned circuit, and the LED is
  only an insignificant part of the circuit current....BUT  that  LED  is  in
  SERIES with the  coil!   Open  the LED and you open the coil - end of tuned
  circuit - if the measured current is  due  to  a tuned circuit, opening the
  circuit should stop the resonance and affect the current  anyway.   This is
  not observed to happen.  Build this critter and see if you can expand
  the observed results.
  .
  P.S., Norm has  been  able  to  coax the LEDs to light with a TOTAL circuit
        current of 2.5 ma!  That's combined  power  to  the  LED's,  and both
        chips.  I can't get below 7.5 ma.  He's using a much  different  coil
        than I.  I'd  be much interested in hearing what results you get.  >>

  I was going  to  drop  this off as a note about the TOD circuit, but I read
  messages first, and WOW.  I have to try it.  We have 500' spools of twisted
  pair at work, and maybe a big spool of microphone coax.  If I had done this
  experiment, I would  have used a commercial  signal  generator,  and  would
  totally have missed the strangeness in the current draw of the generator's
  power supply.  REAL  scientists would use expensive store-bought  equipment
  rather than 555's,  and  so  would  be  unable  to notice (or even measure)
  important data.
  .
  One thing I  must  ask:  is  your mA  meter  before  or  after  the  filter
  capacitors in the supply?  If the meter inserted BETWEEN the capacitors and
  your circuit, then there is AC current spikes going through  the  meter and
  maybe screwing things up.  If your filter capacitors are mounted on your
  breadboard itself, and  if  the  meter  is inserted in series with one lead
  coming from the separate power supply,  then  everything should be OK.  You
  probably are aware  that capacitors smooth out the DC voltage  by  allowing
  your circuit to  draw  big  glitches of current from the capacitors (and so
  THROUGH the wires between the capacitors and your circuit)
  .
  Oh, on the TOD circuit.  It looks like  both  Q2  and Q3 could be on at the
  same time at one edge of the square wave, thus shorting  the  power  supply
  directly to the  load.   This could be where the tiny pulses of current are
  coming from.  The cure would be to build  some  kind  of  logic  circuit to
  generate a very  fast  sequence  where  the transistors  turn  on  and  off
  alternately, but with  an  adjustable  deadzone  between  their  signals to
  guarantee that both are off for a short time.
  .
  Also in TOD, if a current starts going  in  the collector coil and then you
  turn Q2 off,  the  current WILL keep going because of inductive  kick,  and
  will blow a  path  through  the  VFETs  for  an instant.  You might want to
  connect a high speed power diode backwards across the collector coil.  Then
  again, if there are weird thing going  on in the circuit, adding this diode
  might just make the circuit behave "normally" and kill the interesting
  stuff.

  See if you have heard this acoustic idea before: I was  imagining  atoms in
  ether-flow terms, and  being  aware  that  sound vibrations are supposed to
  affect this process, wondered what would  happen if you had not one but TWO
  motions going on inside a solid.  IF you took a block of  iron  and blasted
  sound waves at  one  end,  you would set up a resonance (depending on block
  size) where the  atoms  inside  the  center  of  the  block  were  swerving
  violently back and forth.  NOW, if you did the same on another  face of the
  block, but had the driving wave 90 degrees out of phase, the overlap of
  the two waves  within  the  block would result in the atoms being forced to
  move all together in tiny circles, rather than just back and forth.  Normal
  physics wouldn't predict  that  anything   weird   would   happen  if  this
  experiment were performed,  at least as long as the frequencies  used  were
  low, not gigahertz  or  any-  thing.   What  would  you think would happen?
  Would the spiral effects near the actual  atoms  be forced to align because
  of the circular sloshing forces?  What happens when large  amounts of atoms
  all spin as  one?   Does  the iron block become a gyroscope, a psionic beam
  source, or does it just get slightly warm?
  .
  This might be a job for those large-volume piezo transducers you had found

  in one of  your surplus sources.  A contact transducer would be better than
  anything else for getting large wattages of sound into a solid object.  I'm
  interested in trying this out.

  Bill, my filters are on the circuit  board,  so  any  noise has to get past
  them to get  to  the meter, which IS in the power lead  to  the  board.   I
  really don't see  any  garbage  getting back to the meter - it is measuring
  steady d.c. current.  Your comments on  Q2 and Q3 not having any overlap in
  timing is absolutely correct - the circuit as is does not  have  any that I
  measured.  And, it  would  be  quite difficult to add an additional circuit
  between them to insert a few nanoseconds  delay  between  them  (at least I
  think it would be difficult...if you want to, please do  so  and  send me a
  copy of your change - I'd like to try it.).  >> Bert

  To SEE the  spike  energy of an inductive field collapse, at MANY TIMES the
  input voltage, assuming that you are like me and don't have a 'scope handy,
  do the following: Run down to Radio Shack,  and  pick up a relay, their P/N
  275-206, a couple of their 29 cent 9volt batteries, and a NE-2 neon lamp.
  Jumper pins 1 and 4 together.  Jumper pins 9 and 13 together.  Put the NE-2
  across pins 13 and 14, the coil leads.  Put the batteries  together  so you
  have 18volts output.   Put  the + lead on pin 12, and the minus lead on pin
  14.  As the  relay  self-oscillates,   the   NE-2  will  light,  apparently
  constantly, but actually  at  the  spike rate.  Since the  voltage  applied
  (18vdc) is well  below  the  level  needed  to illuminate the neon, you are
  seeing the high negative spikes at work.   If  you  still don't believe it,
  lick your finger and put it across pins 13 and 14, provided that you aren't
  wearing a pacemaker!   Now,  CAPTURING that energy and using  it  to  self-
  energize something is the prize!  CUL Joel

  In an earlier  message,  I described how to create large spikes which could
  be seen as they ionize a plasma tube.  If anyone built this device, you may
  want to go on to the next step, which  is to connect a second NE-2 from the
  relay's pins 1  to  pin 14, the ground.  You will find an  EQUAL  AMPLITUDE
  spike coming from the contacts, which is occurring at opposite times as the
  inductive kick.  With  this,  it  should  be  possible  to  energize a xfmr
  primary with a center tap on pin 14,  and  the inputs to pins 1 and 13, and
  have a complete circuit.  This is both the original kick,  as  well  as the
  current-free potential which Bearden and others have described.  Enjoy.
