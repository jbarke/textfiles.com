I really like the way Mr. Hasslberger thinks, that mathematic extrapolations
are just so much fluff because they do not reflect in reality by experiment.
Just as Tesla said.

VORTEX - THE NATURAL MOVEMENT

Physics, the science which should be explaining to us how the universe came
about and what it consists of, seems to have arrived at the end of a blind
alley. Its descriptions of the origin and the workings of our universe get
more and more complex, less and less agreed-upon and they are definitely not
going to accompany us into the 21st century. We are at the beginning of the
space-age. In order to survive in that new age, we need clear and unequivocal
descriptions of physical phenomena.

What I see as the most grave shortcoming of establishment physics is its
adamant refusal to investigate or at least accept the possibility of a
creative life force. There is also a one-sided emphasis on entropic,
(explosive, radiative, centrifugal) phenomena in physics and consequently also
in current technology, to the almost total exclusion of the constructively
ordering, non-entropic phenomena such as brought about by implosion and
centripetal or vortex motion.

The descriptive language used by physics is mathematics. It is adequate to
describe a number of observed phenomena, but depending on what phenomenon is
to be described, physicists conveniently switch mathematics, thereby changing
their whole frame of reference. There is no one theory that can adequately
describe all the forces known to exist and the search for a unified field
theory is running into serious problems.

The trouble is not where physicists commonly look. It seems to be more a
question of philosophical or religious outlook. Our view of nature was
conditioned first by the great philosophers of ancient Greece and then, for a
long time, by the orthodox religions prevalent in current western
civilization. Ironically, the physicist who denies the action of a creator,
just by this very denial limits the scope of his investigations. He has become
"inversely religious", which to an independent scientific investigation is no
less limiting than the stand of the dogmatic religionist.

So it might be that progress in our time has become dependent again on
philosophy, on that science of thinking, of looking at basics and drawing
conclusions that is unencumbered by the specialization so prevalent in the
physical sciences.

The following is a speculative description, in simple terms, of the basic
workings of the universe.

THE NATURE OF LIGHT

Light sometimes behaves as a wave and sometimes as a stream of particles. The
wave theory seems to be confirmed by the observation of interference patterns
and the separation of light into colors after passing through a prism, while
other phenomena validate the particle (corpuscular) theory. This paradox is so
far unresolved and has given rise to a theory proclaiming that light has a
dual nature, in other words that light may be both particle and wave at the
same time.

Although photons, in reverence to this theory, are generally thought to be
"massless particles", there have been research results indicating a rest-mass,
although very small, for photons.(1)

WAVES

It would appear that travel over great distances from a substantially point-
like source, requires light to have a wave configuration. Particles, such as
photons, could hardly be travelling through the immense reaches of space
through which we can observe the light of distant stars and galaxies. Imagine
all of the immense "ball" of space within the range of visibility of a source
of light, such as a star, being actually filled with particles emanated by
that light source. The expenditure in terms of mass, even assuming a very
small mass for each single photon, would be tremendous. The stars would be
exhausted in a relatively short time.

So in order to travel interstellar distances, as light and all other
electromagnetic waves evidently travel, they must be waves and not particles.
To allow this travel, a medium through which these waves proceed, has been
postulated. It has been called various names and has even been "cancelled" by
some scientists who argue that since no one has so far been able to detect
this medium, it does not exist.

Whatever may be the view of the scientific establishment, space is not empty.
The "background" of space might variously be called ether, sea of energy,
tachyon field or primordial energy field(3). It is against this background,
which so far has eluded our direct observation, that electromagnetic waves
propagate.

This space background or primordial energy field has a very high energy
density.(4)(5) It has been described as an immense field of pure energy,
comparable to a "fluid" that fills all space. This field has so far been very
elusive and no direct detection or measurement has been possible. However in
November 1980, Japanese physicist Shinichi Seike reported that he had
succeeded in proving the presence of this high energy tachyon field in
space.(6)

It is this space background that gets excited in wavelike motions by the
source or emitter of radiation. Radiation waves propagate in spheric form, in
all directions from the source. An analogy in a two-dimensional frame of
reference is the surface of a body of water, on which waves propagate in
concentric rings. In our space background, we have concentric shells or
spheres of wave propagation.

The speed of propagation of these waves is determined by the medium of
propagation and is what we call the "speed of light". There is no particular
reason for this speed to be either finite or constant. For example, if in the
path of an electromagnetic wave we add to the background field a physical
medium that allows the passage of light (such as glass or water), the speed of
propagation changes for the duration of passage through the medium, but once
the additional medium has been passed and the wave travels once more in the
background field alone, it will resume its "natural" speed, the speed of
light, as conditioned by certain parameters peculiar to that background field.

PHOTONS

When light is directly observed, it is always in the form of photons, that is,
tiny particles that will strike a sensitive surface such as our retina or a
light-sensitive instrument and determine a certain reaction, called perception
or instrument "read".

When we observe light indirectly, we often see interference patterns, which
indicate that the light propagated in the form of waves. How is it possible,
that one moment light seems to be a wave and the next a stream of particles?

To comprehend this, we must revolutionize our concept of what is mass and what
is a particle. In my view particles are nothing more than local
irregolarities, local self sustaining "tornadoes" in the background field of
space. The properties commonly associated with particles such as mass, inertia
and solidity arise out of the movement, the spin, of these tiny tornadoes. A
similar view has been put forward by Tewari with his Space Vortex Theory.(7)

One fundamental kind of particle, and probably the buildingstone of all other,
more complex particles, is the photon. A photon is postulated to be the result
of the collision of an electromagnetic wave of a certain wavelength (light
spectrum) with an impenetrable barrier, such as a material object. The impact
causes a local disturbance of the background field that can be perceived by
the human eye and by our measuring instruments.

So light, in order to be observed at all, has to necessarily hit a barrier
that will transform the wave into a particle, or rather into a little spin-off
tornado.

THE FORMATION OF MATTER

Photons have a tendency to combine into aggregates. They will form chains,
which in turn will collapse and form "balls" which physicists call subatomic
particles. Thus electrons, protons and neutrons as well as the various forms
of quarks and leptons, which are observed after smashing atoms in particle
accelerators, may be nothing more than variously configured aggregates of
photons. What we term to be positive or negative charge is determined by
direction of rotation, each subatomic particle being itself configured as a
rotating system and thus exhibiting a certain spin.

Just as photons combine to form matter, forming subatomic and eventually
atomic particles, the reverse may happen. Particles of matter may become
unstable and dissolve, emitting photons or even cause the formation of
electromagnetic waves.

A theory of how matter may form through aggregation of photons has been
proposed by Helmut Hoegl in 1987.(8)

Oldano, basing himself on the work of Todeschini, has done some detailed work
describing the possible geometries of aggregates of the mini-tornadoes or
vortexes that make up matter.(9)

It has often been found that the microcosm and the macrocosm are of a
remarkable similarity in structure and function. Our view of the atom, in
fact, is similar to that of the photon described above. On an even larger
level, we may see the same pattern in planetary systems, in galaxies and - why
not - in the universe itself.  All of these expressions of form as we might
call the accumulations of matter are thus nothing else than trapped or frozen
energy, "solidified" space background medium.

SPACE AND TIME

If energy is contained in the background medium of space and can be converted
into matter through the process of "solidification" of that medium, we must
ask ourselves where space and energy come from.

Here we enter religious or at least philosophical territory. Space itself is a
transcendental reality. It may contain energy and matter, but it has to exist
before these latter two can be introduced. Thus space itself as well as the
energy contained in it, first in amorphous form and then as light, are the
result of creative action.

It is useless to delude ourselves, ascribing original creation to a nebulous
"big bang", because even such a hypothetical big bang would have to start at
least from a concentration of matter and an ever so tiny amount of space,
which in that case would already have to have existed and so the cat bites its
own tail. Without an original act of creation, no universe has so far been
known to exist.

This universe happens to have been created with three dimensions and if we
assume, for mathematical convenience, that there could be more dimensions this
might be true for other universes, but in our present universe, such
assumptions must remain what they are - mathematical conventions.

Even time is not a fourth dimension, although we may mathematically represent
time in this way. In reality, time is associated with motion of energy and
matter through space. It has no independent existence of its own other than as
a convention to measure motion. We measure time by how long it takes our
planet to revolve around its axis and by the length of a complete orbit of
this planet around our sun. In the absence of energy and matter however, space
would be without time.

INERTIA AND GRAVITY

According to Einstein, gravitational and inertial acceleration cannot be
subjectively distinguished one from the other. It would seem logical therefore
to assume that gravity and inertia are two manifestations of one and the same
phenomenon.

Inertia is postulated to be a resistance of matter to movement against the
background of space. The configuration of matter as an accumulation of a
myriad of tiny "tornadoes" (photons) as well as atoms similarly configured and
in constant fluid exchange with the primordial energy field, lets us presume
that there may be a certain resistance of matter against changing position in
space. With increased mass, that resistance or inertia will increase
proportionally.

Once a mass has been accelerated to a certain velocity, it tends to keep
moving at the same speed and in the same direction. The conservation of this
motion is postulated to be the result of a macroscopic vortex in background
space, built up by the motion of the mass, which then tends to maintain that
motion. A visual example of this would be an egg held in a stream of tap
water. If the egg is held by fine strings, it will create a vortex in the
water "downstream" and will be holding its position on top of that vortex.
Another example, always using the medium of water, is the ability of trout to
stand motionless without visible effort in the most fast flowing stream of
water.

Gravitational "attraction" as experienced between large masses and by us
humans on the surface of our planet, is thought to be a pressure phenomenon,
rather than an attracting force. It is caused in a similar way as inertia, by
a resistance against movement relative to the background of space. There may
be an inflow of background field towards large bodies, causing a movement of
background field relative to the surface of such large bodies, which is felt
as gravitation.  This force is stronger near the surface of the mass and
diminishes with increasing distance, the inflow becoming gradually slower or
"thinned out" as distance increases. The close proximity of the large mass
prevents the build-up of a vortex as with inertial motion.

A theory proposed by Nieper sees gravitational effects depending on a partial
shielding effect of large masses against the effects of gravitic pressure
inherent in space background.(10)

Electromagnetic phenomena may also have an influence on gravitation, and may
one day supply the means to engineer gravitation and anti-gravitation. For an
advanced treatise on electrogravitation, I refer to a lecture held in 1988 in
Hull, Canada by Bearden.(11)

MAGNETISM

I propose that magnetism is associated with the spin of a particle or mass and
that the magnetic field is caused by a dual macroscopic vortex in the
background of space, converging on the particle or mass, which polarizes two
separate regions of space into a difference of potential.(fig. 1) What we call
magnetic field lines are not field lines at all, but simply the intervening
space between two poles of different potential, held in place in space by the
source of magnetism. One might also call this phenomenon a distortion or
stress of space background. The electric current induced in a conductor that
cuts "magnetic field lines" is an alleviation of the stress of space
background.

Polarity of magnetic stress is determined by the direction of spin of the
vortex. Magnetic poles repel if the associated vortices are of the same
direction of spin, they attract if their spins are diverse.

Permanent magnets cause the vortices and consequent stress of space fabric by
a permanent alignment of their nuclear spin.

The magnetic field around a conductor in which an electric current flows, is a
consequence of the alignment of the spin of the charges moving along that
conductor,.

Physicists have been looking, so far without success, for a magnetic
"monopole", a magnetic phenomenon that has only a single pole. If magnetism,
as postulated here, is a stress phenomenon, then it is clear why the monopole
could not be found.

Planetary systems, contrary to what is widely believed, are not held together
by gravitation. The orbits of planets are determined by magnetic potentials
built up by the central body. The moon rotating around the earth as well as
the planets in their orbits around the sun are guided and held by magnetic
forces rather than by an equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force.
Such an equilibrium would be inherently unstable. Certainly gravitation and
centrifugal force are present and do have an influence, but what determines
the exact well defined and layered orbits are magnetic forces.

On a nuclear level, the strong force holding atoms together and determining
electron orbits could well be the same magnetic force.

ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA

In summary, we have electromagnetic waves as a wave-like agitation of
background space, proceeding through space in a spherical, shell-like pattern
and generating particles at point of impact.

Gravity and inertial forces are caused by linear motion of a mass against the
background of space.

Magnetism is caused by a macroscopic vortex motion of the space background
itself, polarizing the space background into north and south poles.

These different phenomena are all associated with motion of the space
background or primordeal energy field, various types of motion resulting in
diverse energetic manifestations.

A THERMODYNAMIC UNIVERSE?

The theorists of the big bang would have us believe that the universe is the
result of a super powerful explosion and that it has been expanding ever
since. Even though the American COBE satellite has recently detected
variations in background radiation, big bang theory is far from confirmed. Its
life may have been prolonged by this recent discovery, but the big bang
remains in my view an expression of the attitude of current scientific culture
that excludes a priori any creative or ordering influence in the making of the
universe.

The prime evidence cited for the big bang is the red shift of the light of
distant stars and galaxies. This red shift may very well be due to other
causes. Moretti (12) and others have made a case for re-interpretation of the
red shift.

Another underpinning of the big bang is the second law of thermodynamics,
which asserts that a closed system can only evolve in the direction of a state
of ever greater entropy. The big bang presupposes that entropy in the universe
is on the increase.

First of all, I doubt that the universe can be seen as a closed system, if we
consider the existence of a space background of very high energy density.
Seike gives this energy density as

  E = 8.8 x 108 V/cm.(13)

Wesley has shown that under certain conditions order can be created out of
chaos, that is, that the statistical tendency of stellar systems towards
greater entropy is reversed by gravitational and solar (stellar) energy
playing against a background of free space acting as a giant heat sink.(14)

As recognized by Schauberger and as publicized especially by Baumgartner (15),
motion in the form of a vortex is an essentially creative, concentrating, neg-
entropic motion. This type of motion is used by nature in the creation of
matter, the building up of planetary systems and in the construction and
growth of living (biological) systems. We can get an idea of the forces this
creative type of motion can harness, observing the power concentrated in a
single tornado.

Radiative motion, which we see in the form of explosions, radiation and
centrifugal motion on the other hand, is the destructive half of the cycle of
nature: Creation and destruction. Radiation is associated with decay and
disassociation.

Our present technology and our knowledge in physics is based almost
exclusively on the second half of the cycle, the cycle of radiation and decay.
We see this in the prevalence of explosion type motors, the extensive use of
radiative technology and an almost complete absence of centripetal forms of
motion.

This is severely limiting our understanding and our technical possibilities as
centripetal or vortex motion results in a violation of the second law of
thermodynamics. It has an ordering, a concentrating, a cooling effect, while
centrifugal or radiative motion has an entropic, dispersing, heating effect.

With technology unbalanced on one side of the natural cycle, it is no wonder
that the use of our machinery has a destructive effect on the environment and
on ourselves.

Carnot, basing the laws of thermodynamics on observations of the (steam
engine) machinery available at his time, has developed these laws as a
description of the actions and reactions of that machinery. He did not know
the second half of the cycle of nature, the build-up cycle that uses the
vortex, as no technology had been invented to show him.

Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics have become gospel in physics, in
teaching, in patent offices and so the one-sidedness of our technology has
been perpetuated to a complete exclusion of any alternative neg-entropic
technology. This even goes so far that patent offices refuse to consider
registering inventions that violate the laws of thermodynamics!

CREATION INSTEAD OF BIG BANG

Just as we suffocate all technology based on vortex geometry, we are viewing
with suspicion any theory of the creation of the universe, that is not in
accordance with thermodynamics. In order to explain the origin of the
universe, we thus have to resort to - excuse the term - idiocies, such as the
big bang.

There is continuous creation in the universe. I propose that we should
seriously look at the cycle of creation and destruction as we see it to exist.
This has been described as being a cycle of creation, growth, conservation,
decay and destruction.(16) This cycle may be seen as the cycle of an entire
universe or any part of that universe. It is also the cycle of life forms or
biological organisms.  Once the cycle is completed, it starts anew, the
products of destruction leading directly to new creation.

Out of chaos, the ordering principle (if we want, the life force) creates by
decreasing entropy. This creation goes through a cycle of maturity and
eventually into a cycle of decay through an increase of entropy, closing the
circle arriving once more at a chaotic state.

We can observe this cycle in any biological organism. It germinates or gets
born, then grows up into a mature organism, after which it starts to decay and
eventually it dies.

That same mechanism, I believe, is at work in stellar systems, in galaxies and
in the universe as such. The difference is only in the time span required for
completing the cycle of action. With some observation, we may be able to find
out how it works.
