INTRODUCTION
Background

The original program was called VGIF, reflecting its ability to view only GIF
files. When the program evolved to include other paint file formats, its name
was changed to VPIC. VPIC ver 4.0 and up implements all of the GIF89a features.
See the revision history in Appendix A for latest additions and bug fixes.

Print VPIC.TXT at 17 chars/inch and 8 lines/inch for a handy reference card.
Look at the section titled 'How Vpic Operates' for an explanation of the
differences between VPIC and other viewers, and the advantages and
disadvantages of both types.

IMPORTANT: VPIC requires DOS 2.0 or up to run from current directory, or DOS 3.0
up to run from anywhere. You must configure VPIC for your graphics board using
CVPIC or CONFIG (unless you have an Orchid Designer VGA with 512 K). The WHICHVGA
program will try to identify your VGA chip and amount of display memory.
See CONFIG.DOC.

GENERAL FEATURES
VPIC is a file viewer for EGA, MCGA, VGA and SuperVGA, and has the following
features:
  *  Views the following file formats in EGA, MCGA, VGA, or SuperVGA:
     1. Dr. Halo CUT files (with PAL if present). Not Dr. Halo PIC files, which
        are display adapter specific.
     2. GIF87a and GIF89a files; saves to GIF87a format only since GIF89a stuff
        is mainly animation and text handling enhancements. Saves up to 2 pages
        of comments for GIF89a files.
     3. Deluxe Paint LBM (or IFF) files, regular and enhanced.
     4. MAC files, display only.
     5. Pictor/PC Paint PIC files.
     6. ZSoft PCX files (including 256 color files).
     7. ColorRIX/EGA Paint SCx files, uncompressed only. RIX wont tell anyone
        his compression algorythm, so compressed files can't be done. Use
        RIXLATE to uncompress SCx files that are compressed.
     8. Targa 8 thru 32 TGA files, comressed or uncompressed. Also uncompresses
        Targa files that are compressed (e option while viewing). Now supports
        the Tseng ET-4000 HiColor card in 16 bit color, but file conversion
        options don't work from viewing screen.
     9. Binary Image Files (BIF) from B&W image capture boards.
    10. Microsoft Windows 3.0 Bitmap BMP files, compressed or uncompressed. The
        compression algorythm is inefficient, so for pictures without much
        repetition, uncompressed files are generrally smaller than compressed
        files.

  *  Saves current image to any of the above formats (except MAC, FRA, BIF, and
     IFF) in the current mode (EGA, MCGA, or VGA). Also uncompresses TGA files,
     and converts a color picture to a 64 grey shade image (in VGA mode).

  *  Saves current image to GIF in regular, interlaced, inverted, mirrored,
     or rotated 90 degrees CW or CCW. Great for scans.

  *  Configurable for display boards using the Ahead, ATI, C&T, Everex, Genoa,
     Headland, Oak, Paradise, Trident (TVGA8800BS/CS & TVGA8900), Tseng(ET-3000 &
     ET-4000), Video 7, Western Digital, or Zymos VGA chips (see configuring
     VPIC below). The CONFIG program semi-automates the configuration process.
     If your display board implements the VESA standard (thru BIOS or a TSR),
     this will be autodetected and used regardless of the configuration; the
     only drawback to VESA is you can't scroll down quite as far.

  *  /R option allows an application program to show a file and regain control
     without changing the screen mode.

  *  Viewing mode can be manually selected or auto selected from menu.

  *  Allows you to specifiy a new path from the menu with the [F9] key. Also
     updates menu when files are added or deleted.

  *  Very fast GIF decoding.

  MENU FEATURES:
  *  Mark/unmark files for viewing with [SPACEBAR].
  *  Menu text color setable in configuration file.
  *  [F1] gives help.
  *  [F2] shows marked files like a slideshow.
  *  [F3] gives file size and colors.
  *  [F4] toggles between EGA and VGA mode.
  *  [F5/F6] decrease/increase default resolution.
  *  [F7] Locks current resolution, or selects auto resolution mode.
  *  [F8] Makes multiple GIF images pause for a keypress.
  *  [F9] prompts for new path.
  *  [F10] shows current path for files.
  *  Shows marked files singly or like a slide show.
  *  Handles up to 500 files using mouse or keyboard.

  MOUSE SUPPORT
  * All the above functions are now controllable by the mouse. Click on the
    resolution bar, bottom 2 lines of commands, or files. For the menu screen,
    the left button is the same as enter, and the right button is the same as
    the spacebar. While decoding, the right button aborts; while viewing, the
    left button returns to the menu.
==============================================================================
  VIEWING FEATURES
  *  Help while viewing with / or ? key.
  *  Shows filename while decoding, and [ESC] aborts decoding.
  *  Allows deleting a file (with query) with the [Alt-X] key.
  *  Allows adjustment of picture color and VGA contrast and brightness.
  *  Allows saving the current image as a GIF (many options), PC Paint or
     Pictor, ZSoft PCX, ColoRIX or EGA Paint, Targa 16, Dr. Halo CUT, and
     Deluxe Paint II formats in EGA, MCGA, or VGA.

RUNNING VPIC
Command Format: vpic [[path]filespec][/a][/b][/c][/e][/h][/mN][/r][/v][/w]
                     [/xN][/yN][/z][/?].
  *  The default path is the current directory, and the default extensions are
     CUT, GIF, IFF, LBM, MAC, PIC, PCX, SCx, and TGA.
  *  The /a option starts VPIC in Auto resolution select mode.
  *  The /b option causes VPIC to beep after displaying a file except in slide
     mode or /r.
  *  The /c option gives the current configuration; see 6 below.
  *  The /e option forces EGA mode, to use extended 16 color modes; see 5 below.
  *  The /h option allows the viewing of hidden files.
  *  The /mN locks the video mode to N where N is defined when you run CONFIG,
     and in 3 below.
  *  The /r option returns control to a calling program leaving picture on the
     screen; see 4 below. Calling program must reset text mode (mode co80).
  *  The /v option disables the auto VESA detection and uses the config file
     info.
  *  The /w option wait for a keypress after each image in a multi_image GIF
     file.
  *  The /xN option gives a left margin of N pixels (ie /x20 gives a 20 pixel
     left margin).
  *  The /yN option gives a top margin of N pixels.
  *  The /z option inhibits printing the filename of each file.
  *  The /? option gives a help screen.
  *  If filespec is a filename, the single file will be shown (the default
     extension is GIF).
  *  If path\filespec is a directory, a menu of all viewable files in that
     directory will appear. Otherwise all files meeting the filespec will
     appear. For example, [vpic d:\pics\*.pcx] would give a menu of all PCX
     files in the PICS directory of drive D, while [vpic d:\pics] would give a
     menu of all viewable files in the PICS directory of drive D.
  Options and filespec may be entered in any order. All options except /r, /c,
  and /? work in menu and single file mode. The /r option only works in single
  file mode.
 EXAMPLES OF VPIC COMMANDS
    1. VPIC [path\]filename[.ext] shows the file specified. The default path is
       the current directory, and the default extension is GIF.

    2. VPIC [path\][filespec] to get a menu of all files in the specified path
       meeting filespec (may contain wildcards). The default path is the current
       directory, and the default filespec is any of the viewable files; just
       entering VPIC will give a menu of all viewable files in the current
       directory. Shows whether VGA or EGA and modes supported in upper left
       corner. If Path contains . or .., a filespec must be given (may contain
       wildcards). Thus ..\*.* would give a menu of all viewable files in the
       parent of the current directory.

    3. VPIC /@[path\]slidefile[.ext]  to do a slide show from commands in a
       slidefile. The default path is the current directory, and the default
       slidefile extension is SLD. The path applies to both the slide file and
       all files for viewing (unless a path is given for a file-30 chracters
       max). The slide file should be in the same directory as the viewable
       files. The commands are placed on seperate lines, and consist of either:
       a. A filename (GIF extension and slidefile path assumed) and optional:
          1. Display mode (number) and/or
          2. Animate command (a followed by optional number with no spaces).
       b. A delay (viewing time) spec of the form  d n (space required) where n
          is the desired viewing time in seconds.

       The maximum number of files is 100. The number following the optional 'a'
       is the number of vertical retraces between animation steps. The default
       value is 8 (if no number follows the 'a'). The mode is explained below.

       The default viewing time is 5 seconds if no delay spec is given; a delay
       spec applies to all files following in the slide file until changed. The
       first slide is not delayed the first time it is shown. The default
       viewing mode is whatever would look best.

       VPIC understands comments preceded by a semicolon, blank or comment
       lines, and extra spaces. For example, the following slide file contents
       are understood by VPIC, but not recommended:

       d 20         ;Delay for file1.gif & file2.pcx is 20 seconds.
       file1  1     ;First file in slideshow. File1.gif using mode 1.
          file2.pcx ;This is a ZSoft filename with leading spaces.
          ;This is a comment line with leading spaces, next is a blank line.

       d 10         ;File3 is delayed 10 seconds.
       file3 a30    ;Show file 3, animate at 1 shift every 30 vertical retraces.
          d      15 ;15 second delay file4.gif. Has leading & separator spaces.
       file4        ;Show file4.gif, then do a 20 second delay for file1.gif.

       To end a slide show after the current picture, press any key. [ESC] ends
       it immediately.

       The mode requires a little further explanation. In the above slide file,
       it says to use mode 1 with file1. Modes 1 thru 10 are the VGA (256 color)
       modes, and modes 11 thru 20 are EGA (16 color) modes called out in the
       configuration file. Most display boards only have a few of each type. The
       Orchid Designer has 4 VGA modes and 4 EGA modes in the configuration file.

       The VGA modes are                  º The EGA modes are
        1. 320x200x256     2. 640x350x256 º 11. 640x350x16     12. 640x480x16
        3. 640x480x256     4. 800x600x256 º 13. 800x600x16     14. 1024x768x16

       Thus, the slide file says to show file1 in the 320x200x256 mode, and show
       all the others in the default modes (whatever looks best). The CONFIG
       program lists the modes and their corresponding mode numbers for you if
       you highlight the configuration file for your board.

    4. VPIC /r shows the file and then returns to DOS (or a calling application
       program) with the picture still on the screen in EGA/VGA. It is not
       necessary to change the video mode between viewing each file, but it is
       up to the calling program to reset text mode (mode 3) after all viewing
       is done. The /e and /a switches are valid in this mode.

    5. VPIC /e forces and EGA display with VGA to use extended EGA modes.

    6. VPIC /c prints the current configuration of vpic. You can configure VPIC
       to your display board using the CVPIC program and a text configuration
       file describing your board.

    7. VPIC /a starts VPIC in auto resolution mode.

    8. VPIV /b causes VPIC to beep after a file has been fully decoded. Lets you
       know when the viewing options are available. Doesn't beep in slide mode
       or when using the /r option.

    9. VPIC /h allows VPIC to find and display hidden files. Great for those
       R or X rated files you don't want to be normally accessible. This option
       doesn't appear on the help screen.

    10. VPIC /?  gives a help screen.

COMMANDS IN MENU MODE
Keyboard Commands in Menu Mode

1.  The [up], [down], [right], and [left] arrow keys move the cursor around the
    menu of files. [PgDn/PgUp] goto next/previous page. Pressing a key goes to
    next file starting with this character.

2.  Pressing the [SPACEBAR] marks a file for viewing or slides, and moves to the
    next file; it will also unmark a previously marked file.

3.  Pressing [ENTER] will display the marked files in the order they were
    marked. If no files were marked, pressing enter displays the file at the
    cursor.

4.  Pressing [F1] will bring up the help screen; any key will return to the
    menu.

5.  Pressing [F2] will do a slide show of marked files until a key is pressed.

6.  Pressing [F3] will display the file size and colors on the next to last
    line.

7.  Pressing [F4] will toggle between VGA and EGA modes.

8.  Pressing [F5/F6] will decrease/increase the default resolution for files
    larger than 320x200 in VGA.

9.  Pressing [F7] goes to LOCK, which forces the default resolution (above) no
    matter what the file size. Pressing F7 again goes to AUTO, which
    automatically selects the resolution to display the picture. Pressing F7
    again goes back to to the normal default mode.

10. Pressing [F8] toggles the wait mode, where VPIC waits for a keypress between
    multiple images in a GIF file.

11. [F9] prompts for a new path\filespec, and displays a menu of the files in
    the new path meeting the filespec.


12. [Alt_X] prompts if you want to delete the file at the cursor. [Y] deletes
    it, [N] or ESC doesn't, and all other keys are ignored.

13. Pressing [ESC] ends the program and returns to DOS.

14. Pressing [Ctrl-Break] or [Ctrl-C] will get you directly to DOS.

All other keys are ignored. If errors are encountered, an error message appears
on the third line from the bottom, and disappears when the cursor is moved. The amount of
far memory available is also printed on the same line. The menu title is the
search spec.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS IN VIEWING MODE (except in slide mode)
NOTE: The file conversion options won't work when viewing a Targa with the Tseng
      ET-4000 HiColor card in 16 bit color modes (640x350 thru 800x600).

*   The up/down arrow keys will scroll the picture if longer than the screen,
    provided you have sufficient display memory. The [PgUp] and [PgDn] keys will
    scroll by 10 lines. The Video 7 extended VGA boards do not supported writing
    to non-displayed memory or scrolling pics larger than the screen, so this
    function is disabled for these boards.

*   If the picture size is <= 1/2 the screen width, pressing [2] will give a
    double size image (which may be scrollable) and pressing [1] will give the
    normal size again. For VGA, the picture will be changed only in the
    horizontal direction; this will unsquash some 320x400 pics so the aspect
    ratio is correct.

*   Pressing [+] will increase the resolution (320x200 to 640x480, etc).

*   Pressing [-] will decrease the resolution; useful if 800x600 rolls.

*   Pressing [/] or [?] gives a help screen of commands available while viewing.

    Note: All the following conversion options check if the default filename is
    present, and prompt for a new name if it is. They create a file on the
    current drive and directory with the same dimensions as the file being
    viewed, and let you know what is happening while the conversion proceeds. If
    you screw up at the new filename prompt, hit [Ctrl-C] to escape immediately
    to DOS; this will usually preserve a file you don't want to write over. The
    safest bet is to view files in another directory, since the new file is
    saved to the default directory, which is the drive and directory you ran
    VPIC from. I put VPIC in my UTIL directory, and have my PATH set to include
    UTIL, so I can run VPIC from any drive or directory.

*   Pressing [A] will 'animate' a picture by rotating the palette periodically.
    This is especially effective on fractals, where large areas tend to be the
    same color. Pressing [SPACEBAR] will pause the palette rotation, and
    pressing [ENTER] will terminate it and return to the command mode. Thus, by
    waiting for an especially nice pattern and then pressing [ENTER], the
    pattern can be written to a file using the above file save commands.
    Pressing [ESC] will return to the menu. The rate of palette rotation can be
    increased/decresed with the up/down (slow) or PgUp/PgDn (fast) arrow keys.

*   Pressing [B] will convert a color VGA picture to a 64 shade gray picture.
    The resulting image can be saved with the gray palette. Only works in VGA.

*   Pressing [C] will create a Dr. Halo CUT file with the same filename and
    extension CUT. A palette file (.PAL) will also be created.

*   Pressing [E] will expand a Run Length Encoded (RLE) compressed Targa file. If
    the file is not a Targa or is already uncompressed, this key does nothing.

*   Pressing [F] will prompt for a new filename to overlay on the existing
    picture. It also prompts for x and y offsets (in pixels). The colors may not
    be exactly correct since the new picture uses a best match to the palette of
    the original picture, and some colors may be missing. This feature is handy
    for building composite pictures; ie, four 320x200 pics on a 640x400 screen
    with the screen size 'locked' using F7 or /m on the command line. Specify
    where you want to place the first picture on the command line when VPIC is
    executed using the /x and/or the /y options; the filename display is
    suppressed using the /z option on the command line. Alternatly, you can have
    have an all black picture as the first picture, then overlay the others onto
    it. The composite picture can then be saved in any of the file formats VPIC
    supports. You can also specify the /mN resolution mode from the command line
    to lock the video mode to the desired composite size; it can be changed once
    you are in the menu. Later pictures use the first pictures palette (if all
    are 256 color), so it's a good idea to pick the first picture with the
    widest range of palette colors; this gives the best rendition of the other
    pictures. A good way to invoke vpic for this mode is `vpic /x0 /z /m3'.

*   Pressing [G, I, M, U, <, or >] will create a GIF file on the default drive,
    and prompt for a new filename-the default extension is GIF. [G] is for
    non-interlaced, and [I] is for interlaced, [M] is for mirror image, [U] is
    for upside down (inverted), [<] is rotate image 90 degrees CCW, and [>] is
    rotate image 90 degrees CW.

*   Pressing [P] will create a PC Paint or Pictor file. The default extension is
    PIC, and for EGA it prompts for a PC Paint or Pictor file.

*   Pressing [R] will create a ColoRix file with the same filename and extension
    SCx where x is a function of the screen size. If in EGA, will prompt if you
    want an EGA Paint or ColoRix file.

*   Pressing [T] will create a Targa 16 file with the same filename and
    extension TGA.

*   Pressing [W] will create a Microsoft Windows Bitmap file. The default extension
    is BMP and it prompts for a compressed or uncompressed file.

*   Pressing [Z] will create a ZSoft (PC Paintbrush) file with the same filename
    and extension PCX. The file will be in whatever mode you are currently using
    (EGA or VGA). The VGA palette will be correct for the latest version of PC
    Paintbrush, which saves a VGA palette in the file.

*   [Alt_F] displays current filename momentarily.

*   Pressing [Alt-X] will prompt you to delete the current file. If you answer
    [y] it will be deleted, [n] or ESC it won't, and all other keys are ignored.

*   Pressing [ENTER] will return to menu or DOS, or show next file for marked
    menu mode.

*   Pressing [ESC] will end the display and return to the menu.

*   The following keys control the picture tone as follows:
    [F1]       Decrease red content of picture.
    [F2]       Increase red content of picture.
    [F3]       Decrease green content of picture.
    [F4]       Increase green content of picture.
    [F5]       Decrease blue content of picture.
    [F6]       Increase blue content of picture.
    [F7]       Decrease contrast of picture (VGA only).
    [F8]       Increase contrast of picture (VGA only).
    [F9]       Decrease brightness of picture (VGA only).
    [F10]      Increase brightness of picture (VGA only).
    [Alt-F10]  Restore original palette after you thoroughly mess up the colors.
    [V]        Reverses the current palette (16/64 EGA only); interesting effect
               especially for black & white images.

    After a little experimenting, a 'washed out' VGA picture can be greatly
    improved by using [F1-F10] , and you can always start over by using
    [Alt-F10]. To retain a black background in a VGA picture, the brightness
    should be decreased when the contrast is decreased. If you have really
    improved the picture, you can then save it any of the supported formats.
    VPIC will prompt you if the file exists in the default directory, and you
    have the option of overwriting it or giving a new filename. This works
    really well with images created on the Sharp, Howtec or Targa scanners.

All other keys are ignored. Pressing [Ctrl-Break] or [Ctrl-C] will go to DOS.

DECODING OTHER FILE FORMATS

The file decoding works in whatever mode you are presently using (VGA or EGA)
and at the resolution you are viewing with. This way, if you choose to save to
another file format, it will be in the same mode you are viewing with (EGA,
MCGA, VGA, or SuperVGA). The decoding for other than GIF is not as fast as could
be done, but the added versatility more than compensates for this. For example,
EGA PCX files can be very quickly decoded to EGA, but are in the wrong format
for VGA, and considerable manipulation is required to produce a VGA image. For
all formats except GIF, the method of viewing is to decode to a buffer for a
single line at 1 byte/pixel, then copy this line to the display in whatever mode
you are using. This is a compromise for most file formats, since they are geared
to EGA or VGA, and display time suffers, but it makes the code much simpler.
Besides, the other formats are supported mainly to allow easy conversion to GIF,
which is the preferred format for storage, since it gives the smallest file
size. This will also make EGA <-> VGA conversions possible, which is not
supported by most paint programs.

The TARGA viewing uses a fixed palette to speed up the decoding, so the picture
does not have what could be called good color. It is mainly there to verify that
an image is present. Use Image Tools TGAPIC to get an equivalent GIF picture
with excellent color rendition.

ADDED FEATURES

VPIC is meant to fill a void not covered by paint programs, and to allow very
convenient file viewing and conversion between file formats. It is not meant to
compete with the paint programs, and in general if a paint program does
something well (such as resize a picture to fill the screen or cut out a portion
of the picture), VPIC will not attempt to do it. On the other hand, if you think
of a feature which would enhance VPIC, please let me know, and I will consider
adding it to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
1. The ATI 1024x768x16 mode uses 2 pixels/byte, unlike any other VGA or EGA
   mode. It is supported for most viewing and conversions, but will not view or
   convert to EGA Paint files, ColoRIX EGA files, or Pictor EGA files, since
   these are on an EGA plane basis.

2. If you have a board with the Trident TVGA 8900 VGA chip, do not run MAMODE
   before running VPIC, or run MAMODE 64 if you were in a 128K bank mode.

IMPORTANT: Support for boards with other VGA chips: VPIC will support other VGA
boards with extended VGA modes if the owners will write me with the details of
how to set the various modes, and how to bank switch the display memory. Of
course, if you also register VPIC I will give the problem more consideration.

The bank switching Info for some of the 'not so common' VGA boards is hard to
come by, and is needed if VPIC is to support extended VGA modes for these
boards. A VGA board needs to bank switch for extended modes because there is
only a 64K window in the PC address space for graphics memory (from A000 to
AFFF), and extended modes require more than 64K of memory; 640x480x256 requires
307200 bytes of memory, or about 4.7 'banks of 64K'. Bank switching is a means
of mapping the (A000 to AFFF) graphics address space into 64K chunks of actual
display memory. The method of bank switching is determined by the VGA chip used
on the display board, and what I need is info on how to switch banks and how to
set the various modes the board supports. The use of a display board would also
help, since it will allow me to test the program with that display board instead
of 'programming blind'.

HOW VPIC OPERATES - VPIC decodes a picture file directly to screen memory on
    your  display card. The other technique is to decode to CPU (normal) memory
    and then copy the picture (or a portion of it) to screen memory. Both ways
    have their advantages and disadvantages.

DECODING DIRECTLY TO SCREEN MEMORY (LIKE VPIC).

ADVANTAGES -  This method offers the best speed, since it doesn't  have  to  go
    thru the intermediate step of decoding to  CPU  memory first.  It will also
    always decode large pictures,  even above  the  maximum display size. The
    CPU method  usually  doesn't  have  sufficient memory for large pics, like
    1024x768x256, or even  800x600x256 if you have any TSR's in memory; these
    pics require 1 byte/pixel.

    The file conversion options uses the current palette data and the current
    data in display memory to make the new file.  Thus,  what you see is what
    you get in a new file format,  in  whatever  mode you are viewing (256 or 16
    color).

DISADVANTAGES - Because the picture is decoded  directly to  screen  memory,
    any picture data beyond the right edge of the screen is thrown  away. For
    this reason, you can't  scroll  left  and  right.  VPIC  will continue to
    decode to display memory beyond  the  bottom  of  the screen until:

        1.  It runs out of memory, set by BANKS in the  configuration file.

        2.  If the card does not  wrap  this  memory  back  onto  the displayed
            screen, like  the Video 7 cards.

    Thus, if your display card meets the above criteria,  you will be able to
    scroll up and down.

    If the screen doesn't display the whole  picture,  any  converted file will
    be truncated on the right edge to the screen size.

DECODING TO CPU MEMORY FIRST

ADVANTAGES - If there is sufficient CPU memory to hold the whole picture (at 1
    byte/pixel), a rectangular area equal to the screen size  can be copied to
    display memory,  which allows you to scroll around  the picture in all
    directions.

DISADVANTAGES - If there is not sufficient CPU memory, most of the programs
    will refuse to display the picture.  There is also the wait while  the
    picture is decoded to CPU memory before you get to see it.

support, documentation, and configuration files. It may be used for a ten day
free trial period. Regardless of how the copy is obtained, it is requested that
all users comply with the following licensing/registration provisions if they
continue to use it after the 10 day trial period:

    1.  $1/copy royalty if used as part of a DEMO; a demo is not part of your
        product, but is a means of advertizing your product. The maker of the
        demo should be a registered user. If a recipient of the demo uses VPIC
        for other purposes (not part of the demo) he should register.
            You should sign a royalty agreement with me, and make payments
        annually. You may estimate the yearly usage, and then correct it from
        year to year. You should supply to me a written statement listing the
        copies shipped each year.

    2.  $15 per copy for individual users. Users can fell free to use VPIC for
        anything. I need your name and address for my records, and you are
        entitled to:

        your name, but can fell free to use VPIC for anything. Update requests
        and technical support would be thru you (since I don't know the names of
        the individual users) and would be distributed by you to the users.

    5.  Clubs, schools,  universities and other non-profit organizations may
        license VPIC for $45.00 per 6 copies. All users would be registered
        collectively under your name, but can fell free to use VPIC for
        anything. Update requests and technical support would be thru you, since
        I don't know the names of the individual users, and would be distributed
        by you to the users.

    For foreign orders, please send a check drawn on a US Bank, International or
US Postal Money Order, Travelers Checks, or cash, since the banks here charge
$25 collection fee for foreign checks.
    For all the above, VPIC should be distributed intact, with all documentation
(DOC files), support programs (CVPIC, CONFIG, and WHICHVGA), and configuration
(.CFG) files. Archived form is OK to meet this requirement, since it minimizes
disk space, if you supply the un-archiving program.
    A user may install VPIC on more than one machine, provided he is the only
user on each machine. The registration and license policy is similar to a book,
which can be taken with you but used only by you.
    Please use the enclosed registration/order form since it allows me to keep
better records and keep up with the newer VGA boards. 

UPGRADES FROM PREVIOUS PROGRAMS AND UPDATES
    You may use all updates free once you have registered VPIC. If you are
already registered for VGIF or ZS (any version) you may upgrade to VPIC for an
additional $5. Since VPIC is updated regularly, I do not send notices, but it
gets around quickly to most graphics oriented BBS's, and is available at
Compuserve in DL3 of the PICS forum.

ORDERS FROM ME
    If you order VPIC, an upgrade, or an update from me, please add $5 ($10
outside the USA and Canada) for materials, postage, and handling. As a bonus; I
will fill the rest of the disk with good pictures. Please specify 360K or 1.2Meg
disk (I don't have 3.5" disks) and EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA (640x480x256, etc) so
I'll know what pictures to send. I have three 1024x768x256 pictures, but each is
about 700K in size and eats up a sizeable portion of a disk, so if you want one
of these there wont be much room for other pictures. If you want additional
disks of pictures, please add $5/disk. I have quite a few 640x480x256 pictures
(mostly by Boris Vallejo), only 1 disk full of 320x200x256 pictures and 1 disk
of EGA pictures, and a few larger sizes.
    Even if you can't read a 1.2 Meg disk, I would recommend getting VPIC on
that size, since you get about 1 Meg of picture files that way. Then, have a
friend (or computer store) copy the files to your disks.
    Data on the various file formats VPIC supports is available free if you
request it with your order, but will use about 200K of disk space.
    Please use the enclosed registration/order form since it allows me to keep
better records and keep up with the newer VGA boards.

                APPENDIX A - REVISION HISTORY

History of the original VGIF program.

VGIF ver 1.1   1-13-88
    *  Added test for EGA adapter.
    *  Fixed menu colors.
    *  Allow [ESC]ape from marked file viewing.
    *  Added [Ctrl-Break] or [Ctrl-C] exit to DOS anywhere.
    *  Added 'disk full' notification when creating picture file.
    *  Added critical error handler for 'drive not ready' errors.

VGIF ver 1.2   1-15-88
    *  Changed name to VGIF.
    *  Slide mode now ignores the end of file mark in slide file, and any key
       will now end slide mode.
    *  Added slides to menu mode if [S] pressed-shows marked files as slides
       until a key is pressed.

VGIF ver 1.3   1-21-88
    *  Added better error checking to GIF file decoding. Notifies if bad GIF
       file.
    *  Fixed error reporting bug in single file mode.

VGIF ver 1.4   2-9-88
    *  Added instantaneous screen update in slide mode from menu or command
       (SLD) file.
    *  Added the /r option which allows an application program to call VGIF
       to view a file and then regain control.

VGIF ver 1.5   3-2-88
    *  Added [PgUp] and [PgDn] keys to scroll by 10 lines at a time.
    *  Added a max pic height of 819 lines so EGA buffer would not overflow.
    *  Greatly improved color reproduction for 'problem' pictures (such as FROG,
       ARCHIT, PUFFIN, VEGTABLE, etc). These pictures typically have more than
       16 colors. Selected colors on basis of frequency of use where possible.
    *  Fixed following bugs:
       1.  Line buffer would overflow into other variables if pic width was
           > 640 pixels, causing strange results.
       2.  Didn't recognize the end of image marker correctly. This would
           cause the palette to change when the image was done.

VGIF ver 1.6   3-11-88
    *  Fixed a bug in handling multiple images. First noticed when viewing
       WHIMMI.GIF.
    *  Use same palette for multiple images, and get best color match.
    *  Added [L] and [S] commands while viewing a picture. These allow you to
       create full size paint program files.

VGIF ver 2.0   3-26-88
    *  Added the ability to view long GIF files ( > 819 lines) without
       wrapping the display.
    *  Added the [C] and [H] (Dr. Halo) file creation option while viewing.
    *  Added the [L] and [S] prefixes to paint program file creation commands
       while viewing to save long pic files.
    *  Added the Info and Help commands in menu mode.
    *  Deleted the # requirement to specify a directory from the command line.
       The program now looks for a directory which meets the spec on the command
       line. If none is found, it assumes the spec is for a single file.
    *  Added [F1 - F10], and [V] palette control keys while viewing a file.

VGIF ver 3.0   5-2-88
    *  Added VGA capability, and support for Tseng extended VGA modes
       (640x480x256 and 800x600x256).
    *  Determines and displays available modes for your system.

VGIF ver 3.1   5-11-88
    *  Fixed a bug in dir/file spec from command line. Now accepts
       VGIF d:\dir\*.gif or VGIF d:*.gif, although the [\]*.gif is not required,
       since this is the default filespec.

    *  Fixed a bug in forced EGA when doing slides, where an interlaced pic
       displayed at double size would have a 'venetian blind' effect.

    *  Changed so pics larger than 320x200 are shown in 640x480 VGA; can get
       800x600 by pressing + key.

    *  Note that EGA mode on the Orchid VGA card appears squashed vertically.
       This is normal, and cannot be corrected without reprograming the
       parameters for mode 16, which would change the vertical retrace
       frequency, and probably cause your monitor to roll.

VGIF ver 3.2   5-26-88
    *  Added 500 file menu, and assy language text screen updating; now
       super fast.
    *  Fixed a bug which caused the Vega VGA card to hang up.

VGIF ver 3.3   6-9-88
    *  Added user spec of video mode for non-Orchid VGA boards.
    *  Added GIF and Pictor save of current screen for VGA/EGA pics.
    *  Added prompts to screen for conversion to other formats.
    *  Removed conversion starting at first visible row-now does whole pic.

VGIF ver 3.4   6-23-88
    *  Fixed a bug in the GIF save routine.
    *  Added color, contrast, and brightness adjustment in VGA.
    *  Fixed a bug in menu mode for marked files.
    *  Added /n command line option to stay in 640x480x256 for VGA pics.

VGIF ver 3.5   7-14-88
    *  Fixed some misc minor bugs.
    *  Added increase/decrease resolution command while viewing 16 color VGA
       pics (using the /e option).
    *  Added slide mode for VGA.
    *  Added lock mode option to start pics from the menu in a desired mode.

VGIF ver 3.6   8-8-88
    *  Fixed some bugs.
    *  Fixed EGA slide show.

VGIF ver 3.6A  9-10-88
    *  Fixed 1024x768x16 mode.

VGIF ver 4.0   10-20-89
    *  This was a beta test version which got out. It had lots of bugs, which
       were fixed in VPIC.

History of VPIC

VPIC ver 1.3    2-2-89
    *  Fixed cursor in menu.
    *  Fixed 'lock up' if GIF header size wrong (640x350 labeled 350x640).
    *  Now pauses pic if file error and waits for key press-can see partial
       pics in bad files this way.
    *  Shows GIFs with MAC headers (1st 128 bytes are not GIF standard);
       if F3 (info) pressed shows if file has a MAC header.
    *  Fixed so views and saves new ZSoft VGA PCX files which include
       palette at end of file. Still doesn't load PAL files.
    *  Fixed ZSoft file displays and saves.
    *  Added Wait toggle (F8) which pauses between images in multi-image
       GIFs, and allows conversion to other filetypes.

    *  Added hit [ESC] while decoding to abort picture.

VPIC ver 1.5   3-23-89
    *  Fixed bug in 'Escape while decoding' which would hang system.
    *  Fixed EGA x2 display for interlaced files.
    *  Fixed problem with saving a pic after scrolling.
    *  Fixed palette in animate, so save will use current palette.
