============= 2400B HAYES MODEM COMMANDS LIST =============



Here is a list of the S-registers used by Hayes modem. Please be aware
that not all modems support these registers and that some modems may
have more registers than are listed.

ALL S REGISTER COMMANDS ARE ENTERED IN THE AT COMMAND LINE.
EXAMPLE: AT S8=2 S2=43 S7=30
TO READ THE VALUE IN ANY REGISTER USE
         AT SX? <CR>
THE MODEM SHOULD ECHO THE VALUE FOUND IN THE REGISTER X
