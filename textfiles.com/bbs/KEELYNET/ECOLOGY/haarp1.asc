SUMMARY:
                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

 1. Field of the Invention

This invention relates to generation of a Artificial Ionospheric Mirror
(AIM), or a plasma layer in the atmosphere. The AIM is used like the
ionosphere to reflect RF energy over great distances.

 2. Description of the Related Art

In the past, the technique of using the ionosphere as a mirror to reflect
radio waves, or RF energy, has given Ham Radio operators the ability to
send transmissions over long distances. This technique has also provided
radar systems the ability to look "over the horizon." Variations and
fluctuations in the ionosphere, however, can render the effectiveness of
such communications uncertain. Thus, the desirability of creating
controllable plasma layers in the atmosphere for communications purposes
has been recognized. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. **4,686,605** issued
to Eastlund and U.S. Pat. No. 4,712,155 issued to Eastlund et al.

Previous experiments directed toward creating plasma layers for
communications have suffered from the inability to control the inclination
of the plasma layer so that signals could be transmitted and received from
various ranges. In other words, while one could create a plasma layer in
the atmosphere at a lower altitude than the ionosphere, point to point
communications would be limited in range based on the reflection angles of
the transmitted and reflected signals.

                  SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION

In view of the limitations of the related art it is an object of this
invention to generate a plasma layer that could be angled or tilted with
respect to the horizon in order to affect signal transmission range.

The present invention provides a system and method for generating a plasma
layer at controlled altitudes and inclinations that acts as an artificial
ionospheric mirror (AIM) to reflect RF signals. The AIM increases the range
and predictability with which RF energy may be reflected off the AIM for
communications purposes. More specifically, a tiltable AIM is created by a
heater antenna controlled in phase and frequency. The heater antenna phase
shift scans a beam to paint a plasma layer. The heater antenna continually
refocuses at a higher altitudes by frequency shifting to tilt the plasma
layer.

DETDESC:
            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

 FIG. 1 illustrates the creation and use of An Artificial Ionospheric
Mirror (AIM) for tracking aircraft and reflecting radio waves. A heater
antenna 1 radiates power causing avalanche ionization or breakdown
releasing free electrons in the atmosphere to generate the AIM 2. The
heater antenna 1 is an array which can be used to focus energy at varying
altitudes and elevations to tilt the AIM 2 using phase and frequency
control. The AIM 2 simulates the ionosphere 3 which is also used to
detect "over the horizon targets" 5. In addition, the AIM 2 can reflect
radio signals transmitted from a transmitter 6 to a receiver 7 over long
distances.

 A typical heater antenna is shown in FIG. 2. It consists of an array of
multiple active radiating elements 10 having their individual phase and
frequency controlled from a control module 12. The radiating element 10
is used here to represent all possible antennas, including, but not
limited to, dipoles, slots, small or large horns, log-periodic antennas,
large parabolic reflectors, etc.

 FIG. 3 shows the spatial relationship for a focused heater array. To
have the electric fields from all of the array elements focus, or arrive
in phase at a distance R.sub.o in the near field of the array, it is
necessary to correct the phase of each element to compensate for the
phase delay difference from the center element due to the additional
phase path W.sub.ij. If R.sub.o is much larger than the maximum D.sub.ij
in FIG. 3, then the phase delay can be approximated in wavelength to be:

 W.sub.ij =(D.sub.ij).sup.2 /(4*R*g)                        (1)
where g is the wavelength of the heater frequency. Equation 1 is referred
to as the quadratic phase error. If this error is less than g/8 when the
element (i,j) is on the outer edge of the array, then the distance
R.sub.o is said to be in the far field of the array.

 In order to focus the array at R.sub.o, it is necessary to have several
wavelengths of phase error from the outer elements of the array. That is,
the term "focus" is used in this context to mean that the electric field
from the array is concentrated in a desired spatial region.

 FIG. 4 shows the degree of focusing that can be accomplished. This is a
vertical pattern of an array whose elements have been phase shifted to
focus at 60 Km. The array has 400 elements with a total width and length
of 2000 g. The peak of the pattern is determined by the 1/R.sub.o.sup.2
dependence.

 The AIM ionization layer is created by using this focused power to
ionize an area in the atmosphere, as shown in FIG. 5. The microwave
breakdown of air occurs where free electrons gain enough energy from an
electric field to generate additional free electrons until no more can be
generated, thereby resulting in avalanche ionization, or breakdown. This
causes the generation of a plasma layer 21. For example, a pulse of power
from the heater begins to propagate in the z direction shown in FIG. 5.
As the field propagates, more free electrons are generated. A breakdown
point descends vertically from the focal point of the propagating field
giving thickness to the ionized layer, or plasma layer, until all
ionization stabilizes. This "clamping" creates a thin vertical plasma
layer.

 Simulation results show that when an array 20 is focused at a point 22,
electric field power peaks at the focal point. Simulation results shows
that given a focused microwave source avalanche ionization, or breakdown
will occur at a power level 3-10 dB below the focal point power level.

 To create an AIM, the heater array is focused at a desired altitude to
maximize power at a point and thereby generate plasma. The heater antenna
then "scans" the phase of each array element to move the focal point.

 FIG. 6 illustrates creation of a noninclined AIM layer. The heater array
30 is first focused at point 31. The heater array scans horizontally by
phase shifting to a point 32 creating an avalanche ionization line 33.
Next, the heater array scans from a point 34 to a point 35 creating
another avalanche ionization line 36. The heater array continues this
process to create an ionization plane or AIM layer.

 In order to form an inclined AIM cloud, each new ionization line must
occur at a slightly higher altitude. By altering the phase or frequency
of the array elements, the focal point can be moved up in altitude, as
described below.

 FIG. 7 illustrates creation of an inclined AIM. The heater array 40 is
first focused at point 41. The heater array scans along the x direction
to point 42 to generate avalanche ionization along line 43. Next, as in
creation of a non-inclined AIM, the heater array scans along the x and y
directions directly below point 44. The heater array 40 alters either
phase or frequency to refocus to a higher altitude in the z direction to
the point 44. The heater array then scans along the x axis to point 45 to
create the avalanche ionization line 46. The heater array continues this
process to create a tilted ionization plane or tilted AIM layer.

 FIG. 8 shows that the preferred method of generating a plasma layer uses
a heater antenna to scan with a line rather than a point. Scanning using
a line is preferred since an AIM can be created in the atmosphere in less
time. To create lines of ionization rather than points, a rectangular
array 50 is used. In the array 50, radiating elements are focused only
along the plane of the long dimension of the rectangular array, creating
a line of ionization 53. The array is then scanned along the x-y axis and
in altitude along the z axis to create another ionization line 55. More
ionization lines are similarly generated to form a tilted AIM layer.

 In order to create a tilted AIM it is necessary to refocus the heater
array at successively higher altitudes. Moving the focal point by
changing the phase of each element of the heater in a very precise manner
is not practical. Moving the focal point away from the initial location
requires changing the phase on each element. The phase change required is
near the rms tolerance level, typically 1 degree. FIG. 9 shows the
required phase corrections to move the focal point from 60 Km to 61 km.
Elements 5, 10, 15, and 20 have distances 5d, 10d, 15d, and 20d,
respectively from the center of the antenna, where d=25 meters It is
clear from FIG. 9 that it is impractical to alter numerous antenna
element phases to move the focal point to create tilted patches for AIM
applications. 2000 elements may be required here to generate enough power
to ionize the atmosphere.

 The second method of refocusing is accomplished by first setting the
phases of all elements for the initial focal point and then moving the
focal point by changing the frequency rather than the phase. This
frequency chirping method is less precise, but easier for hardware
implementation because precise phases for 2000 elements need not be
changed. FIG. 9 shows the required phase corrections to move the focal
point from 60 Km to 61 Km. FIG. 10 shows that the focal point can be
moved 100 meters by increasing the frequency approximately 1 Mhz. The
resulting focal point power levels are not completely optimized, but
simulation shows that there is less than a 0.1 db difference between the
frequency shifted peaks and those obtained by phasing.

 Tilting the AIM using frequency chirping is practical to achieve in a
real system. FIG. 11 shows the plasma layer location with no frequency
having 400 elements or more grating lobes can be kept down by 20 db or
more from the focal point.

 The degree of focusing depends on the ratio of focal range to aperture
size. The half power width from peak "V" can be approximated as:

 V=2*g*(R.sub.o /L).sup.2                                   (2)
where L is the length of the array which is assumed square for equation
2. The power gradient at the half power point "grad(P)" can be
approximated as:

 grad(P)=10/V(db/meter)                                     (3)

For an AIM it is desirable that the power gradient be high because this
directly determines the gradient of the electron density of the generated
ionized cloud. The electron density must be high to avoid RF losses
caused by absorption. Hence V be small, preferably less than 2 Km. A
heater frequency of 300 MHz and a focal distance of 70 Km would project
an aperture size greater than 2 Km. Note in equation 2 that array size
scales with the square root of frequency.

 Since a near field antenna is required, the near field of the heater
antenna may be required to extend to reach distant points. This is
accomplished by increasing the array size. It may not be economically
feasible to fill this entire aperture with elements, hence a thinned
array is utilized.

 If a thinned array had its elements uniformly distributed, there would
be many grating lobes in the radiation pattern of the array. These
grating lobes can be eliminated by randomly spacing elements. However,
random spacing puts power from the grating lobes into the average side
lobe level. If no new elements are introduced when the aperture is
increased, then the peak power of the main lobe remains constant and the
main lobe receives less of the total power as its beamwidth decreases. In
order to preserve the efficiency of the heater array, grating lobes must
be utilized in creating the AIM cloud or the array can not be heavily
thinned. FIG. 15 shows an array with uniform spacing having grating
lobes. FIG. 16 shows an array with randomized spacing which eliminates
the grating lobes.

 Although the invention has been described above with particular
reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood
that modifications and variations are possible within the spirit and
scope of the appended claims.

HAARP FACT SHEET

"HAARP", an acronym for "High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program",
is a project having the goal of studying fundamental physical principles
which govern the region of the earth's atmosphere known as the ionosphere.
It is through this region that earth-based communications and radar
transmissions must travel to reach satellites or to probe solar and
planetary bodies; and conversely, for radio signals from outside the
immediate environment of the earth to reach its surface. It also is from
these ionized layers that radio waves reflect to achieve over-the-horizon
communication and radar systems. The proposed research will be undertaken
using high power radio transmitters to probe the overhead ionosphere,
combined with a complement of modern scientific diagnostic instruments to
investigate the results of the interactions.

HAARP would be constructed at auroral latitudes in Alaska. A unique feature
of the research facility would be a high power high- frequency radio
transmitter with the capability of rapidly steering a narrow beam of energy
toward a designated region of the sky. Similar, though less capable,
research facilities exist today at many locations throughout the world and
are operated routinely for the purpose of scientific investigation of the
ionosphere. In the US such systems are located at Arecibo, Puerto Rico and
Fairbanks, Alaska. Other installations are at Tromso, Norway; Moscow,
Nizhny Novgorod and Apatity, Russia; Kharkov, Ukraine and Dushanbe,
Tadzhikistan. None of these existing systems, however, have the combination
of frequency capability and beam steering agility required to perform the
experiments planned for HAARP.

A congressionally initiated effort, HAARP is being managed cooperatively by
the Air Force and Navy. The Air Force is responsible for oversight of the
environmental process, site acquisition, and implementation of scientific
instruments associated with the facility. The Navy is responsible for
procurement of the primary contract to design and construct the high power,
high-frequency radio transmitter. Users of the HAARP research facility
would include civilian entities such as universities and the National
Science Foundation (NSF) as well as military agencies such as the Air
Force, Navy, and Advanced Research Programs Agency (ARPA).

Value of Ionospheric Research

The layer of earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere begins approximately
35 miles above the surface and extends out beyond 500 miles. In contrast to
the atmosphere close to the earth which is composed of neutral atoms and
molecules, the ionosphere contains both positively and negatively charged
particles known as ions and electrons. These ions and electrons are created
naturally as a result of the action of the sun's radiation.

This ionized gas of the ionosphere behaves much differently from the
neutral atmosphere closer to the earth. A major difference is that radio
signals passing through the ionosphere may be distorted, totally reflected
or absorbed. For example, communication links from the ground to
earth-orbiting satellites can experience fading due to ionospheric
distortion; an AM radio signal sometimes can reflect, or "skip , from the
ionosphere and be heard at locations hundreds of miles distant from the
broadcasting radio station; the characteristic fading on the high-frequency
(HF) or "shortwave" band is due to ionospheric interference. Because of its
strong interaction with radiowaves, the ionosphere can interfere with
communications and radar surveillance systems, which depend on sending
radiowaves from one location to another.

Investigations to be conducted at the HAARP facility are expected to
provide significant scientific advancements in understanding the
ionosphere. The research facility would be used to understand, stimulate
and control ionospheric processes that might alter the performance of
communication and surveillance systems. This research would enhance present
civilian capabilities because it would facilitate the development of
techniques to mitigate or control ionospheric processes. Ionospheric
disturbances at high latitudes also can act to induce large currents in
electric power grids: these are thought to cause power outages.
Understanding of these and other phenomena is important to maintain
reliable communication and power services. Other civilian applications from
the program's research could lead to improved local and world-wide
communication such as satellite communication. Furthermore, and possibly
more significant, is the potential for new technology that could be
developed from a better understanding of ionospheric processes.

DoD Involvement

Potential applications of the HAARP research include developing DoD
technology for detecting cruise missiles and aircraft and for communicating
with submarines. Although HAARP is being managed by the Air Force and Navy,
it is purely a scientific research facility which represents no threat to
potential adversaries and would therefore have no value as a military
target.

HAARP Transmissions

HAARP would transmit HF radiowaves in a narrow beam, pointed upward to
interact with the ionosphere. The beam would be several degrees wide,
depending on frequency, and thus would influence a region several miles in
diameter in the lower ionosphere, expanding to several tens of miles in the
upper ionosphere. The transmissions would be accomplished through the
design and construction of a world-class ionospheric research instrument
(IRI).

Ionospheric changes produced experimentally by the IRI would be similar to
phenomena which occur under natural conditions. However, nature operates on
a much larger scale, and for a much longer duration, than would the IRI.
The effect of the IRI would be temporary only; the ionosphere would return
to its original state within a matter of seconds and there would be no
lasting changes.

Because most of the energy of the high power radio beam would be emitted
upward rather than toward the horizon, potentially hazardous values of
radio field strength would not be present at ground level except possibly
very close to the IRI. To prevent human and large mammal exposure to these
near-in fields, an exclusion fence would be constructed.

The upward-directed IRI main beam could be sufficiently strong potentially
to interfere with electronic equipment in aircraft flying nearby. To
preclude this possibility, an aircraft detection radar would be interfaced
with the operations center of the IRI, to automatically turn-off the high
power transmissions should aircraft be detected flying on a route to pass
through the radiowave beam.

The IRI would be constrained to operate within the 2.8 - 10 megahertz (MHz)
band on a clear-channel, non-interference basis. Theoretical calculations
indicate that interference with television, AM and FM radio, ham radios,
cellular phones and/or satellite dishes possibly may be anticipated, in
addition to the possibility of interference with HAARP's own radio
equipment. The Air Force and Navy are committed to a mitigation program
that includes acquisition of equipment to minimize out-of-band
transmissions; properly orienting the IRI array to reduce signals emitted
toward local population centers; adoption of operating procedures,
including beam steering, to reduce the percentage of time large signal
levels would be transmitted toward large cities; employing special
techniques such as null placement; and working with complainants to reach a
mutually satisfactory solution. A smaller, less powerful, IRI will be
constructed as a demonstration prototype to ensure mitigation techniques
will alleviate possible interference.

HAARP Facilities

The major components of the main HAARP research facility would include the
IRI, the combined Operations Center & Diesel Power Building, and a number
of scientific instruments used for data- gathering, termed "diagnostics",
placed at various locations on the HAARP site. The IRI would consist of an
antenna array and associated transmitters, operated from a control room
within the Operations Center. The diagnostics would be used to observe the
natural parameters of the ionosphere as well as the experimental results
with the lRI operating.

The antenna would occupy a rectangular area roughly 1000 ft x 1200 ft and
would consist of a 12 x 15 array of antenna masts, each supporting two
horizontal crossed dipole antennas, stacked one above the other. The masts
would reach a maximum height of 72 ft and would be constrained by guy
wires. It is anticipated that the masts would sit on individual piles;
gravel fill between the rows and columns of masts would permit access by
maintenance vehicles.

While some of the diagnostic instruments would be collocated with the IRI
at the research facility, others, due to data collection requirements, must
be located off-site at some distance from the IRI. One of the primary
on-site diagnostics would be an incoherent scatter radar (ISR) which would
transmit radiowave signals in the 430 - 450 MHz band. The ISR would be a
120 ft diameter radar dish supported by a 25 ft diameter pedestal.

The combined power demands of the IRI and ISR would be roughly 12 megawatts
(MW). The method of power supply has not been finalized; however, the use
of diesel generators is under consideration.

Design and Construction

As the result of a competitive procurement the Air Force and Navy have
awarded a contract to ARCO Power Technologies, Inc. (APTI) for the design
and construction of the IRI and associated support facilities. The IRI
design was selected while considering both cost and environmental impacts.
The current schedule anticipates construction at the Gakona site would
begin November 1993 and conclude the fall of 1994 with the demonstration
prototype. Construction for the full-size IRI is anticipated to begin early
1995 and conclude late 1997.

Site Location

As part of the environmental decision making process, Gakona and Clear AFS
were considered as alternative sites for the HAARP facility. On 18 October
1993, a Record of Decision (ROD) was signed by the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, selecting Gakona, Alaska as
the site for the HAARP Ionospheric Research Facility. The ROD signing
follows the Air Force preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement
evaluating the potential environmental effects of the HAARP facility.

Use of Local Resources

The prime contractor, APTI, has indicated that they anticipate use of
Alaska-based companies in constructing the facility. Green Alaska, ARCO
Alaska, Inc. and AHTNA, Inc., are among the companies bang considered.

Postconstruction Operations of the HAARP Research Facility

Since HAARP is to be devoted to ionospheric research, which typically is
conducted during a series of research campaigns, it would be used
periodically rather than continuously. Campaigns would be scheduled four or
five times a year, and typically would involve 10-15 visiting scientists
conducting experiments at the site over a two-week period. During research
campaigns the scientists will depend on the local economy for food, lodging
and other necessities. Maintenance and security functions would be
performed by local personnel, who would reside off-site. The HAARP research
site is being planned for a life of approximately 20 years.

Environmental Process

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) the Air
Force has prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS), with the Navy
as a cooperating agency, to evaluate the consequences of constructing and
operating the HAARP research facility in Alaska. State and federal
environmental regulatory agencies were consulted to identify issues which
are addressed in the EIS. Additional input was solicited from the public
during scoping meetings held in Alaska in August 1992. Topics addressed in
the EIS include, but are not limited to, electromagnetic and radio
frequency interference, vegetation, wetlands, wildlife, air quality,
subsistence, cultural resources and the ionosphere.

The Air Force prepared and distributed to the public and to specific
organizations a draft EIS on 12 March 1993. During the subsequent 45-day
public review period the Air Force held public hearings, at both Glennallen
and Anderson, Alaska to solicit input on the draft EIS. All reasonable
questions and comments received by 25 April 1993, the end of the public
review period, were addressed in writing in the final EIS, which was
released to the public on 15 July 1993. The Air Force signed a Record of
Decision on 18 October 1993 selecting Gakona, Alaska as the site for the
HAARP Ionospheric Research Facility.

In addition to the NEPA process described above, the Air Force and Navy
would comply with all applicable state and federal regulations for
construction and operation of the HAARP facility.

IS HAARP A STARWARS WEAPON?

Defending against enemy missile attacks and other imagined threats has
generated futuristic and science fiction sounding proposals better known as
Starwars. Concepts and ideas circulated wildly throughout government,
military and civilian circles. As the former Soviet Union broke up, the
backing for U.S. Starwars efforts evaporated and the spending on such
projects was dropped. But not soon enough. Many experimental starwars
research projects are still funded and being pursued by the military.

HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), being constructed
for the Air Force and Navy by an ARCO subsidiary, is such a project. Touted
as scientific research, HAARP is a thinly disguised project to "perturb"
the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of energy to see what military
uses it can serve. According to the HAARP RFP, these energy beams will be
used to "control ionospheric processes in such a way as to greatly enhance
the performance of C3 systems (or, to deny accessibility to an adversary)."
That sounds like a weapon to this writer. Other such projects go by the
code names BIME, RED AIR, CRRES, EXCEDE, CHARGE IV, WISP, ACTIVE, HIPAS,
RADC, AIM, etc..

Nuclear bombs exploded in high altitude tests in the late fifties and early
sixties by both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. caused weather and jet stream
changes that lasted almost 20 years. Do the HAARP heaters offer the same
potential as they "perturb" the ionosphere? The ionosphere is home to many
beneficial natural phenomena among them filtering the sun's harmful rays
and reflecting radio waves used for communications. Although not totally
understood, the ionosphere also directly effects the weather systems and
the jet streams.

HAARP, "the most powerful facility (of its kind) in the world" is currently
under construction near Gakona, Alaska. Other smaller ionospheric heaters
of this type are already in operation in Norway, Ukraine, Russia,
Tadzhikistan, Puerto Rico and Fairbanks (yes, right here in Alaska). Could
tests and experiments with these ionospheric heaters already be changing
global weather systems? Could they be a contributing cause for the floods
in the U.S.? Could this be the kind of secret weapon that Zhirinovsky
speaks of? Can these heaters change the earth's magnetic fields as well and
cause equal reactions half-way around the globe? Will we need to protect
ourselves from the sun's rays due to new holes in the ionosphere? What will
happen to the individuals living near HAARP when it operates, will they be
exposed to unnecessary risk of electromagnetic radiation?

Some of the specific language in the HAARP documents is quoted below and on
the next page:

"The HAARP is to ultimately have a HF {High Frequency} heater with an ERP
{Effective Radiated Power} well above 1 gigawatt {1,000,000,000 watts} (on
the order of 95-100 dBW); in short, the most powerful faci!ity in the world
for conducting ionospheric modification research."

"The Soviets, operating at higher powers than the West, now have claimed
significant stimulated ionization by electron-impact ionization. The claim
is that HF energy, via wave-particle interaction, accelerates ionospheric
electrons to energies well in excess of 20 electron volts (eV) so that they
will ionize neutral atmospheric particles with which they collide. Given
that the Soviet HF facilities are several times more powerful than the
Western facilities at comparable midlatitudes, and given that the latter
appear to be on a threshold of a new "waveparticle" regime of phenomena, it
is believed that the Soviets have crossed that threshold and are exploring
a regime of phenomena still unavailable for study or application in the
West."

"A key goal of the program {HAARP} is the identification and investigation
of those ionospheric processes and phenomena that can be exploited for DoD
purposes, such as outlined below.

Geophysical probing to identify and characterize natural ionospheric
processes ... so that techniques can be developed to mitigate or control
them.

Generation of ionospheric lenses to focus large amounts of HF energy ...
thus providing a means for triggering ionospheric processes that
potentially could be exploited for DoD purposes.

Electron acceleration for the generation of IR (infrared) and other optical
emissions ... that could be used to control radio wave propagation
properties.

Generation of geomagnetic-field aligned ionization to control the
reflection/scattering properties of radio waves.

Oblique heating to produce effects on radio wave propagation at great
distances from the heater, thus broadening the potential military
applications of ionospheric enhancement technology.

Generation of ionization layers below 90 km to provide radio wave
reflectors ("mirrors") which can be exploited for long range,
over-the-horizon, HF/VHF/UHF surveillance purposes ....

Why are the citizens of the United States being asked to pay for such a
project? Why do those associated closely with the project reference its use
as submarine communications and other apparently innocuous purposes?

Monster in the Wilderness

by C. Zickuhr

The HAARP project being constructed near Gakona, Alaska will
create the largest-of-its-kind ionospheric heater using computer
controlled radio frequency transmitters. HAARP, which stands for
High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project, is a joint effort
of the Air Force and the Navy. HAARP program manager, John
Heckscher, claims that it is a research project with both
military and civilian benefits yet only military experiments can
be found in the documentation for the project. The acronym
implies something to do with the aurora, but none of the project
papers mention that aspect. What sounds like an engineering feat
deserving of public accolade, has remained suspiciously low
profile, almost unknown to most Alaskans as well as the rest of
the country.

Documents acquired from the Office of Naval Research via the
Freedom Of Information Act reveal a more ominous purpose for
HAARP. According to these documents, the U.S. military believes
the former Soviet Union has similar heaters with which they claim
to have achieved higher levels of ionospheric reaction than
possible so far in the "West". Although smaller in size than the
HAARP project, there are many other ground based transmitting
heaters in operation around the world; Tromso, Norway and
Arecibo, Puerto Rico among them. Can these heaters already be
changing the weather, and have they somehow contributed to the
recent climate-based catastrophes in the U.S? Might migratory
species traveling through the "rays" have already experienced
irreversible damage? How many humans have contracted cancers that
might have remained dormant if not "excited" by these
transmissions? When Russia's Zhirinovsky speaks of secret
weapons, is he referring to their version of HAARP?

HAARP first came to my attention in the spring of 1993, when a
neighbor and airline pilot brought me materials on the project.
The FAA had briefed commercial pilots in Alaska on changes needed
to avoid interference from future HAARP transmissions. As a ham
radio operator, my neighbor assumed that I had some knowledge of
the "giant transmitter" and its effect on other communications.
After making inquiries to other hams, a few recalled seeing
announcements for public meetings in Glenallen and Anderson,
Alaska. Several then attended these Draft Environmental Impact
meetings and gathered information.

FAA personnel, pilots, communications engineers and others raised
serious questions during the HAARP Draft Environmental Impact
Statement process. According to official statements, these
questions were all properly addressed in the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS). Closer examination reveals a different
story. Local FAA engineers, aware of the heavy safety dependency
of airplane communications, voiced strong objections. The
national FAA, however, overrode these objections and gave HAARP
the green light after "assurances" that lower level concerns
would be accommodated. The FEIS admits that all forms of radio
communication are subject to interference, yet completely ignores
the concerns expressed in many of the comments. Individuals,
organizations and agencies that use radio for their day-to-day
livelihood were left with a "let us know and we'll try to
mitigate it" promise. It is important to remember the definition
of mitigation is "to reduce", not "to eliminate". What recourse
does the Alaskan Bush communicator have when their radio
transmissions are rendered useless by HAARP? That is their only
form of communication.

The FEIS and other Department of Defense documents indicate that
interference problems would be too great to allow it to be
located near other military facilities in Alaska. What kind of
monster is it that they can't even locate it near existing
military bases? Even the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) has reservations about HAARP
transmissions. They would only permit one of the test sites
(Mineral Wells, Texas) to operate and so far have declined to
extend all the requested frequency/power privileges necessary for
the Alaska site. The enormous lobbying power of the military may
overwhelm reason and force the NTIA to go along with the HAARP
request. After all, Gakona is a "virtually uninhabited" area of
the world.

Electromagnetic radiation has drawn increasing interest in the
form of health impact studies and research worldwide. The HAARP
project will generate massive amounts of intentional and some
unintentional radiation. The HAARP environmental impact
statements deny possible biological effects on humans, citing
obsolete IEEE standards that basically say if the radiation isn't
causing you to feel heat, it does not harm you. The preponderance
of current studies indicate there can by promotion of cancer
growth, disorientation, and other negative physical effects from
low level, non-heating electromagnetic radiation. Why have our
government agencies given their affirmation to something so
clearly controversial?

After searching for answers to HAARP questions for the past year
and a half, what has surfaced are very few answers and many more
questions. How dangerous is HAARP (some physicists fear severe
planetary consequences)? Commenting on HAARP in the April, 1994
issue of Physics and Society, C. L. Herzenberg says "...this
technology does present issues that need to be publicly addressed
by the technical community". Can HAARP change the ionosphere and
weather patterns?? Can HAARP disrupt worldwide communications??
Can HAARP damage or destroy wildlife?? Will HAARP radiation
change the migration habits of animals that come near it?? Can
HAARP cause cancer?? Can the ionospheric effects of HAARP be
controlled?? Why has the project been kept low profile and
secretive, by the sponsors and the contractor (an ARCO
subsidiary)?

UPDATE: JUNE 1994 - ARCO sold their subsidiary to E-Systems, the
41st largest U.S. defense contractor noted for their counter
surveillance work. Why have Alaska's public officials avoided
providing serious answers to the public's questions?? Anything
that can generate these questions deserves the MONSTER title and
our serious attention.

Additional pieces to the puzzle that have shown themselves only
serve to heighten speculation that we are not getting clear and
concise answers. There is a connection to the recently installed
Cray supercomputer at UAF and to the Geophysical Institute there.
There is an obvious power requirement that might be met by a
proposed coal power plant at Healy, connected by a proposed power
distribution intertie. Some of the experiments will require
"seeding" the ionosphere with chemicals that could be delivered
by rockets from the Poker Flats rocket range near Fairbanks.
Patents held by the ARCO subsidiary building HAARP describe a
similar ionospheric heater and claim abilities to stop missiles,
change weather, and disrupt global communications. The inventor,
Bernard Eastlund, claims he was hired by ARCO to find a use for
their Alaska North Slope gas deposits; hence, his inventions
described in the patents. Microwave News May/June, 1994 reported
Eastlund said "The HAARP project obviously looks a lot like the
first step toward this."

The Gakona location is interesting as it was once destined to
become an over-the-horizon radar facility. The Cold War ended
before it could be completely built. This left the military with
a remote location with buildings and generating equipment
partially completed, and a choice - either restore it to its
original natural condition or find another use. HAARP
conveniently fits the site. Is the choice of this remote site for
these monster transmitters more a factor of fewer people to
complain? Does it reduce the number of humans exposed to HAARP
transmissions thereby reducing the liability? What about the
wildlife in the area, what exposures will they be subjected to?
One need only remember experiments of another era that generated
nuclear fall-out killing and crippling humans and animals in its
path. It only took forty to fifty years to get the agencies
involved to admit liability.

In order to get an idea of just how large the HAARP transmitters
are, imagine all the ham radio operators in the United States
(there are over 500,000) transmitting at their maximum allowed
power from one giant antenna. That still would not be as powerful
as HAARP's multi-gigawatt (giga = billion) radiation capability.
The average Alaskan ham can communicate across the state with
less power than will be in the unintentional harmonics and
side-lobes radiated by HAARP.

What exactly will HAARP do? According to HAARP project documents
it will "perturb" the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of
energy. Using polarized, pulsating radio frequency transmissions
to perform experiments which include devising methods to destroy
the communications capabilities of others (presumably an
adversary) while preserving their own communications. Experiments
with mirroring and reflecting abilities of the ionosphere
(abilities we currently depend on for all forms of communication)
will be carried out to see what military purposes may be served
by the resulting changes. An apt analogy that springs to mind is
that of an inquisitive youngster poking a sleeping bear with a
stick, to see what might happen! What will we do once the monster
is unleashed?

The Alaska location was partially picked for its alignment with
the earth's magnetic force lines. Military experiments with the
magnetosphere also appear to be planned. And again the scientists
warn of possible dire consequences, including setting the earth
into some unexpected vibration or oscillation, similar to an axis
wobble. Many scientists such as Richard Williams writing in
Physics and Society in April, 1988 have denounced this kind of
testing as irresponsible and downright dangerous, fearing long
term negative ionospheric effects. Also, like any magnet, the
force lines will react at their opposite pole, near Australia and
New Zealand. Australians are concerned enough to consider sending
a team to Alaska to document and investigate HAARP. Shouldn't
Alaskans be interested too?

A group of NO HAARP activists is seeking to formalize their
opposition by incorporating as a non-profit organization or
affiliating with an existing group. Their prime purposes will be
to promote awareness, file legal actions and other activities
focused specifically on HAARP, something no group is currently
doing. In fact, probably due to the remoteness of the Gakona
location, it has been difficult to get outsiders interested. We
are quite aware that the promoters of HAARP fully realize that
they have the upper organizational hand and the money to outlast
our grassroots opposition. Those of us in NO HAARP are committed
to doing what we can to stop the project before it comes on-line
with full power in 1997. Considering the project has been
underway since the mid-1980's, this will be a difficult task.
Luckily it was not completely funded as of a year ago. There is
hope that legislative alternatives to stop it may exist as well.
John Heckscher was quoted by Microwave News in the May/June, 1994
issue saying that "money for completion of the demonstration
project is in place . . . but the larger facility would require
additional funding from Congress". Unfortunately, this additional
funding is likely to be buried deep in the DOD budget.

What can you do? Of course you can try to "write your congress
person". The Alaska delegation to congress is noted for their
alignment with the military so don't expect too much action from
them. Send contributions for the NO HAARP effort to Jim Roderick,
P.O. Box 916, Homer, AK 99603. You can lobby with the NTIA to
turn down the HAARP frequency/power request. You can make others
