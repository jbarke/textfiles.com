                          WALTER RUSSEL ARTICLE: SIDEBARS

                                 AN EARLY WARNING

            August, 1954.   "It will not take many years to utterly destroy
       the . . . encircling protective walls which surround this planet and
       protect the earth from burning up by the sun's hot rays."

                              Walter and Lao Russell,
              Newsletter of the University of Science and Philosophy.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

            April 6, 1989.  "Scientists  reported  yesterday  that  for the
       first time they have detected an increase in "biologically relevant"
       levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground  as  a result of
       the ozone hole  over  the  Antarctica.  This is the first indication
       that the depletion  of  ozone.  .   .  is  beginning  to  cause  the
       potentially harmful effect that has long been predicted."

       A RIDDLE WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA

            In a  way,  the  abrupt  emergence  of   Russell's  astonishing
       hypothesis is  in keeping with the peculiar tradition of the ozone

                                      Page 1





       story, a tale  rife  with  riddles  and  ironies.   "One of the most
       striking features of the ozone controversy  [is] the extent to which
       'outsiders' played a crucial role in identifying the  threats to the
       ozone layer." (The Ozone War, page 11.)

            It was  James  Lovelock,  now  famous  as  the  author  of  the
       controversial Gaia Hypothesis, who  first  found  CFCs persisting in
       the stratosphere.  Making  the  historic  measurement   required  an
       ultra-sensitive device.  Unable   to  obtain  any  funding  for  the
       research (he was  dismissed  as  a   "crank"),  Lovelock  built  the
       delicate tool himself, using his family's "grocery money."

            Ironically, Lovelock  thought  the  chemicals  might  serve  as
       useful "tracers" for  atmospheric  study,  and  said they  posed "no
       conceivable hazard."  "I  boobed,"  Lovelock  frankly  admits.   "It
       turned out I was sitting on a time bomb."  (The Ozone War, page 9.)

            Sherry Rowland,  who while on a "fishing trip  for  new  ideas"
       happened to hear   early  rumor  of  Lovelock's  measurements  at  a
       conference coffee klatch, was no  more  a  part  of mainstream ozone
       research than Lovelock.   In  fact,  he  was  not   an   atmospheric
       scientist at all, but a chemist specializing in, of all things,
       the chemistry of  radio-isotopes.   He  and Molina, a young research
       assistant fresh from receiving his  PhD,  never  imagined that their
       study would plunge  them  into  the  eye  of a national  cyclone  of
       controversy.

            If Russell  is right, and manmade nuclear reactions prove to be
       at the root of stratospheric ills, then Sherry Rowland's involvement
       provides one further irony: prior  to his becoming interested in the
       fluorocarbon work that led to the ozone finding,  he  was  funded by
       the Atomic Energy   Commission.    His  area  of  research?  --  the
       chemistry of atoms produced in nuclear reactions.

       RUSSELL THE ARTIST

            The story of how Dr. Russell  came to sculpt his famous bust of
       Edison is an example of his legendary versatility.   At  the  age of
       fifty-six, Russell had  been  an accomplished painter, but had never
       handled clay in his life.  As President  of  the Society of Arts and
       Sciences, he felt  compelled  to make good on a commission  for  the
       bust, which a fellow artist had accepted but was unable to complete.
       He promptly got some clay and wired Mrs. Edison that he would go and
       do it himself  --  akin to a great conductor suddenly picking up the
       violin for an unrehearsed recital.

            "It was a very unwise thing to do, perhaps, because with such a
       great man as Edison as my subject,  I  might  not  have  survived  a
       failure," he later  remarked.   "But  I  never let  the  thought  of
       failure enter my  mind.  .  .  .The inspired belief that I should do
       this thing as a demonstration of my  belief in man's unlimited power
       made me ignore the difficulties that lay in the way.   So  I went to
       Florida with a  mass of clay, but on my way down, I spent the entire
       time absorbed in inspirational meditation  with the Universal Source
       of all inspiration."

            The resulting sculpture was to be one of the great mileposts in
       his career; other commissions followed immediately, producing busts

                                      Page 2





       of Franklin Roosevelt,  General  Douglas  MacArthur,  Thomas Watson,
       George Gershwin and Leopold Stokowski,  and  finally  a twenty-eight
       figure monument to Mark Twain and the famous "Four Freedoms.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       RUSSELL THE SOCIAL REFORMER

            Founded 20 years earlier as an "ethical and moral  movement  to
       bring culture, character  and  the Brotherhood of Man principle into
       world human relations,"  the New York-based  Twilight  Club  brought
       together a network of such luminaries as Ralph Waldo  Emerson,  Mark
       Twain, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Walt Whitman, Edwin Markham and Alexis
       Carrell.  (Alexis Carrell  wrote  Man  The  Unknown  --  a perennial
       favorite in macrobiotic  circles  --  during  his  association  with
       Russell and the Twilight Club.)

            Russell's long  collaboration  with  Thomas   Watson,   another
       Twilight Club member and the founder of IBM, led to the introduction
       of moral standards  and ethical principles in the world of business.
       In his first  of  many  meetings and  lectures  for  IBM  personnel,
       Russell said he was "shocked" with the "jungle philosophy  of  every
       man for himself"  that  then  permeated  the  business world, and he
       effectively replaced the philosophy  of  "business is business" with
       the concept "that  equal interchange of goods and  services  between
       buyer and seller is the keynote of tomorrow's business world."  (The
       Man Who Tapped the Secrets of the Universe, p. 24-25.)

            During the Depression years when so many businesses failed, IBM
       continued to thrive.  When asked the secret of their success, Watson
       replied, "Go talk with Walter Russell."

            Abandoned during  the  WWII  years, the Twilight Club was later
       revived as the University of Science  and  Philosophy  at Swannanoa,
       Virginia.  After Russell's passing in 1963, his work  was carried on
       at Swannanoa by  Lao  Russell,  his  co-equal  partner in work as in
       marriage.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       A LIVING AND DYING UNIVERSE

            Walter Russell often asserted  that  God's  universe "is a two-
       way, not one-way  universe."   The  death  force or  "winding  down"
       principle is familiar  to  us  as  the  force  of entropy, the famed
       Second Law of Thermodynamics.  The  Law  of  Entropy states that all
       systems gradually lose   energy  (that  is,  energy   becomes   less
       organized and therefore   unavailable   to   perform  work)  through
       dispersal of heat; hence, the universe  is  destined  to die a "heat
       death."

            Russell disagreed, and detailed the mechanics  of  an opposite,
       balancing force --  the  life-organizing force, which he also termed
       "generoactive."  This force is the  answer to the riddle of Newton's
       apple, to which Russell alludes in his 1930s Times  letter.   (Years
       later, Buckminster Fuller  coined  the  term  "syntropy" to describe
       entropy's complement.)  Russell also  likened  these  twin forces to
       the charging and  discharging  of  a  battery, or  the  winding  and
       unwinding of a spring.

            How rapidly or gradually a system unwinds after reaching

                                      Page 3





       maturity depends on  a variety of factors, principally its degree of
       balance within its  local  environment.   Thus  the  relaxation  and
       dissolution of life may occur as slow fermentation,  decay,  a burst
       of flame or an explosion.

            "We do not say that a decaying tree, which takes fifty years to
       go back into the ground, is exploding.  If you burn it, however, the
       flame is a  series  of  quick  explosions which will do in two hours
       what Nature intended should take fifty years."
       (Atomic Suicide?, page 23.)

            Central to   Russell's   scientific    conclusions    is   this
       observation: the state  of  rest,  the source from  which  all  life
       arises and to which it ultimately returns, is the "normal" state (to
       which Russell often  refers as God, Mind or Magnetic zero.) In other
       words, it takes increasing effort  to "wind up" into greater density
       (to live), while it takes literally no effort at all,  once a system
       reaches maximum compression,  to  unwind  again  --  to  die.   Most
       significantly, the force   of   the    unwinding/death    phase   is
       proportionate to the  total effort expended in winding  up  to  that
       point.

            For example,  it may take many years of consuming steak and ice
       cream, perhaps along  with exposure  to  chemical  contaminants,  to
       reach the condition  disposing  one  to  bowel cancer.   The  effort
       expended by the   individual,   the   food  industry,  the  chemical
       factories and even the cattle involved,  are  considerable;  at  the
       point of maximum  compression  (when  the  body cannot  hold  itself
       together any tighter)  that  mass of effort reverts into a forceful,
       effortless unwinding.  What goes in, must come back out.

            To arrest the course of the  disease  at  this point requires a
       tremendous, renewed exertion   of  compression  and   life   effort,
       commonly observed as the "will to live" factor or, in macrobiotic
       thought, as the  capacity  to self-reflect and change one's personal
       habits.

            In the case of human illness and dying, such a reversal through
       renewed compression is often possible,  just  as  it  is possible to
       arrest the burning  of  a  tree  with  cold  water,   or   to   slow
       fermentation with salt.   It  is  not  so easy to halt the unwinding
       process of gunpowder, an electrical short-circuit -- or the decay of
       radioactivity.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       THE SPIRAL OF ELEMENTS

            As in the life of his contemporary  Georges  Ohsawa, the modern
       founder of the  macrobiotic movement, Russell was  absorbed  in  his
       later years with  both  the cosmic meaning and the immediate dangers
       of atomic science.   Also  like his  Oriental  counterpart,  Russell
       vividly and brilliantly expressed his grasp of universal dynamics in
       a spiral chart of the elements.

            Russell's atomic charts placed all the atoms as points along
       a continuous spectrum of increasing compression, much like the notes
       of an ascending musical scale.  The musical simile  is  not  casual:
       Russell's atomic scale  is  harmonically  organized in octaves, with
       the inert gases (helium, neon, argon etc.) acting as the "keynote"

                                      Page 4





       of each octave.    (Not   surprisingly,  Dr.  Russell  was  also  an
       accomplished composer.)

            Russell held  that the hydrogen  octave,  far  from  being  the
       beginning of the  atomic  scale,  was  in  fact  preceded  by  three
       "inaudible" atomic octaves,   yielding   a  full  spectrum  of  nine
       octaves.  These first three octaves,  involving wavelengths too vast
       to measure, would be beyond the threshold of physical  sensing (that
       is, beyond detection  by normal instruments of science).  It was the
       lack of this knowledge, Russell contended,  and the misconception of
       hydrogen as the  first  element  that  forced  scientists   to  view
       deuterium and tritium  (which  he had originally called Ethlogen and
       Bebegen -- now well-known as components of the "heavy water" used in
       today's nuclear reactions) as isotopes  of  hydrogen instead of true
       tonal elements in their own right.  ("Isotopes" might be compared to
       the "accidentals" -- sharps and flats -- of single musical notes.)
       On the other  hand,  he  asserted,  that many of the  higher  octave
       "elements" in fact  are  but  isotopes  of higher-octave versions of
       carbon.

            Carbon, lying in the center of the fourth octave, is held to be
       the balance point of perfect stability  and the mature expression of
       the entire spectrum,  and  as such serves as the basis  for  organic
       life.  Russell pointed  out  that roughly 98 percent of organic life
       forms are composed  of carbon and  four  other  elements  (hydrogen,
       nitrogen, oxygen and  silicon) which all are grouped  together  with
       carbon in the  fourth  octave  (except  silicon,  a transmutation of
       carbon in the next octave up, which  forms  the basis of the Earth's
       crust and of soil).  In a sense, the "purpose" of the  entire atomic
       spectrum is to create carbon life forms.

            The further  one  compresses past carbon, the more readily will
       the pressure and  heat  of  compression  explode  into  decay.   The
       supercompressed elements of the 7th, 8th and especially  9th octaves
       (radium, plutonium, etc.)  are  simmering  at  the breaking point --
       hence the tremendously  explosive   pressures   of  the  radioactive
       metals.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       ENCOUNTERING THE RUSSELLS

            On a quiet afternoon in 1979, I sat in a coffee  shop preparing
       my Kushi Institute  lecture for that evening.  As I sipped my coffee
       -- I was allowed to, after all, I was a teacher -- I was interrupted
       by two friends,  both "senior" teachers.   (This  particular  coffee
       shop served as   a   hangout  and  meeting  place  for   macrobiotic
       teachers.)  They joined  me  and began discussing the usual topic of
       the day: How to get everyone else  to  eat  macrobiotically so as to
       establish one peaceful  world.   One  of  the  seniors   noticed  my
       recently acquired book,  Dr.  Walter  Russell's The Secret of Light,
       lying on the table beside me; and  they asked me who Dr. Russell was
       and what the book was about.  After the first few  sentences  of  my
       reply, they both proceeded to criticize both the book and its author
       for a good half hour.

            In the Boston macrobiotic community where I lived at that time,
       I soon learned,  to  mention  the  Russells  and their work was like
       admitting that you  did  not  understand  the  unique  principle  of
       macrobiotics.  The philosophical and scientific works of the

                                      Page 5





       Russells were (and  perhaps still are) considered unclear, confusing
       and impractical.  I, like my fellow students and teachers, certainly
       did not want confusing or "foreign"  philosophical  ideas to disrupt
       our established belief system concerning the nature of macrobiotics.
       As far as we were concerned, the macrobiotic truth existed here, and
       only here, in our little community.  The sun flag was  raised  high,
       and I was  dedicated, loyal, stubborn and very confused.  So, I laid
       the Russells' work aside, along with all else that did not fit into
       my small world of dogma.

            Several years later, being a  little  older,  not necessarily a
       little wiser, but  a  whole  lot  more  curious and frustrated  with
       apparent inconsistencies and     impracticalities    in    my    own
       understanding of macrobiotics, I secretly began to explore the works
       of Dr. and Mrs. Russell.  At first  I became more confused and found
       myself resisting, especially  when I read such bold  statements  as,
       "Opposites do not attract," or "Like attracts like."  Wait a minute,
       I thought.  Maybe my macrobiotic friends were right about Russell --
       there do seem  to  be  inconsistencies here.  I soon discovered that
       the inconsistencies I was encountering  were not in their works, but
       in the limitations of my own prior understanding.   Gradually  a new
       comprehension began to open up.

            Their words  penetrated  deep  into  my soul.  They were honest
       words, words of  wisdom, of love,  and  they  were  steeped  in  the
       unifying principle of macrobiotics.  Their expression  was extremely
       clear and to  the  point.   The message was practical and not at all
       confusing.  There was nothing there to instill guilt or fear.

            They spoke of the difference  between knowing and thinking, and
       how we all know all there is to know, yet do not always  admit it to
       ourselves.  Dr. Russell  was  a perfect example of one who knew.  He
       had very little formal education,  and  used  this to his advantage.
       Through inspiration he    became    an    accomplished    scientist,
       philosopher, artist, sculptor and musician.

            They spoke  of how we as human beings can reinspire others, yet
       can only be inspired by the One.   And  most  of  all,  for me, they
       explained the mechanism and process of the logarithmic spiral -- the
       foundation of macrobiotics.     The    more    I   absorbed    their
       understanding, the more it seemed to add to rather than detract from
       or conflict with my prior macrobiotic learning.

            Through the  years  that  followed I began to incorporate their
       understanding of macrobiotics into  my own teaching and counselling,
       always with the  thought  that I would meet Mrs. Russell  some  day.
       For the past  eight  years  I traveled throughout the United States,
       teaching and encouraging people to  study  the  Russells' works, and
       giving out the address of the University of Science  and Philosophy.
       During this period  I  had  not  once  contacted  the  University to
       introduce myself.  Why?   I have  no  idea.   In  1987  I  moved  to
       Charlottesville, Virginia from  New York.  Why?   I  have  no  idea,
       other than it  seemed  to be the proper move for me.  I soon learned
       that the University of Science and  Philosophy  was  only  a  twenty
       minute drive away.

            I called the University and introduced myself, and said I would
       like to meet Mrs. Russell; I was given an appointment.   Days later,
       I drove out to Swannanoa with John Mann, who had recently relocated

                                      Page 6





       Solstice from upstate  New York to Charlottesville.  [Editor's Note:
       Why had we abruptly relocated?  We  had  no  idea.]  Arriving at the
       requested time, I introduced myself to the staff and  they said they
       would inform Mrs.  Russell  that I was there.  I stood among a group
       of approximately twenty  other visitors  and  watched  as  the  most
       elegant lady I have ever met began to descend the carpeted stairs.

            We had  never  met,  yet  she  recognized  me   in   the  crowd
       immediately, and invited  me  upstairs.  As we sat, she proceeded to
       tell me my life story in detail, from  the beginning to the present.
       She spoke as if she knew me when I was a child.  She  did!  And that
       wasn't all she knew -- for she, too, was a living example of her and
       her late husband's philosophy.

            We spoke  for  a few hours on many subjects.  She told humorous
       stories about Dr. Russell and herself  as  if  he  were still alive.
       "He is!" she said, "You can never die!"  She spoke  with  a  simple,
       quiet conviction that was utterly disarming, and I felt as if I were
       in the presence  of  honesty incarnate.  Meeting Mrs. Russell was an
       experience I will cherish forever.

            Editor's Note: Mrs. Russell was  a perceptive person.  Early in
       our conversation, she looked straight at us again  and  said,  "This
       started in 1954."    She   was   referring  to  the  '54  University
       Newsletter, no doubt; but she spoke  so  emphatically,  Steve  and I
       could not help glancing at each other -- could she  have  known that
       we were both  born in 1954?  She smiled.  Later, she abruptly turned
       to us and  nonchalantly commented,  "You  know,  Dr.  Russell  never
       smoked cigarettes or drank coffee."  Bingo, I thought.  -- Ed.

       RESOURCES

       "Atomic Suicide?" (1957, 304 pp.), discusses the nature of matter
       and its relation to the world of spirit.  It also provides  a  broad
       introduction to Russell's   general   cosmology.    One  fascinating
       section is devoted to excerpts from  the  contemporary popular media
       about the dangers of nuclear power.  A lengthy introduction  by  Lao
       Russell includes a biographical essay on Russell's life.
