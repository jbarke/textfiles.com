                 VampNet Conference Descriptions

************************************************************************

  This file will give you some idea of what VampNet is about; what we
like to talk about, and what types of conversations to expect in each
conference.  It may or may not be helpful in making your decision of
which conferences to echo (G).
  You'll notice that VampNet DOES require aliases for most, if not all,
of it's conferences.  This conscious decision on the part of the Net
Administrators was made to encourage thought-provoking, creative, and
intelligent discussions of some rather offbeat subjects.  It's often
easier to write what you really think and feel about a subject if
you're "incognito".
  VampNet is by no means an "adult access" network, but it certainly
isn't G-rated, either.  PG-13, maybe.  You should read NETRULES.TXT
for specifics regarding what we'd like our guidelines to be, but just
be aware that tolerance is, in our humble opinion, a virtue.
Nevertheless, excessive swearing, graphic depictions of sex or violence
are, shall we say, frowned upon, and probably unnecessary.
  Now, before the entire NETRULES.TXT file is re-written here, on to our
conferences.....

VampNet Admin                                         Alias: Not Allowed
Conference Moderator: Jack Norton                             *REQUIRED*

  This conference is a place for Net Sysops to post suggestions and to
look for any changes in policy that might affect them.  Note the key
words, "Net Sysops".  No one but VampNet Hubs and Nodes should have
access to this conference.
  Hopefully, we'll be able to maintain a casual atmosphere here.  If you
have suggestions, complaints, or whatever, let us know.  Just be nice
about it whenever possible.

************************************************************************

VampNet Sysops                                        Alias: Not Allowed
Conference Moderator: Jack Norton                             *REQUIRED*

  This conference in intended to be a public forum for Net Sysops to
communicate with each other.  Again, the key words are "Net Sysops." As
with VampNet Admin, no one other than Net Hubs and Nodes should have
access to this conference.

************************************************************************



VampNet Chat                                             Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open                                    *REQUIRED*

  Pretty much what the name implies, a necessity for any net to use as a
catch-all for those discussions that don't quite fit any other
conference description.  Enough said.

************************************************************************

Anne Rice & Company                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  What self-respecting vampire afficianado isn't familiar with Anne Rice
and the Vampire Chronicles?  Rice's Interview with a Vampire, The Vampire
Lestat, and Queen of the Damned have reshaped the vampire myth in a way
that no other contemporary horror author ever could.
  This conference is a discussion of Anne Rice, her novels (to include
ALL of her works), her characters - her world.

************************************************************************

Bram Stoker                                              Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Bram Stoker was, in his day, the Anne Rice of today.  His contribution
to literature was, quite literally, to reinvent the vampire - from the
pitiable creatures that they were for centuries in folklore to the
tragic hero portrayed in _Dracula_.
  This conference is about Bram Stoker, the man, his life, and his
world, without whom society's fascination with vampires might never have
existed.

************************************************************************

Count Dracula                                            Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  The other half of Bram Stoker, deserving of it's own discussion.
Dracula, the tragic, romantic hero, has been revived in so many ways
that he certainly will live forever.  From movies and literature to
greeting cards and beer ads; ask any five-year old who Dracula is, and
that child will point to his or her teeth.
  Dracula is a part of our society, and the discussions here will
discuss the how's and why's of his continued existence.

************************************************************************

Cyber Screams                                            Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Judge

  This is, after all, a net.  The combination of vampires and cyberpunk
was inspired largely by a popular RPG published by White Wolf Games; a
postmodern world populated by cyberpunks, and yes.....vampires.  It's a
world of darkness and danger, of high-tech and cold skin.  Thus, Cyber
Screams is born.
  This conference is for netrunners and vampires alike.  Horror and
high-tech, side-by-side in the not too impossible future.

************************************************************************

Dark Shadows                                             Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Who doesn't remember the scariest soap-opera ever to hit daytime
television, or it's ill-fated "renewal" over twenty years after Barnabas
Collins had taken his last victim?
  Dark Shadows has a following that is uniquely it's own, all throughout
the country.  This conference is about the show(s), the actors, the
characters, or anything to do with the world of Dark Shadows.

************************************************************************

Folklore & Tradition                                     Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Everyone knows that garlic and crucifixes are effective tools for
warding off vampires, but where do these customs originate?  Where did
the first vampire come from?
  Vampires myths are almost universal around the globe, and all of them
vary in many ways.  This conference is a discussion of those myths,
traditions, the folklore - anything having to do with the historical
origin of vampires, or the folklore and tradition surrounding them.

************************************************************************

General Arts                                             Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Why a conference on general arts on a vampire network?  Because many
individuals who are interested in vampires are also highly creative,
artistic types of people.  Painters, sculptors, you name it.  And if you
doubt it, take a look at some of the art surrounding the vampire myth.
  This conference is purposefully general in nature, not catering to any
specific artistic discipline.  To do so would require a completely
seperate net (any takers?).  Hopefully, conversations between artists
not covered by the few special arts categories will take place here.

************************************************************************

General Occult                                           Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Nineveh

  While vampire afficianados aren't necessarily interested in the
occult, many are.  It's not such a huge leap, going from a discussion of
vampires to one on astral projection, or other such discipline.
  This very general conference will accommodate a wide variety of
discussions.  And while not everyone will want to post here, it's here
for those who do.
  A word of warning to sysops: This is not a debate conference, but
invariably, you can expect someone at some time with a desire to turn
this conference into a religious debate.  Come to think of it, this
entire net could spawn such reaction (G).  Just want you to be
warned.....

************************************************************************

Gothic Underground                                       Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  While Cyber Screams is a discussion of postmodernism is the distant
future, Gothic Underground is here to discuss the postmodern world of
the gothic/vampire of today.
  This conference is here to discuss the music and lifestyles of today's
youth, many of whom live a very literal vampiric existence.  By virtue
of it's being included, this conference will also no doubt be a
connecting point for many - a place to meet new friends and discuss
their way of life.

************************************************************************

Internet Chat                                            Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Judge

  Anyone who has ever been on the Internet can spend countless hours,
telling others of the wonders that can be found there - people they have
"met", places they have "been", and the friends that they have made.
  This conference is intended to bridge the gap between those who have
been, those who have not, and those who perhaps one day will.

************************************************************************

Modern Music                                             Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  The rhythm of modern music is the heartbeat of the postmodern/gothic
world, and if you listen to just a bit of it, you'll feel it's pulse.
From the vampiric lyrics of Bauhaus, The Cure, Siouxie and the Banshees,
and Concrete Blonde, to the harsh grinding rhythms of Ministry and Nine
Inch Nails, to the angst-ridden voices of Alice-in-Chains, Pearl Jam,
and others, this conference is devoted to a discussion of modern and
postmodern music, both new and old.

************************************************************************

Undead Poet's Soc.                                       Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Poetry is said to be the most perfect and exquisite form of language,
and there are many who practice and follow this art extensively.
Vampire afficianados tend to write rather dark poetry, expressing their
angst in the tradition of Percy Shelly, Lord Byron, and Edgar Allen Poe.
This conference is intended to accomodate modern poetry, as well as a
place to post quotes from the classics.

************************************************************************

Musician's Chat                                          Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Music is such a large part of the Gothic Underground, and many who are
a part of that world are musicians.  Okay, so even those who AREN'T part
of that world are musicians also.....This conference is open to ANY
caller who plays an instrument, or for anyone who ever wanted to.  It's
simply an informal place to hang out, "backstage", as it were, with
others who share an interest in music.

************************************************************************

Film/Vid/Multimedia                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  One of the most obscure, yet exciting of artistic disciplines around
is that created by the independent producer - underground films,
experimental video, or any other type of production.  This conference
is for anyone involved in, or who would like to be involved in film,
video, or other type of production., to include mixed-media.

************************************************************************

Private E-Mail                                           Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Sysops                                  *REQUIRED*

  This conference is intended to provide a private means for users to
communicate with the friends they make on this net.  There are no public
messages in this conference.
  Individual sysops are responsible for moderating this conference-
meaning basically that the net is not used for any illegal activities.
Since all messages are private, anything LEGAL goes here.

************************************************************************

Role Players Corner                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Equus

  There are many excellent role-playing games on the market, and a LOT
of people who play them.  This conference is intended primarily to
discuss the White Wolf vampire and werewolf games (which are appropriate
for this net's theme), but will also allow discussions of other games as
well.  And don't forget the possibility of an active RPG being played
online - many entire nets have sprung up around this idea, and a lot of
callers are doing just that.

************************************************************************

Social Issues                                            Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Social Issues is a conference to discuss exactly what the name
implies.  Departing radically from fantasy, this conference is intended
for bold discussions of how all of us are responsible for making the
world we live in a better place.  Topics might include the morality (or
lack of) of war, racism as a social disease, the aids epidemic, the
homeless, or any number of social issues that affects all of us
directly.

************************************************************************

Vampire Memorabilia                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Collecting things is a hobby to countless thousands, many of whom are
fans of the vampire genre.  From movie posters, stills, and props, to
gargoyles, models, and coffee mugs - the list of collectible vampire
merchandise is as long as it is varied.  Traders and dealers are welcome
here, to share with others bits of the continuing vampire tradition.

************************************************************************

Vampires in Film                                         Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  A conference that is virtually neverending, this is a discussion of
the role of the vampire in film.  From Bela Lugosi to Gary Oldman, and
countless others in between, this conference is open to any discussion
of any aspect of the vampire in film.

************************************************************************

Vamps in Literature                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Another conference with limitless potential:  who could even begin to
tell you how many books, poems, plays, articles, and other forms of
written communication have been written about vampires?  This conference
is open to any aspect of the vampire as a literary figure.

************************************************************************

ThŠ„tre des Vampires                                     Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  Yes, there are vampires in the theater, and this conference is where
anyone wanting to share info on their favorite theatrical performance,
or just find out what's being done where, and by whom.  It encompasses
actors, directors, technicians, or any other aspect of the vampire in
theater.

************************************************************************

Wicca/NeoPaganism                                        Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Nineveh

  This conference differs from General Occult in that it focuses on
discussions regarding a wide variety of earth religions, including Wicca
and Neopaganism.  There are no rules regarding what "is" and what "isn't"
an earth religion, and there will probably be some crossover between this
conference and General Occult.  The difference remains in the focus, and
it will ultimately be up to the conference moderator to keep the callers
on topic.

************************************************************************

Writer's Coffee Shop                                     Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  This conference is for writer's, mainly those into short horror
fiction.  However, like the other conferences, a wide latitude is given,
and so this conference is open to any writer who wishes to post -
fiction, non-fiction, poetry, screenplays, are other disciplines having
to do with creative writing are all valid areas of discussion.  Not a
bad place to just hang out with some friends over a steaming cup o'
java, either.

************************************************************************

Contemporary Horror                                      Alias: Required
Conference Moderator: Open

  This conference was created at the request of callers wishing to
discuss their favorite horror authors.  Originally, it was asked that the
name be "Stephen King and Company," but that proved to be too limiting.
Contemporary horror, then, is for any discussion on any aspect of the
modern horror genre.
