               Intelec Let's You Connect Direct With Net Host! 
  旼컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴커
  쿟hose interested in or already carrying the Intelec Network and would like
  퀃o use the host BBS as their uplink site,  are more than welcome to do so.
  쿍ut if you do, there is a $2/month access fee so we can offest the cost of
  퀅ploading the satellite files to the uplink system. Calling the host would
  쿫e ideal for those interested, since the packets coming down from the bird
  쿪re generated on the host BBS, thus they have the host system's conference
  쿻umbers. Also, the host system is reliable, fast and you do not have to be
  쿬oncerned about "losing your hub". And the fee for doing so is less than 7
  쿬ents a day!  How many other nets permit calling the host system directly,
  쿮ven if you're a node? Here's a breakdown of the rates & payment schedules

  쿔f between 08/01/94 - 08/31/94 頰 $10 pays thru 1994 or $34 pays thru 1995
  쿔f between 09/01/94 - 09/30/94 頰 $32 pays thru 1995 or $56 pays thru 1996

  쿟he totals in the left column are the required,  in the right is optional.
  쿔n other words, as of 09/01 of any year, the following year is required to
  쿫e paid in full as well. We have decided to do this as A) we don't want to
  쿭eal with checks less than $10  and those folks will only have to make out
  쿪 new check few months down the road anyway. And B) so all accounts become
  쿭ue at the same time, so we do not have an accounting nightmare over this.
  쿑or expiring SysOps, the fee is due 12/01, 30 days before the fee expires.
  쿟his fee is in addition to the $35 "application fee" (not current SysOps).
  쿘ake payable to CLIFF WATKINS and mail to P.O. Box 212  Baldwin, NY  11510
  쿥e currently have no CC service for this, but we are working on it.  Also,
  퀃here is a $20 fee for bounced checks, so please be careful.  Payment must
  쿫e in US dollars. If in Canada, please use Postal Money Order Only. Thanks

                What Is Expected of Those Calling Us Directly  
  旼컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴커
    Some things that others have tried that are not expected of you.  Do a  
    mail scan on your system daily. IF a REP packet is generated, it is to  
    be uploaded during that day's event. If there is no REP generated then  
    dialing out is really not necessary for nodes calling the host. But we  
    do have a minimum of once a week  that must be maintained for nodes to  
    call the host system. This is a minimum  to pick up the private forums  
    that do not go out on the satellite. If you are a hub for Intelec then  
    you must call daily, regardless of any REP packet existing or not. You  
    must call in and grab the private forums DAILY. What we have seen some  
    SysOps do is upload mail on (example) the 15th.  Within that upload is  
    mail from their board dated the 10th.  This is not permissable and can  
    run the risk of host privileges being revoked.  That meant that a mail  
    scan was either not done on the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th, or it  
    was scanned on the 10th but the SysOp didn't run his dialout until the  
    15th. Either way, it's not permissable.  That is longer than the land-  
    line method and we are not trying to take a step "backwards" with this  
    new technology.... Again, scan daily and if a REP is created, send it.  
    If no REP exists, have an event that runs at least once a week even if  
    a REP is not there.

                   If Uplink/Upload Fails Event Processing     
  旼컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴커
    If there's a day when our event fails to send the QWK's to the uplink,  
    within the INTELEC.QIF zip file will be the previous days' mail in the  
    format of INTELEC.QWK, INTELEC.QW0, INTELEC.QW1 etc.  This is for easy  
    automation. If you're a hub for Intelec, this isn't an option, you are  
    supposed to call the host BBS  and pick up the lost mail as TODAY.ZIP.  
    Of course though,  Nodes are welcome to call us and pick up lost mail.  
    You must know what the password is  for accessing the satellite files.  
    When calling the host, type SAT at the main prompt for satellite info,  
    password, event "uplink" processing stats, and satellite related news.  
    Intelec Online  maintains the individual packets that you can download  
    from the "main board", if you know the password for these files.  This  
    password is given only to those  authorized  to pull Intelec mail from  
    the bird who are using the Intelec host BBS as their uplink site.  The  
    files are available as TODAY.ZIP for mail that was to come down today,  
    YESDY.ZIP for yesterday's mail,  and DAYB4.ZIP for the mail day before  
    yesterday. This method is ideal for those running automated scripts so  
    that the packet filenames don't change names from one day to the next.
