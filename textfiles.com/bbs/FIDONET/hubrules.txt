    RPGNet HUB and Regionals Rules and Responsibilities
   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   1.  All HUBS should keep a list of those they are feeding, and make sure
       that all their feeds are receiving.  In the event of a problem, that
       you can not solve, you should report the problem to either
       Coordinator, Gerald Kruse (Hienbreck the Horrible) at 100:1313/400 
       (313)675-0912 (BBS) (313)675-7014 (voice) or Jim Long (Mad Dog) at
       100:1313/0 (313)937-9456 (BBS) (313)937-2513 (voice).  ANY questions 
       will be addressed.  I'd prefer you called and took care of it, rather
       than be mystified.

   2.  All HUBS should be running TICK, or an equivelant program.  This means
       you should be passing on the file Echos to your feeds.  RPG_LST (The
       nodelist distribution) is mandatory, and should be sent to ALL FEEDS, 
       regardless.

   3.  All HUBS should have the RPG-App.* file available on their BBS
       for Download.  Please try to help the network.

   4.  No HUBS are allowed to charge their feeds for the service of providing
       RPGNet mail.  If you will not comply, then HUB status will be
       removed.

   5.  Since RPGNet now has over 20 message Echos, it is not required for
       any hubs to carry all the message or file echos, UNLESS ANY NODE
       UNDER the Hub/Regional has a desire to carry that message or file
       echo.  This of course excludes mandatory echos, as all nodes should
       be carrying them.

   6.  The system of sending in new apps is as follows :
           - Any hub or regional, upon receiving an application,
                
                - If the Node is planning/hoping to feed from
                  you, temporarily modify the nodelist, and
                  get things started between the two of you.
                  At that time, you should create a NodeDiff
                  file (that editted section of the Nodelist), 
                  attach it to the application, and forward
                  it to the RPGNet Administration.
                
                - If the node is planning/hoping to feed from 
                  another hub/regional, forward the application 
                  to the RPGNet Administration, or to the appropriate 
                  hub/regional.
                
                - All applications should eventually make their 
                  way to RPGNet Administration.
                
                - All applications received by a hub/regional should be
                  accompied by the appropriate NodeDiff File.
