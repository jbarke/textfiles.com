 1 - FRANKLY, CURT from your Editor Node ID ->MORE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     I have asked for and received the SC's permission to devote space to
an issue which I consider to be important to each of us wandering around
out here in cyberspace.  We are warping around in an electronic frontier:
one whose regulations are not yet firm; and one in which guidelines are
often difficult to obtain.  What we do with modems and messaging and file
transfers and our own sense of the ethical are often acts for which there
is no legal precedent.  Are we publishers or retailers?  Are we subject to
the same freedom of speech and behavior in this medium as in others?

     The CUD407.??? issue of Computer Underground Digest provides details
of this nasty matter (the defense opening statement is included in its
entirety and makes for FINE reading).  We should stop for one moment and
consider:

     Craig Neidorf was indicted by the Federal Government for activities
which it determined, after considerable legal expense on Craig's part, were
unprosecutable.  At the time, Craig was 19 years old and had done nothing
more serious than publish electronically an administrative document
concerning Emergency 911 services.  The case went to trial before being
dropped by the prosecuting attorney.  Craig ended up with over $100,000 in
legal expenses.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation paid SOME and provided
SOME legal support, but he was left with significant debt as a reward for
standing up for principal.  It involves BBSs, electronic newsletters, and
guilt by association.

     A request: read CUD407.???.  Ponder whether you can afford $5.29 (or
more) to help Craig and express appreciation for someone who stood on
principle and perhaps may have reminded the government that it should be a
bit less aggressive in its zeal to "get" folks who do "dastardly" things
with computers.

          "Craig's situation is not simply his own personal
          problem.  He took considerable risks, for which he
          incurred massive debt, to defend the principles in
          which many of us believe.  We are all indebted to him
          for his courage, for his concern for justice instead of
          expediency, and for the way in which he helped focus
          the Constitutional and other issues of cyberspace.

          "Craig needs our help in defraying the costs of a
          battle from which we all benefited.  Even $5 would help.
          Just a 29 cent stamp and a $5 check.  That strikes us as
          a very small gesture on our part to demonstrate
          recognition of his sacrifice.  And the 3 minutes it
          would take to address the check and send it to his
          attorney:

                         Katten, Muchin, & Zavis
                         525 West Monroe Street
                         Suite 1600
                         Chicago, IL 60606-3693

          "And do not forget to write Craig's name in the memo
          section or enclose a letter explaining what the check
          is for.  If you neglect to do that, KMZ will not credit
          his account for the amount of the check."

 3 - AUTOMATED PHONE OPERATORS from Internet RISKS in COMPUTING
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Date: Thu, 5 Mar 92 23:16:04 -0500
>From: olson@husc.harvard.edu
Subject: Risks of Automated Phone Operators (RE: RISKS-13.24)

    Our moderator's comments about the potential fraud problems with AT&T's
operatorless collect-call system reminded me of my one experience with it.
I had to call AAA, for the obvious reason that the car I was traveling in
had decided to fry its clutch, and they tell you to call collect.  The
conversation ran as follows:

Me: [Dial 0 + number]
Pleasant recorded voice: "...If you are making a collect call, please 
press `1-1' now." [or some such]
Me: [Key 1-1]
Voice: "Please say your name."
Me: "Charles Olson"
Voice: "Please wait while we determine if your call will be accepted..."
[brrrring...brrrring.....]
[click]
AAA recording: "Thank you for  | AT&T recording: "You have a collect
calling AAA Emergency Road     | call from [my voice] Charles Olson.
Service.  We will accept your  | If you accept this call, please...
collect call.  If you...

Me: "AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!" [SLAM!]

 4 - BREAK IN!! by Carol Carmichael Node ID ->STRUPPI
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     I knew it was bound to happen:

     Sooner or later someone would try to log on as the SysOp.  Yet, even
when I saw the proof glowing on the screen in front of me in my callers
log, I went into shock!  After the feeling of shock started to fade away, I
began to feel intense rage.  I quite literally saw red.  I saw an attempt
at my privacy being invaded.  And as most of you know - it's not a very
good idea to enrage a SysOp.

     Fortunately when this took place, my trusty Co-SysOp was on-line.  I
immediately broke into chat with him, so I could vent my anger.  As we were
chatting, I also noticed a fellow D.C. area SysOp visiting on the second
node.  The three of us entered a group chat to discuss what had happened
and how we would seek our ultimate revenge on the low-life who had violated
my BBS.

     I was *so* mad that I could not see reason.  I knew someone had
recently tried to hack into my system as me ... I felt violated.  The guys
tried to calm me down, but all I wanted to do was find out who the
slimeball was, confront him/her/it, and then blacklist them from the local
BBS scene.

     The three of us started running every analysis program we could find,
in an attempt to determine who the culprit might have been.  Fortunately,
aided by modern technology, I was able to compare the callers log on the
BBS to the caller-id log.  We were also running password and telephone
number analysis programs to see if any callers were using the passwords
this culprit had tried.

     We were a bit puzzled; there appeared to be a two-minute delay between
the caller-id log and the callers log at the time the culprit attempted to
break in.  Realizing the state I was in, my Co-SysOp called the individual
who was on-line right before the attempted break-in.  He did this very
matter-of-factly, thanking the caller for calling our BBS and verifying we
had correct data in his user record.  All checked out fine and we had a
clear mind that that particular caller did not attempt to break in.

     By this time, about 50 minutes had passed.  I was finally speaking a
little more coherently, but was still very steamed.  While the other SysOp
and I traded comments back and forth in group chat, my Co-SysOp decided to
once more review the callers log entry that documented this attempted
break-in.  For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why - but if it made
him happy, then so be it.

     Well, he came back on line and advised us that he had good news,
interesting news, and depending how I looked at it, bad news.  The good
news was that he was able to narrow down significantly who the intruder
was.  The bad news was this individual was pretty close to me.  The
interesting news was that after closely and carefully looking at all the
pieces in the callers log, my trusty Co-SysOp discovered one pertinent fact
we had all overlooked: the intruder was a LOCAL log on -- there was no
modem connect data!!!  This certainly put a new perspective on things
indeed...

     Before I went rushing off to perform unspeakable acts on the person of
the sole teenaged resident of my house, my two wise and trusting friends
calmed me down enough to get all the facts before grounding the culprit,
erasing all his Chuck Yeager diskettes, and yanking his modem privileges
for life.  My Co-SysOp entreated me to remember that the lad was only a
boy, and no matter how responsible he had been in the past, he was still
only a teenager - prone to do an occasional immature thing or two.  I
promised them I would be cool, calm, and collected... then I'd ground him,
erase all his Chuck Yeager diskettes, and yank his modem privileges for
life.

     Confronting the culprit was a lot easier than I anticipated.  I was
preparing myself for some mad scheme of why he tried to log on as his
MOTHER! He sort of took the wind out of my sails when I confronted him.  He
matter-of-factly advised me, since I harped on computer security so much,
he wanted to see how I'd react when I noticed the attempted break-in and
how long it would take me to figure out it was him!  <harumphf>

     As I'm sure you've imagined by now, my teenaged son had a harsh
realities briefing on computer security and how it's not nice to cross his
MOTHER but his SYSOP as well!

5 - REACHING OUT by Matt Roberts Node ID ->EDSHOME
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     When I first got my Apple computer in 1985, I never realized how
powerful computers were.  I mostly used the Apple for my high school
papers, and I played around with basic programming.  I chose the Apple
computer because I am totally blind, and speech-access products were
available.  After I finished high school, I immediately added a second
Apple computer to use at school.  Two years went by, and I never thought I
would want or need any more computer equipment.

     In September of 1990, my parents bought me a Braille 'n Speak.  The
Braille 'n Speak is a portable computer about the size of a book.  It uses
braille as its input method, using a six key keyboard.  A person reads
material stored in the Braille 'n Speak through its built-in voice
synthesizer.  When I received my Braille 'n Speak, I started playing with
it.  While reading the Blazie Engineering Newsletter, the president, Dean
Blazie, mentioned that the company was going to set up a bulletin board for
Braille 'n Speak users to get technical support.  I knew that I needed a
modem, so I convinced my mother to buy a 2400-baud pocket modem.  In the
meantime, I had met Bob Shuck, the SysOp of Capitol Connection BBS.  The
night I received my modem, I called Bob and asked for access to his
bulletin board.  Since I didn't have a communications program yet, I
planned to use the Braille 'n Speak.  The program arrived two days later
and it was a good thing.  The Braille 'n Speak was very difficult to use on
bulletin boards, because it was difficult to read the current prompt.

     After Bob gave me access, I started playing around with the different
features on the BBS.  I could not download files because the Apple computer
can't handle the ZIP format.  I started reading the different message
bases; now, I was introduced to RIME.

First Encounter with Messaging
     I discovered right away the volume of message traffic on the BBS.  I
started out reading just the main board.  Then one night I got curious
about the Disabled echo, so I started reading that conference.  I was doing
all of this on-line, and being totally blind, I couldn't effectively quote
the messages that I replied to.  I decided to find a way to read the
messages off-line.  I started exploring different methods and finally came
up with a crude way to download and read the mail.

     I used the "RAC" command.  I had selected the conferences, so all I
had to do was type the command, select my protocol, and switch disks when I
was told there was a full disk.  That was downloading mail.  I used a word
processor as an off-line reader, inserting the quoting material manually. I
spent hours laying in bed listening to the voice synthesizer read the mail.
After I finished reading and replying, I'd have to "upload" the replies.
Sometimes the procedures worked, sometimes not.  I used the above method
for about a month, but the mail kept piling up.  I couldn't use an off-line
reader because of my computer's limitations.  I decided to get an IBM
compatible computer and that would solve all of my problems.

     In February of 1991, I received my computer and I began to get the
files I would need.  It took a whole month to set everything up because I
had a speech program that I just couldn't use.  After purchasing a new
piece of software, installing the off-line reader, and downloading some
mail I was ready to get back on RIME again.  Although I have had to leave
twice due to health problems, I am back to stay.

     While reading the RIME News conference one day, I saw a request for
help with the newsletter.  I immediately replied and I was asked to get
involved.  I want to help blind people get the most out of their computers
and the RIME network.  My goals are simple, help where and when I can.  I
am familiar with WordPerfect, SLMR, OLX, MegaMail, Telix, and Flipper.  I
have had fun on RIME so far, and I know I will still be here for years to
come.

     Speaking of mugs Howard, the one I got a couple of weeks ago is
     *defective*... it has a _large_ hole in it and when I turn it over,
     all the coffee *falls out!!!*  It's a good thing that I wasn't near
     the 'puter when it happened, 'cause I'da hafta sood U 4 it!

    To make life easier for the editors, the following submittal guidelines
are suggested:

1)  To be included in the next month's newsletter, all articles must be
    received by the 15th of the current month.

2)  A routed, receiver-only (private) message in the COMMON conference is
    acceptable. Please address and route to: Curt Akin Node ID ->MORE.

3)  Your name as used on RIME.

4)  Your Node ID if you are a RIME SysOp or your "home" board ID if you are

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice: 1. The RIMENEWS Conference (200) is a READ ONLY conference.  Node
           SysOps can force this conference to be read only by adding the
           following line immediately after the EXPORT:
           PKZIP -d <path><nodeid>.RLY *.200
        2. RIME distribution files which used to be identified with MMYY
           in their file names are now identified YYMM.  This change makes
           RIME files appear in date sequence in sorted listings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
