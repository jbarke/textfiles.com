                           August 1, 1996

This is a complete listing of all RIME conferences, listed in order by 
"NUMBER," the international conference (or channel) number.  Your local 
board may not assign the same numbers to these conferences, and it may 
not carry every one.  If a conference below interests you and can't be 
found on your local board, ask your Sysop if it can be made available.

The listing below also indicates if a conference is shared with other 
networks.  Note that those shared networks may not have "Private" or 
"Receiver Only" message capability.  Ask the Conference Host if those 
capabilities are available to the shared network.

The "FOCUS" line indicates the general area of interest for the conference.
Conferences which share the same "FOCUS" would be similar; for example,
all political discussion conferences have the same "social.political" 
"FOCUS."

The message traffic rating, or "ACTIVITY," is based on the latest message
traffic measurement at the NetHub.  Message volume may fluctuate at times.
Here is what the various "ACTIVITY" levels mean:

                    ACTIVITY            MESSAGES PER DAY
                    light               1-10

Description:  As crime increases more and more prisons are 
              being built to house inmates who were previously 
              allowed probation. Estimates run as high as 
              one out of every three persons becoming involved 
              with the penal system in some way *other* than 
              as inmate.   Friends and family members, wishing 
              to be of support to the person going through 
              the criminal justice system, get caught up in 
              its procedures; they are thrown into the world 
              of penology by just VISITING, which can sometimes 
              be mortifying, embarrassing or cruel. This will 
              be a support conference to compare notes, to 
              tell of experiences (good or bad), to share 
              the special anxieties of this unique but increasingly 
              common bond. No one has to reveal who 'their 
              inmate' is, or the relationship.  That's not 
              important here.  And OUTING (revealing who ANOTHER's 
              inmate is) is completely forbidden; this is 
              nobody's business.   What is important is that 
              each participant come away with the knowledge 
              that they are not alone in what they are experiencing.

Description:  A conference dedicated to Beginner, intermediate

              rich programming language, PCB sysops can customize 
              their systems in ways never before imagined. 
              PPL code, while easy to write does require 
              a knowledge of programming, and hints and tricks 
              can be passed down to new comers to the field 
              from the more experienced PPL programmers.  
              More advanced PPL programmers can swap methods 
              that solve even the most difficult problems. 
              There is not a PCB sysop out there that does 
              not take advantage of PPE's, and that will benefit 
              greatly from this conf addition.
