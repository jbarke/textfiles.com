do not allow or have the capability for  *Private* or *Receiver Only*

the Conference to make sure that such capabilities are available.

              requesting a specific file name that they are looking for,
              or post a description of what the file should accomplish.
              Responders would reply to the message with the specific
              file name, and where the user will be able to pick it up.
              This conference would also be open to those hobby
              programmers that would be willing to write a program for
              the user to fulfill the end result.  This conference would
              also help out BBS sysops in that it will help eliminate
              the constant requests from their users regarding the
              searching of files as described above.
