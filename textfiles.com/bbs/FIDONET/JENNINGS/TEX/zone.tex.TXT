I believe Fido/FidoNet starting with 12f's addressing is spiritç
\& letter of the ``law''. It works as follows:
 
I am node 1:125/111. I enter a message to 2:500/1. Fido doesç
this:\par
 
{\obeylines\parskip=0pt
1) Create the .MSG file as we all know it.

2) Since the destination is outside our own zone:

2a) Put the ifna kludge algorithmic address into the .MSG fileç
header: ``myzone/destzone''. This case, the message is markedç
``1/2'', ie. implied full address is ``1:1/2'', if the IFNAç
Kludge ``zone gate''.

2b) Put the ``full'' address into the INTL line:
    ``Control-A)INTL 2:500/1 1:125/111''. 
}

Programs that don't understand the INTL line just route accordingç
to ancient tradition to 1/2, with no side effects. Programs thatç
understand INTL lines do whatever it is they decide to do.
 
The only thing that Fido does that is different here is that itç
hides the ugliness. Fido has a pure three level addressingç
scheme, and knows enough to how to treat what I call ``fullyç
addressed'' (INTL lines) messages properly.
 
By default, Fido treats the network as a true three levelç
addressing scheme; a message addressed to ``2:500/1'' will go toç
mathematically correct ``2:0/0'', the host for that zone. (Zoneç
Host not Zone Gate.) I realize this isn't what is desired, IFNAç
kludge or not, and am not trying to foist anything on anyone. Theç
intent was a ``pure'' FidoNet three level mailer, and that's whatç
I got.
 
The problem is solved by the router. There is a route file,ç
supplied with the FIDO.EXE program, called ROUTE.DEF. It only hasç
to exist, and it is applied to *all* possible FidoNet routingç
unless overridden. By default, Fido will do the Zone Hostç
routing; all you do is specify a new host:
 
{\tty
Zone 2; ZoneGate 1:1/2
\dots
Zone N; ZoneGate 1:1/N
\dots
}

A ROUTE.DEF file is supplied with Fido. Instead of all mail forç
zone 2 going to ``2:0/0'', the ``pure'' ZoneHost, it goes to (inç
this example) ``1:1/2''. It could all go to ``1:125/31'' andç
drive Bob Kovach crazy. It could even go to ``3:1/1'' and wasteç
everybodys time. For a Fido operated in Europe, in Zone 2, itç
would have a ROUTE.DEF that contained:
 
\lline{\tt Zone 1; ZoneGate 2:2/1}

My intent was to build a mailer devoid of all kludges, plus solveç
the stupid IFNA Kludge thing. Plus not force someone to use ``myç
way''.

Zones are here to stay, and I do not like coding things twice.ç
Network addressing issues are very serious, and we have to liveç
with them for years, and I want to do things ``right''. This isç
my solution; if anyone is interested in implementation detailsç
just ask!
