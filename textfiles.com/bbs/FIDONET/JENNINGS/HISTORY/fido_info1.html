			Very few would argue that information bears no relevance to the concept of a



			democratic society.  Most of these societies have entrenched this



			principle into the constitutions and charters that guide them.   Yet although



			the right to expression and exchange of ideas is guaranteed, the means by



			which this information can be disseminated have been heavily protected and



			regulated.  Since the 60s however, technological booms have increased the



			efficiency and potential accessibility of the information flow.   The use of



			computers for data transmission has revolutionized the concept of information



			dissemination in such a way that these times have been dubbed the



			&quot;Information Age.&quot;  The irony of this title lies in the reality that



			few are permitted to



			benefit and greater lengths are taken to limit access to the information



			source.



			<p>



			However, along with this technological boom came the accessibility of the means



			to achieve the end.  The boom provided many individuals with a



			powerful technology  heretofore inaccessible to the  layperson. With this



			technology a creative few discovered the means to turn a home computer from a



			typewriter into a printing press.  The technology provided them with the key to



			the rapid and efficient dissemination of information and eventually to the



			source of the existing information resources.



			<p>



			As the largest amateur information network in the world, FidoNet was born out



			of accessible technology, creativity and a strong desire of



			individuals to be a part of the &quot;Information Age&quot;.  Since the early



			1980s FidoNet has been instrumental in the dissemination of ideas and in making



			accessible the technology necessary to this end.  In less than a decade it has



			grown to span &quot;over 30 countries in North and South America, all parts of



			the



			pacific rim including the Orient, Australia and New Zealand, Western and parts



			of eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa&quot; (fido.txt)  with over 10,000



			nodes  (addresses) worldwide.



			<p>



			However, despite its celeritous development and evolution, and all best



			intentions, the future of FidoNet as a major force in the dissemination and



			accessibility of information continues to be threatened by its inability to



			reconcile its function as a force for the development of data transfer



			technology and its role as a gateway to the information resource.   The



			resolution of the conflict between its technological and communicative



			functions, which originated from its inception and continues to be prevalent



			throughout the network structure, will determine its direction and allow it to



			continue to thrive.



			<p>



			Before any discussion on the nature and origins of FidoNet is allowed to



			continue, certain issues items must be clarified.  FidoNet is an amateur



			network: it was constructed at a grassroots level, and is not controlled or



			regulated (or funded) by any outside body.  Use of FidoNet for commercial



			activity is strictly forbidden.   The network itself is best described as a



			series of privately owned and independently operated terminals using a common



			information transfer protocol and compatible utilities to transfer information



			over private telephone lines.   &quot;FidoNet is not a common carrier or a



			value-added service network and is a public network only in as much as the



			independent, constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the



			network on their system.&quot; (policy 4.07, June 1989)



			<p>



			FidoNet is an abstract entity: it's structure is defined by purpose and is ever



			changing to accommodate the needs of those who utilize it.  There is



			no common history of FidoNet beyond the initial creation of the technology. The



			rapid dissemination of information permitted by the FidoNet utility



			allowed for the standard to be adopted in various parts of the world virtually



			simultaneously.  For this reason, the growth of FidoNet cannot be observed



			beyond the evolution of the utility and the adaptations of the mail transfer



			structure to accommodate the  network's expansion.



			<p>



			There is no Official FidoNet history.  Nowhere does there exist a formal,



			objective documentation on the creation and evolution of the network,



			instead the history of FidoNet must be pieced together from the personal



			accounts and observations of various participants about their FidoNet



			experience in their local network.  For this reason, FidoNet history is fraught



			with contradiction and severely limited    scope.   This study is



			bounded by the limitations of the available data.   In certain instances



			special attention may be drawn to FidoNet activity in Eastern Ontario to



			compensate for the diversity and ambiguity of the network as a whole.  Eastern



			Ontario represents the highest, and some of the earliest, FidoNet activity in



			the country and is therefore a suitable microcosm of FidoNet in Canada.



			<p>



			FidoNet began as a direct mail exchange program created  and tested by Tom



			Jennings in San Francisco  and John Madill in Baltimore in 1983. &quot;They



			designed a system where, as a nightly event, [each BBS]  would shut down and



			run utilities that automatically transferred the changed files between



			author's BBSs&quot; (Harry Newton, 1991).   The utility, according to Tom



			Jennings was created initially  &quot;to see if it could be done&quot;



			(Jennings feb85, FidoNet



			History) but it's usefulness for the exchange of information quickly became



			apparent.   As messages were more quickly transmitted through phone lines as



			condensed &quot;packets,&quot; more information could be sent the distance



			without spending as much time on long distance lines. The power of this rapid,



			inexpensive transfer of information and files was immediately demonstrated in



			the exponential expansion and development of the original technology.



			Facilitated data transfer allowed more developers to work on the technology



			simultaneously and to efficiently exchange necessary data.



			<p>



			Within a very short period of time, Jennings and Madill were communicating with



			a much greater number of systems (over 30 in 1984 by



			Jennings' account but this number appears to refer only to the core FidoNet



			group and not ALL systems utilizing  the FidoNet utility).  At this time the



			format of information  exchanged was limited to either data files (as in



			programming source code etc.) or as E-mail type messages called Netmail.



			<p>



			As the number of Fido systems grew, the simple method of direct packet exchange



			between point A and point B was no longer practicable. A method of



			moving information to various points became necessary. This was the beginning



			of the routing system (the backbone):  information destined for one system



			could be sent to another and passed on until it reached it's destination.  The



			increase in FidoNet participants also necessitated a method of identification



			to ensure that routed information (hereafter referred to as mail) reached it's



			destination.  Each FidoNet system was then given an address (called a node)



			that was included on a Nodelist that was distributed to each FidoNet system and



			updated as new systems joined the network.   To this date the Nodelist is



			the most concrete representation of the network and is the single most



			important component in its operation.



			<p>



			As the number of systems increased adjustments needed to be made: &quot;the



			Fido software was changing [...] rapidly, to accommodate all the changes



			(literally a version a day for a few weeks).&quot; (Jennings 1985, Fido



			History) One of the significant changes was the creation of Echomail in 1985. 



			The



			concept was born from a group of Dallas Fido system operators desire to



			communicate more effectively.  Their needs were discussed collectively and a



			working utility was produced by Jeff Rush.  ( Opus Sysop Operations Manual,



			p155)  Echomail combined the  notion of Netmail  with the established routing



			technology.   Discussion conferences were created on a variety of topics where



			participants messages would be distributed along the backbone to any system



			that had signed up for the conference.  The movement and distribution of



			Echomail quickly became a fundamental and critical part of FidoNet.



			<p>



			Meanwhile, even as Tom Jennings and  John Madill  distributed the FidoNet



			utility to their colleagues throughout the United States, it was



			spreading to various other parts of the U.S., Canada and Western Europe



			simultaneously creating  a series of small localized networks which



			contributed to further spread of the technology.



			<p>



			As early as 1983, FidoNet had expanded into Canada.  &quot;Andy Lusher [...]



			Was the first [system operator] in this area to connect to the FidoNet system



			as a [system operator].  Shortly after, [...] Al Hacker started running a



			FidoNet BBS in Ottawa and applied for a network number which was granted.&quot;



			(Charles Herriot, History of Net163)  Within 2 years the number of FidoNet



			nodes within the Ottawa area had grown to 10 nodes, another 7 joined the



			following year.   The local network was not part of the established backbone at



			that time and the receipt of echomail necessitated the local system



			operators to take turns making the long distance call to FidoNet BBSes in the



			United States . (Charles Herriot, A History of Net 163)   The FidoNet backbone



			was extended as the number of FidoNet systems eventually increased.



			<p>



			Growth within FidoNet has been phenomenal.  In under 10 years the technology



			has spanned almost every continent with an estimated 13,000 nodes



			worldwide  (actual numbers are unavailable as systems continuously drop out or



			join at any given time).  However this number does not include all Fido



			compatible systems as there are an innumerable number of BBSes and private



			systems that receive FidoNet mail from a Fido node but do not have their own



			Fidonode address.  In addition there a a growing number (over 80) of Othernets



			(alternate amateur networks using FidoNet protocol, utilities and mail



			transfer procedures) which all support an indeterminate number of nodes and



			many of which receive and contribute to FidoNet echomail traffic.



			<p>



			FidoNet in the National Capital Area has grown to over 152 nodes hosted by



			three local networks (two in Ottawa, one in Petawawa) since 1983.  That



			represents an average growth of approximately 17 nodes per year in the Ottawa



			area alone (close to 1500 nodes per year worldwide).



			<p>



			In order to accommodate the demands of information dissemination between the



			growing number of nodes, a more effective mail delivery system



			needed to be established.   Using the currently evolving system, a FidoNet mail



			delivery structure was created and continues as the *base* of FidoNet



			structure today.  The principle lay basically in dividing the network into



			manageable parts which meant dividing the nodes on the nodelist geographically



			and breaking the network down into smaller groups.



			<p>



			Today the nodes are broken down primarily by Zones, which are generally



			delineated by continental boundaries (ie Zone 1 - North America,  Zone 2



			-Europe, Zone 3 -Oceania, Zone 4 -Latin America, Zone 5 -Africa, and Zone 6



			-Asia).  These Zones are further broken down into smaller Regions that



			generally encompass an area containing 2-3 states or provinces in Zone 1 or one



			or two countries in Zone 2.  Within these Regions are any number of Local



			Networks or independent nodes called Regional Independents (where no local



			network exists).   Nodes may be divided into smaller Hubs within large



			networks.  An administrative structure has been put in place at each level of



			the structure to oversee the proper flow of mail and the management and update



			of the Nodelist.



			<p>



			The operation of this structure can be demonstrated through the flow of mail



			from its entry point ( for example, a local node) to its destination (say



			a European node, in Zone 2).  The sender would enter the message at the local



			node.   The node compresses the message along with other outbound mail and



			send it along to its local Hub.  The Hub sends the mail received from all of



			its nodes on to the Network Coordinator  (NC) who, in turn, sends the mail



			received from all of  the Local Network Hubs on to the Regional Coordinator



			(RC) .  The Regional Coordinator passes the Local Networks' and Regional



			Independents' mail on to the Zone Coordinator (ZC) for that Zone.  The Zone



			Coordinator would then send the mail over to the destination Zone to be



			distributed through the structure to the destination node.  Of course , in



			echomail, the message would be distributed to all systems along the structure



			that carried the discussion group into which the message was entered.  In the



			case of international distribution echomail (as in this  example), the Zone



			Coordinator of the entry point Zone would distribute the mail to all other



			Zones, including the destination Zone, for distribution to nodes who carry the



			conference.



			<p>



			This structure was developed to minimize long distance charges in the



			dissemination of mail and to ensure that the information is distributed to



			FidoNet in its entirety.   Remaining long distance charges, incurred from



			connect time between each level of the *C ( *C refers to any or all level of



			Coordinator) structure, is recovered from the individual nodes and passed along



			the structure in such a way that each level is subsidized by the one



			beneath it.  The method of cost recovery is at the discretion of each local



			network.   In NET163 (the largest of the three Local Networks), echomail



			contributions are voluntary, no fee structure exists but nodes receiving a



			great deal of echomail are encouraged to contribute accordingly.  The Ottawa



			area nodes differ as well in that the Regional Coordinator for Eastern Canada



			is a member of the Ottawa Network and no long distance charges are incurred in



			the mail transfer between these points.  However, the Ottawa networks continue



			to subsidize the Regional Coordinator to offset the costs of other long



			distance networks within the region.



			<p>



			In an attempt to enforce and protect this mail delivery system, a basic FidoNet



			policy document was put in place.   It was recognized that &quot;FidoNet is



			large enough that it would quickly fall apart of its own weight unless some



			sort of structure and control were imposed on it.  Multinet operation provides



			the structure.  Decentralized management provides the control.  This document



			describes the procedures which have been developed to manage the network.&quot;



			(policy 4.07, June 1989)



			<p>



			The scope of FidoNet policy is limited to the definition of each level of the



			structure and its purpose in the movement of mail.  For example, the



			administrative responsibilities of the Network Coordinator are outlined as



			follows:



			<p>



			&quot;1) To receive incoming mail for nodes in the network, and arrange



			delivery to its recipients.



			<br>



			<br>



			2)  To assign node numbers to nodes in the network.



			<br>



			<br>



			3)  To maintain the nodelist for the network, and to send a copy of it to the



			Regional Coordinator whenever it changes.



			<br>



			<br>



			4)  To make available to nodes in the network new nodelist difference files,



			new issues of Fidonews, and new



			revisions of Network Policy Documents as they are received, and to periodically



			check to ensure that nodes



			use up to date nodelists.&quot; (policy 4.07 June 1989)



			<p>



			Regulations guiding FidoNet are limited to the obligation of sustaining



			compatibility with FidoNet standards and of making the node available



			exclusively for mail transfer for one hour per day (the Zone Mail Hour, also



			know as ZMH).  Every other aspect of the control and regulation of FidoNet is



			regulated by two very general commandments: &quot;Thou shalt not excessively



			annoy others&quot; and &quot;Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.&quot;



			(policy 4.07 June 1989)



			The definition of these terms is left at the discretion of the *C structure.



			The document also outlines a voting mechanism for the appointment of higher *C



			(Zone Coordinator) positions and for the approval of policy documents. Network



			Coordinators and Regional Coordinators are appointed by their superior



			level (However, elections are held in Region 12 for RC and within Net163 for



			NC).



			<p>



			There is no specific policy concerning echomail cost compensation nor are there



			any specifications as the to the operations of FidoNet nodes or the



			information content of individual systems (moderators of discussion groups may



			impose some regulations to this end).  The limited scope of FidoNet policy is



			intended to account for the diversity of needs of FidoNet nodes and to allow



			for their accommodation by the Local Networks themselves.  FidoNet recognizes



			the right of system operators to manage their individual systems in any manor



			chosen (within the law).  A strict technical interpretation of the network



			also prevents the imposition of culturally biased values on international nodes.



			<p>



			However, since FidoNet Policy has not been updated since 1989 and the network



			is in a constant state of evolution and growth, many aspects of



			FidoNet have gone unregulated.   Although Policy Document 4.07 allows for the



			appointment of an &quot;assistant&quot; to help the Coordinator with the mail



			processing



			burden, it in no way provides for the current evolution of FidoNet.  As the



			number of nodes continued to increase, it became common practice for



			Coordinators to appoint assistants to process mail while the Coordinators saw



			to the general administration of the network. This became such common practice



			(some would say a necessity) that an entire sub-structure of Echomail



			Coordinators (*EC) was created to move the mail while the *C structure tended



			to the administration.   Ambiguity in the existing policy document, and their



			removal from the general administration of the network, led to an eventual



			attempt at  autonomy by the *EC structure from the established Coordinator



			structure.



			<p>



			The network today finds itself in a struggle between conflicting views on the



			direction and mandate of  FidoNet.  Factions within the network have



			begun to align themselves along two broad points of view.  These affiliation



			can in effect be characterized by the very existence of the two structures.



			One side of the debate recognizes FidoNet as a powerful medium of



			communication; a means for the free flow of ideas and the exchange of



			knowledge.  The other side identifies FidoNet as a means for the development of



			fast and efficient data transfer technology.   One structure ensures the



			growth and development of the network, the other tends toward the increasing



			efficiency and speed of the movement of mail.



			<p>



			As would be expected, ensuing discussion about the direction and purpose of the



			network has lead to growing disaccord and politicization throughout



			FidoNet.  In the case of some Local Networks, as in Ottawa's Net163, these



			factors have led to an all-out war.



			<p>



			Net163 was created at the &quot;very beginning&quot; of FidoNet and has evolved



			and progressed along with it.  Alignments were formed within a very short period



			of time, as disagreements mounted over the direction and purpose of the



			network.   Two factions became quite apparent (as described by Charles Herriot



			[making no attempt to disguise his alignment]):



			<p>



			&quot;SOCIALOIDS: generally the Visiting team in a [disagreement] of any kind. 



			These people labour under the



			delusion that FidoNet is a hobby meant to be enjoyed [...]



			<p>



			TECHNOIDS: the home team when Netwars are played. The technoids believe that



			technical performance



			outweighs whether anyone actually enters messages or not [...]&quot; (Charles



			Herriot, The Net 163 Coles Notes, July



			1991.)



			<p>



			Typical items of contention were the content of messages and



			&quot;appropriate&quot; topics of discussion, the use of pseudonyms, and



			interpretation



			and equal application of policy.  There was general disapproval of the



			&quot;Socialoids'&quot; lack of interest in the technology and with the



			&quot;Technoids'&quot;



			inflexibility.



			<p>



			The one group encourages the use of FidoNet for communication and attempts to



			inspire the less technically adept to set up the FidoNet



			compatible systems to become nodes.  A local help manual was produced in order



			to explain in a clear simple way the &quot;basics&quot;  and functioning of



			FidoNet to



			new system operators.  A Welcome Wagon node was also established to provide new



			members with information or names of those FidoNet operators who are



			available and willing to help with the technology. &quot;Socialoids&quot;



			advocate the bending of rules and liberal interpretation of policy, in some



			instances, for



			the less adept.



			<p>



			The other side advocates the strict adherence to structure and technical



			specifications.  The &quot;Technoids&quot; discourage admission of non-



			technically



			oriented people into FidoNet because of the potential for error and disruption



			of the mail transfer system.  New system operators seeking help are often met



			with hostility.  This attitude is apparent in the testimonial of a new Net163



			sysop who had managed to set up a running, FidoNet compatible system despite



			his admission of knowing only &quot;about three DOS commands, and how to type



			'telix' [...]



			<p>



			So far I've noticed how the whole organization is set up a bit like a wrestling



			match.  So far in my Net career, I've been threatened of being



			tossed from it by several people, none of whom have the power to do so.  My



			introduction to the Net was anything but friendly [...]&quot; (Nick Panther,



			How I



			Got Into the Net, Jan 1990)



			<p>



			There exists the real concern that a lack of technical ability or constant



			&quot;bending of the rules&quot; to accommodate those systems who are unable to



			get fully compliant, would eventually lead to the collapse of the mail transfer



			structure.  It is also feared that the lack of interest in the



			technology could also impede the progress and technological development that



			have played such a large part in the creation of FidoNet.  However, strict



			inflexibility of technical policy would prevent many from joining FidoNet and



			would greatly restrict the access to the information resource.  Technological



			elitism is also a very real problem with a purely technical orientation.  As



			new technological developments arise and are put into place, access to the



			network and information source becomes further restricted to those who have



			access to the higher technology.



			<p>



			There is no clear cut solution to repairing the rifts that have grown within



			FidoNet.  The disaccord between the two points of view in the Ottawa



			network escalated to such a degree as to cause a split of Net163. A physical



			division was created between &quot;Technoids&quot; and &quot;Socialoids&quot;



			as those with a



			technical bent migrated to the newly formed Net 243 (also in Ottawa).   Such a



			division on a larger scale would mark the eminent collapse of FidoNet.



			Ongoing power struggles between the *C and *EC structures have already weakened



			its foundation and various attempts at reconciliation through policy



			revisions have failed to gain acceptance.



			<p>



			The growth and prosperity of an independent information network such as FidoNet



			is nothing short of phenomenal.  That it has succeeded thus far,



			despite the innumerable technological changes and exponential growth since its



			inception, is a testimonial to the ability of individuals to come together to



			fulfill a common goal.  Members of FidoNet today need to recognize the



			interdependence of both the communicative and technical functions of FidoNet;



			they need to rediscover the sense of cooperation upon which the network was



			originally built or it will eventually, yet inevitably, pull itself apart.
