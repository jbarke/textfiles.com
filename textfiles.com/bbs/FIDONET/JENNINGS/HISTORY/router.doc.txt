FIDO/FIDONET ROUTING, TOPOLOGY, HISTORY AND RECENT CHANGES
Tom Jennings, 1:125/111

Fido/FidoNet, like all other FidoNet mailers and BBSs, generatesç
messages, and puts them into packets that are later delivered toç
some appropriate destination by the mailer itself. All of theç
different mailers use different approaches as to just how you theç
sysop control where, how and when packets (and the messages theyç
contain) get delivered.

In light of all the mailer systems out there today, I don't thinkç
many are aware of just how Fido/FidoNet does it's routing. With aç
few recent changes (more to follow) you might find the design hasç
become interesting.


FIDO

Fido was originally just a bulletin board; the first FidoNet wasç
a separate program that was run from a batch file with a fewç
small hooks into the BBS. (The origin of the Fido version 9 - 11ç
MAIL.SYS file.) Fido (the BBS) only let users generate messages;ç
FidoNet (the mailer) put messages into packets and deliveredç
them.

At this point, five years later, Fido and FidoNet are pretty wellç
integrated, and this latest revision completes the weld.ç
Logically, to the user and sysop, the two remain quite separate,ç
and many (non-FidoNet) Fido systems are BBS only. (Most of myç
commercial customers are BBS only.) It is just as easy to runç
FidoNet without Fido.

Fido's packeting/mailing system works in four discrete phases.ç
First, the destination node addresses for all the existingç
messages is determined. This is done by the "router", more onç
which follows. Second, the messages are put into packets by theç
"packeter" (I never was very good at names). Third, the phaseç
that is most obvious to sysops watching the screen, is when theç
packets are delivered; Fido makes outgoing phone calls and sendsç
the packets. Packets can also be received inbetween outgoingç
calls. The last phase deletes un-sent packets, and marks theç
original messages that went into the packets as "(SENT)" asç
appropriate. This ends the FidoNet session.

Note that unlike Opus and other similar mailers, Fido only puts aç
copy of the message into a packet; during the fourth phase Fidoç
again processes each message, and marks it or deletes it asç
determined by the success of that packet delivery.

This is a fairly large amount of processing to do when looked atç
on a per-message basis, and is why Fido's FidoNet has always beenç
slower to packet than other systems. In return there are manyç
advantages, that will become more obvious later.


FIDO AND FIDONET

Originally, as was stated before, Fido and FidoNet were twoç
separate programs. Even when integrated into one package,ç
starting with Fido version 9 or 10, FidoNet was only usable whenç
a FidoNet scheduled event was actually running; "continuous mail"ç
is (relative to Fido) a new concept. Version 12 (Aug. 1987) couldç
accept incoming continuous mail, but not send mail unless aç
FidoNet event was running. Version 12M supports Wazoo and fileç
requests.

Starting with version 12N, the FidoNet portion of Fido can beç
accessed at any time; packet creation and routing is underç
complete control, and can be altered, automatically using theç
routing language on a event by event basis throughout the day, orç
manually as the sysop sees fit, up to the point when the specificç
message has been delivered. Events themselves can be turned onç
and off from within Fido, allowing very high-level control overç
packet routing.

You can have Fido create packets available for pickup, with anyç
arbitrary routing, at any time of day. For example, you can haveç
HOLD packets of long-distance systems waiting for pickup fromç
9:00AM til 6:00PM, while enabling outgoing calls on local-dialç
systems, in between human callers, or any other construct allowedç
by the routing language, without restriction. There is aç
"penalty" of 30 - 60 seconds to prepare for a new schedule; onceç
started, access is in the under 100 mS range. 

On my 8MHz "turbo" junk-pclone, 80mS 20 meg drive, Fido takes 20ç
seconds to load, create outgoing packets and be ready for anç
incoming call (human or otherwise). On this crappy hardware,ç
incoming echomail is received, unpacketed, tossed, the echo areasç
then scanned and outgoing packets made and delivered in 60 - 90ç
seconds, in between human callers, using DCM and barefootç
Fido/FidoNet 12N.

The largest network Fido/FidoNet can (mathematically!) handle isç
(32767 * 32767 * 32767) or 3.5 x 10(13) nodes; version 12'sç
implementation 65,000. A recompile (change a table index from 16ç
to 32 bits) will make Fido handle about 4 billion nodes with someç
performance loss and increased (disk) overhead, about 2ç
bytes/node. Performance with 65,000 nodes would still be betterç
than Fido 12M's.

Current nodelist overhead (NODELIST.132) is: NODELIST.BBS 304,532ç
(physical data); NODELIST.NMP 53,920 (nodemap; see below);ç
NODELIST.IDX 53920 (main index); NODELIST.NDX 2900 (host index).ç
NODELIST.SYS is no longer used.


FIDONET TOPOLOGY

The router design mimics exactly the FidoNet network topology.ç
The network went through three (so far...) stages: a "flat"ç
system, ie. point to point; addresses were a simple number 1 -ç
32767. The second formalized the concept of "nets", incorporatingç
the routing optimization formerly done with Fido's primitiveç
router. Third, the current scheme, includes zones, which areç
similar mathematically to nets, but in real life act quiteç
differently, with "zone gates" concentrating mail between zonesç
(generally continents) because of real-life issues of telephoneç
connect costs and equipment compatibility.


OOPS BACKTRACK A LITTLE:

A small aside on nets and regions: "regions" originally were onlyç
a way for nodes not in a net (ie. not inside a local callingç
area) to be syntactically compatible with the "net/node"ç
addressing scheme; since most nodes were in the most heavilyç
populated areas, cities, where nets naturally form, "regions"ç
would be where nodes not in cities would be found. Nodes inç
regions (marked REGION in the nodelist) act as any other node,ç
but the mailers do not do the automatic routing to the "host" forç
the region -- mail is sent direct, or point to point.ç
Additionally, the function of region hosts as another layer ofç
organizational heirarchy is a recent addition, and not part ofç
the topology itself. Still further, there is nothing magic aboutç
the numbers themselves -- regions being numbered 1 - 99, nets 100ç
- 999 etc is a totally arbitrary decision on the part of theç
keepers-of-the-lists. The only magic numbers are 0's -- theseç
indicate the host for the entity, ie. zone, net or region.


ROUTER DESIGN

Back to the router design. While the heirarchical model ofç
net/node is extremely useful (if not indispensible) there areç
still thousands of exceptions, usually on a system by systemç
basis; you forward mail for one system that is local but is aç
toll call for other net members. Your net has a sugar daddy thatç
can make long distance outgoing calls. One system calls in toç
pickup their mail. Commonly called systems are more efficientlyç
handled in some special way.

Fido's router design can handle any topology based on our addressç
syntax: zone:net/node, plus any arbitrary number of exceptions.ç
To do this, the router is very simple -- not complex. 

Logically, the router is an N x N crossbar switch, where N is theç
number of nodes in the nodelist. You can imagine a crossbarç
switch by drawing on paper a grid:

IN
  --> 1 ----O---O---O---O---O
	    |   |   |   |   |
      2	----O---O---O---O---O
	    |   |   |   |   |
      3	----O---X---O---O---O
	    |   |   |   |   |
      4	----O---O---O---O---O
	    |   |   |   |   |
      5	----O---O---O---O---O
	    |   |   |   |   |
            1   2   3   4   5
		   OUT

Shown is a 5 x 5 crossbar switch. The O's represent an OFF (butç
potential) connection; X's represent a ON connection. Theç
connection (3,2) is ON, all others closed. If a signal wereç
applied to Input 3, it would appear also on Output 2. (ASCIIç
graphics are terrible, sorry!) You will notice that by placingç
X's and O's appropriately, any input can be connected to anyç
output.

A "real" crossbar switch can route one signal to manyç
destinations; just place X's along the same horizontal row in theç
example above. Any node can route to any node; times (N) nodes isç
(N * N) possible states. Not pleasant to think about in realç
terms -- a 5000 node nodelist would mean 25,000,000 states toç
represent on your disk! This is not a very useful side effect forç
us; our messages have a single destination address.

Fido's router places one limitation upon the crossbar design:ç
there can be only one possible destination per node. It can stillç
be any possible node, but only one at a time. This means theç
router can consist of (2 * N) entries -- the originating node andç
the destination node.

You can imagine Fido's router as the crossbar switch above, or asç
I do, a simple two column table:

	----+----
	1   |	_
	2   |	_
	3   |	2
	4   |	_
	5   |	_

The _'s represent potential, but OFF connections. #3 has beenç
routed to #2 by merely filling in that table entry. This table isç
called the NodeMap.

(Fido's nodemap also contains a third column, where attributesç
like HOLD, SEND-TO, PICKUP and other things are stored. Theseç
atributes are built into the nodemap for programming convenienceç
only, they are not really part of the router per se.)


HOW THE ROUTER WORKS

At FidoNet mail time, Fido prepares the router files beforeç
making packets and outgoing phone calls. The basic net hostç
routing is performed, then any routing specified by the sysop inç
route language files. 

Before any routing, the table looks like this:

	ADDRESS		ROUTE-TO	ATTRIBUTES
	1:1/1		1:1/1		  (none)
	1:1/2		1:1/2		  ...
	...		...		  ...
	1:125/0		1:125/0
	1:125/20	1:125/20
	1:125/111	1:125/111
	...		...
	2:500/0		2:500/0
	2:500/2		2:500/2
	...		...		  ...

Basic default routing is applied, which does the FidoNet-as-we-
know-it net and zonegate routing (see the Appendix A: DEFAULTç
ROUTING section):

	ADDRESS		ROUTE-TO	ATTRIBUTES
	1:1/1		1:1/1		  ...
	1:1/2		1:1/2
	...		...
	1:125/0		1:125/0
	1:125/20	1:125/0
	1:125/111	1:125/0
	...		...
	2:500/0		1:1/2
	2:500/2		1:1/2
	...		...

At this point Fido performs any additional routing you may haveç
specified, such as overriding the routing, HOLD packets, enablingç
only certain nodes or groups of nodes per schedule, etc. Thingsç
like HOLD, PICKUP, SEND-TO and other basic concepts are asç
attributes within the nodemap.

The nodemap is built on disk, and can be saved between schedulesç
so that it an be used over and over; this is called a "QUICK"ç
FidoNet event. It takes my Fido system mentioned aboveç
approximately 90 seconds to completely build the nodemap (aboutç
100 route language statements); subsequent "QUICK" events take aç
fraction of a second.


PACKET CREATION

Fido creates packets when a FidoNet schedule starts (which isç
controlled by Fido's scheduler and is outside this discussion).ç
For every message in the netmail message area, Fido consults theç
nodemap, in two steps:

First, the actual destination (for example: 1:125/111) is lookedç
up in the ADDRESS column of the nodemap. The ROUTE-TO columnç
determines where this message goes, ie. into which packet. If theç
destination node is not found, the message is marked (ORPHAN).

Secondly, Fido looks up the packet (ROUTE-TO) address (1:125/0)ç
itself, in the ADDRESS column. This is done to locate theç
ATTRIBUTE bits for the destination node. If the bits indicate itç
is OK to packet this message (SEND-TO set, etc) then the packeterç
creates the packet.

This is done for all messages in the netmail area; once all theç
packets are built then FidoNet can dial out, allow incomingç
pickups, etc.

Messages put into packets are not modified in any way; packetsç
contain a copy of the original message. The post-FidoNet processç
takes care of messages that have been sent.


FIDONET SESSION COMPLETION

When a FidoNet schedule is over, Fido processes packets that wereç
received from other mailers and cleans up any packets it hadç
created earlier. 

Packets that are un-sent are merely killed; the messages thatç
these packet(s) were created from still exist in the netmailç
area; when a FidoNet session start again, Fido may put theç
messages into a packet to the same destination node or possiblyç
another; since packeting is done only before actual mailing theç
routing can be altered at any point up to actual sucessfulç
transmission.

Packets that are sent, or picked up, are handled slightlyç
differently. The packets themselves are deleted, but Fido onceç
again refers to the router to mark the messages that comprisedç
the packet as (SENT), or kills them if they were indicatedç
(KILL/SENT) by the originator.





Appendix A: DEFAULT ROUTING

Fido/FidoNet's routing is not "built-in" nor hard-coded; if itç
were not told otherwise, Fido would send messages to theç
destinations in the message itself. The routing needed to make aç
practical mailer are added as layers upon this base; the tradeoffç
is speed vs. flexibility and accuracy. (Speed is, um, somewhatç
improved over older implementations...)

What the real-life Fido does at FidoNet mail time is make a passç
through the table, and fill in the "default" routing that definesç
the FidoNet tolopogy, which is our zone:net/node with routing toç
HOSTs for nets, which goes like this:

       -For nodes in our own net, send direct (point to 
        point)

       -For nodes in a net in our zone, outside our net, 
        send to it's host (net/0)

       -For nodes in a region in our zone, sent direct

       -For nodes in another zone, send to it's zone 
        host (zone:0/0)

The first three make sense in the network as we know it; theç
fourth requires some background.

FidoNet's topology is based upon a gimmick: the address of theç
logical host for any net or zone is composed ot the number of theç
net or zone, with the magic zero added as the least signifigantç
address field. A net or region host is net/0 or region/0; a zoneç
host is zone:0/0. FidoNet sysops use net/0 routinely; no one usesç
zone:0/0 routinely, if at all.

The difference is that the addressing scheme, the topology, is aç
mathematical construct, and has nothing to do with the realç
world, ie. overseas phone calls, governmental regulations,ç
manufacturer incompatibilies, etc. The addressing scheme needs toç
be rigorous and provide a solid design base for allç
implementations. 

If we didn't have real-life complications like the above, neverç
mind how overloaded the poor zone host computer would be, theç
mathematical model might fit the real world. Obviously itç
doesn't, and never did.

The solution in Fido's scheme is to merely modify the defaultç
routing. There exists a keyword in Fido's routing languageç
(called, not surprisingly, "ZoneGate") that does exactly what itç
sounds like: it routes all mail destined for another zone to anyç
arbitrary node designated "zone gate". 

Zone Gates were thunk up at the now notorious "New Hampshireç
meeting" in '86 or so. The idea was to make it so that net/nodeç
mailers, ie. not zone-aware, could route messages destined forç
other zones. The thing was called the "IFNA Kludge", and consistsç
of two parts: (1) an addressing kludge to trick the mailer toç
route the interzone message to a node in it's own zone, and (2)ç
to have the full zone:net/node origination and destinationç
addresses buried in the message body itself, hidden behind a lineç
that began with Control-A, so that message editors could learn toç
ignore it. (For your curiosity: full address consists of the veryç
first line in the message, that looks like: "^AINTL z:n/f z:n/f",ç
where the first address is the destination node address, theç
second the originator.)

The addressing trick is: "Address the message for zone (N) toç
node 1/(N) in my zone". Node 1/(N) is designated the zone gate;ç
for example, the zonegate for Europe, Zone 2, node 1/2, in theç
North American zone 1. And so on.
