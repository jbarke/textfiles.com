Hi Tom,
       here's a nice little excersize to think about.  It's not 
hyperthetical
so a real answer would be appreciated but don't spend any money on lawyers.

          We have a couple of guys in Finland who have started a small 
company. They have called that company, FidoNet Ky.

          The "Ky" is a kind of registration somewhere between a 
"registered
trader" and a full blown incorporated company.  The distinction is a bit 
weird
for me but anyway, ignore it for now.

          The question is, where do you stand in this?  Do you own the
"FidoNet" mark world-wide?  Not that you would (Finnish law being what it 
is),
but could you force this company to change it's name?  What happens if they
start to trade world-wide?

          Your thoughts will make a few people happy over here. Thanks for 
yourtime.


                                                   Cheers,

Huh?! What does this mean? Is it a joke, or an intentional prod or 
dare? (I will assume its merely poor wording.)

I believe most European states have reciprocity agreements with US 
govt patents and trademarks. If there stuff coems here, they will be 
in direct violation of U.S. trademark law.
 
I would ask them please, do not name their company "FidoNet". Period. 
Even if they find it strictly legal. It *is* misleading. (I use one of 
the two best computer software trademark lawyers in the U.S.; I will 
ask about it.)

And since you asked, if they persist, they will be on my shit list.


I hope *they* are using lawyers. I do. I take the trademark stuff VERY 
seriously. It is the direct interest of the FidoNet members, all of 
them, including them, and you, to keep the trademark unsullied. (ANd 
it makes me *no money*, zero.) The trademark will be defended, I can 
assure you of that. 
 
I wouls ask you please to forward this message, or its contents, 
interpreted, and let them know how important this is. It's not a joke 
at all.
 
ANd if they insist, could you provide me with contact information? 
(Actually, I'd like their address now, if you have it.)
