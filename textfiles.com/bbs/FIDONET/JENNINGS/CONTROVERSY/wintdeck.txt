So what?  Was that too much for you to cope with?  I often read several 
hundred K of messages a day.

Had you READ my message, you'd know that's not the real problem.  Compare 
the number of lines Steve has had in Fidonews _on the subject of religion_ 
against the number I've *submitted* on that subject (or Steve Winter) and 
you'll see the count is rather lopsided. 

I guess I'll just come out and say it... you are being arbitrary and 
discriminatory. I guess I'm just going to have to lower my expectations 
and not expect you to be fair.  I guess I never should have expected that, 
given your outlook on life, but I had hopes that you would try to be more 
evenhanded as editor. 

Not that it probably matters to you, but I think you should resign as 
editor.  You have seen fit to use Fidonews to promote your own personal 
biases, yet you refuse others that same option (not that that's what I'm 
doing, but that's what YOU think I'm doing, so I guess it's all the same 
if "perception is everything"). 

Just remember that the next time you're tempted to complain about 
discrimination of some form or another, you're just as guilty of it as 
anyone else. 

Is this message short enough for you to handle? 

Jack

But you cant expect everyone to match your abilities. It is just too 
much for me to read.

Maybe so, but line count is not a measure of anything useful.

I received a series of files from you and from Steve, in more or less 
random (ie. not preordained) order. I dealt with the stream as I 
could. "Discriminatory" implies a methodical handling of subjects or 
people. Not the case here -- both or you got in stuff, you are both 
welcome to submit stuff, but simply not this particular thread. ANd 
yes, any particular thing that seems to me to be closely related. This 
last may seem arbitrary, but it *is* an editors job. 

> Is this message short enough for you to handle? 

Yes, thank you it is!
 
I am sorry you are mad at me personally, but apparently it can't be 
helped. I will continue to look at everything I receive, from you 
especially, with an open mind.
