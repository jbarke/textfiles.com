 Racial and religious hatred, disease, drugs, inner-city problems, impact
 of TV, movies, music videos, and changing family values, are all determining
 the future of our existance on the planet earth!

 Planet Earth Network exists to provide a forum to discuss and formulate plans
 to deal with these important issues that we all face.  Our responsibility is
 to further the causes of peace, relations, environmental, health matters and
 other important issues of the 90's and the approaching 21st century.

 The Planet Earth Network was founded on 08/01/93; and, in the first month
 we've grown to over 100 members across the US, Canada, England, France,
 Scotland and Ireland. A flying start for this "network with a purpose."
 PEN has no "fees" and approval is FAST.  PEN hub Sysops receive and approve
 Planet Earth Network applications at the local level resulting in fast
 approvals within 24 to 48 hours!
