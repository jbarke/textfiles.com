========================================================================
well, here goes...

i spent two days fretting and worrying and feeling almost ill with
the prospect of publishing the Child_torture echo ad.  i'm bracing
misself for losts of flack.  i even logged on the the board of the
sysop who submitted the article, out of curiosity and wanting to
have my hand held {i'm such a wimp}.  I liked the sysop.

Then i read my favorite echo, which is big on easing tension with
thoughtful nonsense, to escape and be calm.  The Child_torture echo ad
cuts close to my bones, it upset me, for a while.  I had been told a
week ago that if the word "child" was substituted for the word "cat"
in the Cat_Torture ad, i would have tossed it into the bit bucket
without a second thought.  This presumptuous statement made me angry.
Anything, anything, is "fit" to publish, because censorship is
*always* worse than free speach.  I truly believe that wrongness
is caused caused by REPRESSION of ideas, not by expression of ideas.
People can not think clearly or behave freely while in mental cages.

i think the author of the Child_torture ad is brave.  He knows he's
going to be railed.  Truly, after worrying for days, i finally came
to peace with myself about this article.  I want anyone who thinks
i'm insenitive to this issue to know that i spent 10 years of my
own life alternately being anorexic and puking up my guts over "abuse"
[i'm tired of this word but lack another one].  Last night, when all
of me thoroughly decided to run the article in peace, i danced around
the living room to the Butthole Surfer's "annoying song" with a LOT
of energy, then ate a huge meal, and fell asleep and had good dreams.

Censorship, whitewashing, temerity, silence, are all bullshit.

sincerely,
sylvia

TO: (ALL) NEW READERS
FROM: Peter Toothill (Liverpool Mailbox - SysOp)
SUBJ: "MESSAGE from FIDO"

Fido Net started as the plaything of two comms enthusiasts, in 1984.

Today, it's a worldwide electronic mail system linked to more than
20,000 sites.

==========================================================
Peter Tootill charts the rise of the professional network,
still run by "amateurs" .
==========================================================

Most bulletin board users, know that there is some sort of link-up
between "Fido" bulletin boards - but many don't realise that Fido Net
(as it's called) is now a fully-fledged (international) electronic
mail system.

These days, too, Fido Net covers a lot more than just Fidos: other
bulletin board systems (BBSs) such as Opus, TBBS, and Wildcat can join
in too and there are even some stand-alone electronic mail systems
that use FidoNet(tm) "email" protocols and can link into the "fidonet"
mail system.

WORLDWIDE NETWORK

Technically, Fido Net is a non-real time packet switching message
system - in simple terms it is a sophisiticated international
electronic mail system.

However instead of using a small number of mainframe computers like
the commercial systems do, it runs on a large number of microcomputers
which are all independently operated.

There are currently about 20,000 nodes on the world list - and I mean
WORLD list.  There are participating networks in North America
(of course), most Western European countries, Australia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia, and the southern and western pacific area.

You can send a message to anyone using any of these systems simply by
entering it on your nearest participating bulletin board system.  The
cost is very reasonable as well.

FidoNews 11-27                 Page:  4                    34 Jun 1994

A message can be sent to the USA for not much more than the cost of an
airmail letter (the actual costs vary because they are set by the
sysops of the individual BBSs themselves).

FIDO was the brainchild of an American called Tom Jennings.  He and a
friend, john madill, lived on opposite sides of the United States and
wanted a straight forward way of communicating with each other.

This was in June 1984 and the first Fido Net messages were soon
bouncing across the country.  Other bulletin board operators became
interested and joined in. By August 1984 there were 30 nodes and in
the spring of 1985 nearly 200 nodes.  The network has spread widely
simce then. Today there are over 20,500 nodes of which about 20,000
are publicly accessible.  The rest are private systems, that are
members of the Net for some particular reason.

The basic comcept of Fido Net is very simple.

Each participating BBS closes down at a set time (usually 3.30am -
4.30am local time) and assembles any outgoing messages into packets.
It then automatically dials other nodes and sends the packets, waiting
between calls for incoming packets from other systems.

This process continues for about an hour, with systems alternately
dialing and listening, after which they turn back into ordinary BBSs.
The receiving system unpacks the the messages and stores themin the
bulletin boards messages area, ready for the addressee(s) to call in
and read them.

In the early days, each node simply dialed other nodes direct, and sent
the messages. This soon became un-workable because of the number of
systems trying to call each other and more complex structures were
devised as a result.

The world was divided into six ZONES.  Each Zone is divided into
Regions and these are sub-divided into nets. Nets usually consist of
a few dozen or so BBS "fido" systems within the local call area of
their Host system.

Messages are routed via these Hosts.

This has several advantages: it cuts down on congestion and makes for
more economocal operation - the only long distance calls are between
Hosts and this mail is usually compressd and sent using high speed
modems.

The whole system is designed to keep the actual online time, and hence
running costs, to an absolute minimum.

Fido Net is operated entirely by amateurs. The node list is
maintained by a group in St. Louis and there are a series of levels of
co-ordinator: one international co-ordinator, then three Zone
co-ordinators, about 60 regional co-ordinators and probably ovr 1000
net co-ordinators.

FidoNews 11-27                 Page:  5                    34 Jun 1994

The whole set-up is overseen by the International Fido Net Association
(IFNA).

Despite the amateur nature of the system, it all appears to be run in
a very professional and businesslike manner. Indeed it has to be, with
20,000 plus systems participating, there is no room, for sloppiness!

ECHOMAIL & CONFMAIL

A welcome enhancement to Fido Net is called Echomail. This adds
conferencing to Fido Net's electronic mail capabilities.  Until the
introduction of Echomail, Fido Net was just a point-to-point system,
in which a message was addressed to a node, and then sent to that node.
With Echomail, several BBSs join together to carry a conference on a
particular topic and all messages that are entered in that relevant
section of each BBS are echo-ed to all that "echo's" participating
BBSs.

Rainbows
tomj@wps.com (Tom Jennings)

> What is the rainbow crowd?

The Rainbow Family is a giant (10,000+) nomadic cultural thing in
North America. They look more or less like "hippies". You don't see
to much of them usually. They are genuinely nomadic, and hold various
Gatherings, usually a big annual one. Each year in a different US
state. About 10,000 people show up, sometimes less. They take
advantage of US Federal homesteading laws, much to the chagrin of
authorities. Gatherings are free, and everyone pitches in -- or not.
They don't worry about it. There are communal meals (pretty minimal
though, poverty is an assumption so far in the background it's
startling) made up of donated/liberated/dumpster-dived food. They
aer not necesseraily vegetarians. They have no or barter or minimal
economy. I have an ex-roommate who is a Rainbow person now. They are
definitely way far outside the usual channels. They're quite serious.
They tend to be vehicle-people, white, babies'n'dogs. They disdain
alcohol, smoke lots of pot. Usually quite trsutworthy. They are dirty.

Their methodology for gatherings is unique. They have a "welcome
committee" up where vehicles come in, who tell you where things are,
where to park, etc. They also scope people out; if they have alcohol --
generally the only thing forbidden besides firearms -- instead of a
lecture or whatever, they say "got any alcohol? Let's drink it! Here's
some of my pot!" and try to get the owner to consume it on the spot.
Usually works.

Two years back, in Nevada, the Great Circle gave Welcome Committee
FidoNews 11-27                 Page:  6                    34 Jun 1994

duty to the Faerie camp (the gay/lez bunch within the Family) because
they did an excellent job of (1) defusing a bunch of asshole bigots
with fun instead of anger and (2) "took over" a small stage devolving
into bland ordinary faux hippy folksy music and turned it into a big
open party. It was a great honor, apparently.

Too much hippy for me, though the gatherings are definitly worth
checking out. They are always the first week in July.

A Council of oldtimers (which apparently anyone can attend and provide
input, listened to or not I know not) picks the next years site, many
months in advance. A few months before, a seed group goes to the site,
and chooses a location distractingly near the real site. This draws
fire from the locals and authorities, if any trouble arises, and keeps
eyes of the actual site. They usually rent an apt or something an have
a stable mail address. Word is spread mouth to mouth and hand to hand.
No advertising of any sort is generally done, and as far as I can tell,
is frowned upon. They deal with legal issues (more and more every year
I guess) and all that.

About a month before the actual event, another seed group populates
the site and starts to prepare it. In Nevada, it took place partly on
private land; the worked out a deal with the owner that they would
leave it utterly spotless and would install a water system based upon
a water-hammer ("free" water pump power).

I can attest to the cleanliness thing. In nevada, I was there and
left early, so there were only a few thousand people. It was
*spotless*. On a mian trail, someone had dropped about a half-dozen
cellophane candy wrappers. It was a Big Deal. It was an issue at the
Great Circle, and instead of castigation and finger pointing (they the
do all this stuff internally of course, at big gatherings they tend to
be fairly cool cuz there's fresh faces and fresh energy) they went on
about how important it was they left the place clean. Seems to work.

It's a retty cool thing, iff you like hippies, eating oatmeal as your
main source of nutrition, walking 6 hours into the woods, carrying
water, being asked to eat food just cooked as you walk down a trail,
LSD, get really dirty, dig shitters, keep damnfools from shitting in
the stream, etc etc. There are some christian hippies. There are more
queer ones. I hate tie-dye, and mistrust peace and loveism. I own guns
and like computers. Oh well.

I'm wondering if it'll be ANOTHER "information highway" article
that completely ignores FidoNet while touting Internet as the
state of the art.

That really bugs me. FidoNet handles full 8 bit file transfers
while Internet won't even allow high ASCII half the time, and
they make like Internet is the next best thing to water.

Sure, it's "realtime", but it has it's delays like anything
else, and it's about as flexible as Mount Rushmore.

Fido may be slower, but most of the time it gets there with
fewer conversions (which reduces the odds of errors), and is
always one heck of a lot cheaper (that is, efficient), too.

Centralized-DEcentralization, is the key here, that makes that
work. It maintains organization, while dividing up the load of
distributing the data, through cooperation of all those who use
it.

FidoNet is "a shining example" of what the gerneral public can
do "when they all pull in the same direction". A world-wide,
batched processed, computer network, that works, and fairly
well, too.

Sure, it's not 100% reliable, but what do you expect from a
volunteer organization? And it's reliability keeps getting
better and better, with time filtering out unreliable routes,
and those who abuse it, through censorship and excommunication.

And now with the filebone growing within it, FidoNet's
versitility and utility both, by far exceed what most expect
from Internet.

FidoNews 11-27                 Page:  8                    34 Jun 1994

But above all, it's economicly feasible for EVERYONE to get!

So, it REALLY bugs me when the media touts Internet, with it's
cost in the thousands per node per year, compared to Fidonet's
less than one hundred per year, as being "the way to go", and
that "the information superhighway" is something that awaits us
in the future.

The information superhighway already exists, right here, right
NOW, in FidoNet!

Note to Editor-being prelude: Charles Herriot, of Fido
1:163/110 is honored to share more war correspondence from
Doc Logger, pharmaceutical adviser and stringer for the not
so widely read "Swamp Swine Magazine." In this latest
missive, to the Reverend & Senator Richard Visage, Logger
whines about the usual dangers of working with mid-sized
lethal animals and low flying bats. Roll da' flick, Sylvia...

June 30, 1994
Somewhere in Region12
It's Just a Step to the right

Dear Reverend Visage,

Why is it that we play poker I always seem to lose the
important bets where you drew Serbo-Croatia and I got stuck
with a venue which is truly twisted and dangerous. Not even
the largish, horse-bollus, sized tranquilizers that you
thoughtfully included seems sufficient to halt the rampaging
hordes of policymongers in this area. If we still have that
fleet of waterbombers that we used to defoliate half of
Southeast Asia with Agent Orange, we might want to convert
them to spray Valium aerosols over this region.

As you may not know, the Region12 Co-ordinator has run amok.
It seems that nets in the Southern Ontario axis have been
swapping nodes as though they were playing the sort of chess
that would have made Dean Rusk and Johnson blush through
their blood-crazed eyes. One particular net, attempted to
hold their departing nodes hostage by imposing extortionate
echomail cost recovery refund surcharges. When that failed,
they sniveled to Rick Johnston, the RC-being.

Rick was, by all accounts, a good and decent individual.
(Hell, I even let him have a dance with one of my favourite
sheep at one of our social gatherings...er or should that be
"flockings.") In a move that pushed the envelope on the wrong
side of boneheaded stupidity, Rick decreed that he would
impose specific geographic constraints upon *one* net, while
leaving other nets to poach nodes with wild abandon. (Quite
frankly, I have never enjoyed poached nodes... not even using
that recipe that you provided where they get boiled in
Glenlivet and then served on raw armadillo livers.) What made
this move a sure candidacy for some recovery time in the
Betty Ford Clinic For The Thinking Impaired, was that Rick's
own net contained nodes which clearly violated his own myopic
notions of geographic rigidity. That which he cited as
"determined by policy" wasn't applied to his own net.

When the usual polite inquiries were made... and I think
James Korolas used a word that begins with "F" and ends with
"K" and which isn't "firetruck"; ... Rick scampered into the
despotic refuge of policy scoundrelry and even invoked the
august name of Bob Satti,ZC as legitimizing reasons. (Pausing
FidoNews 11-27                 Page: 10                    34 Jun 1994

here to kneel, after mentioning Bob's name, and to proclaim:
"We're not worthy. We're not worthy.")  We may not want to
enter Rick in the olympics because there is a rumour that his
response approached the 'roid-rage variety. Rick told the
democratically elected NC of net250 that he was removed from
office and was barred from running in a subsequent election.

When Net250 informed Rick, again politely, that he should
remove himself from the presence of sharp instruments and
policy before he suffered self-inflicted wounds; Rick went
even more ballistic and arbitrarily removed Luke Kolin from
the nodelist.

As you are aware, I have always been amazed by the
metamorphosis that seems to spontaneously occur in various
*C-beings. It seemed like only yesterday that Rick Johnston
was sucking up to the region's sysops as he campaigned on a
platform of representing the wishes of sysops, as opposed to
supporting the Divine Right of Kings philosophy. We are now
blessed with his shameful retreat behind the skirts of
policy. Why is it, that when someone cites policy, that it
invariably means that the statement is a postlude to neural
malfunctioning? Why is it, when you read the words "I've
already checked this with Bob Satti" (again, pausing to
sacrifice a virgin hamster in deference to invoking Bob's
name) that you *know* that what follows will defy logic,
natural justice and good sense?

In any event, I must send this off. Your secretary has been
screaming at me for hours, and this really has nothing at all
to do with the fact the nuclear blast warnings have sounded
outside Rick's bunker. Give my regards to the nuns.

Dear Ed..I agree and I run an Adult Oriented BBS. I also strongly
object to encripted passages or signatures as also appeared in this
issue. I do have a right to refuse to forward to distribute materials
which are encripted (and I am a Net Host) as you also have the right
to refuse to accept articles with unacceptable language as part of
your FIDO news. Freedom of speech cannot be used as an argument to
condone these violations of our trust in the editor. His decision to
print these type of articles for general distribution will cause some
of us to no longer be willing to forward to them to others or carry
them on our respective boards as bulletins for our users.

Neil - NC3603

Dear Editor, Please do not forward for distribution to my net any
articles which contain any form of encription either in the text or in
the signature.  Nor any articles containing language which you would
not use in your own house of worship.

 Please pass this request to ALL of your downlinks. Thankyou.

Beyond cat torture: KID_TORTURE

Beyond cat torture: KID_TORTURE
by Steve Fredette (1:163/551)  (apologies to Michael Johnson)

    Hello FIDOnetters!  I want to announce a new echo that I am hoping
will get off the ground real quickly and make backbone status.  I am
counting on you to help me meet this goal as soon as humanly possibly
so that we can all surf the cyberwave on KID_TORTURE....which is
hosted from 163/551

    Yes, we aren't your run of the mill "I hate children"  type
people. No.  We are the folks who love to yank Junior's hair...and
then swing him/her around in the air by it before releasing said
infant into a substantial firmament...such as a concrete wall.  We are
creative, caring, loving compassionate people who just plain despise
children.

    We discuss such interesting topics as...

    *- How to train a pit bull to 'play' with your toddler.

    *- Using your belt for discipline.

    *- Making your own kiddie-porn!

    *- How to humiliate a child with a simple trip to the barber.

    *- Hiding razor blades in Halloween candy.

     AND MORE!

    *- Luring children into your car without arousing suspicion

    *- Stealing and selling children for profit.

    *- Seldom used child labour laws that could actually turn your
       hobby into a golden opportunity to earn cash and make the "big
       time"!

    I would appreciate a response ASAP from all of the kid hating
sysops out there so that we can get this thing moving.  We need to get
on the backbone so that we can share our tips and hints with all of
the other kid-o-phobes and start making this a great nation like it
was intended.  People point their fingers at the liberals and demorats
and accuse them of bringing this country down, but I happen to know
that it is those damn rugrats.

A Stop-Gap Suggestion For The Nodelist

from Lester Garrett
FidoNews 11-27                 Page: 14                    34 Jun 1994

I suspect this is not likely to sit well with many, but how about
this as a stop-gap measure for reducing the size of the ever-growing
NodeList until a better solution can be agreed upon.

Why not eliminate all BBS names from the Nodelist?  And in order to
avoid breaking current software, replace them with a single character
place-marker in the BBS name field.  While most of us are probably
quite fond of our BBS' names, is there really any _need_ for them in
the Nodelist?  And nothing prevents us from keeping them in our Origin
lines and elsewhere.

Well, just a thought.

New Remote Access <==> UUCP utility confusion

Fredric L. Rice
The Skeptic Tank (1:102/890.0)

The Skeptic Tank has been getting quite a few messages and telephone
calls from individuals who have reviewed the new release of Remote
Access and have found a stand-alone, third-party software package
called RAUUCP which provides gatework between a UUCP host and the
Remote Access system; they think it's my software package (first
released 1992)called UUCP-RA and there is some confusion.

This short note, I hope, will help end the confusion.  UUCP-RA works
on the Remote Access *.BBS message files and FidoNet *.MSG message
files. It doesn't work on JAM or any other format and it doesn't dial
the UUCP host directly.  It scans Remote Access' RA/RBBS *.BBS
folder(s) for mail destined for Internet and creates *.MSG files
addressed to a UUCP<===>FidoNet gateway.  It then scans the inbound
FidoNet *.MSG network mail directory for internet messages and creates
messages in a Remote Access folder.

The result of UUCP-RA is that users on Remote Access systems may send
and recieve Internet mail easilly providing a front-end like Front Door
is on top of things performing the mailing.  UUCP-RA does the
translations and allows the rest of the SysOps software have their way
with the result.

The newest version of Remote Access has included in its release, it
seems, a software package which takes this idea and expands upon it
by allowing the UUCP host to be called directly -- I'm not certain
what is done as I've not reviewed the release.

What is certain is that I am unable to answer questions about the
software package which comes with the new Remote Access release.  It
does not apear as though it duplicates the utility of UUCP-RA so I
will continue to provide functionality updates to UUCP-RA whenever
requested.  (Indeed, I'm back in the United States and can attend
FidoNews 11-27                 Page: 15                    34 Jun 1994

such things now.)

UUCP-RA.LZH is currently at version 1.8 and may be FileRequested
24 hours a day from The Skeptic Tank, 1:102/890.0. (818) 335-9601.
If you have a question about the other software package, don't ask
me, I am not responsible.  <smile>

A Report on Guams Trials and tribulations

Contributor: Todd Cochrane  6:670/6

          A Report on Guams Trials and tribulations
               Guam, Fido, Internet, Guahanet

Guam were the %@&# is Guam well that is the response most of us
here have heard from time to time. Guam is approx 7500 miles SW
of Hawaii. Luckily Guam is the Hub for several TransPacific Fiber
Cables. Thus data communications are possible at normal transfer
speeds...

A group of us decided a few years ago that we wanted to bring the
world of fido to our 650 plus users. But the history of making that
possible was interesting. Our troubles started In 1991 when Guahnet
(our local network) attempted to get initial node numbers. We were
treated like ROTTEN STEP CHILDREN that had the PLAUGE no one wanted.

We first went to Hawaii and they helped us out reluctantly in
getting initial node numbers. Then about a month later the Fido
FidoNews 11-27                 Page: 16                    34 Jun 1994

Power Mongers decided that Guam a US territory should not be in Zone
1. They then deleted us from the Nodelist!!  We sent Netmail messages
off to Australia and Japan to see who wanted the Guam bastard children
we really felt that way. After several months we ended up in Zone 6
and have had permanent node numbers since...

Getting the final Node numbers took over a year. I bet were the only
US Territory to have a Zone 6 node number, 6:671 to be exact.

Like all networks outside the Continental US getting Echo-Mail
is a pain.  1. Calling Japan cost over $2.00 per minute  2. Calling
Australia was over $3.00 per minute. 3. Calling the Mainland is $1.00
per minute. Easy choice go with the Mainland. The second problem was
to find a system that was willing to feed us Echo Mail. Thank goodness
for old friends and the cooperative network our feed belongs to.

The cost are still hard to swallow We were running bills as high as
$1000.00 monthly on long distance We have been lucky to pull a few
dozen echos on a CRP. The majority of Guam BBS Operators are military
and do not have a high amount of disposable income. Plus military
folks move every 2-3 yrs thus we changed host for awhile like one
would change under ware.

Then the Internet came to Guam at a semi affordable price (Thank God)
Several of us Sysops have set up UUCP feeds and started sucking on
usenet and reliable E-mail like it was going out of style. Because of
the small amount of Fido Echo mail and the cost to bring it in
anything was great. Being most of us have grew up on Fido Echo Mail
we missed the clean almost always on topic Echo mail.  Just imagine
yourself pulling the full backbone one week none for the next year
then only getting a few dozen echos for another year it SUCKS..

We may have come up with a solution to the lack of Fido Echo Mail
since the Internet provider recently has established a full time
57.6k line to the Mainland. We are going to pull the full load
through the Internet via a UUCP connection to the host then pump it
to the network and distribute like everyone else. It is my
understanding that Zone 2 & 6 receive there echo mail this way now
with permission from all parties involved.

Easy enough but now the quandary continues most of the Major BBS
here are once again on the move including myself. Back to the states
(jumping for joy) the land of the stable power supply and low long
distance cost.  Were a Fido feed is Usually a local call away.

The users want the entire backbone the Sysops want it also. So with
luck and a little patience it will happen. So this is a small segment
of Fido in Guam I believe the Network is here to stay and will
continue to grow.

To those of you that really helped us in beginning Thank you. For
the ZC's & RC's that told us to bugger off well I would hope when
some other small territory or country get's online that you help them
instead of thumbing your noses..

I am a Sysop on the move.  I have a added note people complain
about systems that are flagged DOWN in the nodelist well we will be
DONE for 6 weeks. If you have ever moved it is a lot easier to get a
new node number if you already have one.

Look forward to coming to the 1:2612 area and fighting the looming
echo mail delivery and associated cost there..  If you have been
following the Fido Echo's you will know what I am referring too..

Dearest MADam Emilia,

Q:  What do you think of using net resources to "find" people who
don't want to be found?

A:  Please be VERY careful.  It is not nice to muck with the
privacy of any individual.  Even if you are careful, have great
intentions, are a wonderful person, you might assist in developing
tools which could be used by idiots.

Q:  I have read rumours that Tim Pozar is no longer IC of F I D O
N E T.  Could this possibly be true?

A:  To solve this issue once and for all, Tim Pozar is not now and
always will be IC.

Q:  I am extremely bothered by use of the terms "seduce",
"masochism"  and "bitch with a nice ass" in the last issue of
Fidonews.  I am hotly upset.  Say something to appease my
indignation.  I do not want my children to read such obnoxious
verbiage.

A:  Try reading a Fredudian analysis of Grimms Fairy Tales, and
then justify to me your attidude about censorship.  Also, try
reading the dictionary.  "Seduce" can mean "coax" or "tempt", as in
"seduced by the smell of coffee".  Masochism can mean "the
enjoyment of what appears to be painful or tiresome".  A "bitch
with a nice ass" can mean a female dog with a lovely donkey for a
pet.  You chose what you want to read, even while reading particualar
text written by someone else.  What do you mean by "bothered"?
The difference between connotation and dennotation is variable
and potentially vast.

Q:  Stop patronizing me.

A:  k.  But you did ask.  Would you prefer me lying??

Announcing Creation of ASKAPI

by Ted Barker, co-sysop Clink Communication
Moderated by Bob Croslin-Sysop

This is the first opportunity I have had to reach out to
the entire Fido network regarding a pet project of
mine: ASKAPI.

Essentially, I am letting all of you bbsers out there know
of the existance of an echo that has been localized on
Bob Croslin's fine Dallas BBS, the PIBBS or more well known
as Private Eye's:214-475-8708.

ASKAPI is a general interest echo for PI's and the public
at large to discuss the Investigative bussiness.

The host bbs is a special interest group oriented bbs
for the Private Investigative community to exchange
information and to relax as well.

Other doors on the host bbs have Legal Reform issues and
I co-sysop that area. Message bases for the Sierra Club,
diverse games, and a private Adult area, for those who
choose adult topics.

But, the reason for writing today is to generate interest
or focus attention on the need for a Private Investigative
echo on Fido. General public questions regarding domestic
uses of PI's, "how to" questions, and assisting adoptees or
the "skip-outs" that make up the daily grind in the business.

Serious needs for regional data easily accessed on Bob's bbs
can be queried on the echo. This is not an endorsement for
any particular PI or investigative person, rather an example
of what may transpire on such an echo.

How to assist? How about you sysops that have interest start
polling the echo locally in North Texas for starters. Any
support should lead to getting to the backbone where everyone
in Fidoland could take part.

You end users can ask for the support of your sysops. Get them
to carry the feed. Get out there and learn something of what
goes on in Private Investigating.

Thanks for lending an ear, I certainly hope to see this take
off.

By the way, the PIBBS is one of the longest running BBS's in
North Texas. Bob has been using TBBS as his window on the
world now for nine years. He is a great sysop and patient with
all who ask questions regarding the PI business.
