   Perhaps every failed policy complaint should require that
the filer resign for annoying the person that must process it.
After all, if the policy complaint failed, then the complainer
was too easily annoyed, by definition.

   People that cannot behave in a civilized fashion are annoying
to most people.  The page down key is available to every single
person in fidonet.

Philosofical research of Germers Message

Hydiho Editors!

I just read the article of Bob Germer in FNews1224. I am currently
finishing my essay in my study as philosophical researcher of
old captain-logs, government documentents in the 17th century and
other human handwriting.

This also involves making statements of the writers of criminal
letters. You can think of criminals who wrote letters, or even
people who waided through newspapers, cut big bright shiney capitals
out of it and compose these capitals into sentences and even
complete letters without making grammatical errors.

These people write these kinds of letters to get $100000 from you
for something you really don't need, blackmail you or just because
they like to frighten people.

Although I cannot see Bobs handwriting, I can see some extraordinary
ways of reasoning in his written message. I have studied his paper for
over two hours now, and I think I already have deducted a few very
interesting aspects. Instead of boring you with all kinds of silly
little details and naming all these aspects I wish to make the
final statement directly in the following paragraph.

The only thing I can extract out of B. Germers message is that this
person does not want to frighten anybody, neither does he want money
in court, and he doesn't look like a criminal either. He is just a
plain fool.

The best way to cope with this is to totally ignore him and don't
spend any attention at this person in your issues of Fidonews. This
should be easy because this person isn't in the Net anyway. I also
recommend to withdraw any conference names with "GERMER" in it, just
to make certain not to wake this unnecesary thread ever again. Let's
close this now and for good.

Thank you for your attention,

    Greetings from the Netherlands,

As always, I was and remain utterly correct

Fredric L. Rice

When I first suggested the immediate ejection of any BLOTTED-
BLOT who spouts/threatens 'lawsuit' to FidoNet SysOps, the
positive response was overwhelming and only one critic stepped
forward publically in FidoNews to rebutt the Policy addition.

At the time I warned that the spewers of ideological hatred
would be the eventual death of FidoNet as a viable, useful
hobby.  They can't win an argument rationally because their
positions of hatred are undefendable.  They can't win in the
courts but they're not _interested_ in winning: They rely upon
the S.L.A.P.P. lawsuit -- intimidation and financial ruin to
'win' their undefendable positions.  The spewers of hatred
know that the bright, positive, happy, fulfilled individuals
they target will rightfully judge the effort of defense and
quietly bow out.

My fears have certainly been vindicated, haven't they?

As usual the religious zealots among us can't be happy with
both the freedom and the enjoyment the rest of us experience
in our hobbies (FidoNet is but one positive human achievement
under attack by superstitious ignorants) and they've got to
beshit and befoul the honest, loving, positive, hard-working
among us due to their petty, religion-demanding hatred, spite,
and resentment of all that's positive.

FidoNet mistake number 1 was the vote to disband the IFNA
        which could have been used to successfully counter
        the bastards among us.

FidoNet mistake number 2 was the abolishment of a yearly
        dues to be listed in the nodelist payable to the
        IFNA.  These monies could have also been used to
        successfully counter the bastards among us.

FidoNet mistake number 3 is the continued lack of any Policy
        statement strictly forbidding the threats of legal
        actions, making the offense grounds for immediate
        ejection.  All SysOps who wish to be listed in the
        nodelist is already supposed to read Policy 4 and,
        if they agree with the terms, submit their request.
        Any threat of legal action against another SysOp with
        the rule in effect would have been a clear violation
FidoNews 12-25                 Page:  4                    19 Jun 1995

        of the agreement which resulted in connectivity.

FidoNet mistake number 4 is to continue to allow ejected
        individuals (and entire systems of individuals) access
        to FidoNet and even at times to allow ejected
        individuals back into the network.  All decisions
        should be final.  Joining gated 'alternative' nets
        should not bea loophole for allowing ejected fucks
        from still participating in FidoNet unhindered.

0-=

I want to see Policy 5 ammended and then voted upon.  I want to
see George Peace come back and I would like to see everyone
petition Mike Fuchs to continue in his work and ask him to not
let the perpetuators of hatred win.

There's already enough hate-spewers winning in the real world.

DogCollar: making PGP safe for FidoNet
by Frank J. Perricone, 1:325/611.0

Not long ago, a childish prat tried to get me in trouble by
impersonating me and sending netmails to various people using my
name, my EMSI signature, and even, to the very limited ability
he had, my style of writing. You can't imagine, if you haven't
been through this, what it's like to know that you can never
know what the next thing you'll be accused of is, that it just
takes one chemically-imbalanced dweeb and some freeware, and all
the reputation you've built over years is gone.

The only solution is PGP clearsigning your messages, and making
sure everyone knows that you do.  But there's a problem.
FidoNet does not in general smile upon PGP signatures. Most
moderators refuse to allow it. Many of the rest only allow it
for people for whom it is already too late, those already under
attack. If you cave into these pressures, there is no longer
any point to using it ANYWHERE because the forger can always get
to you in the places you don't use it.

Why is it forbidden? I'm usually told because of bandwidth.  I
counter by pointing out that receiving 100 PGP-signed messages
every day would cost you an additional $0.30 per month, using a
v.34 modem. But still people object to the waste of bandwidth.
I think the fact that the signature is splayed out in their
faces is the more important part -- if they saw how big those
SEEN-BYs were, they would have other pennies to pinch, I think.

Either way, I have a solution: DogCollar.  This is a program
which compresses a PGP-clearsigned Fido message, eliminating
almost 20% of the PGP overhead; and it hides the remainder
behind kluge lines, except one tiny indicator to let the reader
know that the message has been "collared". Use it again to
FidoNews 12-25                 Page:  5                    19 Jun 1995

"uncollar" before PGP-verifying the signature.

My DogCollar.lha archive contains MS-DOS and Amiga executables,
and the source code included is pure ANSI stdio-based C, so
recompiling for other platforms should be child's play. At
present the only message base format it knows is the venerable
FTS-0001, Fido's own standard; but the code was designed to make
it easy to integrate support for other message base formats, so
if you're a programmer using another format, I need your help.

Please FREQ DogCollar.lha from me, distribute it far and wide,
and help me expand its domain to all platforms, all message base
formats. Maybe using this we can recapture our right to freedom
on our Net.

Madam Emila confessional v.2

Hello!  Someone wants to sue me for publishing indiscriminately,
so i have to tell you my "real" name.  Madam Emilia is Sylvia
Maxwell.  "Maxwell" is my pen name which i have been using for
over ten years and i consider it to be real.  I never wanted to
use an alias as a scapegoat, and before this lawsuit problem I have
never felt compelled to tell anyone my legal name.  It is Sylvia
"Morscher", and i live at 128 Church Street, Kitchener, Ontario, N2G 2S4,
voice phone 519-570-3137 (ask for Sylvia or Max, both of whom are me).

Also, i am wondering why i am am still formatting Fidonews to be
72 chars a line or less.  Do i still have to do this?

    Connecticut this week  put teeth into  a new law  designed to
    stop  any  harassment  on  the  internet,  including fidonet.
    Three cheers  for the  yankees!   No tolerating  any of  this
    stuff!
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    Harassment law enters cyberspace Conn. moves to keep  on-line
    in line

    HARTFORD  (AP)--Connecticut  has  decided  to  delve into the
    high-tech world  of cyberspace  to outlaw  over the  computer
    what   has   long   been   illegal   over  the  telephone  or
    old-fashioned  "snail  mail":    ha-  rassing  or threatening
    messages.  Gov.  John G. Rowland has signed a law making it a
    felony to "harass, annoy, alarm or terrorize" another  person
    over  the  computer--a  law  proponents contend merely brings
    Connecticut law up  to date with  the latest technology,  but
    critics main- tain is an overreaction born out of ignora,nce.
    "I don't think there's anything es- pecially sinister"  about
    the new  law, said  Rep.   Patricia Dillon,  D- New  Haven, a
    frequent user of the  Prodigy on-line service and  the bill's
FidoNews 12-25                 Page:  6                    19 Jun 1995

    sponsor.    "It  simply  brings  existing  law  in to the 21s
    tcentury."   The new  law goes  into effect  Oct. 1. But even
    proponents are unsure how it would be enforced and whether it
    would  apply  to  computer  users  outside of Connecticut who
    happen to target harassing  messages to state residents.   It
    already is  illegal to  harass or  threaten someone  over the
    tele- phone or by mail,  which is known by computer  users as
    "snail mail."  Computer users who do the same will be subject
    to up to three years in  prison and a $500 fine.   And people
    already convicted of a felony would face up to five years  in
    prison  and  a  $5,000  fine.    The  issue  came to Dillon's
    attention during  her daily  visits to  Prodi- gy,  where she
    does  research  for  legislation  and  discovered  strings of
    messages devoted to a case involving a user known as  "Vito,"
    who targeted  a woman  via E-mail  and the  system's bulletin
    board system.

    The  man  was  posting  messages  that  had  a   "terrifying,
    immobilizing  effect  on  the  victim"  by claiming her son's
    mental retardation was a result of fetal alcohol syndrome and
    accusing her of being promiscuous Dillon said.

    Although the  various on-line  services monitor  messages for
    profane language  or conversations  deemed unfit  for a  wide
    audience, Dillon said the  government needs to go  further to
    try to protect users of computer bulletin boards.

    "At one point,  we were worshiping  the Internet ...  and now
    there's been a backlash so it's been demonized," Dillon said.
    "I don't think  it's either one,"  but it's worth  protecting
    people who use computers.

    However, civil libertarians and some experts in the field  of
    computers and law believe Connecticut may be going overboard.

    William Olds, the executive director of the Connecticut Civil
    Liberties Union, said  recently that the  harassment statutes
    already are troublesome because they're vague.

    "What  is  alarming  to  one  person  may  not be alarming to
    another," Olds said.

    It also  begins to  restrict a  key benefit  of the Internet:
    its unfettered flow of ideas and information, Olds and others
    said.
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Will Connecticut set  the pace on  the I-Way and  become it's
    street sweeper?  Could be if they can maintain this pace.

Scary future??

by Fredrik Bennison
2:205/300,  fredrik.bennison@rosebay.ct.se

What is FidoNet coming to??  After reading FidoNews 1223 and 1224 I am
for the first time seriously worried about what is happening in Zone1.
Of course, I've heard from time to time that it is a different net
over there, that it is a much harsher environment and that you have to
watch your back all the time.  I didn't believe that it could be so,
perhaps I didn't want to believe that, I know of no such troubles here
in Zone2.  But when I read that people are resigning because of some
fellow sysop threatening them with lawsuits I began to see that
perhaps there is something definitely wrong within Zone1.

And now in FNews 1224 I read that Bob Germer threatens FidoNews with a
lawsuit and that an NC has had a sysop in his net arrested for
harrassment, claiming that his questions are excessively annoying.

For the sake of the future of FidoNet, I hope that this settles down
soon and that we won't have to be bullied by some sysop's threats. This
network is all about communication, or at least it should be, we should
try to solve things through communicating and not through the courts.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Fido IS.
What Fido IS.                         Richard Ratledge 1:119/88
 -One person's perception.                              June 95

I have been doing a lot of thinking about what FidoNet really is.
Mostly in response to the recent resignation of George Peace from
the International Coordinator position and Mike Fuch's decision
to stop publishing the EchoList. Here is what I have come up
with. If you don't agree, please let me know and we can hash it
out. :-)

To me there are two ways to look at FidoNet and a lot of the
disagreement flying around is because people try to put both
views together. FIRST: FidoNet IS the structure defined in Policy
4. That includes the Coordinator structure, the Nodelist,
Fidonews and all the individual systems. That is ALL FidoNet is,
nothing more, nothing less. But SECOND: Fido is a whole heck of a
lot more. It has gobs of 'content.' Content such as the message
echo areas and the file areas and some stuff I don't even know
about. Many people insist that the second definition is the one
that is correct and believe it is what defines FidoNet.

I maintain that both views are correct. Just make certain that
you stay clear about which part of the definition you are working
from when you start making assertions about how things should be
handled in "Fidonet." Be careful not to confuse the content part
with the structure part.
FidoNews 12-25                 Page:  8                    19 Jun 1995


My opinion is that there is little problem with the primary
definition of FidoNet. Policy 4 may need a bit of updating. I
just read through it and I see very little that is in need of
major overhaul. BUT. When you start working from the second
definition of Fido there is a huge amount of structure that is
not well defined. The role of the various mechanisms providing
the content to Fido is unclear to many of us who are involved in
FidoNet. This lack of clarity leads to some MAJOR disagreements.

This is what I see happening in Zone 1 (other Zones are vastly
different, I am sure). FidoNet and the structure defined in the
nodelist, IS FidoNet. Then there are the Backbone, the Moderators
of each of the Echos and various message and file Distribution
Systems. The Backbone has taken on the responsibility of
shepherding the echos along. The Backbone has created a structure
that parallels the structure of FidoNet itself. They have a ZEC,
REC's and NEC's just like FidoNet has a ZC, RC's and NC's. No
wonder it gets confused with FidoNet! Especially since some
positions are filled by the same person in both structures. The
Backbone has created it's own Policy document, Backbone Operating
Policy or BOP. It may be policy but it isn't binding on FidoNet
itself since only Policy 4 affects Fidonet (they may be merged
someday but that is a different matter). Then there are the
individual Moderators of the many separate echos. They also
operate independently. They control the content of their echos
and who is allowed to access the areas. Within the context of the
particular echo the Moderator 'is god.' The Moderator has to
decide where they want the echo to go. Usually for a
wide-interest subject it is placed on the backbone. Doesn't have
to be, but that is where the most exposure within Fido will
occur. About Distribution Systems -- there are a multitude of
them currently and there will be more to come. All the way from
private distribution node-to-node to Planet Connect to the
ftphub. The Backbone itself is the mother of all distribution
systems. Distribution Systems are a non-issue sort of thing.
There is some concern about commercial enterprises making money
by distributing Fido content but most of those concerns have been
satisfied. I left out individual systems and users but their role
is hopefully obvious, although probably the most important in all
of the net.

That is where we are at. What needs to be done? There are some
structural things that should be straightened out. I would like
to see more definitions of the role of Moderators and what
authority the Backbone has in relation to feed cuts versus the
moderators' authority. Making it crystal clear to everyone
concerned who orders and enforces these things would be a great
boon to the net. There are a million details still to work out
and many things that will let all this work smoother, in general
though it works the way it is. Recent events have some people
greatly concerned. I am not terribly concerned, mostly because I
see a lot of insight coming from the people responsible for
making decisions. I am sorry to see a few people who are less
than friendly and cooperative. I tend to agree with Christopher
FidoNews 12-25                 Page:  9                    19 Jun 1995

Baker that 'friendly and cooperative' should be a requirement to
remain in FidoNet.

Anyway, that is where I am at in my assessment of FidoNet.
Hopefully I am not too far out in left field. Maybe it provides
just a glimmer of illumination to those who don't quite
understand it. Not really sure I do yet! :-)

PS. I don't claim any copyright to this. Do with it what you
like. :-) RR

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just one question

Rev. Shawn McMahon
1:3806/0

I just have one question for the Backbone in general, and for Z1EC
Bruce Bodger in particular.

This is just a question, not an accusation nor an attempt to take
sides.

How are Z1_WINTERS and it's ilk improper titles for an echo, but
OJ_SIMPSON isn't inappropriate?

Does the protection against having one's name on an echo extend only
to personal friends and people who threaten lawsuits, or can we
expect that it'll be applied to all echoes with a person's name in
them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

OS/2 archiver test

Rev. Shawn McMahon
1:3806/0

I recently did another test of archivers.  Just thought I'd share it
with everybody; perhaps it might save somebody some time or money.

New set of assumptions this time:

1) Only OS/2 archivers were tested.  Although DOS ones run great under
OS/2, making the OS/2 session wait on them is a bit of a pain so I
didn't bother.

2) Test subject was over 800k of Fidonet .PKT files, containing several
echoes and a couple of pieces of netmail.

3) Since all I was testing was Fidonet performance, I didn't bother
timing things.  In general, the smaller the archive, the longer it took
to make it.  This is especially true for HA and Hpack.  I figured that
the time to archive them was trivial compared to the time to transfer

them over phone lines.

4) I didn't test them on nodelists or nodediffs; I'm not trying to get
anybody to adopt a new standard here, just pointing out what's available
for your own echomail.

5) This list, although broad, is only representative.  There may be
other OS/2 archivers out there that I haven't tested.  For instance, I
didn't go through the gyrations of playing with ports of Unix COMPRESS
and TAR, because I doubt anybody bothers with them for Fidonet mail when
ZIP and Hpack are available for both OS/2 and Unix.

with the filenames stated as shown.  Archiver versions are listed before

ARC comes in fifth in my experience, with the rest being fairly
platform-dependant.  In fact, ARJ and RAR weren't even available for
OS/2 until recently.

All of these listed have DOS counterparts.  I know for certain that ZIP,
Hpack, and ZOO have Unix counterparts.  I've seen ZIP-alikes for most
other common computers, as well as Hpack compiles for everything that's
got a ZIP version.

If your favorite archiver isn't listed, and you have OS/2 executables,
let me know.  I'll be glad to FREQ them on my nickle.  I'm especially
looking for OS/2 versions (especially unpackers) for the more
platform-specific archivers, such as the plethora of Mac-specific ones.

A Solution to the Nodelist Problem

by Joel C. Maslak

A Solution to the Nodelist Problem
----------------------------------

     A problem which has plagued Fidonet since its very beginning is
that of the Nodelist.  I have documentation dating from 1988 which
indicates problems with the St. Louis Nodelist Format (Baker 12-14).
Since 1988, there have been over 65 articles published in the "Fido
News" relating to the Nodelist (complete list of works consulted is
not published, to save space.  Contact me at the address listed at the
end of this article for a copy).

     Other proposals have been submitted, including one from Robert
Heller, which support a Internet-style Domain Name Service for
Fidonet.  Unfortunately, Mr. Heller was ahead of his time.  The
Fidonet community was not (and is still not) ready for his suggested
changes.  While I'm not sure what the Fidonet reaction will be to my
suggested changes, I am publishing the results of over a year of
research in the hope that it is adopted as a standard.

     This research originally began as an attempt to "give something
back" to the Fidonet community.  It later developed into a research
project which was entered into the International Science and
Engineering Fair (Maslak, "Roadblocks...") as well as the Wyoming
Junior Science & Humanities Symposium (Maslak, "Distributed...").

     What follows is a modified version of my research report.  Many
FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 12                    19 Jun 1995

sections which describe the basic workings of Fidonet have been
omitted, while other sections, describing more advanced topics, such
as the details of the data files, have been added.

=================================================================

Nodelist Problems

     One of Fidonet's biggest problems is its extraordinary rate of
growth.  Between the months of July 1993 and July 1994, Fidonet grew
over 30 percent!  In the month of April 1995, a Nodediff was released
with a size, compressed, of 519,152 bytes.  During the single week
ending April 7, 1995, Fidonet grew by 1,600 systems.  During the
entire month of April, over 2,000 systems were added to the Nodelist.
This is extraordinary growth.  (Note: Some Nodelist statistics were
taken from Mr. Bush's article entitled, "A Review of the Fidonet
Nodelist.")

=================================================================

Distributed Node Information Database

     To solve problems with the nodelist, a distributed node
information database was developed.  This system would allow for Net
Information Segments to be stored on systems throughout Fidonet.  The
Net Information Segments contain nodelist information for systems
within a net.  The Net Information Server would distribute the
segments via the Fidonet FREQ system.  The Net Information Server
would be filled by the node in the position of Net Coordinator.  For
example, the segment for net one in zone one could be requested from
1:1/0.  The segment for net 10 in zone one can be requested from
1:10/0.  Then segment for zone three, net 103 in zone one can be
requested from 3:103/0.

     A program was then written to scan for outbound mail.  Should
this program find a message with an unknown destination address, it
requests the appropriate net information segment from the net
coordinator of the net for which information is desired.  Upon receipt
of the segment, the required node entry is merged into the local
nodelist, which is used by the Fidonet software to establish contacts
with other Fidonet systems.  This is accomplished by using two
programs, as shown below.  These programs, together with the actual
project research, took a total of 12 months to complete, and, for that
reason, are relatively complex.  Complete listings can be found in the
research notebook.  Contact the author via Internet E-mail at
jmaslak@cchs.ccsd.k12.wy.us, or, via Fidonet CRASH MAIL (routed mail
will not reach this network), Joel Maslak@1:316/23.

     Although the programs which were written contact the appropriate
NC, as listed above, the test procedures did not exploit this
capability.  Instead, the testing procedures were modeled after the
"transitional mode."  In the transitional mode, some systems would
still keep the entire nodelist, allowing all net segments to be
requested from just one system.  Because of financial concerns, and
because such a system would have to exist until all nets implemented a
FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 13                    19 Jun 1995

Net Information Server, this was thought to be a valid test.

=================================================================

Net Information Segment Format

     The Net Info Segment is very similar to the traditional nodelist,
except all lines relating to systems outside of the network have been
deleted.  Note that the Net Info Segment for a region includes only
regional independents, not members of individual nets.  Note that the
segment for a zone includes zone independents as well as both Regional
and Network Coordinators.  Neither Regional Independents nor nodes
belonging to local nets are listed in this file.

Files are named according to the following:

xxxxyyyy.nl

     xxxx - Hex number representing ZONE (it is this large to allow
for non-Fido zones to use this standard).

     yyyy - Hex number representing NET

Example: 00010068.NL (net 1:104)  <long lines are wrapped>

NODELIST.400 <local nodelist> Format

     Nodelist.400 is a current list of Fidonet local nets, as well as
all nodes within the local net.  It is merged with info from Net Info
FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 14                    19 Jun 1995

Segments to form a 'personal phonebook' of systems which the node
contacts.  For more info, contact me.

=================================================================

Format of LIST.NIR

     It is a comma-deliminated file listing nodes for which net info
segments have been requested.

Example:

2,2,4

In the example, info segments for systems 1:23/162, 1:42/252, and
2:2/4 were requested.  Note that since this file is only stored on the
local system, it's format is not relevent.  It is presented here for
the sole purpose of documenting the test site's software.

=================================================================

Hypothesis

     It was hypothesized that the distributed nodelist would be as
reliable as a non-distributed nodelist for the purpose of establishing
a connection with a remote Fidonet system.  Thus, as it provides a
significantly smaller list of Fidonet systems, it should be adopted by
the citizens of the Fidonet network.

=================================================================

Phase I: Test Procedure

     This test used the distributed node information database system
outlined previously.  The purpose of this test is to determine the
feasibility of the distributed node information database.

     Two groups of 20 nodes were chosen randomly, using a custom
computer program.  These nodes were from the population of Fidonet
nodes in the continental US.  Thus a total of 40 nodes were picked, 20
in the control group, and 20 in the experimental group.

     The nodes in the control group were sent a Fidonet file request.
The nodes were then either placed in the 'successful' or
'unsuccessful' group depending upon the success of the initial
contact.  The control group used the normal Fidonet nodelist to
establish the connection.

     The nodes in the experimental group were also sent a Fidonet
Freq.  The nodes were then either placed in the 'successful' or
'unsuccessful' groups, as described above.  A distributed nodelist was
used to establish the connection for this group.  For this feasibility
study, all net information segments were stored on 1:316/19 (note:
This system is no longer accepting incoming Fidonet Netmail).  In
actual practice, the net information segments would be stored on
various boards throughout the network.

FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 16                    19 Jun 1995

     Results were then compiled, using the BinkleyTerm log.  All
connections which were successful were grouped into the 'SUCCESSFUL
CONNECTION' category, while others were placed in the 'UNSUCCESSFUL
CONNECTION' category.   Connections were determined to be successful
if a session handshake took place.

=================================================================

Phase I: Test Results
    CONTROL GROUP
    - 15 Successful connections
    -  5 Unsuccessful connections
    = 75% Success Rate

    EXPERIMENTAL GROUP
    - 16 Successful connections
    -  4 Unsuccessful connections
    = 80% Success Rate

=================================================================

Phase I: Discussion

     This project did not test the distributed nodelist system fully.
The distributed nodelist standard currently does not allow the Net
Information Server to be a system other than the Net Coordinator.
This poses a problem because many net coordinators run busy systems.
It may be difficult to connect to such a system, delaying the
transmission of the net information segment.  This, in turn, would
delay delivery of Netmail.  Thus, in large nets, it may be appropriate
to have dedicated Net Information Servers.  The problem with this is
that, currently, there is no method of signifying a net information
server in the nodelist.

     It is believed that the small difference between the control and
experimental group is not due to the method of how the nodelist is
stored, but that it is due to the variation of systems in Fidonet.
From this research, it can be determined that this project would be
technically feasible.

     One interesting fact which was discovered during the process of
testing is that the Fidonet's perception of the nodelist is quite
different that the reality of the nodelist.  Fidonet believes that the
nodelist is updated frequently, and very few systems in the nodelist
are represented incorrectly.  In actuality, many systems listed in the
nodelist could not be contacted.  This indicates a problem with the
nodelist, as it may be too large to be easily managed.  A distributed
nodelist may be easier to maintain, as a dedicated position would be
created - the Net Information Server.  This server's only
responsibility would be to maintain the nodelist.  Since that system
would not be the net coordinator, it would not be  required to settle
disputes, test to see if new nodes comply with Fidonet technical
specifications, nor to manage the network hubs. The system's only
responsibility would be to manage the net information segment.  A
person who wishes to maintain high integrity of the nodelist should be
FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 17                    19 Jun 1995

appointed/elected (I don't want to write policy).

=================================================================

Phase II: Test Procedure

     This test used the distributed node information database system
outlined previously.  The purpose of this test, like phase I, is to
determine the feasibility of the distributed node information
database.  This experiment is a further extension of the research
previously conducted in phase I.

     Unlike phase I, only one group, consisting of 100 nodes, was
chosen.  These nodes were each contacted once using the St. Louis
Nodelist and once using the Distributed Nodelist Standard.

     The nodes in the control group were sent a Fidonet file request
(for a file that does not exist).  The nodes were then either placed
in the 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' group depending upon the success
of the mail transfer, unlike phase I which determined success based
upon the negotiation of a session handshake immediately after a
connection is established.  The control group used the normal Fidonet
nodelist to establish the connection.

     The nodes in the experimental group were also sent a Fidonet file
request.  They were then placed in either the 'successful' or
'unsuccessful' group, as described above.  A distributed nodelist was
used to establish the connection for this group.  Like phase I, all
net information segments were stored on 1:316/19 (Note: This system no
longer accepts incoming Fidonet Netmail).  In actual practice, the net
information segments would be stored on various boards throughout the
network.

     Results were then compiled, using a custom program which
determined if the individual mail packets were sent successfully to
the receiving system.

=================================================================

Phase II: Results

     Control Group - Success Rate: 89%
     Experimental Group - Success Rate: 86%

=================================================================

Phase II: Discussion

     The results of this test were analyzed with a two-tailed T-test.
The results of the T-test appear to indicate that there was no
significant difference between the results of the control group and
those of the experimental group.  This would indicate that the
Distributed Nodelist Standard is a feasible alternative to the
Nodelist, based upon technological concerns.

FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 18                    19 Jun 1995

     The two groups, control and experimental, are a random sample of
the US Fidonet population, and representative of that population.
Since 100 systems were tested, a large base of data was collected.
This significantly reduces the possibility of these results being
attributed to chance, and this, indicates that the Distributed
Nodelist Standard was successful.

=================================================================

Phase I Compared to Phase II

     Several significant differences exist between Phase I and Phase
II.  First, Phase I used a control group which was independent of the
experimental group, which allows the possibility of variation between
groups affecting the results.  Phase II used only one sample of
systems, polled once to form the control group, and then pulled again,
using the Distributed standard instead of the St. Louis Standard, to
form the experimental group. This is one of the reasons that phase II
was conducted.  Phase I consisted of only 20 systems in each group.
Phase II used a larger sample size of 100 systems.  The larger sample
size limited the possibility of randomly choosing a sample group which
did not represent the master population.

     Two types of mailers were used in this project.  In Phase I,
BinkleyTerm 2.59 beta was chosen.  To demonstrate the ability of the
Distributed Nodelist Standard to function properly with a wide variety
of Fidonet systems.  The success of both phases serves to indicate
that the Distributed Nodelist Standard would, in fact, function
properly with various Fidonet mailers.

     The method of analyzing the results was also different.  In phase
I,  success was determined by analyzing session handshakes, which are
transmitted early in a Fidonet session.  Phase II determined success
based upon the transmission of a file request (FREQ).  If the request
was successfully sent, the trial was categorized as successful.

     To compare the phase I control group to the phase II control
group, the results from phase I were re-analyzed using the methods
used in phase II.  The phase I control had a success rate of 55%,
while the phase II control group had a success rate of 89%.  These
results, when analyzed with the T-test, show that  there was a
significant difference between the phase I and phase II control
groups.  The difference is attributed to the types of mailers used, as
this was the only variable to change between the control groups.
Thus, it appears that BinkleyTerm 2.59 beta may be less reliable than
Frontdoor 2.02.  Further research is warranted, though, as phase I
consisted of only 20 trials.

=================================================================

Conclusion

     It can be concluded that, based on the success of this
experiment, that further experimentation is warranted.  The standard
tested in this project appears to have worked successfully.  A system
FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 19                    19 Jun 1995

similar to this would not require Fidonet software to be rewritten.
This would ease the transition from the St. Louis nodelist format to
the distributed nodelist format.  As the software used for the testing
procedures has been donated to the public domain, others can freely
use it without fear of legal action.  This project also discovered, by
accident--not design--that the current state of nodelist management is
not successful, when compared to commonly held beliefs.  Also by
accident, this project determined that a flaw may exist in the
BinkleyTerm software, a very popular Fidonet mailer.  Further research
should be conducted to test this hypothesis.

=================================================================

Statistical Analysis

     The test statistic of phase I was -.36972.  The absolute value of
this statistic is less than 1.684, the value for the 90% level of
confidence.  Thus, the difference observed in phase I was not
significant.

     The test statistic of phase II was .63887.  Since .63887 is less
than 1.645, no statistically significant difference, within a 90%
level of confidence, occurred.  This indicates that the difference
observed in phase II was not significant.

     The comparison of phase I and phase II's control group yielded a
test statistic of -3.3669.  Since the absolute value of this statistic
is greater than 1.960, the hypothesized value for 95% confidence, the
difference was significant.  This indicates that some event, which
occurred between phase I and phase II, may have caused a significant
difference in the chance of a successful connection.

were very cooperative and enjoyed being a part of this research.  If
you would like a complete list of systems which participated, please
contact me via Internet E-mail at jmaslak@cchs.ccsd.k12.wy.us, or via
Fidonet CRASH MAIL (routed mail does not reach this net) at Joel
Maslak@1:316/23.

     I also would like to express my appreciation for the Fidonet
members who choose to visit my exhibit at the International Science &
Engineering Fair.  I enjoyed explaining my research to you.

What Is StormNet?

     StormNet is an alternative network for use with FidoNet compatible
software.  We pass messages back and forth both in netmail and in echomail
conferences.  In StormNet, each node is welcomed and assisted in many ways
by other StormNet members.  We have active echomail areas and a growing
file echo selection.  Our echomail traffic is growing every day, and are
now pulling more mail ever than before. StormNet has a friendlier
atmosphere than can be found in many other networks.

     StormNet has been in existence for over two years, and in that time,
has grown significantly.  Our membership has changed from an inexperienced
group of local nodes to a more mature group of people from all over the
United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.  Currently, we have over 600 nodes
in StormNet, and are expanding every week!

 * Why is StormNet here?

     StormNet was started for a few reasons.  When we created it, we wanted
to serve teens, adults, and others worldwide with a quality alternative
network that is relatively cheap to pull in.  Most of our high speed
transfers take less than a minute.  Although we prefer it, you don't have
to poll every day, we are flexible and will allow you to poll whenever you
like.  We want to serve you with the finest quality echomail and files for
you and your users.  We are considerably smaller than FidoNet, and
therefore do not have the overflow of mail/files often seen in its
conferences.  The average cost per month for one who pulls StormNet and
polls daily is around $6.00-7.00 within the US.

FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 22                    19 Jun 1995

 * What are the rules like?

     StormNet?  Rules?  You've got to be kidding me.  Well, it's not like
we don't have any rules; all of the rules in our policy statement basically
stem from one basic principle - "Be nice and use common sense." The
policy's specifics were written to outline some problems which may
potentially arise when people aren't nice and don't use common sense.

     The SNAC (StormNet Advisory Council) helps to ensure the smooth
running of StormNet affairs.  StormNet does not discriminate because of
age, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, beliefs, taste in
food, opinion on world politics, or favorite color.  We welcome anyone who
is interested in joining a fun network to try out StormNet.  We also don't
allow "bashing", spindling or other forms of mutilation of groups in our
newsletters, or any of our echos (excluding WAR_ZONE), and other parts of
our network.

 * What are the echos like?

     We have a variety of conferences to suit most needs.  If you are a
user of StormNet, or a node, you can request an echo if you feel it would
be active.  We have echos on many subjects, A to Z (as we say SN_A to
SN_Z).  We have a talented staff of moderators and co-moderators, and
combined with the efforts of our international echomail coordinator, keep
the network running smoothly.

 * Internet...  Yes, Internet!

     StormNet is now registered in the domain listings as "storm.net".  All
StormNet nodes can use our UUCP host to send messages anywhere on Internet
at no additional cost to you.

 * Vanity Internet addresses

    The StormNet International Internet Coordinator has just recently
allowed a "vanity" name that you can apply for once you join StormNet. This
can be just about anything, and saves typing.  For example,
"John.Doe@johnsbbs.storm.net" is alot easier to remember than
"John.Doe@f104.n192.usa.storm.net."

 * Support

     StormNet has support sites for different types of software.  We
currently have technical support nodes/echos for BinkleyTerm, EzyCom,
Maximus, RemoteAccess, Storm Watch Software, T.A.G., and TurboSoft.

     New technical support nodes for other software are permitted and
encouraged.  When you apply for technical support, you will get a flag in
the nodelist designating you as a support site.  You also get your name
added to the list of technical support nodes at the bottom of the nodelist.
And finally, you have the option to add file and message echos software you
support.

 * What we're looking for

FidoNews 12-25                 Page: 23                    19 Jun 1995

     StormNet is looking for nodes who want to pull in high quality
echomail at a relatively cheap price.  Ones who think they would like
StormNet to be on their BBSes or computers.

     We also are looking for new zones to create all the time.  StormNet is
not just limited to North America, other continents and countries are
already members, but we would like more.  We'd like to expand StormNet
worldwide, and we think that everyone would benefit from this and it would
strengthen relations and understanding between other nations.  It already
has.  With European and Asian nodes, StormNet has a very unique atmosphere
where you will regularly chat with people not in the same country, or
continent as you.  We are willing to work with you to install a new zone
in/on your country/continent.

     We are looking for Zone Hubs in Asia and other continents that we
don't already have.  Zone Hubs that have direct Internet connections can
get their mail sent to them via the Internet.  Offer only good for New
Zones and Zone Hubs at this time, however.

 * Why should I consider StormNet?

     We respect each and every StormNet member and his/her rights.  We
offer our services to all.  We have a great network setup.  We want all to
join and have a good time in the network that we have created.  We're proud
of our network. We offer a unique and quaint atmosphere not found on any
other network.  We guarantee it.

     If you have any questions, comments, or problems, feel free to contact
any of the nodes listed below.  We'd be glad to help you.
