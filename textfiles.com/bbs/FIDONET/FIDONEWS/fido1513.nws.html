     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     As stated in the last editorial (issue 12), I advised the general
     Fido population of the existance of the ZCC-PUBLIC echo.

     As of several days ago, the erstwhile moderator of the echo, Ward
     Dossche, Z2C, has announced that the echo is now "read only",
     despite his message on 16 Jan 1998 which indicated it to be an echo
     where posts could be made without allowing direct access to the
     ZCC echo.

     An interesting claim made is that it is 'customary' in Zone 2 to
     not respond in such an echo if a mere sysop, but the FTSC-PUBLIC
     echo operates in a similar manner, and no one in Zone 2 I've
     observed follows such a 'custom'.

     The interesting point is the interpretation of "openness".

     The claim Ward makes is that he is cross-posting his own messages
     into ZCC-PUBLIC as a gesture that he is 'more open' than other ZC
     members...but we have no direct proof that he is posting *all* of
     these.

     Likewise, the posting of messages of others, albeit as a quote, does
     tend to lend itself to manipulation of the actual context of the
     original message...One would only have to select particular quotes to
     fit one's responses, and whole new meanings could be made from the
     actual statements.

     As well, does such "openness" really benefit FidoNet?

     Do we wish to restrain people from discussing matters in private, in
     order to discover which way the sentiments go?

     If we force open private echoes, is the forced opening of private
     netmail far behind?

     Another reason to suspect someone who claims to be working in "your
     best interests"...once they start in your name, what does it take
     to stop them?

     If the ZCC were acting against the best interests of FidoNet, I would
     expect the members to speak out against that, and go public over the
     actions, but to force it open for no other reason than a self-serving
     need to force issues...?

     Sorry, I have trouble finding legitimacy and justification...your
     mileage may vary.

     In other news, a press release from the Virtual Museum finds its way
     into the editor's mailbox; Ward sends in his doomsday countdown; and
     Doc Logger rides again.

     Also, the debate over FTS-0001 comes up again, begging the question:
     FIDONEWS 15-13               Page 2                   30 Mar 1998


      "Do we update the software protocols and eliminate non-DOS/non-OS/2
       nodes, or do we let those running FTS-0001 only remain in Fido and
       hold us back from our hope and glory?"

     Your comments, as always, are invited.

     Virtual Museums on the Internet

     March 1998
     Salzburg, May 8-10, 1998


     A Symposium organised by the ARCH Foundation
        in collaboration with
      The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, (United States)
      The ZKM - Center for Art and Mediatechnology, (Germany)
      Illuminations, (Great Britain)
      The Universtiy of Applied Arts (Austria) and Techno-Z (Austria).

     The proposed symposium on virtual museums is aiming to define
     the dimensions of new a museum space which has no real world
     manifestation. These definitions will form the core of the ARCH
     Virtual Museum, within which all appropriate artworks dedicated
     to STATE OF THE ART project can be experienced.

     The ARCH Foundation's mission is to communicate an awareness
     initiative for the preservation of the world's cultural
     heritage through the intervention of contemporary artists.

     ARCH is trying to define how artworks created through the use of
     new media can become an important and effective communicator of
     the intrinsic value of cultural heritage. New forms of creative
     interactive dialogue and visual interpretation using ever evolving
     technology offer a provocative dimension to artistic expression.
     We hope that the challenge of multiple contexts will generate
     results that will stir the artistic community, as well as
     stimulate participation of a new audience into communities
     of interest. We want to put people in front of cultural heritage,
     and to bring the values it symbolizes to life.

     The speakers of this symposium are :

     James Boyle, Prof. of Law at American University, Washington (US)
     Peter A. Bruck, Managing Director, Techno-Z R&D (Austria)
     Graham Defries, Attorney, Bird & Bird, London (UK)
     Matthew Drutt, Associate Curator for Research,
         Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (US)
     Volker Grassmuck, Sociologist (Germany)
     John Handardt, Curator, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (US)
     Lynn Hershman Leeson,Media Artist and Professor for
        "Electronic Art" at the University of California, Davis (US)
     Tom Krens, Director, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (US)
     Michael Naimark,Artist, Interval Research Corporation, Palo Alto (US)
     Hans Peter Schwarz, Director ZKM, Media Museum (Germany)
     Jeffrey Shaw, Director, ZKM, Institute for Visual Media (Germany)
     Charles Symonyi, Chief Architect, Microsoft Cooperation (US)
     Peter Weibel,Media Artist and Curator (Austria)
     John Wyver, Chairman, Illuminations (UK)

          ...and the list is not closed yet

     A little background information :

     The ARCH Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 by
     Francesca von Habsburg and its international headquarters are
     located in Salzburg, Austria. The foundation dedicates itself to the
     preservation and restoration of cultural heritage. Its focus was to
     promote and restore cultural heritage from Central and Eastern
     European countries.  ARCH's latest project is a global awareness
     campaign which seeks to generate support for global cultural
     conservation.

     ARCH has turned to the medium of new media art, and has begun asking
     the most influential as well as emerging artists to articulate this
     mission so as to engage a young and captive audience to this cause.
     Our aim is to combine the future with our past in a compelling and
     imaginative way.

     Titled STATE OF THE ART, the project was inaugurated in Salzburg in
     the summer of 1997 to great critical acclaim. Each of the
     participating artists have dedicated works of art corresponding to
     chosen restoration sites. As a first  step, both the artworks and
     panoramic photographs of the sites themselves were then mounted onto
     larger than life size projections onto the famous Mönchsberg rock
     in the center of Salzburg. The sensational projections were
     approximately 8000m^2 in size and were projected from an impressive
     Communications Tower. The problem on how to store these "light
     sculptures" and to exhibit them in the alternative world of
     cyberspace in an innovative way was the initiating spark behind this
     symposium. Being experts in conservation rather than in new media,
     we seek to define, with the help of international experts, how the
     combination of man's greatest achievements of the past can be
     brought successfully into the future and be experienced under new
     and exciting conditions and environments.

     In concordance with the foundation's motto: "Engaging the past into
     the present is synonymous with participating in the future."

     ARCH will be inaugurating this summer in Salzburg, a Communications
     Center with its own New Media exhibition space, as well as
     "The Station", an artist-in-residence studio.

     Dear Reverend Visage - The Usual Troll Stories

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger(163/110) who, thanks
     to the miracle of nodelist transformations, no longer
     requires adult supervision to submit articles under his own
     name.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I don't think I have to tell you that the editors of Swamp
     Swine magazine were a little testy when they phoned to
     protest the latest petty cash vouchers that you submitted.
     To silence them, I passed the receipts on to Zorch, although
     I'm not sure that he'll understand that you needed to book
     400 hours of camera time on the Hubble Space Telescope in an
     attempt to find the Z1C, Bob Satti. Lisa Gronke, Fidonet
     Minister of Antiquities,  was inquiring as to your
     whereabouts and we can only hope it wasn't because she
     discovered *those* photos that were taken when we interned
     at the White House. (I think the best defense here is to go
     with total denial and claim that the huge tubs of Mazola and
     the walrus were just a science project. Can you get Vernon
     to back us up on this so we don't have to spend the rest of
     our lives as the Revlon cover-girls?)

     I know that you'd rather have root canal surgery than hear
     anything about Echopol, but you truly would admire the fact
     that no one seems to be answering my plaintive bleats about
     which problems need to be fixed that would require any more
     policy. The cognitive leap seems like a group of people
     announcing that they will have a Woolly Mastodon in their
     kitchens and then launching into debates about which colour
     to paint the beast - neatly ignoring the first question
     which ought to be why they need or desire a Mastodon in the
     first place. Bob Kohl has stomped his hindpaw and tried to
     tell a succession of sysops that they are "off topic" for
     asking important questions. Even more interesting is that
     David Hallford who has said goodbye in the last two Snoozs
     failed to note that he was leaving because of his disgust
     with Bob Kohl R10C. (Hallford was the R10EC) Even more
     interesting is that Kohl appointed our beloved Snoozlord,
     Zorch as the new R10EC.

     All the signs are pointing towards the assumption that Ward
     Dossche is our kind of guy. At least that is a fair guess
     based on the quality of his detractors. The ZCC-PUBLIC echo
     is rather infested with trophalactic wheazers so it is hard
     to decipher the significant issues. What is worth more than
     a few giggles is that Mr. Dwight is one of Ward's most
     vociferous critics. Given Mr Dwight's history as the Z2C
     elflord, I'd think that Ward is thanking his favourite deity
     that Mr. Dwight is on the opposing team. Even Zorch was
     <nudge><nudge<wink><winking> with reference to Ward in his
     editorial about "learning from history" and I don't think he
     was talking about abolition of dwarf tossing in France. If I
     wasn't so gosh darned obtuse, I'd guess that Zorch's
     reference was meant to evoke an unkind comparison to a  40's
     European politician. Mercifully, such tawdry
     characterizations are beneath Zorch so he must have been
     talking about something else.


     For this week's Chautauqua I would like to discuss
     Puritanism which is particularly germane given that one of
     the topics being discussed in the FIDOECHOPOL conference is
     whether mail transit nodes can censor by subject matter.

     The working definition of a Puritan is: one who is possessed
     by a profound fear that somewhere, somehow, someone else is
     having fun.

     Bertrand Russell said in "The Recrudescence of Puritanism"

     "My point is that pleasures which remain possible after the
     Puritan has done his utmost are more harmful than those that
     he condemns. Next to enjoying ourselves, the next greatest
     pleasure consists in preventing others from enjoying
     themselves, or, more generally, in the acquisition of power.
     Consequently those who live under the domination of
     Puritanism become exceeding desirous of power. Now love of
     power does more harm than love of drink or any of the other
     vices against which Puritans protest. Of course, in virtuous
     people love of power camouflages itself as a love of doing
     good, but this makes very little difference to its social
     effects. It merely means that we punish our victims for
     being wicked, instead of for being our enemies. In either
     case, tyranny and war result. Moral indignation is one of
     the most harmful forces in the modern world, the more so as
     it can always be diverted to sinister uses by those who
     control propaganda."

     When I first read the essay I found myself in the
     paradoxical position of being "morally indignant" at
     censorship which puts my motives into the sinister category,
     while on the other hand, agreeing with Russell that
     Puritanism as a placebo for virtue is really vice in search
     of an excuse, which puts me on the side of the angels. In
     the case of Fidoland, the paradox asserts itself in the form
     where I believe that *ECs have no right to control echomail
     content, balanced against some *EC's desire not to involve
     themselves in the propagation of mail they would find
     repugnant.

     I think the resolution of the paradox would reside in the
     ability of sysops to choose from a variety of mail sources,
     just as radio listeners can choose from several channels and
     avoid Howard Stern if they are inclined to be offended. In
     the ideal case, the recipient of the echomail makes a form
     of compact with the mail delivery sysop. If there are
     content restrictions applied by the delivering node, then
     the recipient should be able to find an alternative feed.

     In a rigidly defined echomail system with hierarchies of
     mail topographies, the opportunity for a balancing of sysop
     desires versus *EC morality has no mechanism for resolution.
     Either the sysops will assert and prevail in the opinion
     that they can make their own decisions about what is virtue
     and what is vice, or, the *ECs subjugate the desires of
     sysops and impose *their* morality.

     Naturally, I am much happier in a world where I make my own
     choices about what will offend me, and where the Puritanism
     of others is given no means to control my choices. Even if
     the Puritans prevail, I will always know that I am having
     more fun than they are and the very least I can do is let
     them know this. They will suffer horribly from this
     knowledge and hopefully take  Pyrrhic comfort from the
     aphorism that virtue is its own reward. I hope they choke on
     it.

     I must go Visage, your secretary's behaviour is getting out
     of hand. She keeps swooning about Leonardo DeCaprio whose
     appearance in the movie "Titanic" she has seen 567 times.
     I'm the only one in the universe who hasn't seen the movie
     yet. Quite frankly, if I'd wanted to watch a large, costly
     enterprise, sink slowly into the slime I'd have gone to the
     last Republican National Convention.
