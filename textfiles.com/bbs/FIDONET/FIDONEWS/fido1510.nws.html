     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     In all of my years in print and broadcast journalism, I have always
     seen the Editor position of *any* news publication or broadcaster as
     being the 'conscience' of the community...whether or not the
     community _needs_ a conscience is irrelevant, since that is the
     _duty_ of any editor of merit.

     No Editor worth his/her salt has ever been without opinions, without
     an agenda and, least of all, without controversy...otherwise, there
     would be no one to direct reporters to stories (good or bad), no
     pattern to the news made public (mix obituaries with the comics or
     local news with the classified ads), nor would there be anyone to
     stir up the controversies that are "best left unsaid" in a
     community...if for no other reason than to get people to _read_ or
     _listen_, just to see "what the hell that Editor is gonna say _next_"
     so that they can either be outraged or enlightened...depending
     always, of course, on whose ox is currently being gored.

     What I'm seeing more and more of, and from the same people as always,
     is the type of thing you see in the movies, where the reporter goes
     into the small town to uncover the 'hidden corruption'...only to be
     threatened by "The Powers That Be" to 'best be movin on, boy' when
     something is close to being uncovered.  I'm not concerned about the
     usual next step, when there is a threat made on the reporter's
     life...at least, not _yet_.

     Sound funny?  Consider this, then...

     _Prior_ to publishing my _first_ issue, at least one RC called for
     me to be removed as "unsuitable" for Editor.  One REC accused me of
     turning the FidoNews into a 'sewer of feces and lies'...

     All without one _single_ page of the FidoNews being published by me.

     Numerous messages and letters complain of an "agenda" or a "grudge"
     that I carry in this post and extend to all of the FidoNews...

     ...and yet, the only _real_ contribution I make is the Editorial and
     formatting the articles for publication.  The only changes I make to
     any submission is with the permission of the author or to insure that
     the submission complies with the ARTSPEC.DOC requirements.

     An "editorial" is a comment on a situation...AS THE EDITOR SEES IT.

     My beliefs, my views, my knowledge (or lack thereof) of matters is
     laid bare for all to see...to accept, to challenge or to ignore.

     It would seem that this is the objection being made.  One such
     detractor even indicated that I was hypocritical on the issue of
     'free speech'...for the reason that I challenged statements made,
     rather than letting them go unopposed or without comment.

     FIDONEWS 15-10               Page 2                    9 Mar 1998


     To me, that is precisely the _purpose_ of Free Speech...the ability
     to _question_ what you may see as at odds to your morality or ethics,
     let alone to challenge others on their beliefs or to the facts that
     they use, as well as what others may say one way or the other.

     If you are entitled to _your_ beliefs, why am I not entitled to
     _mine_?

     If you are able to express _your_ beliefs, why may I not express
     _mine_?

     If you are trying to gain support for _your_ beliefs, why may I not
     gather support for _mine_?

     It is in the power of each person to choose what they wish to
     believe, even if it means giving up a lifetime of cultural
     upbringing...for some it is easy, for others it is very difficult.

     But to deny each person that ability to choose for themselves what
     they believe is to deny them humanity.  They may make a 'wrong'
     choice, they may make an 'unpopular' choice...but they have the right
     to _make_ that choice for themselves.

     And so it is with an editor...if for no other reason than to provide
     a 'counter' to what is popularly held to 'be true', as well as to
     challenge those in a position of authority to prove themselves worthy
     to lead the rest of us.

     The tragic part of this is that it is those who _least_ want free and
     open discussion who bring up these issues of 'bias' or 'agenda' or
     'grudge'.  This sort of thing is in the 'real world' news all the
     time, as much as it is here in FidoNet.

     To other and more interesting news...

     Some changes are in the works for the next issue, one of which is a
     very major change.  Please make sure that your NC has a copy of the
     ARTSPEC.DOC submission guideline available, as well as the latest
     issue of the FidoNews.  I've requested an accompanying article to
     help explain it.

     As always, the latest issue can be obtained _uncensored_ from

         http://www.fidonews.org

     For reference purposes, the rules for the Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator
     election are in issue 49 of volume 14 of FidoNews (FIDO1449.NWS), and
     is dated December 8, 1997.  The _full_ text is there as part of a
     larger announcement.  You'll want to see this in order to get the
     same sort of humor one article this week has generated in some
     circles.

     And perhaps I can stop posting such damn long editorials now.

     ...ah...the miracles of a free press...

     An Editorial Correction

     As indicated in the last FidoNews Editorial, a comment was made with
     respect to the 'non-existant' area code of 867.

     In fact, the area code _does_ exist and will be fully implemented
     later this year for the Northwest Territories and the Yukon
     provinces of Canada in Zone 1.

     The Editor regrets the error and apologizes for any misunderstandings
     that it may have caused; in the future, a much more 'up-to-date' list
     of area codes will be consulted in any further such comments.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     Letter to the Editor
     by Ron Bemis, 1:124/1113

      ZF> Then there is the case of one sysop and hub operator who
      ZF> insists that unless the *full* 87K of the Zone 1 EchoMail
      ZF> Coordinator election results are not posted, some sort of
      ZF> collusion is going on.  So, to satisfy his quest for
      ZF> information and his insistence, it is now here.

     Perhaps our Fidonews editor needs to learn to "just say no".  Same
     thing goes for other peoples' echomail.  If I was interested in
     it, I'd turn on the conference.  I'd rather see original text and
     articles in Fidonews, not a bunch of quoted arguments.

      ZF> To those of you in the *OTHER* Zones, I apologize, but since
      ZF> John has decided to personally direct editorial policy in
      ZF> the FidoNews, feel free to assess his efforts in editorial
      ZF> control to John Souvestre at 1:396/1 , or at his E-Mail
      ZF> address of john@sstar.com.

     Maybe we need a Fidonews editor with less of a political agenda,
     and without grudges against so many.

      ZF> I'm having problems with some of the messages being sent to
      ZF> me...are these for _me_, or for "The FidoNews Editor"?

     Since ARTSPEC.DOC is pretty specific about what is required of a
     Fidonews article, it really shouldn't be a problem.  If the
     article contains lines longer than 70 characters, or if it does
     not start with a line beginning with "*", then it's clearly not
     meant for Fidonews.

      ZF> Also noted is that Net 163 has upped the ante on the pending
      ZF> Policy Complaint by picking up nodes in several nations and
      ZF> Zones, as well as one totally non-existant phone number for
      ZF> a node.  There doesn't seem to be an "867" area code or
      ZF> country code...anyone know of one?

     Area code 867 is in Canada - assigned to the Yukon and Northwest
     Terroritories.  You wouldn't be expected to know that unless you
     actually believed the information in the nodelist.  To assume
     something is wrong without knowledge and then complain about it
     without checking must be a sign of something, but I'm not sure
     what.

      ZF> One point coming out of the FIDONEWS echo...there seems to
      ZF> be a consensus developing over the inclusion of the "page
      ZF> breaks" in the general publication of FidoNews...are these
      ZF> being used by anyone out there?  Or is there a predominance
      ZF> to find a way to dump them?  Your comments on this are
      ZF> solicited.

     Perhaps you should ask how many people actually print it out on
     paper each week.  My guess is most people don't feel compelled to
     waste the paper.  Consider inserting a form feed or some other
     delimiter between each article - that could be useful for turning
     it into echomail messages - the only way most people will ever
     look at it.

     Oh, and while you're at it, dump the PGP key crap, or run it once
     every three months if you actually have one you're going to use.
     Then if the paranoids really want it, they can get it.  Same goes
     for the "latest software versions".  Once a month is more than
     enough.

     >from Paul Cottrell 1:163/538

     This is in responce to your comments in the last snooze. 867 is a
     valid area code and has been since last October. We have just had
     an area code change from 819. With all of the attention to our
     "special node", I am suprised that no one spotted my phone number.
     I have to wonder since I wasn't named in the complaint if Gary has
     a thing against our Maulvi. If you are wondering Nanisivik is at
     the northern tip of Baffin Island which puts me about 2700 miles
     north of Ottawa or 1000 miles from the north pole. I have had node
     1:163/538 for quite a few years and have thoroughly enjoyed the
     atmosphere of net 163 and appreciate all the help I have received
     from them over the years.

     Title:  Who Voted?
     by John Souvestre, 1:396/1

     Contrary to what a FidoNews Editor with a grudge would have you
     believe, it was the Z1EC Election Coordinator (Martin Belcke) who
     sent him the 87K file regarding the Z1EC election.  All that I asked
     be published was the information necessary to verify the votes.

     They failed to point out that the tally was not final and that there
     was a two week period to contest it.  But, there was no list of the
     nodes who voted - hence making it impossible to verify the votes.


     FIDONEWS 15-10               Page 6                    9 Mar 1998

     From the election rules:

         > The posting of the results would consist of no less than two
         > messages, one containing an alphabetic listing of keywords/
         > passwords with associated vote and the other containing a
         > numerical listing (by node number) of those who voted.  The two
         > lists would not be directly associated.

     Also:

         > ANNOUNCE TALLY  - - - - -  Feb 22
         > CONTESTING  - - - - - - -  Feb 23 - Mar  8 (2 weeks)
         > LAGTIME - - - - - - - - -  Mar  9 - Mar 11 (3 days)
         > ANNOUNCE RESULTS  - - - -  Mar 12

     The winner, just happens to be a close, personal friend of both the
     FidoNews Editor and the Election Coordinator.  You would think that
     this would encourage them to make sure that they followed the rules.

     Regards,

     John

Hi fellows,

first, thanks again for your prompt help.
I think, fidonet is a bit too strange for me.
But finally it worked. Solution: find a gateway and 
transform address to

                XXX_YYYY@z-n-f-p.gateway.zz

So long, take care and keep in touch
Klaus-Jürgen

     Norman Rockwell's Fido
     by Bill Whitehouse

          Full membership and planetary network access to anyone capable
     of observing Zone Mail Hour. Amazing, isn't it? More remarkable,
     still, is watching from a distance as such an appealing - and as yet
     unrivaled - technology unravels.
          Unbridled growth could preserve and protect fidonet from its
     uncoordinated flamers in years past. Now you're about all who remain;
     lawyer wannabes whipping your skippies all alone. Don't
     misunderstand.  Nothing wrong, you like that sort of thing.  And
     clean up after. But it ain't gonna make you no babies. Or keep the
     network from imploding.
          Fido distribution is an almost entirely for-profit business
     proposition, anymore. How much longer, you suppose, will these
     broadcast vendors underwrite such a losing proposition?
          Scrap the monarchy Policy 4 imposed in favor of a genuine peer-
     to-peer network or don't expect to see it survive another six months.
     Time does not stand still for fido.

          I tried to interview Harry Lee - fido policy's primary author -
     for a news assignment 9 years ago.
          Picture, if you will, a Norman Rockwell painting of a drug store
     soda fountain. The middle three stools are occupied by a lumbering
     fellow who after 15 years hauling cinderblock tips the scales at 300
     lbs, easy.
          That there was Harry Lee, haunting the very town Rockwell lived
     and painted. The same Rexall drug looks exactly as it did in
     Rockwell's time. So do the locals perched on the other stools.
     Outwardly, those Berkshire hill towns don't change much; the quaint
     ruin of its once thriving mill economy pickled for tour bus
     posterity. In other words, an anachronism.

     Baiting Policy Trolls

     Dear Editor,

     The following correspondence inadvertently arrived as a fax
     on my system in response to a submission by Charles Herriot
     of 1:163/110.  I feel, that as a Fidonet sysop, I would be
     remiss in my responsibility if I did not transcribe it, in
     its entirety, into the required format and forward it to the
     Snooze for your reading pleasure.

     Dear Logger,

     On behalf of Reverend Visage, I would like to thank you for
     your recent correspondence apprising us of the status of the
     Fidonet flock.

     Although Visage is currently unable to pry himself away from
     his spiritual work here at the Visage Home for Wayward
     Girls, he has asked me to respond to you on his behalf to
     acknowledge receipt of your correspondence.

     I have attempted to provide you with his commentary as best
     I can recall, although it was quite difficult taking notes
     at the Rouge with all those naked ladies shaking their
     naughties in our general direction while looking for
     salvation.  It was also difficult understanding the good
     Reverend after the fourth bottle of sacramental wine, his
     words only marginally slurred by his pelvic thrust-ridden
     sermon.


     FIDONEWS 15-10               Page 11                   9 Mar 1998



     Nonetheless, I forward you the best iteration of his
     commentary.

     "I have been following the transgressions of the lost and
      forlorn with mild amusement.  I applaud the effort of
      Sister Labonte for bringing an otherwise lost Malaysian
      sheep into the flock and commend those bretheren who find
      solace in extending the glory of communication.

       Forgive Gary, for surely he doth reveal the coyotes
       dressed as sheep among the flock.  Time, spiritual
       guidance and sheer comic relief will surely reveal the
       worship of false policy gods as the antithesis to
       communication."

     The Wurlitzer at the Ministry here in Phuket then broke into
     a bit of bump and grind, so the good Reverend Visage retired
     to the champagne room to bless a few virgins.

     Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.


     Vicar Robert (Bob) Loblaw,
     Schotchbottle Lodge,

     an ode to a meddler

     During the recent straw poll for the zec appointment by the ZC,
     we all were subject to the whinning of John Souvestree
     aka the Casun Pussy.  The last Fidonews indicated we should
     write to John John with our opinion.   As usual, the post went
     without a response.



     Date: 03 Mar 98  06:56:14
     From: Bob Moravsik on 2604/583
     To:   John Souvestre on 396/1
     Subj: Sour Grapes

     cc: Fidonews 1/23

     John John:

     All your whinning in the Z1_ELECTION echo has convinced
     most of the nodes in Fidonet that you are more for using
     Fidonet to increase your coffers then contributing to
     the hobby.  Since you tried to ram your boppy into Fidonet
     your reputation has steadily declined.  Barfaq is a farce.


     FIDONEWS 15-10               Page 12                   9 Mar 1998


     Why not work for free and open communication rather then
     trying to meddle in the affairs of every region and
     conference that suits you.  If this is impossible, throw
     the red switch and take up a hobby like knitting where
     you don't have to intereact with people.  Watch the
     needles however they are sharp.

     You've been thrown out of conferences because of your
     sillyness. Isn't it time to reassess your approach to
     these matters and try to undo years of building a
     reputation as Fidonet's "official" control freak.

     Play nice !


     Regards  Bob Moravsik, 2604/583

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Charles Herriot(163/110) who
     managed to  coax more correspondence out of Doc Logger.
     Logger was terribly busy offering media advice to several of
     the sheep that had interned in Bill Clinton's office.

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I know that you have been pre-occupied as the pharmaceutical
     advisor for the Canadian Olympic Snowboard team (party on,
     dude) but it is probably time you got the curare dart gun
     out of storage and joined me on another Big Game hunt for
     Policy Weenies. With the warm climate caused by El Nino, the
     equally moist and flatulent bleatings of policy trolls has
     rung through the FN_SYSOP echo. Who'd have thought that the
     Spam 'N Timmies *still* spend night after night, huddled
     over the nodelist looking for policy criminals.

     It seems that Net163 has fallen afoul of a sharp-eyed fellow
     who noted that Malaysia is outside the geographic boundaries
     of the net. The poor fellow, Gary Gilmore, raised himself up
     on his hind paws and filed a policy complaint. Oh, for
     pity's sake, stop snickering - this guy was serious. Not
     only was he serious but he was quickly joined by a chorus of
     like-minded policy zealots who clapped their flippers and
     agreed that offering a nodenumber to a Malaysian sysop was
     at the very least, likely to bring Civilization to an end.
     These silly gits don't seem to grasp the simple concept that
     the node was offered because Net163 prides itself on
     offering refuge to those who suffer from either the
     incompetence or malign attentions of their local NCs.

     This gets even funnier so set down your Glenlivet for a
     second. Another keener named Zorch actually got all excited
     when his Inspector Clousseau sleuthing failed to turn up the
     telephone exchange for our arctic tundra brethren. This
     completely ludicrous "discovery" was touted as more evidence
     that Net163 was geographically impaired. (If it weren't for
     the new Vegetable Libel laws in Texas, I'd suggest that
     Zorch spend a few days gaining some of Dallas Hinton's
     insights.)

     As you know, there is nothing more fun than poking sharp
     sticks at dull, enraged animals so Net163's node segment was
     soon populated by wierd and wonderful new geographic
     locales. In a predictable Pavlovian response, the humourless
     weenies got even further enraged. The netmail from Ted
     Harrison would make you blush. Some of the policymongers
     have even, gasped, threatened to netmail Bob "ZC for Life"
     Satti.


     FIDONEWS 15-10               Page 14                   9 Mar 1998


     Speaking of Bob "ZC for Life" Satti, I see that his Grey
     Emminence, Bob Kohl, squeaked through to victory as the new
     ZEC. Say, wasn't it Bob Kohl who engineering Bob "The
     Importance of Being Bob" Satti's coronation? Only 53 of the
     voters ranked Kohl as their dead last choice on the ballot
     but by the byzantine voting rules, Bob was swept to office
     on the sixth ballot.

     I must go, Visage. Your secretary hasn't been herself all
     afternoon and has been screaming at high decibels. I think
     she should get help as soon as possible because it is hard
     to imagine engendering that level of stress merely by
     playing MacLean&MacLean CDs for the last 9 hours.

             on the InterNet, either by Zone or worldwide, to post here,
             as well as other FidoNet alternatives.

             Also, any Region or Zone not represented in this list which
             has an InterNet information site active should forward the
             URL for inclusion in this list.  Networks will be listed

             based within.
