Welcome to SpiceNet!  We  appreciate your interest in  joining SpiceNet and
thank  you for looking over  our network policy and documentation. With the
help of our users, Spicenet will be an ever growing network with a friendly
atmosphere giving focus to the user first, then policy. Policy is important
in the operation of a net and once you as a sysop have instituted the net's
policy as guidelines, you're in like flint! :)

Tarragon, the owner and ZC of SpiceNet believes in the two-way street phil-
osophy of  networking. That is, please feel free to make comments and offer
suggestions to help improve SpiceNet.
