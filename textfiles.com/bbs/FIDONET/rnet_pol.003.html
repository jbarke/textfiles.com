	 INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:

	 This is the Policy and Structure of RANet, a new approach in
	 private electronic message distribution and a no-fee system
	 offered to approved affiliated nodes agreeing to abide by its
	 rules and regulations as contained in this document.

		     RANet's motto sums up its philosophy:

		  "RANet: Dedicated to the Great Masterpiece"

	 THE SPIRIT OF RANET:

	 The Spirit or Raison d'Etre of RANet is the exchange of
	 electronic messages and vibrant conferences (popularly known as
	 EchoMail) with reliability and dedication as if it were a
	 successful business rather than what it is, an amateur network.

	 The echoes on RANet are Original, Active, Plentiful - three
	 excellent reasons to join this well-administered Network.
	 Friendly hobbyists like yourself, everyone who has accepted
	 (or ever will accept) an "official" position at any level        
	 within RANet is a person recognized for carrying out his/her
	 responsibilities with professional earnestness.

	 ECHOMAIL STANDARDS WITHIN RANet:

	 RANet Echomail Policy MUST be read by each SysOp and is
	 contained in this archive as RA_ECHO.POL. Our Echomail Policy
	 differs drastically from most other networks, and you should be
	 keenly aware of it.

	 Because each SysOp decides which echoes he/she will carry on
	 their BBS, EchoMail conference creations within RANet are
	 limited only by the lack of imagination or effort put forth by
	 those who want a particular conference to exist. This Network
	 thrives on and is dedicated to echoes; potential moderators
	 without experience will receive friendly and helpful guidelines
	 by contacting the Zone Echo Coordinator (72:72/2) or their
	 NEC. Experienced moderators from conferences outside RANet
	 should also contact their RANet NEC for guidelines before
	 submitting their proposed conference to the Backbone.

	 This Network is unique in that there are definite rules and
	 guidelines established for Moderators. Please file request
	 MODRULES.ZIP from your REC or the ZEC.
         (not avaiable at this time)

	 GENERAL PROHIBITIONS FOR ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES ON RANet:

	   1.  No conference that violates FCC regulations;

	   2.  No conference that in any way advocates pirated software;

           3.  With rare exception, no conference may be moderated by a
	       non-RANet SysOp. A Moderator who is a Point off an
	       RANet Boss node is considered an RANet affiliated
	       member; the same criterion applies to a Moderator who is   
	       a User of an RANet BBS.

           4.  No conference will be accepted on the Backbone until it
	       has been active on the local RANet BBS originating it
	       and on one other BBS. This will give the ZEC a clue that
	       the conference has already established a track record. The
	       proposed local conference also must have been active on
	       the following two systems: 72:72/0 & 72:72/2 .

          5.  In order to prevent dupes between national networks and to
	      provide a more unique atmosphere in RANet, no one is
	      permitted to pass RANet echoes to a non-RANet BBS.
	      Additionally, non-RANet echoes may not be imported into
	      RANet without the expressed, netmailed permission of the
              International Zone Echomail Coordinator. 72:72/2


	 DEFINITIONS:

	   [Some of the following definitive descriptions are quoted
	    and/or adapted from ECHONET's Policy and are used with the
	    kind permission of Ed Lawyer, the current (1992) Zone
	    Coordinator of said Network. Additionally, this Policy        
	    borrows freely (and in many instances, verbatim) from the     
	    Network who parented us all: FidoNet.  FidoNet Zone           
	    Coordinator George Peace has granted us permission to quote   
            and/or adapt from FidoNet Policy4.]

		 POINTS - A point is a system which is not listed in the
	 nodelist, but is capable of FidoNet-Technology Electronic mail   
	 generation and exchange. A Point is connected to the network     
	 via one or more regular RANet nodes. Communication to or from
	 a point system into the greater network is always conducted      
	 thru one or more regular nodelisted systems.  The system         
	 operator of the *nodelisted system through which a point
	 communicates to the network at large is responsible for the      
	 proper adherence to RANet policy for his respective point
	 systems.

          * A SysOp whose node number has been published in RNETLIST.*

	 Points are often private bulletin board systems, or sometimes
	 users, who choose to accept and read message traffic 'off-line'
	 from the nodelisted system.  In terms of RANet policy, Point
	 systems are treated as users of a nodelisted system.

	 NODES - A node is a system which is capable of FidoNet-Technology
	 Electronic Mail generation and exchange, and is listed in the
	 RANet nodelists.  A node is identified by a unique address
	 within a given network, region or zone, which is assigned by the
	 appropriate network or regional coordinator specific to that node.

	 NETWORK - A network is a collection of nodes, usually within a
	 relatively local geographic area.  In terms of RANet, network
	 areas will usually be distinct geographic groupings arranged in
	 such a way as to facilitate the exchange of electronic mail, and
	 coordination information.

	 In an effort to further identify geographic location based on
	 network affiliation, RANet adopts network numbers based on the
	 local telephone areacodes within the area.  For example, areacode
	 301 is assigned as Net 301.  (Hub systems may be established within
	 a network where Long Distance charges would be incurred with mail
	 transfers.)  Added networks in a one area code state will be
	 numbered with different initial digits:  e.g., 1301, 2301, 3301,
	 etc.  In instances where _local_ calls can be placed between two or
	 more areacodes, a network can include nodes from more than one
	 areacode.  In this case, the network is numbered with the areacode
	 of the founding Network Coordinator.  Assignments are performed by
	 the International Zone Coordinator in conjunction with the Regional
         Coordinator,Zone Nodelist Coordinator and Zone Echo Coordinator when
	 appropriate.


	 REGION - A region is a collection of both networks and independent
	 nodes. Independent nodes are those nodes which do not live within
	 reasonable proximity to existing nets or cannot be included in an
	 existing network for valid technical reasons which are accepted by
	 the Zone Echo Coordinator and Technical Coordinators.

	 RANet region boundaries are original and subject to change by
	 the Zone Nodelist Coordinator when necessary.

	 ZONES - A zone is a collection of regions. In terms of RANet,
	 the entire nodelist comprises TWO Zone, until such time as
	 the Zone Coordinator in conjunction with the Zone Echo Coordinator and
	 Technical Coordinators determines it expedient to expand into
         multiple zones. RANet is known as 'Zone 72 '& 'Zone 73' (& up
	 for the future), which will allow proper zone-gating or domain-
	 gating systems of FidoNet-style mail-transfers to be utilized.


	 POSITIONS WITHIN RANet:

	     Note: Assuming you have read the "Introduction And Historical
	     Background" paragraphs above, you will understand why the
	     "Buck Stops Here" with the following three (3) hierarchical
	     RANet Administrative positions.


	 INTERNATIONAL ZONE COORDINATOR - The International Zone
	 Coordinator (ZC) is the highest administrative office within
	 RANet. He has ultimate authority over all RANet operations and,
	 since RANet is a private by-invitation-only electronic network,
	 he may approve or disapprove a new or an existing node without
	 recourse, electing to keep the reason(s) to himself. The ZC is
	 responsible for the overall operation and effectiveness of the
	 RANet Network.  As such he retains a full voting position
	 on the Executive Board and participates in decisions affecting the
         operation or direction of RANet.  The Zone Coordinator(s) is also
	 the designated point-of-contact for all inter-net liaison with
	 other FidoNet-Technology Networks.  Any policy disputes originating
         from without RANet (Zone) must be conducted thru the ZC of that
         ZONE for resolution.

         ZONE ECHO COORDINATOR - The Zone Echo Coordinator(s) (ZEC) the
	 second in authority to the Zone Coordinator  and is also the
	 technical authority regarding operations in terms of technical
	 matters within EchoNet.  He is appointed by the Zone Coordinator.
	 The ZEC is responsible for the coordination of all technical
	 matters involving RANet.  Specifically, message processing,
	 mail/message transmission and reception, and EchoMail structure
         and operation, are regulated by the Zone Echo Coordinator(s).

         The Zone Echo Coordinator is a full voting member of the Executive
	 Board.
	 
	 If the office of Zone Coordinator becomes vacant, the Zone Echo
	 Coordinator assumes the duties of ZC,in accordance with the By-Laws.


         ZONE NODELIST COORDINATOR - The Zone Nodelist Coordinator(s) (ZNC)
         is third in authority to the Zone Coordinator(s) and is also respons-
	 ible for the weekly preparation and distribution of the RANet
         nodelist(s) and updates for their Zone(s).
	 
         He is appointed by the Zone Coordinator(s). All Regional Nodelist
         up-dates are forwarded to the Nodelist Coordinator(s) on a weekly
         basis to be merged into the RANet nodelist for thier Zone
         , which the ZNC distributes (Vie Tick Files).
	  
          The Nodelist Coordinator is a full voting member of the Executive
	 Board.

         ZONE TECHNICAL COORDNATOR - The Zone Technical Coordnator(s) (ZTC)
         is the fourth in authority to the Zone Coordnator and responc-
         ible for the chairmanship of the Advisory Council of the regional
         Coordnators for his zone.
          ************************************************************
         [ This possission is Elected Office , Term Last 2 Years. Elected by
         The RC's of their Zone(s). Elections will accure on Even numbered
         Years. Campaining Till Dec 3 , and voting 7th. Take office Jan 1.]
          *************************************************************
         The Technical Coordnator is a full voting member of the Executive
         Board

         ZONE FILE COORDNATOR  - The Zone File Coordnator(s) (ZFC)
         Is the fifth in authority to the Zone Coordnator and responcible
         for the operation of the FileBone of their ZONE in RANet.
         Under the Authority if the IZC and ZC(s) of thier Zone(s)

         The Zone File Coordnator(s) are Full Voting Members of the Exective
         Board.


         EXECUTIVE BOARD - The Executive Board consists of the
         International Zone Coordinator, the Zone Echo Coordinator(s),
         Zone Nodelist Coornator(s) , Zone Technical Coordinator(s),
         ant the Zone FileNet Coordnator(s).

           The Executive Board provides the last stage of appeal in
         terms of policy administration above the Zone Coordinator,
         and sets general terms of RANet direction for the network as
         a whole.  The Executive Board establishes or modifies existing
         policy within RANet.


	 ADVISORY COUNCIL - The Advisory Council consists of each Regional
	 Coordinator, plus the Zone Coordinator as ex-officio member. One
	 of the representatives is elected by the other representatives to
	 serve as the Chair of the Council for a period of two (2) years,
	 and will be responsible for the conduct of all business.  The
	 Chair's duties include presiding over all motions or discussion
	 within the Council.  If a policy violation or other unresolved
	 problem is brought to the attention of a Regional Coordinator from
	 up the normal chain (Net Coordinator), and he/she is unable to
	 resolve it equitably, it must be brought before the Advisory
	 Council.  If the Council's recommendations go unheeded by the
	 offending party(-ies), the Chair must make the issue known to the
	 Executive Board.


         REGIONAL COORDINATOR - The Regional Coordinator(s) maintains the list
	 of networks, and any independent nodes within his/her respective
	 region.  They perform an administrative function of resolving any
	 policy disputes brought to them in appeal from Network Coordinators,
	 or against any Network Coordinators themselves. The Regional
	 Coordinator must follow the established schedule for receiving node-
	 list segment updates from the network coordinators within their
	 region, and is responsible for the consolidation of these lists into
	 the regional nodelist segment, and submission to the Nodelist
	 Coordinator for inclusion into the weekly RANet nodelist.
	 Together with the latest edition of RANews, the Regional
	 Coordinator also receives the complete RANet weekly nodelists/
	 nodediffs and arranges for their distribution to the Network Co-
	 ordinators in a timely manner. A Regional Coordinator  does not
	 perform message-forwarding services for any nodes in the region.

	 THE REGIONAL ECHO COORDINATOR (REC)

	 A Regional Echo Coordinator is responsible to the Zone Echo
	 Coordinator for all that happens in the region with regard to the
	 transfer and content of Echomail.  The REC should be able to supply
	 all RANet conferences available on the Backbone to their  NECs.
	 The Zone Echo Coordinator holds the Regional Echo Coordinator
	 completely responsible for the smooth operation of EchoMail within
	 the region.  Likewise, the REC holds the Net Coordinator completely
	 responsible for the smooth  operation of the network. It is the duty    
	 of the REC to assure that there is absolutely NO porting of RANet
	 echomail to non-RANet systems; conversely, the REC must also be
	 certain that no non-RANet echomail is brought into RANet. The REC
	 must notify the ZEC if a problem remains unresolved, with carbon        
	 copies to all concerned.

         The Backbone will deliver echomail conferences to the REC(s); unless
	 other arrangements can be mutually agreed upon, it is the               
	 responsibility of each REC to deliver RANet conferences to his/her
	 NECs or independent nodes.

	 THE NETWORK ECHO COORDINATOR (NEC)

         A Network Echo Coordinator(s) is responsible to the Regional Echo
	 Coordinator for all that happens in his/her net with regard to the
	 transfer and content of Echomail.  The NEC should be able to            
	 supply all RANet conferences on the Backbone to their nodes
         requesting them. The ZEC holds the REC(s) completely responsible for
	 the smooth operation of EchoMail within the region. Likewise, the
	 REC holds the Net Coordinator completely responsible for the            
	 smooth operation of the network. It is the duty of the NEC to           
	 assure that there is absolutely NO porting of RANet echomail to
         non-RANet systems; conversely, the NEC(s) must also be certain that
	 no non-RANet echomail is brought into RANet. The NEC must
	 notify the offending node immediately. A node that refuses to end
	 this practice after one warning shall be excommunicated from            
	 RANet. The NEC must notify the REC if a problem remains               
	 unresolved, with carbon copies to all concerned.


         NETWORK COORDINATOR - The Network Coordinator(s), who is held
         responsible by the Regional Coordinator(s) for the smooth operation
	 of all in his net, maintains the list of nodes within his
	 respective geographic area, which comprises his network.  He            
	 performs an administrative function of maintaining his network's
	 smooth operation, and resolves any local policy disputes.


         The Network Coordinator(s) administer any local coordination
	 required to allow new nodes to join RANet, and for any
	 activities resulting in changes, additions or subtractions from
	 the nodelist segment within his respective network.  He/she should
	 use network mail to inform a new SysOp of the node number, as this
	 helps to insure that the system is capable of receiving network
	 mail.

         The Network Coordinator(s) is charged with coordinating the receipt
	 and forwarding of host-routed inbound netmail for nodes in his/her
	 net, implementing this in a fashion left to his/her discretion; to
	 make available to nodes in the network new nodelist difference          
	 files, new issues of RANews, and new revisions of Network Policy
	 documents as they are received; and to periodically check to            
	 insure that nodes use up to date nodelists.

	 If a node in his/her network is acting in a sufficiently annoying
	 manner, then the NC can take whatever action is deemed fitting,
         according to the circumstances of the case with in Policy.

	 MAINTAINING THE NODELIST

         The NC(s) should implement name changes, phone number changes, so
	 forth in their segment of the nodelist as soon as possible after
         the information is received from the affected node.  The NC(s)
	 should also on occasion send a message to every node in their
	 network to ensure that they are operational. If a node turns out
	 to be "offline" with no prior warning, mark the node down or
	 remove it from the nodelist.  (Nodes are to be marked DOWN for
         a maximum of 4 weeks, after which the line should be removed
	 from the nodelist.)

         At the NC(s) discretion, a portion of this workload may be assigned
	 to routing hubs.  In this case, the NC should receive the               
	 nodelist segments from the Hub Coordinators within his/her
	 network.  The NC will need to maintain a set of nodelists for each
	 hub within his/her network, since it is unwise to count on getting
         an update from each Hub Coordinator as changes are made.

         The NC must assemble a master update for his/her network  and send
         it to the Regional Coordinator by the day and time designated
         ***(Tuesday 11PM)***. The RC must assemble the master Update list
	 for his/her region and submit it to the Zone Node Coordinator by the
         day and time designated *** (Wedensday 11PM)***.

	 MAKING AVAILABLE POLICIES, NODELISTS AND RANews

         Each NC should obtain a new issue of  RNETLIST/RNETDIFF  files
         every week from the Regional Coordinator.  The nodelist difference
         file is currently made available each Friday morning from the
         ZNC at 12am for the Regional Coordinator(s), and the RANews will be
         sent along with the nodediff periodically.  The NC(s) must
	 make these files available to all nodes in the network. Or send them
	 directly via the TICK method. Most RC's, NC's and Hub's should have
	 the TICK method of distributing files 24-7.

	 The NC is also encouraged to write an informal what's-going-on,
	 what's-new-in-the-net newsletter to be distributed to his/her
	 nodes periodically.

	 Each NC should also obtain the most recent versions of the Policy
	 documents that bind the members of his/her network, and make those
	 available to the nodes in their network.  Policies are released at
	 sporadic intervals, so please inform the nodes in your network          
	 when such events occur, and ensure the nodes are generally
	 familiar with the changes.

         Policy, RANews, and the RNETLIST are the glue that holds us
	 together.  Without them, we would cease to be a community, and
	 become just another random collection of bulletin boards.

	 ENCOURAGE NEW SYSOPS TO ENTER RANet

	 A coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
	 system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
         Policy, RANews, and RNETLIST  to potential new sysops.
	 Dissemination of this information to persons who are potential
	 RANet sysops is important to the growth of RANet, and
	 coordinators should encourage development of new systems.


	 SYSTEM OPERATOR - Also known as 'SysOp' or Node Operator.  The
	 SysOp or node operator within RANet who operates a network node,
	 or independent node within a region.  All SysOps who wish to            
	 become members of RANet must agree to abide by this policy
         document as well as policy dictates by the IZC or Executive Board,
	 and to exist in harmony with other RANet members.

	 JOINING RANet:

	 While it is a private network, RANet is open to any SysOp who
         agrees to follow the RANet Policy.
         If you are a FidoNet (or other network) node, We Have our own
         Node Numbering method.
         (Echomail & File Transfers are sent via your RANet node number
         Only.)

	 In order to become an RANet member, the SysOp must first obtain
         an RANet SysOp Kit (available under the Magic name of "RANET" by
         file request from 1:3804/2 or 72:72/1), (2:251/22 or 73:73/1)
         Read and acknowledge agreement with the policy, and forward
         a membership application to the Network Regional Coordinator
         closest to you  or the Zone Coordinator.  Upon the receipt and
	 approval of a membership application, the new node will be added
	 to the weekly nodelist update submissions.

	 Once a member has been listed in the weekly nodelist, he becomes a
	 member of RANet, and is subject to RANet policy. While it is
	 not required that policy complaints from outside of RANet be
	 accepted, it is the nature of RANet that reasonable policy
	 complaints from outside the network will be addressed by the
	 International Zone Coordinator.

	 HOW TO OBTAIN A NODE NUMBER

	 You must first obtain a current nodelist so that you can send
	 mail. You do not need a node number to send mail, but you must
	 have one in order for others to send mail to you.  If not
	 available locally, the current RANet nodelist may be file
         requested from 72:72/0 (1:3804/2) 73:73/0 (2:251/22)
         with the magic name "RANET".

	 Once you have a nodelist, you must determine which network or
         region covers your area.  Regions are numbered 101 ,102 ECT;(USA)
         or 73?? (EUR)  by state or Country this time. network numbers
         are by the local areacode.
	 Networks are more restricted in area than regions, but are
	 preferred since they improve the flow of mail and provide more
	 services to their members.  If you cannot find a network which
	 covers your area, then pick the region which does.

	 Once you have located the network or region in your area, send a
         message containing a request for a node number to node zero
         ( 72:????/0 ) of that network or region.  The request must be
         sent by netmail, as this indicates that your system has RANet
         capability.

         You should poll his system for a reply after a cupple days.
         This should give time to read and reply with your Node Number.

	 + You must set up your software so that the from-address in your
	   message to the NC (or RC) does not cause problems for the
	   coordinator.  If you are currently a member of another network,
	   such as FidoNet, you can send your application to the NC using
	   your Fido address.  If you are not with another network, set
	   your mailer to use address 72:nnnn/9999, where nnnn is the Net
	   or Region you're applying to.  This is only temporary until your
	   NC or RC assigns a node number to you.


	 Your coordinator may contact you for additional information.

	 Please allow at least two weeks for a node number request to be
         processed into the Nodelist. This should not keep you from
         connection to the Echomail areas once you have you net number.
          If you send your request to a Regional Coordinator, it
	 may forwarded to the appropriate Network Coordinator.

	 Once your application has been approved, and your node number has
         been published in RNETLIST.A* , please link into RA_NET. This echo
	 is mandatory for and restricted to all RANet SysOps.

	 Your link to echomail will normally be your Network Echomail
	 Coordinator. (Or an RANet system who serves as a Hub for your
	 area.) If you are an independent node, then your RC will be happy
	 to help you arrange for your echomail conferences. As a last resort,
	 you may arrange to poll the Backbone (72:72/2 or 72:72/3 ).

          Your weekly RANODE/DIFF and all administration files will be
          available from your NC or RC.

	 SysOp Procedures

	 As the SysOp of an individual node, you can generally do as you
	 please, as long as you observe mail events, are not excessively
	 annoying to other nodes in RANet, and do not promote or
	 participate in the distribution of pirated copyrighted software or
	 other illegal behavior via RANet.

	 In order to prevent dupes between national networks and to provide
	 a more unique atmosphere in RANet, no one is permitted to pass
	 RANet echoes to a non-RANet BBS.  Additionally, non-RANet
	 echoes may not be imported into RANet without the expressed,
	 netmailed permission of the Zone Echomail Coordinator.

         ****************************************************************

         FAMILIAROTY WITH POLICY

	 In order to understand the meaning of "excessively annoying", it
	 is incumbent upon all sysops to occasionally re-read RANet
	 policy. New sysops should familiarize themselves with policy
	 before requesting a node number.

	 Responsible for All Traffic Entering RANet Via the Node

	 The SysOp listed in the nodelist entry is responsible for all
	 traffic entering RANet via that system.  This includes (but is
	 not limited to) traffic entered by SysOp, users, and points. No
	 SysOp shall allow "outside" messages to enter RANet via his/her
	 system.

	 ENCRYPTION AND REVIEW OF MAIL

	 Like FidoNet, RANet is an amateur system.  Our technology is
	 such that the privacy of messages cannot be guaranteed.  As a
	 SysOp, you have the right to review traffic flowing through your
	 system, if for no other reason than to ensure that the system is
	 not being used for illegal or commercial purposes.  Encryption
	 obviously makes this review impossible.  Therefore, encrypted
	 and/or commercial traffic that is routed without the express
	 permission of all the links in the delivery system constitutes
	 annoying behavior.

	 NO ALTERATION OF ROUTED MAIL

	 You may not modify, other than as required for routing or other
	 technical purposes, any message, netmail or echomail, passing
	 through the system from one RANet node to another.  If you are
	 offended by the content of a message, the procedure described in
	 "Not Routing Mail" must be used.

	 PRIVATE NETMAIL

	 The word "private" should be used with great care, especially with
	 users of a BBS.  Some countries have laws which deal with "private
	 mail", and it should be made clear that the word "private" does
	 not imply that no person other than the recipient can read
	 messages. Sysops who cannot provide this distinction should
	 consider not offering users the option of "private mail".

	 If a user sends a "private message," the user has no control over
	 the number of intermediate systems through which that message is
	 routed.  A SysOp who sends a message to another SysOp can control
	 this aspect by sending the message direct to the recipient's
	 system, thus guaranteeing that only the recipient or another
	 individual to whom that SysOp has given authorization can read the
	 message.  Thus, a SysOp may have different expectations than a
	 casual user.

	 NO DISCLOSURE OF IN-TRANSIT MAIL

	 Disclosing or in any way using information contained in private
	 netmail traffic not addressed to you or written by you is
	 considered annoying behavior, unless the traffic has been released
	 by the author or the recipient as a part of a formal policy             
	 complaint.  This does not apply to echomail which is by definition
	 a broadcast medium, and where private mail is often used to keep a
	 SysOp-only area restricted.

	 RESTRICTED CONFERENCES

	 There are several conferences that are restricted to certain
	 positions within RANet. For example, RA_NET is an echo for
	 RANet SysOps only. It may not be read or seen by _anyone_ who is
	 not an RANet SysOp of record - meaning, if he/she is not on the
	 nodelist, access to this area is to be denied him or her. When an
	 Approved Moderator restricts an echo, those restrictions are to be
	 strictly observed by all who are sanctioned to carry that               
	 conference.  Other restricted conferences may be added, please 
         observe the Roster of Echo Areas (ECHO????.TXT) for the status of
         the conferences in RANet (USA)        [???=MMYY]
         Magic Name: Echolist

	 PRIVATE MAIL ADDRESSED TO YOU

	 The issue of private mail which is addressed to you is more
	 difficult than the in-transit question treated previously.  A
	 common legal opinion holds that when you receive a message it
	 becomes your property and you have a legal right to do with it
	 what you wish.  Your legal right does not excuse you from annoying
	 others.

	 In general, sensitive material should not be sent using RANet.
	 This ideal is often compromised, as RANet is our primary mode of
	 communication.  In general, if the sender of a message                  
	 specifically requests in the text of the message that the contents
	 be kept confidential, release of the message into a public forum
	 may be considered annoying.

	 There are exceptions.  If someone is saying one thing in public
	 and saying the opposite in private mail, the recipient of the
	 private mail should not be subjected to harassment simply because
	 the sender requests that the message not be released.  Judgment
	 and common sense should be used in this area as in all other
	 aspects of RANet behavior.

	 NOT ROUTING MAIL

	 You are not required to route traffic if you have not agreed to do
	 so.  You are not obligated to route traffic for all if you route
	 it for any, unless you hold a Network Coordinator or Hub                
	 Coordinator position.  Routing traffic through a node not               
	 obligated to perform routing without the permission of that node
	 may be annoying behavior.  This includes unsolicited echomail.

	 If you do not forward a message when you previously agreed to
	 perform such routing, the message must be returned to the SysOp of
	 the node at which it entered RANet with an explanation of why it
	 was not forwarded.  (It is not necessary to return messages which
	 are addressed to a node which is not in the current nodelist.)
	 Intentionally stopping an in-transit message without following
	 this procedure constitutes annoying behavior.  In the case of a
	 failure to forward traffic due to a technical problem, it does not
	 become annoying unless it persists after being pointed out to the
	 SysOp.

	 IF YOU ARE GOING OFFLINE

	 If your node will be offline for longer than two days, inform your
	 coordinator as soon as possible.

	 Never put an answering machine or any other device which answers
	 the phone on your phone line while you are down.  If you do,            
	 calling systems will get the machine repeatedly, racking up large
	 phone bills, which is very annoying.  In short, the only thing
	 which should ever answer the telephone during periods when the
	 nodelist indicates that your node will accept mail is FidoNet-
	 compatible software which accepts mail.

	 If you will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
	 period of time (such as while you are on vacation), you should
	 notify your coordinator.  Systems have a tendency to "crash" now
	 and then, so you will probably want your coordinator to know that
	 it is a temporary condition if it happens while you are away.


	 USERS - Users are the class of individuals who do not have the
	 primary responsibility for the management of a network or region
	 node within RANet.  They may be point operators, or dial-in
	 users of bulletin boards within RANet.  Any and all actions
	 taken by users are the responsibility of the System Operators of
	 the system which the Users are accessing.  Policy complaints are
	 not generally addressed to users, as they are not bound by RANet
	 policy, however the system operator is responsible, and all             
	 complaints about users will be addressed to the operators of the
	 system or systems through which the user has gained access to
	 RANet.


	 ZONE MAIL HOUR

	 Zone Mail Hour (ZMH) is a defined time during which all nodes are
	 required to be able to accept netmail.  Zone Mail Hour in RANet
	 corresponds to that in FidoNet:

			 0400-0500 EST  (0500-0600 EDT)
			 0300-0400 CST  (0400-0500 CDT)
			 0200-0300 MST  (0300-0400 MDT)
			 0100-0200 PST  (0200-0300 PDT)

	 During ZMH, there should be no BBS callers allowed on your system.
	 This greatly facilitates the transfer of Net and EchoMail.


	 NODELIST

	 The nodelist is a file updated weekly which contains the addresses
	 of all recognized RANet nodes.  This current nodelist is
	 delivered by the ZC to the RCs for distribution to their
	 respective NCs by Friday morning. The current nodelist is always
	 available for file request from any member of the Executive Board,
	 by using the magic name RANODE or RADIFF.

	 To be included in the nodelist, a system must meet the requirements     
	 defined by this document.  No other requirements may be imposed.

	 The full list as published by the International Zone Coordinator is     
	 regarded as the official RANet nodelist, and is used in
	 circumstances such as determination of eligibility for voting.

	 POLICY GUIDELINES:

	      Two precepts copied from FidoNet and EchoNet applyed in RANet:

	      1. Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

	      2. Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

	 In addition to these simple policy dictates above, the Executive
	 Board constantly evaluates and amends this RANet Policy document
	 when necessary.


	 FidoNet's Expression of Excessively Annoying Behavior
	   Applies to RANet

	 There are references throughout this policy to "excessively
	 annoying behavior."  It is difficult to define this term, as it is
	 based upon the judgment of the coordinator structure. Generally
	 speaking, annoying behavior irritates, bothers, or causes harm to
	 some other person.  It is not necessary to break a law to be annoying.

	 There is a distinction between excessively annoying behavior and
	 (simply) annoying behavior.  For example, there is a learning curve     
	 that each new SysOp must climb, both in the technical issues of how to 
	 set up the software and the social issues of how to interact with       
	 RANet.  It is a rare SysOp who, at some point in this journey, does
	 not manage to annoy others.  Only when such behavior persists, after  
	 being pointed out to the SysOp, does it become excessively annoying. 
	 This does not imply that it is not possible to be excessively annoying 
	 without repetition (for example, deliberate falsification of mail  
	 would likely be excessively annoying on the very first try), but        
	 simply illustrates that a certain amount of tolerance is extended.


	 ELECTIVE POLICIES:

         International Zone Coordinator Tim Settle shall remain in office until
	 he vacates it, at which time ZEC Tim Settle automatically becomes
	 International Zone Coordinator, and remains in that position until he 
         vacates the office, at which time ZNC automatically becomes
	 International Zone Coordinator, and remains in that position until he 
	 vacates the office, at which time the Regional Coordinators (the 
	 Advisory Council) will elect the new IZC from within their ranks. The 
	 Chair for the discussion and election shall be an RC who definitely  
	 does not want to assume the duties of IZC. (Allow no more than two 
	 weeks of debates on who shall become the Chair.) The Chair shall 
	 decide how long the IZC pre-election campaign will last.


         The Zone Echo Coordinator and Zone Nodelist Coordinator
	 shall remain in their respective offices until replacements are
	 appointed by the Zone Coordinator.

	 The term of office for all other administrative positions within
	 RANet below the Executive Board is for two (2) years.

	 COORDINATOR RECALL OR REPLACEMENT POLICIES:

	 In the rare event where there is disillusion or disharmony within
	 RANet, there are procedures for the removal and replacement of
	 the administration-chain.

	 In the event that disharmony has occurred thru the violation of
	 policy by any coordinator position, the coordinator directly above
	 and in the chain-of-command may dictate the removal of the 
	 offending coordinator.  This is subject to appeal by the
	 individual removed from office to the next-higher office in the
	 chain of command, but should the appeal not be made, or the
	 appeal denied by the appropriate authority, a replacement election      
	 will be held for the position vacated.

	 A second method for the removal of Coordinator positions within
	 RANet is a petition for recall vote.  At the Network level, ten
	 percent (10%) of the total number of SysOps in the net, or five
	 SysOps, whichever is less, may file a petition with the Regional
	 Coordinator for removal of the Network Coordinator in question.

	 The Regional Coordinator has the option to accept or deny the
	 petition for recall.  If accepted, he will direct an election be
	 held establishing a vote-of-confidence of the Network Coordinator
	 in question.  In terms of simple majority of votes cast, if the
	 popular vote decrees that the coordinator be replaced, a                
	 replacement election will be held.  If a simple majority of those
	 voting in the recall election do not wish the coordinator's             
	 removal, he will continue in the duties of his office, and not be
	 subject to another recall petition for at least six (6) months 
	 after the unsuccessful recall election.


	 In the election held subsequent to a successful recall election, a
	 replaced Coordinator may run for his 'former' office unless
	 removed from RANet by action of the Coordinator structure. The
	 successful candidate in this election will serve the remainder of
	 the original term of office of the removed Coordinator.


	 At the Region level, twenty percent (20%) of the total number of
	 SysOps in the Region, or twenty (20) SysOps, whichever is less,
	 may file a petition with the Zone Coordinator for removal of the
	 Regional Coordinator in question.  Otherwise, the procedure for
	 recall of Regional Coordinator is conducted in the same manner as
	 that of a Network Coordinator, and the Zone Coordinator's role in
	 this procedure is exactly the same as that of the Regional
	 Coordinator in Network Coordinator recalls.


	 Resignations by any position below the level of the Executive
	 Board will result in an immediate appointment by the next-higher
	 authority  (if required for proper network operations) of a
	 temporary replacement, and a replacement election, as soon as
	 technically feasible, to fill the position so vacated.  Voting
	 procedures will be determined by the Coordinator responsible for
	 the election, and will follow RANet policy as described by the
	 procedure then in effects.  In cases where necessary, the
	 Coordinator conducting the election may appoint a neutral SysOp
	 within the election area to collect and pass forward for counting
	 and review - the ballots for the vacant office. (To alleviate the
	 costs of each individual forwarding their ballots long-distance).

	 APPEAL PROCESS

	 A decision made by a coordinator may be appealed to the next
	 level. Appeals must be made within two weeks of the decision which
	 is being  appealed.  All appeals must follow the chain of command;
	 if levels are skipped the appeal will be dismissed out of hand.

	 An appeal will not result in a full investigation, but will be
	 based upon the documentation supplied by the parties at the lower
	 level. For example, an appeal of a Network Coordinator's decision
	 will be decided by the Regional Coordinator based upon information
	 provided by the coordinator and the SysOp involved; the Regional
	 Coordinator is not expected to make an independent attempt to
	 gather information.

	 The appeal structure is as follows:

	 Network Coordinator decisions may be appealed to the appropriate
	 Regional Coordinator.

	 Regional Coordinator decisions may be appealed to the Zone
	 Coordinator.  At this point, the Zone Coordinator will make a
	 decision and communicate it to the Regional Coordinators in that
	 zone.

	 Zone Coordinator decisions may be appealed to the Executive Board.

	 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

	 A complaint may not be filed more than 60 days after the date of
	 discovery of the source of the infraction, either by admission or
	 technical evidence.  Complaints may not be filed more than 120
	 days after the incident unless they involve explicitly illegal
	 behavior.

	 RIGHT TO A SPEEDY DECISION

	 A coordinator is required to render a final decision and notify
	 the parties involved within 30 days of the receipt of the
	 complaint or appeal.

	 If a person at any level above SysOp is unable to properly perform
	 their duties, the person at the next level may replace them. For
	 example, if a Regional Coordinator fails to perform, the Zone
	 Coordinator can replace him.


	 RANEWS NEWSLETTER:

	 RANet offers a free 'electronic newsletter' called RANews(c),
	 which is provided as a central communications medium and
	 information exchange vehicle for our members.  We are all
	 encouraged to make submissions and to make it available for
	 reading by our members.  The current Editor's name and node number
	 is listed at the top of the RANet nodelist. Each NC should
	 obtain a new issue of RANews from the Regional Coordinator,
	 along with the last nodediff of the Week. The NC must make these
	 files available to all nodes in the network.
