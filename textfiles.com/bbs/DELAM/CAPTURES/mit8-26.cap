* Anyone wishing to help me debug `uw' should drop me a note.  [19JUL92]

* The `nn' daemon has been (at least) temporarily turned off.  [31JUL92]

* `csh' currently has the annoying feature of not sending hangup signals
  to its children when you disconnect.  This leaves lots of looping
  processes around.  Unless someone voices a reasonable objection, I may
  alias `csh' to `tcsh' until this is fixed.  Some users may actually
  appreciate this.  B-)  [19AUG92]

* I replaced the old `automount' with `amd'.  Hopefully it will be more
  reliable.  The mount paths are at least readable now.  [24AUG92]

NICE(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual              NICE(1)

NAME
     nice, nohup - run a command at low priority (sh only)

SYNOPSIS
     nice [ -number ] command [ arguments ]

     nohup command [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
     Nice executes command with low scheduling priority.  If the
     number argument is present, the priority is incremented
     (higher numbers mean lower priorities) by that amount up to
     a limit of 20.  The default number is 10.

     The super-user may run commands with priority higher than
     normal by using a negative priority, e.g. `--10'.

     Nohup executes command immune to hangup and terminate sig-
     nals from the controlling terminal.  The priority is incre-
     mented by 5.  Nohup should be invoked from the shell with
     `&' in order to prevent it from responding to interrupts by
     or stealing the input from the next person who logs in on
     the same terminal.

FILES
     nohup.out standard output and standard error file under
     nohup

SEE ALSO
     csh(1), setpriority(2), renice(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Nice returns the exit status of the subject command.

BUGS
     Nice and nohup are particular to sh(1).  If you use csh(1),
     then commands executed with ``&'' are automatically immune
     to hangup signals while in the background.  There is a buil-
     tin command nohup which provides immunity from terminate,
     but it does not redirect output to nohup.out.

     Nice is built into csh(1) with a slightly different syntax
     than described here.  The form ``nice +10'' nices to posi-
     tive nice, and ``nice -10'' can be used by the super-user to
     give a process more of the processor.

Out of the country?   Where will you be going?  Sounds like a great
job for a game enthusiast!

Because the magazines will be going printed matter rate, they have
to be in openable packaging. I found some clear zip pockets which hold
about 10 magazines each.  I'll get in touch later about payment.  Since
we're coming over in Jan for my brother's wedding, we may be able to
arrange my picking up money there.  Otherwise, I have found someone
who you could send the cheque to who will give me the sterling
equivalent without charging commission.

Thanks for the new address and I hope the disks arrive okay.  You
can write to me until mid Oct at

  15 Dudley Road
  Kingston upon Thames
  Surrey
  KT1 2UN

I'll let you know my new address when I move.  A friend owns the
apartment and so she'll forward anything that slips through.

Regards.

I wasn't at home all today and thought I would catch you in IRC.  
I logged on while your name was in the channel but it must have been a
ghost connection.  Anyways, my situation [for the next few months, anyway]
is that I've got classes Tues/Thurs.  Commuting to the bay area
wouldn't be too difficult [and perhaps more economical than relocating,
I imagine].  I talked with my parents about it and they are quite for it.
Let me know what you think.

Sorry I haven't mailed earlier, but there have been hardware
upgrades here for two weeks and then mail has been screwy 
until today.  Things have happened very quickly, but I'm very
pleased to say that I have found a contract job in the City
and will be leaving here next week (27th August).  Unfortunately,
I shall lose my e-mailability but if Frank buys me my promised
modem, who knows, I'll be able to terrorise mailboxes once again.

We're also having to move out of our flat mid October, and since we
haven't found a new place I can't tell you what our new address
will be.  If you want to keep in touch by post, let me know and
I'll tell you my parents' address and our new address when we move.

I've posted you the Amiga cover disks which should get to you in
a couple of weeks.  I've found a cheaper way of sending the magazines,
by < 5Kg packages under printed matter rate.  This way will take
3 months to arrive by sea, though.  This would cost about fifty pounds.
Or would you prefer everything in 3 weeks (at least) for fifteen
pounds more?  The slow route is easier for me as it means I can pack
them simply.

Sorry to bother you, but what do you mean with a stock ST? I have one

Not just a changing sync - a constant sync - this register actually sets the 
sync for the port :-)  Not very nice, and I have had a few demo's when this
has happened, luckily it has changed to a sync within the monitors range and i
just get a garbled picture.

I know - unfortunately i know peopel who have written viruses before they
grew up (And on the PC thank god ;-) that for instance sat on the serial
device (Com? in this case) and every now and then added characters just for fun
The virus was called line noise or something and I don'y know if he ever 
released it.  Unfortunately for the programmer, if he undertook your idea, would run ito some problems.  For instance, all that 911 does here is return a not
connected message, and the same in the UK (We are 000, they are 999) but for a 
virus solely for the US (which would be a bit silly taking into account the 
low numbers of Amiga's there) would be good (Well very nasty).

Yeah - if only The Silents had done as god a job with the end product as the

Me - I don't code.  I keep up on the hardware because It's impossible to have
conversations with our coders without having knowledge of it.  Its also nice to
know that my 3000 is capable of generating almost any sync it likes from its
RGB port.  Imagine the monitors you could use if you just wrote a WB driver
for them :-)

So was mine - untill I bought the Phoenix board - the 2MB chip version is going
for $950 AUS I think at the moment and that is fully optioned.  I put a deposit on one when they were first anounced as an idea.  And for the year and a half
that i had the board I was very happy with it.  I sold it because it was cheaper to sll it and buy a 3K than to buy an accelorator and Ram for it...

Not a problem.  Hopefull the RPG type one will have the appraisal version 
consisting of the first world will be out in a month or two.  The other 3 
worlds will be available when the sharware contribution is paid.

New BEAMCON0 Register

descrip[tions of the register bits.  And thena few warnings.  Like writing to
this register directly has the (remote) possibility of destroying your 
multisync monitor.  

This possibility is not that remote.  If a multisync monitor is sync'd to high
then there is a big chance that you will blow some expensive monitor hardware.

If someone really had it in for 3000 owners, they could right a nice proggie to do this, as well as attacking the nvram used in the scsi controller...
> 
Also - pinball dreams did a fri job with the drive :-)

As for following the guidlines - One coder I know, wouldn't know what they were
Fortunately, all our stuff is tested under 1.3 and 2.0, on 500's, 1000's (well 
some features that use new featurs of the ECS won't work in the old ones) 2000's and my 3000.  And one of the 500's is running an '030 as well, and we follow
guidlines.  

BTW - Buy a phoenix board for you 1000 - when i had mine, best investment I evermade before the 3000

Also - if you liek I'll put you on the mailing list for Alchemy PRoductions, 
We are working on 3 games at the moment, 1 a ultima/bards tale/phatasie/EOB
type game, and 2 others on orignal ideas.

Typical of the 'Worthless Idiots" that right 68000 specific code.  MAny a great demo written before the release of the 3000 and cheaper '030 accelorators work
fine on these machines.  It's like directly accessing what used to be unused 
registers on the custom chips.  It's possible that these calls could do
damage to a system.  And as for it running fine on your system.  That's great
It works on a system that Commodore dropped about 2 years ago :-)

MAIL(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual              MAIL(1)

NAME
     mail - send and receive mail

SYNOPSIS
     mail [ -v ] [ -i ] [ -n ] [ -s subject ] [ user ...  ]
     mail [ -v ] [ -i ] [ -n ] -f [ name ]
     mail [ -v ] [ -i ] [ -n ] -u user

INTRODUCTION
     Mail is a intelligent mail processing system, which has a
     command syntax reminiscent of ed with lines replaced by mes-
     sages.

     The -v flag puts mail into verbose mode; the details of
     delivery are displayed on the users terminal.  The -i flag
     causes tty interrupt signals to be ignored. This is particu-
     larly useful when using mail on noisy phone lines.  The -n
     flag inhibits the reading of /usr/lib/Mail.rc.

     Sending mail.  To send a message to one or more people, mail
     can be invoked with arguments which are the names of people
     to whom the mail will be sent.  You are then expected to
     type in your message, followed by an EOT (control-D) at the
     beginning of a line.  A subject may be specified on the com-
     mand line by using the -s flag. (Only the first argument
     after the -s flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote
     subjects containing spaces.) The section below, labeled
     Replying to or originating mail, describes some features of
     mail available to help you compose your letter.

     Reading mail.  In normal usage mail is given no arguments
     and checks your mail out of the post office, then prints out
     a one line header of each message there.  The current mes-
     sage is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can be
     printed using the print command (which can be abbreviated
     p).  You can move among the messages much as you move
     between lines in ed, with the commands `+' and `-' moving
     backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.

     Disposing of mail.  After examining a message you can delete
     (d) the message or reply (r) to it.  Deletion causes the
     mail program to forget about the message.  This is not
     irreversible; the message can be undeleted (u) by giving its
     number, or the mail session can be aborted by giving the
     exit (x) command.  Deleted messages will, however, usually
     disappear never to be seen again.

     Specifying messages.  Commands such as print and delete can
     be given a list of message numbers as arguments to apply to
     a number of messages at once.  Thus ``delete 1 2'' deletes
     messages 1 and 2, while ``delete 1-5'' deletes messages 1
     through 5.  The special name ``*'' addresses all messages,

Printed 8/26/92            May 9, 1986                          1

MAIL(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual              MAIL(1)

     and ``$'' addresses the last message; thus the command top
     which prints the first few lines of a message could be used
     in ``top *'' to print the first few lines of all messages.

     Replying to or originating mail.  You can use the reply com-
     mand to set up a response to a message, sending it back to
     the person who it was from.  Text you then type in, up to an
     end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.  While you
     are composing a message, mail treats lines beginning with
     the character `~' specially.  For instance, typing ``~m''
     (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message
     into the response right shifting it by a tabstop.  Other
     escapes will set up subject fields, add and delete reci-
     pients to the message and allow you to escape to an editor
     to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.
     (These options are given in the summary below.)

     Ending a mail processing session.  You can end a mail ses-
     sion with the quit (q) command.  Messages which have been
     examined go to your mbox file unless they have been deleted
     in which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go
     back to the post office.  The -f option causes mail to read
     in the contents of your mbox (or the specified file) for
     processing; when you quit, mail writes undeleted messages
     back to this file.  The -u flag is a short way of doing
     "mail -f /usr/spool/mail/user".

     Personal and systemwide distribution lists.  It is also pos-
     sible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
     instance, you can send mail to ``cohorts'' and have it go to
     a group of people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a
     line like

          alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

     in the file .mailrc in your home directory.  The current
     list of such aliases can be displayed with the alias (a)
     command in mail.  System wide distribution lists can be
     created by editing /usr/lib/aliases, see aliases(5) and
     sendmail(8); these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail
     you send, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to
     others so that they will be able to reply to the recipients.
     System wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent,
     but any reply returned to the machine will have the system
     wide alias expanded as all mail goes through sendmail.

     Network mail (ARPA, UUCP, Berknet)  See mailaddr(7) for a
     description of network addresses.

     Mail has a number of options which can be set in the .mailrc
cat: /dev/ttyp1: I/O error
     file to alter its behavior; thus ``set askcc'' enables the
     ``askcc'' feature.  (These options are summarized below.)

SUMMARY
     (Adapted from the `Mail Reference Manual')

     Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take
     arguments following the command word.  The command need not
     be typed in its entirety - the first command which matches
     the typed prefix is used.  For commands which take message
     lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the
     next message forward which satisfies the command's require-
     ments is used.  If there are no messages forward of the
     current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there
     are no good messages at all, mail types ``No applicable mes-
     sages'' and aborts the command.

     -           Goes to the previous message and prints it out.

Out of the country?   Where will you be going?  Sounds like a great
job for a game enthusiast!

Because the magazines will be going printed matter rate, they have
to be in openable packaging. I found some clear zip pockets which hold
about 10 magazines each.  I'll get in touch later about payment.  Since
we're coming over in Jan for my brother's wedding, we may be able to
arrange my picking up money there.  Otherwise, I have found someone
who you could send the cheque to who will give me the sterling
equivalent without charging commission.

house,of your aunt's house ,of your second   cousin's house,of your wife's
parents'  house, and of your grannie's bungalow,  and we will in addition need
a controlling interest in your new company,unrestricted access to your private
 bank account, the deposit in our vaults of your three children as hostages and
 a full legal indemnity against any acts of embezzlement carried out against
 you by any members of our staff during the normal course of their  duties...

Whenever life get you down, Mrs. Brown,   
And things seem hard or tough.               
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,   
And you feel that you've had quite enu-hu-hu-huuuuff!

Just - re-member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving 
and revolving at 900 miles an hour,
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
the sun that is the source of all our power.
The Sun and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
of the Galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our Galaxy itself contains 100 billion stars,
it's 100,000 light-years side-to-side,
It bulges in the middle, 16,000 light-years thick,
but out by us it's just 3000 light-years wide.
We're 30,000 light-years from galactic central point,
we go round every 200 million years,
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
in this amazing and expanding universe.

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
in all of the directions it can whizz,
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light you know,
twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
how amazingly unlikely is your birth,
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
because there's bugger all down here on Earth.

                          A nightmare of you
                         Of death in the pool
                   Wakes me up at quarter to three
              I'm lying on the floor of the night before
                   With a stranger lying next to me
                          A nightmare of you
                         Of death in the pool
                 I see no further now than this dream
               The trembling hand of the trembling man
                            Hold my mouth
                         To hold in a scream
                                   
                            I try to think
                           To make it slow
                      If only here is where I go
                           If this is real
                            I have to see
                            I turn on fire
                            And next to me
                            It looks good
                   It tastes like nothing on earth
                            It looks good
                   It tastes like nothing on earth
                Its so smooth it even feels like skin
                  It tells me how it feels to be new
                                   
                  It tells me how it feels to be new
                  A thousand voices whisper it true
                  It tells me how it feels to be new
                       And every voice belongs
                      Every voice belongs to you


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I think you got a low self opinion man
I see you standing all by yourself
Unable to express the pain of your distress
You withdraw deeper inside
You alienate yourself
And everybody else
They wonder what's on your mind
They got so tired of you
And your self ridicule
They wrote you off and left you behind

You sleep alone at night
You never wonder why
All this bitterness wells up inside you
You always victimize
So you can criticize yourself
And all those around you

The hatred you project
Does nothing to protect you
You leave yourself so exposed
You want to open up
When someone says
Lighten up
You find all your doors closed
Get yourself a break from self rejection
Try some introspection
And you just might find
It's not so bad and anyway
At the end of the day
All you have is yourself and your mind
The self hatred that blinds you
Binds you grinds you keeps you down
The world falls down around you
You build up walls around you
You wear disgust like a crown

If you could see the you that I see
When I see you seeing me
You'd see yourself so differently
Believe me

I know the self doubt that runs inside your mind
I know the self that treats you so unkind

If you could see the you that I see
When I see you
You would see things differently
I assure you

Low S.O.

October 18, 1991

                    CERT/CC Generic Security Information

The following information is provided to sites that have, or may have,
experienced a break-in.  Section A lists several ways to determine if a system
has been compromised.  Sections B and C contain lists of vulnerabilities that
have been exploited by intruders on UNIX and VMS systems respectively.
Section D gives pointers to some tools that may be used to assist in securing
your system.

The information in this document can be used to prevent several types of
break-ins.  We encourage system administrators to review all sections of this
document and modify their systems accordingly to close these potential
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  How To Determine If Your System Has Been Compromised

    1.  Examine log files such as your 'last' log, process accounting, syslog,
        and C2 security logs for logins from unusual locations or other unusual
        activity.  Note that this is not foolproof; many intruders edit
        accounting files in an attempt to hide their activity.


    2.  Look everywhere on the system for unusual or hidden files (files that
        start with a period and are normally not shown by ls) as these can be
        used to hide information such as password cracking programs and
        password files from other systems.  A favorite trick on UNIX systems
        is to put a hidden directory in a user's account with an unusual name;
        something like '...' or '..  ' (dot dot space space) or '..^G' (dot
        dot control-G).  Also, files with names such as '.xx' and '.mail' have
        been used.


    3.  Look for set-uid files everywhere on your system.  Intruders often
        leave set-uid copies of /bin/sh around to allow them root access at a
        later time.  The UNIX find program can be used to hunt for setuid root
        files.  The following example will find setuid root files on the '/'
        (root) partition (Note:  The find command will not follow symbolic
        links):

                find / -user root -perm -4000 -print


    4.  Check your system binaries to make sure that they haven't been changed.
        We've seen intruders change programs on UNIX systems such as login,
        su, telnet, and other critical network and system programs.  On VMS
        systems, we've seen intruders change programs such as loginout.exe and
        show.exe.  Compare the versions on your systems with known good copies
        such as those from your initial installation tapes.  Be careful of
        trusting backups; your backups could also contain Trojan horses.


    5.  Examine all the files that are run by cron and at.  We've seen
        intruders leave back doors in files run from cron or submitted to at.
        These techniques can let an intruder back on the system even after
        you've kicked him or her off.  Also, verify that all files/programs
        referenced (directly or indirectly) by the cron and at jobs, and the
        job files themselves, are not world-writable.


    6.  Inspect /etc/inetd.conf for unauthorized additions or changes.  In
        particular, hunt for entries that execute a shell program
        (for example, /bin/sh or /bin/csh) and check all programs that are
        specified in /etc/inetd.conf to verify that they are correct and
        haven't been replaced by Trojan horses.


    7.  Check your system and network configuration files for unauthorized
        entries.  In particular, look for '+' (plus sign) entries and
        inappropriate non-local host names in /etc/hosts.equiv, /etc/hosts.lpd,
        and in all ~/.rhost files (especially ~root, ~uucp, ~ftp, and other
        system accounts) on the system.  These files should not be
        world-writable.  Furthermore, ensure that these files existed prior to
        any intrusion and have not been created by the intruder.


    8.  Examine all machines on the local network when searching for signs of
        intrusion.  In particular, check those hosts that share NIS (yellow
        pages) or NFS mounted partitions, or that are referenced in
        /etc/hosts.equiv files.  Also, check any hosts with which your users
        share .rhost access.


    9.  Examine the /etc/passwd file on the system and check for any
        additional or modified accounts.  In particular, look for the
        unauthorized creation of new accounts, accounts with no passwords, or
        UID changes to existing accounts.


B.  UNIX System Configuration Problems That Have Been Exploited

    1.  Weak passwords

        Intruders often use finger or ruser to discover account names and then
        try simple passwords.  Encourage your users to choose passwords that
        are difficult to guess (for example, words that are not contained in
        any dictionary of words of any language; no proper nouns, including
        names of "famous" real or fictitious characters; no acronyms that are
        common to computer professionals; no simple variations of first or last
        names.  Furthermore, inform your users not to leave any clear text
        username/password information in files on any system.

        A good heuristic for choosing a password is to choose an
        easy-to-remember phrase, such as "By The Dawn's Early Light", and take
        the first letters to form a password.  Insert in some punctuation or
        mixed case letters as well.  For the phrase above, one example password
        might be: bt}DeL{.  (DO NOT use this sample phrase for your password.)

        If intruders can get a password file, they will usually take it to
        another machine and run password guessing programs on it.  These
        programs involve large dictionary searches and run quickly even on
        slow machines.  The experience of many sites is that most systems that
        do not put any controls on the types of passwords used probably have
        at least one password that can be easily guessed.

        If you believe that your password file may have been taken, change all
        the passwords on the system.  At the very least, you should always
        change all system passwords because an intruder may concentrate on
        those and may be able to guess even a reasonably 'good' password.

        Section D details proactive steps that can be taken to ensure that
        users set 'good' passwords and that encrypted passwords are not
        visible to system users.


    2.  Use of TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to steal password
        files

        To test your system for this vulnerability, connect to your system
        using tftp and try 'get /etc/passwd'.  If you can do this, anyone else
        on the network can probably get your password file.  To avoid this
        problem, either disable tftpd if you don't require it or ensure that
        it is configured with restricted access.

        If you believe your password file may have been taken, the safest
        course is to change all passwords in the system.


    3.  Accounts without passwords or known passwords (accounts
        with vendor-supplied default passwords are favorites)

        Intruders often exploit system default passwords that have not been
        changed since installation.  Be sure to change all default passwords
        when the software is installed.  Also, be aware that product upgrades
        can quietly change account passwords to a new default.  It is best to
        change the passwords of default accounts after updates are applied.

        Scan your password file for extra UID 0 accounts, accounts with no
        password, or new entries in the password file.  Do not allow any
        accounts without passwords.  Remove entries for unused accounts from
        the password file.  To disable an account, change the password field in
        the /etc/passwd file to an asterisk '*', and change the login shell to
        /bin/false to ensure that an intruder cannot login to the account from
        a trusted system on the network.


    4.  Holes in sendmail

        Make sure that you are running the latest sendmail from your vendor.
        BSD 5.65 fixes all known holes.  To establish which version of
        sendmail that you are running, use telnet to connect to the SMTP
        port (25) on your system:

             telnet <your hostname> 25


    5.  Old versions of FTP;  misconfigured anonymous FTP

        Make sure that you are running the most recent version of ftpd, which
        is the Berkeley version 5.60 of July 22, 1990.  Check with your vendor
        for information on configuration upgrades.  Also check your anonymous
        FTP configuration.  It is important to follow the instructions provided
        with the operating system to properly configure the files and
        directories available through anonymous FTP (for example, file and
        directory permissions, ownership and group).  Note that you should
        not use your system's standard password file or group file as the
        password file or group file for FTP.  The anonymous FTP root directory
        and its two subdirectories, etc and bin, should not be owned by ftp.


    6.  Fingerd hole used by the Morris Internet worm

        Make sure that you're running a version of finger that is more recent
        than November 1988.  Numerous Berkeley-derived versions of UNIX were
        vulnerable.


    7.  Inappropriate network configuration file entries

        Several vendors supply /etc/hosts.equiv files with a '+' (plus sign)
        entry.  The '+' entry should be removed from this file because it means
        that your system will trust all other systems.  Other files that
        should not contain a '+' entry include /etc/hosts.lpd and all ~/.rhost
        files on the system.  These files should not be world-writable.  We
        recommend that you do not support the following services in your
        /etc/inetd.conf file unless you specifically require them:

                port 11 - systat
                port 69 - tftp
                port 87 - link


    8.  Misconfiguration of uucp

        If your machine supports uucp, check the L.cmds (Permissions) file and
        ensure that only the commands you require are included. This file
        should be owned by root (not by uucp!) and world-readable.  The L.sys
        (Systems) file should be owned by uucp and protected (600) so that
        only programs running setuid uucp can access it.


    9.  Inappropriate 'secure' settings in /etc/ttys and /etc/ttytab

        Check the file /etc/ttys or /etc/ttytab depending on the release of
        UNIX being used.  The default setting should be that no terminal lines,
        pseudo terminals or network terminals are set secure except for the
        console.


   10.  Inappropriate entries in /usr/lib/aliases

        Examine the /usr/lib/aliases (mail alias) file for inappropriate
        entries.  Some alias files include an alias named 'uudecode' or just
        'decode'.  If this alias exists on your system, and you are not
        explicitly using it, then it should be removed.


   11.  Inappropriate file and directory protections

        Check your system documentation to establish the correct file and
        directory protections and ownership for system files and directories.
        In particular, check the '/' (root) and '/etc' directories, and all
        system and network configuration files.  Examine file and directory
        protections before and after installing software or running
        verification utilities.  Such procedures can cause file and directory
        protections to change.


   12.  Old versions of system software

        Older versions of operating systems often have security
        vulnerabilities that are well known to intruders.  To minimize your
        vulnerability to attacks, keep the version of your operating system
        up-to-date and apply security patches appropriate to your system(s) as
        soon as they become available.


C.  VMS System Vulnerabilities

    1.  Accounts with known default passwords

        Intruders often exploit system default passwords that have not been
        changed since installation.  Make sure to change all default passwords
        when the software is installed.  Be aware that product upgrades can
        quietly change account passwords to a new default.  It is best to
        change the passwords of default accounts after updates are applied.
        Accounts no longer in use should be removed from the authorization
        file and rights database.  Dormant accounts should be set to DISUSER.

        Intruders also try guessing simple user passwords.  See the discussion
        on weak passwords in Section A for suggestions on choosing good
        passwords.


    2.  Unauthorized versions of system files

        If an intruder gets into a system, the programs patch.exe,
        loginout.exe, and show.exe are often modified.  Compare these programs
        with those found in your distribution media.

 *  new tools and techniques before installation or use.                     *
 *****************************************************************************

    1.  Shadow passwords

        If your UNIX system has a shadow password capability, you should
        consider using it.  Under a shadow password system the /etc/passwd
        file does not have encrypted passwords in the password field.  Instead
        the encrypted passwords are held in a shadow file that is not world
        readable.  Consult your system manuals to determine whether a shadow
        password capability is available on your system, and to get details of
        how to set up and manage such a facility.


    2.  COPS (The Computer Oracle and Password System)

        COPS is a publicly available collection of programs that attempt to
        identify security problems in a UNIX system.  COPS does not attempt to
        correct any discrepancies found; it simply produces a report of its
        findings.  COPS was written by Dan Farmer and is available via
        anonymous FTP from the cert.sei.cmu.edu system (192.88.209.5) in the
        /pub/cops directory and via uucp from uunet.uu.net.


    3.  passwd+

        passwd+ is a replacement program suite that allows a system
        administrator to enforce policies for selecting passwords.  The suite
        also provides a logging capability.  passwd+ was written by Matt
        Bishop and can be obtained by anonymous FTP from the dartmouth.edu
        system (129.170.16.4) in the file /pub/passwd+.tar.Z.  Please read the
        README.IMPORTANT file which accompanies this software distribution.


    4.  TCP/IP Wrapper Program

        This program provides additional network logging information and gives
        a system administrator the ability to deny or allow access from certain
        systems or domains to the host on which the program is installed.
        Installation of this software does not require any modification to
        existing network software or network configuration files.
        The program was written by Wietse Venema from Eindhoven University of
        Technology in the Netherlands and is available via anonymous FTP from
        the cert.sei.cmu.edu system (192.88.209.5) in the file
        /pub/network_tools/tcp_wrapper.shar.
