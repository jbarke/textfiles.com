NOTE:  If your system has been marked down, you MUST answer the sysop         
       questionnaire again at The Atomic Cafe BBS to be listed again,         
       regardless of the reason for being marked as "down."                   
                                                                              
Note:  Many Sysops take their boards down during inclement weather or for     
       maintenance and you may not get a connect at all times.  SYSOPS ARE    
       ENCOURAGED TO "BUSY" THEIR LINES OUT DURING THIS TIME TO AVOID BEING   
       CONSIDERED "DOWN."  A busy signal is better than constant ringing.     
                                                                              
*****Thanks to our many readers who called down boards to our attention!***** 
     Please feel free to report boards that don't answer or are no longer in  
     service, or don't appear to be operating 24 hours (we make a 1 hour      
     allowance for national mail hour for those systems operating as nodes on 
     a network such as FidoNet) to us via NetMail (1:106/235) or Email at The 
     Atomic Cafe BBS. We will confirm these reports and take the necessary    
     action.  We gladly accept such information via messages.  We DO NOT      
     accept new BBS listings via messages.
