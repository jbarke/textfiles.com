Tradewars...

Martini:
You people out there like Tradewars 2002? We need a response on this one...
I'm gonna take a poll as to who likes this online game. Personally, I hate it,
especially when I want to play Doom II, but there are people playing Tradewars
hogging up the lines and even playing Tradewars instead of Doom II! Just mail
me, Martini, at the Spectrum or at the I-net address alexander.koo@spec.org!
I'm waiting for YOUR response... just give me some input and I'll show the
results in the next issue. 

Centepeede:
Personally I think Doom II Sucks.  It went out a while ago, and with Doom
there is no building up your level.  You just run around shooting people
up.  In Tradewars you work as a team, and it can take you months to earn
a respectable level.  Each planet "upgrade" takes maybe a week on average,
its not like you run around, get a gun and just go shooting people.  Die,
swear then go start over.  It really takes a LONG time and a lot more
intellegence then.  OOOOOO.. SHOOT. =).  Ok Theres mine.

Medieval Realms

        Medieval Realms has undergone more changes.  For donators, a new
node has been added, this line will Call Forward Busy to the 356-2341 number.
This means less busy signals, and interuser Lord, Usurper, The Pit and other
game battles.

Apple ][c computer for sale...
Though an antique, there is an Apple ][c for sale. It comes with a Imagewriter

a cheap alternative to type up reports or to play those old favorite games
(Joust, Lode Runner-the original, Donkey Kong, etc.). Please call 
(216)835-9725 and just mention that you are interested in purchasing this 
system. Asking for around $225.

Online Games:  Blademaster! Our most popular game, it's an arena combat
                   game very similar to The Pit.
               Archery:  A game of skill in which you can win free credits.
               Kyrandia & Fazuul:  Text adventure games.
               Super Nova:  Battleship in space.
               Super Lotto:  Buy tickets and win system credits
               Androids:  Real time multiplayer ANSI game.
Files:  We have a large collection of files on both our CD-Roms and our
        Hard Drives.  For Shareware enthusiasts (sp) we have Nightowl 14 &
        15, Pier 6, and the 4-disc Shareware Extravaganza set from PC-Ohio.
        For gamers we have the Software Vault Games 2 disc.  There are a 
        total of 12 CD-Roms online (2 empty drives) now, others include
        Forbidden Subjects 3 (Hacking, Anarchy, etc.) and California 
        Beauties (adult)
        On the Hard Drive we have a fairly large Image Base, including scans
        from popular Science Fiction movies and tv shows, Fantasy art scans, 
        and some of the hottest swimsuit scans around.  The Hard Drives also
        provide an area for new games, utilities, pics, BBS lists like this 
        one and other information
Adult Access:  We do offer adult access, but only with POSITIVE PROOF of
                   The users age.  This requires an additional form and
                   a photocopy of your drivers license. You will also 
                   receive a voice call for verification.
               With Adult access you will be able to download from the 
                   California Beauties and Amature Models 1 & 2 CD's as 
                   well as from the Adult libraries on the Hard Drive.
                   You will also be able to receive the Alt.Binaries.
                   Erotic and Alt.Sex Newsgroups.
Future Plans:  We plan to upgrade to Worldgroup (actually version 7 of
               MajorBBS) when it becomes available. This is a windows
               based Client / Server setup in which the user has a 
               special Client on their computer that does most of the
               work, enableing the BBS Server to do more. Users will be
               able to download in the background while chatting in the
               teleconference or reading their mail. There are many more
               improvements but i won't go into those now.
               
               Once we get the Planet Connect Satelite feed working
               properly we plan to pick up additional Nets and Services, 
               such as FidoNet, RIME, Weather Maps, TV Listings and
               whatever else seems interesting. Planet Connect is also
               Beta testing a 100mbps feed, which will allow us to 
               receive 40 Megabytes per hour over the satelite.

               We will be adding more Online Games in the near future as 
               money permits (people registering helps!). We have many 
               game demo's online and which ones we purchase will be based
               on user preference.

               Now that we have 4 nodes, I have also been sotting around
               the idea of hooking up to Chatlink at specific times. This
               will depend on user interest and willingness to pay.
Registration:  All New Users are given 36,000 credits on their first call
               to explore the system.  After this, however, Registration 
               is required to continue to access the system.
               To Register, you need to download, fill out, and mail back 
               to us the REGFORM.TXT and the RULES.txt files (Also the
               ADULT.TXT file if you want Adult Access). Payment is not
               necessary at this time, because you will be given an 
               additional 36,000 FREE credits just for registering.
               If you are under 18, a parental signature is required on 
               these forms. Also, if a parent so requests, specific areas
               of the BBS can be locked out from their children.
Payment:  This BBS operates on a Credit based system.  This means that you
          are only charges for what you actually do, unlike monthly or
          yearly subscriptions, in which you are charged if you call or not.
          The standard rate of consumption of credits is 1 per second of 
          access time, or 3,600 per hour. Some areas of the BBS also have a
          surcharge, which would increase or decrease the rate of credit
          consumtion.  Each function of the BBS has it's own charge, so you 
          are only charged for what you actually use.
          There are also many ways to get FREE credits, such as winning the
          Lottery, winning Archery, converting Kyrandia Gold to credits or
          Uploading files.  When you Upload a file, connect time charges are
          stopped, AND you get a royalty off the file everytime it is 
          downloaded, currently ranging from 10 to 40 percent. This means 
          that if a file cost 100 credits to download, you will receive up
          to 40 credits everytime your file is downloaded!
          Credits can also be purchased directly from us, for as little as $5
          Credit Prices:        $5      360,000 Credits
                                $10     720,000 Credits
                                $25     2,160,000 Credits
          Users can also purchase credits through our 900 number service
          (see info and disclaimers online) Current Prices are as follows:
                                $10     320,000 Credits
                                $25     2,000,000 Credits
          With the 3,600 per hour consuption rate, you can get up to 600
          HOURS of access time for $25!
Me:  I currently work at HLK & Associates, and electronics parts Broker and
     Distributor where I am in charge of Shipping and Receiving and assist
     in network management.  I plan on going back to college as soon as i 
     get some of me bills paid (Running a BBS is expensive!). 
     I do not really have any "hobbies". I spend my time watching Science 
     Fiction shows and movies, listening to music (just about anything) and 
     reading Sci-Fi Fantasy books.  I think the Star Wars movies are some of
     the best movies ever made and I am anxiously awaiting the new ones. I
     believe Babylon 5 and The X-files are the best Sci-Fi on TV. Anne 
     McCaffrey is my favorite Author, but i ran out of books to read so I
     moved on to the Chronicle of Amber by Roger Zelazny.
     My experience with computers started in 5th grade way back in 1983, 
     where i learned to program in Logo and Basic on Atari 400 and Atari 
     800 computers (Pretty high speed stuff at the time).  By the time I
     got to Junior High and High School, we had moved up to Apple IIe' and 
     then Apple IIgs', on which i programed stupid little programs in 
     Apple BASIC (I even got suspended in high school for a nasty program
     i left running on the Journalism computers).  
     Our first home computer was an Enhanced Apple IIe that we bought from
     MicroCenter back in 1986 (we had to go down to Columbus back then).
     It was a good computer at the time, considering Apple ruled the 
     educational market back then and it was what we learned on at school.
     We still have this computer, and it still works.
     I bought my first PC in 1992 when is was in Germany (in the Army). I
     bought a 486DX/33 from MicroExperts (Definitely not an endorsement)
     and had it mailed over to me.  Since in Germany the phone company
     charges for every call you make (no local calls, everything is metered)
     I did not do any modeming until returning in December of 1993. This
     computer is now the CD-Rom server (what parts are left of it).
     I bought a Macintosh Quadra 840av in January of 94, which I use in
     my Desktop Publishing business. It has a 230 MB HD, 24 megs of RAM, a 
     20 inch greyscale monitor, a HP Scanjet IIcx and a HP Laserjet 4mp. A
     nice setup and i use it mostly for Pagemaker 5 and Photoshop work. I 
     can also do custom scanning and digitizing for BBS Users, but only of
     non-copyrighted material.
     We (Me & Space Kadet) have since purchased the two DX2/66's and the
     DX4/100 along with the rest of the equipment to run the board.
     I have taken Programming in C at college and have Borland C컴, but 
     use it very little.  I am definitely NOT a programming genius. I 
     have a hard enough time keeping the BBS going.
     I am also not an artist, and will probably recruit somebody else to
     do any cool ANSI or RIP stuff i feel i need for the BBS
SK:  You'll have to ask him, but i can give you an overview.  He started out
     at the same time i did, in the Apple world at school.  He has since
     started a popular Apple BBS called the Space Station GS, which runs
     METAL and Futurevision on an Apple IIgs.  This BBS is still in 
     operation and is a good source of old apple files as well as new apple
     and IBM stuff. He now also works at HLK & Associate as the Office/
     Network manager.  He is in charge of a 12 node Netware 3.12 LAN as well
     as a 27 session IBM System 36 Mini.  He also programs in dBase and has
     heavily rewritten the inventory and sales programs used here.  This is
     why he is the network Guru for the BBS (I am better with the hardware)
