ณ                         800 NUMBER CHARGES                                  ณ
ณ                                                                             ณ
ณ    If you've always thought of 800 numbers as totally toll-free, be         ณ
ณ    aware that there are some now that aren't.  NZ9E says via packet         ณ
ณ    that a recent innovation in the telecommunications industry is the       ณ
ณ    "chargeable 800 number."                                                 ณ
ณ                                                                             ณ
ณ    Since most people tend to think that an 800 number is free to the        ณ
ณ    caller, the fact that many of these calls are now chargeable may be      ณ
ณ    a surprise.  In fact, I've heard that some people have encountered       ณ
ณ    charges for these calls at 10 times the normal rate.                     ณ
ณ                                                                             ณ
ณ    NZ9E says that if you are quoted a rate or charge figure for an 800      ณ
ณ    number call, hang up immediately or you're likely to be liable for       ณ
ณ    the charges.  True 800 numbers still cost you nothing, but be fore-      ณ
ณ    warned that everything is not always what it seems to be today.          ณ
