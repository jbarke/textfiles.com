[Part 2]

---------------------


[1;32m1:56p... yeah, it is. But lately because of my screwy working schedule, I have[5D[K
haven't been able to sleep very late. Last night I got to sleep at 2am, but go[3D[K
got up at 8am this morning, just because I couldn't sleep any later... so, I d[2D[K
did a lot of things, and tried to go back to sleep a little while ago.

[0mOh. I got up at um...9 or ten I don't remember.
[1;32m 
Sorry, I have people logging in left and right... just making sure that there'[7D[K
there's room. :) mmm. I don't have anything to do until about 8 tonight, so I'[3D[K
I'm just wasting the day away. :)

[0mAh. I see. Other people are on here too? How come they're not here?

[1;32mIt's only you and me in chat here. The BBS has a built-in thing to let everyon[8D[K
everyone chat together, but it's hORRIBLE. It is absolutely horrible. So, unti[5D[K
until I get something better, I only talk 1-on-1 to people.
[0mOh. Okay. I understand <sort of> Oh well. There's nothing good on telivision n[2D[K
now so I got bored. I was reading though. Hmmmmmm

[1;32mmmmmm. Yes. I was reading earlier. But I need sleep if I'm to go out tonight, [1D[K
so I tried to do so... :)
 
[0mWhat kind of books do you read?
Oh boy, Under The Bridge is on
[1;32m 
Under The Bridge?

[0mYes, on 92
[1;32mokee... hang on one sec while I get rid of this guy... :)  okay. Daver was tal[4D[K
talking to me over on line 2, but he left now. okay. :) 92? No, no, no. PRO-FM[7D[K
PRO-FM?

[0mYes.

[1;32moh dear. We really must do something about your taste in music. :)

[0mWhy? I like it

[1;32mheh. That's okay, I suppose. PRO-FM is kinda a cliche joke around here. That a[2D[K
and KIX-106... can't stand "pop" music. I'm more a 94-HJY, 95.5-WBRU-type pers[5D[K
person...with some WRX thrown in for good measure...

[0mOkay ? I don't really know what they play anyway. We caught this station on th[3D[K
the way up here.

[1;32mahhh. HJY plays rock, new and classic. WRX is all classic rock. BRU is alterna[8D[K
alternative, but shamefully has been heading into more "pop"ish arenas. Actual[7D[K
Actually, I listen to just about everything, except "pop", "dance", and countr[7D[K
country music. Anything else is pretty much fair game... rock, metal, classica[9D[K
classical, alternative, "new age", you name it, pretty much.

[0mMy brother is a country freak. Pete listens to 103 or 107 or something like th[3D[K
that.

[1;32m:) Oh well. I suppose I can tolerate other peoples' choices in music, even if [1D[K
I can't appreciate it myself. At the moment I have some wonderful Bach on... T[2D[K
Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor. Great stuff. I have something for every mood and
occasion.... great stuf to listen to.

[0mOkay. I don't know what to say. Hmmmm

[1;32m:) That's okay. What do you listen to, mostly, when you have the opportunity?

[0mUm...I like um...R&B and stuff. I like some older stuff too, like Mariah Carey
and I used to like Wilson Phillips a lot but not much anymore.

[1;32mmmm. I never really tried much in that arena. I'll have to pick some up next t[2D[K
time I'm on a music shopping spree... :)

[0mOh well. My tape selection is quite limited. I was never really into that stuf[5D[K
stuff when I could always just turn on the radio anyway.

[1;32mWell, for me, first, I enjoy collecting music. My business partner Jim and I h[2D[K
have about 800 CDs between us, all sorts of things. The thing is, there is a l[2D[K
lot of music that I enjoy but which won't be played on the air anymore, really[7D[K
really, and there are a lot of artists who are known for a few good songs that
ARE played, but their other stuff never gets airplay. So, I try to pick up som[4D[K
something whenever I can of artists that I like...

[0mOH yes, I see. That makes sense. Oh well. I found out Pete's handle.

[1;32m...?

[0mStarfox? Have you talked to him? He's not on much

[1;32mno, not at all. Never seen him around.... weird. Hm.

[0mOh well. I asked him when he got home last night and that's what he told me.

[1;32m:) Oh well. I'll have to chat with him sometime. No big deal. :) Oh boy... laz[4D[K
lazy Sunday afternoon... bah. How warm is it outside?

[0mI don't know. It's beautiful though. Tanning index of 9 they said.

[1;32myuck. I can't stand people who lay outside and bake... just not my thing. I pr[3D[K
prefer the a/c, thanks. :)

[0mOh! How horrible! I'm always outside. In the garden or doing SOMETHING. I thin[5D[K
think we're having a "Picknik" today

[1;32m:) I can't stand heat or, generally the sun. My perfect day: about 65-70 degre[6D[K
degrees, strong, warm wind, blasting rain, thunder & lightning... all that. :)

[0mOh gee. That's horrible. Well, sorry but. You're lucky you live up here then. [1D[K
It starts heating up in the end of Febuary in Georgia.

[1;32mYes, I know... I'm very happy to live in the northeast. however, here, it's be[3D[K
been pretty bad lately. The week before last it hit 95 here with about 90% huy[4D[K
humidity. Even at my store with the a/c on it was nasty.... can't stand that. [1D[K
I like it cool and dry. I don't really have an aversion to the sun, as such, j[2D[K
just bad heat... but I do very much love rain... not sure why. I suppose it's.[6D[K
it's... turmoil in nature reflecting turmoil in the soul... :) I'm just soooo [1D[K
deep. :)

[0mYes. Very. Um... I want to go to the beach very badly. I hear they're beautifu[9D[K
beautiful here. I live inland in Georgia, but on a HUGE lake system so I love [1D[K
swimming and such. And boating. We used to have an old boat that Pete used a l[2D[K
lot. Maybe I can go today when they come back. They went to buy lawn chairs. T[2D[K
They'll probably get lost.

[1;32mhahaha. Yeah, the beaches up here are pretty nice. I usually only go at night,
to avoid the people, sun, and heat. It a lot of fun going in the middle of the
summer at night when it's warm, but I also love going in the winter sometimes.[11D[K
sometimes... I guess it's my New England heritage... feeling the biting cold, [1D[K
whispering waves.... brings back wonderful feelings. Part of me... really unus[5D[K
unusual. :)

[0mOkay. Nevermind. Hmmm...Are the beaches that far from Providence?

[1;32mWell, depends. The Newport beaches are nice, but those are a long drive. There
are a few in Warwick that are pretty nice. For a decent, close beach I usually
go to Oakland Beach in Warwick. About 10 miles from where you are.

[0mReally???? That's so close! Wow! it's not even that short a drive to Atlanta a[2D[K
and shopping and the movies from Oakland. How unusual. A beach named after Oak[4D[K
Oakland.

[1;32m:) It's a nice place. Rhode Island is very small... you can cross it in an hou[4D[K
hour. Works out pretty well, though. Pretty much everything you'd want is with[5D[K
within short driving distance.

[0mOh, good. I'll take advantage of that, I'm sure. Wow. Now I have that idea stu[4D[K
stuck in my head. I'll simply have to go now.

[1;32mhaha. I'll probably be stopping over tonight with some friends.... haven't bbe[4D[K
been there in about 5 weeks... I miss it occasionally.

[0mWhy, where are you going tonight?

[1;32mWell, I'm not quite sure yet. Probably dinner and a movie. _The Crow_ is playi[6D[K
playing down at Apple Valley cinema in Greenville ($2.00/seat... great place) [1D[K
(and an incredible movie), so I'm trying to get together some friends to go do[3D[K
down there, and I'll probably head down to Warwick later on if I'm still alive[6D[K
alive. With all the sleep I'm getting today, I'll probably be wide awake. Shou[5D[K
Should be quite nice.

[0mSounds like fun! I haven't seen that movie yet. The last movie I saw was...um.[10D[K
was...um...I don't remember. Oh yes! My brother wanted to see the pet detectiv[9D[K
detective movie. That was REALLY REALLY bad.
[1;32mheh. Yeah, I saw that a couple weeks ago. I thought is was amusing, but would [1D[K
have been better had I seen it in a theatre full of people. As it was there we[3D[K
were only a few others there, so it wasn't as good as it could have been. I th[3D[K
think it had potential, though. Jim Carrey can be hilarious at times.

[0mYes, I like him very much. A good movie I saw was Philadelphia. Have you seen [1D[K
it yet? I got excited because I've been there many times and the setting (in t[2D[K
the beginning especially> was great.
[1;32mNo, I haven't seen it yet. It also is playing down at Apple Valley, but I've b[2D[K
been... preoccupied the past few weeks, so I haven't had the chance to see it [1D[K
yet.

[0mYou should! It's a movie everyone should see sometime. Have you ever seen And [1D[K
The Band Played On?

[1;32mNope.

[0mOh. Okay then. It's better than that.
[1;32m:) I know the premise of Philadelphia. Seen all the trailers and all... I rare[5D[K
rarely see movies in the theatre. I wait for them to come out on Laserdisc so [1D[K
I can get them there... I've never seen a movie more than twice at a full-pric[10D[K
full-price theatre, and the only movie I've seen more than once within the pas[4D[K
past 7 years has been _The Crow_, which I've seen 3 times full-price since it [1D[K
came out. Truly exquisite.

[0mWow! Maybe I should see it then sometime. Yes, I cried at the end of Philadelp[10D[K
Philadelphia. It was sad. Oh well. What exactly is laser disc? I never underst[8D[K
understood that concept.

[1;32mIt's like a big compact disc that holds pictures. ;) The quality is infinitely
superior to videotape, doesn't degrade, and usually even costs less. Very hi-f[5D[K
hi-fidelity... we have about 700 movies on LD... all sorts of things. Lotsa gr[3D[K
great stuff out there, and videotape just doesn't cut it when you want a good [1D[K
movie experience. The depth just isn't there, and the quality is horrible.

[0mOh. What do you play it on?

[1;32mA laserdisc player. :) It's a specialized thing. Most LD players can also play
CDs... good stuff. Most high-end videophiles now have them. Actually, they're [1D[K
pretty cheap. Low-end LD players start around $350 nowadays... great items, th[3D[K
they are.

[0mOh...Okay. I don't know. Hm...

[1;32m:) *sigh*... 2:29. Where has the day gone? I truly hate it sometimes when I wa[3D[K
waste away a day like this without really getting anything productive done. :)

[0mWell, at least you read.

[1;32mYes... quite a bit, actually... another of my many hobbies which I pursue avid[5D[K
avidly... hah. Hobby, my ass. It's more of a lifestyle. I'm in the process of [1D[K
opening up a bookstore in my area here. Hopefully it'll be open by Christmas '[2D[K
'95... moving along. I truly love books. Such a wonderful medium... I read mos[4D[K
mostly Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Science Non-Fi with a few historical biographies thrown [1D[K
in for good measure, and some other things...

[0mOh. I see. I just read for fun. My favorite author is V.C. Andrews

[1;32mNever known V.C.Andrews.... describe to me. :)

[0mOh! Well, wrote Flowers in The Attic. Have you heard of that book?

[1;32mno (ashamedly)...

[0mOh gee. Well it's about these siblings who are forced to live with their grand[6D[K
grandmother who's really evil in this huge mansion except they can only live i[2D[K
in this little room then they escape to the attic and get locked up there and [1D[K
one kid almost dies and they get green and sick and the older brother gets cra[4D[K
crazy and tries to rape his sister and stuff. There's a whole big series.
[1;32m 
mmmmmm..... sounds good. I'll add it to my next book order, and see how it is.
What else do you read? types of books?

[0mUm...I like Danielle Steele and Steven King and those sorts of books. Kind of [1D[K
a wierd variety but....I don't know. I have to check out the library down the [1D[K
street soon.
[1;32mmmmm.... Have you read any Anne Rice?

[0mNo. But Pete has some books of hers I think.

[1;32mMmm. Try her sometime. I have, I belive, just about everything she's written. [1D[K
I haven't really read any of it yet, but I'm starting, and so far it's terrifi[8D[K
terrific... very... I dunno... erotic, gothic... very well-told tales.

[0mMaybe I'll check them out then. I don't know.

[1;32m:) I've been re-reading plenty of my favorite fantasy and scifi novels lately.
Problem is, I take meticulous care of my books. But, some of these are out of [1D[K
print, but no matter how good I treat them, the more I read them, the more des[4D[K
destroyed they get. It bothers me... Oh well. Usually when I end up destroying
a book  after a year or two, I just buy another copy, but when they're out of [1D[K
print... ack, I hate that. :)

[0mI'm sure you do. What buisnesses do you own? You said something about that las[4D[K
last time and you just said about the bookstore....

[1;32mI own Computer Corner, here in Pawtucket. Nice little computer store. We opene[6D[K
opened up at our present location about 9 months ago. Bought the building, mov[4D[K
moved on in, and have been doing well ever since. I'm in the process of openin[7D[K
opening an antique and collectibles store down in Newport. That's moving along
well. I also do professional videography (weddings... ack. I hate those... get[4D[K
getting more into commercials and 3-D animation), which I'm about to incorpora[10D[K
incorporate in a month or so, and I'm involved with an electronics engineer fr[3D[K
friend/customer of mine... he and I are in business together doing some things
interfacing the computers to real-life data input devices... weird stuff. Fun,
though. :)

[0mGee! You must be very busy! God, that's a lot of stuff at once! And how old ar[3D[K
are you? 20/21?

[1;32m:) Yeah, I'm busy. Sometimes too busy. I'll be 21, end of August... bah. I dun[4D[K
dunno. It's fun, most of the time. But also difficult, all of the time. I'm al[3D[K
always pulling my hair out because of them. But, it's different, and it keeps [1D[K
me busy, and there really isn't anything like working for yourself. It's great
to have your destiny in your own hands, and wonderful when you can make it all
succeed.

[0mWow! yes, I'm sure it is. Um...Wow...I never knew anyone who owned more than o[2D[K
one thing...And the people I know that own one thing got it passed down to the[4D[K
them, family buisness. 

[1;32m mmm. Yes, I started all these on my own... perhaps I'll be able to pass them [1D[K
down someday. :)

[0mYes. Hehe How funny. Um, what does your mother do?

[1;32mShe's running the antique store in Newport... she's doing all the work there, [1D[K
really. I'm helping out whenever I can. One of my major investors in the compu[6D[K
computer store is the major investor down there. It works out well.

[0mOk. How did you begin to do all this stuff though?

[1;32mhahaha.... it's a terribly long story... not sure I feel like going through it
at the moment. I'll save it for dinner conversation, someday. :)

[0mHehe. Ooook. Hmm...They're playing rap. Hold on.

[1;32mI can handle rap occasionally. Depends on who it is. I like some of Ice-T's st[3D[K
stuff. Saw him at Lollapalooza a few years ago. Decent. I listen to some good [1D[K
techno, also... Shamen, et al... at the moment I'm listening to Trio Sonata No[3D[K
No. 4 in E Minor, still by Bach... very relaxing.

[0mOh! I think I hear the van. Wait again <sorry!>

[1;32ms'ok.

[0mYes. They're home and unloading a lot of junk. They must have found Apex then.
Um, I think I'm going to go now, okay?

[1;32mWhatever you'd like. :) Thanks for calling again, I've enjoyed talking to you.
:)

[0mYes. Thanks. Um...yes :) Look, I made a smiley :)

[1;32mheh. First time, I think... good to smile. Well, have a good day, if I don't t[2D[K
talk to you again today. If you get bored, give a call. I'll be here until abo[4D[K
at least 6 or 7 or so.

[0mOkay. I'm going to try to convince then to goto Oakland ;) hehehe Yes. They'll
find that funny.
[1;32m:) Okay. Well, if you go, or even if you don't, I hope you have a good time...
:) Talk to you later.

[0mThank You. You too. Bye
