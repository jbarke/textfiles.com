Due to unforseen dificulties, loss of income, and other events beyond my
control
I regret to announce that FIDO-323 is going down. I know this saddens many of
you, as it does me. Maybe someday it will go back up again, i dont know, for I
wont be here. I am going to California to live with my relatives until I can
get back on my feet.

This is the last straw!  This jerk (whoever it is, but we all know) is going
beyond being an immature pain-in-the-ass, and has crossed the bounds.  Any
sysop, TODD INCLUDED, should demand that this guy knock it off or get the hell
out of BBSing.

Todd...you KNOW who wrote this, and there's no way even you can condone it.

  Subj: Gay baiting
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Recently, one of the participants in this conference publically, tastelessly,
and irresponsibly accused another participant of sexually molesting yong boys. 
This accusation has a long, and utterly unedifying, history behind it, and, by
now, I am sure most of us are thoroughly sick of it.  But, there is one aspect
of this disgrace that needs further comment, comment it has *not* received. In
view of the history behind this pissing match, it should be clear to everyone
that the point of the accusations is not the illegality of what is alleged to
have occurred, nor the abusive charactor of what is alleged to have occurred,
nor the hope that, through this exposure, other potential victims will be
warned off.  Clearly, this accusation, these repeated accusations, are the
electronic equivalent of scrawling "FAIRY! FAIRY! FAIRY!" upon the target's
fence.  Were the epithet "NIGGER" or "KIKE", no one would be debating the
applicability of the epithet (as occurred in the past of this pissing contest),
nor would terms like "inappropriate," "uncalled for," and "tasteless" be the
extent of the condemnation.  The act of posting the original message would be
seen as a hate crime, a clear case of race baiting or religion baiting. Of
course, gay baiting has long been far more socially acceptable than Jew baiting
or Nigger baiting.  Apparently, it is so unobjectionable that hours of
primetime television are devoted to covering Danney Quaile and his friends as
they engage in this form of All-American machismo. As some of you already know,
I am Bi.  I am also Jewish.  I take baiting *very* personally, especiall#, but
not only, Gay baiting.  I also take it very personally that a stop has not yet
been put to this bullshit on this sig.  Why has that bigot's posting privilege
not yet been REVOKED FOR LIFE?  It should be IMMEDIATELY. CRG

Actually, if I'm not mistaken, a labodomy is the operation where holes are 
drilled into the skull and into the brain and a probe is inserted to sever 
nerves to "calm" a person. A power drill saves time over the hand crank drill.

You bring up a very good point. If that person is at fault he/she will have
some company knocking at the door. I think that this will cleaar up soon, at
least I hope so.

there was a guy in England who drilled 7 holes into his skull before he passed
out & died.

Anyway, the Amateur Lobotomy sounds good.  Looks like we'll be needing heavier
bits, though, it may be all skull and no brain..in which case we can use a
blasting cap to uncover whatever's there..(g)

    Lobotomies by Smith and Wesson are generally fairly effective.
Especially if you use hollow point .357 surgical instruments.

Very true. This is know play act. What has happened is something that no sysop
wants to see. I know that I sound like some big shot of the net but I am just
part of the net. Being that the case, we as a net work together to solve things
like this. I belong to more than one net as most sysops do, and at that point
you have to look out for the other nets that you represent. I am part of two
net in this state where I am or maybe one or two other that are part of. This
means that I have to very careful with what goes on here.
