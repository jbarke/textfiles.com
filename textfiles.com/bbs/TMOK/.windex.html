The full text of Jarett's writing about the scene captured in these
files is below, but here's some salient information:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
"...in the beginning there was a guy named Daver, who was bored in the
summer of nineteen-and-ninety-two, and decided he'd "hack" FrontDoor and
post some fake messages to a local BBS message network, called New
England Net.
<P>
"Daver went a step further and threw a BBS up on his Amiga 2000, running
software he himself had coded, called The Ministry of Knowledge....
<P>
"The third and possibly most important action on Daver's part was to start
up an e'zine called Rhode Island Computer Underground Society (RICUS),
which gave all of the people who had been reading his BBS and supporting
R0bin H00d in the various local Networks a place to put whatever crap they
submitted.
<P>
"This archive is representative of only about 1/3rd (if that) of the text
files that were written during the period, which I would estimate runs
from Early Summer 1992-Late 1995. A lot, and I mean A LOT, of stuff is
missing. If any of you out there have it, please, submit it, so that I may
be humiliated even further."
