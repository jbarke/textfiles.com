[Shadowspawn chatting with Kristen Bennet, a (non-existant) 21 yr old female.]

-----------------------------------------------------------


kay. Well, I'll let you finish the logon process. Keep in mind that [1D[K
there really isn't anything here at the moment. I'm only up for testing right [1D[K
now, to see how it works running all 7 lines on this one little system... so, [1D[K
not much to see. The official opening will probably be around July 11th or so.
So, over the next few weeks, if you get the inclination, call back occasionall[12D[K
occasionally to see how it's all going. It'll be a lot nicer by then.

[0mWELL OKAY BUT WHAT DO YOU DO HERE ANYWAY?

[1;32mWell, primarily it'll be a chat board, like Interlink and Springbored (well, n[2D[K
no, hopefully NOT like those... they're boring. This won't be.), where you can
talk to other people about whatever... I'll be getting into message conference[11D[K
conferences soon enough, and maybe files someday. Right now, though, primarily
a chat board. I'm hoping to go to 12 lines by the end of August. We'll see wha[4D[K
what level of demand I get. If it's good, I'll beef it up. if not, it'll stay [1D[K
at 6 lines for a while.

[0mOH....I SEE. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY TOLD ME TO CALL HERE. WHAT'S UM...SPRING[12D[K
UM...SPRINGBOARDS NUMBER BECAUSE I PROBABLY HAVE THAT SOMEWHERE TO TO CALL.

[1;32m232-0088... you don't really want to call there, though. :) It's ugly, buggy, [1D[K
and boring. Lately there hasn't been anyone on because it's ugly. It also cost[5D[K
costs to keep using it after your week or 2-week, whatever it is, trial period
is up. It's disgusting. That's one reason I'm putting this up. Up to now, ther[5D[K
there really wasn't any other game in town besides SB and interlink if someone
wanted a chat board... I'm hoping to make something better. :)

[0mOH THAT'S COOL I GUESS. UM, WHO ARE YOU BY THE WAY?
[1;32m 
My handle on many boards is Shadowspawn. My real name is Tom.

[0mOH, AND WHAT IS :)?

[1;32mThat's a smiley. Ummm. Don't take this personally if it seems I'm making offen[6D[K
offense... are you for real? I've been expecting a few people to call up with [1D[K
fake, female accounts to bug me. :)

[0mER....WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

[1;32m:) Nothing. Someone's probably getting a good laugh. :) As it is, though, I re[3D[K
really must get going. If you ARE for real, I hope you'll enjoy what little th[3D[K
there is here at the moment. If you are new to telecom, thanks for dropping in[3D[K
in, and I'm sure you'll enjoy everything fully. If you have any questions what[5D[K
whatsoever about anything, feel free to ask, and I'll answer to the best of my
ability... 

[0mGREAT! I'LL PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THOUGH...MY BROTHER IS THE ONLY O[2D[K
ONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS COMPUTER. I'M LUCKY I FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET
THIS FAR. HE LEFT THOUGH.
[1;32m 
:) Well, when he gets back force him to explain everything to you. :) I really
have to get moving, so I'll let you get back. I'm generally available here for
chat, so if you do call and get lost or just want to chat, feel free to page m[2D[K
me. It's "O" from the main menu.

[0mOK. THANKS. BYE

[1;32mCya...

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mOH HELLO?
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mHi there.

[33mI [2D[K[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mI THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GO?
I did... still do. Actually, I'm working on the board... talking to you, I'm 
on another board talking to another system operator, and I'm working on some 
stuff in the background.... :)

OKAY. WHO ELSE ARE YOU TALKING TO?

His name's Marshall, and he runs Soth's Domain BBS.

OH. OKAY. WELL...HM...?
sorry, wrong node... I accidentally started typing on your node... hang on a 
sec...
OKAY
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mah... okay. This is better. Sorry, I'm new to this. I have so many things 
going on at the same time, I get confused sometimes.... :)

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mWELL, DON'T FEEL BAD, LOOK AT ME!
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32m:) Just to make it look better, you might want to hit the <CAPS LOCK> key... 
some people in the future might get annoyed if you're in all caps. That's 
construed as yelling. :) <===== that's a smiley, btw. Tilt your head to the 
left, and you'll see it.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mBetter? Yes, I saw it...um..Sorry, but what is btw?
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mInfinitely better. heh. btw means "by the way"... you'll run into tons of... 
abbreviations. Just curious...there aren't any Bennets in the phone book. No 
relatives in the area?

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mJust moved here. Besides, why did you look me up? I don't care but....<my 
dad's a pilot, I know you'll ask me that next because everyone does> I used to
live in Georgia. In Oakland, to be exact. It's next to this huge field and 
Lake and I really miss it.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mno, I wasn't going to ask that next... :) As i said before, briefly... I am 
expecting to have some problems with fake user accounts. I'm just waiting for 
some wiseass to come along from one of the other boards, pose as a female 
user, engross me with conversation, drag me into making a fool of myself, and 
posting the whole thing on some board where everyone can laugh at it. :) I'm 
just paranoid, is all. Don't mind me. I'm not trying to stalk you or anything.
Just trying to make sure you're who you say you are. :)

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33moh. Okay. If you really feel the urge, you can look in a Georgia map and find 
Oakwood....Woodhaven St. Hmm...You type VERY fast. It looks funny. I took 
typing lessons in high school but it didn't help much.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mhahahahahaha.... I'm afraid I don't have one of those here at the moment... 
yeah, I type quickly... comes with practice. :) I've seen many high schools 
teaching typing these days. I feel that the best way to learn, if you have the
time, is simply to teach yourself. You sometimes get into some bad habits, and
there are definitely drawbacks, but in general it works out nicer. Touch 
typing has a limit of about 60 words per minute, but no matter what you're 
typing you're pretty much guaranteed that 60wpm. I type weirdly... English 
word patterns. If I'm typing a foreign language or anything besides English, I
drop down to 20-30wpm... but with English, on a good keyboard, I can hit 120 
usually... just takes practice is all.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mWow! Well, we didn't get much practice, It was only a class I took for a few 
months and all we had to do was type up papers and stuff and i got away with a
lot of stuff. Maybe I should have payed more attention but it WAS high school 
and I was sitting next to this guy I liked anyways.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mhaha. Where do you go to school now?

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mI don't. I graduated um...let's see...it's been a few years now.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mahh. Me too. Class of '91. Funky stuff. Spent a year up at Worcester Polytech,
decided to leave for a while and pursue other interests, and here I am.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mme too. I was in the Class of 1991. Oh, I never bothered to go to school. I 
think maybe I should have but. My brother was always the smart one. I always 
dreamt of meeting some successful rich guy or something...well, my mom never 
went to school either and I think she put the idea into my head really. 
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mmmm. Well, I personally don't like the idea of anyone not attending college. 
It's a good thing for just about anyone who's capable. You seem quite 
intelligent to me. As it is, I can't say that college is absolutely necessary 
to do well in life. I'm planning to go back, but I'm doing quite well for 
myself without it at this point, and I'm pretty happy with where I am right 
now.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mOh, okay. Why, what do you do?
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mI own a couple of businesses here in Rhode Island... various things. And I 
have a few more things in the works. Pays the bills, keeps me out of trouble, 
lotsa fun, incredibly tiring. :)

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mWow! A couple? Wow. Hm...all my friends from high school are off getting 
married by now <well, most married right out of school actually> and working 
their parent's jobs. There's not much else in Oakwood. My little brother has 
been out of High School for ayear, but he really wants to go to school soon. 
He took a year off so he could work and make money for school. But he's 
looking towards West Point now.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32minteresting. I hope he does well, wherever he goes. You say you just moved 
here. Is it a permanant move, or just a visit?

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mNot sure yet. As it is, we're only leasing this place. My dad's trying to get 
um.....placed somewhere good. But it's very odd for him. You'd be surprised. 
He got fired awhile back and he's trying to get a stable job for a big airline
again. In Oakwood he mostly worked private planes because the airport was so 
far away. But now we're close to basically anywhere he needs to go. He used to
fly everywhere though. He used to fly across the Atlantic into France or 
Switzerland sometimes. I always thought he had the coolest job. But now I 
don't know because things aren't as stable.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mmmm. Well, I'm sure it'll all work out... it must be pretty tough for you, 
having to jump around.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mYes, very. But I am luckier than some people. At least I was able to stay in 
Oakwood for 5 years, through most of high school....well, no not really. 
Actually I think it's closer to 6 now. I came in sophomore year. Is that 
right?
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mheh I'm too tired and lazy to do the subtraction. :) Oh dear... very tired. :)
I've lived here in Rhode Island most of my life. When I was very young, I used
to travel a bit because my father was (and is, actually) in the Air Force. My 
parents were divorced when I was about 4, and he stayed in the USAF, and my 
mom and I lived here pretty much ever since. I like the area. It has its own 
charm, the most important of which to me is the cold winters... I can't stand 
heat. I love snow, cold, blowing wind, rain, clouds... all that.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mWell, I lived in Maine once when I was very little and i don't remember that 
much about cold winters. It gets really hot in Georgia, I'm sure you know. 
It's perfect out right now, in fact. IT gets kind of cold some nights though. 
Oops I think my Mother is back.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32m:) I have to go anyway. I am SO tired after today... after this week... after 
this month. Hah. But, feel free to call back anytime and chat with me if I'm 
around. The WHO command from the main menu will tell you who's on. I'm 
generally always on one node. If it says that I'm available, feel free to page
me into chat.

[37m(1) Kristen:
[1;33mOkay. Thanks. I think it's kind of late anyway. I've got to go to sleep too. 
Well, good night.
[0m(6) Thomas:
[32mGood night to you as well. Dream well. I'll speak to you again soon, I'm sure.
:)
