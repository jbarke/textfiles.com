Bulletin Topic: What Exec-PC offers you

ABOUT THE EXEC-PC NETWORK                                  (414) 789-4210
(since 1982)

You have arrived!  You are connected to the largest, busiest, most popular
BBS in North America, perhaps the world.  We offer files and messages for:

  IBM compatibles  (MS/PC-DOS, Windows, OS/2, Unix)
  Apple Macintosh
  Amiga
  Atari ST

* Question:
Why have many magazine editors and book authors declared Exec-PC BBS the best?

* Answer:
230 phone lines, 4,300 callers per day from more than 43 countries,
one of the largest online Shareware file collections in the world, plus more
than 130,000 messages unique to Exec-PC (not shared on a message network).
This BBS reached a "critical mass" soon after going online in 1982.
We have avoided busy signals by aggressively adding phone lines and packet
network links as demand increases.  This, along with our philosophy of EASY
menus (NO menus showing 200 message conferences or 100 file collections),
and our super powerful computer-per-phone-line hardware to make things fast,
has kept us on top.  Also, Exec-PC is the first BBS to be approved by the
Association of Shareware Professionals!

Exec-PC has handled 3,700,000 phone calls in 8 years.

* Who calls the Exec-PC BBS?

* Answer 1: Not so surprisingly, thousands of sysops (system operators of
other bulletin boards) are callers to Exec-PC.  Also, dozens of shareware
distributors call here.  Both groups are calling to stock up on shareware
for distribution to their callers and customers.

--> If you want to cut out the middle man, you have found the source. <--

* Answer 2: Computer users looking for files and messages, especially people
wanting to find files quickly.  Our most popular feature is our Hyperscan(tm)
in the file system.  Our <S>can command will search through 20,000 file
descriptions and names in 2 seconds.  People who want to find files fast
will use this feature to do an easy search, then download the files, then
logoff.  Such a search on other online services might take many minutes, not
seconds.

Of course, having 130,000+ active messages in our conference system is enough
to keep many callers happy.  All 130,000 of those messages are unique to
Exec-PC.

WE DO NOT HAVE SILLY 1 HOUR PER DAY TIME LIMITS OR SILLY LIMITS ON THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF FILES YOU CAN DOWNLOAD.  Some systems stand in the way of your fun
with these ridiculous limits.  Don't put up with it - vote with your calls!

* Software Directly From The Authors
Hundreds of Shareware authors post their software here first.  This means
you get fresh versions of Shareware first on Exec-PC.  Many of these authors
have compared Exec-PC's activity levels to the other big services.  Within the
first week of a file appearing on Exec-PC the file will sometimes have as many
downloads from Exec-PC as all the other large services combined.  Here is an
example for the file PONYEX.ZIP:

     Exec-PC ...... 122 downloads
     Compuserve ...  48 downloads
     GEnie ........  48 downloads
     Delphi .......  19 downloads
     BIX ..........  15 downloads
     Medcom .......   1 download

A few other reasons to call here:  Our large system size eliminates busy
signals.  At the same time, we have maintained that friendly, small system
ambience.  Exec-PC has a philosophy of easy, direct menus.  Although we have
full graphics, color and music capability, we don't overdo it - we only use
color and graphics to guide your eye when necessary.  Music from a BBS is
annoying - we will not use it.  We want to make your call to this system as
efficient as possible.  You will notice our user interface is logical in its
layout, and does not waste your time with lots of rules and warnings - we want
you to get what you came here for: Lots of files, Lots of messages.

Some modem terms and types are explained later in this bulletin.
Terms of interest are speed, MNP, V.32, V.42, bis, USR dual standard,
CompuCom Speedmodem, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following chart shows the layout of our modems and phone lines.
Please use this chart to determine which phone number to call:

(414 area code)
Phone Number    Modem type and speed installed here
------------    -----------------------------------------------------------
FOR 300/1200/2400 BPS CALLERS:
789-4210        Cardinal brand 2400 bps modems
                (A 125 modem hunt group)

FOR MNP and HST CALLERS:
789-4337        US Robotics HST 9600 bps (MNP capable)
                (A 15 modem hunt group)

FOR V.32 and HST 14,400 V.42bis CALLERS:
789-4352        US Robotics HST dual standard, 14,400 bps, V.32, V.42bis, MNP
                (A 10 modem hunt group)

FOR V.32bis 14,400 callers
789-4360        US Robotics HST V.32bis 14,400bps dual standard, V.42bis, MNP
                (A 10 modem hunt group)

FOR COMPUCOM SPEEDMODEM 9600 CALLERS:
789-4450        CompuCom Speedmodems only, 9600 bps MNP5
                (A 10 modem hunt group)

FOR HAYES 9600B V-series MODEMS, NON-V.32:
789-4315        Hayes V-series 9600B only.
                (A 2 modem hunt group)

Note:  There are also many workstations devoted to the direct network links
supported by Exec-PC, and the Exec-PC Chat System is a 64 line system.

The phone line hunt groups are arranged so if one group is busy, calls
will spill into the next group.

WHO SHOULD CALL WHAT NUMBER:
People using standard 300, 1200, or 2400 bps modems should call the main
789-4210 number.

People using MNP modems or using an HST 9600 modem should call the
789-4337 number.  NOTE!:  Even if you have a super fast new 14,400 bps
USR HST modem, it might be wise to call the 789-4337 number since this will
guarantee your best chance of hitting an HST of any type, be it a 9600 bps
modem or a 14,400 bps modem.

People using a V.32 modem, or those of you wishing to make sure you get
a 14,400 bps connection with an HST modem should call the 789-4352 number.

People using a V.32bis 14,400bps modem must call 789-4360.

CompuCom Speedmodem's should call the 789-4450 number.  If all ten modems
are busy you will get a busy signal.

Hayes V-series 9600B modems, non-V.32 style should call 789-4315.  If both
modems are busy you will get a busy signal.

What is all this alphabet soup?
------------------------------
Communications standards are determined by the CCITT standards organization.
Numbers like V.32, V.42 are decided upon by this committee.

V.32 is a 9600 bps modem standard.  This means any modems that have
correctly implemented the V.32 standard can talk to eachother at 9600 bps
full duplex.  That means 9600 bps in both directions at the same time.

V.42 is an error correction standard.  Almost all V.32 modems support V.42
error correction.

V.42bis (the "bis" is French for "enhanced") is a data compression addition
to the V.42 feature.

MNP stands for "Microcom Networking Protocol".  MNP levels up to level 4 have
no compression, only error correction very similar to V.42.  MNP5 employs
a rudimentary data compression system that is effective on menus and other
text, but may be a hindrance on the speed of file transfers if the file
is already compressed.  Levels of above 5 are, in a word, unimportant.
V.42 and V.42bis have supplanted them in the marketplace.

V.32bis is an enhanced V.32 standard (or soon to be standard) that is V.32
at 14,400 bps in both directions.  The future is now.

HST is the USR HST high speed method, not a CCITT standard, but a defacto
standard popularized by the buying public.  Around for a long time, it is
popular on bulletin boards.  Older USR HST modems offer 9600 bps in one
direction, 300 bps in the other direction.  The modems switch these speeds
and directions as is needed for the data being handled.  The newer HST
modems are 14,400 bps in one direction, 450 bps on the backchannel.

Dual Standard modems handle more than one standard.  The USR HST dual standard
modem handles both the HST mode and the V.32 mode.  The latest and greatest
of these modems is the US Robotics HST dual standard with HST 14,400 mode
plus V.32bis 14,400 full duplex mode with V.42 and V.42bis compression.
At this date, the ultimate modem.

COMPUCOM SPEEDMODEM:  This is another modem that has become popular based
on its low price and high performance.  At $169 it gives you 2400bps MNP5
plus a proprietary 9600bps mode that is about as fast as most expensive
9600bps V.32 modems for BBS use.  See the file COMPUCOM.ZIP for
more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
US Robotics Dual Standard and V.32(bis) modem setup used on Exec-PC:

The following switches are up:  1,2,6,7,9,10  (all others are down)
The following setup strings are sent, each followed by a carriage return:

            ATC1E0F1H0Q0V1X5S7=28S38=0B0
            AT&B1&G0&I0&H1&K1&L0&M4&N0&R2&S1&Y1B0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CompuCom 9600 modem settings recommended for calling Exec-PC:

On clean phone lines:      AT&F2L1*H1%C0&D2

The above setting will give you optimum speed and very smooth scrolling
of our menus.  If you have very noisy phone lines that give you garbage
characters or failed downloads, change the *H1 to *H2

Bulletin Topic: Status of this BBS - latest info

Copyright (c) 1991 Exec-PC  All Rights Reserved

---------------------------------
12/24/91:

NO SCHEDULED WEEKLY DOWNTIME THIS WEEK.  NO DOWNTIME ON THURSDAY, 12/26/91.

"WHO IS ON" is much improved.  Check out the <W>hoison feature in the TOP
menu here.  It shows you what everyone is doing, along with other info
about the caller and their time on the system.  A bit of peeping tom fun
for everyone!

FILE SYSTEM: A new, pre-production version of the PKWARE zip and unzip
software is out.  The filename is PKZ193A.EXE in the FREE collection "C",
or in the Mahoney MS-DOS collection.  Exec-PC has not converted all files
to the new format yet, we will wait for the regular new version to arrive.
Until then, some uploads to the BBS will surely have been created with this
new version of PKZIP.  When you are unzipping a file, if you get a message
like "I don't know how to handle this file", that means you need to use a
later version of the PKUNZIP program.  So in that case, you may want to
start using this newer version for unzipping files.  Remember, if you just
want to download the PKUNZIP.EXE from within the PKZ193A.EXE file, you can
>> More? ([Y]/Stop/Continuous/) Yjust use the <A>ccess command and then use the <D>ownload feature within
the <A>ccess command.

FILE SYSTEM PART TWO:
   a. .ARJ files are NOT welcome here!  The new PKZIP is better, so why
      bother with the other formats when the new PKZIP will beat them up?
      Sure, you could make files smaller with .ARJ for a month or two, but
      when all files are converted to the newest .ZIP version, the savings
      will be even greater.  Exec-PC will not inconvenience you with any
      other types of compression, not when the savings would be defeated
      within a month or two when the new .ZIP format will be debugged and
      in widespread use.
   b. If your upload is known to require VGA or even EGA, please say so
      in the description.  A simple "VGA reqd" is sufficient.
   c. No more LEMMINGS game demo uploads, PLEASE!  It is a fantastic game,
      but the 20th or 30th duplicate uploads become tiresome!  Hello,
      my name is Dave Rhoades . . .

FILE SYSTEM PART THREE:
The Collection Selection menu has a new file collection option titled
"ATA CD-ROM Interchange Specifications".  This area is free to anyone for
downloads.  The files appearing there are for the exchange of info
concerning a new CD-ROM data format under development by an international
committee.  Exec-PC is their system of choice for this international effort.
Big and small manufacturers and interested parties will be downloading the
sample specs from this area.  If you are interested, check out the files
as they appear there.

THIS MIGHT JINX IT, BUT:
Exec-PC has been extremely reliable for the past month or two.  Many small
bugs were tracked down, eliminating system crashes altogether.  Now that the
system is stable, time to make some changes.  Lookout.

First will be the addition of the CD-ROM drives we have been promising.
The CD-ROM hardware arrived yesterday.  Many CD-ROMS will be appearing
online this winter.  The very latest PC-SIG arrived last week.  Watch for
it online soon.  Of course, this will cause NO SYSTEM PROBLEMS!  ;>

CHAT SYSTEM NEWS:
The chat system is FREE for the holidays.  If you are already a user there
you will not be charged for any time from now until the new year begins.
If you are not a user of the chat system yet, feel free to try it out.  After
you call the chat system the supervisors will give you full free access
within a day of two of your first call.  As always, paid callers to this
Exec-PC BBS get matching free time on the Chat System.

HUGE CHAT SYSTEM EVENT PLANNED:  Planned for New Year's Eve night - a huge
international live network link between the Exec-PC chat system and dozens
of other systems around the country and around the world.  Chat live with
new friends from Spain!  Play live network games like SPLAT! (paintball)
against callers from distant lands!  It should be a mind boggling event with
an unprecendented number of callers sharing a live teleconference at the
same time.  You can call in and watch the chat screens roll by at 100 mph -
it is amazing stuff.

By the way, the Exec-PC chat system has turned out to be one of the busiest
and most popular chat systems in the country.  Many nights see 60 callers
online at the same time, all pounding away on the high tech hardware doing
their live teleconferencing and playing games and sending and reading
messages.

LITEL/EXEC-PC LONG DISTANCE DISCOUNT DEAL:
We are taking our time to streamline the savings we have arranged for Exec-PC
callers.  After receiving hundreds of signups for the long distance service
last month, we have suspended the program so we can do some fine tuning.  We
saw a need for some extra options, so we did the following:

We filed a new tariff with the FCC for an even larger enhancement for not only
the new long distance products we can offer, but also for a new discount deal
Ywith extra savings and new pricing beyond what we offered 30 days ago.  This
is not a delay on Exec-PC's part, but we are waiting for tariff verification
from the FCC.

During the holiday season all people who called Litel and gave their address
and phone number will be personally contacted by our consulting company to
describe the long distance programs and to select the right option for you.
If you received any letters from LiTel, please ignore the letters.  They
were trying to keep you informed, but the letter might have been confusing
in what it was trying to say.


On that happy note, we wish a warm and inspired holiday season to everyone,
and a healthy and prosperous new year to all!
Bob and Tracey Mahoney

12/04/91:

HAYES V-SERIES 9600 BPS MODEM USERS (non-V.32 only):
We have just installed two of the Hayes V-series Smartmodem 9600B modems
on this BBS.  The phone number for the special Hayes modems is 414-789-4315.

ONLY call these modems if you have a 9600bps Hayes V-se>> More? ([Y]/Stop/Continuous/) Yries modem that is NOT
capable of V.32 communications.  If you have the non-V.32 version of the
Hayes 9600 V-series modem, now you can get fast download speeds on Exec-PC.

Bulletin Topic: Our humble beginnings, and Million Caller Milestones

Copyright (c) 1991 Exec-PC  All Rights Reserved

Brought to you by Exec-PC, largest and most popular BBS in The World

Exec-PC has always tried to celebrate the arrival of the millionth caller
on this system.  The event signifies the continued growth of the
BBS industry, the continued popularity of the Exec-PC BBS, and, well, it
is tough to recognize other milestones on a system such as this.  Other
milestones are so elusive, like number of callers per day or total hard
disk space online, etc.

Here is a little chart of our system progress.  It includes excerpts from
the log of system growth since the beginning in the early 1980's.

1980 - Exec-PC name used on non-public system
11/28/83 - Exec-PC public BBS goes online with 1 IBM PC, 1 modem.
           Bob ruins Thanksgiving celebration at his house by running upstairs
           to look at the BBS every few minutes.
11/??/84 - Exec-PC goes multi-user with 2 lines running on TurboDOS, CP/M, Z80
3/15/85  - Exec-PC charges for access - $10 for 3 months, $35 per year.
           We were running a thundering 6 phone line system with 280 meg!
12/??/85 - NASA received delivery of our first custom BBS system, an exact
           copy of our BBS hardware and software.  General Mills world
           headquarters received our second custom installation soon after.
           Both systems are still running as of 9/91!
5/??/86  - Tracey Mahoney quits her promising interior design job to come home
           to Exec-PC and organize the mess.  Within two years she will be
           working 10 hour days trying to keep up with the non-computerized
           paperwork.
1/19/88  - 1,000,000th caller arrives - Ron Ostrowski from Milwaukee, WI.
           We were running a 48 phone line system with 1 gigabyte of space.
           Ron was given a free lifetime subscription to Exec-PC.  Ron said
           the prize was too generous, made us decrease it to a 3 year
           subscription.  For nostalgia's sake, we are considering giving
           him some more free extensions.
4/18/88  - Still running the BBS on old processor-per-user CP/M motherboards
           under TurboDOS tightly coupled network/buss boxes.  Yuk, this
           technology can't take the strain.  We ordered Novell today.
9/23/88  - Turned off old hardware and our custom BBS software we wrote and
           maintained with old circa 1981 MS Basic compiler.  After serving
           the BBS community like a faithful old dog, we sold it all for
           approximately 20 cents on the dollar.
8/18/89  - 2,000,000th caller arrives.  We fail to notice who it is!  We
           are busy getting ready to move the BBS to its new location,
           blissfully unaware of the dreaded 5 weeks of phone and modem
           problems we are about to experience in the new location.
           At this time the BBS is running under our "one year new" Novell
           based LAN with IBM compatible PC hardware.  It is running with
           about 100 phone lines.

           The system is running out of our old house.  The power lines
           coming to the house are humming with the strain, bothering us
           at night.  The move to a real office will come none too soon.
10/4/88  - 15 phone lines operating at new office.  We think problems are
           over, so we start installing the rest of the lines.  Soon we
           find 100 of our modems need to be modified or replaced since
           they can't handle an impedance mismatch with our new phone lines.
           5 weeks of hangups and lockups convince us it is a serious problem,
           everyone on the BBS is given a 5 week credit when we fix the
           problem.  New facility has 400 amps of clean power, 5 tons of

10/19/90 - 3,000,00th caller arrives.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is our announcement from the 10/19/90 3 millionth caller celebration:
(4,000,000th caller announcement follows this.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 3 millionth call to Exec-PC arrived on 10/19/90, 12:19am central time.
Steve Reilly was the 3 millionth caller.

Steve wins a Free US Robotics V.32 9600 baud modem, retail value of $1,099.00!

Here is the sad story of the people who almost won.  The following list

The BBS was receiving calls at a very fast pace after midnight.  The last
1,000 calls were received in less than 1 hour, whereas normally Exec-PC
receives 3,000 calls per DAY.  During the last few minutes of the 3,000,00th
caller contest, Exec-PC was receiving calls at a rate equivalent to 36,000
callers per day, or approximately 25 calls per minute.  The Exec-PC hardware
was designed to handle a peak of about 25 calls per minute, so the system's
CPU's were definitely straining to keep up with the load.  A few people
reported getting no ringing signal or no answer at that time.  The phone
company was apparently unable to handle some of the peak redial surges
during the final minutes of the quest for the USR V.32 modem.

A final note of consolation goes out to Jeff Naujok who reports he managed
to call in 22 short of the 3,000,000 mark, then his computer locked up and
he had to wait through a long reboot to make one more call.  By then he was
50 over the mark.  Sorry, Jeff.

So that is it for this year.  Within a year or less we will be celebrating
our 4,000,000th caller.  Watch for our announcements of that prize.  It
will be a good one.

And once again, congratulations go to Steve Reilly, Mr. Three Million.

1/4/91 - Tim Semo gets the first official logon on the Chat System he
assembled for Exec-PC.  Soon thereafter he becomes a full time employee
and the Chat System becomes a value added service as an adjunct to the
huge Exec-PC BBS.

8/29/91 - Chat system expanded one more time up to 58 phone lines.  The
Chat/Entertainment real-time entertainment concept is here to stay.

9/26/91 - 4,000,000th caller arrives.

Tony Lindskog, congratulations!  Calling all the way from Sweden, we admire
your persistence in winning that modem.  It will be interesting to see which
brand of V.32bis modem you select.

Tony is a regular caller to the Exec-PC Chat System.  His handle there is
"Jedi".  If you ever want to chat with him live, call the Chat System.
Tony has been calling the Chat system at 300 baud - We think he will
definitely enjoy an error correcting 14,400 bps modem.

Normally the Exec-PC BBS is receiving 3,500-4,500 calls per day, including
calls to the Exec-PC Chat System.  As we approached the 4,000,000 mark we
received 500 calls in the last 9 minutes, and over 100 calls in the last
minute!  The 500 calls in 9 minutes gives a daily caller rate of 80,000 calls
per day!  In 1990 this BBS had lots of trouble with that high rate of calls.
This year we optimized the BBS and it had no trouble handling the caller load.

For the record books, Exec-PC officially received 8,286 calls during the
24 hours of 9/26/91.

To all of you who tried and missed, stick around.  We expect to see number
5,000,000 in summer 1992.  We will go all out for a prize on that one.

Bob, Tracey and Tim
---------------------------------

9/27/91 - Exec-PC has become a phenomenon unto itself - Us folks running
it have typically begun to step back and wonder where it will go from here.
It seemingly has a life of its own, guided by the requests of the callers.
250 phone lines shared between the BBS and the chat system, more than
10 gigabytes of storage, a 56kbps link to an international network,
many 14,400 bps V.32bis modems, custom BBS software based on exotic fully
indexed and/or hashed and/or inverted data structures for all BBS operations,
the 4,000,000th caller is from Sweden.  People on the new Exec-PC Chat System
are playing virtual reality roulette while others are blowing up eachother's
planets in a simulated universe.  USA Today, the Wall Street Journal and
The New York Times are writing articles about Exec-PC - well, I guess we know
why so many of you are sticking around to see what happens next . . .

We haven't forgotten our roots, and we remain the most generous big system
in the world.
