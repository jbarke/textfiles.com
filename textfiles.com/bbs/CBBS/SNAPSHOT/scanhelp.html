SCANHELP last updated 07/14/85
QUICK HELP: type:
1	to see ALL messages
*	to see all msgs since your last call (if "not too long ago")
-nn	(for example -50) to see recent messages.
nnnn	(some specific message number) to start the summary there.

IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY want to do a message summary, JUST PRESS C/R
(C/R of course meaning Carriage Return)

[Want info. on searching for keywords
--> To search for keywords: 
Enter the starting msg #, a comma, then the keyword. Multiple keywords may be
entered, separated by commas:
Ex: 1,software,sale,club	(The commas mean 'or')

[Want info on flagging for retrieval
  You DON'T have to write down numbers to retrieve them later!  CBBS will
remember them for you!
  While the summary is printing, press "F".  The PREVIOUS line's message #
will be remembered, and acknowledged with:
 >F:nnnnn

Now, with (Q)uick summary, and at higher baud rates, the above flagging is
impractical.  For that reason, simply press M or CR to be asked for a number. 
You can key in a single #, (e.g. 1234) or several numbers (1234;5;42;3).  Note
how you don't have to key in redundant leading digits if specifying more than
one msg #)

--> When you have seen enough, press K.  Any flagged messages will then be
retrieved.  Don't press K too often, it will cancel the retrieval!
]
[Want more info. on searching
--> A search request looks like:  nn,sss...
where	"nn" is the starting message number,
	"sss..." is the search request.

--> Search requests may include "and" and "or".
Use "&" for AND
Use ",", or "|" for OR

-> The most simple search matches any field in the summary, i.e. date, from,
to, subject.
[Want to see some examples
all bugs "OR" fixes:	1,bug,fix			
all software "and" CP/M:1,software&cp			
apple modem info:	1,modem & apple | hayes & apple 
]
[You can specify which field to search.  Want info

--> Instead of just a keyword, enter:
	x=keyword
where x=
  D  for "date"
  F  for "who from"
  T  for "who to"
  S  for "subject"
Ex:
1,f=ward & s=modem	from ward, subject modem
	This is more specific than
1,ward & modem		which also finds "to ward"

--> You may also use "not equal" instead of "=":
	Either "<>", "!=", or "#" mean "not equal".
Ex:
1,software & <>cp	software, but not cp/m
			anywhere in the msg
1,software & s<>cp	software, and cp/m not
			in the subject
[Want more examples
   1,t=all & software & h8	Msgs to all about h8 software
]
]
[Want info on finding "your" messages
The command:
	MINE
will ATTEEMPT to find all messages to you.  It scans for your full name,
or messages TO you by first name only.

]
[Want info on auto-retrieve of selected messages
Use the extended Q and S commands: QR and SR, which automatically flag for
retrieval, all selected messages.  You need not explicitly flag them.

If you want to skip one of the auto-retrieved messages, be sure to use C,
and not K, since K will abort completely back to the main menu.
]
]
Think about your keywords: CP/M would not find CPM. Better to use just CP

Review: enter starting msg # (such as: 1) a comma then the keyword
