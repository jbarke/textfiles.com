It may be copied and distributed as long as no changes are made to the list.

There are many lists of bulletin boards available. However, since there are
so many systems on-line, it is sometimes impossible to find the few quality
systems that exist without dialing hundreds of numbers. Numbers that often
have nothing to offer. This review should help to reduce the scope of the
problem by providing a short description of each BBS reviewed, so that BBSers
can call the systems that offer what they want.

So that the Screaming Electron can accomplish other things besides just
generating BBS Reviews, the BBS Review is implemented as a distributed
questionnaire. What this means is that you can fill out the questionnaire on
a number of different bulletin boards, and your answers will eventually end
up in the BBS Review. The BBS Systems that currently have the BBS Review are:

at & the Temple of the Screaming Electron.

Reviews that are more than six months old are automatically deleted. 
This keeps old numbers from staying around for years and years, and 
insures that BBSes which change over time get fresh reviews periodically.

BBS entries are keyed by phone number. You can change [1;33mANY[1;32m review at [1;33mANY
[1;32mtime by simply answering the questionnaire again using the same phone 
number. 

If you are interested in running the BBS Review on your BBS System, contact
Jeff Hunter at & the Temple of the Screaming Electron, or download the file
