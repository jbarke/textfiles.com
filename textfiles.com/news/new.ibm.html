The Personal System/2 systems units being announced replace                
many of the ehisting IBM Personal Computer systems, and are                
intended to establish a new level of function, performance,                
capacity, and reliability.                                                 
                                                                           
DESCRIPTION                                                                
                                                                           
There are two groups of Personal Cystem/2 systems units.                   
Personal System/2 Model 30, is intended to satisfy the                     
requirements of personal productivity users.  This model is                
based on the 8086 microprocessor, and can use many of the                  
same feature cards as the existing product line.  This model               
introduces as standard function the Multi-Color Graphics                   
Array (MCGA) graphics, a new level of graphics which is an                 
enhancement to the Color Graphics Adapter function.  The                   
Model 30 is available as a dual 3.5-inch diskette, or                      
diskette and fixed disk system.  Compared to the IBM PC                    
XT(TM) 089, the Model 30 provides:                                         
                                                                           
o  Twice the diskette capacity                                             
o  Improved hard file access time                                          
o  Improved integrated graphics                                            
o  A clock with calendar                                                   
o  Integrated adapters for printers, serial devices, and                   
   pointing devices                                                        
o  Improved throughput

//@AGE                                                                     
Corporation.                                                               
                                                                           
If an end user is primarily a "Personal Productivity" user                 
in small business, large business or in education, then the                
Personal System/2 Model 30 is the right choice.                            
                                                                           
The operating system software for the Personal System/2                    
Model 30 is the IBM Disk Operating System Version 3.30.                    
Operating System/2 will not run on Model 30.                               
                                                                           
Personal System/2 Models 50, 60, and 80 are intended to                    
satisfy the requirements of systems users who need higher                  
personal productivity performance, or who require larger,                  
more complex applications and operation in a multiple                      
application and/or communications environment.                             
                                                                           
These models are based on the 80286 and 80386                              
microprocessors.  They introduce a new Micro Channel(TM)                   
Architecture for feature and input/output data handling.                   
The new architecture is a significant improvement over                     
previous existing designs due to its improved interru`t                    
handling capabilities which permit resolution of most                      
conflicts present in existing systems, while balancing and                 
improving the performance of the system.                                   
                                                                           
(TM) Tbademark of the International Business Machines                      
Corporation                                                                
                                                                           
These models also introduce Video Graphics Array (VGA)                     
graphics, a higher level of graphics function, which is an                 
enrichment of the Enhanced Graphics Adapter function.  VGA                 
graphics is upward compatible from Mono Graphics, CGA, MCGA,               
and EGA and can run on the Personal System/2 Model 30 with                 
the appropriate feature card.                                              
                                                                           
Compared with the IBM Personal Computer AT(R) 339, the                     
Personal System/2 Models 50 and 60 provide:                                
                                                                           
o  Increased standard memory                                               
o  20% more diskette capacity                                              
o  Improved integrated graphics                                            
o  Integrated pointing device adapter                                      
o  Improved system throughput                                              
o  Advanced Micro Channel(TM) Architecture

If an end user currently requires or plans to migrate into a               
multi-tasking, multi-communications environment, or has                    
applications requiring exceptionally high performance                      
levels, then the Personal System/2 Models 50, 60 and 80,                   
with new architecture and higher performance application                   
capability, are the solution.                                              
                                                                           
The operating system for Models 50, 60 and 80 is the IBM                   
Disk Operating System Version 3.3.  When available Operating               
System/2 will become the operating system of choice for many               
users of these systems.                                                    
                                                                           
Operating System/2 is the growth path for the IBM Disk                     
Operating System. It will run many existing DOS applications               
unchanged. It takes advantage of the new hardware                          
capabilities, provides significant new function, offers                    
enhanced ease of use, and provides a platfobm for future                   
application growth.
