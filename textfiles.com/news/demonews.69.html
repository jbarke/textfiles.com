(BIG WEEK FOR DEMONEWS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone, this is Christopher G. Mann here.  This week, I have taken it
upon myself to assemble this newsletter.  In the past, Dan has done most of
the work.  I would just send my articles to him Saturday afternoon and by
that night he would have the whole thing ready to go out.  However, Dan is
leaving the "scene" in a few weeks and the responsibility of putting DemoNews
together will fall on my shoulders.  As such, this is my first try and I can
not promise that everything will look good.

Here are some plans I have for Hornet once the big transition is made:

    -review of music players, trackers, and utilities in the style of the
        demo reviews
    -DEMOBOOK, a collection of addresses and info from people in the scene
    -improved links > someone will be assigned to handle all of the links on
        this site
    -code expert > I'll try to find a really knowledgeable coder who can
        contribute articles and answer questions about source code in the
        "scene".  If you are one, or know one, let me know...
    -the /code directory will be reviewed and detailed explanations will be
        given to the source code within

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(HORNET, THE NEW TEAM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following people have offered to help out with HORNET once Dan leaves.

                 PERSON           ADDRESS
                 --------------   -------------------------------
             1.  Andrew Younger - aiy@mundil.cs.mu.OZ.AU
             2.  Brenton Swart  - bswa1595@pilot.stu.cowan.edu.au
             3.  Burning Chrome - bchrome@rci.ripco.com
             4.  Ryan Cramer    - rcramer1@mason1.gmu.edu
             5.  Ryan Schwartz  - dspyre@usis.com
             6.  Styros         - iq23@jove.acs.unt.edu

I will need information about each person on this list so that I can assign
duties appropriate to your area.  It would do no good to assign a coder to
review music trackers...

1. Andrew Younger - The only information I have on you is that you offered
                    me a MC][ distro site and tried to find me a recording
                    studio for the Escape CD.
2. Brenton Swart  - I have no information for you.  :(
3. Burning Chrome - You were one of the two artists for the MC][ final demo
                    and run the Piracetam (did I spell that right?) BBS in
                    Florida.  Your area of experience seems to be in music
                    and graphics.
4. Ryan Cramer    - You are one of my CORE friends in the scene.  You are a
                    musician and run the Data Connection BBS in Virginia.
                    I will probably ask you to write a weekly article for
                    "Musician's Corner" in this newsletter.
5. Ryan Schwartz  - I have no information for you.  :(
6. Styros         - I have no information for you.  :(


If you are on this list, then please write me and tell me information that
would help me decide what to ask you to do.  Even if I know you well, please
write and tell me about complications or ideas you will have.

Different tasks will include being the "Links Manager", reviewing demos,
music files, source code, and handling mail for this site.

If you are not on this list but would like to be, write me back at:
        r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu

((Section 4...Musician's Corner by Snowman))
==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There were a couple of recent releases that I have been impressed with.  Both
are by CapaCala.

First is CapaMod 2.01.  It is the best MOD/S3M player out there (IMO), and
was used as the voting software for Music Contest ][.  The .s3m support is
still a bit buggy, but the .mod play-quality is very good.

Second is BTW, a new intro by CapaCala.  Its not the most complex intro I've
ever seen, but the music is really cool.

Before I forget, be sure to check out that Acme CLAIR intro.  Its like BTW in
the respect that it isn't very complicated, but the music kicks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(NO ASM 94 MUSIC)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many people have written me trying to find the assembly 94 music, so I will
try to clear the matter up here.

The Assembly 94 music was originally kept for about a month and a half.
However, due to space restrictions, it was no longer possible to keep them
online.

If you are looking for them, our mirror site ftp.uwp.edu might be a good
place to start.  They seem to keep files we delete for a while.  If you can't
find it there, then your next bet would be to check out ARCHIE.  I'm sure
there are some final results lists of ASM94 still floating around.  Just
grab one, make a macro, and search for each song on archie while you go eat
dinner or something...

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Coder's Corner by Snowman))

==============================================================================
(PKLITE vs. LZEXE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to open a discussion on what the best .exe compressor is out
there.  Personally, I know very little about this area and I have only used
PKLITE and LZEXE a few times.  However, I'll bet that there are a few coders
out there who have some thoughts on the matter.

What do you think?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(PASCAL/C++ DEMO TUTORIAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most dedicated readers of DemoNews know that I am a very big fan of Denthor's
Pascal demo tutorial programs.  Lately, I've been converting the source and
documentation to C++.  This should increase the number of people who will
find these tutorials useful.

[How to get the tutorials]

Well, Hornet has most of them online, under /code/graph/tutor.  However, you
can write to Denthor directly and get them:

**                                                                        **

This is the list of subjects lines for the sending of files over email. This
will be done automatically. All files willbe uuencoded, see if it is on your
UNIX server or grab the dos version off ftp of the Night Owl CD's

All the files are copyright Asphyxia, and permission must be obtained from
denthor@beastie.cs.und.ac.za before using them in any publication (paper or
electronic) etc. They may however be distributed freely on BBS's as long as
no modifications are made. I will expand the list continually as soon as I
finish more trainers etc, and I will also be placing some of our smaller
intros here too.

Email denthor@beastie.cs.und.ac.za with the following subjects :

request-tut-1
request-tut-2
request-tut-3
request-tut-4
request-tut-5
request-tut-6
request-tut-7
request-tut-8
request-tut-9
request-tut-10
request-tut-11
request-tut-12
request-tut-13
request-tut-14
request-tut-15
request-tut-16                   ; These are the trainers...
request-extras                   ; Wormie, coppers etc ...
request-texter                   ; Graphics font utility

**                                                                        **

I highly suggest you check these tutorials out.  They are extremely good
quality.

(STUPID CONTEST 2 RESULTS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last weeks stupid contest centered around text descriptions (you know, those
things your supposed to upload with your file).  Had anyone ever seen a de-
scription larger than the file it was refering to?  This week we post the two
entries received...

[Entry #1]

             Here's my WONDERFUL entry to SC][!

---===<<<(((||| EXPLOSIV.COM aNd EXPLOSIV.DOC |||)))>>>===---

This program is a screen saver from around 1990 that
was in "Stupid PC tricks" by somebody or another...

The executable is 9192 bytes and the documentation is
11385, making for a description that is, yes, 20%
bigger than the EXE!

   --PeriSoft =<Musician / GFX / CodE>= [Epinicion / Interamnia]

[Entry #2]

Here's an entry to the Stupid Contest 2 in DemoNews :)

It's a file called nilv-nen.zip (I found it in my hard disk in a filearea
of my offlined BBS). The file features the 2400 byte executable, which is
supposed to be the actual product. The file_id.diz description file is
9600 bytes long! The third file is called loput.doc, which is ..hmm.. 1200
bytes long, featuring a list of the other modem bps speeds (1200, 2400,
etc., get it? :) ..

[Note]

The Stupid Contests will be put away for awhile.  Last week, I suddenly
realized that they were, in fact, very stupid.  In place of the Stupid
Contests, I will probably invite more open discussion (see PKLITE vs.
LZEXE above).

((Section 6...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================
[From Christopher G. Mann]

Royal, Stony, and I are just finishing up the Escape intro.  It should be out
Sunday night (November 6th, 1994).

[From Dan Wright]

Word has it the printing of the inserts will be completed next week
and the complete CD package will get to me Thanksgiving week (20-26).
By this time next week I should know all the details to write up an
INFO letter which shall be sent to all those on my reserve list.  Stay
tuned for the latest...

==============================================================================
((Section 7...Advertisements))
==============================================================================

   Katharsis!ASCII - everybody's favorite ascii group - would like to
   annonce a new service for it's fans.

   I'm starting up a mailing list of people who want to recive the newest
   kts!ascii pack as soon as it comes out, straight to their mailbox. All
   you have to do is send me a message at zynit@maloka.waw.pl, and i'll add
   you to the mailing list. You will then get a uuencoded pack as soon as it
   is released... ok?

   so, remember: mail me at zynit@maloka.waw.pl to get on the the list.

((Section 8...Closing))
==============================================================================
Well, these Demonews articles are eating up more and more of my time.  I hope
you enjoy reading them.  I'll leave you with a quote like Dan usually does.
It comes from Book 1 of Paradise Lost:

        "Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven"  - Milton
