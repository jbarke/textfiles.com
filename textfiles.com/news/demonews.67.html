------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, not too much of note this week.  Almost all of the uploads were either
S3Ms or MODs.  We still have 20 megs free, so you are safe in that respect.

Royal, Stony, Matt Heck, and myself are still working on the Escape intro.  It
should be released next weekend if everything goes well.

I would like to plug Trixter's Chromatics 2 which will be released before too
long.

(MUSIC CONTEST ][ RESPONSE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[From rwhunt@rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu Sun Oct 16 03:42:11 1994]

  Normally, I would have just watched as the post-MC2 rumblings died down and
  just kind of remembered the entire event as an interesting segment in my
  life.  But after reading the most recent demonews, I was rather shocked at
  the number of people who actually thought the judging was totally fair.

  To relate my personal experience in the best light possible, I would have to
  say that I stood absolutely no chance of getting a fair judging. I learned
  first-hand who a couple of the people who judged my song were before the
  contest was over, and let me just say that I was incredibly depressed.
  These individuals basically told me that they would make sure I came in as
  low a place as I could.

  Other than these two particular judges, I have had no particularly negative
  comments regarding the song, and in fact, one person who had previously told
  me I was no good said that I had 'vastly improved'. Go figure, eh? Oh well.
  I did still enjoy the contest, it's just a shame that I (as well as several
  other people, V-ANTHEM in particular) were not given a truly fair shot. I'm
  not sure what I expect you to do with this letter, but I guess it could go
  in next month's demonews as kind of a reaction ;)

  That was one of the main points that came up while I went over this topic
  in my head, although it usually ended up being more like 'if someone who
  was extremely hated in the demo community entered an incredible song, would
  they truly mark fairly?'.

  Yes, I've been thinking about a good way to do anonymous judging and such
  for the past month, since my group and a few others are planning a music
  contest whose entire idea is totally anonymous judging. It wouldn't be
  terrifically hard for myself or anyone in my area, as I could have about
  half of my group at my house (the other half is in Canada or Texas, and I
  don't think it'd be worth it :>) and use DMP with the no screen mode to
  judge the song, and then see who wrote it.

  I'm not particularly sure who the other judges would be, however. It would
  be obvious that having public judges would ruin the chances of getting a
  truly fair judging. Yes, the style does say something, but I know that even
  people such as Purple Motion, whose style I can basically idenfity in a
  second, have written songs which conflict with their usual stuff, so luckily
  the possibility is decreased slightly through that option.

  No problem. I'm glad there's going to be an MC]I[. :) (this time, I'll be
  sure to be a judge myself and keep careful track of [omitted])

[Lloyd.Yoon : Thu Oct 20 06:05:05 1994]

  First, I'd like to thank you for hosting the two MC's, it's been a fun
  experience, but I do have a couple of suggestions.  First off, I think
  the judging system needs to be dumped.  It is more complex than it
  should be, and strange results came out.  There should be no judgement
  on form, technical, or samples.  The way I personally think it should
  be judged is using a 1-10 system, for the overall song.

  A song should win because it is enjoyable and motivating to listen to.
  In the present system, a song which may be more boring but has good chord
  structure and samples etc can beat a song which simply is more pleasing
  to the ear.  Samples should not need to be judged, because if they sound
  good in thesong, that should be good enough.  If they do not fit in the
  song, the overally enjoyment will decrease, hence, the score will too.  A
  song should not be penalized for samples that contain slight static or
  imperfections that are not noticable during the actual playing of the
  module.  If it is not terribly noticable, WHO CARES?  The song still
  sounds good!  Same goes with all of the other aspects of judging.

  If it is not original, it will not be enjoyable.  If it is a technical
  mess, it will give you an earache, which in turn would lower the
  impression the song leaves behind.  It is a less painstaking algorithm
  that will make the songs that people like the winners.
  I sincerely hope that you will take this idea into consideration.

(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I don't have much in the way of coding news to report, so I think I'll
have a mini-contest:

                                 /------------\
                                | EMOTICON 94' |
                                 \------------/

Problem:  Having a :) at the end of parenthesis really looks confusing.
Example:  This is an odd contest (like I don't know that already :))

As you can tell, the double "))" looks rather odd, and detracts from the value
of the smily face (also known as an emoticon :)).

What is your solution??

I will post the best 5 answers I receive in next week's issue.

==============================================================================
((Section 6...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
And YES, I do occasionally update this directory.

I will include some information--maybe all or similar to what will be
mailed out to those on my contact list--with the ESCAPE intro coming out
next week.  Most of you know the structure, 209megs/47mins, cost $10-$13,
and tentative release date (November) already.

Much of the ASM'94 stuff (intros/demos) will be included on the CD--which
reminds me, I wonder when the ASM'94 CD will be out?  Does anyone know?
Hopefully they--the producers of the ASM'94 CD--will not harass us.  If
they do you WILL here about it here...and believe you me (HANS & FRANS) I
will not leave out any details.  Heck...ESCAPE is a part of the scene.

->I've decided to make several changes in demo-review file, known as DEMOS.TXT
  At first, second window was changed a little, a text "Music/Sound" is now
  reduced to "Music", so there is more space for sound-card configuration,
  and, a new sign can be seen now right after keyword Music (something like
  this one):
+-------+-----------------------------+ +----------+--------------------------+
| Demo  | 2NDREAL (Second Reality)    | | Graphics | 10                       |
| Group | Future Crew                 | | Music )( | 10  GUS/SB(pro)          |
| Size  | 2,496,721                   | | Coding   | 10                       |
| Date  | October 9, 1993             | | Overall  | 10.0                     |
+-------+-----------------------------+ +----------+--------------------------+
  Sign ")(" stands for Double-D, a dolby identification. In this case
  it displays demos with "Dolby Surround Pro Logic" sound support. I mean
  REAL 3D sound support, not just simply inverted one mono channel - I don't
  call that a "surround"!
  Now there is a quest for all of you: I don't have a surround decoder (at
  least for now ;) so, if you know demos that support a surround sound, write
  name of demo to: dmw@wasp.eng.ufl.edu


->Another one change is done in marking of "age" of entries:

|*Demo  | NEW_ENTRY                   | | Graphics | X                        |

  This one means that this is a new entry in this edition of DEMOS.TXT.
  In next edition, all '*' marked demos are chaned to '.' demos:

|.Demo  | OLDER_ENTRY                 | | Graphics | X                        |

  And '.' entries are marked as a regular demos.

->And the last one: now there are 501 demos in list! And still growing ;)
  I believe there'll be more than 1000 entries until May'95...
