              Quick Tutorial - Floppy and Hard Disk Operation

F1 pops up a Help File that's available at all times. The HELP file is in
two parts.

Part 1 is available when reading text. It contains a full explanation of
all standard features plus a few things you need to know before you begin.
Scroll through it for general information on the various Function
keys and short-cut keys. But first, please read the following notes.

Part 2 is when you're in the program and need HELP on a particular feature
you want to use that's HIGHLIGHTED. Use F1 to get information on that
particular feature in more detail. (Context sensitive Help.)

When you use F10 to activate the main menu at the top left of the screen,
use the left/right arrows to make a selection. When you do, the selection
should be highlighted to indicate where you are. If you can't see the
highlight, it may be because you have entered the wrong information about
your computer config. or made a typo. Exit the program and type START.

This page (table of contents) stays in memory at all times.
F6 displays this info at any time. Hit F6 again and it removes it.

Note: Function Keys aren't active when you're in the HELP or other windows.

Use ESC to "back up" or remove Help windows and (F*) Function windows.

The Windows feature in the Turbo Pascal software used in the development
of this program also provides Zoom and Resize Window features. These may
be useful in other programs (or FloppyBooks by other authors) but have no
real use in this book. I suggest you ignore these two features, even though
they are available and explained in the HELP file.

A minor program bug that seems to be beyond the skill of our programmer
can be easily overcome by an extra keystroke. Instead of waiting 3 to 6
months for the programmer to fix it, I decided to release the books now.

F7 opens a window to select a chapter. When the window is opened, use the
TAB key to move the invisible cursor into the prompt box where it will
start blinking, waiting for input. Enter the chapter number and <enter>.
(Using the TAB key to activate the blinking cursor is the extra keystroke.
 This minor but baffling program bug should be corrected in Version 2.0.)

                           FLOPPY-BASED Operation Only

Disk # 1 has the book reader software and HLP file. Both files MUST be in
drive A at all times. Disk # 1 has a few chapters on it, but other chapters
may be on disk 2 or 3.

To minimize floppy swapping, make sure all the chapters AVAILABLE on each
disk are in numerical sequence. (The numbers on the disk directory don't
have to be in sequence, but there should be no missing chapter numbers for
that group of files.) A missing file, not available anywhere, will prevent
loading of other chapters. That shouldn't happen, but it might because of a
bad modem transmission or faulty floppy. Use F7 to select the next chapter
available to bypass that problem until you get another copy of the book.

Disk 2 and 3 (etc) are put in drive B in numerical sequence.  When you
start, your computer will read drive A and can read the first few text
files on that disk.  Eventually, you'll try to access a file that's on
drive B, and the computer can't find it on A. You'll get an error message.

ERROR MESSAGE: "Chapter can't be found" means:

The next chapter is not on drive A. If the next chapter is on drive B, tell
the computer to read drive B from then on, and insert disks in sequence in
drive B until the end of the book.  Here's how to do it:

(1) Use ESC to exit error message.

(2) Use CTL-F7 to get a window to let you change DIRECTORY (first box)
(type B: and <enter>. (Directory Paths aren't usually needed for floppies.)

(3) Change disks as needed for the next chapter in sequence. Use F9 to read
the next file - or,

(4) You are reading files on drive B but have read the last one on the
floppy in drive B. Insert the next floppy if you want to continue reading
in sequence. Use ESC to exit error message, F9 for next chapter - or,

(5) You can also read files in random order. F7 opens a window to select
a chapter to read or print. When the window is opened, USE THE TAB KEY to
move the cursor to the prompt box and enter the number you want. Make sure
the disk with that chapter is in the current read drive and <enter>.

If the random chapter you want to read is not on the current read drive),
change drives first (Ctl-F7), then F7 to type the chapter number.

Once you're reading files on drive B you won't have to change drives back
to A unless you want to start all over, or random read files that are on
drive A. In that case, reset the directory (Ctl-F7) to read from A:

(Remember, F6 will toggle you to and from this tutorial if you need it.
 Or use F1 for additional help.)

NOW, hit F1 to read the general information on part 1 of the Help File.

          CrimeFighters' Catalog of Controversial Books & Videos

                         Self Defense and the LAW

Warning!  Many self-defense books and videos contain detailed instructions
on how to maim or kill "the enemy". If you're a soldier, that's your duty.
But if you're not a soldier fighting the enemy, you should know there are
common-sense rules and legal restrictions on non-military self-defense.

You can use only the same level of force against an opponent that it
appears to be, or is actually used against you. Lethal force is not always
necessary. (Most barroom brawls are not life-threatening.) Deliberately
killing an unarmed opponent with your hands or other weapons when he tries
to use non-lethal force against you might be considered as second-degree
murder! Everyone has the right, duty and obligation to defend his life or
the lives of innocent parties, but no one has the right to kill when
killing isn't absolutely necessary.

If someone provokes and starts a fight, then deliberately (with malice
aforethought), kills the other party when they respond with fists or non-
lethal weapons, he or she could be charged with premeditated murder! Self-
defense pleas are valid only when you defend yourself against an unprovoked
attack and use only the SAME level of force needed to protect yourself.

A possible exception is, when you know or strongly suspect your opponent is
deadly proficient in unarmed combat, or his physical size is such than your
ability to defend yourself is doubtful, and his actions or statements
indicate he intends to maim or kill you with his bare hands or other deadly
weapons, Then you MAY have a valid reason to kill him before he kills you.

If you get involved in a fist fight or brawl, take your lumps and give them
back as best you can. That's self-defense. If you opponent shows a knife,
gun, club or other deadly improvised weapon, and you fear for your life,
then you MAY have to kill him to save your life. Then it MAY be called
justifiable homicide.

The weasel-words in the above paragraphs are necessary because there are
many variables in prosecution and defense lawyer's arguments, and the
outcome of any case depends on individual circumstances, the State, the
judge and each individual in the jury. It's NEVER a cut-and-dried verdict!

Lethal techniques taught in books and videos in this CrimeFighters' Catalog
should be used only in apparent life-threatening situations. If and when
you use lethal force and your opponent doesn't survive, be sure you can
prove that deadly force was used as a last resort in pure self-defense.

                        Book and Video Descriptions

The descriptions of books and videos in this catalog have, for the most
part, been copied from the publisher's copy. Rather than re-write all the
descriptions to make them applicable to CrimeFighters, most of them have
been left "as is" because they contain more accurate descriptions of the
book's contents. Some descriptions may suggest or recommend controversial
actions. Some may broadly hint at or suggest illegal activity!  However,
CrimeFighters International, Inc. does not encourage, suggest, or approve
of any illegal actions or use of illegal equipment. (Just the opposite!)


No subject is taboo! Some readers may worry that the detailed information
in these books and videos can be used for illegal activity. But, knowledge
is a weapon too, like a gun. It can be used by criminals against the law-
abiding, but the same knowledge can also be used by the law-abiding to
protect themselves against criminals -- providing they make an effort to
learn what criminals know. Then, having the same or better knowledge, they
can counter-attack as CrimeFighters. Or, at least, take preventative
measures to defend themselves.

In most cases, lawbreakers already know about these books or the technical
information in them.  Many ex-cons could write their own books on these
subjects.  Some already have!  You'll find a few of them in this catalog.

Knowing what criminals know will give you insight of what to look for and
what to look out for - like booby traps and pipe bombs, and other nasty,
deadly things that ordinary citizens are seldom concerned with. Law
enforcement personnel and Crimefighters may encounter all kinds of illegal
equipment: terrorists' explosive devices, arson equipment and homemade
weapons. You need to recognize them, know what they are used for, and HOW
they're used and how to handle them to avoid nasty surprises -- and to have
"probable cause" for a search warrant or an immediate arrest!

Cops learn many things in Police Academies but seldom the down-and-dirty
things they need to know. The material in books and videos in this catalog
are written by experts in their field - whether they're ex-law enforcement,
ex-military, or ex-cons!  The authors have the insider knowledge cops and
CrimeFighters need to survive in today's world. That's why these highly
controversial books and videos are being made available to CrimeFighters.

This is where you can get the essential training you need, whether it's
fighting crime, avoiding becoming a victim of crime, or providing personal
security for yourself, your family and neighbors. Be a survivor.  Or,
better still, be a Crimefighter AND a survivor!

Please note: ALL books and videos are sold for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY!
               (Use common sense - DON'T violate any laws!)

                         CrimeFighters' FloppyBook

The following chapters have over 400 hard-to-find books and videos that
contain unusual but useful information for those who decide to fight the
War on Crime. (There's a few books on other subjects too!)

If you've read "CrimeFighters" electronic book, and know all about generous
federal rewards and incentives, press F9 now for next chapter.

If you haven't read it, here's some information on what "Crimefighters" is
all about, and how to get a copy.

                                * * * * * *

CRIMEFIGHTERS - The New Breed of Bounty Hunters, by William B. McGhee.
The guts of this unusual book is based on federal rewards currently
available. One such law (Title 18, 3059) pays up to $25,000 for information
leading to the ARREST of "any felon in any state". Another DEA reward law
(Title 18, 886) pays up to $25,000 as a bonus reward if it's drug-related!
These two alone can make you rich when you join in the fight on the war
against drugs. (Do you know any drug dealers in your area?)

In addition, RICO laws (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) may be
applied if the felony was committed for profit, which the majority are.
RICO is a very important CrimeFighter law because it provides for up to 50%
of any fines and forfeitures collected to be paid to CrimeFighters. The 50%
is in addition to specific rewards based on 3059, 886 or based on many
other laws. As you know, there's a federal law for each felony violation -
and a reward to match. This book covers them all!  Choose your field of law
enforcement, go after the perp's, and get paid huge rewards!

RICO law also provides for both civil and criminal suits - either one or
both can be used to lay charges and prosecute. Civil suits are "remedial"
whereas criminal suits are "punitive". Thus a civil suit and a criminal
suit doesn't involve "double jeopardy". If you lose one, you can still try
the other - or both!

RICO has provisions to levy appropriate fines and forfeitures on everything
a lawbreaker owns - if they are suspected of being the "fruits of criminal
activity" - and the burden of proof is on the defendant!  Any business that
launders dirty money may also be forfeited! If there's big money involved,
that's almost a certainty. Laundering dirty money via a legitimate business
is the only practical way to legally receive a reportable income.

The crook's valuable possessions may have been purchased from a lifetime of
criminal activity, but if you nail him on a felony charge, you can go after
everything he owns that he can't prove to the court's satisfaction was
purchased with "honest" money - and you get half!

Civil vs criminal suits: In civil suits, the evidence need only be a
preponderence of evidence (the best argument) not proof beyond a reasonable
doubt as in a criminal suit. In civil suits, only two-thirds of the jury
need to vote "guilty", as opposed to a unanimous verdict from all jurors in
a criminal suit. In criminal suits, maximum fines are set by law according
to the violation. In civil suits, there is no limit: it can be whatever
seems to match the violation - which may be in the MILLIONS of dollars!

Civil suits are the easiest to win and should be tried first - when the
lawbreaker is a corporation or has considerable assets to pay large fines,
or has assets used in the violation which can be forfeited (airplane,
boats, vehicles, cash and jewelry, bank accounts, businesses, etc.).

To avoid a state prosecutor's plea bargaining doing you out of a suitable
reward, you can elect to be the prosecutor! Qui Tam law is explained in a
separate chapter. It tells you how tipsters (CrimeFighters) are entitled by
law to assume the role of state or federal prosecutor -- to protect their
financial interests. Thus, you can become the D.A. for your own cases!

You don't have to be a lawyer. Plea bargaining is simply haggling between
the prosecutor and the lawbreaker's lawyer to reach a compromise, usually
over a cup of coffee. Ninety percent of cases are settled by plea bargain-
ing and won't go to trial. For the first one or two, you can hire a lawyer
to teach you plea bargaining and court sentencing procedure. When you know
simple sentencing procedure, you can handle cases yourself. Then you can
use plea bargaining to your advantage - to maximize fines and forfeitures!

Lawbreakers will, if they can, "buy" their way out of jail to avoid a
criminal record if they don't already have one. If the lawbreaker is a
corporation or someone with lots of money, the CrimeFighter (as the D.A.)
can (when legally possible) downgrade the charge to a misdemeanor and
minimize criminal charges if the lawbreaker agrees to pay large fines
and/or forfeitures in a related civil suit. If lawbreakers have few assets
or there is no agreement, a criminal suit can be used as the alternative to
punish the perp by recommending maximum punishment, giving them a criminal
record, and perhaps jail time so you can collect federal (felony) rewards.
You have a choice - they don't!  In any other situation it would be called
blackmail. But, plea bargaining (deals) are made all the time. It's legal!

When plea bargaining is used in criminal suits and an agreement is reached
it won't go to trial. You get a fast and easy "conviction" and collect your
reward(s), plus fines and forfeitures if any. If no agreement is reached
for a guilty plea, you turn the case over to a federal prosecutor and let
them handle it. If they get a conviction, you still get your negotiated
rewards - and a share of fines of forfeitures, if any.

When the evidence is iron-clad, it may be advantageous to use both a civil
suits for large fines and forfeitures, and a criminal suit for additional
fines and forfeitures (if you missed any on the first round) plus federal
rewards that require a conviction on felony charges.

A chapter explains how anyone can make a citizens arrest, and all the
things you need to know to make it stick. But, all rewards are paid for
information leading to the arrest and/or conviction. You don't have to
personally make the arrest. But, it may help to know what to do when
there's no cops handy and you'll lose the reward if they get away. If you
have the balls to be a soldier, cop, security guard or mercenary, you've
got what it takes to be a CrimeFighter! The CrimeFighter book tells you how
to collect huge rewards. This Catalog tells you where to get the kind of
training you need for your selected crime fighting specialty.

CrimeFighters work only with federal agents (mainly the FBI) and not with
local police. When you have information that provides probable cause for a
search/arrest warrant, contact the FBI.  Federal rewards are based on
federal laws, and almost all rewards are negotiable! Only federal agents
can negotiate and be legally bound to pay federal rewards. The size of the
reward depend on what you do, any personal risks taken, as well as the size
and value of the bust. (The book provides guidelines for negotiating.)

CrimeFighters are "information providers", undercover citizen CrimeFighters
without a badge or FBI authority.  You can be a high-profile crime fighter
like Elliot Ness, or stay undercover and be known only to the feds you work
with. You don't need their permission or a license to be a CrimeFighter.
It's a brand new, free-lance occupation. Anyone can be a CrimeFighter!

CRIME STOPPERS is one of the many privately-funded organization that pays
small, privately-funded rewards. Their reward formula is detailed in a
separate chapter for comparison against federal rewards. You could say that
Crime Stoppers' small rewards are designed for the amateurs, whereas the
more generous Federal rewards are for the pro's.

The first edition of this book (CRIMFTR1) is available free from computer
BBSs, and may be available from disk dealers for a maximum of $6.

CRIMFTR2, the updated version from feedback, will be available for $20 in a
professionally printed and bound book, from C.F.I., around January 1994.

Perhaps you have considered becoming a private investigator but are
uncertain about the special skills required. Well, most private
investigators are ordinary citizens just like you - except THEY know how to
locate information and people. And so will you after you read this manual.

P.I. SCHOOL will teach you all about surveillance by foot and vehicle,
unraveling paper trails, interrogations, electronic bugging and

INTERROGATION - Techniques of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The job of the police interrogator is inherently difficult. How does he
pave the way for the suspect to confess his crime while keeping within the
confines of the law? Or, still more compelling, how does he circumvent the
law when legal methods have driven him into a brick wall? This manual, used
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to train its own interrogators,
details the insidious methods by which the "mounties" secure evidence after
all fair, legal and aboveboard tactics have been exhausted.

The contents of this book may offend you and they may shock you, but they
will certainly impress you. While stopping short of physical violence,
these tricks and the mental anguish they are designed to inflict are based
on nothing less than the brainwashing techniques championed and mastered by
the Chinese Communists and the Soviets. This is must reading for every
American police officer, as well as for every citizen who might one day,
innocent or guilty, sit across the table from a police interrogator.

DON'T BUG ME - The Latest High-Tech Spy Methods, by M.L. Shannon.
The author of this book believes that everyone in America has the right to
be left alone by government, business and others who can - and sometimes do
- listen or observe everything you and your family say or do in your home,
office or car. But there are some who don't respect your right to privacy,
and they DON'T want you to have the information in this book!

Law enforcement agents are required to obtain wiretap warrants but in
actual practice some frustrated cops are tempted to "bend" the rules to
nail slippery lawbreakers. While that's understandable, it's still illegal.
But what's more important to INNOCENT parties is, there are others who
aren't law enforcement agents who have a insidious criminal intent in
eavesdropping on private and business conversations - for blackmail,
industrial spying, and credit card fraud - to name a few. These are the
jokers everyone needs to be aware of, and should learn HOW to protect
themselves and their businesses.

DON'T BUG ME shows you how to protect yourself from electronic eaves-
dropping and from the surveillance and countersurveillance experts who prey
on innocent citizens who don't have this insider knowledge!  This
comprehensive study discusses every kind of spying device, from inexpensive
transmitters often hidden in potted plants, lamps and stereos to super-
sophisticated systems favored by governments or big business. It includes
the latest technology that allows the watchers to spy on you from your TV,
VCR, computer, cellular phone, baby monitor and other seemingly innocent
devices.  8.5 X 11, softcover, photos, illustr. 152 pp, $20 (DONT)(1017)

CIA CATALOG OF CLANDESTINE WEAPONS, TOOLS, AND GADGETS, by John Minnery.
Basic to the CIA agent's mission is the ever-present threat of discovery
and apprehension. In such an emergency, he must have a tool, weapon, or
gadget with which to evade arrest or effect an escape. Over the more than
30 years that the CIA has been operating abroad, it has developed an
intriguing collection of specialized devices designed to go undetected by
airport scanners as well as pass the careful scrutiny of enemy searches.

Now, John Minnery, author of the infamous "How to Kill" series, provides an
exclusive inside look at a sampling of the actual Escape and Evasion
devices CIA has offered in its official E&E catalog over the years. The
information contained herein is considered so classified that CIA adamantly
denies the very existence of some of these clandestine guns, saws, knives,
daggers and chemical weapons. Yet the documented facts say otherwise.

The contents of this book will mystify, stun and ultimately amaze you. Most
importantly, the devices described will give you insight into the lives of
those brave souls who live constantly on the edge in an effort to uncover

EXPERT BODY LANGUAGE The Science of People Reading, with Lee Lapin.
Can you tell if a person is being sincere simply by the way he or she
stands of sits? Or if someone is approachable by the signals his/her
unconscious movements are providing? Suppose you could use someone else's
thought process to make an important point or convince him/her that you
idea is/was best? Imagine how that could change (or save!) your life from
mistakes you might make, or opportunities lost, in the future.

This video is a step-by-step guide that gives you the advantage in any
social, business or law enforcement interview situation. By reading a
person's facial expressions, verbal clues and body reactions, you WILL be
able to judge that person's stress levels and other psychological signs and
tell if he or she is being truthful or deceitful. This video reveals the
vital points of the "lie detection" courses taught to the FBI, IRS and
other agencies and then goes a step further, showing how to employ these
techniques to actually manipulate a person's thinking process!

You can buy a stress analyzer machine that has red and green lights to
indicate the stress level of a person when answering certain key questions.
A polygraph machine does pretty much the same thing. The drawback is, the
equipment is expensive and difficult to conceal. What you learn from this
video course, provides almost the same thing - except you can carry it
around with you ANYWHERE without the other person being aware that you can
READ him or her just like they were "wired" to a polygraph machine!

If you want to be an active Crimefighter, you need to know what police know
about the law. It would also be beneficial to understand the various kinds
of police organizations and what they do. You'll also need to understand
the criminal justice system and the basics of criminal law.

Most colleges have courses on Criminal Justice as well as tort law
(lawsuits). I suggest that you check them out and enroll in a semester or
two. In the meantime, or if you don't have the time to attend classes,
here's a few textbooks that you can read on your own time and schedule.

                             Criminal Justice

THE POLICE IN AMERICA, an Introduction, by Samuel Walker, Copyright 1992
This 411-page book is a detailed look at all aspects of police work, what
cops do: the good, the bad, and the ugly (police corruption). The book is
not about how to be a cop, or how to make arrests or be a detective. It's
mainly about what police work is all about. It starts with the history of
various police organizations and their role in maintaining law and order in
America. It analyzes the wide scope of responsibility, authority and
related problems of sworn police. It mentions current problems and
solutions as well as the important and expanding role of blacks, hispanics
and women in the "new" police force, and discusses their performance and
acceptance on the force as well as in the streets.

The book analyzes the image and reality of police work. "The crime-fighter
image is not an accurate description of what the police do. Only about one-
third of a patrol officer's activities are devoted to criminal law enforce-
ment. The typical officer rarely makes a felony arrest. Rather, most police
work takes place in "peacekeeping" or "order maintenance" situations in
which there is no violation of the criminal law."

If you've been thinking about wearing a cop's badge, but haven't made up
your mind, the information in this book will be helpful. If you think a
cop's life is full of action and glory, think again. The book gives you an
overview of police work in general, promotion criteria, office politics,
and what to expect from police organizations as an officer and citizen.
When you finish the book you'll have a better idea of a cop's job, and the
police departments' peacekeeping and public relations role.

The book is a second edition. It's recommended reading in criminal justice
courses taught at UNLV. I recommend it too, for all CrimeFighters. $29

CRIMINAL JUSTICE, by James A. Inciardi, Fourth Edition, copyright 1993
This is a BIG book in physical size, contents, scope, and weight -- and
priced accordingly. It is profusely illustrated in color, with many graphs,
charts and photos to break the monotony and ease the burden of reading 760
pages. However, the material itself is not boring. On the contrary. It is
interesting, enlightening, and even fascinating if you're a prospective
CrimeFighter with no experience or basic knowledge of the justice system.

The contents are a comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the criminal
justice system in America. It's far easier to tell you what it doesn't
cover (very little, if anything) than what it does cover. The following
table of contents will give you a hint at what it includes:

Chapter 1. The Rediscovery of Criminal Justice in America.
Chapter 2. Crime and the Nature of Law.
Chapter 3. Legal and Behavioral Aspects of Crime.
Chapter 4. Criminal Statistics and the Extent of Crime.

CRIMINAL LAW, by Joel Samaha, Fourth Edition, Copyright 1993, 560 pages
This book delves deeply into all aspects and nuances of Criminal Law.

Chapter 1. The Nature and Origins of Criminal law
Chapter 2. The General principles of Criminal Law
Chapter 3. The General principles of Criminal Liability
Chapter 4. Parties to Crime: The Doctrine of Complicity

Chapter 9. Crimes Against Persons II: Criminal Sexual Conduct, and Others
Chapter 10 Crimes Against Habitation: Burglary and Arson
Chapter 11 Crimes Against property
Chapter 12 Crime Against Public Order and Morals.

Each chapter explains, analyzes and discusses the law topic by a unique
method of student participation: It uses a thorough analysis of recent case
law, asks questions and provides answers before disclosing the final
verdict. The courts' decisions are explained in detail to illustrate the
legal concept and interpretation of the law as it has been applied and
tested through appeals. This method teaches by analysis of actual cases,
not by just reading the text in lawbooks. Many people have memorized the
law but don't understand the reasoning behind judicial interpretations.
This book will teach you both. Highly recommended for CrimeFighters. $49.95

The above three books are a CrimeFighter "course" by themselves. The first
one teaches everything you wanted to know about police organizations and
the cop on the beat. The second one teaches you all about the Criminal
Justice System. The third one teaches all about Criminal Law. Put them all
together, and you have full coverage. Get them all, if you can afford it.

QUI TAM law and CIVIL SUITS are tools of the trade for CrimeFighters. There
is no "textbook" available on Qui Tam law, but that subject is explained in
detail in CrimeFighters' electronic book. To understand civil suits and how
the game is played lawyer-style, "The Litigation Explosion" book provides
an overview as well as a few dirty tricks by lawyers. Here's some info:

THE LITIGATION EXPLOSION, What Happened When America Unleashed the Lawsuit,
by Walter K. Olson (1991) (An 8.5 X 5.5  softcover book, not a pocketbook)

The author of this book makes a good case to restrict lawsuits and to rein
in the legal fraternity. But he also provides the information and incentive
for citizens to personally sue lawbreakers. Crimefighters can go a step
further and make them pay for the Crimefighters' time and costs of the
investigation leading to their arrest!

Example: You must be the person suffering a loss to sue for "damages". When
you read this book you'll realize anyone can sue lawbreaker for the adverse
effect the crime rate has on our basic freedoms - like freedom from fear
when walking late at night, from the constant worry of robbery, mugging,
rape, and burglary. All of which makes most urban areas an "unsafe" place
to be.

These and other "injuries" are inflicted on us by lawbreakers. The problem
is, most lawbreakers don't have enough assets to make a lawsuit practical.
But, some do!  The solution is to use a do-it-yourself litigation Kit that
cuts your costs to about $125 to initiate a lawsuit -- which is later paid
back to you by the defendant as part of your legal "costs".

CrimeFighters can sue those they catch for appropriate amounts -- from
$1,000 to $10,000 -- as a substitute for or in addition to federal rewards.
If you do the actual investigative work, you can also charge them about $75
an hour for your time and effort, plus all related investigative expenses.

Each lawbreaker is only a small part of the problem, but each is a part of
the problem. A guilty plea (or jury verdict) provides conclusive evidence
of their liability. The civil suit will hardly ever go to trial. In most
cases, it will be settled out of court when plea bargaining the criminal
charges, or by asking the court for summary judgment based on a conviction.

When a lawbreaker has any assets, you can sue them for a small part of your
million-dollar compensation. Thus, CrimeFighters can use lawsuits to
collect an alternate reward from lawbreakers -- even for misdemeanors!

"The Litigation Explosion" book tells you all about civil suits, and all
the dirty tricks lawyers use to win and make millions of dollars. If you
use Qui Tam law to prosecute criminals you catch, report, or arrest, you
can sue them via civil suits and be 99% guaranteed of collecting a $1,000
to $10,000 award -- when the guilty party has sufficient assets to pay.

Read this book to learn all about civil suits and how you can use them to
collect "awards" as well as rewards, and how to win virtually every lawsuit
you initiate on your own -- without the assistance of a lawyer.
THE LITIGATION EXPLOSION (LITIGATE)(5019) $13


WITH JUSTICE FOR NONE,by Gerry Spence (1989), 8.5 X 5.5" softcover book.

"A scathing indictment of how law is taught, practiced, and administered in
this country... One of the best books ever written on the law." - The
Denver Post.

This book, like The Litigation Explosion, is a critical examination of the
law and corporate lawyers in particular. The writer, a well-know lawyer
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, knows what he writes about and he does it well.
The book is entertaining because of the author's style of writing and home-
spun humor. It's a pleasure to read. More important, it provides overlooked
facts of HOW the law is being abused in the name of "justice", with justice
for none.

The contents of his book explains all the evils of the law as it now stands
in civil litigation - the "unfairness" of tort law (lawsuits). It also
mentions a lot of insider information on prosecutors and judges. If you
plan on using civil suits, read this book. It's worth the price and the
time to read it. You'll learn from it. (JUSTICE.F.N.)(3025) $10

                     Security Guards and CrimeFighters

Private Security and the Law, written by Charles P. Nemeth
This book is a unique training Manual for Security Guards and CrimeFighters
As the book explains, a security guard has no more police authority than a
civilian. Accordingly, everything in the book that's directed at security
guards also applies to CrimeFighters!

The book includes (among other things): The Law of Arrest, Search and
seizure - applications in the private sector; Civil and Criminal liability
of security personnel; The enforcement of laws and interpretation of
evidence; Public and private law enforcement.

It also includes dozens of examples and case histories explaining various
scenarios and court decisions. It's a recent publication (1989) and tailor-
made for CrimeFighters. Every CrimeFighter needs to know all they can learn
about citizens arrests and the inherent dangers if they don't know WHAT to
do, what NOT to do, and WHY.

If you make an arrest for a felony while on duty as a security guard, you
may not get a big reward, but you are eligible to apply under Title 18,
USCS 3059. If the reward isn't as much as you think it's worth, and there
may be some fines and forfeitures involved, consider prosecuting the case
yourself via Qui Tam law. You can also consider a lawsuit against the
lawbreaker to get paid a $1,000+ award.

The pay for a security guard is minimal. But, being a rent-a-cop puts you
in a position to look for lawbreakers; make citizen arrests; be eligible
for rewards; use Qui Tam law to be the prosecutor; and sue the perp's (if
they have any assets). A security guard's job might be considered as basic
training to get experience in a CrimeFighter role - doing all of the above.
This college-level textbook is recommended reading for all security guards
and serious CrimeFighters. $26  (P.SECURITY)(3028)

interviewing. Do these techniques really work? Will you lose a job, get
fined or even go to jail because of a false positive on a shaky system?
Learn how these systems work and how to manipulate the tests and testers to
mislead anyone, anything, anytime - and get away with it.

BREAK CONTACT, CONTINUE MISSION, by Raymond D. Harris
The men of MACV-SOG; they were the elite combat troops of the U.S. Army
Special Forces, carrying out the most dangerous missions of the Vietnam
War. Secretly inserted by Huey helicopters deep into Laos, Cambodia and
North Vietnam, SOG recon patrols moved silently through enemy sanctuaries
deep in the hills and jungles, gathering military intelligence, snatching
prisoners and calling in air strikes. If the team was discovered, they had
to fight their way to the nearest clearing against overwhelming odds,
praying that the rescue choppers would arrive instead of orders to "break
contact, continue mission."

In his widely praised first novel, MACV-SOG veteran Ray Harris tells the
story of Ted Garner, a recon sergeant running missions out of the CCC
compound south of Kontum. In what Special Forces vets have called
"extraordinary," "haunting" and "one of the best" accounts of special
operations in the Vietnam War, Harris describes the faith, fear and
friendship that bound the men of SOG, and with stark and brutal honesty
unveils the meaning behind the unit's motto: "YOU HAVE NEVER LIVED UNTIL
YOU'VE ALMOST DIED."

While this is a fictionalized version of what it was all about, it's also
based on the author's personal and actual experience in this unique outfit.
Absolutely fascinating reading, especially for Vietnam vet's.

too, it's written expressly for lawman - to learn how to take out a
terrorist sniper who is threatening or killing innocent people. It contains
everything the countersniper needs to know about ammunition, rifles,
sights, how to deal with noise and muzzle flash, stable and unstable
shooting positions and a lot more. It's a small booklet because it deals
only with a specific topic - countersniping! (or game poachers?)

SEALs IN VIETNAM - An Inside Look
In the jungles of Vietnam, U.S. Navy SEALs waged a war of terror against

moved like shadows through VC territory, causing a ripple of hysteria
throughout enemy sanctuaries as villagers awoke to find proof of their
silent, deadly presence the night before.

AMBUSH! - Navy SEALs in Deadly Action
The most devastating terror tactic of U.S. Navy SEALs in Vietnam was the
ambush. SEALs were experts at delivering themselves silently to ambush
sites, setting up kill zones and laying down blankets of fire from which no
enemy could escape. Occasional survivors returned to their villages with
chilling tales of the "men with green faces" appearing out of nowhere,
bringing sudden, violent death.

This video features all-new, never-before-seen footage from the personal
archives of SEAL veterans. This is not a rehash of SEAL history - rather,
it is an instructional video on the art of the ambush as told by the men
who perfected the tactic. SEAL vets describe what it was like to go out on
"wham and scram" operations, the differences between planned vs. hasty
ambushes, unconventional methods used only by SEAL teams, the vital
importance of the elements of surprise and all the explicit details of
springing a successful ambush. Filmed with the cooperation of the UDT/SEAL
Museum, AMBUSH! is the ultimate video on how America's deadliest warriors
carried out their deadliest missions.

World War II to today's "dirty little wars." See UDT (Underwater Demolition
Teams) clearing the beaches prior to landing at Guam, Normandy and Inchon;
SEALs waging a deadly guerrilla war against the Vietcong in the canals and

during the Grenada operation, protecting U.S. shipping interests in the
Middle East and spearheading the invasion of Panama. Much of this material
has never been available to the public - until now.

BOUNTY HUNTER - by Bob Burton.
"No body, no booty" is the motto of the modern bountyman. Like his Wild
West counterpart, he tracks the bail fugitive, arrests him in the name of
justice and surrenders him to the police - all for the love of money.

Learn how to talk your way into a bondsman's confidence, acquire the
necessary tools, track and subdue the fugitive, and a whole lot more. And,
compiled for the first time, here is a state-by-state list of the laws of
bounty hunting. With an estimated six million bail jumpers walking the
streets, bounty hunting can be a gold mine for the smart and the daring.

Note: CrimeFighters are bounty hunters too, but the name "bounty hunters"
has been adopted by bail bound recovery agents for many years. The name of
Bounty Hunters is widely used and recognized by law enforcement agencies as
being related mainly with bail bond activity. Even though CrimeFighters are
more like the original bounty hunters (in the Wild West tradition, like
Clint Eastwood in "Hang 'em High"), we'll use our own unique name to create
our own identity with law enforcement people.  While you can be both a
CrimeFighter and a bounty hunter, the name "CrimeFighters" indicates the
difference of our unique role, and much broader activity in law enforcement.

INSTINCT COMBAT SHOOTING, Defensive Handgunning for Police and Personal
Protection.  By Chuck Klein, Foreword by Bradley J. Steiner.
In a gunfight, missed shots and lost time can result in lost life - your
own. That's why CHECKING YOUR SIGHT PICTURE IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU
CAN DO! During close-quarters combat, when fractions of seconds can mean
the difference between living and dying, you don't want to be doing
anything but pulling the trigger.

It's just plain common sense to keep you eyes focused on the danger in an
armed confrontation - a natural, instinctive reaction. This updated and
expanded version of Chuck Klein's original book will help you hone those
instincts and reinforce them with learned and accurate pistol control.
You'll learn the key techniques of instinct shooting, including how to
identify the smallest centralized target, focus your eyes at the correct
distance and concentrate fully on your target. Plus, you'll be able to
perform realistic combat drills and receive a different kind of target
instruction that exchanges luck for skill.... and which would you rather
depend on when your life's on the line?

BUSINESS PARTNERS - The Best Pistol/Ammunition Combinations for Personal
Defense. By Peter Alan Kasler.
If you stake your life on the "manstopping" power of your double-action
pistol and ammunition, you'd better get the facts. This book is a serious
critique of the wounding capabilities of handguns and ammo designed for
"business" situations - when one's life is on the line.

Debunking dangerous misconceptions that have been perpetuated over the
years, the author reveals the true physiological and psychological factors
of handgun wounding effectiveness. He then takes a hard look at the strong
and weak points of 9mm, 10mm, .40 caliber and .45 ACP ammo, and compares
major-caliber pistols from Colt, S&W, Browning, Glock, SIG-Sauer, Beretta,
IMI and others. The result: a practical assessment of the best pistol/ammo
combinations - which bullets work best in which guns to get the job done in
a life-and-death situation. 5.5 X 8.5, hardcvr, photos, illus, 200 pp, $23

GLOCK - The New Wave in Combat Handguns. By Peter Kasler.
Popularized by the media as the "all-plastic gun," the "terrorist special"
and the "gun that can pass undetected through airport security systems,"
the Glock pistol is actually none of these. Since its debut in 1985, the
Glock has been the subject of considerable controversy. What are the
advantages of Polymer 2, the "space-age" plastic of which many of its parts
are made? How many different Glock models are there, and what calibers are
they offered in? Does the Glock's light weight make it "kick" more than a
heavier gun? How safe is its unique "safe-action" trigger system - does it
increase the chance of accidental discharge?

In this book, the author debunks the myths, lays to rest the rumors and,
through photos of a special cutaway Glock that clearly display its inner
mechanisms, demystifies the design and operations of what is the most
innovative handgun to be introduced in some time - and possibly in the
history of firearms. 5.5 X 8.5, hardcover, photos, illust., 304 pp, $25

POWERHOUSE PISTOLS - The Colt 1911 and Browning Hi-Power Sourcebook.
By Duncan Long.
Weapons expert Duncan Long gives shooters an in-depth look at the two most
powerful auto pistols ever created - the Colt 1911 (.45) and 9mm Browning
Hi-Power. The Author explains why the 1911 is considered to be the best
pistol design ever and why the Hi-Power is the most widely-used sidearm in
the free world. Part of the proof of each pistol's popularity lies in the
number of spinoffs each has generated, and Long evaluates specimens from
these also, from Springfield Armory's Defender to the Soviet Tokarev.

Combatants, collectors and hunters interested in practical considerations
such as price, performance and availability will benefit from the author's
straightforward discussions on internal mechanisms, outward design, test-
firing results, maintenance and accessories.

THE MODERN TECHNIQUE OF THE PISTOL, by Greg B. Morrison & Jeff Cooper
This book offers peace of mind. It teaches the modern pistol technique
perfected over the past thirty years through the efforts of Jeff Cooper and
his staff at American Pistol Institute.

You don't have the time to miss in a pistol fight, but too many shooters
believe that all they need to know is marksmanship! Actuality, marksmanship
is just the LAST step in a long list of means to an end. The best marksman
in the world can be defeated if he has not prepared his mind, instilled
correct management skills and given sufficient thought and training time to
TACTICS. Thus, the emphasis of THE MODERN TECHNIQUE OF THE PISTOL is on
mind-set first, gunhandling second, and marksmanship last. This book and
its information could make the difference between life and death for
housewives, businessmen, police officers and military combatants. 8.5 X 11,
hardcover, photos, 176 pp, $45 (MODERN)(1024)

(Editor's note: This book's most important lesson is mind-set: psyching
yourself out ahead of time to do what must be done automatically.
Hesitation at critical moments can be deadly. There must be no mental
wrestling over something that should have been rehearsed mentally many
times - to USE deadly force when necessary. This book will help to prepare
you for deadly confrontations. Tactics is the next important thing to learn
- what to do under various conditions and circumstances. Marksmanship is
critical, of course, but the first two are more important because if you
flunk the first two steps, you may never get a chance to fire your weapon!
"Live" courses taught at Gunsite, Arizona (at Jeff Cooper's A.P.I.) cost
hundreds of dollars and are worth it.  But, if you don't have the time or
can't afford to attend API, this book and others like it, are inexpensive
alternatives.)

LEAD POISONING - 25 True Stories From the Wrong End of a Gun.
By Chris Pfouts.
There are two ways this book can save your life. First, if you've never
been shot, there are vital lessons to be learned from the stories of those
who have. How did the presence of a nickel-plated handgun save one man's
life? How can one person get dropped by a bullet in the arm, while another
gets shot full in the face and yet manages to throw his adversary out of a
second-story window? The answers to these questions and many more, are
found in these real-life accounts. They provide valuable insight into the
violent world of gunplay. This is the gritty reality behind gunshot
statistics and wound ballistic studies.

If you have been shot, or might reasonably expect to be in the future
because of your occupation or other factors, this extraordinary book will
help you sort out the experience better than any unknowing pain therapist
or psychiatrist could ever hope to. This book contains the real-life
stories of 25 people like yourself who were put through the most traumatic
experience of their lives yet lived to talk about it, heal, and go on.

HIDDEN THREAT - A Guide to Covert Weapons. By Mark Smith.
A belt buckle that holds a functional black powder revolver, a wicked
little knife concealed in a comb case, a shotgun disguised as a common
highway flare - these items are not the stuff of spy thrillers. They are
disguised weapons in use today on the streets of America that can pose a
deadly threat to anyone who encounters them.

Intended for use by law-enforcement personnel, this book provides a
fascinating glimpse into the darker side of police work, a world in which
things are not always what they seem to be. HIDDEN THREAT illustrates
objects offered for sale by commercial manufacturers, improvised weapons
and items that have been modified or booby-trapped to create a nasty
surprise. This book will aid security professionals in the detection of
covert and improvised weapons and help informed citizens and CrimeFighters
to recognize innocent-looking items that can be used to lethal advantage.

HANDGUN STOPPING POWER - The Definitive Study
By Evan P. Marshall & Edwin J. Sanow
Dramatic firsthand accounts of the results of handgun rounds fired into
criminals by cops, store owners and a host of others are the heart and soul
of this long-awaited and controversial book by firearms experts Evan
Marshall and Ed Sanow. Their goal is to provide an accurate wound
ballistics and ammunition information that police officers and civilians
can use to survive lethal confrontations on the street.

The use of results of shooting incidents - gathered from such sources as
police reports, autopsies and victim statements - sets this book apart from
all others of its kind, leaving no further need for "expert" opinions or
outdated theories. By combining these case studies of actual shootings with
scientifically controlled test firings into 10-percent ordnance gelatin,
the authors have developed what may be the definitive methodology for
predicting the stopping power of any handgun load. All other theories and
formulas fade in comparison to this detailed data - what REALLY happens
when a bullet meets a man.  8.5 X 11, hardcover, photos, 240 pp, $40

This FBI study analyzes the factors involved in handgun wounding and the
relative effectiveness of 9mm and .45 caliber ammunition in brute stopping
force. It is a revealing look at the elements that are vital for maximizing
tissue damage and dropping an individual before he can be of further danger
to you. Includes discussions of the importance on penetrating power, the
limitations of any handgun in stopping a determined opponent and a good
argument for increased magazine capacity.

WARNING! Be advised you must obtain a permit from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to own and use full-auto weapons, silencers and
other "restricted" weapons, and in some states, to make and use explosives
and/or explosive devices. BATF requires a separate licensing application.
BATF guidelines are included in some books that show how to convert or make
restricted weapons - when BATF regulations apply.

Other temporary conversions, may or may not require BATF licensing. If not,
the author usually mentions that fact. If the author fails to mention it,
be warned that it might be illegal if you don't have a permit for it!
Please check with BATF guidelines before you make any conversions. ALSO,
check your own state laws for licensing requirements.

Just because the information is legally available in books by virtue of the
First Amendment (Freedom of the Press) doesn't mean it's legal to do it,
make it, or use it!  Publishers of such books usually mention in each

THE STURM RUGER 10/22 RIFLE AND .44 MAGNUM CARBINE, By Duncan Long.
Legendary reliability and classic design are the hallmarks of the Ruger
10/22 rifle and .44 Magnum Carbine. Originally conceived as a practice

specifications in this book. In it, the author does for the shotgun what he

unsurpassed accuracy and lethality within 25 yards while expanding its
range to more than 100 yards, increasing magazine capacity, speeding up
reloading and reducing recoil. These modifications are well within the
range of most shotgun owner's capabilities and budgets. And because
shotguns have not caught the eye of gun grabbers, you don't have to worry
about your shotgun being confiscated or outlawed as do owners of handguns
and combat-style rifles.

THE GATLING GUN - 19th Century Machine Gun to 21st Century Vulcan,
by Joseph Berk.
When it was introduced in 1862, the Gatling gun was so far ahead of its
time the U.S. military didn't even know how to make use of such a powerful,
high-rate-of-fire, multibarrel gun. But today, more than 130 years later,
the Gatling is still a force to be reckoned with. After being declared
obsolete in 1911, it staged an impressive comeback as the Vulcan in the
1950's, terrified the Vietcong in the jungles of Vietnam and contributed to
the swift defeat of Iraqi troops in the liberation of Kuwait. With modern
applications ranging from air defense to saturation fire to antitank gun
systems and even portable infantry weapons, it will no doubt play a vital
military role well into the 21st century. Here is the fascinating ongoing
story of a truly timeless weapon, from its beginning during the Civil War
to its current role as a state-of-the-art modern combat weapon.

Heavy firepower. The mere words conjure up visions of a concentrated
barrage of explosive weaponry. Yet such destructive firepower need not come

heap, a wide variety of devastating weapons can be constructed for
defensive purposes.

This book features more than 20 extremely simple plans for devising bombs,
mines, grenades and even a shotgun mortar that can be used in a guerrilla
warfare situation or during other desperate times. From such ordinary items
as bottles, mousetraps, light bulbs, pipe, gravel and extension cord, a
determined defender can amass a fearsome array of antipersonnel and
antivehicle munitions that can be arranged in a most cunning and deadly
defense perimeter. Simple formulas for sugar- and fertilizer-based

RAGNAR'S BIG BOOK OF HOMEMADE WEAPONS - Building and Keeping Your Arsenal
Secure, by Ragnar Benson
Finally, under one cover, all the information you need to build, maintain
and deploy your own heavy weapons and explosives, as well as the skills to
protect them and you from nosy neighbors and potential enemies. This book
has all the nuts-and-bolts information from Ragnar's most popular books on
homemade C-4, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, high explosives,
mantrapping, weapons caching and gunrunning, plus ALL-NEW chapters on hand
and rifle grenades, claymore mines and mortars.

Many of these devices are now illegal, but just a few years ago, they
weren't. If you can no longer buy heavy weapons or explosives, you can
build your own using the easy-to-follow instructions, photographs and
illustrations contained in this highly controversial book. From one of
America's foremost authorities on improvised weapons and survival, this
collection of dangerous devices is designed as "emergency equipment" for
the dangerous times ahead - when riots and anarchy prevails. When police
can no longer provide personal protection, when guns are outlawed and only
outlaws have guns, the information in this book may come in handy.

MODERN WEAPONS CACHING, A Down-to-Earth Approach to Beating the Government
Gun Grab, by Ragnor Benson.
Never in America? Think again. In New Jersey, it has already happened. Like
something right out of Red Square, a law has passed requiring most owners
of semiautomatic weapons to give them up. The forces that would snatch away
our Second Amendment freedoms are gaining momentum, and the time to prepare
is now. Firearm owners must literally take their weapons underground - bury
them - or be prepared to have them confiscated. Ragnor Benson has spent
years refining weapons-caching strategy down to a science. Now, with the
need for such drastic measures looming ever larger on the horizon, he tells
you how to construct a foolproof cache guaranteed to weather the elements
for years, and where to place it in order to outwit the authorities and
beat their high-tech metal detectors. In the race against the firearms
roundup in the U.S., gun owners must follow Ragnor's example and look to
the future both with mistrust and a will to prevail.

                    Fireworks, Explosives & Demolitions

Prospectors, civil engineers, farmers, loggers and other workers may have
occasions to want to make their own explosives. Dynamite is the usual
ingredient but it may be hard to come by in remote areas, or to keep safely
on hand in hot weather and for indefinite time periods. The books in this
chapter teach you how to make your own explosives by using simple household
chemicals, and keep the ingredients in safe, separate containers until you
need them.

Instead of repeating the phrase "for information purposes only" on each
book and video listed in this catalog, ALL books and videos in this
Crimefighters' Catalog are FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

BEFORE you blast off, check with local law enforcement agents if fireworks
and explosives are permitted in your area, and what you need to do to avoid
legal problems if you make them and use them.

RAGNAR'S GUIDE TO HOME AND RECREATIONAL USE OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES, By Ragnar
Benson.
Who else but uncle Ragnar could write this down-home guide? Ice fishing
with dynamite, blowing stumps, mixing up sugar chlorate powder - the Benson
family was never the same after Ragnar discovered the fun to be had with
high explosives.

It's not all fun and games, though. Benson details techniques, materials,
hazards and safeguards, drawing on his many years of experience on the farm
and as a consultant all over the world. How to obtain commercial high
explosives, safely storing and transporting them, detonation techniques,
improvised explosives and more are woven in with the tales of Ragnar's

HOMEMADE C-4, A Closer Look
C-4 is by far the most desirable explosive, as those who've read Ragnar
Benson's best-selling book HOMEMADE C-4: A RECIPE FOR SURVIVAL know. More
powerful than dynamite or TNT, and used in frag grenades, claymore mines
and other weapons, C-4 quickly penetrates steel or armor, yet is extremely
stable - more so than dynamite!

FISTS, WITS, AND A WICKED RIGHT, Surviving on the Wild Side of the Street,
by Marc "Animal" MacYoung.
One thing this author doesn't pretend to be is a traditionalist. As he puts
it in this companion to his other very popular books, "It's awareness, or
wits, and fists that will keep you safe out there, not some fancy Oriental
fighting form."

The author focuses on the fine points and brutal technicalities of blows
and targeting - not just how to hit but WHERE to hit. Because the fact is,
the key to winning a fight is not necessarily to hit faster, or even
harder, but to do damage to the other guy before he can do it to you. On
the flip side, once you know what hurts, you'll know how to protect your
most vulnerable areas with a little more gusto. These are the critical
facts that will keep you alive and intact on the wild side of the street.

POOL CUES, BEER BOTTLES, AND BASEBALL BATS, Animal's Guide to Improvised
Weapons for Self-Defense, by Marc "Animal" MacYoung.
Would you admit to getting your ass kicked with a hairbrush? Animal would,
because he knows it can happen. In fact, any tool that aids and abets
knocking someone into next week can be considered a weapon - not just the
lethal stuff like guns and knives. This book will broaden your definition
of what constitutes a weapon to include rope, beer bottles, pens, pool
cues, cats, tables and chairs, keys, gin and tonics and a whole lot more.

Your martial arts training is not likely to protect you from a guy coming
at you with a tire iron or baseball bat, so you'd better know how to wing
it with whatever's close at hand. Here, Animal tells you how the basic
categories of weapons look, feel and act so you can keep from getting
creamed when somebody tries to use any object, in any way, to waste you.
Equipped with a new understanding of "weapons" and how they work, you'll be

Streetfighter, and Ambusher, by Peyton Quinn.
As a bouncer in a biker bar, having been attacked by fists, boots, pool
cues and knives, Peyton Quinn has learned a thing or two about what goes

STREET LETHAL, Unarmed Urban Combat, by Sammy Franco.
To survive a real streetfight, forget about those fancy leaping kicks and
pre-planned responses that you learned in the dojo - they simply won't work
in a real-life encounter. STREET LETHAL confronts this problem by both
outlining the principles for a realistic self-defense system and taking a
controversial look at the current state of martial arts in America.

Sammy Franco argues that traditional martial arts are locked into ancient
styles and forms and have lost their effectiveness as modern combat
systems. In response to this, he has founded Contemporary Fighting Arts, a
hard-hitting system that goes to the heart of a STREETFIGHTING situation
and ends it quickly. This book is a thought-provoking manual on unarmed
combat that every serious martial artist should read.

KILLER INSTINCT, Unarmed Urban Combat for Street Survival, by Sammy Franco.
On the streets of America (and elsewhere) there is no bushido, the
honorable code of the ancient warrior. Today's serious martial artist must
be prepared to neutralize vicious animals by being totally unrestricted by
rigid rules of combat etiquette. The Marquis of Queensbury rules are for
the ring, not in back alleys. Ditto for traditional martial arts taught for
tournaments: they need to be modified for streetfighters.

The author's attitude and concept of being street lethal is, when success
and failure can mean the difference between life and death, traditional
tools, stances, techniques and training methods must be MODIFIED to conform
to reality. In this book, Franco describes the mental, spiritual and
physical components of Contemporary Fighting Arts. This advanced system of
unarmed combat teaches you a brutal, efficient arsenal of techniques from a
variety of fighting forms. It equips you with the animal instinct necessary
to survive in a nation where drug wars, brutal homicides, assaults and rape
are tragic realities of everyday life.

really would have went down had it been a real-life situation. Discover the

your face," squaring off and how critical it is to be aware of what is
going on around you when you enter an unfamiliar bar.

Jerry Beasley, Ed.D.
Experience the power of Bruce Lee's jeet kune do, the explosive martial art
drawn from the best of Eastern and Western fighting styles. Bruce Lee

principles and techniques and an introduction to the next generation of

THE WAY OF NO WAY, Solving the Jeet Kune Do Riddle, by Jerry Beasley, Ed.D.
"What the Hell is JKD?" The editor who posed this question was probably not
the first - nor the last - to do so. How do you pin down an art whose
founder, Bruce Lee, said had "no boundaries" and referred to as the "way of
no way"? When Bruce Lee died, he left behind a legacy, but he also left
mysteries, riddles and puzzles.

In this book the author, a martial arts scholar who trained extensively
with JKD champion Joe Lewis, takes a logical, down-to-earth approach to
sorting the pieces and solving the puzzle. In the book, you'll discover
that JKD is not simply a matter of joining a JKD organization, or studying
the art with a JKD instructor. It is the freedom to react, the knowledge to
respond and the ability to discover. Beasley's insightful research, in-
depth discussions with Dan Inosanto and exclusive photos of training
sessions with Lewis will lead you to a greater understanding of the
emerging art and practice of Jeet Kune Do.

GUGE GONGJI, Seven Primary Targets to Take Anyone Out of a Fight, by Master
Hei Long.
Structurally disabling an opponent is like removing the bullets from a gun.
It's unlikely that an opponent can throw a punch at you with a broken wrist
or elbow, and his ability to advance is substantially inhibited by a busted
knee or ankle. That's the principle of guge gongji: stopping an attacker by
breaking his instruments of danger. In unarmed combat, that means his
ability to move or strike.

Guge gongji is an alternative to killing, a second-to-last resort that
should be used only when conventional self-defense tactics are likely to be
ineffective. Master Hei Long's precise instructions and illustrations show
you how to use your opponent's body as YOUR weapon! Learn the seven primary
targets guaranteed to take ANYONE out of a fight.

GOUZAO GONGJI, Seven Neurological Attacks for Inflicting Serious Damage,
by Master Hei Long.
In this groundbreaking study, the author unveils the secrets of Gouzoa
Gongji, a (really) no-holds barred system of self-defense consisting of
seven anatomical targets which, when attacked strategically, will
effectively cripple an assailant's nervous system. The Master pinpoints
these primary targets and reveals how a properly delivered blow can bring
about the desired effect, be it disrupted balance, acute pain,
unconsciousness or a temporarily paralyzed limb. Then he outlines which
strikes and angles of force are the most effective for achieving the
precise results you are after. These targets are not lethal or even
critical - but not every confrontation calls for such severe action or
warrants such devastating consequences. Instead, these seven targets offer
a comfortable middle-ground option, arming you with tools to inflict damage
serious enough to stop an assailant of comparable size, strength and weight
in his tracks. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, illust., 168 pp, $16 (GOUZAO)(2010)

Touch! Learn how you can immobilize or destroy your foe with high-impact
blows to his most vulnerable areas. Master Hei Long explains which pressure
points are the most susceptible to Dragon strikes and which angles you
should use in applying force. The body's 43 major target areas are
explicitly illustrated, and 165 photographs show you how to attack each
pressure point with the self-defense moves of Lian Shi kung fu.

The body's weaknesses and physiological reactions can work in your favor in
a combat situation. Sufficient force to specific target areas can cause
pain, shock, paralysis, unconsciousness, even death. Each deadly set of
movements can ensure that you are in control. Be the survivor - not a
victim.  5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, illustr., 184 pp, $10 (DRAG)(398)

techniques that will get the job done quickly and efficiently.

self-defense. The author teaches the primary targets of an opponent's body
and points out how to recognize various physical characteristics that would
limit the lethal effectiveness of certain techniques. He then outlines the
merciless use of the hands, feet, elbows and knees to overcome any
assailant who is trying to kill you.

Whether fighting on the battlefield, in an elevator, back alley or on the
streets, MASTER'S DEATH TOUCH takes self-defense to its most brutal level.

21 TECHNIQUES OF SILENT KILLING, by Master Hei Long.
Assassination using manual weapons rather than firearms is a deadly skill
that few possess. The assassin must locate his target, get close enough to
neutralize him with a single stroke, and escape without being captured. To
be successful, the job has to be done quickly and silently, attracting as
little attention as possible while guaranteeing the death of the target.

This highly controversial and informative book outlines methods used by
trained assassins to execute their victims with cold efficiency. The spike,
knife and nunchaku are used to impale or strangle victims in a minimum
amount of time with a maximum chance for lethal results. These are ruthless
methods used in the shadowy world of criminal activity and international
espionage. This book holds nothing back! (In fact, the illustrations in
this book are so gruesome the regular printer refused to handle the job!)

The techniques in this book are not self-defense maneuvers, nor is it a
training manual. What you can LEARN from it is what to look out for, and
how to protect yourself from such attacks by fanatical zealots or paid
assassins! If you're a lawman or CrimeFighter involved in fighting
terrorists, you NEED to know what assassins know - and a little bit more!

MASTER'S GUIDE TO BASIC SELF-DEFENSE, Progressive Retraining of the
Reflexive Response, by Master Hei Long.
At least once in his life, every man will stand face-to-face with an
aggressor. In that moment of truth, he must be prepared to defend himself -
to the death is necessary. Despite common self-defense myths, there is no
deeply mysterious method by which you can touch an opponent in a strategic
spot and bring him to his knees.

The CORE of any system of self-defense is the RESPONSE to an attack. But
certain natural responses (such as ducking and blinking) often leave you
exposed and defenseless for just a moment or two - which is all the time
needed to finish you off. In an unexpected attack, none of your martial
arts training is going to help you if these reflexes are allowed to take
over.

Master Hei Long's training program focuses on DECONDITIONING such
counterproductive responses to an assault. Through a structured learning
process that combines fundamental defensive maneuvers with the retraining
of the central nervous system, you will learn how to instinctively avoid
ducking and blinking during common assaults and counterattack with maximum
efficiency and ferocity to deftly and swiftly defeat your attackers.

SUDDEN VIOLENCE, The Art of San Soo, by Master Greg Jones.
There is one big difference between street fighting and tournament fighting
- in a street fight, if you miss with a dramatic whirling kick, a referee
won't step in to save you from a death dealing blow in return. The
developers of kung fu san soo know this all too well. That's why this
martial art bypasses formal dojo techniques and gets down to the bone-
breaking, eye-gouging, rib-crushing basics that will keep you alive on the
violence-prone city streets.

This manual teaches simple but unique self-defense principles that you can
learn to use to stop an attack BEFORE IT'S BEGUN. Through the "five
families" of this little-known style of kung fu, you will learn how to
recognize a threat and use deadly efficient strikes to put the bad gus away
every time. Your opponent may be tough, but as a san soo martial artist,
YOU WILL NEVER GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO PROVE IT!

protection has had no one to teach him or the need to learn the way of the
warrior - until now. It isn't a fighting skill - it's a state of mind; an
essential ingredient for those who must fight for survival like a warrior!

BLACK MEDICINE II, Weapons at Hand, by N. Mashiro, Ph.D.
Here is the sequel to N. Mashiro's infamous Black Medicine I, The Dark Art
of Death. That book reveals the 150 parts of the human body most vulnerable
in hand-to-hand combat. This book, Weapons at hand, takes the opposite
approach, presenting 112 parts of the body that are natural weapons,
largely because they are very injury-resistant. Following this is a section
radically different from conventional self-defense theory, which lists more
than 180 deadly makeshift weapons that can save your life. The weapons are
all improvised from common items. And 50 action photos show exactly how to
use the "black medicine" techniques discussed in "Weapons at Hand." This
volume is especially suited to the needs of bodyguards, security personnel
and martial artists, and anyone else who feels they have a need to defend
themselves or targets of deadly, unprovoked attacks.

BLACK MEDICINE III, Low Blows, by N. Mashiro, Ph.D.
Long awaited by self-defense specialists around the world, this book is the
third volume in the author's infamous "Black Medicine" series. In LOW BLOWS
Mashiro presents his favorite techniques for bringing the body's natural
weapons into violent and painful contact with an opponent's vulnerable
areas. He teaches devastating responses to wrist holds, punches, chokes,
rear attacks, bear hugs and special defenses against knife and club
attackers. Especially noteworthy is a chapter on fighting a standing
opponent from the ground! If you get into fights, sooner or later you'll be
on the ground. (You can bet on it.) Learning and using this trick alone may
turn the tables - and quite possibly save your life!

Over one hundred dramatic photos illustrate the holds and moves in LOW
BLOWS, making it substantially longer than previous volumes in this series.
An excellent self-study guide for beginners and an eye-opening reference
work for advanced students and instructors. But be warned: LOW BLOWS is not
for readers with weak stomachs.

                           Martial Arts Weapons

CHINESE RING DAGGERS, The Ultimate Close-Quarter Weapons, by Ricky Pickins.
A rare, exotic weapon, the Chinese ring dagger has a ring situated where a
pommel normally would be. This arrangement allows you, with your index

punches. Or, use the dagger singly or in pairs, one in each hand to double
your slashing power.

Hundreds of photos illustrate the stances, moves and kata that make this
such a beautiful and exotic, albeit deadly, martial art form. Take
advantage of this first-ever revealing book of this ancient Chinese art
that uses the ultimate close-quarter weapon.

PANANANDATA YANTOK AT DAGA, Filipino Stick and Dagger, by Amante P. Marinas
You don't have to live in the Philippines to use this very practical and
efficient self-defense system of using a stick and dagger. Why use both the
stick and dagger? When you're attacked with a long weapon, the stick is
used to block and thrust THROUGH your attacker's defenses; the dagger is
used once you have bypassed his defenses. If your assailant has only a
short weapon, the stick easily defeats it, opening an avenue for a slash or
thrust with either the stick or dagger.

Visualize yourself going for a peaceful walk in the park or lonely streets.
You always take with you a walking stick (perhaps a sword cane, or if it's
rainy weather, an English style umbrella with a sharp 4" point) and your
trusty hunting knife which is easily accessible. Suddenly, you're
confronted with a robber who shows a knife as a threat. Imagine the thugs
surprise when you pull your knife and, using your walking stick (sword cane
or sharp umbrella), attack him! If you know how to use a stout stick and
sharp dagger, the ordinary robber won't have a chance of a snowball in hell
- where you can send him if need be. This book, with its 188 photos, can
teach you HOW to use both the stick and dagger with deadly efficiency.

If you live in a State that has highly restrictive gun laws, this may be
the only legal way to carry self-defense weapons. If you own a hunting
knife (and you should) and take a walking stick with you when you go for
walks, and know how to use them effectively, you'll never be unarmed and
defenseless! 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, 188 photos, 104 pp, $12 (YAN)(692)

power of TKD strikes to shatter bricks or boards - or bust an assailant's
bones in a street fight. As you watch the action, the full-power
demonstrations on specially armored attackers, you will understand the
combat applications of moves "within" the forms that are so often
misunderstood or missed altogether by many TKD students. This complete
instructional video will open your eyes to the necessity of practicing TKD
forms if you want to maximize your real-life self-defense training.

SNAP. For most people the click of a switchblade knife is an ominous sound.

know the value of a good one-handed knife.

is hard to come by. This book tells you everything you need to know: types

When a video on knife defense opens up with the narrator showing his scars
from knife attacks, you KNOW the information in it comes from firsthand
experience. And the narrator - Peyton Quinn, author of the tremendously
popular book "A Bouncer's Guide to Barroom Brawling" - has plenty of that
too. Unlike the majority of self-defense instructors, Quinn has actually
been assaulted with knives, yet he successfully defended himself each time.
In this extraordinary video, he explains the reality of knife attacks and
explicitly shows how he prevailed. Quinn says, "If I had to rely on my dojo
training alone, I'd likely be dead now."

                        City & Wilderness Survival

STREET-SMART SURVIVAL, A Nineties Guide to Staying Alive and Living Well,
by Victor Santoro.
With the Cold War behind us, the old survivalist formula of "grab the
groceries and run for the hills" has become virtually obsolete. But today's
home-grown threats can be just as deadly. And those that don't threaten
your life may threaten your lifestyle. In telling you how to cope with
today's problems, Victor Santoro identifies the high-grade threats such as
war, epidemics, terrorism, street crime and even institutions, as well as
low-grade threats such as economic recessions, service strikes, lawsuits,
medical malpractice and various invasions of privacy. Then he takes a look
at real-life scenarios and presents down-to-earth solutions. Included are
checklists, exercises and calculations designed to prepare you for any kind
of a threatening situation. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, 168 pp, $15 (SSS)(992)

                              BENSON'S BOOKS

THE SURVIVAL RETREAT - A Total Plan for Retreat Defense, by Ragnar Benson.
A fresh approach to retreat defense - the concealed, low-profile survival
retreat is aimed at "winning battles by avoiding them."

Survivalist Benson is noted for his practical perspective; here he tells
you how to harden the city or country refuge against the perils of nuclear
attack. (In spite of the end of the Cold War, there's still thousands of
nukes around the world, some in the hands of dictators!) If no nuke attack,
there's plenty of close-to-home dangers, as well as just plain economic
collapse. In any event, survivalists should plan ahead, locate a retreat
area and keep it hidden as much as possible. This is not another grab-a-
gun-and-shoot-back book. It's a book on planned, prepared survival.

"A retreat is a place you go to live, not to die. Setting up a retreat is,
for the most part, practicing the art of the possible. It's a matter of
wisely and shrewdly identifying what you have available and turning it into
something usable," writes Benson. "Fight if you must, but try to
orchestrate events so that confrontation is absolutely the remedy of last
resort."

Chapters include: Why Retreat?, Retreat Location, Who is the Enemy?, The
Psychology of Defense, Beyond Firepower, What If It Come To a Fight?, and
Making it Difficult.

with forty years of poaching experience behind him. He tells you how to get
a deer any time you go hunting for one and how to live off the land,
whether in the city or country. He also gives plans for ingenious,
effective traps, snares and deadfalls; plans for permanent, concealed traps
for small game and fish; lessons on woodcraft and scouting; information on
equipment, firearms selection, ammo choices, and lots more.

drawings, such mantraps as the Malaysian Hawk, The Andes Mountain Trail
Trap, the Sheepeater's Rock Fall, and the Cuba Water Trap are covered. As
Benson says: "To know how to trap your enemy is to know how to avoid being
trapped yourself." Each trap is constructed with primitive materials and

SURVIVALIST'S MEDICINE CHEST, by Ragnar Benson
Here's a truly practical guide about using specialized medicines in a world
without doctors. This book was written ESPECIALLY FOR SURVIVALISTS! It
covers pneumonia, VD, plague and diarrhea - which are killers without
modern drugs, but they can be beat with a little preparation and know-how.

From his years helping Third World natives with vet medicines, survivalist
author Ragnar Benson brings you this handbook for doctoring humans with
readily obtainable veterinary medicines. In many cases, vet medicines are
identical to those M.D.s recommend, but at a fraction of the cost. They can
be bought WITHOUT prescriptions and safely stored until an emergency
demands their use.

Tetanus, typhoid, and gun wound infections will never again strike fear in
the hearts of survivalists who have this book. With this well illustrated
handbook and your supply of antibiotics, syringes, sulfa drugs, sewing
needles and sutures, you'll be able to protect anyone from the illnesses
that would otherwise prove fatal without modern medicine.

BIRTH CERTIFICATE FRAUD
In today's credential-crazy society, the birth certificate is the
foundation of a person's identity on paper, but this all-important document
is also susceptible to falsification.

Birth certificate fraud takes many forms: stealing, transferring or selling
valid certificates; counterfeiting, selling or using bogus or altered
documents; or using someone else's valid certificate by impersonating the
owner. This report, from the Inspector General of Health and Human
Services, examines the weaknesses of issuing procedures, the effects of the
poor inter-agency cooperation, the vulnerability of the forms themselves to
falsification, the value of protective measures such as matching birth and
death records and the variety of effective tactics used by agencies to
combat fraud. Find out how the government intends to crack down on the
growing criminal enterprise in fraudulent birth certificates.

called deals? This book tells you how. By reading the stories in this book
-- some shocking, some amusing -- find out the COMMON THREADS that run

it, to pull them off - have happened to someone. Now you can see to it that
they don't happen to you. 5.5 X 8.5, hardcover, 200 pp, $17 (MONEY)(594)

ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER SYSTEMS FRAUD
It can happen to you - your entire bank account drained by the latest
nonviolent criminal to hit the streets. That faceless person behind you at
the Automatic Teller Machine could actually be seeking clues to gain access

such high-tech theft, it's a major hassle trying to straighten out the
resulting mess with the bank.

This manual is the first in-depth look at this growing crime wave. The
nature and extent of electronic banking fraud is examined, including scores
of actual incidents involving lost or stolen ATM cards and wire transfer

The ability to open locks without keys is no longer monopolized by
locksmiths who jealously guard their secrets. The pick gun has taken the
art of lock picking away from a select few and facilitated the ability for

they work and how to use them - and traces the development of the pick gun
from its early stages to its final state-of-the-art. Included are the
original patents by Epstein, Segal, Moore, Cook and others, as well as info
on pick guns used by the FBI and intelligence agencies. Photos show

CIA FIELD-EXPEDIENT KEY CASTING MANUAL
How does the CIA agent get behind locked doors? One way is by casting a
duplicate key from an original. Lock picks are equally as good, but take a
few seconds longer, and it's more than embarrassing if someone sees you
"picking" a lock. When you can obtain a key, it's a lot easier and makes it
appear you have the legal right to entry. This manual tells you how to make
a duplicate when you can keep the original for just a short period of time.

(That's why you should remove all keys except the car key when leaving a
vehicle with a parking-lot attendant or garage!  Inside your car is the
vehicle registration or other papers with your address. With a key to your
front door or office, it's like an open invitation to burglars.)

This step-by-step, self-checking guide takes you through the process of
preparing the casting mold, making the key impression, and casting a key
model, using a standard-issue or improvised clay-filled casting mold, low-
melting point casting metal and other readily available materials.

This straightforward text and clear instructions of this updated manual
give you the knowledge you need to create accurate keys to gain access to
off-limits areas without special equipment.

BY WAY OF DECEPTION, by Victor Ostrovsky & Clair Hoy
This book describes the shocking scope and depth of the Mossad's influence,
disclosing how Jewish communities in the U.S., Europe, and South America
are armed and trained by the organizations in secret "self defense" units,
and how Mossad agents facilitate the drug trade in order to pay the
enormous costs of its far-flung, clandestine operation. And it portrays a
network that has grown dangerously out of control, as internal squabbles
have led to the escape of terrorists and the pursuit of "policies"
completely at odds with the interests of the State of Israel.

In chilling detail, Ostrovsky asserts that the Mossad refused to share
critical knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, leading to the
death of hundreds of U.S. Marines and French troops. He tells how they
tracked Yasser Arafat by recruiting his driver and bodyguard; how they
withheld information on the whereabouts of American hostages, paving the
way for the Iran-Contra scandal; and how their intervention into secret
U.N. negotiations led to the sudden resignation of Ambassador Andrew Young
and the downfall of his career.

This book is the explosive chronicle of the author's experiences in the
Mossad, and of two decades of their frightening and often ruthless covert
activities around the world. Penetrating far deeper than "Every Spy a
Prince" it is an insider's account of Mossad tactics and exploits.

Victor Ostrovsky became disenchanted with the Mossad and resigned. This
book tells you why; about the Mossad's greed for power, lust, and total
lack of respect for human life. It also tells about the Mossad's
assassination teams, how they operate, the weapons and tactics they use. If
you wanted the real facts and details of the Mossad, this book tells all.

THE GOOD BOOZE RECIPE AND COOKBOOK, by James C. Krohn, Ph.D.
Have you ever REALLY had good booze? Not that commercial stuff, mass-
produced and full of preservatives, but liquor that's been carefully
distilled by a booze connoisseur, right in his own home? There's no equal
comparison. The personal attention and quality ingredients makes this
"shine" one of the smoothest drinks you've ever tasted. It's easy to make,
and costs considerably less because there's no exorbitant taxes to pay!

Author Jim Krohn has been making booze for years, and he lays it all out
for you: how to set up a still, the equipment you'll need, the time
involved and the techniques to produce your own clear sugar alky. This is
the stuff you can flavor and then "cut" to create whatever potion you
prefer. Make gin, bourbon, vodka, scotch, or orange or coffee-flavored
liqueurs. Krohn includes a helpful appendix of equipment and supplies and
offers advice on how to mix great drinks with your good booze.
(The "cooking" part in the title is in the distillation of the alky.)

                         Almost Free Legal Advice
                       and Do-It-Yourself Legal Kits

Anyone who can read this CrimeFighter catalog can prepare standard-form
legal documents when they take the time to read the simple, but detailed,
step-by-step instructions and use samples as a guide to fill in the blank
forms. That's the idea of do-it-yourself Kits. There are "dozens" of such
Kits -- for all kinds of common, everyday legal documents. Incorporation
Kits are the most popular, but there are many others also available.
Ten such Kits are mentioned below for your thoughtful consideration.

You realize, I'm sure, lawyers don't do the clerical work. They have their
secretaries use their word processors to plug in names and addresses on the
multitude of forms they have in their data bank. What you are really paying
for is a lawyer's legal advice. That may be worth $100 to $200, if you feel
you need legal advice.

A smarter option is to get your legal advice separately -- for $10 to $20!
Then get a do-it-yourself Kit for about $30. Fill in your own name and
addresses on standard-wording forms that are used by legal secretaries and
paralegals.
                 Almost Free Legal Advice - If you Need it

Local Bar Associations in every city in North America (Canada included),
has a special deal for you: a half hour of a lawyer's time for a maximum
fee of just $10 to $20. The charge is minimal to discourage free-loading,
but affordable to encourage you to make appointments. The cost varies from
city to city and depends on the local economy and affluence of the region.

The deal is an introductory offer. It's to encourage you to talk to a
lawyer to discuss your problem; to evaluate the lawyer before you commit
yourself to (perhaps) thousands of dollars of work; and for the lawyer to
assess your problem and suggest a solution and his fee for same. If you're
satisfied with the interview and decide to retain the lawyer, you know what
it will cost and can start the work by paying a retainer up front.

On the other hand, you aren't committed if you decide to talk to another
lawyer for another opinion and price. That lets you shop for a lawyer you
feel comfortable with in regards to personality, attitude, rates, etc. As a
business person, that's always a smart idea: to shop for the best deal.

For most common legal documents, the lawyer provides routine information
called "advice": and the secretary does the work! You usually don't need a
high-priced lawyer to type your name and address on simple, standard legal
forms. In fact, paralegals in most states do the same thing at a fraction
of the cost of a lawyer-prepared documents. However, in some states and
Provinces, paralegals are severely restricted in providing services to the
public. (Guess who made those laws!)

The bottom line is, if all you have is a simple question or two, and the
answers are a yes or no, or standard information relevant to the documents,
all it costs is $10 or $20 maximum.  There's no need to visit a lawyer at
standard rates of $125 to $175 an hour just to ask the "routine" questions.

Use the Bar Association referral service. It's listed in the Yellow Pages
of your phone directory under LAWYERS or ATTORNEYS. Call them, get the name
of a lawyer who specializes or has experience in the services you need.

Call the lawyer, tell him the Bar Association gave you his name. (That puts
him on notice he can't (shouldn't) charge more than the Bar Association has
promised you. It entitles you to no more than half an hour of the lawyer's
time in answering questions. It does not include any work that entails
research or preparation of documents. It's mainly to give you personal and
legal advice about your problem, and to quote a fee for doing the work.

The best deal for intelligent people is to obtain legal advice separately
via this special deal from Bar Associations (when you feel you need it).
Use a well-prepared Kit and do your own work and save hundreds of dollars.

Said Kits have samples of filled-in forms; preprinted forms with blank
spaces for names and addresses, etc.; and instructions for each step (plus
relevant comments that, if given verbally in their office, is called legal
advice and will cost you about $200; and a set of preprinted forms with
blank spaces where you fill in the blanks with your own names, addresses,
dates, and other relevant information.

I've found a legal publisher who has authored NINE different Kits. The
publisher has been in business since 1976 -- plenty of time to make them
perfect as they can be from feedback from tens of thousands of satisfied
users. Besides being the most complete Kits I've seen (and I've used dozens
of such Kits during the last 30 years) the author provides a TOLL FREE HELP
LINE which can be used to ask any question regarding any of the Kits he has
prepared. (That doesn't mean "legal advice", so don't ask for it.)

The Kits are designed for legal use in all 50 States. The instruction
manual that comes with with each Kit mentions any difference in law and the
state's requirements -- if they are different from the standard forms.

Instead of listing each and every form in all of the different Kits, I'll
just say these Kits are complete in every detail, well-prepared and
suitable for anyone who can read and follow simple instructions. As a
bonus, you'll learn about the law and how to do-it-yourself from then on,
for the rest of your life. That can save you thousands of dollars.

                                 The Kits

(1) The Non-Profit Corporation Kit provides all of the Forms required to
incorporate a Non-Profit Organization as either a Membership or Non-
Membership Corporation, or as a private Foundation.

A booklet that comes with it contains an Instruction Guide plus samples of
filled-in forms. A separate package in the Kit contains preprinted forms
for all occasions with blank spaces for names and addresses etc.
(Recommended for incorporating CrimeFighters lodges.)
Kit # 1, Non-Profit Kit, $29.95


(2) The Corporation Kit is prepared for American small business
corporations. (Recommended for a Crimefighters' Private Investigation
business to limit liability from lawsuits, bankruptcy, and to provide many
fringe benefits of being an "employee" of your corporation.
Kit # 2, Business Incorp. $26.95


(3) The Living Trust Kit is a low-cost option to the many lawyer sponsored
seminars that feed you just enough information to encourage you to use a
Living Trust and sell their services at $1,000 or more to do it for you.
By comparison, the booklet takes the place of the seminars (and is printed
for future reference). The preprinted forms and samples takes the place of
a lawyer's secretary. With this Kit, you can do it yourself for just $15!

The Kit includes a Will for the many things that may not be included in the
list of assets. (A lawsuit award for wrongful death from an accident (for
negligence), for example, paid to your estate after your death is not in
the living trust.)

The A-B Trust (Above and Below ground) is a revocable trust while you are
alive and in charge, and automatically legally transfers title of your
assets to the person(s) named in the trust when you die.

The main purpose of a Trust is to avoid Probate fees and inheritance taxes,
but it also provides a guaranteed legal disposal of your assets to the
people you want. The Trust is outside of a Will. It avoids legal battles
over Wills by disgruntled heirs. Greedy lawyers often milk an estate dry
before they "settle" the estate. Living Trusts can avoid that problem.

If you are divorced or separated from your spouse, and have children, a
Living Trust is essential.  If you have no Will or Trust, disposition of
your estate is in the hands of the court. In most cases, your estate will
be passed to your legal spouse, not the person whom you may want to have
it. If you have just a Will, it will be probated in court. First, lawyers
will dip into the estate for Probate and other fees. The judge may decide
to ignore the wishes of the deceased and give certain assets to whom he
believes deserves it. If you were alive you might disagree. When you're
dead, you can't do anything about it.

Beat them to the draw! A living trust lets you control your assets while
alive, and positively transfers ownership to the persons named in the
trust when you die. You, not lawyers or judges, are in Control when you
have a Living Trust.  Kit # 3, Living Trust  $14.95.


(4) A Living Will Kit is the companion to a Living Trust. A Living Will is
needed when you are permanently injured and can't care for yourself. It
allows you to designate someone to take care of you and your assets when
you can no longer make the decisions or pay the bills. The Kit has forms
with provisions for requesting the withholding of specific life support
procedures that may unnecessarily prolong your life and discomfort for
yourself and loved ones.  Kit # 4, Living Will  $7.95.


(5) A Regular Will Kit. If you don't need or want a Living Trust (that
includes a Will) this Kit is a no-frills do-it-yourself Will Kit. The
booklet with detailed explanations is worth $13.
Kit # 5, Simple Will  $12.95


(6) Partnership Agreements for a business that isn't incorporated. In a few
cases, a legal partnership may provide some advantages over a corporate
entity. The smaller cost (no state incorporating fees or annual reporting
fees) is a consideration, but a minor one. There are also many drawbacks to
Partnerships which are to numerous to mention in this book. Before you form
a legal business partnership, be sure to compare the pros and cons of each
type of business organization. If you decide a legal partnership is the
best for you, here's a Kit that can save you a few hundred dollars in legal
fees.  Kit # 6, Business Partnership  $19.95


(7) Pre-Marriage Agreements are standard fare for rich people. If you're a
person lucky enough to have a small fortune tucked away or invested, there
are lots of people who marry for money only. You may be a target. This may
be O.K. if you're aware of it, but it could be a disaster if your spouse
of a few months were to sue for divorce and then ask for a huge alimony or
cash settlement far out of proportion to the benefits of a short honeymoon.
That's where pre-marriage agreements come in. They avoid that problem.

Pre-Marriage Agreements usually stipulate that all assets that belong to
each spouse before marriage belongs to the original owners after divorce
(or death) and are not "joint property" because of marriage as it might be
considered in many states. Having such an agreement may save your marriage
as well as your money. With pre-marriage agreements, gold-diggers aren't
interested, or are diverted to suckers who don't insist on such agreements.
Kit # 7, Pre-Marriage Agreement  $12.95


(8) Bankruptcy Kits are the last resort in a financial crisis. Bankruptcy
is when your debts exceed your assets and ability to pay all your debtors.
In some cases, debtors my force bankruptcy on you. In other situations, you
may decide to declare bankruptcy to get your debtors off your back; to
start all over again with a clean sheet and no debtors.

There are many books on bankruptcy that provide detailed instructions and
some have tear-out forms. The problem with books of this nature is, they're
often out of date and include obsolete forms and other information.

The Bankruptcy Kits by this legal publisher have the same information as
some books, but is guaranteed to be up to date in all aspects. There are
samples of filled-in forms and all the preprinted forms you need to do-it-
yourself. Just fill in the blank spaces with personal information and file
the papers yourself. That can save you about $200 in legal fees.

Kit # 8 Bankruptcy under Chapter 7  (Wipes out personal debts)  $27.95

Kit # 9 Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 has a monthly payment plan to stop
foreclosures, garnishments, repossession and trustee sales with a court-
approved monthly payment schedule  $27.95


(10) A Do-It-Yourself Litigation Kit.  This one is under development by
CFI. It should be ready for delivery by Jan '94. Details are in CRIMFTR1
FloppyBook. Prepublication price is $20. After publication price will be
$29.95. Order now, and save $10.

If you're not an ex-cop, the following inexpensive pocketbooks provide a
tremendous amount of insider information. Reading these books will help to
bridge the gap between novice CrimeFighters and experienced cops.

Of course, no matter how many books you read it won't make you the equal of
an experienced cop!  But, these books (among others in this catalog) will
give you valuable insight on police work in general. That's the first step
- to understand cops, what they do, and how they go about it. If you're
going to be an active CrimeFighter, (indirectly) working with cops, you
need to know all you can what it's like being "on the job". And even if you
don't plan on being an active CrimeFighter, it's still worth while to read
a few of these books to learn what a cop's job is like.

These specially selected books reveal an enormous amount of regular and
irregular police procedure. They contain TRUE stories of hundreds of
investigations. By reading them you can learn a few things - like what to
do and what not to do. If you've led a sheltered life, you'll learn street
language, ghetto slang, and narcotics terminology. Besides being exciting
and fascinating reading, they are excellent Crimefighters' educational
material. If you plan on being an active Crimefighter, read all of them.

An important thing you'll learn is that cops are ordinary human beings, not
supermen or superwomen. The following books lets you take a peek at a cop's
emotions that the public seldom sees. You'll learn that they can cry, and
are scared at times, just like anyone else. But they're trained to do their
job no matter how they feel about it. When you get inside their heads (by
reading their books) you'll understand that YOU are no different from them
- except for the training and dedication. You too, can do police work. Not
everyone can qualify to be a cop, but everyone can be a CrimeFighter!

From the back cover:

           "THEY SEE WHAT WE DON'T SEE. AND THEY PAY THE PRICE.

Cops know how innocent kids get killed by gangs because of an accidental

like without its head or arms.

see next. There's no worst - it does amaze me what people do to other
people."

and work among misfits, junkies, prostitutes, killers, psychopaths, and
victims in luxury neighborhoods and on the meanest turf. From law enforce-

about sex crimes, child abuse, drug dealing, con schemes - the incredible
things they see and deal with every day of the year, every year on the job.

THE MAKING OF A COP, by Harvey Rachlin, (1991)

From the back cover:

"The making of a Cop is an accurate account of the rigorous discipline and
intensive instruction in the police academy and of how that teaching
changes the lives of the young men and women who will soon be out there on
the streets."  Mark Baker, author of Cops.

Who are the men and women of the New York City Police Academy? What does it
take to survive this unforgiving urban boot camp and emerge a rookie, ready
for a beat on some of the meanest streets in the nation?

To find out, journalist Harvey Rachlin followed four raw recruits from the
Academy to the streets. His dramatic day by day account, THE MAKING OF A
COP, thrusts us into a world of age-old traditions and sudden-death
decisions.

From the intricacies of criminal law to the blazing of .38's on the firing
range, we watch new recruits slowly shed their innocence and open their
eyes to a new and perilous world of perpetrators, lowlifes, search and
seizure, combat reloading. We pound a rookie beat with them - subduing a
crack-crazed mugger, battling the legal machinery to preserve a "good"
bust. We see them absorb the knowledge which may one day save our lives -
or their own.

Taking us through the rigors, the grueling decisions and gut wrenching
fear, THE MAKING OF A COP is a compelling portrait of a group of men and
women striving to become the finest in blue - in a city always alive with
danger and decency, despair and hope.

a supremely difficult job" - Publishers Weekly.     (MAKING)(5003) $5

THE MOON IS ALWAYS FULL, and
BLACK FRIDAY COMING DOWN, by David Hunter, (1990)

Both books by the same author tell true stories of moments of panic, fear,
hilarious situations, cop's cynicism, and the satisfaction of a cop's job.
The first book THE MOON IS ALWAYS FULL talks about the nut cases who "come
out of hiding when the moon is full". To a cop, the moon is ALWAYS full.

TRUE BLUE, by Ed Nowicki, 1992

"The book that's become an underground legend among cops. True stories
about real cops. No punches pulled. No apologies made. Ed Nowicki has
captured the heart and soul of Police work." Lt. Ernest A Spiotto, Chicago
Police Department.        From the back cover:

Cops dare to tell it like it is...
"Stan approached the driver's door with his ever-present, friendly smile.
The smile was promptly destroyed by a shot fired from a .357 magnum
directly in his mouth. Jack screamed through the car's radio microphone,
'10-1, officer shot. Officer needs help.' Mixed emotions of frustration,
anger, hatred, sorrow, and pity overwhelmed him as he helplessly watched
his partner's life fading away."

They risk it all on streets that have become war zones...
"Ken ran into the street to help the screaming boy who was trapped under
the left side of the Chevy van that was balanced on the curb. It was
teetering slightly, and could come down on the boy at any moment. He had
almost reached the boy when he heard the sound of an engine, and the Chevy
began to rock."

Where a split-second decision can make the difference between an official
commendation and a hero's funeral...
"Two shots rang out and Ted felt something hit the back of his left
shoulder. Adrenaline was now surging through his body. He knew he had been
shot, and he knew he was going to take care of this punk. As he found the
ammo wallet, the Camero began taking off down the road again at a high rate
of speed. Ted carefully took aim and fired the last round from his Chief's
Special."

This is law enforcement as you've never seen it... and cops as they rarely
reveal themselves -- not always by-the-book, but always human."

From the back cover:

                 "DEATH. POWER. MONEY - THE COCAINE WARS.

It is the world's most valuable commodity. It is a business bigger than the
Ford Motor Company. It is cocaine, and a single, ruthless, savagely
sophisticated entity controls the empire: the Colombian Cartel. For two and
a half years, the authors lived on the front lines of this story, and they
provide an astonishing, disturbing inside look at the Cartel and its
operators: the millionaires and enforcers, the smugglers and informers.

THE COCAINE WARS takes us from the jungles of South America where the coca
is grown to the streets of Miami where drug money has corrupted at least
one in every ten cops. With unlimited wealth and power at stake, whole
governments can be bought and sold, and almost every man has his price.

THE COCAINE WARS is investigative reporting that reads like a crime
thriller but has the shocking impact of today's headlines. For the first
time, here is the full story of the traffic in cocaine, the story of the
war being waged - and lost - on the streets all across America."

TOP undercover cop. A man with a proven record of arrests - personally
accounting for more than 3,000 criminals serving 15,000 years in jail. A
man who now calls America's war on drugs "the biggest, costliest, most
dangerous failure of American policy since Vietnam.

He takes us with him on one of the most dramatic, ambitious cases ever
mounted - an operation in which the drug kingpins of three countries were
caught red-handed... and tells us why they were never brought to justice.
The result is THE explosive expose of why we're losing the war on drugs -
told in the words of an American who devoted his life to winning it."

From the back cover:

  "THE GRIPPING TRUE STORY OF A FEDERAL AGENT'S ONE-MAN WAR AGAINST DRUGS

For twenty-three years DEA agent Michael Levine has waged war against the
drug empire with unrivaled success. A tough kid from the Bronx, he grew up
to use his cunning, his karate, and savage street smarts to bring to trial
over 3,000 criminals while posing as a Mafia soldier, a Puerto Rican
middleman, a Colombian dope dealer and a priest.

This is the stunning true story of Levine's legendary career, an account of
the drug underworld that is as compelling and personal as it is contro-

and Beverly Hills mansions, this extraordinary book shows us the daring,
the deceptions, and the triumphs of the unsung hero of our times.

highlights of training sessions and specific tips and pointers to other law

How?  Hound, harry and harrass "recreational" drug users. Make them suffer.
Take away all the pleasure they get from drugs. Find them, prosecute them,
and personally SUE them for all they've got. When there's few drug users
there'll be fewer dealers. Hitting them from the top down doesn't work.
Like Levine says, it's time we tried new tactics: Hit them from the bottom
up, and eradicate the base that supports the dealers. This book tells us

This one is a rousing tale of a trucker accidentally turned bounty hunter,
and later recruited to focus his attention on the war on drugs. Fascinating
reading -- every page of it -- and telling it like it really is today.

From the back cover:

"The drug pushers and smugglers agree: there ought to be a law against Tex

cocaine smugglers to crooked Customs Agents to white slavers, Tex Brown has
seen them all -- from the inside out.

One of the most effective undercover men in the Southwest, Tex is a long
distance trucker who began his career by hunting down bail jumpers. He now
cruises the West in his Mack truck, running cargo and contraband, looking
for criminals and building cases in the war against drugs. This is his true

Going where no ordinary lawman could go -- for he carries no badge -- Tex
Brown has stood face to face with the most dangerous law breakers in the
West, and used a fast gun and amazing courage to bring them to justice."

From the book covers:

"They were ruthless and corrupt, ruined lives and reputations, and
inflicted mindless brutality. The S.S.? The K.G.B.? Guess again...
it's the L.A.P.D.!

In Los Angeles, police corruption is much more than unmarked envelopes
stuffed with cash. It's a total corruption of power...

One night in Orange County, a helmeted figure on a motorcycle pulled
alongside an unmarked LAPD car and emptied a machine pistol at the cop
inside. Elite OCID Detective Mike Rothmiller lived to tell the story. Now,
with veteran journalist Ivan Goldman, he rips the lid off of Chief of
Police Daryl Gates' LAPD - and reveals, for the first time, the dirty
secrets of the elite unit whose crushing power and vast influence kept many
of America's most prominent citizens in its iron grip:

The OCID (Organized Crime Intelligence Division), a secretive unit within
the Los Angeles Police Department, used an elaborate spy network and
illegal surveillance devices to spy on everyone from Robert Redford and
Jerry Brown to Connie Chung and Mohammed Ali. No crime was necessary. Any
public figure or Hollywood star was fair game...

OCID wanted to know who was straight, gay, left, right, friend, foe.
Sometimes it shredded its own files - but the most sensitive files were
untraceable, out of reach of ACLU pests and court orders...

OCID planted a mole in Mayor Tom Bradley's staff and collected dirt on City
Council members...

Supposedly privilege information from banks, airlines, credit card
companies and the IRS was readily available to, and used by, the OCID..."

These Cops are more likely to read criminals their last rites!

The L.A.P.D.'s Special Investigation Section (S.I.S.) is so "special" that
even the mayor of L.A. did not acknowledge the existence, assignments and
tactics of this secret squad under the command of men like Daryl Gates (the
Police Chief pressured out after Rodney King and the L.A. riots.)

The assignment of the S.I.S. is to stop dangerous repeat offenders. And
stop them they do! First, the S.I.S. would often track their prey and wait
until a violent crime was actually in progress. Assured of the perpetra-
tor's criminal intent and guilt, the squad often "executed" justice on the
spot.

A federal jury found members of the S.I.S. guilty of violating civil rights
laws and of using excessive force in March, 1992. The special unit contin-
ues to operate despite ongoing investigations by the F.B.I.

After twenty-five years undercover with the mobs, Billy Breen surfaced to
tell the harrowing true story of how he burrowed into the living heart of
organized crime - and how the FBI lost it's nerve!  A charismatic con man,
he played his dangerous games not for money or glory, but to see mob heads
roll - and roll they did. While working with the FBI and local law enforce-
ment agencies, Billy Breen:

* opened the way to the biggest cocaine bust in history

* played a key role in solving the murder of Federal District Judge John H.
Wood and the related attempt on the life of a government prosecutor - the
FBI's biggest case since the Kennedy assassination

* unraveled the mob's national network for handling stolen goods

* emerged from deep cover to fire the opening shots in U.S. Attorney

once said, "I wouldn't want to have to start Bill's car every morning."

From the back cover:

"The true story only Wambaugh could tell. A band of California cops set
loose in no-man's land to come home heroes, or come home dead.

Not since Joseph Wambaughs's bestselling THE ONION FIELD has there been a
true police story as fascinating, as totally gripping as ... LINES AND
SHADOWS. The media hailed them as heroes. Others denounced them as lawless
renegades. A squad of tough cops called the Border Crime Task Force. A
commando team sent to patrol the snake-infested no-man's-land south of San
Diego. Not to apprehend the thousands of illegal aliens slipping into the
U.S., but to stop the ruthless bandits who preyed on them nightly -
relentlessly robbing, raping, and murdering defenseless men, women and
children.

The task force plan was simple. They would disguise themselves as illegal
aliens. They would confront the murderous shadows at night. Yet each time
they walked into the violent blackness along the border, they came closer
to another boundary line - a fragile line within each man. And crossing it
meant destroying their sanity and their lives.

With each book, it seems, Mr Wambaugh's skill as a writer increases. In

police work and the intimate lives of policemen  that, for my money, is his

get a real education. Andy Warhol's death, the School of Fourteen Bells (a
South American pickpocket-training school), prostitutes working the Holland
Tunnel, a machete-wielding cabbie, and a woman who took a bath in her
children's blood... they're all about to teach him about life in the Big
City and our criminal justice system.

From his bumbling rookie days to trying cases as a seasoned A.D.A.,
Heilbroner portrays this dark, alluring world only as one who's been there
can. His job was to apply the law: his passion was to offer justice. His
bitter-sweet, sometimes hilarious, often shocking story is a timely and
moving tale of crime and punishment today."

CITY, WITHOUT JOINING UP YOURSELF AND TAKING YOUR CHANCES ON THE MEAN
STREETS. AN EXTRAORDINARY WORK.  Nothing I have read throws you into the
crucible of big-city police work the way this book does. It is a gritty and
gut-wrenching piece of reportage that reads more like a well-crafted work
of fiction." - Nicholas Proffitt, author of The Embassy House.

"THE BEST DAMNED TRUE-LIFE COP BOOK OF THE YEAR." - Bill Granger, author of
The Zurich Numbers.

"The action is breathtaking and the book is a spellbinding view of a world
like no other." - Detroit News.

SNIPER'S MOON, by Carsten Stroud (author of Close Pursuit).

From the Back cover:

"Detective Frank Keogh has a rare gift - for killing. He picked it up in
the jungles of Viet Nam and perfected it on New York's mean streets. It's a
talent that comes in handy when you're a sniper for the NYPD. But over the
years his calling has produced a numbness that has his partner worried: Is
Frank finding it too easy to pull the trigger? Then, when two savagely
mutilated bodies are found with a connection to him, Frank finds himself a
fugitive, dodging cops and meeting violence on a cross-country chase to
find the man who framed him."

"A powerful police procedural by a man who knows the force." - Los Angeles
Times Book Review.

"An epic police thriller... crackling with narrative energy.. and a deep-
grained savvy about cops ways and mores." - Kirkus.

BLACK SAND, by William J. Caunitz (bestselling author of One Police Plaza)

From the back cover:
"A brutal machine-gun massacre at a seaside resort kicks off a deadly hunt
for a priceless ancient artifact, with two hardened street detectives
thrown together as unlikely partners. Detective Lieutenant Teddy Lucas is
the brooding head of a foul-mouthed squad of New York City detectives, and
Major Andreas Vassos is a veteran Greek cop motivated by justice and a
raging need for vengeance. Together they plunge into a shadowy underworld,
where Lucas chases searing love. Vassos pursues an obsessive passion - and
the toughest case of their careers could get them slammed into a New York
City sidewalk."

"Gritty, authentic... there's enough suspense, action, murder, and mayhem
to keep any reader turning the pages long into the night." - Detroit News

"An expert police procedural." Los Angeles Times Book Review

"Intricate, savvy, and whipcord tense." - San Francisco Examiner

                       Catalog Sales - Refund Policy

There are often many books by different authors on the same subject. If you
were to buy them all, you can expect to find a certain amount of overlap of
general information. There are usually a few differences in each book. It's
difficult to say which one is the best of its kind because each author and
reader has different experience and areas of knowledge. That's why we list
all books on the same subject that we can.  One book may cover a particular
bit of important-to-you information superficially, another one may go into
more explicit detail.  Getting two or more books on the same subject may be
necessary to get complete coverage.  However, you may be disappointed in
some of them and want a refund. We understand that, and we have a solution:

Videotapes are seldom sold with a money-back guarantee because of the ease
and low cost of copying. And, C.F.I. has subcontracted the mail order book
and video sales to a book-store owner who incurs expenses and takes his
earned commission on each sale. That's why we can't offer a 100% refund.

However, our book and videotape costs are about 50% of the retail price. A
returned book or video can be purchased from you for about about the same
amount as our dealer charges us for it.  So, that's our compromise: a 50%
refund on books and videos that are returned in "like new" condition.

Our refund policy is a no-nonsense, no-questions-asked policy. If you're
not completely satisfied with any of CFI's books or videotapes, return them
for a 50% credit on future purchases or a 50% cash refund. Your choice.

    (Please rewind videotapes when they are returned for credit.)

                       Damaged Books and Videotapes

No refunds will be given if books and videos are not "like new" condition.
Please don't underline words or mark or crease pages. Coffee-cup stains,
cigarette burns, dog-eared pages, and water damage convert them into "used"
books. They can't be resold as "new" and no refund credit will be given.

Videotapes are fragile and might be damaged by insufficient packaging or
careless carrier delivery. If you receive a tape that's flawed or damaged
please return it for an exchange. We'll immediately ship a new tape to you
(with the same title) to replace the damaged one.

Returned items should be carefully packaged to prevent damage. It may be a
good idea to insure them for the list price. If you've taken insurance when
returning items, it will be up to you (the shipper) to collect from the
carrier.

Damaged items received by us for a refund are not acceptable for resale.
You'll be advised by mail of any damaged items and asked if you want the
items returned to you to collect insurance. If no reply to our inquiry
letter is received within 60 days, the damaged items will be considered
abandoned by you and discarded by us. No future claims will be considered.

                                  Prices

Prices are, unfortunately, always subject to change. The same book that was
printed a year or two ago, usually costs more to print the next edition.

Prices in CRIMCAT1 will be effective until January 1994. If you order from
an out-of-date catalog and are short a dollar or two, we may ship the order
and invoice you for the amount due. But, if the amount due is over $5, the
book or video involved may be put on a "back order" status. They will be
shipped when the amount due is received by us, or a refund promptly mailed
to you if you ask to cancel the book or video.

Every six months or so, a new CrimeFighter Catalog will be distributed to
BBSs on our mailing list. When you receive a copy of the latest CRIMCAT,
delete the old version. New versions will have new books and videos listed
with current prices. And, a few books that go out of print will be deleted.

     This version is CRIMCAT1. Look for CRIMCAT2 around December 1993.

                                  Payment

Fledgling mail-order businesses usually find it difficult to get Visa and
Mastercharge merchant accounts from banks. Unfortunately, CFI is in this
category. At this time, we can't offer charge card convenience and we don't
accept C.O.D. orders. (Perhaps in a few months, before the next version of
this catalog, we'll have Visa and Mastercharge and you can FAX the info to
us to expedite orders.) In the meantime:

Checks for payment are accepted but, like many merchants, we found it
advisable to delay shipping until checks are cleared by our bank. That may
take about 2 or 3 weeks depending on where your bank is located.

If a check bounces, we pass on the bank's service charge of $20 and ADD $5
for the extra clerical and collection effort. In such an unhappy event,
the next invoice will include $25 to pay for the NSF check! (We hate that
part too, but you've been warned!)

To avoid delays and NSF problems, please use MONEY ORDERS for payment.
Money orders are available in many supermarkets 24 hours a day, seven days
a week - for about 25 cents at American Express outlets. (Banks and Post
Offices also sell money orders.)

                                Order Form

The next chapter is a blank order form. Use the PRINT menu to select a
chapter. Select PRINT CHAPTER (F5). When you're in the selection window,
use the TAB key to move the cursor into the prompt box, input # 24
and <enter>. If you need two or more pages, repeat the above.

Or, at any time in the future you want to print the order form, use the
shortcut ORDRFORM.BAT file to print it on your printer.

SDN_MISC JUL93 CRIME FIGHTERS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS
FILES: CRIMECAT.SDN

Author: William B. McGhee

A book-reader program makes the 150 page, 24 chapter book easy to read.

This is a book/catalog of descriptions on 400+ CrimeFighter books and
videos of law enforcement related subjects. Many are highly controversial
and won't be found in book stores. Highly recommended for CrimeFighters.

Law enforcement officers too, can upgrade their technical knowledge in many
areas that aren't taught in Police Academies. And everyone who is concerned
about crime and fighting crime need to know what the crooks know as a form
of self-defense against the perps who now take advantage of them.
