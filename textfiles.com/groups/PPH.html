<H1>Groups: The Phido Phreaks</H1>
<P>
A relatively minor textfile-writing group, but still very good friends of the
Works BBS, The Phido Phreaks came out of a Fido BBS in Michigan called
"Thieves' World", run by one Thomas Covenant. 
<P>
Thomas Covenant discovered textfiles.com and provided me with his collection of 
Phido Phreak files, including lots I didn't have and not providing me some I did.
He wrote most of the descriptions you see below, as well as this note:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
All works by The Silver Ghost unless otherwise indicated. Comments by the 
carbon based life form formerly known as Thomas Covenant, now going by
<A HREF="mailto:frogfarm@hempseed.com">damaged justice (frogfarm@hempseed.com)</A>.
<P>
I have refrained from attempting to describe TSG's works of fiction, as no
words of mine could do them justice.

As they say, true perfection of design is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away. SG presents an eloquent case for simplicity.

The only reason I wrote this was a case of "sequel fever" after reading Daemon's <A HREF="PPH/smurfkil.ph2.html">Smurf Kill</A>. The astute and discriminating reader will quickly ascertain that it took me much longer to find a unique and readable voice than it did TSG.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="PPH/chldmagc.tsg.html">chldmagc.tsg</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 2085<BR><TD> A Childrens' Guide to Magic. Douglas Adams has nothing on TSG when it comes to cynicism.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="PPH/classhot.tsg.html">classhot.tsg</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 4432<BR><TD> What's Hot and What's Classic. With Warelok and I pumping out "What's Hot 'n What's Not", TSG decided to gently take us to task by reminding us that popularity is not an indicator of elegance. I have seldom received a more resounding and welcome chiding.
