                                              12-26-88
 Dear Ken:
 I am happy to share my list of medical equipment and
supplies.
 FANNY refers to a "fanny pack", a small 7 pocket day-pack
which I purchased from SI.
 KEEPWITH is a list of the stuff I want close; in the car if
possible.
 BUGOUT is a collection to grab if evacuation is ever
necessary.
 CAMPING includes the things we usually take on a camping
trip.  Hopefully, it includes enough to camp out for 2 weeks.
 STORM will eventually be the all inclusive inventory list.
It will add to CAMPING the reserve inventory and the
necessities for shelter living.
 MEDICAL LIST is Jane Orient's project.  I received it as hard
copy and have gotten only part of it in the computer.
  I hope you find some of this helpful.  Feel free to edit it
to fit your needs.
                                   Sincerely,
                                   Kevin King

MEDICAL LIST
(disinfectants)
     Betadine scrub                               (1 pint)
     Betadine solution                            (1 pint)
     Chlorox (5.25% solution)
          for water purification:
          volume    clear                    cloudy
          1 qt      2 drops                  4 drops
          1 gal     8                        16
          5 gal     1/2 tsp (2.5 cc)         1 tsp (5 cc)
          for cleaning instruments and surfaces:
          1:10 dilution
     Dry Pool Chlorine ("burn out" or "shock treatment")
          65% Calcium Hypochlorite
          24.5 grams (about 10 Tbsp) in 1 gallon of water is
               about equivalent to commercial bleach.
          CAUTION:  The dry material gives off small amounts
               of Chlorine gas.  This may cause symptoms in
               some people.  Keep the container tightly
               sealed.  Prepare solutions in a well
               ventilated area.  Hypochlorite solution
               dissolves blood clots: do not use to irrigate
               wounds.
(antiseptics)
     Hydrogen Peroxide                            (1 pint)

     Acetic acid (5%) (equivalent to vinegar)
          irrigate infected wounds (especially good for
               Pseudomonas)
          irrigate ear for external otitis (use 1/2 strength)
(dressings)
     Gauze pads (4" x 4")                         (800)
                                                  (200/pack)
                                                  (4 packs)
          Non-sterile gauze pads are cheaper, clean enough
          for most uses, and can be sterilized if necessary.
          A small supply gauze pads should be obtained in
          sterile packs.
     Tape (1 inch)                                (12 rolls)
          The best tape is Durapore ("silk") tape
          manufactured by the 3M Company.  (A similar tape
          manufactured by Johnson & Johnson is not nearly as
          good.)  The second choice tape is old fashion
          "canvas" tape.  If tape allergy is a consideration,
          Micropore (paper) tape or Transpore (plastic) tape,
          both also manufactured by the 3M Company, will be
          useful.  Masking tape (like you would use for
          painting) and Scotch tape are both satisfactory
          substitutes for adhesive tape.

          cut into triangular bandages
          can be sterilized if necessary
     Safety Pins (assorted sizes)                 (many)
          The utility of the lowly safety pin extends from
          securing dressings to patching clothes to closing
          wounds to building expedient AM radios.

          shake well before each use.
          NOTE:  excess KI must be present to assure that the
                 solution is saturated.  Some crystals must
                 remain out of solution.
(prescription drugs)
     NOTE:  The following is not intended as a self treatment
     guide, but as a guide to choosing drugs for storage.
     Always seek medical advice before using these potent
     drugs, all of which have potentially serious side
     effects, including death.  Antibiotics should not be
     used when they are not needed (as in viral infections)
     because of side effects and the risk of selecting out
     resistant bacteria.

     For guidance in determining quantities, the usual
     duration of treatment for an episode of illness is about
     10 days.

     All drugs have an expiration date.  This is usually
     determined by the time at which the preparation begins
     to lose potency.  Toxic products may also be formed.
     DO NOT TAKE OUTDATED TETRACYCLINE; KIDNEY DAMAGE MAY
     OCCUR.

     ALWAYS ASK THE PATIENT WHETHER HE IS ALLERGIC TO THE
     DRUG.  IF HE HAS A HISTORY OF HIVES (AN ITCHY SKIN RASH)
     OR WHEEZING OR SWELLING IN THE MOUTH OR THROAT, DO NOT
     GIVE THE MEDICATION, AS A FATAL REACTION MAY OCCUR.

          infections
          (Although the spectrum is limited, this drug is
          relative cheap; also causes fewer side effects such
          as diarrhea and vaginitis.)
     Amoxicillin (250 mg capsules)           (500)
          250 mg or 500 mg tid for urinary, middle ear, lower
          respiratory infection, some types of bacterial

          Intramuscular injection is painful, a local
          anesthetic may be given simultaneously.
          for patients too ill to take oral medications or
          for illnesses like plague or anthrax which may be
          fatal before oral medication is absorbed
     Metronidazole (Flagyl) (250 mg tablets) (500)
          500 mg tid for specific infections
          This drug is useful for certain protozoans such as
          amoebae and Giardia and for anaerobic bacteria such
          as those that normally inhabit the bowel and the
          female genital tract.  It can be extremely useful
          in intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections
          caused by such bacteria.
     Chloramphenicol (500 mg)
          500 mg qid
          for anaerobic infections, typhoid and other
          Salmonella infections, psittacosis, rickettsial
          infections
          This drug causes fatal aplastic anemia in about
          1 in 50,000 patients treated with it.  It may be
          difficult to obtain.
     Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole           (500)

Some excellent broader spectrum drugs, especially amoxicillin
with clavulanic acid (Augmentin) and ciprofloxacin are not
included solely because of expense.
