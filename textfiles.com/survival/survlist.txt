This represents a list that you can fill all, or part of, depending on your
needs and requirements.  Print the list and put a check-mark next to each
item as you store it away.  Don't try to fill this in a few weeks, but just
try to get 1 item at least per week, store it away, and then go on to next.
Some of the items are common sense, things that you should have in your house
anyway in case of emergency or need.  Others are more "hard-core" and you
may opt not to purchase it - in that case, line through the item.
