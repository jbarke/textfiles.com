                       Inverter Power Specifications

How much usable power do inverters really give you? This question is much
harder to answer than it might seem. The main problem is that we don't have
a commonly accepted rating standard. For example, we call the Trace 2012 a
2000 watt inverter but actually it will only do 2000 watts for up to 30
minutes. The continuous rating is only about 1340 watts. Both Heart & Trace
600 watt inverters have continuous ratings of only 400 watts. Even
"continuous ratings" have different standards. According to a Heart
inverter graph, the 1200W model has a continuous rating of about 1000
watts. According to the UL method of rating, the continuous output for this
inverter is only 750 watts. Our new Dimensions Inverters are all rated
according to this strict UL standard and we hope it will become a standard
used by all companies.
