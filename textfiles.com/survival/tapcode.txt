I was listening to a speaker talk about the vietnam pow's tapcode.  It's both
simple and sophisticated.  Check it out.

First, you drop the letter K.  It's redundant and that makes a nice simple 25
letters to work with.  then you set up a matrix, to help your memory. the
matrix goes like this.


          | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |   ... .  . .  ... ...  .... .....
         -+---+---+---+---+---+   .... ...  ..... ....  ... ..  . .
         1| A | B | C | D | E |   ... ...  .... .  . ...  ..... .
         -+---+---+---+---+---+   .... ....  . .  ..... ...
         2| F | G | H | I | J |   ... .  .... ...  .... .  ..... .   ?
         -+---+---+---+---+---+
         3| L | M | N | O | P |
         -+---+---+---+---+---+
         4| Q | R | S | T | U |
         -+---+---+---+---+---+
         5| V | W | X | Y | Z |
         -+---+---+---+---+---+

It can also work as a visual.  Touch left elbow, right elbow, left knee,
right knee, rub head.   Etc.

Later
