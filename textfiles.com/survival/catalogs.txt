BEFORE DESCRIBING THIS COMPANY'S PROD-
UCT IT IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT IT
IS ILLEGAL TO OWN OR IMPROVISE ANY TYPE
OF DEVICE WHICH IS DEFINABLE AS A FIRE-
ARM SILENCER WITHOUT PROPER FEDERAL AND
STATE LICENSING (WHERE REQUIRED). NOW
KNOWING THIS DO YOU ALSO KNOW THAT AN
ORDINARY PLASTIC SOFT-DRINK BOTTLE CAN
BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY QUIET THE MUZZLE
BLAST OF MOST FIREARMS .22 IN PARTI-CULAR? THAT'S A FACT! A ONE OR TWO 
LITER PLASTIC SOFT-DRINK BOTTLE WHEN
PROPERLY FITTED TO THE MUZZLE OF A 
FIREARM WILL SUPPRESS IT ALMOST AS EFF-
ECTIVELY AS WILL A $200 MACHINED DEVICE
. THIS COMPANY DOESN'T SELL SOFT DRINK
BOTTLES BUT THEY SELL ADAPTERS WHICH
ENABLES A PERFECT FIT ON MOST GUNS.
REMEMBER TO OBSERVE THE APPLICABLE LAWS
AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE PUT-
TING ONE OF THESE ON YOUR GUN. (I'D 
HATE TO SEE YOU CHOKING YOUR CHICKEN
IN LEAVENWORTH FOR FIVE YEARS!). GIVE
THE FOLKS AT L&M A CALL OR WRITE FOR
INFORMATION ON AVAILABLE MODELS FOR
DIFFERENT GUNS. THESE ADAPTERS ARE ONLY
$9 EACH.
