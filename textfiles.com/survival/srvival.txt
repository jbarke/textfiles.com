(survival.list)                  SURVIVAL LIST                    Rev. 1/18/91


FOOD
----
* MRE (Meal, Ready to Eat)'s - enough to last 30 days
* 2 months of food in the pantry (American Red Cross recommends canned food)
   - Canned veggies (Use water in the can as supplemental drinking water)
   - Corn, potatoes, peas, canned
   - Canned fruit - pears
   - Canned tuna
   - Beans, canned
   - Beef stew, canned
   - Chicken, canned white meat
   - Chili, canned
   - Milk, canned
   - Granola bars
   - Peanut butter and jelly
   - Crackers
   - Dried beans, rice, pasta
   - Warm drinks 
   - Pudding, canned
   - Juices
   - Cereals
   - Nuts, raisins, candy, soups
   - Dried fruit
   - Extras - catsup, honey, jam/jelly, salt/pepper
   - Date the cans and rotate stock
   - Store non-perishable foods in empty coffee cans
* Can opener (non-electric)
o Also about 4 weeks worth of backpacking food, freeze dried & nitrogen packed
o High caloric items to keep up your strength
o Add a supply of good single malt scotch to your stash.  (This is no joke.)
  Aside from the fact that it makes good trading material, and *maybe* an OK
  field expedient pain killer or disinfectant (don't take my word on the 
  latter), it's a great way of calming shot nerves.  Keep in mind that even
  though it may feel like it warms you, it really does the opposite, which
  can be bad in cold weather.  Also, don't get so squashed that you can't
  respond to aftershocks or emergency situations.  Guns and booze don't mix.
o cigarettes or pipe tabacco (if you're a smoker, so don't start now)      :^)

WATER
-----
* 50 to 60 gallons of water - 1/2 - 1 gallon/day
   - Heavy 5 gallon storage containers from Tri-City (about $14 each)
   - 30 and 40 gallon storage containers from Rational Behavior
   - Hand water filter/pump (They can be purchased at Big 5 and will filter
     almost any dirty water into clean).  It will also kill bacteria such as 
     Giardia.  It won't take out things unless the molecules are bigger than 
     2 microns.


CLOTHING
--------
* Good solid footwear (with ankle support)
   - Combat boots

   - Wool & cotton blend socks 
   - Goose-down or Dacron II backpacking clothing
* Layered clothing
   - Windbreaker outerwear (gortex if possible)
   - Wool medium layer - It stays warm even when wet (Don't forget mothballs)
   - Cotton or polypropalene inner layer
   - Silk is also very good

     pry, to make emergency shelters, do emergency surgery, kill alien invaders

     knife) to do yet more surgery, as well as more mundane things such as peel
     veggies, cut rope, open boxes

FIRST AID KIT GEARED TO MAJOR TRAUMA
-------------------------------------
* Sterile eye wash
* Any long-term medications for family or pets (make sure they are current)
* Large cold packs (disposable) - Kwik-Cold is the best brand I've used.
* 1 space blanket
* Bandages - store in Zip Lock bags
   - 2 4-inch wide roller bandages (Bulk non-sterile)
   - Not all roller bandages are conforming, or stretch( plain gauze won't 
     adhere well)
   - J&J SOF, and the Kendall Conform are the best, both are sold at Med Choice
   - Can pour Betadine on the dressing before applying it (they do this in ER's)
   - 2 4-inch wide Kerlix rolls (bulky roller bandages)
   - 6 4X4 12 ply gauze dressings
   - 1 Blood Stopper (a VERY multi-use telfa compress dressing)
   - 1 multi-trauma dressing (10X30 heavy duty dressing)
   - Several packages of vasoline gauze (for sealing sucking chest wounds)
   - Adaptic dressings (fine mesh dressings for burns and abbrasions)
   - 2 triangular bandages
   - Bandaids in there somewhere I think, (not real important)
* Betadine
* Hydrogen peroxide
* Hibicleanse anticeptic soap
* Safety pins
* Pad and pen
o Squirt bulbs (for irrigating wounds)
o 1 unit instant glucose
o Air splints or 1 wire splint (just in case I can't find cardboard)

   - Pediatric cuff (sized BP cuff for kids and little old women) 
o Latex exam gloves (several pairs, disposable)

o Tape (I hardly ever use tape)
o Steri Strips or butterfly closures
   - Large open wounds are only to be covered with a sterile dressing and left
     to heal/close by themselves.  This way, drainage takes place as the dress-
     ing is replaced daily.
o Book called "Emergency War Surgery" that outlines the steps to perform
  appendectomies, amputations, etc.
o Backpack to carry it all in
o 1 set of 5 oral airways (see explanation below)
   - Airways are meant to be used primarily in conjunction with ventilation
     equipment, resue masks, bag valve masks etc. If used improperly, or with
     the wrong size, a patient's airway could be blocked. This especially can
     happen if they're not inserted using the correct technique.
o 1 oxygen euipment tubing (connect my mask to supplimental O2,VERY important)
o Surgical scrub brushes (Med Choice has) packaged in betadine or hebicleanse
o Trauma Shears (actually, I carry those on my belt)
o 'Extractor' venom pump kit
o Book called "Emergency War Surgery" that outlines the steps to perform
  appendectomies, amputations, etc.

   - Warm shoes
   - Rugged gloves (cheap mil-surplus leather gloves and removeable wool liners
     are great.  For upscale folks, a set of deerskin black leather gloves with
     wool liners from Eddie Bauers.)
   - The nice thing about military clothes and stuff is a) it's rugged and b)
     it often is inter-designed to work with other components (Ex: the M-65

     gloves).

OFFICE

HOME
----

   - Check immediately if the water main has broken
   - Listen to see if you can hear water leaving the water tank
   - Close main off to preserve the water in the HW tank
   - Shut-off valve on the tank
* Evaluate home and work-area for their strengths and weaknesses in the event
  of an emergency---ie, where are the safest--and not-so-safe--places, know

  store equipment, etc....

     Have some brochures or handouts for them. 


COPING

   - Eating things you would normally eat
   - Assigning chores to those who could handle tasks


WHERE TO BUY
------------
o Rational Behavior Co, 1615 El Camino Real West, Mountain View, 415-969-5555
   - Military surplus
   - MRE (Meal, Ready to Eat)'s - 72 meals per case.  Cases run $79.95 - $89.95
   - Canned water, waterproof containers for grain/water, first aid kits, etc.

o Cambrian Surplus, 2059 Woodard Rd, San Jose, Phone:  377-6953
        Hours:  Mon-Fri 10-6
                Sat     9:30-5:30
                Sun     11-4

o Stevens Creek Surplus, 3449 Steven Creek Blvd., Santa Clara-San Jose (Between
  San Thomas & Winchester), Phone:  244-0773
        Hours:  Mon-Fri 9-9
                Sat-Sun 10-6

        Tonight I'll login and post addresses of two mail-order places
        that sell *new* genuine mil-surplus stuff.  There's a lot of cheap
        copies of mil-surplus stuff out there, and it's not as good quality.
        The U.S. Cavalry Store catalogue has nice little "Official Issue"
        stamps on all the appropriate items, which helps a lot.

        The local "surplus" places are pretty poor pickings unless you're
        an experienced shopper, but hey, check em' out yourself on a weekend.
        If nothing else you find lots of cool stuff to examine :-), and they
        often do carry useful, mundane, things like camping gear, or knives.

        The best I have is:

        U.S. Cavalry Store
        2855 Centennial Ave.
        Radcliff, KY 40160-9000
        Orders: 1-800-626-6171
        Fax: 1-502-352-0266
        Store: 502-351-1167

        The second best is:

        Brigade Quartermasters
        1025 Cobb International Blvd.
        Kennesaw, GA 30144-4300
        Orders: 1-800-486-4327
        FAX: 404-426-7726
        Telex: 54-2461
        Store: 404-428-1234

                Both places sell hunting, camping, and mil-surplus type
                stuff.  I think U.S. Cavalry has a better selection, so
                if you ordered only one catalogue that would be the one.
                U.S. Cavalry has official military issue items so listed,
                which makes it easier to pick them out.  They also have
                stuff like MREs, water purifiers, goretex clothing, knives,
                flashlights, backpacks, sleeping bags, etc.  Both places
                also stock a selection of books on wilderness survival,
                and other esoteric subjects.

                Note: a few things in these catalogs may be illegal to 
                carry, or in a couple of cases, own in California.  Unless
                you decide to order something bizarre like a blowgun or
                nunchaku, you shouldn't have any problems, but be aware.

BOTH places I noted sell paramedic shears if anyone is interested.

        The serrated edge referred to is probably the "Spyder Edge" developed 
        by Spyderco knifes and now ripped off, uh, I mean proudly used, by 
        other manufacturers.  I believe it's supposed to last longer than a 
        flat edge and cuts better.  The primary down side is that it requires 
        a special crockstick affair to sharpen when it does get dull, but I 
        think this is pretty easy if you have the crockstick set.

o SI Outdoor Food and Equipment
  P.O. Box 3796
  Gardena, Ca 90247
  213-324-8855

  They publish a catalog of specials bi-monthly.   It takes several
  issues of the catalog to get through their whole product line.

  There is a good source for alternative energy equipment called 
  Real Goods.  They sell an inch thick book/catalog for $10.  I'll get 
  their address and put it out in another email.


  A surgical supply house is the only place to buy supplies
  for trauma. Drug stores don't carry the quality or selection
  of items that are needed to really render serious care.

  Two companies that are popular with EMT's are Dynamed and
  Life Assist, both up North a ways. Both places will provide
  a catalog.

  However, locally, in San Jose there's a supply store called
  Med Choice that has the lowest prices available.
  

  There is another good source for preparedness items:

o Nit-Pak
  13243 Rosecrans Ave
  Santa Fe Springs, Ca 90670
  213-802-0099
  800-866-4876
