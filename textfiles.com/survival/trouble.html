                    WHEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE 
 ======================================================================= 
 
                    WHEN QUESTIONED BY A POLICEMAN: 
 
 After giving  your name and address YOU SHOULD THEN BE QUIET. But if you 
 think you are innocent and that you could quickly explain what happened, 
 you might  answer the  policeman's questions,  but YOU  CAN STOP TALKING 
 WHENEVER YOU WANT. Remember, anything you say may be used against you in 
 court. You  do NOT  have to  produce ID  or give  your name  unless  the 
 officer has other grounds to arrest you. 
 
                            WHEN ARRESTED: 
 
 Even if you are innocent of any crime, DON'T FIGHT BEING ARRESTED. A 
 policeman can use force if you resist. 
 
 If the  policeman searches you, TELL HIM YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SEARCHED, 
 but do not try to stop him. 
 
                        WHEN QUESTIONED AT HOME: 
 
 You have  a special  right to  privacy in your home. Even if a policeman 
 asks, DO NOT ASK HIM INTO YOUR HOME. But if he has a search warrant, you 
 must let him in. 
 
                        WHEN STOPPED IN YOUR CAR: 
 
 Show the policeman your driver's license, car registration and insurance 
 certificate when he asks for it. Remember, YOU SHOULD KEEP QUIET and YOU 
 CAN STOP  TALKING AT  ANY TIME.  If the officer asks to look inside your 
 car, TELL  HIM YOU DO NOT WANT HIM TO SEARCH YOUR CAR, but do not try to 
 stop him.  An officer  usually does  not need a warrant to search a car, 
 but he  does need  probable cause  of a crime such as an informer's tip, 
 the smell of marijuana, or a furtive gesture. 
 
 
                   WHEN TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION: 
 
 If you  are not free to leave, ASK TO SEE A LAWYER IMMEDIATELY. You have 
 the right  to make  a telephone  call to  get a  lawyer or  to call your 
 family to  get one for you. If you cannot pay a lawyer, you have a right 
 to a  free lawyer if you are charged with a serious crime. DO NOT SAY OR 
 SIGN ANYTHING UNTIL THE LAWYER IS WITH YOU. 
 
                             BAIL: 
 
 After being  arrested, the  police must  take you  to a judge. The judge 
 will say  how much bail you must pay to get out, but if you live or work 
 in the  town YOU  SHOULD ASK  THE JUDGE  TO FREE YOU "O.R." (on your own 
 recognizance) instead  of paying  bail or  posting bond.  This means you 
 promise to  come to  your trial  on the day the judge says. If you are a 
 juvenile, you  ordinarily can  be released to your parents without bail, 
 so demand that the police call them.
