Ingredients:
1 bunch raw spinach           some bean sprouts
bacon bits (fake or real)     parmesan cheese
                              
Dressing:                     1 egg
1/2 cup lemon juice (fresh    1/2 cup vegetable oil (or
is best)                      any type of oil)
1-3 cloves of garlic          2 Tbs. Dijon mustard
(depends on you)
5 Tbs. parmesan cheese        dashes of salt
dashes of pepper              3 dashes Worcestershire
                              sauce (makes it zesty!)

Instructions:
In a Tupperware shaker bottle or some other container, put
in one egg, add the lemon juice and the oil.  Cut the garlic
cloves into tiny pieces and add them in.  Mix in the
remaining dressing ingredients and shake! Refrigerate for at
least 1 hour before serving.
Make sure you carefully wash the spinach (the bunches are
awful sandy!). Tear apart into small salad sized pieces.  In
a small bowl for each guest or in a large one (your choice)
put in spinach with bean sprouts on top. Sprinkle with
parmesan and bacon bits.  At serving time pour dressing over
and Voila!!

Comments:
My mom used to make this and once you have it once you
develop a craving for it.  This salad is very tasty and
impressive to dinner guests and does NOT taste like cooked
spinach at all!
