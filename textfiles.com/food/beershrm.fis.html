A few days ago, someone asked about a recipe for beer shrimp; here's one
I happened to find:

Beer-Boiled Shrimp

1 12-ounce can beer
4 whole cloves
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. dried dillweed
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 lb. fresh or frozen shelled shrimp
Melted butter or cocktail sauce

Directions:
   In saucepan combine beer, cloves, garlic, bay leaf, salt, dillweed, and
pepper.  Bring to boiling over high heat; boil 5 minutes.  Add shrimp;
return to boiling.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes or till shrimp turn pink.  Drain;
discard cloves and bay leaf.  Serve shrimp hot with melted butter or cold
with cocktail sauce.
   Makes 8 appetizer servings.
