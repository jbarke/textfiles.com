  1/4  cup                   butter or margarine
    4  cups                  onions, thinly sliced
    2  can (10.5 oz ea)      beef broth (bouillon)
  3/4  cup                   COCA-COLA
    1  tsp                   salt
  1/2  tsp                   vinegar

                             Parmesan cheese, grated


In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter/margarine.  Add onions and cook until they
are golden, do not brown.  Add the undiluted beef broth, 1 soup can of water, 
Coca-Cola, salt, vinegar, and pepper.  Cover and simmer 20 to 25 minutes.

In a broiler, toast one side of the French bread slices.  Turn and generously
sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.  Toast until browned.  Into deep bowls, ladle
the soup and top with the toast, cheese-sided up.  Makes 4 servings or about 6
cups.
