-----------  ------------     --------------------------------------------------
 1 to 1-1/2  lb(s)            top round or sirloin steak, boneless
          2  Tbsps            oil
          1  clove            garlic, minced
          1  tsp              salt
          1  cup              beef broth (bouillon), canned and undiluted
          1  cup              green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into
                              thin strips
          1  cup              celery, thinly sliced
        1/4  cup              onions, thinly sliced
        1/2  cup              COCA-COLA
          2  medium           tomatoes, ripe
      2-1/2  Tbsps            cornstarch
        1/4  cup              COCA-COLA
          1  Tbsp             soy sauce
                              rice, cooked and hot


Trim all fat from the meat and cut into pencil-thin strips.  In a deep skillet
or Dutch oven, heat oil, garlic, and salt.  Add the meat and brown over high
heat, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a fork.  Add the beef broth.
Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the meat is fork-tender.

Stir in the green pepper strips, celery, onions, and 1/2 cup of Coca-Cola.
Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  Do not overcooked; the vegetables should be
tender-crisp.  Peel the tomatoes, cut into wedges, gently stir into meat.

Blend cornstarch with the 1/4 cup of Coca-Cola and the soy sauce.  Stir mixture
into the meat and cook until sauce is thickens, about 1 minute, stirring lightly
with a fork.  Serve over hot rice.  Makes 6 (3/4 cup) servings.
