    1  cup              old-fashioned rolled oats
  1/2  cup              sugar
2-1/2  tsps             baking powder
  1/2  tsp              baking soda
    1  tsp              salt
    1                   egg
    3  Tbsps            oil or shortening, melted
  1/2  tsp              vanilla extract
    1  cup              COCA-COLA
    1  cup              prunes, very well drained and coarsely chopped *
  1/2  cup              walnuts, chopped
                        prune halves (optional)

*  you may substitute 1/2 cups of dried prunes.


Lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup; level off.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, beat with a fork, the egg, oil, and vanilla extract until well
blended.  Add to the flour mixture.  Add the Coca-Cola, prunes, and nuts; blend
thoroughly with a spoon.  Turn into a well-greased, lightly floured, 9x5x3-inch
loaf pan.  Garnish with prune halves, if desired.

Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 1 hour or until a wooden
toothpick inserted in the center comes out cleans.  Cool on a rack for 20
minutes before removing the bread from the pan.  Store in foil overnight before
slicing.  Makes 1 loaf.
