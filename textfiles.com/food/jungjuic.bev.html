Ingredients:
1 liter bottle 190 proof      1 liter bottle Tropical
Everclear                     flavor Schnapps
1 liter bottle Absolut        9-15 frozen juice
Citron                        concentrates (to taste for
                              intensity of alcohol)
As much fruit (preferably     
melons, apples, oranges and
strawberries, the rest tend
to decompose in the Jungle
Juice too fast--if you're
not worried about how long
you'll have it, cherries and
raspberries and bananas are
a treat).

Instructions:
Combine all the alcohol in a large cooler, (clean, of
course), and then drop in bite sized chunks of fruit.  Add
the concentrate last, and then let it soak(ferment?:) for
about four hours.  Enjoy.  Lots and lots and lots and
lots...

other stuff runs 100 P.  And BE CAREFUL with this
stuffalcohol poisoning is quick and deadly, and very easy
with anything over 100 proof.  ALWAYS mix Everclear with
lots of other stuff.)  Anyway, here's my favorite summer
drink--Jungle Juice:
