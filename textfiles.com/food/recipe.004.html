    4  lbs              beef rump, sirloin tip, or round bone chuck, boneless
1-1/2  cup              vinegar
    1  cup              COCA-COLA
  3/4  cup              water
    3                   onions, sliced
    2  stalks           celery, sliced
    2                   carrots, sliced
   10  whole            black peppers
   10  whole            cloves
    3                   bay leaves
    2  Tbsps            sugar
1-1/2  tsps             salt

-----  ------------     --------------------------------------------------------
    3  cups             drippings plus strained marinade
    5  Tbsps            flour
    5  Tbsps            ginger snap crumbs


2 to 4 days before serving, wipe the meat with a damp cloth, then place in a
large plastic bag.

In a large bowl, throuoghly combine the vinegar, Coca-Cola, water, onions,
celery, carrots, pepper, cloves, bay leaves, sugar, and salt and pour over meat.
Fasten bag tightly and lay flat in a 13x9-inch pan.  Refrigerate, turning bag
each day. (If you like a sour sauerbraten, let meat marinate 4 days.)

When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade) and dry well.  Rub the surface
lightly with flour.  In Dutch oven, heat oil or shortening and slowly brown the
meat well on all sides.  Add 1 cup of the marinade liquid plus some of the
vegetables and bay leaves.  Cover tightly and simmer on surface heat or in a
preheat, 350 degree F oven for 3 to 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender.  If
needed, add more marinade during cooking to keep at least 1/2-inch liquid in the
Dutch oven.  Remove the meat and keep warm until ready to slice.

Into a large measuring cup, strain the drippings.  Add several ice cubes and let
stand a few minutes until the fat separates out.  Remove fat, then make gravy.
Makes 8 servings.

TO MAKE THE GRAVY:  In the Dutch oven, combine the gravy ingredients, stir and
cook about 5 minutes over medium heat until gravy is thickened.  Taste for
seasonings.  Makes 3 cups of gravy.
