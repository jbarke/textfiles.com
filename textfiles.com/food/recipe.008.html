    1  head, medium      cauliflower, separated into flowerets, washed, and
                         drained
    1                    green bell pepper, washed, cored, seeded, and cut into
                         2-in strips
                         water, boiling
  1/2  cup               celery, very thinly sliced
  3/4  cup               COCA-COLA
    6  Tbsps             wine vinegar or white vinegar
  1/4  cup               sugar
1-1/2  tsp               salt


In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower flowerets and bell pepper strips.
Cover with boiling water.  Let stand for 2 minutes; drain thoroughly.  Add
the celery.

In a small pan, heat the Coca-Cola, wine/white vinegar, sugar, and salt.  Pour
over vegetables.  Toss lightly with a fork, and pack into 1-quart glass jars.
Push down lightly so the liquid covers the vegetables.  Cover and chill
overnight.  This keeps in the refrigerator for several days.  Makes about 1
quart.
