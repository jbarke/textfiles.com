                        Cooking with Pot

     Many people after cleaning their grass throw away the seeds,
stems, and twigs.  I would highly recommend that you save these, as
there are many recipes for these odds and ends.  A tasty hot drink
that resembles tea can be made very simply by tying up all the
waste from your stash into a muslin ball or a piece of cheesecloth.

Use the quantity you have on hand, as the quantity will determine
the strength and potency. Now, drop the cheesecloth containing the
grass into a kettle of water, and bring the water to a boil.  Allow
the kettle to boil for a few minutes, and then remove it from the
flame and let it steep for another five minutes with the grass
still inside.  After this, the drink is ready.  Just add sugar and
lemon to taste.
     If you decide against growing pot, and want to eat your seeds,
there is an interesting recipe for "seed pancakes".  It is prepared
by lightly toasting a quarter cup of seeds in a large frying pan. 
Now, take the seeds from the frying pan and add them to a mixture
of one cup of pancake mix, one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one
tablespoon of butter.  Beat this mixture until it is smooth and
creamy.  Heat a frying pan with a small amount of butter, then pour
in pancake batter.  Turn the pancakes as they start to look done,
or when the edges begin to turn brown.  Repeat procedure until all
batter is used.  Serve pancakes with butter, maple syrup, and
honey.
     For a stimulating drink (sounds like all the rest of the
cookbooks) place eight ounces milk, a few spoonfuls of sugar, a
tablespoon of malted milk, half a banana, and half a tablespoon
grass, and three betel muts in a blender.  Keep the blender working
full speed for a few minutes, then strain and serve.
     If you like candy, it's very simple to make some using pot. 
Take a quarter cup of powdered grass and add water until it equals
a full cup.  Mix this with four cups sugar and two and a half cups
corn syrup.  Now heat in a large pot to 310 degrees, and add red
food coloring and mint flavoring.  Remove the pot from the stove,
and allow the mixture to cool a little, before pouring it onto wax
paper.  When the candy's cool, cut it into squares and eat.
     One of the most common recipes for cooking with pot is
spaghetti.  This recipe doesn't take too much special preparation:
Just when you add your oregane, add at the same time a quarter cup
grass, and allow it to simmer with the sauce.  Be sure to use well
cleaned grass, unless you can get into eating twigs and stems. 
Another way of serving pot with spaghetti is to grind it up very
fine and mix it with some ground cheese.  Then sprinkle the cheese-
pot mixture over the sauce just before eating.
     Dessert is probably the most important stage of the meal,
since it will be the last thing your guests remember before they
pass out all over your table.  For an interesting dessert, grind a
quarter ounce of grass very finely, and add enough water so it
forms a paste.  Now separately dissolve one and a half cups sugar
into two cups milk.  Add to this your pot paste and one lemon rind
grated.  Beat in a half cup heavy cream, until the mixture is firm
and thick.  Now pour the mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. 
Just before you're ready to serve, rebeat the frozen mush until it
becomes light and fluffy.
