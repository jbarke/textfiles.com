-----  ------------     --------------------------------------------------------
2-1/2  lbs              chicken breasts or a chicken, cut-up
                        water
                        salt
                        celery tops
    3  Tbsps            butter or margarine
    1                   tart apple, peeled and diced
    1  medium           onion, thinly sliced
    1  Tbsp             curry powder (or more for experienced palates)
  1/3  cup              raisins
    1  cup              chicken broth
  1/2  cup              COCA-COLA
3-1/2  Tbsps            flour
    1  cup              coffee cream or undiluted evaporated milk
    1  tsp              salt
  1/8  tsp              white pepper
                        rice, cooked and hot


Rinse the chicken pieces.  In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the chicken
with a few celery tops.  Cover and simmer about 1 hour or until fork-tender.
Drain and strain the broth; reserve.  Bone the chicken and cut it into 1/2-inch
pieces to measure about 2-1/2 cups.

In a skillet, melt the butter/margarine.  Add the apple, onion, and curry
powder and saute for 5 minutes, blending well.  Stir in the raisins, 1 cup of
the reserved chicken broth, and the Coca-Cola.

In a bowl, mix flour with the coffee cream/evaporated milk, stirring until
smooth.  Add with salt and white pepper to the onion/apple mixture.  Stir and
cook over low heat until thick and creamy.  Taste for seasoning.  Add the
chicken and turn into a covered container to chill overnight.

Reheat in the top of a double boiler over hot water and serve on cooked rice
with a selection of condiments (See NOTE below).  Makes 6 servings.

NOTE:  Provide a sampling of the following condiments for sprinkling on top of
       each serving:  grated coconut, chopped peanuts, chopped raw onions,
       raisins, sweet pickle relish, chutney, chow chow, and/or lime wedges.
