GOTU KOLA     Irene Yaychuk 
 
Gotu Kola (Centella asiatica, Hydrocotyle asiatica) is an herb 
often confused with another plant, the dried cotyledon (seed 
leaf) of Cola nitida, commonly known as kola nuts, a well-known 
ingredient of Coca-Cola containing 3.5% caffeine.[1]  Gotu Kola 
is not a stimulant, but rather a very nutritious herb indigenous
to hot, humid climates. 
      
Dr. John Heinerman, Medical Anthropologist, presented an address
on Gotu Kola to the Second International Congress for the Study 
of Traditional Asian Medicine, held at Airlanggu University in 
Surabaya, Indonesia, September 2-7, 1984.  He stated that Gotu 
Kola is used as a nourishing food and a valuable medicine in many
cultures. The Hosa and the Mfengu tribes in East Africa have used
it for both purposes. In the Philippines, the leaves are either 
consumed raw in salads or as a tea for tonic and stimulant 
benefits to the body. The leaves have been employed medicinally 
in the French West Indies, and Brazil to cure uterine cancer, 
leprosy and elephantiasis. In the People's Republic of China, 
gotu kola is used for fevers, common cold influenza, sore throat
and liver ailments such as cirrhosis and jaundice.[2] 
      
Folk and traditional medicine have deemed this plant to be a 
brain food, beneficial for memory and senility.  Pharmacist Varro
E. Tryler states that there is currently no evidence to support 
the use of Gotu Kola as a longevity promoter or to substantiate 
the extravagant claims made for it as a revitalizing and healing
herb. Substantial data on its safety and efficacy are, in his
opinion, simply non-existent.[3] 
     
However, separate clinical studies to substantiate folk 
claims for its alleged memory enhancing properties have been done
in the United States and India.[4] 
      
In India, Gotu Kola, an Ayurvedic herb, is called Mandookaparni.
There, an impressive study dealt with the effect of gotu kola on
general mental ability of mentally retarded children. Whole 
plants were dried in the shade, powdered, and made into 1/2 gram
tablets. Half of the thirty children studied were given one gotu
kola tablet and half a placebo tablet daily.  Apart from 
nutritional deficiencies, the children had no major illnesses. A
Binet-Kamat test was administered and the children's Intelligence
Quotients were recorded. Separate tests were also administered to
record any changes in the children's co-operation, memory, 
concentration, attention, vocabulary and overall adjustment. 
After three months, the tests were repeated.   
 
The findings showed there was a very s.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. youngsters taking gotu kola had
increased their powers of concentration and attention.[5]] 
      
Another Indian study showed that gotu kola extracts administered
over a period of 42 months to normal healthy adults in the 45-50
age group had several benefits: haemoglobin increased by a 
significant percent, and the mean levels of blood urea and serum
acid phosphatase were decreased. Subsequent examinations have 
revealed that this herb has brought about a steady increase in 
blood sugar level (statistically significant).[6] A relationship
between hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar levels, and mood swings,
mental illness, fatigue, depression, confusion and schizophrenic
tendencies is well documented. Dr. Heinerman feels that perhaps 
the 'memory enhancing' attributes of gotu kola may be attributed
to the herb's ability to elevate blood sugar levels markedly. 
      
Gotu kola is higher in the B-complex vitamin group than any other
plant previously examined.  This again may account for its 
effects on the brain.[7] It is especially high in thiamine (B1),
riboflavin (B2), and pyridoxin (B6). B complex is necessary in 
providing energy for the body, by converting carbohydrates into 
glucose, a usable form of sugar for the body to burn. The B 
complex is responsible for the normal functioning of the nervous
system as well.[8] A healthy nervous system allows for a better 
functioning and organized brain. 
      
(Other nutrients include numerous free amino acids, especially 
aspartate, glutamate, serine, threonine, alanine, lysine, 
histidine, and aminobutyrate found in greater quantities in the 
roots, but also present in leaves.[9]  The leaves also contain 
measurable amounts of provitamin A or carotene.) 
      
Isolated constituents of gotu kola were applied locally on wounds
in laboratory rats.  This resulted in healthy new connective skin
tissue and increased the tensile strength of the flesh, as well 
as decreased the size of the would area.[10]  Asaticoside, a 
constituent of gotu kola was injected intra-muscularly or 
implanted directly into mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. It
produced a rapid thickening of the skin, an increased production
of white blood cells, increased growth of new blood vessels of 
the connective tissue, and an increased growth of hair and 
nails.[11]  Lupus erythematosus was helped by extracts of gotu 
kola. 
      
Other studies have indicated gotu kola to be effective for 
gastric ulcers, phlebitis and varicose veins. It has been used 
for leprosy and related skin disorders, eye lesions, and muscular
atrophy. 
      
One investigation of gotu kola was conducted in Provo Utah at 
Brigham Young University by a research psychologist who wanted to
demonstrate gotu kola's amazing ability to overcome the negative
effects of fatigue and stress when used in conjunction with 
cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens) and Siberian ginseng 
(Eleutherococcus).

Rodents were fed the three herbs by means of a surgical technique
in which tubing was inserted under the skin, a couple of
centimeters below the junction of the esophagus and 
stomach. Fatigue and stress situations were set up. One involved
swimming in a bucket of cold water, and another was to jump a 
barrier in order to avoid a mild foot shock. Within 24 hours of 
administration of the three herbs, the animals could successfully
clear the barrier after being dried off from the cold water 
treatment. Without the herbs, they required up to 72  hours to 
recuperate in order to jump the barrier. Dr. Mowrey concluded 
that a combination of capsicum, ginseng and gotu kola did have a
beneficial effect on behaviour of stressed or fatigued animals 
whose metabolism are similar in many respects to that of man.[12]

      
From this research carried out in 1975, several large American 
herbal companies developed an "energy and stamina" formula 
utilizing gotu kola. Some of these can be obtained at your local
health food store.
