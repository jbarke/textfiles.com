Sproing, here my special recipe for egg-roll.  Hope that it will help you.
things you need:
    1. one egg
    2. a head of cabbage.
    3. three large carrots
    4. egg roll wrappers - a bag of 25.
    5. about 1lb of pork
    6. fungus mushroom-- buy those in an Oriental store.  just ask the store
       owner.  he or she will know.
    7. pepper
    8. salt
    9. sugar
   10. 1 clove of garlic
   11. fish sauce--just ask to store owner
   12. oil--of course!

what to do next:
    1. get a big bowl or a pot.
    2. put the pork in, one egg, two table spoons of pepper, one table spoon or
       less of salt and sugar, and about 4-5 tbsp of fish sauce.
    3. mix
    4. chop the garlic, the carrots, and the cabbage in thin slices and then

      put in the bowl.
    5. get about a hand full of mushroom and put in the water to let it soak.
      Then boil them for about 5 min. or until they are soften.  after that,
      chop it up and put in the bowl.
    6. mix them together and your mixture is ready to be roll.
    7.  the rest should be easy. roll them up and paste the rolls with the egg
       yolk.
   8.  put oil in pot and fry those rolls.  be careful not to set the stove too
       high of temp. or else the rolls willl turn black before they are done.
