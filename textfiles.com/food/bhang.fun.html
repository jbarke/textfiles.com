                 A refreshing drink for hot summer days



Ganja		1/2 ounce
Poppy seeds	1/4 ounce
Pepper		1/4 ounce
Dry Ginger	1/8 ounce
Caraway seeds	pinch
Coves		pinch
Cinnamon	pinch
Cucumber seeds	1/4 ounce
Cardomom	pinch
Almonds		6 medium
Nutmeg		pinch
Rose		1 fully developed, including hip **
Sugar		8 ounces
Milk		20 ounces

	Begin by bringing ten ounces of water to a rolling boil and remove from
heat.  Add the ganja to the water after removal and let it soak for five
minutes.  The ganja should be kneaded vigorously in the still hot water
to transfer som eof the flavour to the liquid - the ganja is then taken out,
drained and the water set aside.  Remove and stalks or seeds (seeds ?) at
this point.  Place the Ganja on a grinding board or pestle and reduce
to a pulp, adding milk gradually along with all other ingredients, except
the poppy seeds, cucumber seeds & sugar, which are kept seperate.  When all
of the ingredients are mixed into the paste, set aside.  Repeat the process
with the poppy and cucumber seeds, adding milk as needed.  When all of
the seeds have been ground to a paste, set aside.  You should still have
most of your milk left. Add the two paste balls to the remaining milk
and strain through fine muslin. Throw away the filtered substance
and add the sugar, stirirng untul it is dissolved.  Strain again through
muslin, thworing away the residue. Add milk to obtain a consistancy which 
suits your taste, flavoring with the original water if desired. Place the
mixturein a cool place, and, when chilled, serve in 4 ounce portions
preferably before meals.  You may wich to substitute water for milk
in the final solution, but must still grind with milk.  Buttermilk
makes for a heavier but more sensous drink.  In some circles a strong,
moist cheese is ground into the first paste for additional body.


** when cooking with roses it is a good idea to pluck the petals and snip off 
the white areas at their base.  This part of the petal contains a very
bitter substance, but hips are an excellant source of Vitamin C.

stays the running of the reins (gonorrhoea (sic)); clenses the body from
cholor and phlegm."
