    2  squares (1 oz ea)    chocolate, unsweetened
  1/4  cup                  sugar
    1  cup                  coffee, double-strength and hot

mixture is smooth, about 10 minutes.  Pour into a jar.  Cover and chill.  When
ready to serve, stir in the chilled Coca-Cola.  Serve over ice cubes in tall
glasses.

For a beverage, top with whipped cream.  For a dessert, add a scoop of vanilla
ice cream.  Makes 5 cups.
