SEA FOAM FROSTING:

-----  ---------------------     -----------------------------------------------
    2  (1/4 cup)                 egg whites
1-1/2  cups (firmly packed)      light brown sugar
  1/8  tsp                       cream of tartar *
  1/3  cup                       COCA-COLA
    1  tsp                       vanilla extract
       dash                      salt

*  you may substitute 1 tablespoon corn syrup.

TO MAKE THE CAKE:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, baking soda,
and eggs.  Measure the Coca-Cola, stir briskly until the foaming stops; add to
the batter.  Blend ingredients just until moistened, then beat at high speed of
an electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl often.

In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the batter.
Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at medium speed.  Turn
the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured, 13x9x2-inch pan.

Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes or until the cake
tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove cake from pan and turn
right-side up on a rack to finish cooling.

TO MAKE THE SEA FOAM FROSTING:  In the top of a double boiler, combine all the
ingredients except the vanilla extract.  Beat 1 minute at high speed of an
electric mixer.  Place over boiling water (the water should not touch the bottom
of the top half of the double boiler.).  Beat on high speed about 7 minutes
until the frosting forms peaks when the mixer is raised.

Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a large bowl).
Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high speed until thick enough to
spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of the cold banana cake.
