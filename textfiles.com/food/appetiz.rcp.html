Ciliegine Con Prosciutto

Small, cherry-sized balls of cow's milk mozzarella, packed in sealed 
plastic containers are available in the dairy section of many supermarkets 
or speciality stores.

1/2 medium lemon
1 medium garlic clove
2 tbl snipped fresh chives
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 tsp hot red-pepper flakes
9 ounces fresh mozzarella "cherries" or fresh mozzarrella
15 thin prosciutto slices (6 ounces) If you can find Parma it's
worth the extra money.
1 medium bunch dill

Squeeze lemon juice into a medium bowl.  Peel and crush garlic and put
it into the bowl along with the chives, olive oil, and red-pepper
flakes.  Drain and add cheese "cherries" or cut mozzarella into 3/4-
inch cubes and add to the mixture.  Marinate at room temperature at
least 2 hours. (Can cover and refrigerate overnight).  Cut
prosciutto slices in half lengthwise.  Wrap 1 slice of
prosciutto around each piece of cheese and 1 small sprig of dill.
Secure with a toothpick and serve. Let me know if you want any
others.  I have many.  Or if it is something special you
are looking for.  I would be happy to help you knock the
socks off of your aunt.


Baked Brie

Also, baked Brie is fabulous.  If you want to get fancy with the brie, 
saute some mushrooms with tarragon, garlic and a bit of wine until the 
mixture is almost dry (the mushrooms should be sliced or chopped, by the
by), take a wheel of brie, slice it in half, put the mushroom mix in the 
middle, and wrap it in phyllo or puff pastry (the frozen puff pastry works 
fine).  Put in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm everything up.  

At this point, it can be moved to the fridge and kept until needed.  Bake 
it in a moderate oven until the puff pastry browns.  Let sit for 15-20 
minutes before cutting.

You can also use puff pasty scraps to cut out little leaves and stuff to put
on top of the whole thing for decoration.  This is best with the small wheels,
about 5 inches in diameter.


Shrimp wrapped in pea pods

Steam the peas so they're limp.  Boil and peel the shrimp, leaving the 
tails on.  Wrap each shrimp in a pea pod and skewer with a fancy toothpick 
to keep it on.  Have a couple of dipping sauces. 


 Puff Pastry Calzone with Chevre & Artichoke Hearts.

1 PKG frozen pastry shells (6), defrosted
8 oz. Chevre cheese, crumbled or feta cheese
1/4 cup cut up onion slices
8 ounces marinated artichoke hearts, drained & chopped
2 Tablespoons sliced black olives
grated paremasan cheese

Stack 3 pastry shells together & roll them out to measure 8" (this makes
a big one you can do it like this & have people cut off a slice or make
little ones).

Place pastry on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
                               
When you defrost shells don't let them get too soft - just so they are 
still chilled.

Combine the next 4 ingredients & place in center of pastry leaving a 1"
border along the edge.  (you can also add some garlic to the mixture)

Roll out the remaining shells in the same fashion & place over the filling.
Press & sel the edges with the tines of a fork.  Scallop them in a
decorative fashion.  Pierce top with fork & brush tip with a little water
& sprinkle with a little grated parmesan cheese.

You can either bake it now or put it in the fridge until the next day if
need be.

Bake in a 400 oven for about 25 minutes or until top is a deep golden brown.
place in a platter & cut into wedges to serve.  Serves about 6.

If you assemble this in advance that's fine but don't bake it until just
before serving.


Russian Stuffed Eggs

1 doz. large (jumbo) eggs
1/2 lbs large mushrooms
1 bunch parsly
ground black pepper
Mayonnaise (I used Cholestrol Free Kraft)

Boil the eggs for 10 minutes or more (until they're hard)
let them cool off completely.

Chop the mushrooms very finely (a good food processor will help) 
The goal is to have about 2 cups of chopped mushrooms for every
dozen eggs.

Chop 1/2 cup of parsly (very very fine, food processor type fine)

Cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. Mix the egg yolks with 
the mushrooms, parsly and add a tea spoon full of black pepper. 

Add 1/2 cup mayonnaise and stir the whole thing. You should have a 
grey, mushroomy paste. 

Stuff each hollow egg half with heaping teaspoon of the paste. Put
a tiny little bit of mayo on top and stick a parsly leaf on.
Refrigerate before serving. 

Most people grabbed 3 - 4 halves, so plan accordingly. 
If you're handy around the kitchen, 3 dozens of this should not
take you more than 1 hour and you can prepare this hours ahead.


Boboli pizza

1  Boboli (Italian crust in the shape of pizza pre-made up)
   Pesto sauce
   sun dried tomatoes
   grated cheese (Monterey Jack works great)

Spread the pesto sauce on the boboli.  Lay the sun dried tomatoes on 
top (I laid them on paper towels to get some of the excess oil off).
Cover top with grated cheese.  Bake at 450 for 10 minutes or until 
cheese is melted.  Cut in diamond shapes, then cut shapes in half to 
get finger-sized triangles.  Serve warm.


Savory Egg Rolls: (makes around 56 small rolls)

 	1 Medium Carrot (Julienned)
 	6 - 8 Scallions (chopped)
	2 Medium Cloves of Garlic (crushed)
	1/2 Lb. White Mushrooms (chopped) or Shitake if you're from Palm Beach
	3/4 Lb. Spinach (stemmed and broken up)
	10 oz. Cooked Salmon (canned, or preferrably fresh)
	12 - 15 medium to large shrimp (peeled, deveined, and chopped)
	2 Tbsp. Chinese Cooking Wine or Dry Sherry
	2 Tbsp. Dark Soy Sauce (Kikkoman?)
	1 Lb. Package of Won Ton Wrappers
	About 1/2 Package of "White Sauce" mix (for thickener)
	Salt and Pepper to taste
	1 - 2 Cups Vegetable oil (for deep frying)

Filling Preparation:
In a fairly large sauce pan or fry pan, saute garlic, scallions, and carrot 
in a little oil until vegetables are limp. Add wine, soy sauce, spinach,
seafood and mushrooms and stir fry, while breaking up the salmon into
small pieces. Be careful not to overcook. Shrimp should turn pink and 
mushrooms and spinach should have rendered their liquid and gone soft.
Add some of the White Sauce mix a little at a time until good consitency
is reached, and ingredients stick together (like stuffing). Let this
mixture cool before making the rolls.

Stuffing and Frying:
Lay out a sheet of wax paper for a work area, and have within reach a saucer
with a little water. It's best to do three at a time, I found. Place about
a well rounded teaspoon of filling in the lower third of each Won Ton wrapper.
Then fold the two sides part way over the mixture. Wet your finger in
the saucer
and use it to moisten the top end of the wrapper. Roll it up and seal it.
For frying, put enough oil in the pan to just cover the rolls. Fry for 3-5
minutes each until golden brown. You can fry maybe 5-8 at a time depending
on the size of the pan. Turn each occasionally to check doneness and color.
Drain on paper towels.

Dipping Sauce:
This one goes well. Just mix about 2 Tbsps. of Grey Poupon (or similar)
mustard with 1 Tsp. honey and 1 Tbsp. dark soy sauce.

These are not so difficult to make as it may seem. The worst part is the
wrapping, but that might take only 15 minutes or so once you get adept
and have a little practice. These rolls reheat well by  low temp (325)
oven or microwave. Heat before serving, but they're OK at room temp.


Mini Quiche

Prepare a double batch of pie crust or purchase a pie crust
mix.  Roll out and cut in circles using a donut cutter or
cooking cutter.  Place circles into bottom of muffin pan so
that pie crust curls up the sides by about 1/4 inch.  Fill
with any combo of filling.  I used bacon, mushrooms, onions,
and swiss for one filling.  The other was broccoli, onions 
and cheddar cheese.  Place just enough filling so it does 
not go above lip of crust.  Beat 2 eggs and 3/4 cup sour
cream.  Spoon 1 teasp. of egg mixture over each quiche.

Bake for 20-25 min in 375 oven.  
Reheat defrosted quiche for 10 min in a 400 oven.


A Different sort of Rumaki....

Shrimp ( usually use the med size prawns, fresh is better)
*Pepper* Bacon (really really it makes a difference)
A full large head of garlic
several lemons and limes
1 -2 tsp dried red pepper

Peel and devein the shrimp. Marinate them with all the garlic (peeled
and crushed), the red pepper and enough of equal amounts
of fresh lime and lemon juice to cover all the shrimp. Marinate in
the 'fridge for 3-6 hours. I usually do this in the morning and let them
go all day.

After marinating, drain the shrimp (If you are grilling outside
I recommend that you save the marinade and baste with it) and cut the
bacon strips in half. Wrap the bacon around the shrimp and secure
with a toothpick. Either grill over mesquite basting with
the reserved marinade (the favored method) or broil in the oven. 
You may pre-grill these and refrigerate, then warm in the broiler
prior to serving. In fact, I think they even taste better that way!


Layered Bread Loaves

order loaves of bread from a bakery (or bake yourself if you're
really ambitious).  you can even ask them to make them in pastel
shades if you're so inclined.  just ask them to slice the bread
horizontally for you ... so you have about 5 or 6 long slices.
trim the crust and spread/stuff/fill with whatever you like.  i've
used pate, cream cheese (again, tinted if you want) with chopped
olives, cherries, nuts, whatever ... or you can use any one of the
prepared flavored cream cheeses in the supermarket.  roll up,
fasten with toothpicks, wrap first in saran, then in foil (the
saran keeps the foil from getting stuck to the rolls), and freeze
for an hour or so.  remove from the freezer an hour or so before
you're going to serve them and slice.  you have pretty little
pinwheel-looking things.


Mushroom sandwiches

this one takes a little longer.  chop up some fresh mushrooms and
onions, and saute in butter, margarine, oil, whatever until the
onions are clear.  drain and set aside until cool.  on cocktail
bread (rye or pumpernickel), pile a mound of mushrooms and onions,
grated swiss cheese, grated italian cheese (i use locatella), and
bread crumbs.  broil until the swiss melts, and serve immediately.



Filled Tortillas

6 flour tortillas (El Ranchito brand work best)
Salsa (optional)
1 pkg (12-16 oz) cream cheese (softened)
1 1/2 tbl chopped black olives (measurement is a guess)
4 jalipinios chopped fine (fresh are better than canned) (more or less to taste)
1/4-1/2 tsp chili powder
3/4 tsp Johnnys (or other) seasoning salt

Mix softened (can be done in the microwave) cream cheese, olives, jalipinos,
chili powder, and seasoning salt.  Spread a thin layer on tortilla going
all the way out to the edges.  Roll tortilla. Repeat for each tortilla.   
At this point you can either put them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator 
and save until you are ready to serve them, or serve immediately.
(Sometimes I warm them for a few seconds in the microwave to soften, other
times I serve cold). Cut into 1/2" slices before serving.  Can be dipped
into salsa.


	Crab Puffs
		1 pkg. wanton skins
		8 oz. cream cheese
		7 1/2 oz. crab
		2 tsp. soft breadcrumbs
		2 drops sesame oil

Combine all ingredients except skins.  Fill squares with 1 tsp. of the
mixture and fold over, making triangles.  Moisten to seal edges.  Fry
in oil heated to 370 F for 3 minutes, or until brown and puffed,
turning once.  Serve with Chinese mustard.


	Mexican Stuffed Mushrooms

		1 lb. hot sausage 
		1/3 c. soy sauce
		1 clove garlic
		2 lbs. LARGE mushrooms

Mix together the first 3 ingredients.  Stuff mushrooms.  Bake at 350 F
for 20 minutes or until sausage is done.


	Fresh Fruit Dip

		8 oz. cream cheese, softened
		1/2 c. lemon yogurt
		1/2 tsp. vanilla
		1/2 c. coconut, toasted
		3 tbl. milk

In a small mixer bowl beat together the cream cheese, lemon yogurt,
honey, and vanilla till smooth.  Stir in the coconut and milk.  Turn
into serving bowl.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator till cold.
Serve with slices of fresh fruit.



	Filo Dough Triangles

2 boxes (2 pounds) Filo pastry leaves
1 to 1+1/2 pounds unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
3 batches of FILLING(s) (see below)

Melt the butter.  Take a filo leaf, lay it out flat, and brush it
with melted butter.  Put another leaf on top of this one and butter
it as well.  Cut this into four long strips (the dough is usually
18x24, so when you cut it, you should get four 4.5x24 strips).  For
each strip, put a spoonful of filling at the top, and then flag-fold
the strip into a triangle with the filling inside.  Repeat until you
run out of either the filling or the filo leaves.

Slash the tops of the triangles -- be careful not to cut through to
the filling.

Bake these at 450 degrees F. for about twenty to twenty-five minutes.
(Basically, you just want to make them golden-brown.)


Roquefort-Leek filling

1/2 cup minced leeks (about two leeks)
3 tbsp butter
2 oz. Roquefort cheese
2/3 cup Ricotta cheese
1 egg-yolk
Salt and pepper if you want

Cut the green tops off the leeks;  discard.  Quarter the leeks down
their long axis, and rinse well in a pot of water.  Now mince finely.
Saut'e in the butter until tender.  Crumble the roquefort and mix in;
also stir in the ricotta.  If you really feel that you *must* add a
bit of salt, and you don't mind that it's going to ruin your blood
pressure, besides clogging your arteries with the cholesterol from
the butter and cheeses, (:-) then add some.  Same with the pepper. :-)

Mix well.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


Three-Cheese filling with Pepperoni

1/2 cup Ricotta cheese
3 tbsp grated mozzarella
3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan
1/4 cup very finely chopped pepperoni
1 egg yolk
Salt and pepper if you want

Mix everything together.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


Crab filling

8 oz. fresh crab meat
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp shallots, finely chopped
1 tbsp sherry
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper if you want

Melt butter, saut'e shallots until soft but not browned.  Add the crab and
sherry, saut'e or 30 seconds.  Stir in the rest, let cool.  Fills up about
24-30 triangles.


Curried Lamb filling

8 oz lean boneless lamb
3 tbsp butter
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 tsp curry powder
1/4 tsp ground coriander
a pinch of cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper if you want

Chop lamb into 1/4 inch pieces.  Melt 2 tbsp butter in a pan and brown
lamb over medium-high heat.  Move lamb to a bowl, and saut'e the onion,
garlic, curry, and coriander until soft.  Stir in lamb and season to
taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


MEXICAN APPETIZER

1 (8 oz) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 jar thick and chunky picante sauce
1/2 jar dried beef, chopped
8-10 flour tortilla shells
1 C cheese, grated
Paprika

Mix cream cheese, picante sauce and dried beef until creamy. (You may
chop the dried beef in a food processor, then add the other two
ingredients and mix.) Place one tortilla shell on serving dish and
spread with a layer of the mixture.  Repeat this process until you have
a stack of 8 to 10 tortilla shells with cream cheese layers between.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  Cut into wedges to
serve.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and paprika.  If desired, serve
with sour cream, guacamole, or extra picante sauce on the side.

The grated cheese can also be added to the cream cheese mixture rather
than sprinkled on top.


CRAB RANGOON

1 or 2 packages (8 ounces) Neufchatel cheese, softened (or cream cheese)
     {amount based on how "cheesy" you want them}
1 can (6 ounces) crab meat, drained and flaked
2 green onions including tops, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon lite soy sauce
1 package (48 count) won ton skins
vegetable spray coating

In medium bowl, combine all ingredients except won ton skins and spray
coating; mix until well blended. (To prevent won ton skins from drying
out, prepare one or two rangoon at a time.) Place 1 teaspoon filling in
center of each won ton skin. Moisten edges with water; fold in half to
form triangle, pressing edges to seal. Pull bottom corners down and
overlap slightly; moisten one corner and press to seal. Lightly spray
baking sheet with vegetable coating. Arrange rangoon on sheet and lightly
spray to coat. Bake in 425 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until
golden brown. Serve hot with sweet-sour sauce or mustard sauce. 

Makes 48 appetizers.
NOTE: Rangoon can also be fried in oil. 


Spicy Phyllo Cups

6 sheets phyllo pastry
1 T olive oil

Stack three sheets of phyllo dough on a work surface.  For cups, use a 
three inch round tart pan or mold to cut out circles, and then place 
the circles in 2 1/4" tart pans.  For boats, use a 4 1/2 x 2" boat-shaped 
tart mold as a guide and place the phyllo into 3 1/2 x 1 1/2" boat-shaped 
molds.  Cut out approximately 30 cups or boats.

Bake at 425 for 6-8 minutes.  They should be golden brown.  Remove carefully 
from the molds and cool on a wire rack.

Heat 1 T olive oil in a frying pan.  Cook onion over medium-low heat until 
soft but not browned (5-6 minutes).  Add the pine nuts the garlic, and the 
cumin, cardamom, cayenne, and cinammon.
Cook 2-3 minutes.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft.  Add raisins.
Transfer to a plate.

Heat 1 T olive oil in the frying pan.  Stir-fry the steak until it changes 
color.  Add the mushroom mixture and combine.  Season with pepper, and salt 
if desired.  Spoon filling into cups or boats.  Sprinkle with cut chives.
Serve warm.

Goat Cheese Spread
    6 cloves garlic (unpeeled)
    1 Tbsp olive oil
    1/2 Lb. fresh goat cheese (e.g. Montrachet)(any other suggestions??)
    1/3 C drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, cut julienne

    Preheat oven to 350 F.  Toss whole cloves with oil in heavy small
baking dish.  Bake until soft and brown, about 15 min.  Cool slightly. 
Slip skins off garlic; transfer to medium bowl and mash to paste.  Mix
in goat cheese and tomatoes.  Can be prepared 4 days ahead; refrigerate.
 Let stand 1 hr before serving.


Olive-Caper Spread

Spring-Fresh Hors d'ovres

Endive leaves, separated
Cream cheese plus another cheese for flavoring (roquefort, goat,
	gruyere, or other cheese of your choice)
Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley combination is nice)
Garlic powder (just a bit)
Fresh chives (leave in their lengthy state; don't chop)
Smoked salmon
Red bell pepper

Chop some fresh herbs and set aside.  Process together cream
cheese and second cheese of your choice.  Now cream together in
a bowl the cheese mixture, herbs, and a bit of garlic powder to
taste.  (You may also add some salt, white ground black pepper,
or even cayenne pepper if you like.)  Put into a pastry bag and
fit with an attractive piping attachment (I use the "scallop edge"
attachment).  Pipe the cheese in a line along the length of the
endive "boat".  Do this until all endive leaves or cheese mixture
is used.  Now top off each by placing on top of the piped cheese
length:  1 strand of chive (cut shorter as necessary), a bit of
minced red bell pepper, and a small strip of smoked salmon.
Place all "boats" on a lined cookie sheet, cover with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Very attractive
& quite artistic.


Sourdough Baguettes

A great little cafe in Reno (yeah, we don't all eat in casinos) serves
little sourdough baguette slices topped with, in order, cream cheese,
pesto sauce, and roasted red pepper slices, and its wild!!

My wife and I have made it a few times, and now that roasted red
peppers are readily available in jars from most supermarkets, it's a
pretty easy task. Just soften the cream cheese, spread a nice little
layer on the sourdough slice, then a dolop of your favorite pesto, and
a little slice of red pepper. People with an aversion to raw fish have
to be assured that the red pepper really is vegetal matter, and not
something of the sea, as it has an almost lox-like appearance.



	bacon and cream cheese stuffed mushrooms

8 oz. cream cheese, softened
4-6 strips of bacon, fried and crumbled; reserve fat
1 small onion, finely chopped
20-25 large mushrooms, stems removed
about 8 mushroom stems, finely chopped

saute onion and mushroom stems in bacon fat until tender. drain off excess
fat.  mix crumbled bacon, onion and stems with softened cream cheese until
the mixture is workable.

stuff each mushroom and bake at 350 deg. f for 10-15 minutes.
finish under the broiler just until tops are golden.


bstila - moroccan chicken/nut pie

brown 1/2 lb blanched almonds in a little oil until golden.  chop
coarsely or pound with a mortar and pestle.  add 1/2 tsp cinnamon
and (optionally) honey or sugar to sweeten to taste (anc adds none
but cites recipes calling for up to 1/2c sugar--i favor a little
honey as the contrast of the sweetness with the savory chicken is
part of the exotic appeal of the dish).  set aside.

heat 1 tbsp clarified butter and 1/3 cup butter in a large heavy 
pot.  add 1 minced medium onion and saute for a few minutes.  add 
chicken meat equivalent to about 1/2 chicken (e.g. two boneless 
breasts), cut in small pieces (as for a pot pie), along with:

1/2 tsp pepper
1 pinch saffron (or, per ongoing thread, 1/2 tsp turmeric)
1/2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 cup minced parsley
1/4 cup minced coriander (cilantro, chinese parsley)
salt to taste

simmer until the chicken is done.  beat 2 eggs and slowly stir them 
into the sauce.  remove from heat.

have ready phillo sheets, melted butter (at least 1/4 lb), and a pastry
brush.  select a shallow baking pan about 8" in diameter, such as an iron
skillet.  what you basically want to do is construct a pie by layering
the phillo sheets in the pan and then folding them over the contents; it
will probably be easiest if you cut the sheets in half or smaller, for
instance into long rectangles about the width of the pan and twice as long.
brush one of the sheets with melted butter, and put it, butter side up,
in the bottom of the pan, the excess dangling over the side.  add another
sheet, at an angle to the first, and repeat so that you have phillo
covering the bottom of the pan and dangling out all around (this is hard
to describe).  use about 5 sheets to form this layer.  repeat the process,
forming another layer.  now pour the chicken and sauce into the pan.  put
several more buttered sheets on top of the chicken, this time not
overlapping the edge--use smaller pieces or fold them in half.  spread
the nut mixture on top of this.  put another layer or so of phillo, then
fold the dangling ends over the top so as to close the envelope.  (your
mileage may vary on the number and details of layering the sheets).  brush
the top with butter.  at this point the bstila can be refrigerated if
desired (this is time-consuming and you may wish to do all this the day
before serving).

just before serving, put the pan in a 350-degree oven for 15-20 minutes
until the top is golden: flip it onto an oven-proof plate (or use an
ordinary plate to flip it over back into the skillet) and return to brown
the other side, 30-40 minutes total.  place on a serving platter, sprinkle
with powdered sugar, then make fanciful decorative designs with ground
cinnamon.  (when i had this in a restaurant it said something like "eat
me").

1 chicken
salt, fresh black pepper
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
pinch of saffron
a tablespoon of mixed herbs or "bouquet garni"
3 large onions, peeled and minced
3 tablespoons oil
1/2 cup butter, margarine or diet margarine, clarified
7 eggs beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped cilantro or parsley
2 cups ground toasted almonds
1 tablespoon cinnamon
12 filo dough sheets
1/4 cup powdered sugar.

place chicken in a roasting pan.  if you use saffron threads, let them soak
in half a cup of water.  pour on fowl.  sprinkle salt, pepper, turmeric and
mixed herbs on top.  roast chicken in oven at 400 f for 45 minutes to an
hour.  cool.  remove skin and all bones.  cube chicken.  keep giblets,

and chopped cilantro.  place in another small bowl.  still in the same oiled
skillet, toast almonds until slightly brown and grind them in a food
processor.  set aside.

clarify the shortening, and everything is ready to be put together now.

on the bottom of the pan used to roast the chicken, after washing and
greasing it, stack 2 sheets of filo dough, letting edges overhang.  brush on
top some of the clarified shortening.  at broil, rapidly brown these 2
sheets.  then add cubed chicken, with all spices and juice.  spread again 2
more dough sheets with some shortening brushed on.

broil rapidly.  add soft mixture of eggs with cilantro.  cover with 2 more
greased sheets.  broil rapidly.  add almonds mixed with cinnamon and sugar.

one for hot and cold meat or fish nibbles, one for bread and cheese,
one for vegetable, and one fruit and desert.  then i may set out seasoned
popcorn, nuts, or wine crackers in small bowls around the room for
"instant gratification." i also have a "serve yourself" bar for
drinks of whatever kind i'm serving, usually a not-too-sweet punch
and soda, with wine or beer. (an excellent and pretty nonalcoholic punch
can be made with white grape juice, a good gingerale like canada dry or
schweppes, and a little pomegranate juice. to spike it, add brandy
to taste. if you like it sweeter, use framboise instead of the
pomegranate juice. or try creme de cassis.) in the winter, i may
make some mulled wine or cider.



Title: Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp
 
 
8    oz. Canadian-style bacon, cut in 12 slices
12  med. shrimp, shelled and deveined
1   med. red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 12 strips
1 1/2 T. low-sodium teriyaki sauce (I'd use regular)
1 1/2 T. low-sodium chili sauce (" " ")
1     T. hoisin sauce
 
1. Place bacon on rack; cover with paper towel.  Microwave on High 1
minutes; pat dry on paper towel.  Let cool slightly.
 
2. Wrap one shrimp and one pepper strip in each piece of bacon; secure
with wooden pick.  Place in 11x7" baking dish.
 
3. In small bowl, combine the teriyaki, chili and hoisin sauces with 2
T. water; pour over shrimp.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, turning
once.
 
4. Uncover and microwave on High 3-4 minutes, until shrimp is cooked
through.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
 

Chevre, Pear, Prosciutto, and Walnuts in Filo Bundles

3 pears, peeled, cored, and diced
12 oz. chevre
2 oz. prosciutto, sliced very thinly and julienned
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 tbl sage or pineapple sage, minced
1 pkg filo dough
1 cup butter, liquid
1 cup cream
garnish: chopped chives, 1 star fruit, 1 cucumber

Combine diced pears, 8 oz. chevre, julienned prosciutto, chopped walnuts,
and minced sage in a bowl. This is the filling.

Cut filo sheets in half so they are roughly square. You will use three
sheets, or six half sheets per serving, but you'd better count to be
sure you have enough. Lightly butter the bottoms of eight custard cups
or ramekins and place on a sheet pan. Lay six half-sheets, buttered with
a brush, over each other in a messy, offset pattern. Ease into a custard
cup. Repeat for all eight custard cups. Divide the filling among the
cups, placing it in the filo dough, and then twisting the tops into a
bundle over the filling. Brush the top lightly with butter. Bake the
bundles in a 350'F oven until nicely browned and the inside is hot,
about 20 minutes.

Combine 4 oz. chevre with 1 cup cream over moderate heat. Stir
vigorously to make the mixture smooth and reduce until the sauce coats a
spoon.

To serve, divide the sauce among eight salad-sized plates. Tilt the
plates to make the sauce evenly coat the inner area of the plate. Ease
the filo bundles out of the custard cups by loosening the edges with a
knife and then lifting it out with a spoon. Place a filo bundle in the
center of each plate.

Optional garnish: Sprinkle snipped chives on the sauce on the bottom half of
the plate. On the top half of the plate, place a thin slice of star fruit
on the right and a cucumber fan on the left.

See any book on garnishing for cucmber fan instructions. A cucumber fan is
made by slicing a cucumber in half lengthwise, cutting grooves in the skin
with a citrus zester/groove tool, and then making four thin slices cut at
a 45' angle, but held together in one corner. The fan is mooshed on to
the plate to make an ornamental fan. If you have a very sharp knife and a
steady hand, it's really quite easy.

                CRISP SAUTEED MUSHROOMS 


1 # large whole fresh mushrooms
these mushrooms must be absolutely fresh and the caps should
not be separating from the stems.

brush off mushrooms and slice into 1/4" slices from the
top down, including the stems.

with a fine mist spray bottle, mist the mushrooms to just barely
dampen.

drop into a paper bag or large ziplock bag that contains 1 or 2 cups
of a/p flour.  stir well or shake very gently.  then, let the mushrooms
"marinate" for a while in the flour while you prepare to cook them.

in a large, well seasoned cast-iron skillet or a commercial quality non-
stick skillet melt 1/2 stick of fresh unsalted butter and ~1/4 cup of
olive oil.  mix the oils well and heat to ~300-325 degrees.

drop the mushrooms into a colander to remove excess flour.  drop a few
at a time into the butter/oil and coat each well.  continue 'til all the
mushrooms are in the skillet.  turn down the heat to the saute level
and continue to cook, turning frequently.  after a few minutes add salt
and pepper to taste.

continue to cook until the degree of crispness is achieved.

my neighbor used to cook these for a long time, rendering nearly all the
moisture out of the mushrooms.  the finished product would be the most
delicate, and crisp mushrooms used as a side vegetable.



                   pate a chou (profiteroles)
 
1/2 c. water                       1/2 c flour
1/4 c. butter                      3 eggs
 
     place water and butter in a medium saucepan, heat until
water boils and the butter is melted. remove from the heat and
dump in the flour all at once.  stir vigorously until the flour
mixture forms an elastic ball in the saucepan. let the dough
mixture cool, and then beat in an egg until it is fully
incorporated into the dough mixture.  repeat the process with
each of the remaining eggs, beating them into the dough, one at a
time. 
     place the dough in the refrigerator to cool, for at least 45
minutes to 1 hour.  this will stiffen the dough, so it will not
flatten when baked into puffs or profiteroles.  
     when ready to bake, preheat oven to a hot 475 degrees f. 
using a couple of teaspoons, scoop small (large walnut sized)
mounds of dough on a greased cookie sheet.  place cookie sheet in
the hot oven for 10 minutes.  then reduce the heat to 325 degrees
f. and continue baking for an additional 25 - 30 minutes, or till
puffs are a medium brown color.  the puffs must remain in the
oven for the full baking time, or they will collapse soon after
being taken from the oven.  
     after cooling, the tops may be removed with a sharp knife,
any remaining uncooked dough may be removed from the inside, and
the puffs may be filled with any appetizer filling or desert
filling desired.
     this recipe makes approximately 18 puffs.

     

                profiteroles a la reine
          puffs with tarragon-flavored chicken

2 tbs. butter                  1/4 tsp. grated nutmeg
2 tbs. flour                   cayenne pepper, pinch
1/2 c. chicken broth           2 tsp. chopped fresh tarragon, or 
1/2 c. heavy cream                    1 tsp. dried.
salt, if desired               1 1/2 c. leftover chicken, cut into cubes
black pepper, to taste         24 cream puffs
 
     melt the butter in a medium saucepan, add the flour, stirring with a 
wire whisk.  when blended, add the broth, stirring rapidly with the whisk.
when it is thickened, stir in the cream, and stir til blended.  add the
salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne and tarragon.  let simmer, stirring, for
about 2 minutes.  stir in the chicken and bring to a boil. remove from
the stove. this should have a very thick consistency.  if it is not thick
enough, it may be further thickened by the addition of a small amount of flour
dissolved in water or broth, and stirred into the mixture while being heated, 
until it thickens.
    slice off the tops of the cream puffs.  spoon an equal amount of the 
chicken mixture into each puff.  replace the tops and serve.  these may be 
made up an hour or two in advance, and reheated before serving in a 
slow (325 degree) oven, or for a few seconds in a microwave.  do not
make them up too far in advance, since the puff casings will tend to
get soggy.



             profiteroles aux crevettes a l'indienne

     slice off the tops from all the cream puffs.  spoon an equal portion
of the shrimp mixture into each cream puff.  replace the tops and serve.



Chicken Ravioli in Port Mustard Creme Sauce with Mango Ginger Chutney

serves 4 as a pasta dish before the main meal.

Pasta

	1 cup flour
	1 egg
	1 tbl water
	1 tbl olive oil (gives gummy texture)

	prepare two sheets of pasta rolled out to "6" on the Atlas machine.
	You can knead by hand forever or use a food processor on the dough.

Egg wash

	1 egg
	2 tbl water

	whisk together and brush on one side of each piece of pasta. The
	egg wash acts as a glue to hold the ravioli together during
	cooking.

Filling

	6 oz. cooked chicken (Chef Johnson called for smoked)
	1/6 cup cream
	1/4 cup mango ginger chutney (buy from your grocery store!)

	Combine in food processor, or chop chicken finely with knife and
	mix together. (Chef Johnson called for some cayenne and more
	chutney, but I cut it down to my taste because I thought it was
	too spicy.)

Prepare ravioli by putting 1-1 1/2 tsp lumps of chicken filling on
one piece of pasta in a 2xN matrix where N is ~10-12. Place other piece of
pasta over this. Egg side of both sheets should be toward the inside. Cut
ravioli with a knife or a ravioli wheel. Seal ravioli with fingers or
by pressing with a fork. Flour well and set aside.

You should make 20-24 ravioli. You will need 16 to serve. Expect a few
to fall apart while cooking.

When sauce is ready, cook ravioli until they rise.

Sauce

	1 cup port wine
	8 peppercorns, bruised or cracked
	1 bay leaf
	2 shallots, diced

	Reduce over high heat until nearly dry.

	1 cup chicken stock

	Add and reduce until total volume is about 1/4 cup.

	1 cup cream
	1 tbl mustard

	Add, whisk, and reduce until sauce naps. (Napping means: dip a
	spoon in the sauce, wipe the back horizontally with your finger.
	If the sauce does not run it is thick enough.)

	Strain the sauce and keep warm. (Strained sauces come from
	French tradition. You want a smooth pretty sauce with no chunks
	of pepper and lumps of shallots.)

	I adjusted the proportions in this recipe from Chef Johnson's
	original. I used less cream and more port because I like the
	greater flavor and color from the port.

Prepare four individual plates. On each plate, pour an equal portion of
the sauce. Makes sure the sauce coats the entire center of the plate but
none of the side. Place four cooked ravioli on the place, and scoop
about 2 tbl of the chutney on the middle of the plate. It should look very
pretty.

What sort of wine would go with this course? I've had it with a
Chardonnay and with a German Riesling. In both cases, the ginger, etc.,
overpowered the wine. Perhaps an Alsatian Gewurztraminer would do
better, or perhaps this course just isn't suited to wine. :-(


Baba Ghanoush / Eggplant with Tahini


3 large eggplants
2-4 cloves garlic, or to taste
Salt
1/2 c tahini or less, depending on size of eggplants
juice of 3 lemons, or more to taste
1/2 t ground cumin (optional)
2 T finely chopped parsley
A few black olives or 1 tomato, thinly sliced, to garnish

Cook the eggplants over charcoal or under a gas or electric 
broiler (sear until skins are black and start to blister with
the flesh soft and juicy, rub skins off under cold water taking
care to remove any charred particles, then gently squeeze out as
much of the bitter juice as possible).  

Crush the garlic cloves with salt.  Mash the eggplants with a
potato masher or fork, then add the crushed garlic and a little
more salt, and pound to a smooth, creamy puree.  Alternatively,
use an electric blender to make the puree.

Add the tahini and lemon juice alternatively, beating well or
blending for a few seconds between each addition.  Taste and add
more salt, lemon juice, garlic, or tahini if you think it is
necessary, and if you like, a little cumin.

Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes.
Garnish with finely chopped parsley and black olives, or with
a few tomato slices.  Serve as an appetizer with Arab or other
bread, as a salad, or as a party dip.

2 tablespoons uncooked rice
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
salt to taste
lemon juice (1/2 lemon)
1 1/2 cups water

Trim the leeks.  Remove a few of the outer layers.  Slice 3/4 inch 
thich; discard the tough green leaves.  Wash several times in plenty

PHYLLO CHEESE PASTRIES

1 lb muenster cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 TB chopped parsley
1 lb frozen phyllo dough
2 sticks melted butter

Grate the muenster cheese finely in a food processor or with a hand grater.
Add eggs and parsley and blend well.

Remove the phyllo dough from the freezer
and gently unroll.  With a sharp knife, slice dough into thirds,
lengthwise, so that each is approximately 4" x 12".  Re-wrap two thirds of
the dough in plastic and return to the freezer.

Tear a large piece of wax paper and place on counter.  Working quickly,
take one sheet of phyllo dough and brush liberally with butter.  Top with
two more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.  Place approximately
1 TB of cheese mixture at one end of the buttered sheets, 1 inch from the
edge.  With your fingers, roll the dough over the cheese mixture twice.
Fold in the edges of the dough and continue rolling tightly until the end.
(Be careful not to tear the dough or roll too loosely, otherwise the cheese
will spill out when baking).
Place
seam side down on a cookie sheet and brush tops with butter.  Repeat with
remaining phyllo sheets.  Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes
or until golden and crispy.

MUSHROOM-BACON PATE - PARTY PATE WITHOUT LIVER


     2 lbs     fresh mushrooms, chopped very fine
     1/2 lb    bacon (or more, to taste)
     2/3 cup   onion, chopped very fine
     2/3 cup   celery, chopped very fine
     8 oz      cream cheese, at room temperature
     4         eggs
     1/2 cup   parsley, chopped very fine
     2 cups    dry bread crumbs
     1 tsp     salt
     1 tsp     dried rosemary
     1 tsp     dried oregano
     1/4 tsp   ground black pepper

          (1)  Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible.
               Reserve some of the grease.

          (2)  Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery, and parsley as
               fine as possible.  A food processor works best,
               but you can do it by hand if need be.

          (3)  Saute the onion and celery in the bacon grease
               until soft, then remove from the grease, and
               drain.

          (4)  Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and
               then beat in the eggs.  Add all other ingredients
               to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix thoroughly.

          (5)  Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with
               foil, and then grease the foil.  Pat the mixture
               into the loaf pan and cover loosely with foil.
               Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 400 deg. F.

          (6)  Let cool completely before serving.

NOTES
     This pate is actually best when refrigerated before serving.
     Serve with crackers, or with bread cut into shapes with
     cookie cutters.

     To make this a more elegant buffet dish, garnish the top
     with a thin layer of aspic.

     

Lumpias 

1 10 Oz Can Water Chestnuts Drained and Minced
2 Eggs
1 Tsp Black Pepper
1 Bunch Green Onions, Minced
2 Yellow Chili Peppers, Minced
1/2 Tsp Salt
1 Tsp Minced Garlic
1Lb Ground Pork
1 Package Mu Shu Pork Wrappers
An egg and 1 Tbl Flour Mixed together in a small bowl
Chili Sauce

Combine the first eight ingredients and mix thoroughly. With a wrapper
on a plate in front of you, put about 1 tbl meat on a corner as though
you were going to wrap the meat up in a piece of butcher paper. Using
your fingers, pinch the meat into a cylinder. Bring the lower corner up
over the meat, wrap the sides in, and roll the meat up around the rest
of the wrapper. Secure the edge of the wrapper by using the egg mixture
as glue. Deep fry the lumpias until crispy and golden brown. Serve at
once with chili sauce.


Roasted Garlic

1 head of garlic
Butter and fresh thyme (optional)

Using a sharp knife, cut the pointed top off the garlic
head so that the cloves are just visible through the
cuts in the top of the garlic.  Several hours before serving,
put the garlic in the oven at 250 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
Remove and let cool.

Just before serving, put the garlic on a heatproof serving
dish; garnish with butter and crossed sprigs of fresh thyme,
if desired.  Heat oven to 450 degrees and roast garlic for
5-10 minutes, or until brown all across the top.  Serve while
still warm.

To serve: We use cocktail forks (gotta have some use for the
silly things) to scoop out the cloves of garlic from the head.
Then you mash them on warm French bread.  The appetizer last
night included a wedge of herb Brie next to the head of garlic,
and the combination was very nice.
