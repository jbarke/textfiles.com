(?)
1/2 cup finely chopped        1 onion chopped fine
celery (leaves, too)
1 potato in small dice        1 bay leaf  (don't eat the
                              bay leaf!)
1 mashed garlic clove         FAT PINCH of oregano
1 dash of cayenne pepper      1 pound shark fillets, cut
                              in 1-inch pieces
1 cup of okra

Chop up the tomatoes and simmer the shebang except the fish
for about 20 minutes to cook the vegetables, then add the
shark and okra and simmer another 10 minutes to cook it
through.

Comments:
But in my packing frenzy I came across a bedraggled recipe
from a local store that I'm going to try the next time I see
SHARK in the market.  It looks pretty good, and could
probably be done with halibut or tuna (the fillet version,
not the canned junk), or any really firm-fleshed fish.
(coelacanth?? ;> )
Serve this low calorie treat with salt, pepper and Tabasco
sauce at the table. Plan on sorbet for dessert to cool the
tongue.
