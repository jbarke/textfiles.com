Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix         1 large can crushed
                              pineapple with juice
1 cup sugar                   2 small packages instant
                              vanilla pudding mix
1 pkg. frozen coconut         1 large container Cool Whip
(optional                     or equivalent

Instructions:
Bake cake as directed on box in greased and floured 9 x 13
inch pan. Heat pineapple and sugar until sugar is dissolved.
Punch holes in cake while still hot and pour pineapple-sugar
mixture over cake. Refrigerate until cool.  Mix pudding as
directed on package and spread over cake. If using coconut,
sprinkle some on cake at this point. Mix rest of coconut
with Cool Whip and spread on cake.  Cake must be kept
refrigerated.

Comments:
The one time I made this cake, I was exceptionally under-
whelmed by it.  My main complaints were it was way too
sweet, plus the pudding overflowed when I poured it over top
of the cake.
Changes I'd make if I made this again: I'd make the cake
from scratch, leave out the cup of sugar, use unsweetened
pineapple.  Then I'd make the pudding from scratch (and use
a smaller amount!) and use unsweetened fresh whipped cream.
Oh, you can also try different flavors and combinations of
cake and pudding mixes if you like.
