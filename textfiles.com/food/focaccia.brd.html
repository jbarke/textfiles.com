Comments:
This is a great focaccia recipe from a local deli here in
Connecticut:
NOTE: Try these herb combinations (fresh or dried): basil;
lemon-rosemary; lemon-chive; lemon-basil; fennel-lemon or
orange; crushed red pepper and oregano; chopped olives and
rosemary; olives and sun-dried tomatoes; or your own combo.
I used a variety of Italian seasonings and used this dough
as a pizza crust.  It was incredible!
