Quantity:

Ingredients:
2 cans anchovies                 (drain the oil off of
                              these)
2 sticks of butter            4 buds of garlic (or
                              whatever)  <--(my family
                              really likes garlic)

Instructions:
  Brown these all together for 8-10 minutes.  Add 1/2 pt.
whipping cream and  3/4 pt. half-and-half.  Add the rest of
the cream as it thickens.  Mix and   enjoy.

Comments:
  Serving:  Grandma says you dip veggies in the mixture (she
recommends celery and/or cabbage (pickled mushrooms?)) and
then eat it, using Italian bread to catch the drips.  My
grandfather just puts his bread in the stuff, but my grandma
says her father would have shot them for doing that.
That's about all I know, since I don't eat it myself.  Hope
that helped.
