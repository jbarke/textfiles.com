Quantity: (2 loaves)

Ingredients:
  1 cup (2 sticks) butter,      1 1/3 cups packed brown
softened but not melted       sugar
  3 eggs                        2 tsp. vanilla  plus 1/4
                              tsp. almond extract
  1 tsp. grated orange rind   
Sift together twice:          
  2 cups whole wheat flour      2 cups white flour
  1 tsp. salt                   1/2 tsp. baking soda
  3 tsp. baking powder          1/4 tsp. nutmeg
2 tsp. cinnamon               
Also need:                    
  1 1/2 cups mashed ripe        2/3 cups black coffee
banana pureed with            (honest, it's tasty!)

Instructions:
Beat in large bowl, beginning with sugar or honey and
butter, add eggs one at a time.  Add remaining ingredients
and beat till light in color:     Add flour mixture and
banana stuff alternately to the butter mixture, beginning
and ending with flour (flour-banana-flour-banana-flour).
After each addition mix gently to combine, but do not beat
or otherwise overmix--this toughens and dries a cake.  Add
nuts and raisins last if you want them.  Generously butter 2
loaf pans and sprinkle with sesame seeds (they'll stick to
the butter).  Divide batter and bake at 350 F. for 40-50
minutes or until done.  Cool 10 minutes in the pan then
remove to wire rack to finish cooling.
