Ingredients:
1 lb. button mushrooms        8 small to medium zucchini
1/4 cup wine vinegar          2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt               2 sprigs fresh tarragon
1/4 cup water                 1/4 cup dry white wine


Instructions:
Clean the mushrooms.  Cut the zukes into 1 inch lengths.
Place all ingredients in a pot.  Simmer until the zukes are
just tender.  Turn off heat.  Place lid on pot and leave for
15 minutes.  Place the drained vegetables in a bowl,
reserving the cooking liquid.  Place this liquid back in the
pot and cook until reduced to about 1/3 cup. Discard the
tarragon.  Pour over the vegetables and lightly chill (don't
over-chill or it will kill the flavor).

Comments:
Throw on a little finely chopped parsley before serving.
