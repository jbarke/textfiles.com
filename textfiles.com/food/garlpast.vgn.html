Garlic Pasta
Category: Vegetarian:  No meats, etc...
Posted by:     Scratcher
Quantity: Serves 4-6.

Ingredients:
1/2 lb. pasta (uncooked)      
6-8 cloves of garlic          3 T olive oil
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream  salt
(half and half can be
substituted)
pepper                        parmesan or romano cheese

Instructions:
Slice garlic very thin and sauté in the olive oil until not
quite brown (it gets bitter if it gets too browned). I
sometimes throw in some oregano or red pepper at this stage.
Add whipping cream a little salt and ample pepper and lower
the heat a little.                 Reduce liquid by
simmering a few minutes. Toss with the pasta. (Cook it while
you're making the sauce!) Grate as much cheese onto the
pasta as you desire. Eat up!

Comments:
This is a very good vegetarian pasta recipe, but it's
certainly not low cal. Also, it's not vegan so I hope you're
not of that persuasion.   Compliments of the Frugal Gourmet.
This is really easy and yummy! I often use rainbow, curly
pasta -- it traps the pieces of garlic nicely. Oh, and you
should try to use fresh parmesan cheese if you can because
this loses something with the Kraft stuff. I know it's
expensive, but it's much better in the long run and really
worth it.
