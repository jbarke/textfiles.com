in the lour, and cook slowly, stirring, until the butter and flour froth
together for 2 minutes without colouring.  (This mixture is called a roux.)

pour in all of the hot liquid at once.  Immediatly beat vigorously with the wire
wisk to blend the liquid with the roux, gather in all the bits of roux from the
