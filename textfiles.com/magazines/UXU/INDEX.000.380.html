100: "A Year With uXu" by The Chief.   A brief look on the year that
has passed along with uXu releases. The short uXu history you might
call it. Seemed appropriate to write when the no. one hundred file
was to be released.

101: "Sex!" by The GNN.   Now what you expect from the title, but
it does have to do with the content in a way. Sex sex sex, is that
ALL you think about? Good! Then this file is for you. Why not do
what everyone else is doing? This one will show you how!

102: "Meaning Of Life" by The GNN.   When you discover THE meaning
of life. When you know why you do the things you do, why the human
race behaves like it does, and why boiling tea is hot, what happens?
Will you go nuts when you discover the truth. Only the brave will
ever know..

103: "Vampires Anno 90's" by The GNN.   If Dracula decided to make
a comeback today, who would believe it? Would You listen if someone
tried to warn you? Here's the story about the Dracula of today.
The modern Dracula.

104: "Church Of The Re(A)listic" by The GNN.   A realistic church?
Get real! What has caused more war than anything else on this earth?
What has made people do crazy and often lethal things more than
anything else? You guessed it! But why, and what can we do about it?
Here's a thought.

105: "uXu Index #9" by The Chief.   Better late than never, right?
YES we do live! Rumors? All lies! It's not true! Not true I say! <g>.
As you might expect (expect?) you'll find the regular sections in
the index, with new information and generalabelia.

106: "What Do You Think About Bleed?" by The GNN.   People seem
to criticize good, well-written up-your-face games these days.
How dumb! Don't you think? Yeah, so read what Brad Nixon NYPD
has to say to the non-believers, right here!

107: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Dopplegänger" by The Chief.   The Chief's
absolute favorites. Here with the lyrics to their latest album
'Dopplegänger'. If you haven't heard of Curve, you haven't
experienced life!

108: "Dental Torture" by The GNN.   Shame on you! Afraid of
going to the dentist? Ha! Ehm.. Well.. dentalphobia could
happen to anyone. The GNN lets you know what a nightmare
a visit to the dentists could be.

109: "Clean Shaven Beauty II" by Ralph 124C41+.   If you could
write a sequel to what has been labeled 'un-sequelable', you
know what to expect. Yet another classic, mind-bending short
story by Ralph.

110: "The Civilized Primitive Prowler" by The GNN.   A schizophrenic
story by The GNN to complete this set of files, and give you
the maximum joy. I won't say anything about the contents,
because this is a file NOT TO BE MISSED. Another GNN Classic.

111: "Now It Can Be Told - uXu Members Speaks Out" by ALL.   Last
release, you were presented with a short tale about the year
uXu has been active by The Chief. Now the other members speaks
out, letting you know their side of the story. Uncensored
of course.

112: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Pubic Fruit" by The Chief.   Now, if
you STILL haven't heard of Curve, you didn't read some of the
last file-descriptions! So, go back, and read it through, again
and again until.. Seriously, this is the lyrics to the compilation
Curve released at the end of 1992. Just unsinkable!

113: "uXu Lyrics: Slowdive - Just For a Day" by The Chief.   Yes,
it's another lyrics file. (There are a few this time aren't there?)
Slowdive lyrics, here from their 'Just For a Day' album released
last year. Another Chief favorite.

114: "Elite Modemtraders" by The GNN.   If you collect all eLyTE
modemtraders in a house, blow it up, and jump on the pieces,
would they disappear? Yeah, of course. They're too gullible
to even suspect someone tricking them. Check what The GNN did
to 'em.

115: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter One" by The Chief.   
The sequel? But the first series isn't finished yet!? You're
right. This is the serious series with Castle set in a future
no one could imagine. The Non-humor-series. Read the end-comment
in file 115 to get the complete explanation.

116: "uXu Index #10" by The Chief.   I don't think you need an
introduction to the Index-file anymore. Or do you? Perhaps we have
a couple of new readers, perhaps someone actually enjoy reading
about the index in the index itself? Hmm.. ok then.. back to normal.
As you might know, you'll find the regular sections in the index,
with new information and general statistics.

117: "The Missionary Man" by The GNN.   Our twisting-ends meister
smokes you into this eleventh release with a story only inches
away from your face. His views on life in general marks this one
as well as it does in his other work.

118: "I O U" by Phearless.   This is not for the weak. This is not
for the inexperienced one. Phearless makes a tough comback with a
story that'll make you bleed and never forget. Hard-core for the
fans out there.

119: "...As If Every Day..." by The GNN.   What can create something
so terrible, so unpredictable, that you'll face your maker even
though you're not sick, even though it's not an accident and even
though it's not suicide? Read on.

120: "Pleasurehouse Interview" by The Chief.   One of the best 
Swedish indie bands played live at a local place, and yours truly,
couldn't miss that opportunity to do an interview with the members
of the band. Something for the indie-mates out there, for sure.

121: "Perpetum Mobile - Three Poems" by The GNN.   Three poems in
a collection from The GNN. 'Ice', 'The Price To Pay' and 'Perpetum
Mobile'. Some of the best poems from uXu in fact, and not to be
missed.

122: "uXu Lyrics: Suredo, Pleasurehouse & A Shrine" by The Chief.
More lyrics! This time from the three best Swedish Indie bands
right now. Independent fans - you'll find yourself at home with
uXu.. we're sure independent.

123: "The Open Road Towards The Future" by The GNN.   Now, here
and alive. That's what you are, isn't it? Do you care about
anything? Do you value your right to live the way you do?
Questions. An answer? Why worry.

124: "Everything's Gonna Be Alright..." by Phearless.   Yes,
Phearless with another fantastic file. One that is different
from what we're used to see from him. One that is grabbing your
brain from every direction. Car-ness.

125: "They Are Coming" by The GNN.   If you heard that they were
coming, would you greet them with a smile, or would you be worried
they'd blow everyone away? You'd have to chose, you'd have to see
the reality.

126: "Why?" by The GNN.   What are you wearing? What are you doing?
Who told you to do your homework? Who even told you to got to school?
WHY are you doing all these things, when you know what you really
want to do? Why?

127: "uXu Index #11" by The Chief.   The index. The foundation to
an entire collection of text files. Isn't that nice. Hehe, kind of
self-important statement isn't it? Yeah, so forget it. As you
surely know, you find the regular sections in the index, plus new
information and general statistics.

128: "Als Sprach The GNN - Ten Topics" by The GNN.   Our brain surgeon
hits the crowd again with some mind-bending thoughts about life, the
way we know it, as it is today. Could he be right this time? Of course
he could. See what You think and pick up this piece of work.

129: "The Anatomy Of Boredom" by Ralph 124C41+.   This release really
marks somewhat of a similar cause. Ralph writes here about boredom,
why, why not, and what boredom have made possible all the way through
the dawn of the human race. Another thinker for y'all.

130: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter Two" by The Chief.   True,
this makes me sick! "Lets have some action here, lets make it more 
cYbERpunK!" they said. Why? Why can't it develop along the lines that
were drawn up from the start? "They won't read it." they said. Well,
why didn't you say so in the first place? ssssnyderflunk you said?

131: "Dream On" by Ralph 124C41+.   One man, trapped, but not in a
place he didn't want to be - now how is that possible? Well, when
you're desperate, feeling really low, you only have one place where
you can control your surroundings. Right.

132: "The House Of The Criminally Insane" by The GNN.   What treatment
could possibly help those who are criminally insane, you ask? Hmm,
there is a better way for you to learn the answer to that question
and that is to read this cute, but really ground-shaking text.

133: "The Twelve Miscellaneous Facts About Life" by The Chief.   Two
minutes of your time, is all I ask. Just read through this, now old
but unused file found in the depths of our archives and see what
you think. Dontcha agree wit' da chief? Oh well.

134: "The Last Night Of The World" by The GNN.   Now? TODAY? What
would you do if you found out that this what the last night of
your life. Everyone's life? What would the rest of the world do
when that day came? What would happen?! HELP!

135: "Death Is Rotten" by Ralph 124C41+.   Yes, you say. Perhaps it is,
after a while. So what do we do about it? Is there a way we can go
to live longer? Here's a little story of a man who found a way, though
I don't think it is the way he wanted it to be...

136: "Live On Stage Again: Messiah!" by The GNN.   If He came to visit
you, what would you say? What would you do? What if, now this is just
a thought, what if He was just like you? The GNN brings him back again
to the scene, to explain a few things.

137: "uXu Index #12" by The Chief.   Twelve of these and you really
have the life of uXu in your hands. The index isn't something to be
thrown away! No Sir! It leaves you with a history. And every new one
gives you new sections, plus new information and general statistics.

138: "The Last Frontier" by The GNN.   A rational statement trying to
see through the government's interest in the wide area networks of
today. A couple of answers to questions if this is good or bad, and
what will probably happen in the near future is presented here.

139: "Letters To The State" by Anon. Contributors.   This one was
sent to uXu through an anonymous mail-address, to be published with
this release. It's a story of lies, "dangerous people with computers",
informers and the police.

140: "The Killing Truth" by The GNN.   The truth can be fatal, we all
know that. But how fatal can it be? If you knew, would you care, or
would something else happen to you? Do you dare to know?

141: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Radio Sessions" by The Chief.   One of the
best Curve collections out on the market today. Their Peel sessions
are better and differs from the originals. You a Curve fan? Scope
this one out.

142: "The Lynch Mob" by The GNN.   Crisis, governments, scape-goats,
refugees, anarchists and the 'normal' people. The GNN corrects the
picture on the wall with yet another insightful look under the
magnifying glass on how the world works. Do you believe?

143: "Prometheus Symptom" by The GNN.   Creeping fiction from the
meister himself. Knowledge, power and pain. People say knowledge
is power. At least right now.

144: "Vengeance!" by Hedge.   Now there's a new name in the game.
Hedge presents himself with a story that might just not be fiction
at all. Or is it? The guilty ones know for sure.

145: "Rage!" by The GNN.   Yes, Rage. Will you put up with anything?
What do you do when someone tells you to go to hell? Do you do that
then? I don't think so. What do you do when someone tells you to do
something? Depends on who it is, right? The police?

146: "The Power" by The GNN.   If you read GNN's last, really popular
one called 'Meanwhile', you will love this one. And it is so true,
so true. You'll get the message.

147: "uXu Index #13" by The Chief.   Perhaps the index isn't needed
anymore? What do You think? Let me know! E-Mail me with your comments
and we'll head the way you turn us to. Though we've got one for this
release doesn't mean there aren't any new sections, new information,
and general statistics.

148: "Technophilia" by Ikonoklast.   The book on the computer underground
as we know it today. If you haven't read this one already, you better
grab a copy and get a grip on the underground. Everything from Hackers
to Raves, from Mind machines and Virtual Reality to Nootropics. Grab this
one or you're crazy!

149: "The Art Of Weirdness" by Bob Slack.   This one is the first from
Bob under the uXu label. It gives you some ideas on what to do while
online someplace if you're not weird enough already. You'll get far by
following his short but useful tips.

150: "Declare War!" by The GNN.   The computer underground is a
somewhat vulnerable scene these days. People get busted every day
and, it seems, for everything. This is no longer a game like it
was a few years ago. This is war.

151: "Hackers Against The Govt's New World Order" by FreeStyle.   One
of our new contributors presents you with a in-depth discussion on
what the government is really all about. Control. And what can we do
about it? The computer underground can't do shit, you say? Wrong.
Read on.

152: "Settle For Nothing" by The Chief.   The topic of large egos
once again. More in a general view of relationships this time though
and how to act/what to do (perhaps) to make that relationship hold
or fold. You decide if you want to try. I wouldn't.

153: "A Day For Tired People" by The GNN.   Feeling tired and bored
on sundays huh? Feeling like you're doing everything like you've always
done it, without change? Well, here's a little story for you that'll
probably make you think a bit. No no, it's fiction. :)

154: "Suicidal Maniac's Shitty File" by Suicidal Maniac.   Now here's
someone who promised us a file _a long_ time ago. And you know what?
He kept his promise! Even though he disappeared from the online world
for almost a year. Amazing. Well, what are you waiting for? Get it!

155: "Ripmax Top Tenners" by Ripmax.   Yes yes, another load of top
ten files, though this time from a new australian contributor. How to
piss off people listening in on your phone line, and how to cause
havoc at the shopping mall. Good stuff to have in mind when shit
happens to you, no? Yes.

156: "The Sad Part Of Raping" by Hedge.   A story that'll leave you
with more questions than answers. There are not much to say about
it, other than that it is a chilly story with blood stains on it.
Brrrrrrr.

157: "uXu Lyrics: Slowdive - Souvlaki" by The Chief.   At last, the
lyrics to the latest album from Slowdive. Trickier than ever, but
most of it is what it should be. Straight forward - Slowdive lyrics
are _tough_, but this'll help you on your way to enlightenment.

158: "Exciting Life" by The GNN.   What do you want from life? Do you
feel that urge to _do_ something? To become _someone_? To stand out
in a crowd. Be special. That would be great, wouldn't it? You'd be
doing what you wanted to do, all the time, right? Right...

159: "Advanced Phreaking Using Cordless Phones" by FreeStyle.   There
are ways you can use a cordless phone. There are ways you can use it
to your advantage. There are ways people can use Your cordless phone
to Your disadvantage. Now, do you want to miss this file?

160: "uXu Index #14" by The Chief.   Hmm, no comments on if the index
is needed or not since last time. Well, I guess it'll stay this way
then, 'til someone says something about it. <g>. This time the index
contains _New and improved_ information and general statistics.

161: "An Amazing Christmas Tale" by The GNN.   The way people make it
worth the hassle. For what? Why do you need the dough when you're
retired? Everyone saves enough money today, so they can spend it when
they're 70? What fun is that? It's not what this story is about, but
read it anyway.

162: "The Man Behind" by The GNN.   This one will be a classic! "A
genuine GNN!" they will say when you find it in the window of an
old crummy antique store. Never will you forget the words, the story.
And that is a promise. Highly recommended chilly reading.

163: "Bob - The Serial Killer" by The GNN.   The only place you'll
ever be able to read about Bob _is_ right here. Yes, that's right.
Oh, but you haven't been properly introduced, have you? Say hello
to Bob. You'll be surprised.

164: "How To Make a Bomb!" by The GNN.   One for the road, you say?
I don't think so. Seen this one before, you say? I do not think so.
Tired of those recipes that flood the e-zines and newsgroups throughout
the wrinkled computerized anarchy mecca? Then read this one.

165: "We Love You, Pigs!" by The Chief.   The thought behind this one
from the start was a joke, sort of. Writing about the way cops do their
thing - ought to be funny huh? Well maybe not.

166: "Interrogation" by The GNN.   Feeling low? Want to do something
fun? Are you stuck in your ways? Fuck, this sounds like a soda
commercial. I'm sick sick sick of it. This one's about an interrogation
if you didn't catch that. And it's dead serious.

167: "Red Team" by The GNN.   Now, here's a story about a killer. One
who used to work for _them_. What happened? Why does it say _used to_
work? Hmm, there must be a reason, and yes, you are right. Read on
and find out.

168: "10 Ways To Cause Havoc in Public Toilets" by BLaZe.   Yes! Ten
different tips that'll help your ass when you're close to the bowl
from our recent_and_very_new contributor BLaZe. Ain't that somethin'?

169: "The Stand" by The GNN.   A place where you're allowed to be.
Allowed? What keeps you from leaving that place? Is something, or
someone deciding for _you_ ? Ahem, well, this has something to do
with this story, sort of anyway. A GNN thang.

170: "A Theory of Justice - The Game Show" by The GNN.   At one stage
in the years of the human race, there will be someone who wants to
know what's going on behind the scenes. Politics, of course, but when
they don't work, (and quite frankly, have they ever?) what will happen?

171: "Five Stories From The Metaphysical Workshop" by The GNN.   I
think I'll let you describe this one by yourselves. It is not an
easy task, as it is five stories in one, but I think you will
be pleased and happy with all of them.

172: "uXu Index #15" by The Chief.   The filled-to-the-limit index
with the usual ingredients. What did you call it? Useless? Wonderful?
Nothing! Bah. So much for participating. The index (as you surely know
by now) contains information, general statistics and some other stuff
we make up ourselves. 

173: "The Eternal Machine" by The GNN.   There are minds behind your
every success. Behind all failures. And if you thought it was you,
you're wrong. Just think about it for a second and you have the answer,
or read this one if you want to cheat.

174: "We Are The Robots" by Hedge.   This marks the return of the
creative and enlighted Hedge, with a file on our society, what
controls the average mind, and what could happen (or is happening)
when the government starts to pick up on it.

175: "Clean Shaven Beauty III" by Ralph 124C41+.   The final and last
part of these creamy stories with yet another astounding end that you
won't expect (or what do I know.. maybe you've figured Ralph out?).

176: "Operation Moon Sucker" by The GNN.   One damn fine story I'd
like to say. Hey, wait a minute. Did I say story? Hmm, well, it's
not completely fiction anyway. Some of these things really happened.
Yeah, believe it. We're from Sweden, remember?

177: "Get Free Stuph and Kill People!!!!!" by Basehead.   The
Overlord Power-Destructo-Death-Head's finest tricks and tips that
will do you good, if you decide to read this one that is. You
_do_ believe me, don't you?

178: "How To Talk With ET's..." by Budha & Greg Iloyd.   Feeling
a bit out of touch, I'm not sure how to describe this one. The
best thing would be to just let you read it and decide for yourself.
To be honest though, yes, it does have something to do with aliens.

179: "The Unpaid Workers of Politics" by Hedge.   Now, this is really
a sequel to the 'We Are The Robots' file, and rightly so too. Another
look at our society, from another angle, and on another subject. Makes
you think, and that is good.

180: "Wild West" by The GNN.   Yes we all know it, but most people
try to hide behind the shiny, flashy front. America? Land of the
free? The one who told you that is your enemy. Or what was it Rage
Against The Machine said?

181: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter Three" by The Chief.   A
quick look at a dark page in Steve Castle's life. Yes, it is the third
part, and hopefully not the last (or I will be shot or sumpthin').
Continuing where part 2 left off.

182: "Who Knows?" by The GNN.   At this moment, this one isn't what
it originally was, and the reasons behind the change are not worth
to mention. Lets just say that it doesn't matter. Okay, it doesn't
matter.

183: "uXu Index #16" by The Chief.   No, it's hasn't changed. Why?
Well, probably because it's okay as it is, huh? :) Enough of that!
This is the index file, where you find news, updates on everything
worth updating, statistics (sort of), lists of places and people we
think you'd want to know about, a general hint to what them new files
are about (in case you're looking for something special, perhaps?),
and other assorted things. 

184: "The GNN's File #100" by The GNN.   There. This is something
we'd like to celebrate, but GNN himself took care of that by
writing another file. How ingenious, huh? Self-admiration? Self-
pity? Read on..

185: "How To Avoid Letter-Bombs" by Ralph 124C41+.   This file
could be a lot longer. In fact, it could be as long as you want
it. There are numerous ways to avoid letter-bombs. The first one?
Not to get one at all. But, here are a couple of good tips.

186: "Lock-Picking Using The 'Lock Clicker'" by The GNN.   We know
there are files on this subject, but they're outdated today. This
one is fresh, not frozen. This one is new, not old. This one is
for informational purposes only.

187: "Two-Two-Six-Eight" by Phearless.   One day, reality won't be
good enough for anyone living in it. One day, we'll all meet in
a different reality, or will we? What kind of reality would You
want instead of this one?

188: "The Fanatic Hunter" by The GNN.   The story isn't completely
made up. Some of it is true, but we'll let you decide what is and
what is not. This could happen though. Just continue to live your
guarded and well-arranged life, and you'll find out sooner or later.

189: "Methods For Creating A Paranoid Lifestyle" by Hedge & The GNN.
In case you aren't paranoid yet, there are a hundred reasons to make
even the most safe person in the world think, and here they are!
Neatly presented and packaged by our two realists.

190: "Gas Station" by The GNN.   Nowadays, you just don't want to
get involved when something happens, right? You're better off minding
you own business. Why bother with things that someone else just
as easily could do? Right. Why you?

191: "How To Get... Older Women Part III" by The Chief.   Yes, you
guessed it, and you know it. It's the third one in the series, with
updates, explanations and general thoughts behind this really really
interesting subject. Liked the first two? Then get this one as well.

192: "Final Discovery" by The GNN.   A discovery that would change
the world, wouldn't that be fun, huh? Something so mind-bending,
everyone, man, woman, child or animal, would change with it. Like
what everything in the world is made of, for example?

193: "Morality?" by Das Model.   The first file from our new
contributor deals with the morality of man. Howcome there is such
a thing as morality in the first place? What purpose does it serve?
Das Model explains the underlying facts.

194: "City Of Slaves" by The GNN.   A tale of a bum, a low-life,
scum. What happened you ask? No you don't. You don't care. He's
there because he did something. Something that made him sink down
the drain. You will never be like _that_ guy, will you?

195: "The City" by Hedge.   Not intentional, this one came after
The GNN's 'City Of Slaves' in this release. They are sort of similar,
but not quite. Well, in fact, they are different, but have some
joining parts that will please or un-ease you. The City.

196: "The Good Life" by The GNN.   In the future, is there such a
thing as death? Will we die, or what? Won't we just escape into
an alternate reality when the time comes? Or will there be something
else, that will enable us to live on forever? Or what? What?

197: "Ripmax Top Tenners #2" by Ripmax.   There really are too many
of these files floating around now, but we couldn't resist Ripmax
latest batch of tenners. They're good. They're funny. They're what
you'd expect. Not.

198: "Cybernetic Escape Route" by The GNN.   But didn't our latest
t-shirt contain the words "cyberdweebs"? Yes it did, though our
futuristic fiction master couldn't resist writing a file with a
title containing the word 'cyber'. Hehe, and you're going to read it.

199: "Learn To Love Big Brother" by The GNN.   One day, we have the
feeling there will be something, someone watching us. Following our
every move. Recording whatever we say. Judging us. Where did this
idea come from? What is done today to stop something like this from
happening? Is it what we want?

200: "uXu Does Town 1994" by All But Hedge.   You can believe it or
not, but here is another _first_ for the uXu series. All but one
of our regular writers contributed to this file, in various ways.
Pick a story and believe it.

201: "Reincarnation, Inc." by The GNN.   Wonders do happen. Sometimes.
Then again, sometimes they don't. In fact, most of the time, they
don't. So what if someone could assure that you would be reincarnated
as whatever you wanted? Wouldn't that be just fantastic?

202: "Time Traveller's Guide - An Introduction" by Phearless.   You
will be able to travel through time by follwing these easy steps.
It is true, though it may not be what you had expected. Follow the
advice, do not expand the limits, be careful and you will experience
something wonderful.

203: "Practical Redress" by The GNN.   Are you weak? Do you turn
away from the TV when something 'terrible' happens? Are you easily
disgusted? Then leave this file where it is. It'll make you puke.
It's the most violent one you'll ever read, if you do read it.

204: "uXu Index #17" by The Chief.   Another index for the indexed
mind. Well, I will spare you from nonsense comments this time, long
descriptions and useless information about the index because you all
know what the hell this is all about, right? Yeah, so don't come and
complain later on, y'hear! No more games. That's right, _no  games_.
And that's what I'm saying. Well, the index isn't a game, is it? No!

205: "Big Bang Phil" by The GNN. Chemistry class was always fun. The fear
in the teacher's eyes combined with the smell of something burning, how
we laughed. This Phil guy is one who prefer practical experiments to
theoretical.

206: "The Nightfly" by The GNN. Futuristic view on censorship in the
extreme. This little night talker has other things to worry about than
losing his air license. Feed your mind with these brand new bytes of art.

207: "Review: 'Bolero' by Jordan Lee" by Dee Philipp Binggeli. Our new
writer, the multimedia enthusiast Dee P Binggeli, manage to catch jazz
guitarist for a chat. This file contains a fresh interview with Jordan
Lee himself and a review of his latest album 'Bolero'. A must for fans
and music addicts.

208: "What To Say" by The GNN. Here it is. For people that never seem to
end a conversation the right way. Here's how to end one, quick and with
the usual smile guarantee. Prepare yourself for the next battle, as it
will come to you eventually.

209: "Speech For The Defence" by The GNN. Hell, one day you might be there
yourself. You never know, suddenly you _will_ realize that things are not
what they appear to be. Of course you only need to prove it. To yourself,
and to everyone else.

210: "How To Avoid Getting Hangover" by McCoy. Does the room spin when
you wake up and do you experience the sensation of being more thirsty
than the big bad wolf? Do you spend more than one hour trying to get out
of bed, just to step into your own vomit? Then do not worry! Crawl to
your computer, turn it on, and carefully read this file and you will
probably survive the day. Probably.

211: "Three Rendez-vous With The Men Of Power" by The GNN. Psychological
hardcore thriller by the most flexible writer we have in our staff. Easy
to read - hard to understand - very tough to believe. As always, it is
up to the reader what is to be taken seriously or not.

212: "Population X" by The GNN. Just because you can't see things doesn't
prove they are non-existant. Just because you can't believe in something
doesn't prove it isn't true. If something exists, does that prove that
it's real?

213: "Poetry Collection 1" by Bob Slack. Bob Slack returns after a while
of silence with this collection of poetry that mixes humble views at
the present situation with powerful explosions of anger.

214: "Poetry Collection 2" by Bob Slack. Some people say that poetry is
boring and a waste of time. Well, read this nine poems from our poetry-
meister and I can assure that you will change your mind.

215: "Poetry Collection 3" by Bob Slack. Love is always a good source
for inspiration. Luckily for us, Bob Slack recently stumbled over Karen,
who obviously is a real cutie pie, since he spoils us with yet another
bunch of poetry! Enjoy.

216: "Fuck You, Stefan Kronqvist" by The GNN. Personal opinions, or the
opinions of an entire generation? Do you know who Your "Stefan Kronqvist"
is? He will get to you, in one way or the other - and leave with or without
your mind, knowledge and perhaps even your life.

217: "Psycho(logical)scope" by Phearless. Who are you? What will you
become? From the basic facts you know about yourself, this file will
rape your mind and blow your top until it leaves you with the rational
understanding about yourself. Yes, the truth hurts.

218: "Everything You Need To Know About Techno" by Ralph 124C41+. The
fact remains: being a techno-fan is not easy at all. You must dedicate
yourself unless you want to make a fool of yourself in public. This file
will help you. Should be read while listening to anything that goes at
200 bpm or more.

219: "The Voter's Paradox" by Leon Felkins. How many of your decisions
in your life were made upon what You know and what You feel? Are you sure?
Think again. This is definitely recommended reading for the hungry.

220: "uXu Index #18" by Phearless & The GNN. The Chief: We didn't plan it
this way! Most people like organized and formatted collections. I know that,
because I'm a collector myself. Therefore, we made the index files as a part
of each release, with statistics, updates and descriptions. For those who
want this sort of stuff. For the collector, and for the reader. Nice to see
some of you actually reading this right now.

221: "Escape Macabre, The" by The GNN.   Chemistry in life. What we do
and what we don't do - it all makes a difference. If you're sure what
you want with your life, and that it is to just go with the flow, you
need to read this one, to get your mind started. To see the alternative
roads available to you.

222: "Five Poems" by Mr Dude.   Futuristic? No. Sarcastic? Maybe.
Real? Absolutely! Whatever feeling you have, here are five real-life
and in many ways true poems by one of our new contributors, Mr Dude.
A first not to be missed for sure.

223: "Final Mistake" by The GNN.   Our race have come a long way,
you might say. We're not the ones that makes mistakes like before.
Today, we have learned to plan, discuss and form our lives and what
we do, whatever it might be. Is that good? Maybe we should look
back, to the time we explored the world without hesitation?

224: "Contemplation In Rain" by Hedge.   Here we have a pleasant
poem from Hedge. It's so beautiful, you won't be able to hold your
tears. Green meadows, beds of flowers, a young girl in a white
dress with a picnic basket. Ha ha ha.

225: "Frozen Dreams" by The GNN.   Hell freezes over one day. We
don't know when, and we don't know why, but it does. This forms
an interesting question. Where _is_ hell? There is an expression:
hell on earth. Is that where hell is? Hell freezes over.. Earth
freezes over?

226: "A Cooperative Society" by Leon Felkins.   Does the behaviour
of people change when they are alone compared to when they are in
groups? And how does the individual behaviour affect the whole group?
Leon Felkins takes us through a deep, thourough and really
interesting discussion about this topic.

227: "The uXu Quiz" by The GNN.   Psychological chaos. Questions?
Yes! It _is_ a quiz for you, our readers.
Yes! There are prizes to be won.
Yes! You can send in your answers by e-mail or snail-mail.
Yes! It has to do with uXu.

228: "Histamin" by Pivic.   Just take a hollow mind. Fill it up
with experience and life, and you've got this fine collection of
short stories, weird stories, fun stories but true stories. Our
new contributor introduces you to what you can expect in the
future.

229: "Reel" by The GNN.   To watch a film. To edit it just the way
you want it to be. Wouldn't that pretty neat? That's what I thought
too. Maybe it's more to it, you know? When you edit out a piece of
that film.. Maybe it has an effect on everything else?

230: "Poetry Collections" by Bob Slack.   Some people just can't
stop. Heh heh. Here's another bunch of poems from Bob Slack. I'd
say - if you liked his past poems, you're going to love these.
Check them out, will ya!

231: "Terror Will Strike" by The GNN.   How do you change society?
Can you change it if you try? The general thought is that the state
is strong. It will not fall. It will punish you if you go against
it, and who'd want that? But maybe, maybe there is a way.

232: "Sweet Celebration" by Hedge.   Personal paranoia is a good thing
mostly. In small quantities anyway. But what do you do when there's
nothing left to do? You can only be as paranoid as the paranoia you
spread yourself. How paranoid are you now?

233: "Collage" by Ralph 124C41+ and Hedge.   Who would have guessed?
This is yet another 'first' for the uXu series, and you know what? It's
a JPG file. Yes, a picture. But not just any picture - it's a collage
of them crazy swedish uXu members and writers while on their 'uXu does
town 1994' tour in Stockholm. Ego? Of course.

234: "Future War" by The GNN.   There are people in the future, right?
And there were people in the past? There are people now, and they're
in the middle of past and future. Now, when you realize this, doesn't
that mean that whatever you do today, you have an effect on the people
of the future? Do you dare to walk out the door after reading this one?

235: "uXu Index #19" by The Chief.   A bit tired and frustrated, I admit,
but what can you do about it? I know. Nothing. Well, still hanging in
there, shaping the releases, organizing the facts and statistics, this
is the index file for this release. You ought to find some updates, stories,
new information, descriptions and statistics in here. If you don't, you're
reading the wrong file. Well, that takes care of it this time, or am I
wrong? I don't think so.

236: "Enforced" by The GNN.   Chemistry made it possible from the start.
Alcohol. What can we say about it? That it is nice to have a few beers
among friends a friday night? That it creates problems for others? That
it is classified as a drug. That it kills? In more ways that you'd
imagine.

237: "HoHoCon '94 Review" by Dr. No.   Futuristic fiction? Another
planet? Space aliens roaming about? No no. This is a report from
HoHoCon 1994. Read all about it! Who was there? Who wasn't there
What happened behind the scenes? Who got the Traci Lords video tapes?
Just read it and dream you were there.

238: "The Internet Hysteria" by The GNN.   Our society is changing. The
internet has been brought down to "ground-level" and with it, a vast
number of magazines, articles, TV shows and whatnot. New users on the
internet today have a massive guide in these, a guide that tells the
truth? A guide that they will follow? A guide that might destroy the
whole internet?

239: "Master Mind" by Classified Knowledge.   Here, for our mind
expanding series, we find yet another file. This time from an anonymous
contributor on the topic of controlling someone else's mind from a
distance. He, or she, describes the simple technique which you can
try out yourself after reading these instructions.

240: "Survive IRC" by The GNN.   Hell, a survive guide for IRC from uXu?
Well, why not? One of these days, even _you_ could end up on IRC, if
you haven't already (then you know of these things). For new users of
this chat-land, what could be better than a guide like this?

241: "Ellen Keys" by The Chief.   Does it take much to get arrested
these days? Who knows how it's like in _your_ country today, but we're
all heading for a society where information is the criminal, the author
the responsible, and the victim the reader, if we don't do something
about it pretty soon.

242: "No More Secrets" by The GNN.   A file that could be linked to the
others in our view of the government versus hackers. We have several
files on this topic, but the more the better we feel, so here's another
one that takes another step to try to get the true information out in
the open.

243: "Meaning of?" by Polish Polish.   Just imagine yourself at the
very very top of the cream. You could do whatever you wanted, (and still
be arrested somehow of course, but that's not the point!) What would you
do? What would you say?

244: "The New World Order" by The GNN.   To create a new world order
would take a whole lot of work and money, don't you think? To have
the masses behind you, with the same judgement and values as you,
with guns or not. A pretty hard task for most of us. Or is it?

245: "Party Time" by Pivic.   Some unfinished business can be your
worst nightmare when you least expect it. What happens during an
evening can change your whole life. Be aware of it before it happens.

246: "A Slight Miscalculation" by The GNN.   How would time traveling
look like, do you think? Would it be an easy task creating time machines
that would work? Work like they were made to work? How about testing?
Who would do the testing and what would that create? Now, that's
humour for you.

247: "The 'Land" by Hollywood.   Personal view from a new contributor
on things that might well be a future problem. Who knows what new
technology and little used brains might create? Read this and get
hooked into a line of thought.

248: "What Is This Thing Called Progress?" by The GNN.   Who wants
to know? You? Me? All of us? Well then. The GNN presents some thoughts
on the subject. Maybe it will create a thought in your head?

249: "uXu Index #20" by The Chief.   Thank you! Yes, it's here. After
Christmas. But what did you expect? I know. Nothing. But, here it comes.
The index file for this release. What you don't know about it already,
I don't know, but for old time's sake, here are some of the contents:
Updates, a small introduction, new information, long and short descriptions
plus statistics. Okay then. That should be enough for you to grab this
unmissable file.

250: "Swift Justice" by The GNN.   Chemistry has nothing to
do with it I'm afraid. What does have to do with this story
then?, you ask. Power. Work. Guilt. Execution. Intelligence.
That should be enough to make you interested.

251: "Your Own Life" by Phearless.   Futuristic? No. A true
story? Well, not really a story. It could have been though,
but unfortunately it isn't. Best described, thoughts about
the truths of the system.

252: "Letter To a Prisoner" by The GNN.   Our own power-
penetrating philosopher looks through the blinds of society
and questions the authorities' way of handling the criminal
system of today.

253: "Guide To a College-Year Abroad" by McCoy.   Here are
some answers to questions foreigners might have about
going to college in the U.S. Just take it seriously if
you want. Or just don't.

254: "Is This Art?" by The GNN.   Hell does exist on earth!
What? It does? Where is it? Where can I find it? Here's
one who found it, or should I say, thought she found it.
And she's not alone.

255: "More Time!" by Phearless.   A futuristic story with a
twist to it, that'll hopefully make you think a bit about
what the future might look like. Read it and act before it
is too late!

256: "Angel" by The GNN.   Are there angels, one might ask?
I can't answer that questions, as I am not sure myself, but
I think you might find somewhat of an answer in this, nice
yet intriguing story.

257: "Suicidal" by The Chief.   Just imagine everyone telling
you to do it. To go through with it, or you're a damn coward.
Laughing in your face. Pushing you in the corridors. Until
you can't take it anymore. Would you do it?

258: "uXu And S.H.A., Facts And Fiction" by The GNN.   We
were forced to write this one. To make certain that no-one
had any doubts about what uXu really is all about, and that
we're _not_, I repeat, _not_, a hacker group.

259: "Love, Sex And Marriage" by Leon Felkins.   As the title
suggests, this file is about love, sex and marriage. More
accurately, it is about why we react the way we do with regard
to love, sex and marriage. This one will create discussions.

260: "On 'Love, Sex And Marriage'" by The GNN.   A direct
and genuine discussion about the previous file (259) from the
GNN, able to penetrate the subject, from a philosopher's
point of view.

261: "A Guide To Paranoia" by Phearless.   Personally, I feel
that this is the third part of Phearless series about chaos,
panic and paranoia, and who's going to tell me it is not?
If you're not paranoid yet, you better check this one out.

262: "To Kill a Bouncer" by The GNN.   Who hasn't met these
at the doors to a club, at a bar or at the front of a concert?
And who can say that most of them are nice and friendly? Even
without these questions, I know you will like this one.

263: "The Evil Demon" by The Chief.   And god created man?
Well, who can be sure of that these days when science is our
newly born 'god' that we can depend upon. But can we be sure
of _that_ 'god' then? Are you sure?

264: "David Letterman" by Phearless.   Yes, the story has got the
same name as the late show host, but does that mean that it
contains guests, music and a top ten list? Read it and find
out for yourself.

265: "DMV & 2D Bar Codes" by Mario.   What could be more
suitable than a technical file in this release? Without one
we wouldn't be complete. Here it is. About (what we sort of
already have in Sweden) the future U.S. ID cards.

266: "Year of Fun" by Phearless.   Look at this story, covering a
whole year. Doesn't it seem familiar? Perhaps too familiar?
Isn't this a description of what _your_ life looked like last
year? I bet it is!

267: "Respublica" by The GNN.   Now this one is really up-to-date
these days with all the elections going on, at least here in
Europe. Makes you think about why _your_ vote should be _your_
vote, and nothing else.

268: "uXu Index #21" by The Chief.   That's it! Writing about these
indexes are becoming pretty tiresome, because I know as well as you
know you're (to a 99% accurate assumption) reading the index when you
read this! Yes, well, what are you waiting for? Info about the index
when you just (almost) read it? Yes? Okay, here it is: The index
includes not just updates, an introduction, new (and old) information,
long and short descriptions + statistics.

269: "Never Work With Amateurs" by The GNN.   Before you do what you
have been planning for a while now, please take your time and really
think through a thing or two about the amateur-syndrome. Scary reading
for the optimists.

270: "Pray For Me" by Phearless.   Pray for who? For Phearless himself?
Or for Phearless and someone else? Well, you better find that out
yourself, by reading this poem. Many of you have probably experienced
the same thing: It is called love.

271: "American Nightmares" by The Chief.   Probably the most boring
file in this release will take you through the eyes of a narrow-minded
swede, and watch the way he looks at the politics currently sweeping
floors in the United States of America.

272: "Drama" by The GNN.   Once again we are taught that nothing
is what it seems to be. Perhaps this story will help you keep calm
in all kinds of desperate situations, no matter what. To quote a
famous writer and at the same time putting it simple, Don't Panic.

273: "Only The Lonely" by Hedge.   Loneliness can be a nice thing. At
least sometimes, when you feel the need to be by yourself. But when
it's not out of your own free will, when nothing grabs you out of
it, it just might be really, really harmful.

274: "The Driving Test" by The GNN.   There are always more than one
way to reach your goals, as well as skinning a cat. When you've gone
through all the nice and friendly ways, you are bound to end up with
what is explained in this humorous piece.

275: "The Wind" by Knyttet.   It has been called objective realism. The
idea that something might exist independent of our own beliefs. Here
is a file that examines that, but in a slightly different sense. Worth
reading.

276: "The Second Excuse" by The GNN.   Our fanatic writer tells you
how things really are in the textfile business. If you are easily
upset by a somewhat negative response to your work, take a valium or
two before reading this otherwise entertaining text.

277: "Boy Racer" by Pivic.   Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Isn't
that nice? The things couples say to each other, the things they do
for each other. Yeah, right. Sometimes, meeting the Right person is
not that right after all. Will you recognize yourself in this essay?

278: "Guardians of The Masses" by The GNN.   This document will not
teach you anything. The ones this file is about - all of us - can
react in three different ways; _What kind of crap is this?_, _It's
actually true!_ or for the fortunate of you; _So, what's new?_

279: "Eric's Trip" by The Chief.   Want to know something? Something
you probably did not know before? If you answer yes to both the above
questions, you're probably the only one not knowing. And then you're
probably the person handling this subject in the swedish government.
And then you're the one this file is written for.

280: "Hacker's Paradise" by The GNN.   Let's talk about the power of
a weapon. A weapon that might become more powerful than any sword, gun
or bomb ever made in the history of man. If this sounds interesting
and perhaps frightening, it is nothing compared to what you will be.

281: "Ripped Off - Big Time" by Phearless.   Money rules and bullshit
runs, they say. Unfortunately, both bullshit and money seem to be on
their way to rule the net soon. But things could be done to stop that.
This file will tell you why and how.

282: "Pray For Us" by The GNN.   Just when you thought our general
quality was on a constant rise and being versatile was something
positive, the GNN - merciless as always - throws this at his own
comrade/s.

283: "I Just Fell" by Pivic.   Benevolent people are rare nowadays.
It's not strange, helping people without second thoughts might just
turn out for the worse, as Pivic has noticed.

284: "The Sentence" by The GNN.   Imagine a world full of misery,
full of restrictions but yet full of people. Not as hard as one might
think at first is it? In fact, we're probably all living there right
now. The only question is, is it possible to escape it all?

285: "Running" by Phearless.   Have you done things that you didn't
want to do? Or perhaps wondered if the things you do are really what
you want to do? Hey, I'm not asking you to examine your whole view of
the world! But this short text might make you.

286: "Stigma" by The GNN.   Some people betray themselves and others
for a living. Seen from the eyes of a writer, this is how his life
became and what he learned from it. It might not be such a bad idea
to compare his story with your own.

287: "What Is?" by Phearless.   We have nourished a philosopher among
us without even knowing it. Here, he presents you with a load of
thoughts that ought to be read by every human being, now and every time
life gets tricky, rough or even too good. Think about it.

288: "Orwell-Was-Ten-Years-Late" by Pivic.   Big Brother still haunts
us, even though we haven't really seen him in person. Some people
believe that he won't show up at all. But when you least expect it -
he's here! And what will that look like?

289: "uXu Index #22" by The Chief.   Changes changes changes. We
all felt that it was time for a change. The copyright notice at the
beginning, and the 'how to find what's new' sections are gone. The
'be a part of the uXu team' has been changed. The list of people who
have written something for us in the past is gone. The Dist Site
list at the beginning is gone and the Dist Site list at the end
has changed because of it. The DSR index is gone. What's left of
it? Well, read it and see.

290: "How To Hack And Get Caught" by Phearless.   There are billions
of files around that will tell you how to hack and _not_ get caught.
But why settle with those? This file will take you to the point that
you sooner or later will come to if you are a hacker.

291: "Kraykkono Inn" by The GNN.   You thought you liked foreign food,
right? But how different do you want it? Even if you want to make an
impression on someone, how far are you willing to go? Is it not so,
dear people, that food tastes better just because it is foreign and
_exotic_?

292: "Help For The Average" by Knyttet.   'Most people are average,'
claims the author of this file. But she does not stop there. Instead,
she continues and offers some help for those people. It is not that
hard to stop being average.

293: "Freedom In A Cage" by The GNN.   Freedom, oh freedom. Is there
anything sweeter than that? Can you tell freedom from a bag of mashed
potatoes? Read this enlightening, and perhaps even disturbing text on
this topic.

294: "Comments To The Unabomber Manifesto" by Phearless and The GNN.
Hey man, put on the latest sunglasses from Prestige INC, mail a bomb
to someone and try to look like Wierd Al. Who are you then? Yep, the
Unabomber. Write a manifesto and we will comment on it. As Phearless
and GNN has done here.

295: "Less Known Dilemmas" by The GNN.   Here our excentric writer
describes a few and sometimes easy-to-recognize dilemmas that occur in
our everyday life. Some things that happens to us we just ignore, but
there are problems that just will not be solved and forgotten.

296: "A Woman's Conscience" by Knyttet.   Conscience is the inner voice
that warns us that someone may be looking, it is said. It is also said
that men and women have different inner voices. This story is considering
that subject, in a sense.

297: "The Last Cocktail Party" by The GNN/Hedge.   It comes times when you
really would like to know it all. Questions pops up in your head and
wherever you look, there is no answer to be found. But perhaps, knowing
it all is not the best way after all? Read and find out for yourself.

298: "An Introduction To Beer" by Ralph 124C41+.   So you believe that
you know everything about beer, right? Sure you do - when you are drunk.
Come on, if you want to make your friends adore you for knowing so many
facts about beer, you need to read this text.

299: "To Get To The Real Problems" by The GNN.   It is not easy to solve
a problem, if you do not know where to begin. You know that every solution
creates more problems, so you want to cut the problem by it's roots. This
is not as easy as it might seem for a start. The closer you look, the more
frightened you are likely to get.

300: "Paradox Crew" by The GNN.   Hmm. File number three hundred? Time
for celebration, a serious quality overhaul or just keep that smirk on
our faces? uXu says; we celebrate anything at any point of time. We do
not need a number to help us out.

301: "To Lose Your Religion" by Knyttet.   Contrary to popular belief,
religion is not always a good thing. Invented for the sake of saving
people, religion may sometimes even do the opposite thing. This file
is true - told by someone who has seen much of it, and lost it.

302: "ABB Part I" by The GNN.   This is an intriguing trilogy that will
fascinate most of you, hopefully. In this first part, we follow what
the main character experiences during one special day, at work. It is not
going to be just another day of helping people.

303: "ABB Part II" by The GNN.   In this part of the trilogy we look in
to what the people around the main character are doing during the same
period of time as in part I. Perhaps you recognize some of the characters,
are they not very similar to your friends at work?

304: "ABB Part III" by The GNN.   The last and maybe the most confusing
part of this trilogy. Try to keep up with what is explained in this
revealing episode of this part, so you do not miss out on something
important of what the author and observer is trying to tell you.

305: "Loved Anyhow" by Knyttet.   There is always someone who loves
you, no matter who you are or what you do. This idea is sometimes
hard to accept. But we need to accept it, for the sake of humanity.
If you have some trouble, turn to this essay.

306: "Kicks" by The GNN.   What makes people, men in particular, do all
the crazy, and perhaps stupid things they do? Why do they do the same
dangerous thing over and over again? Do you have the answer to that, does
the author of this file have it? Find out!

307: "Losers' Guide To Becoming A Successful Intellectual" by Joseph.
You are nothing. You will never become someone. You are a man. True? If
the  answer is 'yes,' we say 'oh dear,' and recommend you to follow the
instructions presented in this file.

308: "Five Boxes In The Desert" by The GNN.   People need something to
do, that is a well known fact. People are never satisfied with just
surviving one day to the next, because that is not fun enough. How busy
must a human be to become really happy. Will this man ever find out?

309: "A Letter To The Editor" by Leon Felkins.   In our previous release
(#22), The Chief wrote a file on contemporary american politics. Now
it is time for a _real_ american citizen to comment on that. Deeply,
and to-the-point, Leon offers you his views on the subject.

310: "The Voice" by Knyttet.   Once upon a time, a confused individual
who thought that she was not confused at all, heard a voice. This
voice revealed some facts about her own life that she had never
considered. Maybe this voice will reveal some facts about your spatio-
temporal situation too?

311: "Cognitive Neural Hardware And The Nerd" by The GNN.   One day, not
far from today, all this will become true. You know it and we know it.
It is just a matter of time before we are all literally addicted. You will
laugh and giggle at it now, but tomorrow you will wish for it to be all
made up and nothing else.

312: "The Invasion" by Phearless.   A long time ago, something happened.
A place was invaded, and... and... Do you want to know more what I am
talking about? Then read this excellent piece of short-story science
fiction. Guaranteed to twist your mind.

313: "Middle Cuts" by The Chief.   It is much easier to cope with big
problems than small ones, mutatis mutandis; it is more comfortable to
sit on a mountain than on a nail. All these damn little irritating
phenomenas that surrounds us makes life miserable! Chief knows some of
them, and will share them with you from a personal point of view.

314: "uXu Index #23" by The GNN & Phearless.   Bom Bom Bom pa ditt arsle!
Well, not much to say about this file. It is the index, as usual. The
only difference is that is has not been written by The Chief. Okay, that
is not the only difference: We have now got two kinds of subscriber lists,
one 'usual' ("SUBSCRIBE") and one for those who merely wants to know when
a release has been put out ("uXu Info"). Scan the top of this file for
detailed information.

315: "The Terrorists of Dissatisfaction" by The GNN.   There are those
who consider life to be boring and frustrating. Then there are those
who are happy, who enjoy life to the limit. On what side are you? In
any case, as you are on one, or even both sides sometimes, this file
concerns you.

316: "Alien Invasion" by Joseph.   You might think that we are not alone
in this universe. You might have heard people talk, watched programs on
the TV, read books, reports and newspapers, about meeting aliens. In their
backyards, on a field, in their bed. Can this really be true?

317: "Daddy's Girl" by Knyttet.   Most accidents happen in your own home.
Most people's problems are domestic ones. Things that happen in your house
can really change your life, contrary to general belief. Here, Knyttet
tells you a bit about such problems.

318: "Bitte Denken!" by Joseph.   Are you one of those who think that
the government is experimenting with your brain when you watch the TV
or read the papers? Do you question everything that is said to you?
Then you do not need to read this short, but informational text.

319: "What Is This Thing Called The System?" by The GNN.   What do
you think The System is? Is it really Them working in the government,
the agencies, those who have the power? Well, then you just might
want to read this one, and think again.

320: "Time" by Knyttet.   You have probably thought of time several
times in your life, but have you really considered what time really
is? And why does it exist? For what purpose? If you threw away your
watch, would you be timeless? Here are some thoughts on the subject.

321: "Critics" by Joseph.   Critics can be found everywhere in our
society today. They review books, paintings, movies, music, plays,
magazines, festivals.. well, you name it, and there they are. And
they are getting more and more attention. They are on their way to
stardom! But why? Why do we listen to them even? And who decided that
their taste is the collective good one?

322: "Staying Sane" by Ralph 124C41+.   You hear a lot during a day,
don't you? People tell you things, you listen to the radio and you
watch the TV. But sometimes, they say things that you just can't
grasp - things that you know to be the truth, but they tell you
different. Things they say are true, but you can never check them
for yourself.

323: "Don't Date Me" by Joseph.   So you have been dumped by your
girlfriend. Again. What can you do about it? Just go with the flow
as usual. Cry a bit, then start over again with the next girl you
meet? How long will you cope with this? For this guy, it was enough.

324: "Games People Play" by The GNN.   There are important games and
then there are _important_ games. Do you consider any World Cup,
the Olymic Games or Stanley Cup to be _important_, you will probably
reconsider after reading this one.

325: "Three Ways Total Losers Get Even" by The Chief.   When total losers
are out to get even, you know what will happen. That's right, they will
just get themselves into more trouble. In this file, The Chief brings up
three of the most useless "get even" advice ever or never published.

326: "Doing Dunblane" by Joseph.   For those of you with your nose in
the newspaper, here is somewhat of a story taken from the news. Well,
almost anyway. If you have heard the name Dunblane, you know what it
is all about, though not quite. Oh well.. read it and weep.

327: "Struggle" by Knyttet.   How about a drug related short story?
Well, think about it at least. If you have been there, you might
recognize yourself. If not, it might make you think twice before
you say yes.

328: "A Man In Need" by Joseph.   If you want to read a strange story,
about some strange people, with a strange beginning and an even more
strange end, containing some strange arguments that you might understand,
though probably not, then this is a story made just for you.

329: "Under The Surface" by The GNN.   Like if you knew what freedom
means, imagine that someone, some day, comes up to you and completely
alters your view. Changes it to something so extreme, that you are
bound to agree, because it was really something you had never thought
of before!

330: "The Second uXu Quiz" by uXu.   Above all, what does really count?
Of course - yet another uXu Quiz with, frankly, too easy questions and
useful, carefully selected and expensive prizes to be won! You are right
Sir! So, read the file, send your answers to The GNN within fifteen days,
and you might just be one of our lucky winners!

331: "A Prayer For War" by Hedge.   Open up your eyes and take a look at
the wars going on right now, or the wars that have been. In general, we
detest war and love peace, right? So are those who start and fight these
wars completely crazy, or can a war actually be a good thing sometimes?

332: "Implants" by The Chief.   Think about the future. Think about the
fiction genre, books and movies. What is it that stands out from it all?
Implants. If it isn't perfect bodies, perfect appearences, it is computer
chip implants. Here is a view that might make you say "Plug in, drop out."

333: "One Step Forward, Two Back" by Joseph.   Questions questions
questions.. If you are interested in political questions, revolutions
or the ways the government controls everyone of us, this is probably
one text you do not want to miss.

334: "Bleed III" by The GNN.   Will the story never end!?, you might
ask yourself after learning that yet another part of the critically
acclaimed, often debated... computer game?! is out. But this is a
t-file group isn't it? Hmm, you better check this one out for
yourselves to make sure we're not doing something terrible!!

335: "Valentine's Day" by Knyttet.   Do you go around telling people
you care about, that you care about them? Do you tell the ones you love,
that you love them? Whenever you feel like it? Probably not. And that
is why you need to read this one.

336: "uXu Index #24" by The Chief.   Joda, here is the index again.
Still filled with information about the new release and still with
nifty information about the uXu sect and it's followers. What to do
to join, what to do to get out. Where you can find us, and where you
can not. What government agencies to contact in order to get rid of
us, and ... uh.. well. You know what to do!

337: "6 Four A - Six Short Poems" by The GNN.   These poems were
written under extreme pressure and with a lot of sensitivity. Dark
and frightening but still true in a sense. Try them. Maybe you will
like them?

338: "Taking a Bus Ride" by Knyttet.   You know how it is like when
you are going by bus. You usually have enough time to think about
this and that, what to eat tonight and the world crisis at hand, at
the same time. Here are some thoughts from a bus ride.

339: "Screenplay: The Last Bullet" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay
adapted from the short story "Angel" (uXu file #256). If you want to
take a look at the screen shots to it as well, please check any of our
homepages listed at the end of this file. You can also see a quick
collection of some screen shots in uXu file #360.

340: "Swedish Moose Surprise" by Knyttet.   Are we really alone in
this country thinking that it is pretty worthwhile to know as much
as possible about another country when you go to that country? No,
probably not. But here is a couple who never thought about it.

341: "The Infinite Wisdom Chip" by The GNN.   What would happen if
we did have access to all the information, every piece of the big
information cake? Isn't that exactly what we are all looking for,
and heading towards these days?

342: "Mind Expectations" by Knyttet.   You go around mumbling to
yourself all day? You yell at your next-door neighbor? You hate
that guy or girl (you know who I'm talking about)? Well, why not?
But what's the point? Why not try to make an effort, to be nice
for a change?

343: "Medieval Dreams" by Mercuri.   Critics reading this series
will love this one, because they will have a field day with it.
The discussion about what's good and what's not, when it comes to
war and peace continues. Here with thoughts from Mercuri.

344: "Screenplay: In The Colosseum" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay
adapted from the short story "Interrogation" (uXu file #166). If you want
to take a look at the screen shots to it as well, please check any of
our homepages listed at the end of this file. You can also see a
quick collection of some screen shots in uXu file #360.

345: "Magic" by Knyttet.   So, you say that we are all gloomy, dark
and depressing, huh? Well, then you should take a closer look at this
piece, and see if you're not smiling after you have read it. We all
need a little cheering up now and then. This is now.

346: "Mailing Lists - Part 1" by The Chief.   There are several thousand
mailing lists on the Internet. Each day, a new one is born. Each day
a mailing list dies. If you're seriously planning on starting your own
mailing list, you need to take a look at this basic introduction, which
will give you an idea to what you're getting yourself involved with.

347: "Head Full of Chewing Gum" by Knyttet.   When you want to say that
really really important thing to that extremely good looking girl/guy,
and all that comes out of your mouth is "duh..", then you know what
we're talking about.

348: "Poesis/The Slab1.0" by aleph-6.   For those of you with a more
advanced bizarre taste in poetry and stories, this is a two-part
extravaganza thingy. Pretty generous don't you think? Nothing for
those of you with a fragile mind.

349: "More Than One Truth" by Knyttet.   How many truths do you think
are out there? Do you believe there's only one single and simple truth?
Do you believe everything they say on the news? Yes? No? In any case,
you should read this file. It might give you some ideas.

350: "The Decline of The Swedish Underground" by Dare Devil Show.   If
you did understand Swedish, and read a couple of issues of the electronic
publication mentioned in this file, you'll understand what Dare Devil
Show is talking about. But, if you're interested in learning more about
the Swedish underground anyway, this file is for you.

351: "To Make Choices In Life" by Knyttet.   Like everyone else in this
world, you have to make choices. Now, tomorrow, yesterday. You make
choices at all times. Some more important, some not that important, but
still choices. Here are some thoughts about this.

352: "Screenplay: Burn Time" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay adapted

353: "Why I Prefer To Be a Woman" by Knyttet.   Open your eyes and
read through this one guys. Here are the facts. Why it is better
to be a woman than a man. You can clearly see that everything written
in this file must be true, right?

354: "The Internet Word Reference Book - Chapter I" by The Chief.
Think about it! Do you know where the words and terms used on the
Internet today comes from? From the very beginning? Some people have
tried to explain this, but failed. Finally, there is a correct
reference! And here is the first chapter.

355: "The Creator" by Knyttet.   Questions about why we are here,
who put us here, and what we are supposed to do with all our spare
time, are pretty common. Knyttet does not try to give you answers
to these questions, but does have a pretty nifty theory.

356: "Bukowski's Birthday" by Joseph.   Will Bukowski get another
tie on his birthday? No, probably not. Something one might wonder
about, if one were interested in such things. Well, if you are
wondering if Bukowski gets another tie, go ahead and read this one.

357: "Move" by Knyttet.   Do you know a love story when you see one?
Well, you're going to see this one miles away. Even though the title
doesn't really reveal that much, you ought to know that this is one,
with roses and every emotion involved. When you're moving.

358: "The Point" by The GNN.   One thing that has been clear to us
over the years, is that people want to know the point. The point
of this and the point of that. Whatever we have done, there has
always been someone asking what the point was. So, here you go,
here is the answer.

359: "A Teacher's View" by Knyttet.   When you teach children, you
definitely know that you can make a change in their lives. The things
you teach them today, may eventually decide what they will become
in the future.

360: "Screenplay Screen Shots" by uXu.   In this file you'll find an
uuencoded JPG picture with selected screen shots for the three screenplays
included in this release. All complete screen shots can be found on
any of our homepages (see below for addresses).

361: "Her Volvo" by Knyttet.   Ahh.. to love a car. Isn't that one
of the most beautiful things one can do these days? No? Oh well,
you're probably right. Anyway, here's a short story about a girl
and her car. A Volvo.

362: "Three Poems" by Scott Poole.   About three.., actually exactly
three beautiful poems by Scott. You will laugh, you will cry. Just
read them, okay?

363: "uXu Index #25" by The Chief.   The last and 23rd Index from
me, and the start of a new era of Indexes from the new Ed Bravemoore.
Well, you know what to expect from the Indexes by now, complete info
about where, who, why, what and when. Sort of like a FAQ. That's it,
the uXu FAQ. Go get it if you're not reading it now!

364: "Seven Steps In The Computer Evolution" by The GNN.   Everything
evolve, as we all know. Even small pieces of rock actually evolves, but
perhaps not in the common use of the word. Here's a new view of an old
prophecy, just to remind you.

365: "The Big C" by Knyttet.   Now what could this be? No, it's not Caesar.
Just when your surroundings were looking more soft and pink than ever before,
something like this hits you. Perhaps an uncomfortable piece for some of you.

366: "The Can And The Future" by The GNN.   Through history man has tried
to get a glance of his or her future. Some looking in coffee-grounds, some
use a sphere of glass. There are some other ways too, however. Don't try this
at home folks, we are professionals... (FLW #71)

367: "The Computer Enthusiast" by Phearless.   There's more than one way to
skin a cat, they say (who? I don't know, it's just a stupid saying. Ask
someone else, willya?). You can read this in more than one way, but no matter
how you end up reading it, you'll find yourself with the same conclusion.
Boy^H^H^HPerson, was that a hint or what?

368: "The Girl And The Robot" by The GNN.   Irresponsible young people have
been blamed for a lot of things over the years. This file doesn't really say
anything that differs from this, but please check it out to make sure you've
found your place in life already.

369: "My Best Friend" by The Chief.   Wow, and I thought I had a tough time
at work... Now I realize that _some_ people have the same problem all of
their living hours. But in a (not so) strange way, I'm sure you'll recognize
yourself.

370: "The Secret Actors" by The GNN.   Now, we had some very heavy and
intensive discussions with the people described in this file, before we
agreed to release it. Hope this experience doesn't totally flip your
universe.

371: "Clipped Short And Back" by Holly Day.   Holly Day gives you three of
her poems, including "Clipped Short And Back", "1830 To The End Of The World"
and "My Mother". Each one stands for itself.

372: "The Anatomy Of Pseudo-Science" by The GNN.   We all know about it, some
of us have seen it and some of us have actually experienced the concept of
pseudo-science. Some take it lightly, some dead serious. Another text to take
sides in.

373: "A Letter Never Sent" by Knyttet.   Carpe Diem - seize the day. Things
you did can't be undone. Things you didn't do - can be done... Simple rules
for some, but even if you do know about this, you always seem to end up
regretting some of your choices in life.

374: "The Crowd And The Stigma" by The GNN.   Metaphors are great when
describing things that are hard to explain, or perhaps easily misunderstood.
Metaphors are also great for confusing people who once used to have a
somewhat clear mind...

375: "Sucks" by DK.   This one might not be for the faint of heart, nor for
the ones who think some things should not be described in detail. The rest of
you, share the thoughts of the characters of this text for a moment.

376: "Power Check" by The GNN.   Our jury who beta-read all files before
including them in a relase got very upset when reading this one. They were
actually so upset that we had to sack the whole lot of them, steal their
salary for this month and spend it all down at the local pub.

377: "Marauder" by The GNN.   Authors can be lazy, active or addicts.
Typically, but not as a rule, the addicts are the ones showing the best
productions. I wouldn't say it's because of some special writing skill, nah.
Let me put it like this: if you fired one shot with a revolver at a target a
hundred feet away, or fired five hundred rounds with a machine gun at the
same target... Would the number of bullets hitting the target reflect
the skill of the person's precision shooting skills? In one way, yes. In
another, no... aww, forget it.

378: "Sleepy?" by Phearless.   A journey into dream land, or an experiment
for and of the mentally challenged? What some of us know, others have to find
out for themselves. Poor sob, I hope he surfaces before the next release.
Meanwhile, his computer makes a good addition to my network for playing
popular gory games.

379: "Alienated Relationships" by The GNN.   Take a look around, do the
couples you see (or know) look happy? Look sad? Angry? Crazy? Well, to make
things easier for you to recognize the different kinds of relationships,
The GNN wrote down the characteristics of a few of them.

380: "uXu Index #26" by Bravemoore.   It has all you are looking for.
Listings: all released files so far, detailed one for release #26,
the distribution sites (FTP/BBS/Gopher) and information how to contact
the uXu. You can even find out the pluralis form of "index," which is
"indice."
