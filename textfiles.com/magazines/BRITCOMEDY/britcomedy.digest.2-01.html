Spotted this in the latest Britcomedy Digest: "It's hard to name a British
comedian who *hasn't* appeared in commercials or at least done
voice-overs..." ("Newsquirks," vol. 1 no. 13). One British comedian who
doesn't do commercials is Ben Elton.

Just finished reading the latest edition of the Digest. I enjoyed it very
much. Well done!

That said, I did notice one omission in the digest. When you were listing
Rik Mayall's appearances, you only listed his first appearance on
"Blackadder." He also was in the fourth series, "Private Plane," again as
Lord Flashheart.

The series of films about the constitution ("Cleese Ad Deemed Unsuitable
for Children," News, v. 1 no. 13) had nothing whatsoever to do with
Cleese's non-smoking ad's which, at a guess, where being paid for by the
Department of Health -- who are hardly likely to want to be responsible
for a series critising the government.

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Thank you for the correction. Several readers wrote in 
about this error; it was due to an editorial mistake, not the news staff's 
doing.

In Kingsley Amis's _Memoirs_ (Summit Books, 1991, p. 180), the author
writes:
 
	"[Peter Sellers] told me that the whole resurgence or whatever it was of
	British humour had been started or invented by the Goons in their radio
	show of 1951-1960... It occurred to me too late that _essentially_ the
	Goons (with Major Bloodnok) had derived from ITMA (with Colonel
	Chinstrap), and so had much else besides."
 
Do any Britcomedy Digest readers know what "ITMA" was?

                               Roosevelt Dimes, Fort Worth, TX
 
EDITOR's RESPONSE: "ITMA" stands for "It's That Man Again," a popular radio
series in the UK during the 1950's. Any readers who know more about this
show are encouraged to write to BD.

With regard to the remaining lost episodes of "Q5" (see "Letters," v. 1
no. 13), it now seems unlikely that the collector has the rest after
all... However, Spike Milligan fans will be pleased to know that the BBC
are producing a 90-minute documentary about his life and work, which will
feature many obscure clips. Spike was also able to view one of the
returned "Q5's" at a recent screening at the National Film Theatre.

As far as BBC Web pages go, I think you will begin to see more. Although
slow to get off the ground, the BBC is now taking the 'net very seriously,
so I think it will flourish. As with all these things, positive feedback
to their efforts so far is the best way to encourage them.

Very nice job on the Digest. Regarding Spike Milligan's laudatory comments
about the Pythons, he should remember there are SIX geniuses in the
troupe, not FIVE.

My faves are Python and "Are You Being Served?". Just now getting into
"Keeping Up Appearances" ([I] never see ANYTHING written on that show
anywhere on the 'net). Question: How come no one ever writes anything
about "Dave Allen at Large"? (And NO wisecracks for answers to that
question!)

Keep up the great work.

EDITOR'S RESONSE: I'll restrain myself from making wisecracks... There
haven't been any articles about Dave Allen for the simple reason that
you're the first to ask. With so many Britcoms out there, I tend to cover
whatever the readers request. Thank you for writing -- I hope to cover
this wonderful comedian in the future.

I surfed all your pages and links... where is the important message that
the opening night will be December 8 at the Hammersmith Apollo Theatre for
a new "Bottom" show... This could really be (for me and my 5 devoted fans)
a great oppertunity to meet other "Bottom" fans from the 'net in real
life. How about some sort of happening?

                               Well Byeeeeee

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: The "Big Number Two Tour" dates are included in this
issue, along with Alexei Sayle's tour dates. And I've extended an open
invitation for a get-together to those who'd like to meet fellow Internet
Bottom fans (see "etc.").

Saw Britcomedy Digest on alt.tv.red-dwarf. Brilliant, the URL is now in my
bookmark.

I do have a question re: "In 1965 he made a much-publicized conversion to
Christianity." ("Cliff Richard Gets Knighted," News, v. 1 no.13) I thought
his conversion came much later -- as in circa 1980. Am I confused?

I base the above on the fact that I moved to the US (from Kenya) in 1979,
and the music I remember  him producing at the time was decidedly secular.
As the article points out Cliff Richard is almost completely unknown in the
US so I did not hear about him for a while. It seems to me that the next
time I heard anything about him was the great conversion, heralded by a
song with a title like "Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?" Or
something like that.

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Yikes. Has BD made another embarrassing mistake? Readers, 
write in and enlighten both myself and Sami on this one.

HUGH GRANT FACES THE MUSIC

"What the hell were you thinking?"

With that question, American chat show host Jay Leno kicked off Hugh
Grant's first television interview since "the incident." Much to his
credit, Grant didn't skirt the issue, and although he seemed uncomfortable
at times and tired, his natural charm served him well.

"I think you know in life pretty much what's a good thing to do and what's
a bad thing. I did a bad thing and there you have it," he told Leno.

For those of you who may have been on holiday in Outer Mongolia, the star
of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" was arrested in Los Angeles last month
for "lewd conduct" with a prostitute named Divine Brown. Though it looks
as if he won't be serving any jail time, the publicity surrounding the
arrest could not have come at a worse time. His girlfriend, actress/model
Elizabeth Hurley, had just signed a contract to promote Estee Lauder
products and Grant's new movie, "Nine Months," is opening in the States
this week.

However, judging from the reaction of the studio audience, Grant's troubles
will more than likely soon be forgotten. The audience greeted him with
massive cheering and applause and the buzz on "Nine Months," which also
stars Tom Arnold and Robin Williams, is exceptionally good.

Grant seemed genuinely remorseful about having hurt the people he cares
about the most. In regards to his relationship with his girlfriend his
only comment was that "we're going to try and work it out."

"MELCHETT" HAS A HOME PAGE

It's common knowledge that there are a lot of celebrities hooked up to the
net. Jodie Foster is said to lurk on alt.showbiz.gossip and some people
claim that she even posts under an assumed name. Others such as Douglas
Adams, Terry Pratchett, and Dave Barry have been known to post using their
true identities.

Stephen Fry, however, has gone everyone else one better and created his own
homepage, which can be found at http://www.phantom.com/~stephenf. Entitled
"SJF's Confused Wanderings," it enables net surfers to download a picture
of the great man, e-mail him, and hey, he even takes the time to thank you
for stopping by. (And yes, he *does* answer his e-mail, but please be
patient as it sometimes takes him a couple of days.--ed.)

No, thank *you* Stephen, for creating such a lovely web site and giving us
the opportunity to join you in your "confused wanderings." Now tell us,
how do we get "Britcomedy Digest" added to your hotlist, huh? :)  Can we
grovel enough to get you to contribute an article? You know where to reach
us. :)

STEVE COOGAN SHOOTING NEXT SERIES

Steve Coogan has teamed up with his "Knowing Me, Knowing You" colleague
Patrick Marber for a new series set in the Lancastrian town of Ottle.
Coogan's familiar Lancastrian creations "Paul Calf" and "Pauline Calf"
will be joined by new ones in his first attempt at "narrational comedy."
According to an interview in The Guardian (July 10), the as of yet unnamed
series will be strongly character-driven, and each episode will be
directed in a completely different style by Geoff Posner. Posner has
worked with Harry Enfield, French and Saunders, Victoria Wood and Josie
Lawrence. Watch for a review of this BBC 2 series in upcoming issues of
BD.
 
BRAVO TO BRAVO

Viewers of the Bravo network are being treated this month to classic British
comedy from the vaults of Ealing Studio. Friday nights in July have been
reserved for such memorable films as "The Lady-killers," with Alec Guinness
and Peter Sellers, "The Green Man" with Alastair Sim, "The Lavender Hill
Mob" with Alec Guinness, plus "School For Scoundrels" with Ian Carmichael
and Terry-Thomas.

Sadly, films are no longer made at Ealing but set your VCR and you'll be
able to preserve for posterity classic comedy from this once-great studio.

MORECAMBE TO BE SITE OF COMEDY MUSEUM

Continuing our series "Unsung Heroes of British Comedy," we have the story
of Jeremy Gomm, editor-in-chief of Lancaster and Morecambe newspapers. Mr.
Gomm has devised a plan for Britain's first National Museum of Comedy and
Laughter.

A charitable trust has been established to obtain and administer funding
for this multi-million pound celebration of the British sense of humour.
Much of the money is expected to come from the Arts Council, the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, and the Millenium Commission.

"Comedy is an essential element of the British way of life," Mr. Gomm said.
"It is part of our national character and deserves a place in the nation's
heritage. Yet there is no national archive of comedy material, no centre
of comic studies, nowhere to learn about our comic heritage. The National
Museum of Comedy will change all that."

The proposed museum will be associated with Lancaster University, whose
honorary graduates include Eric Morecambe, Thora Hird, and Victoria Wood.
The plan has the support of the university officials as well as the local
council and, if all goes well, will be located on the Morecambe sea front.

DONALD SINCLAIR DIES

Donald Sinclair, the man who was the basis for the character of "Siegfried
Farnon" in James Herriot's "All Creatures Great and Small," died
Wednesday, July 5, at the age of 84. James Herriot passed away only four
months earlier.

DAVID LETTERMAN, WHIPPING-BOY FOR REC.ARTS.TV.UK

by Kristin C. Sabo <sabo@rouge.phys.lsu.edu>

Letterman went continental recently. And true to the new CBS Dave, "The
Late Show" caravan rolled into London amid pomp, press, and paparazzi. By
the time Dave began broadcasting across the pond, there were few in Great
Britain who hadn't heard that a week of Letterman in London was underway.

I haven't a clue as to the exact number of Britains that actually tuned DL
in, but a reasonably large amount of regulars in the rec.arts.tv.uk forum
on USENET certainly took a gander at Diamond Dave. Apparently they did not
like what they saw for the most part -- at least those who voiced an
opinion right away definitely didn't. "Letterman in London was dire", the
subject line pronounced. Having seen a bit of the imported Dave myself, I
read the follow-up comments in hope of finding an explanation for the
judgment. Oh boy...

Did I just say "comments"? Comments would have been appropriate. After all,
USENET is an open forum, fielding opinions and fostering communication and
discussion among a wide range of international computer users. Consensus
is not necessarily the goal of a dialogue on USENET. Understanding reason
and motivation certainly is, and as the majority of USENET participants
are college educated, one expects for the most part a certain rationality
in a post. This at least in theory, and one is usually rewarded in
practice.

Such were my expectations regarding the UK rec.arts.tv.uk analysis of
Dave-Across-The-Pond.

What I actually saw there completely shocked me. Initial reaction slammed
old Dave big-time. Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion... but I
wasn't prepared for such severe negativity, often levelled without
explanation or rationale.

Then it got nasty.

"What a waste of the [tv] license fee", and "I cannot believe Americans
watch this crap."

Nasty became ugly. One British gentleman stated that if Letterman was
America's idea of humor, then it was best that we Americans keep stabbing
and killing one another in the streets. Another writer claimed that DL was
incredibly racist -- she couldn't see how we could tolerate such a bigot.
A yet different thread preached the arguable "fact" that Americans have
taken the British version of irony and crudely shoved it well over the
top, and in fact we do this with *everything* we get our American hands
upon...

The tirade was at best snobbish and hostile, at worst hypocritical. And
amazingly popular, based on the number of those who jumped on the
bandwagon. Oh no, we've never seen the British make racist jokes about the
French, Italians, Americans, Germans, and even the Welsh, have we? Nor do
the British have anything even approaching the 'in-jokiness' of "The Late
Show"... right? In fact, UK television has had its own "Late Show," a
horrid little thing called "Noel's House Party." You want your continental
Letterman, insipid in-jokes and all? Check out Mr. Noel Edmonds sometime.
Yes, America has its share of garbage television, but we aren't the only
ones, mate.

Other USENET posts asserted that all of America tunes into "The Late Show".
In reality, Dave typically garners a 4.5 share -- about 4 million viewers,
you can do the math to determine what percent of US televisions are
actually watching our national in-joke. Meanwhile, Noel had one of five UK
sets tuned in. That's 20% of all UK televisions. Bad as so many of the
'netters claimed the House Party was, a substantial fraction of the UK
viewing public watched it. Now, I find the attraction of "Noel's House
Party" completely incomprehensible, but I would never extrapolate about
the British television industry based solely upon "Noel's House Party".
And wishing the deaths of Britains based upon a perceived impaired
national sense of humor? (much less wishing anyone's expiration, period) 
Uh huh... one might as well slap a big, neon sign reading "egotistical
paranoid lunatic" on one's forehead.

To witness rec.arts.tv.uk use David Letterman as an excuse to air their
anti-American sentiments was frustrating. There were actually a few posts 
that contained discussion and analysis- some actually admitted they liked 
Letterman- but for the most part, nobody pointed out that a shark-feeding 
thread, with Americans as bait, had begun. So on it went.

I realize DL will have limited appeal to a foreign audience. Heck, it's not
exactly hurting me if no one likes DL a bit. Yet I fail to realize why one
show caused such an unfounded outburst of hostility towards Americans.
It's fairly clear that the King of Late Night's appearance in London
certainly wasn't the direct cause of the tirade, just appeared to be a
good excuse to unleash it. And I wonder why... why all this anger from
people who share far more with us than they care to admit at times? I have
quite a few friends on the other side of the pond; I admire many an aspect
of British culture as do others over here. Witness the popularity of UK
television and the pledges it generates month after month on PBS. Then
there is the American preoccupation with the Royals, the popularity an
actor with 'the accent' often achieves in American media... and on and on.
America likes Great Britain -- a lot. For some reason I believed the
sentiment to be mutual. The wildly- escalating USENET attack upon 'the
Americans' hurt, confused, and disappointed me. And I do not understand
it; I expect I never will.

And so one has to wonder, what might cause this monster to rear its head
again?

                        Finally: Death Fish II ;-)
                             By Rob Putnam
                      <rputnam@midway.uchicago.edu>

The long awaited follow-up film to John Cleese's 1990 hit "A Fish Called
Wanda" is finally underway. Cleese, along with Wanda stars Jamie Lee
Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin, began filming "Fierce Creatures,"
this spring. The script has been over two years in the writing.

Although this is referred to by many as a sequel to "Wanda" (read "Death
Fish II"), it is, in Kline's words, "an equal, not a sequel." I don't mind
saying I'm glad that Cleese, in his wisdom, saw fit to leave "Wanda" well
enough alone. I count it among my favorite films, and I wouldn't like to
see its memory detracted from by trying to enhance an already perfect
story. But I digress.

Perhaps in a conscious effort to disassociate "Fierce Creatures" from
"Wanda," Cleese has taken pains to cast the actors in an altogether
different light than they appeared in "Wanda." Cleese plays an ex-Hong
Kong police officer, who, in his words, "has got a lot more balls than old
Archie had in 'Wanda,' but isn't really very romantic in his attitudes"
(Willman, 1994). Palin, in an about-face, is cast as a person who seems to
never stop chattering; Curtis is cast as a hot-shot executive, and Kline
has dual roles of rich guy and his marketing professional nephew. Beyond
this, I will reveal nothing of the plot (largely because that's all I know
of it). In fact, I will actively avoid learning more of it, as I love
surprises. I've come to expect some wonderful surprises from him, and so
far, I haven't been let down.

Some of you may recall that "Wanda" operated at a budget of $7.5 million.
In view of it's $190 million international earnings, I'd call that money
well spent.

"Fierce Creatures" is written by John Cleese and Iain Johnstone, and
co-produced by Michael Shamberg (who past works include "Wanda" and "Pulp
Fiction"). Interestingly, "Fierce Creatures" is directed by Robert Young,
who has directed Cleese in over 50 television commercials. "Wanda"
director Charles Crichton, now aged 85, is helping with the script.
"Fierce Creatures" is being produced by MGM/Universal.

THUMB SIDEWAYS
Feature Review: The Other Side of Chris Barrie
June 20-29, 1995

I caught Chris Barrie's one-man show at the Reading Hexagon -- a night he'd
probably like to forget. Amongst microphone problems and faulty
pre-recorded music, Barrie ("Red Dwarf," "The Brittas Empire") managed to
plod through 2 hours of skits, song, and stand-up. Supported by an
excellent cast of three women (one of whom is his girlfriend) and one man,
the troupe managed to entertain even when the gags were predictable and
fell flat.

There were three songs, the most audience-pleasing being the finale when
Barrie came out dressed as "Gordon Brittas" and sang (and danced!) about
the benefits of exercise. The cast even tried, in vain, to get the
audience out of their seats to participate in the aerobics.

Another highlight came during one of the three stand-up bits. I say
"stand-up" but it was really much more rough than that; Barrie talked to
the audience in an intimate way that didn't feel like the pat spiel of a
stand-up comedian. Barrie opened, "A lot of people have been coming up to
me after the show and asking why there hasn't been any Red Dwarf in the
show." (Huge audience applause.) "Well, it's a little difficult to
transport an entire set and cast onto the stage of the Reading Hexagon
..." But he responded to audience cheers by doing a hilarious routine
(which seemed off-the-cuff) where he performed a typical plot, poking fun
at the predictability of each character's lines.

It went *roughly* like this:

KRYTEN: "Sir," (audience cheers/laughs) "Sir, there is an extra-terrestrial
being approaching the ship. What should we do?"

RIMMER: "KRYTEN!" [Chris breaks in with a smile, "That's me."] "KRYTEN!
We've got to destroy it before it destroys us!"

CAT: "OOOOOOOOWWWW!" [twirling around] "A new life form? Let's see if I can
have SEX with it! Yeah, I'm so excited, all SIX of my nipples are
*tingling*..."

LISTER: "Hol, can you give us a reading on it?"

HOLLY: "Oh... wot? Uh..."

KRYTEN: "Holly, I thought you'd left after season 2 ..." [Barrie: "Probably
the biggest mistake of his career." Audience laughs, then realizes how
mean that is, and Barrie winces along with them.]

All in all, I'm not sure the night was worth it; if you're not a "Red
Dwarf"/"Brittas Empire" fan (and this is not an either/or stipulation --
you must be wildly into *both*), save your tenner and rent a movie
instead. Watching "the other side of Barrie" with anything less than a
oh-my-god-I'm-seeing-him-live-in-the-flesh mind-set is just not worth it.

THUMBS UP
Men Behaving Badly
9:30 PM Thursdays BBC 1

The first series this show ran, everyone said it was crap. Now it's the
darling of the comedy line-up Thursday nights. The show takes a tired
format -- two loser bachelor boys and their misguided attempts at running
their lives -- and actually makes it feel new, partly due to the writing
and partly due to the wonderful actors. Tune in for an instant self-esteem
boost.

THUMBS UP
Terry Pratchett's "The Wyrd Sisters"
11 PM Thursdays Radio 4

With Sheila Hancock, Lynda Baron, and Deborah Berlin. This is the first
radio-adaptation of a Terry Pratchett novel; so far, this series is doing
the disc-world novel justice. Don't miss it and turn the lights off for a
creepy experience.

THUMBS UP
The All-New Alexei Sayle Show 2
9:30 PM Fridays BBC2

Alexei Sayle is actually funny in this series, as he relies more on an
adept supporting cast and writers than on dominating the show with his
walking/talking to the camera format that he's relied on in the past. One
episode spoofs comic-book hero Superman by plunking him down in a coal

BLACK ADDER: THE PILOT -- a summary and review
----------------------------------------------
by Steve Roberts <SteveR@ppr.tv.bbc.co.uk>, Steve Phillips 
<eec@portia.umds.ac.uk>, and Michelle Street <mtstreet@soltec.com>.

Incredible as it may seem, the pilot of "Blackadder" was actually recorded
thirteen years ago.  Though not rip-roaringly funny, it is nevertheless a
fascinating television document in its own right and definitely worthy of
a television showing or video release.

The script, credited to Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, begins with the
following narration:

"It is Europe, 400 years ago. In Spain, war rages, as Christians from every
land fight off the threatening terror of Turkish invasion.

The French... are in uneasy peace. But in England, under the tutelage of a
powerful king, the Ship of State ploughs a steady course as the court
awaits the Queen's birthday and the return of a Scottish hero from the
war... "

The show then opens with Prince Henry, the King, and the Queen discussing
the war with the Spanish.   They hope it will soon be over so they can get
on with fighting the French. The Queen is in high spirits, as it is her
birthday and she has been given the county of Shropshire as a present.

Prince Edmund is in his chambers with his servants Percy and Baldrick.  He
is clearly unhappy about the task he has been given, which is to arrange
the festivities for both the Queen's birthday and the return of the
Scottish hero McAngus to the court.  He refers to his brother Henry as
"the bastard." Baldrick points out that if Henry actually was a bastard,
Edmund would one day be King. When he finds out that the eunuchs scheduled
to appear have cancelled, Edmund decides to have them executed. ("This is
a Royal command performance -- there are only two options. Either you do
it, or you don't do it. If you do it, you don't get paid. If you don't do
it, you get beheaded.")

Later -- the main hall. The Scottish hero, McAngus, appears. It is clear
that Edmund treats him with contempt, feeling that slaughtering a few
Turks is not very heroic. He is stunned when the King gives all Edmund's
lands in Scotland to McAngus.

Edmund's Chambers -- Edmund is furious. He, Percy and Baldrick plot to kill
McAngus. Percy warns that the King will cut Edmund off if he thinks he has
deliberately killed McAngus, so they agree to make it look like an
accident. Baldrick suggests putting McAngus's head in the mouth of a
cannon and firing it, but Edmund dismisses this as feeble.

McAngus's Room -- Edmund enters looking for McAngus, but the room is empty.
He finds a spiked Turkish helmet on the table and tries it on, but it gets
stuck. Hearing someone approaching, he hides behind the door. McAngus
enters, followed by the Queen. McAngus tells the Queen that his father
sends her his regards -- they used to know each other very well! The Queen
leaves, and McAngus discovers Edmund. They manage to get the helmet off,
and Edmund invites McAngus to act as the Scotsman in the play "The Death
of the Scotsman," to be performed for the Queens birthday.

The main hall, later that evening -- They are about to start the play, when
they discover that McAngus is drunk. Percy and Baldrick begin the play,
and are later joined by Edmund and McAngus. In the play, McAngus insults
the Queen, then stabs Edmund with a fake telescopic sword. He is sentenced
to be hung from the gallows. Leaving the stage, Edmund instructs Percy and
Baldrick to remove the safety hook from the gallows, and warns them that
whatever happens, if the Scotsman lives, they will die.

Off-stage, McAngus tells Edmund about hidden love letters from the Queen to
McAngus's father, casting doubts on the lineage of Prince Henry. McAngus
is back on stage about to be hanged before Edmund realises he needs him
alive to show him the letters. He tries to stop the hanging from off-stage
by cutting the noose with a spear, but it fails, so in a last-ditch
attempt, he throws a sheet over his head, and enters the stage as the
ghost of the Prince. He pleads mercy for the Scotsman, but Percy and
Baldrick, mindful of his previous threat, are determined to carry out the
execution. A comic fight sequence ensues, which ends with Edmund
inadvertently hanging McAngus himself, but then holding him up to stop him
choking.

Later, in McAngus's room -- A gleeful Edmund is shown the love letters that
his mother wrote. He instructs Baldrick to have the court assembled in the
morning.

The main hall, the following morning -- Edmund tells everyone about the
letters, which are dated November and December 1526. He begins to falter
as he realises that this was nine months AFTER Henry's birth, but nine
months BEFORE his own -- it is he who is the bastard, not Henry! McAngus
is as surprised at this revelation as Edmund is. Edmund tries to pretend
that McAngus has forged the letters, and challenges him to a duel -- to
the death. Edmund instructs Baldrick to get the fake telescopic sword, but
Percy gives Edmund the fake instead. There is a big fight, which
culminates in Edmund stabbing McAngus with the fake sword. On finding out
that Edmund tried to set him up with the fake sword, McAngus is furious
and is about to kill Edmund, when the King begs him for clemency. McAngus
agrees, but only if Edmund begs for mercy, which he does.

Later, in the King's chambers -- The King, Queen and Henry are discussing
the letters, which apparently turned out to be French forgeries. Edmund
and McAngus are now supposed to be the best of friends. However, up on the
tower, McAngus is peering down the barrel of a large cannon, at Edmund's
request. Back in the King's chambers, a loud bang is heard. Edmund comes
rushing in to announce that there has been a terrible accident -- as
everyone else leaves the room, he turns to the camera, and waves both fists
in triumph...

The final shot is of the family coat of arms, inscribed with the motto:

        "Veni Vidi Castratavi Illegitimos."

This very roughly translates as:

        "I came, I saw, I castrated the bastards!"

No Director credit is given, presumably this was also Posner.
 
This episode was re-made as "Born to be King," which is fairly similar to
the pilot. However, in the transmitted version, McAngus clearly realises
that the letters cast doubt over Edmund rather than Henry (Harry) and is
deliberately setting him up, whereas in the pilot it comes as a complete
surprise to him.

Atkinson's performance as Edmund is somewhere between the portrayal in
series one and that of the latter series, although the strong sarcasm is
missing. If you realise that what makes the series 2-4 character work *is*
the sarcastic/sardonic attitude, you'll see that the character here is
rather thinly drawn and ambiguous. In fitting with the harsher, brasher
image -- gone is the pudding-basin haircut, to be replaced by tight curls.
Such is the change in the character that the idiocy of the
head-stuck-in-the-helmet slapstick, whilst fine for the re-make, is out of
place here.

The biggest let-down by far in this pilot is the actor playing Baldrick.
Tony Robinson is not exactly Olivier but having somebody else play the
part reveals just how missed he is. The blonde-haired Philip Fox fails
miserably on every level but the character is only weakly sketched in the
script so he cannot be blamed for all the shortcomings.

The other major casting change is the King's part. Instead of Brian
Blessed, John Savalent turns in a more reserved and thoughtful performance
(I was never a fan of Blessed's stock-in-trade "shouting kings" anyhow).

A criticism, which can also be levelled at most of the first series proper,
is that the plot is over-complicated. Indeed, during the performance of
"The Death Of A Scotsman" play, it's quite difficult to work out what is
going on.  The production team must have realised this, hence the
re-working and simplifying of this scene prior to the re-make.

The pilot also suffers from not having the dramatic theme music of the
first series, although the opening silhouetted castle graphics are quite
effective.

Despite these criticisms, people who like the approach of the latter three
series will feel much more at home with the character of Blackadder here
than a random dip into any of the series one episodes.

INTRODUCTION

Spike Milligan is best known for writing and starring in the 1950's radio
show, "The Goon Show," with Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe. This show
influenced later comics such as Peter Cook, the members of Monty Python,
and "The Goodies." After the end of "The Goon Show," Spike created the "Q"
series for the BBC and wrote a play, "The Bed-Sitting Room." He has also
appeared in other stage plays and movies.

He started writing books in the 1960s and has accumulated more than 84
books to his writing resume. These include children's books, parodies,
autobiography, letters, novels, scripts, and poetry.
