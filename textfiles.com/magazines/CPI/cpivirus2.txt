                  Explanation of Viruses and Trojans Horses
                  -----------------------------------------
                            Written by Acid Phreak

    Like it's biological counterpart, a computer virus is an agent of
infection, insinuating itself into a program or disk and forcing its host
to replicate the virus code.  Hackers fascinated by the concept of "living"
code wrote the first viruses as projects or as pranks.  In the past few
years, however, a different kind of virus has become common, one that lives
up to an earlier meaning of the word:  in Latin, virus means poison.
    These new viruses incorporate features of another type of insidious
program called a Trojan horse.  Such a program masquerades as a useful
utility or product but wreaks havoc on your system when you run it.  It may
erase a few files, format your disk, steal secrets--anything software can
do, a Trojan horse can do.  A malicious virus can do all this then attempt
to replicate itself and infect other systems.
    The growing media coverage of the virus conceptand of specific viruse
has promoted the development of a new type of software.  Antivirus programs,
vaccines--they go by many names, but their purpose is to protect from virus
attack.  At present there are more antivirus programs than known viruses
(not for long).
    Some experts quibble about exactly what a virus is.  The most widely
known viruses, the IBM Xmas virus and the recent Internet virus, are not
viruses according to some experts because they do not infect other programs.
Others argue that every Trojan horse is a virus--one that depends completely
on people to spread it.

How They Reproduce:
-------------------
    Viruses can't travel without people.  Your PC will not become infected
unless someone runs an infected program on it, whether accidentally or on
purpose.  PC's are different from mainframe networks in this way--the
mainframe Internet virus spread by transmitting itself to other systems and
ordering them to execute it as a program.  That kind of active transmission
is not possible on a PC.
    Virus code reproduces by changing something in your system.  Some viruses
strike COMMAND.COM or the hidden system files.  Others, like the notorious
Pakistani-Brain virus, modify the boot sector of floppy disks.  Still others
attach themselves to any .COM or .EXE file.  In truth, any file on your
system that can be executed--whether it's a program, a device driver, an
overlay, or even a batch file--could be the target of a virus.
    When an infected program runs, the virus code usually executes first and
then transfers control to the original program.  The virus may immediately
infect other programs, or it may load itself into RAM and continue spreading.
If the virus can infect a file that will be used on another system, it has
succeeded.

What They Can Do:
-----------------
    Viruses go through two phases:  a replication phase and an action phase.
The action doesn't happen until a certain even occurs--perhaps reaching a
special date or running the virus a certain number of times.  It wouldn't
make sense for a virus to damage your system the first time it ran; it needs
some time to grow and spread first.
    The most vulnerable spot for a virus attack is your hard disk's file
allocation table (FAT).  This table tells DOS where every file's data resides
on the disk.  Without the FAT, the data's still there but DOS can't find it.
A virus could also preform a low-level format on some or all the tracks of
your hard disk, erase all files, or change the CMOS memory on AT-class
computers so that they don't recognize the hard disk.
    Most of the dangers involve data only, but it's even possible to burn
out a monochrome monitor with the right code.
    Some virus assaults are quite subtl.  One known virus finds four
consecutive digits on the screen and switches two.  Let's hope you're not
balancing the company's books when this one hits.  Others slow down system
operations or introduce serious errors.

        Ok,  wow!  You've just  invented  the most  incredibly nifty virus.  It
slices, it dices, it squshes,  it mushes (sorry Berke Breathed)  people's data!
But the only problem is, if you go around infecting every damn file,  some cute
software company is going to  start putting in  procedures that  checksum their
warez each time they run, which will make life for your infecting virus a total
bitch. Or somebody's going to come up with an incredibly nifty vaccination util
that will wipe it out. Because, i mean,  hey,  when disk space starts vanishing
suddenly in 500K chunks people tend to notice.  Especially people  like me that
rarely have more than 4096 bytes free on their HD anyway. Ok.  So you're saying
"wow, so what, I can make mine fool-proof", etc, etc. But wait! There's no need
to go around wasting your precious time when the answer is right there in front
of you! Think about it,  you could be putting that time into writing better and
more inovative viruses,  or you could be  worring about keeping  the file size,
the date & time, and the attributes the same.  With this system,  you only need
to infect one file, preferably one that's NOT a system file, but something that
will get run alot, and will be able  to load your nifty virus on a daily basis.
This system also doesn't take up any disk space, other than the loader. And the
loader could conceivably be under  16 bytes (damn near undetectable).  First of
all, you need to know what programs to infect. Now, everybody knows about using
COMMAND.COM and that's unoriginal anyway,  when there are other programs people
run all the time. Like DesqView  or Norton Utilities or  MASM or  a BBS file or
WordPerfect; you get the idea. Better still are dos commands like Format,  Link
or even compression utilities.  But you get the point. Besides,  who's going to
miss 16 bytes, right? Now, the good part: where to put the damn thing. One note
to the programmer:  This could get  tricky if  your virus  is over  2k or isn't
written in Assembly, but the size problem is easy enough, it would  be a simple
thing to break your virus  into parts and have  the parts load each  other into
the system so that you do eventually get the whole thing. The only problem with
using  languages besides assembly  is that it's  hard to  break them up into 2k
segments. If you want to infect floppys, or smaller disks, you'd be best off to
break your file into 512 byte segments, since they're easier to hide. But, hey,
in assembly, you can generate pretty  small programs that do alot, tho.  Ok, by
now you've probably figured  out that we're talking  about the part of the disk
called 'the slack'. Every disk that your computer uses is divided up into parts
called sectors, which are (in almost all cases) 512 bytes. But in larger disks,
and even in floppies,  keeping track of every single sector would be a complete
bitch. So the sectors  are bunched together  into groups  called 'clusters'. On
floppy disks,  clusters are  usually  two sectors,  or 1024 bytes,  and on hard
disks, they're typically 4096 bytes, or eight sectors.  Now think about it, you
have  programs on  your  hard disk,  and what are  the odds that they will have
sizes that always end up in increments of 4096? If I've  lost you,  think of it
this way: the file takes up a  bunch of  clusters,  but in  the last cluster it
uses, there is usually some 'slack', or space that isn't used by the file. This
space is between where the actual file ends and  where the actual cluster ends.
So, potentially, you can have up  to 4095 bytes of 'slack'  on a file on a hard
disk, or 1023 bytes of 'slack' on a floppy.  In fact, right now, run the Norton
program  'FS /S /T'  command from your root directory,  and subtract  the total
size of the files from the total disk space used. That's how much 'slack' space
is on your disk (a hell of alot, even on a floppy). To  use the slack,  all you
need to do  is to  find a  chunk of slack  big enough to  fit your  virus (or a
segment of your virus)  and use direct disk access (INT 13)  to put  your virus
there.  There is one minor  problem with this.  Any disk write to that  cluster
will overwrite the slack with 'garbage' from memory. This is because of the way
DOS manages it's disk I/O and it can't  be fixed without alot of hassles.  But,
there is a way around even this. And it involves a popular  (abeit outdated and
usually ineffectual) form of  virus protection called the READ-ONLY flag.  This
flag is the greatest friend  of this type of virus.  Because if the file is not
written to,  the last cluster is not written to, and voila!  Your virus is safe
from mischivious accidents.  And since the R-O flag doesn't  affect INT 13 disk
I/O, it won't be in your way. Also, check for programs with the SYSTEM flag set

because that has the same Read-only effect (even tho I haven't seen it written,
it's true that  if the  file is designated system,  DOS treats it as read-only,
whether the R-O flag is set or not).  The space after IBMBIOS.COM or IBMDOS.COM
in MS-DOS (not PC-DOS, it uses different files,  or so I am told; I've been too
lazy to find out myself) or a protected (!) COMMAND.COM  file in either type of
DOS would be ideal for this. All you have to do is then insert your loader into
some innocent-looking file, and you are in business.  All your loader has to do
is read  the sector into  the highest part of memory,  and do a far call to it.
Your virus cann then go  about waiting  for floppy disks  to infect,  and place
loaders on any available executable file on the disk. Sound pretty neet? It is!
Anyway, have fun, and be sure to upload your virus, along with a README file on
how it works to CPI  Headquarters so we  can check it out!  And remember: don't
target P/H/P boards  (that's Phreak/Hack/Pirate boards) with ANY virus. Even if
the Sysop is a leech and you want to  shove his balls down his throat.  Because
if all the PHP boards go down (especially members of CPI), who the hell can you
go to for all  these nifty  virus ideas?  And besides,  it's betraying your own
people,  which  is uncool even  if you  are an anarchist.  So, target uncool PD
boards, or your  boss's computer  or whatever,  but don't attack  your friends.
Other than that, have phun, and phuck it up!

            CPI Virus Standards - Protect yourself and your friends

*******************************************************************************

        One of the  main problems with viruses is that  once you set one loose,
it is no longer under your control.  I propose to stop this by introducing some
standards of  virus writing that will  enable them to  be deactivated  whenever
they enter a 'friendly' (CPI) system.  In the long run,  even the author of the
virus is not immune to being attacked. The following are what I have termed the
CPI standards for writing viruses.  They will allow a virus to easily check any
system they are  being run on  for a type of 'identity badge'.  If it is found,
the virus will  not infect the  system it is being run on.  The other standards
are mostly written around this.

CPI Standards for writing viruses -

        1 - The virus will have  an 'active  period' and an  'inactive period'.
            The active periods will be no more than one year in length (to make
            it more difficult to discover the virus). You may release different
            versions of your virus  with different 'active periods'.  It is not
            recommended that your  virus deactivate itself after the set active
            period, as this would enable  people to deactivate viruses by using
            their computer with the date set  to 2069 or something.  It is also
            required  that  activation  periods  begin on January 1  and end on
            December 31. This will coincide  with the changing  identity codes.

        2 - The virus will check for an  identity code by  executing Interrrupt
            12h  with the  following register  settings:  AX - 4350, BX - 4920,
            CX - AB46, DX - 554E.  If the system  is  friendly, then a  pointer
            will be returned in CX:DX to an ASCIIZ (0-terminated) string  which
            will have different contents in different years.  The codes are not
            to be included in any text file,  and should only  be given through
            E-mail on CPI affiliated systems.  You can always ask me by sending
            me  mail at  The Andromeda Strain BBS.  If a system  is detected as
            friendly, the virus will not attempt to infect or damage it, but it
            is ok  to display a  little  greeting message  about  how lucky the
            user was.

        3 - We very much encourage you to upload your virus, along with a breif
            description on the  workings into the  CPI section at The Andromeda
            Strain BBS.  Only CPI members  will know about your virus.  This is
            so that CPI members  can share techniques and  it also allows us to
            verify that  the identity check works.  If we see  any improvements
            that could be made, such as ways to streamline code, better ways of
            spreading, etc. we will inform you so that you can make the changes
            if you wish.

        4 - It is also suggested that you use ADS standard for virus storage on
            infected disks.  This meathod uses disk slack space for storage and
            is more thoroughly described in a previous text file by me. I think
            that this is the most effective  and invisible way to store viruli.

        5 - A list of CPI-Standard  viruli will be  avaliable at all times from
            The Andromeda Strain BBS, to CPI users.  Identity strings will also
            be available to anyone in CPI, or anyone who uploads source code to
            a virus which is 100%  complete except for  the Identity string (it
            must be written to CPI-Standards). Non-CPI members who do this will

 Well well, here it is... I call it AIDS... It infects all COM files, but it is
 not perfect, so it will also change the date/time stamp to the current system.
 Plus, any READ-ONLY attributes will ward this virus off, it doesn't like them!

 Anyway, this virus was originally named NUMBER ONE, and I modified the code so
