A very few words:::

	Again, sorry that I've been away from writing for so long (last
issue was april 89), but spending a lot of time away from home can
sometimes do that to a person...  There are literally megabytes of input
saved between the last issue and this, giving us many more months of
masterful mirth once I get around to putting it into a format that is
functional and etc...

	This means "The Humus Report" is still alive and in no apparent
danger of going down permanently unless I die or the world turns humourless
for months on end...  While General Bush and his trusty sidekick, "Pancho"
Quayle deal marked cards to the world at large, I'll be out there reporting
on it all, the bizarre, the unusual, the words straight from the horse's
(pick an end, any end)...  Who knows?  Some of it might even be true...  :)

	We can thank "The Words for Today, Boys and Girls" (listen for Jack
Nicholson doing his Mr Rogers imitation in the background), Murphy, Durham
(North Carolina), a cast of tens, legislators everywhere, and Burger King
for making it exceptionally easy to find good fertilizings...

	So, without further adieu, on with the show...

	The words George Carlin made famous are words that virtually
everyone has heard, words virtually every one of us has *used* from time to
time, some of us more often than others.  They are not "politic" words,
though, and that sometimes bothers me.  Why should such useful words find
such hypocrisy over their use?

	For those of you nestled in places where "such words" are deemed
inappropriate, I will play the hypocrite and allow you the use of the
following list when those words become truly necessary...

	Management wishes to bring to the attention of all personnel, that
some individuals have been using abusive language in the exchange of normal
verbal communications with relation to the performance of routine

originality of our fellow employees to alleviate frustration and provide a
clearer, precise, and effective means of communicatoin to one another and
not offend those individuals with sensitive ears that may be within hearing

	To preclude mistaking the communication codes with department
numbers and telephone extensions, management has assigned 800 and 900

Editor's Note:  Of course, there is also the following, for those that may
not have understood any of the previous...  :)

	-----

	Will You Just Fuckin' Read This, Please?

	Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in the
English language today is the word "fuck."  It is one magical word which,
JUST BY ITS SOUND, can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.  "Fuck"
comes from the German word "Frigon," meaning "whoopee."

	In language, "fuck" falls into many grammatical categories.  It can
be used as a verb, transitive ("John fucked Mary") and intransitive ("Mary
was fucked"), as a noun ("Mary is a fine fuck"), and as an adjective ("Mary
is fucking rad").

	From this, you can see that there are not many words with the
versatility of "fuck."  Besides its sexual connotation, this lovely word can
be used to describe many situations, such as:

	Aggression	Fuck you!
	Confusion	What the fuck?
	Curiosity	What the fuck IS it?
	Desire		I'd love to fuck HER!
	Despair		Fucked again.
	Difficulty	Fuck it, Shit!
	Dismay		Oh, fuck it!
	Displeasure	What the fuck is going on?
	Fraud		I got fucked!
	Incompetence	He's all fucked up!
	Laziness	He's a fuck off!
	Over-partying	I'm WAY too fucked up!
	Passivity	Fuck me!
	Partying	Let's get fucked up!
	Philosophical	Who gives a fuck?
	Pleasure	That's fuckin' great!
	Rebellion	I don't give a fuck!
	Sexuality	What a great fuck!
	Size/Surprise	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!
	Trouble		I guess I'm fucked now!

It can be used:
	to describe ANATOMY:	He's really a fucking asshole!
	to tell TIME:		It's five-fucking-thirty!
	in BUSINESS:		How did I get this fucking job?
	MATERNALLY:		He's a fucking asshole!
	NAUTICALLY:		Fuck the Admiral!
	POLITICALLY:		Fuck Reagan!
	to start FRIENDSHIPS:	Let's fuck, bitch!
	in FINANCE:		Here's your five fucking bucks!
	in PSYCHOLOGY:		He's fucking crazy!

	The mind boggles at the many more creative forms of this multi-
functional word.  How can anyone be offended when you say "fuck?"

	So today, tell someone...  FUCK YOU!

	A nun walks into a liquor store, walks up to the counter and says to
the cashier, "I want a bottle of your strongest Vodka, please"

	The man seems somewhat shocked and replies with, "But sister, isn't
that kind of strong drink for someone of your order?"

	The nun replies with, "Oh no.  It's not for me!  It's for the poor
dear Mother Superior.  It's to clear her constipation."

	The man is relieved, and wraps the bottle up for the nun and wishes
her a good day.  A few hours later, he closes up the shop, and starts on his
way home.  He walks a few blocks, when he happens to stumble upon the nun,
laying next to a building, with the bottle of vodka in her hand.  He runs up
to her an exclaims, "Dear sister, I thought you said that the bottle of
booze was for your poor Mother Superior's constipation?"

	"It is," the nun manages to slur.
	"So why are you drinking it," asks the obviously confused man.

	"Are you stupid?  Do you realize what she is going to do when she
SEES me like this?"

	Problem:  The question arose while poring over the following cash
register receipt from Burger King, "Why is the word 'WHOPPER' misspelled?":

	'-------------------------'

	Hypotheses:

	.1.  Fields are a maximum of 6 characters long.
		Rejected:  'CHICKEN' extends into column 7.

	.2.  Whoever programmed the system can't spell properly.
		Rejected:  Burger King management would damn well make sure
that the names of their products were spelled correctly.  Also, other
anomalies exist, i.e., the blanks in the words "ONLY" and "RETURN," and the
left margin is ragged.

	.3.  Burger King cash registers can only print certain characters in
certain columns, forcing the odd spelling and odd format.  This hypothesis
seems to have the most merit.  The original receipt shows that the printing
mechanism prints characters from fully-formed images, not in a dot-matrix
form.  Thus we can visualize the print mechanism as consisting of a rotating
wheel for each column.  Since to fit all 36 alphamers on each wheel would
probably give them too great a diameter to be practical, only a selected
subset of the letters are put on each wheel, and the spelling and
positioning of the item names has to be adjusted to fit this scheme.

	It would appear that Burger King even chooses the names for new
products with the design of their cash registers in mind.  For example,
their fish sandwich is called the "Whaler," which is easily printed using
the W, H, E, and R from 'WHOPER', the A from 'EAT IN' and the 'L' from 'ONL
Y'.  However, it could just have easily been called 'FISH' by taking the F
in 'FRIES', the I in 'DIET', and the S and H from 'CASH', so it appears that
even this hypothesis is a little weak.

	Any other hypotheses and further research by readers would be
welcomed...

	Subject:  The reason why WHOPPER is spelled WHOPER
	To:  Brent Britton <BRENT@MAINE>
	From:  Barry D.  Gates <CS23124@MAINE>
	Date:  Fri, 1 Mar 1985 04:53 EST

	It has come to my attention that a great furor has been aroused in
the field of computer academia over the spelling of the word WHOPPER on
receipts from Burger King.  First of all, it should be pointed out that I do
not, as a normal matter of habit, frequent such substandard eateries as this
when a choice does exist, but at one occasion I did happen to stop into one
of fast food establishments with several of my academic colleagues during
this past summer and we happened to notice these strange encryptic
printouts.

	After staring at these strange writings for a few minutes we noticed
the similarity between our cash receipts and xediting a file that had been
sent from a Vax (small mainframe computer, usually dedicated to tasks such
as graphics which deserve to be done on such machines) using the
SEND/FILE/BINARY command.  The Vax, as most of you should know, communicates
with an extended version of the ASCII character set, whereas the IBM uses
the EBCDIC character set.  This translation from one set to another allows
some characters to be translated the into gibberish, others into different
characters, and still others to remain unchanged.

	It is from this observation that I was able to determine the reason
for the strange and somewhat cryptic spellings on Burger King receipts.  As
you all know, the EBCDIC character set is the successor to an older
character set called BCD.  This BCD character set was used by IBM in its
computers back in the late 1950s/early 1960s in the IBM 1400-series
computers.  From a back issue of the Scientific American (December 1962 to
be exact), I discovered a company by the name of Inter-Code Business Machine
Company who had built an extension to the BCD character set for use in their
computer, the SS-20.  The company was declared bankrupt after selling less
than 12 computers, and they were left with over 12,000 more of these
machines in stock.  The name of their character set was called BCDCB.  One
of the best aspects of their computer was that it was all capable of being
housed in a box no larger than a terminal.

	At the same time that ICBM was going bankrupt, Burger King had just
come into the fast food market and was in need of tax shelters.  In a deal
to help pay ICBM's creditors, they agreed to purchase the remaining stock of
SS-20s from ICBM for the cost of $20 (a dollar could buy a lot more back in
the old days).  As time went on, Burger King never really did anything with
their $20 investment, and the SS-20s remained stockpiled in one of Burger
King's wharehouses.

	Then came the age of Computerized Cash Registers.

	Burger King was in bad economic straights back in 1973 when they
were losing massive numbers of customers to an Irish-American hamburger
chain (which shall also remain nameless).  They also wished to get some new
electronic cash registers for their counters.  An old janitor at Burger King
happened to stumble on the old SS-20s one day, and one of the head
programmers at Burger King came up with a great idea.  Why not take an old
SS-20, put an aluminum box around it and put a keypad on top and use the
device as a cash register (you will remember that ICBM was ahead of its time
in making computers small).

	The idea worked;  it worked fabulously, in fact.  However, several
years later, they decided to add a receipt printer to the whole combo.  Here
is where our trouble is.  As I had mentioned before, BCD and BCDCB were not
quite the same.  Burger King, however, did not realize this until after they
had bought the 12,000 BCD receipt printers they thought they needed.  They
also did not realize this fact until after they had mounted all 12,000
printers onto their cash registers.

	The SS-20s had a rather odd character-out routine, which would
switch to graphics mode whenever to identical characters were sent in
succession.  The letter 'R' also could cause problems, because that was how
you returned from graphics mode back into text mode (the process of
converting back to text mode is rather slow on these machines however, and
usually takes about as much time as it takes to send another 5 characters).

	So, as you can see the word WHOPPER is actually what the SS-20 is
printing, but the second 'P' would put the SS-20s normal display device (the
GLCM) into graphics mode.  Since a receipt printer does not have a graphics
mode, it just ignores the strange code it gets entirely.  The second problem
I just mentioned also explains why the string 'FRENCH FRIES' appears as
'FFRIES' on a Burger King receipt tape.

	I have, over this past break, worked out the translation code from
BCDCB into either BCD, EBCDIC or ASCII.  If anyone should happen to want
this program, I will be glad to send the source code along.  I also have
developed the code to make a Visual 550 act as a GLCM.  Together, these are
the start of a really excellent graphics package.  If you wish to know how
to make your Visual 550 act as a GLCM, please give me a call and I will
drive to your installation and personally give your Visual its 'test
flight'.

	Oh, well.  I have to run now.  I hope this clears up any problems
that might have developed.  Later, Barry...

	Signs of the Times

	On 13 October 1944, the Durham (North Carolina) Sun reported that a
Durhamite had been brought before a Judge Wison in traffic court for having
parked his car on a restricted street right in front of a sign that read "No
Stoping."

	Rather than pleading guilty, the defendant argued that the missing
letter in the sign meant that he had not violated the letter of the law.
Brandishing a Webster's dictionary, he noted that stoping means:

	"extracting ore from a stope or, loosely, underground"

	"Your Honor," said the man, "I am a law-abiding citizen and I didn't
extract any ore from the area of the sign.  I move that the case be
dismissed."

	Acknowledging that the defendant hadn't done any illegal mining, the
judge declared the man not guilty and commented, "since this is Friday, the
13th, anything can happen, so I'll turn you loose."

	"No Stoping" is a blunderful example of the suspect signs and
botched billboards that dot the American landscape.  Here are some other
signs that need to be re-signed:

	At restaurant-gas stations throughout the nation:
	"Eat here and get gas"

	At a Sante Fe gas station:
	"We will sell gasoline to anyone in a glass container"

	In a New Hampshire jewelry store:
	"Ears pierced while you wait"

	In an New York restaurant:
	"Customers who consider our waitresses uncivil ought to see the
		manager"

	In a Michigan restaurant:
	"The early bird gets the worm!"
	"Special shoppers' luncheon before 11:00 AM"

	On a delicatessen wall:
	"Our best is none too good"

	On the wall of a Baltimore estate:
	"Trespassers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law --

	The city is looking out for its frogs, which leap in mean streets
teeming with sewer holes and enemy automobiles.  There is a new sign in
these parts to protect the creatures.  It reads:  "Frog Crossing."

	In recent weeks, many frogs were dying unnecessarily in city sewers
after leaping into the streets from the Schmeekle Reserve on the campus of
the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.  Once in the street, the frogs
could not leap over the curbs, so they would continue down the street where
many eventually fell to their deaths through sewer grates.

	At the request of reserve officials, the city took steps to increase
the longevity of the frogs.  City crews working on curb and street repair in
the area inserted "curb cuts," or little ramps in the curbs near the grates
for the frogs to walk up and head for nearby woods and ponds.

	The city also erected the "Frog Crossing" signs to alert motorists
to slow down for the creatures.

	"The signs are tongue-in-cheek," Stevens Point Mayor Scott Schultz
said, "but the city doesn't want to lose sight of relations between urban
and wildlife areas"

	Transportation officials of the Sunshine State have been embarrassed
by a huge blue sign welcoming visitors to "Floirda."
	"I think somebody
goofed," said Jo Hein, who lives just a short distance from the large sign
on US 90 in the community of Beulah, west of Pensacola.  "They don't know
how to spell."

	The sign, which greets visitors entering the state from Alabama,
says, "Welcome to Floirda.  The Sunshine State."  It is like 20 other
welcome signs between Jacksonville and Pensacola, save for the misspelling.

	"It sure don't give Florida much of a good advertisement," said
Hein's husband, Sylvester.  He said a businessman pointed out the error to
him.  "It don't speak good for us at all."

	Julian McCrary, a maintenance engineer for the Department of
Transportation, said the sign was erected Thursday by a worker who has put
up similar signs in the past.

	"You expect it to be right," the engineer said Tuesday.  "It's quite
embarrassing.  It's just an unfortunate mistake"

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

	A doctor, an engineer and a software developer were sitting up late
one night, drinking beer and conducting philosophical conversations.  They
deliberated for some time as to what, according to the Bible, would be
considered the oldest profession.

	"In Genesis," stated the doctor, "it says that when God created man,
he took the rib of Adam, and from it created Eve.  I would maintain that this
is a maneuver of surgical expertise, and therefore medicine would have to be
considered the oldest profession."  His two colleagues pondered this for
some time, and concluded that the doctor's logic was sound and they could
find no fault with it.

	"I would concur with your evidence," said the engineer, "but it also
says that on the first day God created order from the chaos.  I assert that
this is an engineering feat, and that, therefore, engineering is the oldest
profession."

	They considered this point for a while, and eventually agreed that
the engineer was correct in this statement.  "However, gentlemen," the
software developer interjected, "I'll have to take issue with both
arguments;  after all, from where do you think the chaos came in the first
place?"


...until next month...
