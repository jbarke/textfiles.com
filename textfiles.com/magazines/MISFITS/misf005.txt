                           Definition of a Twit
                           ---------- -- - ----
                           Ripped from Bbs Land

 o Twits love DOWNLOADING. Uploading is for simpletons who can't tell whether
   they are coming or going. If Twits designed modems, we'd all have one which
   downloads at 18.2 K-Baud, and uploads at 300 baud. If Twits wrote protocols,
   the smallest block they could receive would be 10 megs.

 o Twits can't READ or COUNT. This is evidenced by their total inability to
   comprehend System Rules, or Upload/Download Ratio's. But, for some
   strange reason, they can still use a computer.

   Because of this handicap, most Twits are unemployed. It is a miracle that
   most of them haven't been retained by the State to pick up trash on the
   expressways. They'd gladly volunteer for it, if it could be done with a
   modem and they were called "Remote-Trash Downloaders".

 o Twits feel that the proper way to leave a board is to drop the carrier.
   They do this because they don't want to waste their valuable time exiting
   via the "Goodbye" command, when they could spend that time calling another
   board.

 o Twits NEVER leave messages, unless it is rude, crude, or socially
   unacceptable. If an exception to this exists, it will probably be a
   creative one-liner such as "Hi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".
   Twits rarely reply to messages. Unless they enter a one-liner such as
   the one above.

 o Twits NEVER communicate with SysOps, unless it is to ask WHY such and such
   file is unavailable, demand access to the "Private Area's", or gripe about
   something. Mail from the SysOp is considered to be the electronic equivalent
   of "Junk-Mail", and should be ignored. In fact, there should be some form
   of law to stop it from being written.

 o Twits NEVER pay for access to a computer system. They see themselves as
   latter-day "Robin-Hoods", taking from the rich (SysOps) and giving to the
   Poor (Themselves). Their motto: "If it isn't free, it isn't worth having."

 o Twits NEED multiple user names and logon passwords on each board they call.
   This is the measure of their Twit-dom, and reflects their true status in the
   Twit-community. A Twit with only ONE user name and logon password per board
   is a FAILURE, & faces censure and possible expulsion from their peer group.
   (It is no wonder that Twits exhibit schizo-tendancies).

 o Twits know EVERYTHING. Just ask them. But, it'd take a crow-bar and dynamite
   to get any useful information out of them. These self-professed "experts"
   will RARELY stoop so low as to assist someone who may genuinely need some
   help. After all, a REAL "hacker" never needs or asks for help.

 o A Twit would not be caught dead using their REAL NAME when calling a BBS.
   In fact, Twits refuse to leave anything more involved than a handle when
   registering with a BBS. (EVERYONE knows who "Slinky Toy" is!!!)

   The ONLY exception to this rule is that they will often use SOMEONE ELSE's
   real name. Or, they may use the name of a Heavy-Metal rock & roll group.
   (Imagine a system where everyone is named "Guns&Roses")

 o Twits NEVER register their Shareware. Cash is what they use to buy faster
   modems. Program Authors are neurotic-compulsives, and if they did not
   serve a purpose, Twits would have them abolished completely.

 o Twits ADORE Sprint, MCI, and other long-distance credit card numbers, IF
   they belong to someone else. This also applies to COMPUSERV, SOURCE, etc.
   Their motto is: "If you can't steal it, it can't be much fun".

 o A Twit is a "BBS Connoisseur".  They KNOW which BBS software is BEST and
   how your system SHOULD look and run. They will not hesitate to inform you
   if it fails to meet their demanding and rigid expectations. (They consider
   this a "Public Service") However,  they would NEVER trouble themselves to
   run their OWN bbs. That might take valuable time away from their duties as
   "Remotes" on the boards they spend all their waking moments calling.

 o Twits LOVE to page the SysOp, often just for the sheer hell of it. They are
   most fond of "Late-Night" paging. This is the perfect time for them to
   explain the infallable logic as to why they should be given Remote-SysOp
   access to your system. Their second most favored reason for wanting to chat
   is "Just checking to see if you were THERE!"

 o Twits cannot comprehend WHY the IBM program they just downloaded won't run
   on their Atari 800. After all, programs are programs, right? And, any fool
   knows that a 32K machine can hold a 200K program.

 o Twits can't TOLERATE seeing a command that they can't use. Their motto is
   "try, try again". If it didn't work the first time, it HAS to work on the
   second, third, fourth, etc. No self-respecting SysOp would intentionally
   offer them anything less than TOTAL ACCESS.

 o Twits are FASCINATED by DOS. Their quest for it rivals the search for the
   legendary "Holy-Grail". They MUST reach it, through their modem, or all is
   lost. What they would do with it if they reached it, is probably a lot like
   what a dog who chases cars would would do with one if he managed to catch
   it. (Pee on the tires?)

 o Twits are totally ENGROSSED by hardware. They can conceive of the most
   unborthodox, outrageous, and potentially lethal contraptions known on
   Earth. Occasionally, these "time-bombs" actually work. Any difficulties
   they experience with their computers will fall under the heading of
   "Miscegenation", or "Poetic Justice".

 o Twits CRAVE the LATEST version of "Goober-Pods", or "Space-Weenies". To
   reward the SysOp for access to such mega-byte gems, they will upload
   VALUABLE and USEFUL programs in return. Such as "Weasel-Stompers" for the
   Commodore-64, providing it is less than 10K in size.

 o A Twit NEVER uses applications programs, and NEVER writes programs.
   (Programs are what Twits DOWNLOAD, and most can just BARELY write or spell)
   Their motto: "If you don't need a joystick to play it, it isn't worth
   having".

 o A real Twit will FLATLY REFUSE to use ANY compression method on files they
   intend to upload. After all, SysOps sit and twiddle their thumbs waiting
   on something to do, and should be GRATEFUL that they get ANY uploads, EVER!
   They also refuse to upload documentation. (It is crutch for weak minds and
   the hallmark of the Geek)

 o Twits SUFFER if there are no "NEW" files on the system. There may be a
   correlation between "NEW" files and Twits, much as there is one which
   exists between dog-excrement and flies. The only difference is that flies
   usually leave after eating their fill. Twits don't.

 o Twits desperately NEED to become Remote-Sysops. They KNOW that EVERYONE
   else on the system has SysOp capabilities, and don't want to be excluded
   from all the fun! (Are all Twits created equal?)

 o Twits think that the "Caps Lock" key must be activated in order to properly
   leave a message on a board.  They think that their message is of such great
   importance that it must be screamed at everyone.

 o Occasionally an above average Twit who discovers that modeming can be a two
   way street will attempt to get around upload\download ratios by renaming the
   same program fifteen or twenty times and using it to fill the sysop's hard
   disk with redundant programs.  After all, rules were meant to be broken,
   right?




                     How to pass a lie detector test!
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                             by: The Misfits
                             05 - Jan - 1993


When someone hooks you up to a lie detector, they are measuring your physical
responses to psychological stimuli.  It's something like watching you to see if
you blush.  There are four levels they can measure.

1.  Your response when you are just sitting there, not being asked anything.

2.  Your response when you are asked a question you would have no reason to lie
about.  "What is your name?"

3.  Your response when asked a question they consider personal or
embarassing to most people.  "Have you ever wondered what it would be like
to have sex with your mother?"  I think only the government would have
enough nerve to actually do this.

4.  Your response to the questions they suspect you might lie about.

What they are looking for is whether your #4 responses are closer to #2 or #3,
and if the difference is significant with respect to #1.

If your response level to #3 is much higher than any of the others, you are
clearly telling the truth about #4.

If your responses to #1, #2, and #4 are low, and #3 is high, they think you
are telling the truth.

If your responses to #1, #2, #3, and #4 are all the same, they think that
you are either a psychopath or extremely well-adjusted and telling the
truth.

If your responses to #1 and #2 are low but #3 and #4 are high, they think
you are lying.

If your responses to #2, #3, and #4 are high, they think you are very
nervous and they call the result "inconclusive."

This last result is easiest for normal people to fake.  Just think about
something embarrasing every time they ask you a question.  Don't relax,
except between questions.

A more risky alternative would be to try to relax during the questions
you're going to lie about, but not during the "embarrasing" questions.  If
successful, this would produce the "normal truth" result they like the best.
If it failed, it would give the "lie" result.

If you take some sort of tranquilizer beforehand, you may be able to relax
enough to get the "psychopath" response.  It will probably not get you hired,
though.

One practice method would be to hook yourself up to an ohmmeter.  One wire
wrapped around your left index finger, the other wrapped around your right.
If the reading drops from (say) 100 K-Ohms to a third of that, you just
"lied."  Wear this into a police station, or a courtroom, or to your fathers
house, and practice lying.  See how you do.

Disclaimer:  I have never actually taken a lie detector test.  I learned this
from books and Psych courses.

Title:       PukeBomb
By:          Sinister X
Date:        05 - Jan - 1993



    UGH!  I think I have just seen the most tasteless job in the
world!  Its a car cleaner for the NYC Subway System.

    It was about 3:30am Saturday, and I was heading home from bar
hopping, and I am waiting in the station for my train.  Well, at this
time at night, they will take alternate trains out of service
and clean them.

    Well, here I am, waiting at this train station, when I hear some
commotion on the other track.  Well, being the sick puppy I am, I figured
"Wow, cool! Some drunk bum fell on the tracks!"  Anyway, I stumble over
to the other track and see a train parked there with a cleaning crew
running around like chickens with no head..

    I start thinking this must be really bad to have the people running
around like this, hollering and running and such.  I hear someone say
"Hey Joe! Bring the hose over here QUICK!".

    I am dying with curiousity at this point, I cannot stand it!
I walk over to the car where everyone working, and peer in.  God,
I almost hurled!!!!!

    This was my sight:

    Inside the car, (for those who have not had the chance to ride the
wonderful NYC Trains, the cars have seats that run down the lengths
of both sides of the car facing each other, like this:)


     -----------------------------------------
    (     SEATS       SEATS       SEATS       )
F   (-----------------------------------------)  B
R   (                                         )  A
O   (                                         )  C
N   (-----------------------------------------)  K
T   (     SEATS       SEATS       SEATS       )
     -----------------------------------------


    Anyway, I peer in, and see what appears to be the results of a
BarfBomb.  There was multi-colored steaming puke EVERYWHERE!! On the
seats, on the windows, on the advertisements, on the floor. EVERYWHERE!

    God, the stench of puke was permeating the air.  I almost blew
chunks myself.  From the shear volume of puke, and the different colors
of it, I believe it was a MassPeoplePuke, My theory is a group of people were
out drinking, and someone got sick, and hurled, then the others smelling
and viewing the puke, they themselves puked!

    God, the sight was sick!  There are about 5 guys in the car attempting
to clean this puke up.  One had a hose and was trying to was it away, all
the others had putty knives scraping the puke up.

    Never, I have never felt soo much pity for a guy doing his job before.
It was really putrid in that car... UGh!  Whew... it was bad!

ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

     AUDIO CD PLAYER TO CD-ROM DRIVE
     -------------------------------
     No, you cannot convert your CD audio player into a CD-ROM drive.

     But, Bill Hemmings of 1:300/11 claims:
     I should get a nickle for all the times the question has been asked
     "can I use a cheap ordinary cd-rom drive for computer data". And a
     dollar for all the wrong answers. Because, it turns out, it not
     only can be done, but it's cheap. I'm not going to go into the
     details here, because my opinion is that it's not worth the
     trouble. But for those on a REALLY short shoestring, check out the
     July/ August issue of 'Midnight Engineering'. Everything you need
     to read the digital data stream is there. You'll need a device
     driver, however, to interface to DOS. You can order the magazine

     [I read the article.  It sounds like it would take a lot of
     technical expertise to get the computer to control the CD player.
     The experiment was for playing around with digital music, not
     reading CD-ROM discs.]

     CD-ROM SUPPORT FILES
     --------------------
     I have a large collection of CD-ROM support & information files.
     You may either FREQ: HARDWARE for a list or call my BBS and
     download on your first call.  See credits below.

     DAK
     ---
     Is selling a BSR CD-ROM drive which is actually a Sony drive.  380
     ms, 8 K buffer, $399.  But is it really SCSI?  No one seems to know
     for certain!

          drive:     CDU 6201-20 external
                     CDU-531     internal
          interface: CDB-242 interface BUS -OR-
                     DTC3280A "SCSI" Controller
                     8-bit, pseudo SCSI?

     Doors/BBS Usage
     ---------------
     Most CD-ROM databases, including encyclopedias, do not permit you
     to install on a BBS for public access.

     Errors
     ------
     Experiencing disc read errors?  Try cleaning the lens with a CD
     lens cleaner available at any audio store and clean the disc.
     Disc access slow?  Try increasing MSCDEX buffers.

     Microsoft Bookshelf
     -------------------
     IME is selling them for $59.

     Microsoft CD-ROM Extension
     --------------------------
     Non-removable TSR that configures your CD-ROM drive to behave like
     a network drive/device. Supposedly, you can get the latest version
     on Compu$erve. Otherwise, it is available from your dealer but not
     Microsoft. With DOS 5.0, you must use SETVER.  Here's a brief
     summary of command line options-

     MSCDEX [/E/K/S/V] [/D:<driver> ... ] [/L:<letter>] [/M:<buffers>]
          option: /E        Use expanded memory for cache

Definitions
-----------

     CD-ROM
     ------
     Means "Compact Disc Read-Only Media".  It is exactly the same thing
     as the audio CD except for just music, it also contains data.
     Introduced in 1984.

     CD-I - Interactive
     -------------------------------
     A Sony-Philips developed consumer oriented CD based video and audio
     system combining hardware and software.  A home consumer version of
     CD-ROM, with music, pictures, and partial-screen motion video that
     plugs into a TV set and stereo.  CD-I gives a variety of high
     quality digital pictures, including still photographs, graphics,
     and animation; and it delivers four grades of sound from AM quality
     for narration to CD digital audio style high-fidelity for music.
     However, moving video is currently only possible on 40% of the
     screen.  CD-I is designed to deliver interactive entertainment
     (anything from encyclopedias to games).  CD-I offers ease of use by
     having a microprocessor built into the CD-I player, which hooks up
     to a TV set and stereo system and plays audio and video CDs as well
     as CD-I specific applications (no microcomputer is required).  The
     user interacts with the program using a pointing device such as a
     joystick or mouse.(1)

     CD-ROM XA - Extended Architecture
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     A CD that is a hybrid of CD-ROM and CD-I proposed by Philips, Sony,
     and Microsoft. This technology requires a microcomputer and gives
     CD-ROM users the ability to access some of CD-I's audio and video
     features, and CD-I users the ability to play some (but not all)
     CD-ROM XA discs.(1)

     CD-ROM WO - Write Once
     ----------------------
     Aka "Frankfurt Group Proposal"  Proposed successor to the ISO
     9660:1988 standard to support CD-WO hardware and X/Open or IEEE
     POSIX file systems.  Contact Sun Microsystems.

     Sony has marketed a re-writable CD-ROM system for in-house
     publishing.  Cost $20,000

     CDTV
     ----
     Available from Commodore.

     Magneto-optical
     ---------------

     POSIX file systems.  Contact HP or Sun Microsystems.

     WORM
     ----
     Means "Write Once Read Many".  Not CD-ROM compatible.


DRIVES
------

     Access Time: rated time it takes for the CD-ROM drive to seek to
          the requested position on the disc, usually 300-1500ms.  See
          stroke for max access time spec.

     Audio: most CD-ROM drives have stereo audio capability and simply
          require software to play a CD-Audio disc; such drives will
          usually have a headphone jack, volume control, and/or line out
          jacks; some have such jacks directly on the interface card.

     Buffer/Cache: The CD-ROM drive hardware cache is the internal
          buffer size. It ranges from 0-64K.  For software cache,
          see Microsoft Extension.

     Caddy: provide extra protection to CD-ROM disc at additional cost.
          Some people complain they rattle.  Not all drives use a caddy
          (top or drawer loading).

          compatibility- Sony/Toshiba/Amdek/Chinon/Apple type
                         Access type
                         Philips type

          rumored best price: EduCorp $5.50/10

     Data transfer rate: 150-171 Kb/sec depending on interface.

     Device driver: hardware specific software that handles low-level
          calls to CD-ROM hardware.

          Young Minds driver
          ------------------
          "Universal driver".  Allows the DRM-600 to automagically
          change cd-roms if you need to use a different disc.

     Error correction technique: CIRC, EDC/ECC

     Interface: CD-ROM drives are either proprietary serial or SCSI.

     Jukebox: Pioneer DRM-600/610 CD-ROM Changer (6-cd jukebox unit)
          only one known in existance.

     Repair: CD ROM Doctor.   He currently repairs all makes of Toshiba,
          and is now expanding into various SONY Models and Hitachi
          Models - currently 1703 and 1503S.  He generally charge s
          $100.00 for a cleaning, adjustment, and small repairs.  He
          also has a 2 week turnaround time which beats repair by
          manufacturer and he is both friendly and professional.

     Stroke: measurement of arm movement from inner to outter track, in
          CD-ROM drive case, the laser.  See access time.

     Data Discman
     ------------
     By Sony.  A hand-held "Electronic Book" that plays 8-cm optical
     discs in both CD-ROM and CD Audio format and includes built-in
     retrieval software along with a high-resolution LCD display to
     provide a completely portable, self-contained database access
     device. Capable of holding around 200 meg of information.

     The Wall Street Journal says that Sony yesterday announced November
     availability of the Data Discman in the US.  Size of a thick
     paperback book; weight about 2 pounds.  Suggested retail of $549.95
     which includes 3 starter disks: Compton's Concise Encyclopedia, the
     Wellness Encyclopedia, and the World Travel Translator.  More than
     20 disks will be available by December 25, including the Bible, a
     wine guide, and a moview review guide, all selling for between $30
     and $130.

     The US model is different from the Japanese model with a larger
     screen.  Sony says that there will eventually be different versions
     with varied prices and capabilities.

                              433. MEDICINES
The following medicines are for man, while those commencing at receipt No. 
331, and ending at No. 392 are for horses, cattle, &c., unless when stated 
to the contrary.

                              434. FOR DROPSY
Take of powdered jalap 5 gr., powdered rhubarb 5 gr., powdered scammony 5 
gr., powdered elaterium 1/2 gr., bitartrate of potash 1/2 drm., sulphate 
of potash 1/2 drm., and syrup of ginger sufficient to make into pills; mix 
and divide into five pills. These five pills given at once form an 
excellent hydragogue cathartic to clear the chest, relieve breathing and 
diminish the dropsical effusion.

                          435. ANTIBILIOUS PILLS
Take of camomel 20 grs., jalap powder 20 grs., tartar-emetic 2 grs., and 
syrup sufficient to form into pills; divide into eight pills. The dose is 
tow at bed time; repeated in the morning if necessary. This forms an

Take of rhubarb powder 1 scruple, castile soap half a drachm, calomel 12 
grs., mix and divide into pills; two or three to be taken at bed time; 
emetrics, purges, fomentations about the stomach and liver, and exercise 
will seldom fail to cure jaundice when it is a simple disease; and when 
complicated with dropsy, a scirrous liver, or other chronic complaints, it 
is hardly to be cured by any means. Castile soap has been looked upon as a 
kind of specific.

                                437. ASTHMA
Take of powdered squills 2 drms., powdered assafoetida 1 drachm, mix and

artificial skin, which cannot be washed off. It is very useful as it

day. This is a most excellent article, give it a trail.

                      491. TO REMOVE WARTS AND CORNS
This is very often done by means of nitrate of silver, or some of the 
mineral acids; but the best caustic for this purpose is that recommended 
for cancer in the skin.


                          492. CANCER IN THE SKIN
No one but an impostor will presume to cure a true cancer, containing the 
cancer cell, and situated in the muscles. Many times hard tumors, not 
containing the cancer cell, are called cancers, and are removed by 
different methods, which is very easily accomplished, without a danger of 
their returning; by which means base quacks become lauded by the 
illiterate, for their superior skill in banishing this dreadful malady, 
and the orphan, and finally, in consequence thereof, plunge themselves 
headlong over yonder precipice of eternal misery. Cancer which are 
situated in the skin, and are sometimes called spider cancers, &c., may be 
cured by the following caustic: take of sulphate of iron, 1 part; and 
acetate of lead, 1 part; pulverize each separately, as fine as possible, 
and mix well together; then, by means of a probe or knitting-needle, touch 
the cancer with it every morning for three or four times, and you will be 
able to draw it all out; after which apply adhesive straps that it may 
heal. It is used in the same way to destroy corns and warts. In the case 
of cancer, physic well before applying it.

                              493. FOR WORMS
Give a child one year old 15 drops of spirits of turpentine on sugar, 
fasting, for three mornings in succession; follow the last dose with a 
good dose of castor oil; this forms an excellent vermifuge. The dose of 
spirits of turpentine for a child two years old is 20 drops, three years 
old 25 drops, four years old 30 drops, &c.

                           494. SPASMODIC CROUP
Genuine croup is indeed of very rare occurrence, and is a fearfully 
dangerous disease, the only chances are to call in a physician at once. In 
genuine croup, the child seems to have a cold and is hoarse for a few days 
previous to the attack; but the fit generally comes on suddenly in 
spasmodic croup, which may be treated as follows. During the fit put the 
child in a warm bath, apply hot water to the throat, allow fresh air, and 
sprinkle the face and chest with cold water.

                            495. FOR FLATULENCY
Make a tea of the seeds of anise, caraway, and coriander, and drink freely 
of it.

                             496. FOR HICCOUGH

troublesome.

                            497. FOR HEARTBURN
This is a very disagreeable sensation, but may be banished by taking a 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda dissolved in half a tumbler full of 
sweetened water.

                              498. ERYSIPELAS
This when very bad needs the attendance of a physician; when not so bad, 
paint the inflamed part over with white lead, mixed with paint oil, it is 
an excellent remedy.


                              499. FOR FELON
Poultice well with flaxseed meal until matter begins to form, then at once 
have it well laid open with a lance, continue the poultice for some time 
afterwards.

                           500. HAIR RESTORATIVE
Take of black mustard seed 1/2 oz., red pepper 15 grains, blood root 1/2 
oz., cantharides 15 grains, castile soap 1/2 oz., alcohol one quart; mix 
all together in a bottle, let stand for a week, occasionally shaking. 
Perfume with oil of bergamot, and apply three or four times a day.

                 501. TO KILL RATS AND MICE WITHOUT POISON
Slice up a quantity of corks, grease, and scent them with oil of anise; 
throw them in the way of the rats and mice; they will eat, but cannot 
digest them; the result is they will die.

                              502. EYE WATER
One part of good brandy, to six of clean rain or distilled water, makes an 
admirable eye water for most cases of sore eyes.

                   503. FOR CHRONIC GOUT AND RHEUMATISM
Take of bicarbonate of potash 1/2 drachm, tincture of orange 2 drachms, 
compound decoction of aloes 8 oz., mix. Dose, a wine glass full whenever 
the fit is expected. This is Sir A. Cooper's prescription.

                      504. FOR SICKNESS AND VOMITING
Take of creosote 16 drops, acetic acid 16 drops, compound spirit of 
juniper 1 oz., syrup 1 oz., water 14 oz.; mix the creosote with the acid, 
add gradually the water, and lastly the syrup and spirit. Dose from two to 
four tablespoonsful.

                            505. LAXATIVE PILL
Take of powdered aloes 1 drachm, gamboge 10 grains, Castile soap and water 
sufficient to make a pill mass; mix and divide into 34 pills. Dose, one 
two, or three, to be given when necessary, for torpid bowels.

                             506. FOR HEADACHE
In case of a severe attack of headache the best remedy is, generally, to 
take a good strong physic of salts and senna. If this does not relieve it, 
or where the person is very frequently troubled with headache, apply a 
blister to the back of the neck, you will find it an excellent remedy.

                        507. ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS
The antidotes for poisoning with the strong mineral acids, such as nitric, 
muriatic, sulphuric, or oxalic acids are magnesia, chalk, whiting, in milk 
or water; mucilaginous or soapy liquids. When sulphuric acid has been 
taken, use very little water if any. Irritate the throat with a feather to 
produce vomiting.
The antidote for poisoning with corrosive sublimate or any other 
preparation of mercury, is albumen, as whites of eggs, in large quantity, 
flour and water, and milk. The whites of eggs are best.


The antidotes for poisoning by opium, or any of its preparations, as 
morphia, laudanum, &c., are the stomach pump if it can be had; emetic of 
tartar emetic, 2 to 5 grains, or sulphate of zinc, 15 to 30 grains, or 
sulphate of copper, 12 to 15 grs., for an adult. The sulphates of zinc or 
copper are best, because they act quicker. External excitation, keep in 
motion, mechanical excitement of respiration, cold effusion to the head 
and face, feet in hot water, electro-magnetism, internal stimulants, as 
bicarbonate of ammonia, 5 to 25 grains in water, carbonate of ammonia, 5 
to 15 grains, in water, coffee and vegetable acids. Some propose as an 
antidote for every case of poisoning, half a pint of bland oil, as sweet 
oil, fresh butter melted to oil, &c., to be drank at once, for an adult.

                        508. TREATMENT OF DROWNING
If respiration has ceased when the body is taken out of the water, it 
should instantly be commenced artificially, by putting a pipe into one 
nostril, and closing the mouth and the other nostril, and very gently 
blowing through it about 15 times in a minute; but it is a better plan to 
use a small pair of bellows, putting its muzzle into the nostril, at the 
same time the body should be wiped dry, and be assiduously rubbed with hot 
cloths; hot bricks and bottles of hot water should be put into the armpit, 
between the thighs, and to the feet; the head should be raised, the 
nostrils irritated with a feather, or the fumes of hartshorn, and a warm 
injection of turpentine, made as follows, may be thrown up - oil of 
turpentine, 3 drachms; gruel, 1/2 pint; and the yolk of 1 egg. Incorporate 
the turpentine with the egg, then add the gruel. Galvanism should be 
resorted to, if respiration is not quickly restored. As soon as the 
patient can swallow, he should have some weak wine and water; and soon 
afterwards an emetic of a large tablespoonful of mustard, mixed with 6 
ozs. of water, to clear the stomach of the water which he has swallowed, 
and to restore the circulation by the impetus of vomiting. After some 
hours he will suffer from severe headache and fever, which must be 
relieved by bleeding, purgatives, &c., which will be attended to by a 
physician, who will be present by this time. A case is related in which 
life was restored by the most persevering friction, which was kept up for 
eight hours before the humanity of the surgeon, Dr. Douglass, of Havre, 
was rewarded by a return of respiration.

                    509. GOOD SAMARITAN OR PAIN-KILLER
Take of 95 percent alcohol 2 quarts, and add to it the following articles: 
oils of sarsafras and hemlock, spirits of turpentine, balsam of fir, 
chloriform, tincture of catechu and guaiacum, of each 1 oz., oil of 
origanum 2 oz., oil of wintergreen 1/2 oz., and gum of camphor, 1/2 oz. 
Let it all be well incorporated and you have the most excellent pain 
killer that was ever made. It is good for rheumatism, headache, neuralgia, 
cuts, sprains, burns, bruises, spinal affections, ear-ache, tooth-ache, 
sore throat, &c. This is used internally and externally, the dose 
internally is 10 drops; take on sugar.

Little 8 year old Mary came in the kitchen one afternoon and said, "Hey
Mom, can I get pregnant?"  "Of course not," was her mother's reply.
"Are you absolutely sure," asked Mary.  "Certainly," said her Mother.
Mary ran back out the door and said, "OK guys, same game."

A woman went to the doctor and told him that most of the pizazz had gone
out of their lovemaking and her husband didn't pay much attention to her
anymore.  The doctor told her that a lot of it was mental preparation
and recommended the following:  Greet him after work with a martini and
a lustful kiss, than a candlelight dinner of his favorite meal.  He also
gave her a powder to place in his after dinner coffee.  She was to
report to him the next morning, as to the results.
"I followed your instructions to the letter," she told the doctor, "and
I am very satisfied." " When he came in from work, I met him with a
pitcher of martini's and gave him a very horny kiss.  We had his
favorite meal and I slipped the powder into his coffee.  He drank it,
looked at me, took hold of the tablecloth and snatched it off the table.
China, crystal, and silverware, went flying in all directions.  He then
ripped my clothes off, threw me on the table and ate me, then he screwed
me, like he used to do when we were in college."  The doctor said, " I
am sure glad that it worked out so great, but I am sorry that so much of
the china and crystal got broken."  "Oh that is alright," she replied,
"we didn't like that restaurant very much anyway!"

Little Johnny and his Dad were walking in the park one afternoon and saw
two dogs screwing.  "Daddy, what are they doing," Johnny asked?  "Why
they are making puppies," his Dad said.  That night Johnny caught his
mother in the classic missionary position and his dad pounding away.
"What are you doing, Dad,"  Johnny asked?  "We are making babies," his
Dad told him.  "Turn her over Dad," said Johnny, "I'd rather have a
puppy."

A man decided that he had had enough of the city rat race so he bought a
piece of property about 3 days from anywhere and built him a cabin.  He
had been there about 6 months and heard a knock on the door.  He opened
it and there stood 'Grizzly Adams.'  "Howdy neighbor" says Grizzly.  The
man replies, "I don't have any neighbors."  Grizzly sez, "I meant that I
live 4 canyons east of here and thought that I would come by to meet you
and ask you to a party, Sat nite."  The man thought for a minute and
decided that a party would be nice after being alone for 6 months.  He
told Grizzly that he would be glad to come.  Grizzly said, "Now there
will be some drinking at this party, will that bother you?"  "Hell no,"
said the man, "I haven't had a drop in a long time."  "There will also
be some fighting, will that bother you," asked Grizzly.  The man said,
"No, I have rather missed having a bit of excitement."  Grizzly sez,
"And one more thing, there will be some sex.., is that a problem?"  The
guy says, "After so long without, that would be nice."  "Who all is
going to be at this party," the man asked?

Grizzly grins and replies, "Well there's me and there's you!

An old couple went to the doctor for the man's annual check up.  Doc
says to the man, "I need a urine sample, stool sample, and semen
sample."  The old man, being hard of hearing, looked at his wife and
said, "what did he say?"  She replied, "he said that he needs to see a
pair of your underwear."

A janitor was sweeping the hall one day and as he passed where the
Priest was having confession, the Priest ran out and asked him to sit in
for him a few minutes while he went to the restroom.  The janitor asked,
"what do I do?"  The Priest told him that there was a list on the wall.
Just listen to what they say and tell them what it says on the list.
The first man came in and confessed to committing adultery.  The janitor
checked the list and told him to go say three 'Hail Mary's'.  Everything
was going fine until a lady came in and told him that she had taken it
anally, the nite before.  He checked his list and didn't find Anal Sex
listed, anywhere.  He stuck his head out the door and saw two choir boys
walking toward him.  "What does the Father give for anal sex, he asked
them?"  "Two snickers and a soda," was the reply.

I just heard this one . . .

A polak<sp?> is sitting at a bar when this guy comes up to him and says,
"Hey, do you know what has four arms, four legs, two heads, and sucks
dick?"
Dumbfounded, the polak replies, "No, I can't say that I do."
The guy replies, "You and your brother!  HA-HA!"  Then walks away.
The polak liked this joke, so he decided to tell it to someone else.  He
walks over to this stranger and asks, "Do you know what has four arms,
four legs, two heads, and sucks dick?"
With a confused look, the guy replies, "No, what?"
A smile on his face, the polak says, "Me and my brother!"

A farmer heard a knock on the door one day.  Answering it, he saw a
stranger.

"Look, I hope you don't mind me bothering you," spoke the stranger, "but
I was just passing by and noticed you have some milk-weeds in you field,
and I was wondering if you would mind me getting some milk?"

The farmer looked at the man as if he were crazy, "Boy, ya aint getin'
no milk out a' them there milk weeds!  It's down right imposs'ble!"

"Well, do you mind if I try anyway?"  The man inquired.

"Go right 'head boy," retorted the farmer while shaking his head.

After a while the farmer heard another knock at his door.  Answering it
he found the same man, with two gallons of milk.  Expecting it was one
big prank on him, he eyed the man suspiciously.

"Hi again," the man spoke, "On my way back I passed some honey-suckles,
and I was wondering if you would mind me getting some honey?"

The farmer spat, "Damnit boy, aint no way ta get honey from no
honey-suckles!"

"Well, do you mind if I try?"

"Go 'head," the farmer said, shaking his head again.

A while later, he heard another knock on his door.  Answering it he
found the stanger standing there with two jars full of honey.

"Hi again," the stranger smiled, "On my way back, I noticed some
pussy-willows over . . ."

"Hold on son, I'm gettin' my boots!!"

           The Night After Christmas

`Twas the night after Christmas, and boy, what a house!
 I felt like hell, and so did the spouse.
 The eggnog and turkey and candy were swell,
 but ten hours later, I sure didn't feel well.

 The stockings weren't hung by the chimney with care,
 the darned things were sprawled on the back of a chair.
 The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
 but I had a large pack of ice on my head!

 And when I finally dozed off in a nap,
 the ice woke me up when it fell on my lap.
 Then for some unknown reason, I wanted a drink,
 so I started feeling my way to the sink.
 I got along fine, till I stepped on the cat,
 I don't recall what happened after that.
 When I came to, the house was flooded with light,
 although under a table, I was high as a kite!

 While visions of sugar plums danced in my head,
 I somehow got up and back into bed.
 Then what to my wandering eyes should appear...
 but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer!
 Then the sleigh seemed to change into a red fire truck,
 and each reindeer turned into a bleary eyed buck.
 I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
 I tried to call out, but my tongue was too thick.

 Then the old devil whistled and shouted with glee,
 while the bucks pawed the earth as they grinned at me!
 Then he called them by names, and the names made me shudder.
 When I heard them, I felt like a ship minus a rudder!
 "Now Eggnog! Bacardi! Now Bourbon and Brandy!"
 "Now Fruitcake! Cold turkey! Gin Rickey and Candy!"
 To the top of his head, to the top of his skull,
 now whack away, crack away, with thumps that are dull!

 And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof,
 the prancing and pawing of each cloven hoof.
 How long this went on, I'm sure I can't say,
 though it seemed like eternity, plus one more day!
 But finally, the night after Christmas had passed,
 and I found I could really think at last!
 So I thought of the New Year a few days away,
 and I've made me a vow that no temper can sway.

 I'm sticking to water - don't even want ice!
 But there's nothing as tasty or nothing as nice.
 The night after New Year's may bother some guys,
 but I've learned my lesson, and now I am wise.
 You can have your rich victuals and liquor that's red,
 but what goes to my stomach won't go to my head.
 So a big Happy New Year to you and to all,
 I'm back on the wagon, and hope I don't fall!

    Oh, for any Trekkies that may be around (and haven't seen this yet),
here's some Christmas songs for ya...

From Jean-Luc Picard (to the tune of "Let it Snow")

Oh, the vacuum outside is endless,
unforgiving, cold and friendless,
but since we must boldly go...
Make it so, make it so, make it so...

From Wil Riker (to the tune of "Deck The Halls")

Here's a vexing Christmas riddle, fa la la la la, la la la la
Why must I play second fiddle?  Fa la la la la, la la la la
How can I impress Deanna?  Fa la la, la la la, la la la
When I'm number 2 banana?  Fa la la la la, la la, la la.

From good ol' Weasly Crusher (to the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen")

I'm at Starfleet Academy and I'd just like to say...
I miss the opportunity to weekly save the day---
To make things worse I have to be in some dumb Christmas play!
Yes I'm bright, though I'm just a teenaged boy, teenaged boy,
and the Enterprise was my most favourite toy.

And from Data...

Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh---
Or so I am reliably informed... lacking a subjective and intuatively perceived
referent for the term 'fun', I am able only to report the phenomenon as
experienced by others, whose individual perceptions somewhat colour the--
Yes, sir.

There once was a man named McSweeney
Who spilled some gin on his weeney
And just to be couth
he added Vermouth
And slipped his girl a martini!

There was a young man from Vanarden
Being blown by his wife in the garden
He said, "My dear Flo,
Where does all that stuff go?"
And she said <gulp>,"I beg your pardon?"

Rules of Bedroom Golf:

1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play. Normally one club and
two balls.

2. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.

3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the
balls out of the hole.

4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners
are permitted to check the shaft stiffness before play begins.

5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to
the hole.

6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the
course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so may
result in being denied permission to play the course again.

7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon
arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to
admire the entire course, with special attention to the well-formed bunkers.

8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are
currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have
been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.

9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.

10. Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly
scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.
Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else
playing on what they consider to be a private course.

11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some
players may be embarassed if they find the course to be temporarily under
repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More
advanced players will find alternate means of play with this is the case.

12. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before
attempting to play the back nine.

13. Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to proceed at
a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.

14. It is considered outstanding performace, time permitting, to play the same
hole several times in one match.

The Muppets Frog went to a bank to finance his next show.  Linus
Paddiwack asked him if he had collaterial.  Frog paused ...
Then he took out a ceramic model of Miss Piggie.

The loan officer, not entirely familiar with lending money to
ficticiuos characters excuses himself and returns with the branch
vice president (WHY?? do banks have more vice presidents than
workers?).

Anyway, the V.P. looks at the ceramic model and said,
"Well, that's a knick-knack, Paddiwack.  Give the frog a loan."

Here's one for you all:

There once was a priest who was out on a chartered fishing yacht one
day.

When he had a huge strike, everyone gathered around to see him reel in
one of the biggest fish ever caught in those waters.

When he had it safely landed, the captain exclaimed, "Wow, would you
look at that son-of-a-bitch-fish?!?"  Whereupon the kindly prelate
complained.

The captain told him, however, that this was the proper term for that
particular fish.

Sure enough, when they got to shore, the dock hands all gaped at the
enormous catch, saying, "Will you look at that son-of-a-bitch-fish?!?"
By now, the father was convinced that they weren't all pulling his leg.

When he got home to the rectory, he proudly showed his prize to the
Mother Superior, exclaiming, "Look at this beautiful son-of-a-bitch!"

The nun raised her eyebrows at the priest's un-expected language, and
was quickly re-assured that it was the proper terminology for this fish.

Later that evening, the priest and the nun were entertaining a new,
young priest in their parish and served him a beautiful fish dinner.

He was quite surprised to hear the both of them often remarking about
the wonderful "son-of-a-bitch-fish".

At the end of the meal, when they asked him how he thought he might fit
in with the parish, he replied, "Shit, I think I'm gonna' get along with
all of you mother-fuckers real well!!!"
