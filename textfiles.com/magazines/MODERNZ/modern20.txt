    =======

    An analog signal (at a fixed amplitude and frequency) combined with    
    an information signal in a modulation process producing a signal for   
    transmission. A carrier provides sufficient power so that a signal     
    can be reliably detected at some other point or points. Modulation     
    makes a more powerful signal. The term carrier may refer to this       
    powerful signal either before or (more commonly) after modulation.     
    Also called carrier wave or carrier frequency.

    undesirable collisions that could mix data when several stations try   
    to transmit simultaneously.
