  Note that however this information is used is not the responcibility

of the author.  However, these TGN (trunk line numbers) are used by

the operators of the phone companies, and the service companies alike.

Used mainly by the repair companies in reporting how a line comes in,

it can be used by the intelligent as a means to social engineer various

things from the phone company.  Note that every area does have a TGN, but

various locations are covered by another trunk lines.  This is just a 

sampling of the multitude that is found within New Jersey at the time.

Special business may have a different TGN.  Also these TGN are based

mainly from New Jersey Bell Phones.  The other minor telephone companies

will have different TGN for the same areas.  Plus the Long Distance 

companies have their own TGN, which I haven't quite figured out what it

is based on (I believe it is based on the area of the state, because there

are only a few for each LD company within NJ.)
