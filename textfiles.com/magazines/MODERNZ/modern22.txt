    to receive.

    Data Terminal Equipment. A piece of equipment that pro- vides an       
    entry or exit point for user data in a communication network. For      
    example, a terminal operating with the defined protocol for the        
    network is a DTE.

    Dedicated Terminal Interface. Terminal interface (TIF) software        
    residing in a slot (within a node in a shared network) that is         
    reserved for the use of a specific customer.

    Data Terminal Ready. A handshaking (flow control) signal used to       
    signal the modem (data set) that the DTE is connected, powered up,     
    and ready to receive.

    Dual Compact XL                                                            
    ===============

    An intermediate-sized node in the Engine family of communications      
    processors. The Dual Compact XL is the same physical size as the       
    Compact XL; however, it uses a dual chassis backplane containing       
    two CPU IIIs, two MAC IIIs, and two SIO II boards, while supporting    
    two additional DMA I/O slots. See Compact XL.

    ================

    Two Mini-Engine systems in an Engine-size cabinet. See Mini-Engine.

    dumb terminal                                                              
    =============

    DTE without data processing capabilities, such as teletypes, visual    
    display units, and printers. Contrast with intelligent terminal.       


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    dummy record                                                               
    ============

    A special frame used to maintain a minimum level of traffic on a       
    line when there is no valid data available. The dummy record does      
    not contain data and is automatically transmitted on a line every      
    half-second. Dummy records are transmitted over a multiple-line        
    link when all traffic is on other lines of the link.                   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    dump                                                                       
    ====

    A procedure for transferring data from a target's memory to an         
    auxiliary storage device such as a disk. Used when debugging code.

    Dynamic Debugging Tool (DDT)                                               
    ============================

    A program that permits the user to log into the Kernel and load or     
    examine the contents of a slot, change contents of memory locations,   
    or perform various special diagnostic operations.  DDT allows a user   
    access to individual slots within an ISIS node.                        


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)                                        
    ===================================

    Random Access Memory that requires refresh to keep data.
