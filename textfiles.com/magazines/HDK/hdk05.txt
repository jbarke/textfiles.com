 %Introduction:

    hAY, y0u!!!#$!  Welcome to the 5th in the HDK series of text files.  You
 might already be wondering "Ay!! WaT AppENEd 2 D ElyTE k-RaDNeSS WrIttIN???".
 Well, after a small vote was polled, we decided that the HDK texts would be
 written normally from now on.  "fUK DaT LamUR!!!@!" you say?  Well, don't
 worry, there will be many passages where you can practice your cryptography
 skills by trying to decypher the flipper writting (Flipper v1.50 now
 available).  Anyways, it's now 1993, in case you haven't noticed, so HDK
 welcomes in the new year with this incredible masterpiece of electronic
 destruction and mayhem.  Yes, in this issue, there will be so much crap
 tossed around, you will be buried up to your chin in shit.  Also, along with
 the writting, the format has changed.  HDK will no longer be a senseless
 magazine dedicated to exposing the idiots of 514.  HDK will now sympathise
 with these poor souls devoid of any intelligence, and will try to help them
 evolve into normal human beings.  N0T!  Kill'em all.  So grab on, it's going
 to fly.

 NOTE:  This issue was ready a few weeks ago, so some of the stuff might be a
 tad out of date.  I put off releasing it, mostly because I had my hands full
 with a fucking narc.  We'll be putting out a special issue on this narc in a
 few weeks.


       n0 Rati0 2 lD Y00zERz!!! We NeeD da y0oZuRZ!!! HeLP, Wee SuX!$%!


 %Various:

    This is just a collection of captures that I have picked up over the last
 month or so.  The captures are unedited, and preceeded and followed by --.
 My colourful commentary (as always) will follow each capture.

 Ok, this first one was sent to me as a new user feedback on my board.  It's
 from a guy called Black Ice:

 --
 So you're this budd i'm hearing a lot about... yeah nudd, i say your
 fourth issue when you completely destroyed the idiots at H(i)TS (Yes i!).
 Nice work! I also loved your true story about a 514 dick that had his
 neeto life! Well, now i'm working on my own mag, what you be good is to
 have another group in it. I have SHARP (Skin Heads Against Racial
 Prejudism) in my NED magazine and what would be cool would be to have HDK
 in it too. The mag would be a success and your HDK would grow even
 faster. I called here 'cause i heard HDK was the only magazine in 514
 worth reading. Now i hope your mag will combine itself in ours. Yeah,
 we'll also put some (neeto) music in the mag to make it sound better.
 Anyway ciao budd!
 --

 Wonder if he'll let the cum dry on his lips after this one is over.
 w0w!  Wasen't that pretty?  Ok let's analyse this one.  First off, anybody
 who got his name from the sticker on a snow board can't be all that serious.
 It's like me calling myself t0NkA because my cousin has that plastered on
 his toy truck.  Now, we can already see that this magazine NED will be the
 most 3lyTe thing to hit 514 since TSRNet, but I have to turn the offer down
 anyways.  My doctor warned me it would be hazardous to my mental health to be
 associated with such gh0d-like people as SHARP.  Now, although I believe
 modeming to be fun and all, I especially appreciated the fact that with a
 modem, it didn't matter how old you were (physically.  We can always spot the
 12 year old lamer requesting more WArEZ), what race you were, what religion,
 sex...  This is why, this idea of Skin Heads using computers really ticks me
 off.  Fine, go shave your head and do your "OI" shit, but leave me out of it.
 All this racist, anti-racist crap has no place in a modeming "community", and
 only serves to bother others.  Now, one more thing.  I like this guy trying
 to tell me that HDK would grow faster if it was part of NED (Not Enough
 Dick?).  Especially if they put some "neeto" music in the mag.  Yes, that's
 all we need.  A 150k text file, zipped up with some 950k music file that
 sounds something like VANNiLLA iCE (hey, he's ELiTE too you know) on steroids.
 That way only the real top notch 16.8k file hoarding warEZw0LveZ can pick the
 file up.  Real good for what HDK is supposed to mean.  So let me send this
 out to all you other sn0W B0ArD k-RaD, [ZiTS] MemberZ, and t0NKa worshippers:
 HDK will never associate with anyone who comes to me with such a joke of a
 message, and anyone who uses "budd" and "ciao" in their vocabulary.  Also the
 fact that the guy doesn't know the difference between the verb "saying" and
 "seeing" (line 1) reveals a less than 4th grade education.  So, anyways, I
 deleted him.  What do I see a few weeks later?  You got it.

 --
 The man behind HDK, finally i have come up on your board. Even though i
 consider your magazine the only GOOD digest in 514, i wont suck up
 because i need validation. Well, i never write a lot about myself in
 these types of messages so you won't hear about what i am personally, all
 i know is that i detest people who consider 2400 bauders losers like The
 Vanisher and some other dick K-Rads. Anyways, i'll let you go right now!
 --

 He'll let me go?  And the reason he never writes about himslef, is because,
 simply, there is nothing to say.
 "Hi!!! mE nAmE iZ BlAK iCe, anD I Am A GuY!!! I'LL LeT y0u Go RiGhT NoW!!!"
 Sounds a lot like the first message, without the sucking up.  Anyways, he
 doesn't know anything on h/p subjects, so I have no choice but to delete him.

 Hehe... nice paragraph man... no well i bought my PS/1 when i knew
 absolutely nothing about computers... i bought it somewhat like two years
 ago... of course i have the cash for a 486 now, but i'm still looking for a
 good 486 with the best quality of everything, Non-Interlaced XGA Color Screen
 by AAMAZING, a PS/2 keyboard 'cause they're the best quality you can get, 330
 meg HD 'cause i need to install more utilities, 14.4K USRobotics Modem, they
 also have a history of incredible marketing... well, i expect to get to pay
 something like 3000 or more dollars 'cause i also gotta buy the Pro Audio
 Spectrum which is, in fact, compatible with SB but it's somewhat like 16
 times faster and more efficient..  well ciao!

 Sorry about your dad man... well, it's because i'm getting some cash from my
 pop now 'cause my brother got an electirc Base Guitar, hundreds of types of
 clothes, three pairs of DOCS (but of course i don't share the same style as
 my brother), and some other stuff... my father understands that i need a new
 and good computer because he understands that my current one is
 non-expandable, if it would be expandable, i'd have a 486DX-50 motherboard,
 14.4K internal mode, XGA Screen, and 2.88 drive.... and probably a backup
 drive...

 You know, when I wrote that file in HDK#04, about the typical "514 elite", I
 never actually thought that anyone would believe me.  Well, there it is.  The
 above two messages prove that I am right.  I won't even comment on the above,
 except to say that most people don't go around bragging that they suck their
 father's penis so they can buy the latest in home entertainment.  That's
 right, because these fools still don't understand that the computer is a
 tool.  They still look at a 486 as a powered up nintendo (as someone said,
 but I can't recall the name).  What these people need is an ATARI 2600 and a
 pair of vibrating joysticks so he can sit on one while playing Donkey Kong.
 But what do you expect from a guy who got his alias from a Mr. Freeze
 Popsicle?  Also, know what the funniest part of this is?  Black Ice is just
 the new handle of Frosty The Iceman.  Figures.

 Why don't start a Courier Group, as "[F]ast [E]lite [C]ourier = FEC" ?? :)
 Hmm, nyway, only an idea!

 Macho ConCepTor [UMA]
 --

 Ya!!!!  Let's do that.  I can see it already: "jOIn FEC$!@$! Da FuTURE In
 WaREZ DiSTWiBUtIOn@!@!!@! GiVE uS No-RAtIO And WEE GEt ALL YouR WAreZ OUt To
 Da LokAL BAOrdZ@!@@! FEC!!! DAmn ELeeT G~!!@##~!!!".  And while we're on the
 subject of starting new groups that do absolutely nothing, what's this UMA
 thing?  Underarm Masturbation Action?  Unclean Moose Anus?  And I can't
 believe, that still, after all the insults I have thrown around, Macho Man
 still writes his alias "ConCepTor".  Here, try this, it's even more k-rad:
 k0NCePtUr.  That goes well with FEC.  Hmmm, hold on.  FeC.  Yes, that's it,
 much better.  MaCH0 k0NCePtUr [uMa/FeC] ElYTe DAmN It!!!.  Actually, in the
 past month, these are some of the groups that MaCH0 k0NCePtUr has
 joined/dropped: UMA/BoA/CoMA and a few others I can't recall.  One month,
 three groups.  Quite a ratio.

 Want to see worse than Macho ConCepTor?  No problem.  Remember The
 Confederate, co-sysop of that incredibly ugly board South Of The Border
 (sysop was El Presidente)?  Well, he's still around, and this is his eleet
 signature.

 DAt!!!  Some people never learn do they?

 Also, while we're on this group thing, anyone remember the elite group [HiTS]
 (or [TiTS], [ZiTS], [RiTZ]... whatever) mentionned in HDK#04?  Well, remember
 how one of the main members (or victims) was XRay?  Well he's back at it.

 --
 ˛ XRay / [AdT] ˛
 --

 Ahhh, but that's not enough.  Seems XRay enjoys having long titles that mean
 absolutely nothing.

 --
 ˛ XRay ˛ Head of Research Division, [AdT]
 --

 Well, seems that since [ZiTS] was such a pile of hype and crap, XRay finally
 realised this and quit.  Problem is he only got the lesson half right.  Even
 though leaving [TiTS] was the most intelligent thing he ever did, XRay lost
 what little bit of dignity he had by going right back out and forming this
 other group [AdT] (alarm systems for the elite).  Although he chose a name
 with no lower cased 'i', he still managed to insert a lower case letter
 somewhere in the acronym.  So this is where I speak out once more.  It seems
 a tradition (or perhaps a curse) of 514 that everyone must start a group
 before they actually accomplish anything.  Problem is that, even if the
 group promises it will be the best in it's field and won't die away, the
 group usually doesn't accomplish shit, and fades away one month later.  And I
 really don't see the necessity of having a group anyways.  Let's take two
 examples.  First, me.  I am in no group, and up to know have released more
 files than a group like [ZiTS] or [AdT] will release in it's lifetime.  I'm
 not gloating, but apart from HDK I have released a few files that I am proud
 of and constitute an achievement.  Now, another example is the group NuKE.
 This is a group, but unlike [ZiTS], NuKE has proven itself to be a serious
 group, not some excuse to add letters to an acronym.  NuKE has been talked
 about in magazines, newspapers, on networks.  They have their own net, and
 have released (up to now) four infojournals, and other files.  Who else in
 514 can say the same?  Oh, sure [ZiTS] will say: "HaY!!~@! FuK Y0u@#@!# We R
 ElEeT, And WeE WiLL RElEAZEZ LoT'S o' DEmOZ!$@!# WEe RElEAzED A CWaCK F0R
 STaRc0N ][@@!$@! We'Re K-RAd!!! I WaNT U 2 Ap0l0GiZe RiTe N0W!!!!!".  But
 it's all talk, no action, as usual, just like the good old era of Dallas
 Barr.


        You have no life and your parents hate you.  What's the deal?


 %Incredible r0dent alert:

    Remember Black Ice (aka Frosty The Iceman)?  Hope so it was only a few
 lines ago.  Well, it seems that he did not take too well to being deleted off
 TPR twice in a row.  So he decided to get even.  What did he do?  Rag on me,
 cut my lines, change my credit history?  No, nothing so mild.  He went
 overboard.  In some countries, he would be shot on site, hung with barbed
 wire, thrown in a cage with lions, a moat with crocodiles, impaled on a
 wooden stake, cast into a fiery pit, married to SgT. RAttLEbReAD...  What he
 did was so inhumane, even the most sadistic torturer would have sympathy.  He
 made believe I was his accomplice, his friend.  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!  People have
 killed themselves for less.  I'll proceed to show you people what I am
 talking about.  First of all, you must realise that I have never posted a
 message to the guy, or ever talked to him voice.  The only time was to insult
 him when his alias was The Dark Lord, a long while ago, and I had no idea
 this was the same guy as Black Ice.  The following is a newuser feedback left
 on The Last Trial a few days ago.

 Whoa. Ok i got the number from Mechanix, he said this would be a good
 enough board. Well, what groups do you keep here, surely hope it's not a
 local group. Ok. even though Mechanix had wanted me to help him continue
 his Hippie Dippie Klub, i've chosen to use my own road and make my own
 magazine. The second issue is coming at the end of this month. Well, i
 hope you don't have dickhead idiots with long 50 line signatures on the
 board 'cause i personally detest those losers.
 --

 This is not the only instance.  He also threatened some people, saying he
 could have them "put" into HDK, and that he had my full support.  This is
 obviously another lie, since I don't even know him.  Basically what we have
 here is your average little lonely kid, that has a severe case of insanity.
 Either he dreams stuff at night, and thinks he actually lived through them,
 or he has such an inferiority complex, that he needs to live through someone
 else to get a life of his own.  Sadly, this someone else was me.  So, to all
 sysops out there, if you ever get a guy like Black Ice leaving me as a
 reference, get rid of him.  I sincerely hope you are reading this Black Ice.
 If not, I'll find your number and read it to you voice.

 Not the type to leave an issue while it's still hot, I was given the
 following, regarding Black Ice.  The following capture is a newuser infoform
 that Black Ice filled out when he applied on a 514 board.  The infoform is
 geared towards hacking/phreaking/anarchy, things that Black Ice knows nothing
 about, but tries to make people believe otherwise.  He tries to rag on
 boards, comparing them to "real" h/p boards.  Problem is, Black Ice wouldn't
 know a "real" h/p board if it got rammed down his throat, and out his anus.
 He has never been on a "real" h/p board in his life, and tries to make us
 believe otherwise by repeating information he has seen floating around.

 Notice in the "Subj:" field of the message header: "CONTEST!!!!!!!!!".  How

 some people didn't get the point yet, so why not put 45 of them, all in
 different blinking ansi colors.  Anyways, I took on the task of getting this

 There.  Maybe now the board will get some decent users.  After all, just an
 ascii from AsKEE D00dEZ posted on a network attracts hundreds of good users.
 So if anyone from MBS wants to post this on the system, I'd be gratefull.
 I'd give them my latest ware.  Championship Karate!  CGA, 180k.  AweSum

 %Other bbs lameness:

    When I roam through the "BBS ADD" section of a message system or network,
 the one thing that pisses me off the most, the one thing that makes me want
 to shoot something is when I see "9600+ only" on a board advertisement.  Then
 when they put "H/P support, 9600+ only" I feel like doing a cn/a on the
 number and cutting the guy's wires with a pair of motorised hedge clippers.
 In any case, one day I called up this 514 board, and what do I see?  Well,
 here it is.  Comments are in <* *>.

 <* Ok, look at the shitload of mistakes here.  "Board" capitalised,    *>
 <* "support" without an "s" at the end, and of course, the traditional *>
 <* "I'm elite, you suck" "!".                                          *>

 Get yourself a real fuckin' modem!!!

 <* This guy is so elite he thinks that he can dictate to me what makes  *>
 <* a real modem.  And of course he put's "!!!" since he's real elite by *>
 <* now.  As for modems, I'd buy a 1200 AppleCat for scanning and tone   *>
 <* producing before I'd get an HST.  Can an HST produce 2600Hz tones?   *>

 (or get lost!)

 What a fucking lame display of elitness and d00dness if I've ever seen one.
 It doesn't even have a lock-out password, it just hangs you up.  I wonder
 what all those guys going through 2400 (and even 1200) outdials must think.
 In any case, I didn't tell you the number was 948-2131.  Oops, that slipped
 out.  Problem is, along with my "not real fuckin' modem" I have a "not real
 fuckin' keyboard" and I can't backspace to fix the mistake.  Guess I'll have
 to leave in the number.
 Ok, now maybe I could understand the above from a board that only had wAReZ,
 and no message section, but when I see the following, I go haywire.

 Now this is completely ridiculous.  This idiot thinks all pHreAkErZ use K0dEz
 and PBXes to call LD boards (as if any self respecting h/p user would call
 this anyways).  What Vanisher (aka El Presidente) can't get into his cat
 litter brain, is that what happens to all those calling through a network
 outdial, or using cu off a unix, or kermit off any other system?  All these
 are usually limited to 2400, maybe even 1200 sometimes.  Then there are those
 of us who have better things to do than waste our money on S00pEr FaSt El8
 M0dUmbZ to play with.  And what's this wares and h/p mix?  Truly lame.  All
 you'll get are h/p sections with wAreZ PuPpiEz screaming "HaY@!!! I nEeD Sum
 K0DeZ CuZ M0mmY Don'T pAy Me F0nE BilLZ No M0rE!!@!@ HeLP1!!#!!".  But thank
 God that Vanisher is around.  Who else would of invented 0 day H/P (quoted
 from SP, thanx, truely funny).  That's right.  It's amazing.  Here's my new

 %Interview:

    I got a lot of feedback on the chat captures I included in HDK#03.  I
 guess the funny part is how we revealed that people will often lie their
 brains out just to try and have "strangers" believe they're the center of
 the 514 area code.  How often have we seen it.  A local nobody acting as if
 he knew it all on some unknown pirate board, but when he confronts someone
 who can see through the shit, he cowers down and dissapears.  Well, I dug up
 another one, and will try to get at least one for each of the following
 issues.  I was reading the various bbs adds on a network, when I came across
 one like this:

 --
 Virtual Underground BBS
 (514)963-9204
 h/p files only
 --

 Finding this interresting, I call up the board.  First of all, it's run off
 as a second system to a bbs called No Name BBS.  This second system, Virtual
 Underground, is advertised as H/P ONLY at the logon.  So I apply.  First
 thing that ticks me off is that the newuser questionnaire is actually (word
 for word) a shortened version of the one I wrote for my board, although only
 the easy questions are left in, and a few "WaReZ PiRaTE B0ArdZ QuEStIonZ"
 added in like "Define PBX".  As if anyone and his elite grandmother still
 doesn't know what a PBX is.  It was only the topic of conversation on the "oh
 so much information" TSRNet for over a month.
 HaY D00Dz!!!@!@ I jUsT FiNd A PbX!@!!!! KaN SuM 1 KraCk iT 4 Me?!?!? PleEz!!
 Anyways, I got in and finally got to chat with the sysop when he called back
 on my system to check me out.  Also, the guy's name is Dr. Stone, although
 he'll probably change it after this.  Once again, comments are in <* *>.

 Mechanix> You're the sysop of Virtual Underground right?

 dR.St0nE> ya

 Mechanix> Sorry, didn't see the alias, what is it?

 Mechanix> Yes

 dR.St0nE> ....for modele (do you speak french?!?!)

 <* Doesn't punctuation come AFTER a phrase.  ?Why.  See, makes no sense. *>
 <* And what's wrong with "?"?  What's this "?!?!" shit?                  *>

 Mechanix> No. Well, you could of aksed, I don't like people using my stuff
 Mechanix> without asking.

 <* Actually I do speak french, but this was funnier.  I'm evil <g>. *>

 dR.St0nE> ya...

 Mechanix> Do you know anything about h/p?

 dR.St0nE> ... i begin.... (2-3 month only..)

 <* There's that damn "..." at the beginning again. *>

 Mechanix> You're a beginner, and you open a h/p only bbs? Don't you think
 Mechanix> that is stupid?

 dR.St0nE> no.... tk...i am beginner in h/p....but... the modem....i call
 dR.St0nE> h/p before..

 <* Man, I'll let you figure that one out yourselves. *>

 Mechanix> Ok, well is your board any good? I don't want to call for nothing.

 dR.St0nE> ... it's a new board.... but....

 Mechanix> Ok, last thing. You've been into h/p for 2-3 months?

 dR.St0nE> ...yes....ok...yes if you think..

 <* I'm asking him, and he answers "if you think".  Obviously, of the two *>
 <* of us, I am the only one thinking.  Think he works on instincts.      *>

 Mechanix> Ok, so you do know a little bit on hacking/phreaking?

 dR.St0nE> ... bof... more.... i have had many experience with underground
 dR.St0nE> board and user

 <* Ahhhh, a veteran. *>

 Mechanix> Oh, ok, well I'll tell you what. I'll ask you some questions, and
 Mechanix> you can forget about this questionnaire, which is much harder, ok?

 <* He was in the middle of the newuser ?-nnaire, and all I had seen were *>
 <* carriage returns being struck in despair.                             *>

 dR.St0nE> ok?! ...ya

 <* ...Good?! *>

 Mechanix> First, what "underground board" did you call?

 Mechanix> Ok, next. What "underground (h/p) users" would know you?

 <* Thought I'd specify "h/p" so I don't end up with a [ZiTS] member list. *>

 %Flashback:

    Last issue, we had a flashback on Dallas Barr, and the rest of the 514
 h/p "we have a PBX" elites of TSRNet during the summer of 1991.  In this
 issue, we bring you something just as lame, the self-proclaimed hacking group
 (C)uT, which wasen't much more than a name change for the group HiT, a spin
 off of FiS.  Well, just the fact that FiS is involved, we automatically must
 assume that this will be incredibly dumb, lame and downright embarassing for
 any of the ex-members that will read this.  Right you are!  As a general
 rule, anything that comes from the childish, egomaniac mind of Dallas Barr
 will end up in utter failiure.  I have yet to hear more from FoG in 403, his
 newest attempt to become the eleet d00de to control that portion of the
 world.  However, I will work on getting an interview with Mr. Barr for one of
 the upcoming issues.  Anyways, back to (C)uT.  Well, I have included, and
 commented (yAy!! ElE3T!!!), the 3 newsletters that (C)uT had released in it's
 pittyful existence.  Comments are in <* *>.  These files were written between
 the end of the 1991 summer, and the middle of 1992.

Published Monthly By (C)uT                                           Issue # 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Comments From The Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well it seems that the hacking world has come to a halt, and it's supporting
groups disappearing from existence. However just as old groups depart new ones
replace them. (C)uT is one of the newer groups to join the corrupt underground
of computer hacking. No doubt though (C)uT will be around for a while.
Dedicated to the hacking world,(C)uT will possibly become a worldwide hacking
and phreaking group. As well as the stand still of the hacking world so is it's
supplies. It seems that it is becoming more and more difficult to find hacking
information and material. Either the hacking methods are no longer effective
or the programming has already been covered. This is not surprising considering
that there is not an endless supply of hacking information and material. 
Despite these rough times we at (C)uT will try to keep the hacking world up to
date with all the latest information and material as it is available.

 <* Ok, first off, what's a "worldwide hacking and phreaking group"?  Some *>
 <* 13 year old's fantasy?  The truth is it's not possible.  Even groups   *>
 <* like the LOD/H or CCC were never worldwide.  As for the supply of      *>
 <* hacking material being hard to find, this kid obviously had no idea of *>
 <* ftp on internet, or textfile boards.  Guess when Dallas Barr stopped   *>
 <* writting, then (C)uT grinded to a halt.                                *>

The Software Crypt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All versions of DOS (1.00 +) have a program called Label. Label is used to name
or rename the volume label of a certain drive. Label is a rarely used program
that can prove to be very useful in hacking programming. When trying to program
a Trojan that will format the hard drive (C:) the "Enter current volume
label:" prompt will appear thus halting the format. Using Label to rename the
volume label nothing will end this problem. The following are two examples of
Trojans using the Label and Format programs:

1: Echo Off
2: Label .>Nul
3: Echo Y|Format c:

1: Echo off
2: Label ???>Nul
3: Format c:
4: Echo ???>Nul
5: Echo Y>Nul

 <* My God!  DiS iZ AweSUm!!  GeT Dis In PHraK!!  No, but really, that was  *>
 <* pretty pathetic.  Even the FiS lessons in basic were better (not much). *>
 <* I don't consider batch a good programming language.                     *>

Viruses
~~~~~~~
Viruses are probably the most effective corrupt program ever created for 
computer hacking. However there are ways to avoid them. A simple virus scanner
will detect the presence of MOST known viruses and a virus remover will remove
the viruses found. With all the virus protection utilities available  today
it seems much more difficult to use viruses successfully. The following are a
few methods of successful virus use:

1: Probably the best means of successful use of viruses is using a program 
called PKLITE. Pklite is a program made by the same people who brought us 
Pkzip and Pkunzip as well as many other such archive programs. Pklite is used
to shrink programs yet still allow them to be run normally. Thus if a virus
is compressed with Pklite it takes on a whole new byte size and form and thus
cannot be scanned.

 <* Wrong.  As long as the PKLITE header is in the file, then Scan will *>
 <* detect it.                                                          *>

2: Another effective virus disguising method is to rename the virus infected
.COM or .EXE file to a file such as .OBJ or .001. These types of files are not
usually scanned by virus scanners thus making a good virus hiding technique.
Note: This method works only on viruses that do not infect the Boot sector.

 <* Gee, what about "scan /a" for example? *>

3: Finnaly the use of new and undetectable viruses can be quite effective. 
Despite the fact that little is known on the effect and reliability of these
viruses they can be very effective.

MCI Madness
~~~~~~~~~~~
MCI codes have become more and more popular among hackers as well as deranged
message posters. They can be used to display a users information (seen ONLY by
the user himself) but can also be used as a methode of freezing almost ALL 
Telegard Bulletin Board Systems. Such methods are:

1: When filling out a new user application enter [@2 + garbage (dsfgdldf) when
prompted for "Real Name". Continue the application normally. When the system
reviews the user's statistics it will freeze up just before the "Real Name"
is displayed. The system will stay off-line until the SysOp reboots the system.

2: At certain menus such MCI codes as @Q and @E (Unreconisable to the system)
can be used producing the freeze up as well.

The follwoing is a list of MCI codes which can be used in message bases:

1: @1 - Displays user's Alias
2: @2 - Displays user's Real Name
3: @3 - Displays user's Phone Number
4: @4 - Displays user's City and State
5: @5 - Displays user's Address
6: @6 - Displays user's Zip Code
7: @7 - Clears screen
8: @8 - Pauses for a few seconds
9: @9 - Pause string
10: @! - Toggles user's ability to abort message
11: @# - Toggles "Pause when screen is full" feature

 <* Now this is hacking!  I could reprogramm NASA with this.  Have the   *>
 <* world by the balls.  i B ElEeT CuZ i n0We H0W 2 HaK WiV McI k0DeZ!!! *>
 <* I truly believe that recopying a page from the Telegard manual was   *>
 <* the maximum any (C)uT member could achieve.                          *>

Corrupt Headlines
[---------------]
With the sudden surge of new Hacking/Phreaking groups, the end of the corrupt
computer underground seems nowhere in sight. However, a reliable source has
indicated what could be a major crackdown by the RCMP upon the corrupt computer
underground. According to this source, the RCMP is now gathering as much 
information as possible before they launch their attack. Apparantly the first
to be hit will be the Bulleting Board Systems who support Hacking/Phreaking
information and material. Following the support sites will be the groups 
themselves who create the material and distribute it. The crackdown is 
estimated to begin within a month, but that is but an estimate. The outcome of
this attack by the RCMP is still unknow, but is sure to be a painful blow 
towards the corrupt computer underground.

 <* Lame.  Kids trying to attract attention to themselves by releasing    *>
 <* bullshit information like this.  I guess they really do need friends. *>

*Note: For further information on this RCMP crackdown, please read the RCMP.CUT
       text included in this Corrupt News package.

Carding Basics: Part I
[---------------------]
Carding plays a major role in the corrupt computer underground world of today.
Carding consists of the illegal use of Calling or Creadit Cards for personal
gain. Due to their high risque factor, Calling Cards have become absolete and
thus rarely used. However Credit Cards are still frequently used in the corrupt
computer underground world. There are several methods of acquiring a Credit 
Card number and information. One method is known as "Trashing". This technic,
although rather dirty, is very effective. After locating a large trash bin also
known as a dumpster, often found behind large stored of shopping malls, search
as many carbons or Credit Card receipts as possible. Afterwards take note of 
all the information on the carbons and receipts and then discard the carbons 
and receipts. This is done mainly for security reasons. After the Credit Card 
number and information have been acquired, the type of card must be determined
if it is not given with the information. The use of the two following charts
should be implied to determine the Credit Card type and number format.

 <* I'd be willing to bet that not a single one of these guys has either *>
 <* been trashing, or has ever carded anything.                          *>
       
First Digit Of Credit Card Number | Credit Card Type
----------------------------------|-----------------
               3                  | American Express
               4                  | Visa
               5                  | MasterCard
               6                  | Discover 
----------------------------------------------------

Credit Card Number Format | Credit Card Type
--------------------------|-----------------
3XXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX         | American Express
4XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX       | Visa
5XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX       | MasterCard
6XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX       | Discover
--------------------------------------------

The Credit Card must be then verified. This may be done by contacting a local
Credit Card service line.

 <* This file is proof that (C)uT was sewer shit.  They stole the above     *>
 <* from an old carding file by UPI.  Proof?  Well both files have the same *>
 <* error for the VISA number format.  VISA has 2 number formats,  and the  *>
 <* one given here is almost obselete compared to the other 13 number       *>
 <* format.                                                                 *>

Two months later and no sign of the RCMP cracking down on the corrupt computer
underground. However the RCMP did pull the plug on one of Montreal's greatest
BBSs, 90 North. This comes as quite a chock considering 90 North's extensive
existence, however all good things must come to an end. This month also marked
the end of yet another group. The HackIng Federation [HiF], most notably known
for doing nothing, has disolved. The demise of the group is of no loss to the
corrupt computer underground and proves that only the strong survive. In other
news, the sudden surge in "H/C/P/V/A" support sites has sent many SysOps of 
these sites in search of "H/C/P/V/A" material. However an astonishing amount of
this material has turned out to be falsely described or even non-existant. Many
viruses that are now available from most "H/C/P/V/A" sites are simply existing
viruses that have been renamed. As well many "Unscannable" viruses have turned
up as being nothing but blank files. Furthermore, many trojans are non-existant
or are replicas of previously produced trojans. In order to prevent unhappy 
hackers from waisting valuable file points on non-existant material, SysOps of 
"H/C/P/V/A" support sites are urged to scan and or test ALL "H/C/P/V/A" 
material available from their Bulletin Board System.

The Trojan Generator v1.0 [(C)opyRight Corrupt WareZ 1991' (C)uT (Tm)]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Trojan Generator v1.0 is a trojan generator designed for amateur hackers. 
It's purpose is to generate one of three selected trojans. These trojans 
include:

BOOT.COM - Overwrites BOOT Sector
ROOT.COM - Overwrites ROOT Directory
FORMAT.COM - Overwrites Disk(s) 

Although quite primitive, The Trojan Generator v1.0 serves it's purpose. The
updated version [2.0] soon to be released, will include more generatable 
trojans as well as extended options.

 --

    By reading the above 3 issues, we can see that (C)uT was far worse than
 anyone could have imagined.  This group was only the latest in a frenzy of
 hacking groups such as FiS, HiF, HiT, VOiD, and, almost as bad, anti-hacker
 groups like GAH, that admitted to be nothing but wanna-be informants.
 Problem is there was nothing to inform, since none of the other groups did
 anything, except freeze a bbs with the good old @2 trick.  But let's look at
 (C)uT for a moment.  First off, the (C) in (C)uT only shows that the members
 were rejected pirates, because they were to stupid to play the games like the
 other waReZW0lVeZ.  So, what do you do when you are to dumb to get accepted
 in a community like the pirating community (no matter how lame it may be)?
 You form a group bent on destroying pirates and their boards.  This would be
 almost acceptable if they actually served a purpose, but the whole idea is
 self-defeating.  None of the members have any knowledge about programming or
 real hacking/phreaking.  All they are good for is spreading viruses (that
 they obviously did not write) and listing definitions from "Uncle Tom's
 Infoform Generator".  This is in addition to ripping off text files from
 other groups, and reprinting them without even checking the mistakes.  Next,
 the idea of publicising a board (PRI-VATE) that never existed is incredibly
 pathetic.  When I inquired about the number, repsonses were the following:
 "HaY!!# Y0u R n0t El8 EnUfF@#@!!!"
 "It's down for upgrading"
 "We changed the number, and are waiting before releasing it."
 and my favorite
 "The board is under RCMP surveillance now.  We'll tell you later."
 When I finally got to know Phrozen Virus (aka Bleeding Maggot), he admitted
 that it never existed, and this is why he changed boards in issue #3.  Also,
 the other board, The Jungle (in issues #1 and #2) was nothing more than a
 collection of GIFs and other porno animations.  It even had a (C)uTNet.
 Problem was, being the only board, he didn't even need FD to be installed to
 network.  A one board net!  What a novell idea!  Cheap too.  Also, the
 writers fascinnation with using "corrupt" at every line.  Corrupt programming
 is, in my idea, the area of programming that deals with viruses.  Apart from
 that it applies to bribes and pay-offs, something that does not apply to the
 h/p underground.  Since they had no programming knowledge, except for the
 awesome display of DOS batch programming, (C)uT was about as corrupt as my
 velveeta is when it passes the expiration date by over a month.  A moldy
 piece of worthless cheese.  That describes rather adequately the members of
 (C)uT.  In any case, I hope we never see another group like this, and I hope
 514 will have learned it's lesson and never form another assembly of losers
 like these groups were.


                    Fear me as you would fear yourself...


 %Another one:

    A few weeks ago, I got hold of a magazine called Psycho Breakdown.  Aside
 from the v0mIt colored VGA loader (which was about as big as the text
 itself), Psycho Breakdown contained various rags and captures from 514 users
 and boards.  First off, let me say that I enjoyed the magazine just about as
 much as the loader, which compares with running my eyeballs up and down a
 cheese gratter, while chewing on razor blades.  No matter what it says,
 Psycho Breakdown is a cheap ripoff of HDK.  It's the typical story:
 Kids have no life.
 Kids see something that they like.
 Kids copy the something that they like.
 Kids excpect to get life.
 Kids still have no life and die a miserable, lonely death.
 The magazine was not signed, which, right away proves that the authors don't
 have much guts, and admit that modeming is as close to a social life they
 will ever have.  Next, it wasen't funny.  Oh, sure, it had the joke about the
 lower cased 'i' (wonder where those jokes came from), and a few rags on users
 I have never seen before, but apart from captures, I have not seen one bit of
 creative writting, or even a well thought out and well structured insult.
 Because insulting someone is an art, not just something you spit out at
 someone.  So before you kids (and I use the term carefully, since I don't
 consider immature single celled organisms as kids) go out and try to match
 HDK by flinging a few insults at people, and doing it anonymously, be sure
 that people like me will be watching you very closely.

    Well, I thought I had seen it all as far as HDK clones went when I
 finished off Psycho Breakdown.  Well no, I was wrong.  A few days ago, I got
 a copy of TPT Magazine.  Now, this one was even more of a HDK copy than the
 previous.  I don't know who wrote it (and frankly I'd rather shave with a
 snow shuvel than find out) but how fucking lame do you have to be to take
 the same jokes as HDK, and rewrite them with different words?  GET A LIFE!
 Get some inspiration you geek.  Well I lied, I do know who wrote it.  Black
 Ice.  Enough said.

    Now, once and for all, in case you iDi0TZ haven't figured it out yet.
 Write your stupid little magazine, rag on everyone and anyone, but at least
 try and be original.  This mindless copying get's you nowhere.  Might as well
 rename HDK and send that out, it's almost as bad.  And for God's sake, leave
 me and/or HDK out of the greets.  I don't even want to see the names in the
 file.  That means that if I take PCtools (4.3, cause I'm a LaMUr) and hit
 (F)ind the string HDK, it better not stop on your stupid magazine.  Let's put
 it another way, so you 25 IQ geniuses have a chance to grasp it.  If you're
 writting your magazine, and you hit the letters h, d and k in a row, I'm
 buying a set of stinger missiles.  One for you, one for what's left.  Got it?
 We will see.


              z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!z00m!


 %Idiot of the year:

    Although the nameless, anonymous slugs seemed up front for the loser of
 the year award, along with our favorite targets, Sgt. RaTTleBrEad and PsyChIc
 D0nUt, the last weeks have brought on a new candidate for this formidable
 award.  A person who's very being oozes with idiocy and looserness (eliteness
 and d00dness in general).  So, for this year that be 1992, the award goes to:
 Bagman.  Sadly, our budget prevents us from having an award ceremony, since
 our staff is busy spending the money on Gringo Pizza, Tequilla, and Twinkies.
 So this file will serve as last and only testimony of this great person that
 be Bagman.  The following is a capture of some of Bagman's best moments,
 followed by some small comments.  Comments in the captures are bracketed by

XX> Um.. Have you opened your BBS like you said you were going to?

Hey this is one of the "few" boards you'll see me on, as for warez yeah its up
to about 600 megs (zips) a month month now much more if I went for all that
gif/mod/rol etc. shit, yeah I've spoken to "Mr. Bozak/Goliath the other week
and of course Mr. former HP bigshot was begging for software just like the
rest of those assholes from the Statute #2 as for the BBS decided it wasn't
worth the hassle heh even a big BBS person like Wong quit after having a board
up for a couple of months!
So how's all your "good buddies" like Sgt Rattlehead and Pychic Demon? and now
I hear you hang around LOTS with The Beer Wolf you must be maschocist seeing
that whiner one time was more than enough hey you get The Hitman as part of

Heh heh no more "new network" with them every month yeah you wouldn't get most
anybody to admit they hang around with those TWINS but admit it your
"assisting" The Beer Wolf and Thrasher with their latest bomb ehehehe; as I
was saying it was your long lost former Co-sysop Mr. Bozak who upon changing
his alias to Goliath trashed you and Pychic Demon (he can never live down that
he was co-sysop to both of you) hung around with those giant losers Pr.
Sinister and Dr. Crippen and became this so-called big HP person well he did
have alot of pbx's and the one's I got off him did work so he must know
somebody.  Ah but who cares I only use pbx's and 1-800's for voice and not to
go on the Alliance 24 hours a day like the BBS Bouncer used to.  The rest of
the time its warez and more warez and more......

Say your name constantly in posts on Doubt in regards to their "project" so
figured you were involved (guess your not the masochist I thought you were
that Beer Wolf is hopeless), so how many people you know that started acting
"all elite" when they got their 14.4's even a lamer like Pychic Demon went on
with his "9600 only" on his crappy bbs, as for pbx's hehe you really don't
expect me to give them out why don't you ask those "public benefactors" Rock
Steady and Pure Energy or even Dr. Detergent they'll be happy "to give it to

him is bound to be just about banged through and he'll boast on and on on how
he such a generous person giving it to all "the saps that is" you know its
just about traced same goes for any pbx from Dr. Detergent (specially if he
says your his friend mouhahaha) look I just use them for an odd ld voice call
so I don't give a shit much but enough people have been burned by their TRACED
NUMBERS, hmm you could check The Adept but I doubt he's giving out to anybody
other than his Commodore buddies.  Well since your not a file person (not much
I don't think) guess you want the pbx to get on the pirate nets and  qwk the
messages thats pretty good better than going on Sinister's super lame Lab with
its Cybercrimenet.  So how's your board going so many people's going down its
hard to keep track unless your The Black One he's on EVERY ONE hehehe.

 Ok, so up to know, Mr. BAgMan has insulted a vast number of people.  Here's a
 small list, up to now:

 1 - Goliath
 2 - Sgt. Rattlehead
 3 - Psychic Demon
 4 - The Beerwolf
 5-  Hitman
 6 - Vindicator
 7 - Thrasher
 8 - Pr. Sinister
 9 - Dr. Crippen
 10- BBS Bouncer
 11- Rock Steady
 12- Pure Energy
 13- Dr. Detergent
 14- The Adept

 I might have forgotten some.  Anyways, some of those are losers, and some I
 don't even know, but I do see some people who I would respect more than
 Bagman any day.  Actually, the only thing I would do for Bagman is light the
 match if he was in a puddle of gasoline.  Anyways, we see from this that
 Bagman loves to mouth off about things he has no understanding of, or people
 he thinks aren't watching.

 Now here is where things get real interresting (and explicit).

-> Greets,
->      Moi ? on every board <grin> hehe! as for wintermute I don't have
-> the number either and I think (just a feeling) that it is a ld from

So Harridan will just have to find it for himself, I was speaking to somebody
today who used to be on Wintermute; at least he went on everybody's hero
Silver Hawk and did nothing but leech, seemed that Case had an agreement with
Silver Hawk who was co of Ghostland (the great former INC site) and they were
supposed to have reciprocal leeching, boy did Case get stiffed with The Ghost
went belly up and dry; kept trying to leech off me.

-> St-Lambert, so I'm not even looking for it, Gamezone and the lab's
-> nup's are another story though...

Well Gamezone should be no problem to get you the NUP as I know enough people
on that board (which btw is dying the top u/l are leaving and the Game Warden
is "crying" for warez, as one former top u/l told me "I just go on it to
leech old games"

Now The Lab is another matter, surely Harridan must know it as I heard that
he used to have oh so much "fun" with his peaceful discussions with the other
users, as for myself you know what I think of those two superlosers Pr.
Sinister and Dr. Crippen, I'm still waiting for their next Statute Mag.

Well if you'd look into any Flt file you'd see his board still listed so
thats all the publicity he needs

The shock and crime of it all Black One not being able to call a board !!!!!!
guess you'll just have to settle for 99% ahahahaha, as for Silver Hawk well
at least me and Sun Blazer got rid of him for the summer and part of the fall
but now he looks to be back for good, well at least nobody's heard of Hitman
since Psycho #1 came out.

-> Dunno what you're refering too :).. No seriously, Pr.Sinister is
-> still a good friend. He's a good guy, if you don't know him you
-> should speak

When I first saw Pr. Sinister posting on one net POD (I think) he insulted
and swore at every single user he was posting to and I'm thinking what kind
of asshole is this; then I find out Dr. Crippen is worse I mean how can
anybody have any respect for guys like this, then with their first Statute
"only for the Elites" like they and The Lab are so Elite, most people I spoke
to felt the same way, the others well they are the one's who suck up to
ANYBODY they think is cool or Elite even Rock Steady!

-> like this. They had their motivations for Statue.. Crippen is another

Yeah, I understand mostly to rag on Darkman, well I understood that if
anybody deserved that it was Darkman, probably the most hated user out there
this past year (and with good reason) but when they Goliath/Mr. Bozak/Daniel
Yahbow go blasting me for being all talk about having files then it gets
personal, so I challenged The Lab (none of the gutless people I knew on The
Lab would post it) to a software contest most in a month I even was willing
to let them include My Bullshit System, but he chickened out, ha at this
point I'd even throw in Gamezone then when I wipe them all off the face of
the earth they be forced to retract.

-> like this. They had their motivations for Statue.. Crippen is another
-> story. I believe we are still in good terms but I havn't talked with
-> him for months.. He's semi-retired now..

Don't see how as he listed as being a courier for TDT guess he didn't like
the demotion from FLT, oh well nobody misses those ansi's he had of inflated
ego "Super Courier" now if only the same could happen to Symetric Shadow and
his mile long ansi's and he's not even in INC!

Sorry, it just pissed me off when it got released and then I had to have that
quoted to me from every lamo who thought that since "the Lab is so Elite"
what they said must be true, hey I agree files aren't a measure of Eliteness
or you'd have some people with really bad attitudes like Spread, Stamp and
Red Scorpion etc. as the Elitest!  Besides its only the Mystic losers of the
bbs scene who think that way.

After much consideration this past spring I decided against thinking I'd be
moving out of town in September instead I'm leaving end of next month so no

You got that right many of the file people I know are very secluded (paranoid
maybe) don't like to post unless posted to never want to draw attention to
themselves (unlike myself) but they like myself are collectors and as
collectors value an application first then utilities and maybe a game here or
there, now the WaReZ d00dZ like Mystic Vision or Rodimus well they make me
sick, blasting great apps away because its more than a week old, belive me I
still use enough favorites, how many people around here still use Norton

That didn't do him on good with Spread, I remember when he "told" Spread that
since he's "INC courier" he has to have no ratio, Spread kicked his ass right
of Twins ehehe, besides which what files does have ever bring in the city
(not thats there's much of any INC stuff anyways).

-> You mind shutting up that spewing sewer you call a mouth? It's pretty
-> damn easy to go and insult Darkman behind his back, but I haven't
-> seen you tell that to his face. No one deserved Statute 2, except
-> maybe you.

I should have known a giant loser like you would show up, well why don't you
make me shaddup you mewling hunk of keyboard sperm.  And fylamer information
I did tell him so in posts and I would just as soon tell him in his face with
his phony electronic warfare bluster but at least Xanadu is long gone now if
only the same happened to you I know nobody in this city would miss you.

This not being my board, I'll hold back a little, but you will hear more from
me soon. Anyways, are you so sure about that last line? What makes you any
different? Do you thing that you are so special that people would miss you?
When I look at you, all I see is some 14 year old, zit face, out of control
hormones filled kid who spend his life d/ling wares. You say 600 megs/month?
That's 20megs/day, you obviously have no life. Do you think that if you would
dissapear, anyone would miss you? Does anyone know you? That's apart from
your cock jocking, ass sucking, Freddy Mercury wanna-be boyfriends. What the
hell do you contribute? You give nothing to society, you just take up space.
ALl I see from you, is your big cock sucking adapted mouth flapping around
insulting people. People who have got it over you anyday. No, not there dicks
over you, don't get an errection and knock over the computer, I meant a life.
Although it would be hard for you to knock over the table, considering you
can't even lift your zipper. I guess the only way you can knock over the
computer, is when one of your crem puff boyfriends comes, and humps you while
your watching som fag .GIFs. That's when you start crashing your head into
the screen. That would also explain why you are so stupid, brain dammage does
appear quickly when people bang your head in the alley behind the gay
stripper club. Next time wear a helmet, like the Green fudge Packers helmet.
Or wear an inverted jockstrap, so you don't have to worry about onme of your
cousins coming and banging your fudge so hard. Now, I could go on for hours,
but it's not my board, and I'll respect the sysop (not want to suck his dick
like you would do for ratio), but I will be getting you soon, very soon, so
look out.

ALso, look at what time you posted to me. 4:02 am? Do you have a life? Get a
job, go to school. Normal, self respecting, humans have to get up and work in
the morning. My God, I guess you just finished your shift, and are returnong
home from a busy night on the streets. Did some 65 year old wrinkled up fag
offer you $20 for a blow? How much did you make tonight, or do you want to
get paid in wares? I know, 1 meg, one blow. That would explain the 20
megas/day you get.

Well, Darkman is not as bad as some people think. First, when i learned 
about is "other name" and i spread it for personnal fun. Then he learned 
about that and called me voice.. Well, he sounded wierd but the guy was 
actually very polite and had a cool attitude. Then, i shut my mouth, cuz he
is not as looser as you think.

First of all I have 12 locals out of 80 user, so you do the calculations.
Next, Goliath probably knows more on equifax/cbi alone theat you know about
everything (or nothing in this case).

straight, I HATE ANSI and everything that revolves around it. I think it's
ugly, slow, and a waste of time. I have NEVER posted an ANSI for my board,
and never will, and don't even have/want one to post.

Let's start with Statute #2 now everybody knows that the focus of that mag
was on ragging Darkman (nobody including Pr. and Crippen) have said
otherwise; (speaking of Darkman you still jealous that Ray is sharing his bed
rather than you "I feel for you").

To continue the focus was as they said fully on Darkman and on Phrozen
Tormentor who obviously did nothing that he promised (over and over for
months) those facts are substantiated so I can't see what that was the cause
of your breakup with the Twins (my my two-timing on Darkman with Phrozen
Tormentor for SHAME!) though that was a terrible pity for if any three people
belonged in a permanent menage-a-trois it was you guyZ.

Ah but your fortunate you get to be a star soon yourself because rumour has
it that BAD is gonna write an article about you mainly about your pathetic
board and bad attitude that'll be fun to read.

 <* Hahahaha.  BAD?  #9 was released, was I in it?  No.  Truth is, Flaming *>
 <* Chaos (301) is a BAD site, and on my board, so...  Too bad FAGiE.      *>

Speaking of your pathetic board just what is it you do other than "FAIL" to
break in to banks and wait for calls from the Bay all day long they sure
haven't tought you anything at Polytechnique sad, but true.

 <* Break into banks?  I won't even get into that.  Just to say that I    *>
 <* NEVER talked about this in public, so obviously BaGIe is lying again. *>

For when it all comes down to it your just a MCI SPRINTER wannabe and look

but `Grow up' your even older than myself. Take some guts and be a MAN, it 
may be hard... 
 
But someday you'll understand downloading warez results you to nothing. 
To think that 99% of your time on your computer is wasted watching Zmodem! 
Do you know computers have other features? That warez don't touch upon? Why
did you get a modem? Hot Warez? Faster 0days? Look cool? it was a waste of 
the thousands... Then again bagman, we can continue our little `think' 
personally it may be alot more fun now with equifax on my side... But I 
wait for you to do the first move...
 
You brought talk about `Breaking into Bank Computers' apparently you 
haven't read NuKE infojournal #5, all you need to know on IBMs 4700s Unix 
based systems only used by, Royal,National,TD Banks... And yeah nice hot 
CAPTURES for those that are not totally inclined to reading... And this is 
all crap never published before... `The Spirit' was SOOO near in finishing 
this, till he got put away from little old RCMP, see Mechanix and I have 
been around for ages now, And quite active indeed, you can rate that 
success in our great success in locking ALL you dicks out! And yes my NuKE 
system has only but a mere 4  (514) users... counting ME,Mechanix and the 
main Sysop PureEnergy... leaving 1 more 514 in... Not bad, and most of you 
thought nuke was dead... HAH, you can check THESE NewsPapers & Magzines for
our GREAT success...

Thats ONLY what I keep track of... Not counting facts that chaos we cause 
is leading the USA gov't to try to pass a bill to monitor, tap, digital 
lines, Fierce punisment acts towards Hackers, and the list goes on... I'll 
be representing myself on the BIG March conference on Computer Secuirty, 
apparently NuKE is on the agenda for Virus inflitration... 

But last but not least, your all in for you BIGGEST surprise yet, and YES, 
I'm the new HOT courier for your 0 dayz... and I will NOT bring then to 
Montreal, I'll be bringing them to Bigger places and have the little guys 
bringing them here... and HOW do you ask can you get these amazing little 
warez? Chances are you already GOT THEM! hah... And All of Nortons or Scan 
or F-PRot or VSHEILD or VIRSTOP or anything for that matter will help 
you... the viruses are perhaps even smarter than YOU, and that will be 
proven indeed!

TaTa Rocky!
                   haha I've gone MAD indeed, and I'm glad!

All right, this has been going on for long enough. If you can't find
arguments other than those pathetic remarks about sex and masturbation, just
shut the fuck up.

BTW, It's not Phrozen Tormentor, but Frozen Tormentor. And the guy has
nothing to do with H/P or all this, neither has Darkman and Higlander. leave

Ok, I didn't start any of this, in fact I didn't even post him but hey your
the boss I have no problem ending this; now we can get back to discussions
about "warez" and tape backups sure are a lot of people wanting to pick one
up these days and why not diskettes are dead I've been considering this other
model by Colorado called the Powertape and it can hold 2.4 Gigs of info 1.2
compressed for just $1000 and the 2.4 Gig model is $1800 pretty good no more
of these 125/250 meg jumbo one's software is getting too big too quick, as
for the Tracker 2(the tracker 1 is only QIC 40 compatible) while doing 9 megs
a minute is pretty steep at $500+ and it takes 2 hours to format with that
one "killer" and still only holds as much as the jumbo which is half the
price vs the Powertape which while holding the 1.2 Gig also backups/restores
at a DAT speed 18 megs a minute!!

 Sun Blazer told me you liked bothering people. Listen Mechanix never ask 
me about an ansi."DID YOU GET THAT". And why would i be scared shitless, 
this just a hobby, I do for fun. So why the fuck would i be scared. Let me 
recall and i could support from some other people when you called me in 
juin telling me you were going to open up a board 2gigs 2 nodes. and you 
were asking me if you could be site of LTD. and you wanted to be site in 
all these other groups. Yeah well that's your probleme but Dont ever start 
rumors about this shit. if you want to do it in private.

 You should go back the warez man, People and talking dont match with you.

-> Compare as we dare...Bagman trying to `fight' Mechanix... Have you
-> NOTICED no one dares to back you? Have you got no friends?

Got enough in the background, but on line whadda considering how gutless most
user are many of them are constantly sucking up and will change their postion
on anything eg. Mr. Brownstone, BBS Bouncer and I can name many others, I on
the other hand have no problem posting what I mean and stating exactly what I

You really don't know what your talking about:

Fact I:   I'm only on one 2400 board and that has been the case for at least
4 months and mostly what I did on those 2400 systems was play doors and post
till I got used to them at higher speeds and lost interest in playing them at
2400.

Fact II:  Half the boards I'm on I'm there soley to post.

Fact III: I have a tape backup for file transfers why waste time with d/l and
u/l when trade is so much simpler.  And the rest of the time do what I want
on the computer.

->   "Hah shit, I can't use the phone"  no shit, I ramed dailed you for
-> days
-> that time... and to think I left Vanier Computers on to ram dail
-> you... hehe... ahh the good old days... They can still always return!

All it did was show your incompetence as it had literally no effect and you
don't see me whining about it 'a la Mechanix'

 <* He only wishes he could. *>

-> of fact lets see if I got your data still. I now I got the number...
-> A name can come easy... and ofcourse lets hope you don't have any
-> legit credit. Equifax is a mighty powerful tool, expecially my access
-> to it is totally legit.

DO IT, I laugh at your attempts and for what "you think" (thats a joke) you
can dig up.

-> You brought talk about `Breaking into Bank Computers' apparently you

You forgot about The Bay having caught him well NOBODY else has.

 <* The Bay having caught me?  If that was true, then I wouldn't be *>
 <* around today.  More lies.                                       *>

All I see is Rock Steady and his haha brass knuckle having to "protect"
Mechanix probably from another former 15 year old Nuke member from kicking
his (19 year old) face in at the Pacifist Ahahaha whose gonna be next Psychic
Demon, Telepathic Slayer everybody's still laughing at him.

 <* This guy is really stoned.  What in the world is he talking about?   *>
 <* Also, I am not 19, and trust me, do not need anyone to "protect" me. *>

-> thought nuke was dead...

As I told Mechanix I don't give a shit about HP'ing so save your BORING
speeches.

I'll leave it off with this

Rock Steady/514: Class-A loser.  The leader of the loser [VDL] trio, This guy
is the main reason I left NuKE.  He spends all his days ragging on people and
posting bullshit (that nobody understands because he can't write for shit). 
He also wardialed my board a few days back, but I fixed the problem now, and
it won't happen again.  He has fun calling people "Game Lamers" when I have
captures of Sysops telling me how much he enjoys to leech the newest games
off the boards.  Worst of all is you already know about everything he does,
because he's always blabbing about how he finished a virus, or hacked a PBX. 
Anyways just ignore him, that's what I do.

Kind of summs it up!

Haha, true the Class-A loser that tries to look good ends with a CLASS-A 
attempt to get back at me... Are you sure your over 20 years of age... 
Mentally you act you seem to act like a kid... 
 
No, am Not; are too; am not you are; are not....
 
your reasoning is almost amazing... it does explain why a kid like you can 
spend 25/24 hours on a System watch Zmodem... I heard it before, you don't 
d/l your Warez get sent to you by Line noice... I heard that one, in case 
your going to run that once more...
 
BTW: your ABOVE Message is perhaps the LAMEST ONE I'VE FUCKEN SEEN, that 
showed up 1 year ago in Statue #2... I JUST UNBELEIVABLE Stun that not only
a fucken 25 year can bare send me a legit reply (Maybe cuz his small 
fingers press down tooooo many keys at the same time, so he captures a 
reply because it doesn't know FUCKEN DICK on me or anything else...)
 
BTW: who are the Trio, VDL??? or anything of that matter? You have 
succeeded that you know much of me, thru from what others read... BTW: 
mechanix has voided that responce as it was due a force of `revenge' 
towards me for what I tempted to do onto him during our `warrior' days...
 
So I get some real INFO asshole... A lamer will be a lamer... And Bagman is
just the perfect name to represent your charactor... however I do 
recommend to add `FAT-Ass' in between Bag and man... So what do you say? 
will you do that for me?

your grey-matter, I couldn't even light a firecracker.  Maybe that's what 
you need, a firecracker, to jump start your existence into what normal
humans call a life.  As I do not consider sitting in front of a screen,
with a dildo up your ass, connected to a vibrating lazy-boy, with pizza
crusts and toffu steak lying around in your half run-down, slime covered, 
fungus growing, mold infested, cockroach motel, locust inhabited shit
hole you might call a house, a life.  Go get a life.  No actually, commit 
suicide right now, it's hopeless, you will never evolve into any life
form higher than a algee or fungus.  You know, the kind of brown fungus
that grows on the side of your asshole.  The one that you see floating in 
the toilet bowl with drops of blood clinging to it, right after you spew
out another load of all-bran fermented shit.   Ever wonder why the fungus 
tried to climb out of the bowl whn you flushed?  It's because that little 
piece of mold has more life and IQ than you could have in your pittyfull
existence.  Or maybe you don't flush?  Yes, that's it, you just gather
the products of your disease and make sandwiches to feed yourself while
you go pounding away on that gravis joystick, the one you spent all your
social welfare money on.  
Now, all I'll do is just sit here and keep flinging out these posts at
you until either:
1 - You shut up, go away, or die.
2 - I get real pissed and decide to shut you up myself.
Rock Steady, on the other hand, will go straight for option -2- and will
devote his days to making your life a living hell.  He'll fucking destroy 
you.  I'll actually have fun seeing how your miserable life get's worse
every day, until we finally never hear form you again.

 Well there you have it.  By this time, I hope Bagman is in Vancouver, so I
 never have to see his bullshit ever again.

    Well, the 514 open forum on TPR is going great.  We have had a lot of
 messages, with no ragging, something that was lacking in your average 514
 BBS.  In any case, we are always open to new ideas, so if you want to call,
 just follow this.  Remember, it is optionally anonymous.

 1- Connect to 514-738-2105 (2400 f0r YoU k00l HiGh SpeED D00DEZ).
 2- Input "FORUM" at the prompt.
 3- Use account "FORUM", password "OPEN".
 4- You're in.

    And lastly, here's a little something offered to you from the unethical,
 lunatic masses that make up TPR's user list.  It should follow a logical
 thread, but you never know when insanity takes a part.  All phone numbers
 have been edited for privacy.
