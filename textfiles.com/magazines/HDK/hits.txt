Ok, well I'll ask. What's this HiTS shit? Another lame ass group? I should of
known, look at the k-rad spelling with the small cased 'i'. Listen guys, get a
clue. Your group probably sucks, and it will most certainly die within the next
month... Give it up, bunch of lame assholes. Here, join my group. ANSiD00DEZ!
Haha, you should fit right in.

And and now? You wanted some publicity? You've got it, monkey! Now, get your
banana and let intelligent people talk about something more interesting.

I don't think The Judge would really appreciate if we start war here, give me
the phone number of your board, I'm gonna nuke you there, it's more practical
for everyone don't you think?

Just RELAX and enjoy, I guess you're gonna make it like us one day, don't
despair, If you've got the will, you can do more than just run after people
yelling they're lamer than you!

Ok, you want to go? Well here I am, dust off the silver. You want a private
war? No problem, I can destroy you even more since I don't have the rest of
your HiTS friends butting in. So, you think you can "nuke" me? Interresting
choice of words, I guess you still remember NuKE as being the ONLY 514 group
that ever made an impact. Even though I quit, it sure is better than your ego
inflating acronymn that you get to stick after your lame handle. Yes, that's
right, look at the k-rad elite spelling: "BloodMATRiX". Did you put the MATRiX
in caps so you could put that small cased 'i' in it? Do you think this makes
you look better? Does it please you to rob someone elses idea and abuse it for
yourself? Here, look, MECHANiX! I'm elite to, I can use a 'i'! Oh, but I
forgot, to be elite like you I have to be in some k-rad group that doesn't do
shit and has some stupid definition attached. So, here: MECHANiX [TiTS]! Happy?
DOes this make as cool as you? Anyways, I'm tired of you, I will destroy you
some other time. Wanted my board number? 738-2105. Have fun with it, I might
even let you on to let some of my users have a go at you, it's always more fun
when we're more than one. I guess you should call some of your little TiTS
frineds to come and help you, or they to busy? Maybe they are to busy humping
themselves in front of those .GL animations you download off your elite art
boards. Maybe they cummed on the keyboard, and now all the keys are stuck so
they can't type. Or maybe they cummed down there own throats (most being
contorsionnists) and they dried there airway shut, and died. Or even more
probable is that you have no friends and that are calling boards under many
aliases. Maybe the group is only one person: you, and perhaps two or three of
your imaginary boyfriends, that you fantatsize sucking each night. So, before I
fucking cremate you like the rodent that you are, take your lame little group,
and stick to your lame little art boards, and stay out of my way, or I *will*
get rid of you, and you will have to change aliases once again, maybe to
something even more elite, like iNSiPiD iDiOT! Lot's of 'i's in that one,
should make you the k00lest d00d in 514. Later fool.

Hey, Mechanix, I don't know what you are up to, but I'm not going to be as
arrogant as you've been with us, just to proove you how much lamer you may be
compared to us!

We are *NOT* ANOTHER ANSI D00DEZZZzz Groups (We HATE K-Rads like YOU), we're
doing the best of us to produce REAL demos, you know like Future crew and the
others and guess what? WE're going to make it! We'll release something soon I
guess, I'm not gonna give any dates out anyway.

And did you know there is ONLY 2 groups in AMERICA to do our kind of stuff? No
uh? And do you know we're the only ones in the Whole Canada and Quebec? I guess
no, you're lacking of culture man, that's not good to your brains if you've got
some. And you're now the only one to oppose against us. I really suggest that
you calm your little ass and enjoy our demos and utilities. If I'd be you, I
should be proud to know us as a good representative group of the 514.

SO, I want you to appologize right NOW!

If you really want to know, you're one of the pains in the 514, so cool it down
if you want to regain some credibility. Yeah, I know, you're in the H/P/C/V
etc.
    .. But I DON'T CARE!!! I do only care that you're a stupid asshole trying
to start war with a bunch of great programmers! You'll se you've been wrong one
day, you'll see I was right.. But I'll NEVER forget what you've said, that's
the LAMEST remark I've seen since I'm in business (8 years now, Probably twice
as much as you? No, more than that? So you're REALLY not the guy who will teach
guys like me what's good and what's wrong!)

One last note: stop using your CapsLock key, you sound like a stupid K00l WaReZ
K-RaD D00D.

Sincerly,

Well, you base yourself on very few informations I guess. That's right, some

All the best coders, gfx men and musicians are in. You really think it's

Well i'm sorry to say this but 514 groups are lame per se(inherently). We
simply do not have the suppliers and/or distributors anymore (in the latter
case) to make a strong showing. Of course anybody can make some fancy ANSI
Doodles or some viruses like FiS used to...
     Also, it's pretty lame just to leave automessages saying Hits is coming or
whatever...I mean do something, release something. Is Dr Debug a member?

Was several of you guys bugged me for a PBX. I got an annoying one I don't use,
its fairly new, but damn annoying to use, I'll explian... The PBX is

514.845.0362,,,,,5050,9,1+XXX-XXX-XXXX

It calls overseas USA, etc... BUT: the hours are like this, Its on at 7:00PM-
to 7:00AM on the weekends its 24hrs. But don't call during the morning from
Monday-Friday... or else a Girl will pick up the phone! Call after 7:00pm. Also
Sometimes its off, and the second day its on... Wierd??? Like every second day
it may just always ring... and the next its cool... So don't think it got
killed... The PBX is cool... Its fairly new...

Thank you to....

Yeah, thanks for your point of view, but we're not some kind of crackers you
know, we only do utilities and Demos so we do not need any suppliers, know what
I mean?

For the rest, I must admit that most of the old other 514 groups were lame as
you said (but as you can see, they weren't really serious and there was no
exceptionnal coders/musicians/graphists, etc.. They were only ANSI groups.)

Nope about Debug, he left the scene for a long time ago you know, I guess
you'll be able to see some stuff from us real soon (as soon as Snib' get his
board up).

BloodMATRiX / [HiTS]

Oh yeah, by the way, we've NOT yet announced HiTS, someone did but I don't know
who so we've got nothing to release before but its comming.

 Ouch. Just imagine for a second anybody else getting their house and valuables
destroyed... And them WITHOUT being doctors... your life economies crumbled
down, all the things you struggled for crushed...

 Bush didn't do much about it. He was too busy trying to boost his image over
in Somalia. Instead, it is Vermonters' generosity that helped out these
peoples: they sent electronic appliances, toys, food, clothes, everything.

 Bush is OUT.

 Arf, arf, arf.

 Well, well. Look who's whining like a little baby.

 Now that you put me to it, let me set you straight: you and ROCK STEADY have a
VERY serious problem. Who the FUCK do you think you guys are? I mean, just look
at what you guys write to all the people you see: unless they hack, phreak or
can sign FLT or something next to their names, they're K-Rad. Sounds like you
are projecting on others your very own failure.

 Only one comment I can make on this: STEREOTYPE and signle-mindedness, know
what this means? Coming from an ex-[NuKE] kid, it's pretty displaced. I mean,
I've watched you throughout the groups I've been in (DNA, [Nd] now [HiTS]), and
all you've done for the last three years, is degenerate from an intelligent
individual into a selfish, paranoiac, nervous wreck.

> known, look at the k-rad spelling with the small cased 'i'. Listen guys, ge
> clue. Your group probably sucks, and it will most certainly die within the

 Proofs of what you are saying, please? You know the golden rule of modern
understanding? "When you don't know what you're talking about, SHUT THE FUCK
UP". Now, for the fact that we suck, well with Snibble (ex-THG), Holy Avenger
([Nd] main coder) and me (also known as Silent Transition/[Nd] to a few other
respectable persons), I don't really think that we suck or that we are going to
die tomorrow.

 Now, you might be jealous that you failed to keep in a straight line. But if
all you can do is jerk others with it and fool around, then you have gone lower

than I ever thought somebody like you would.
> month... Give it up, bunch of lame assholes. Here, join my group. ANSiD00DE
> Haha, you should fit right in.

 Well. Ever thought about some assistance, in controlling your bestial sexual
pulsions? It's not because being an ansi artist is your deepest secret fantasy
that you have the right to bug us with it.

 Now. I thought you were cool, and brilliant. Seems like you really can't judge
a book by it's cover.

 Next time you wanna bash on somebody, look at yourself in a mirror. You might
just think again.

 Debug is DEAD. Do something? Sure. Just know where to look and grab
FMPATCH.ZIP. That'll zip up a few loudmouths.

 And if your opinion of 514 REALLY IS that low, then it's true, the demo/utils

Ahh, so you admit it? HiTS has done nothing. I'm not surprised. Basically this
is just some lame excuse to put some cool acronymn in back of your alias. Look
at you, not one of you can deal without it. As for *my* stupid type of
software, well do you have any idea what I do? I don't program viruses if
that's what you think. I, unlike many of you, have a life and cannot spend
hours programming some lame little demo, so I can write my name 20 times in te
credits. You'll end up like evry other 514 group in the last year, dead. Just
like the groups GMA, AiDS, Fusion... The list goes on.

Ok, Snibble, let me tell you this as nicely as I can: YOU'RE THE BIGGEST LOSER
OF THEM ALL! There, that should do it. You're the biggest egomaniac I have ever
seen. And I think a few people have told you about this before. I can't believe
than when I look at one of your demos, all I see is the word "Snibble" all over
the place. We already know you coded the damn thing, why try and pressure us
into loving you. For me it just made the thing incredibly annoying and I just
hit ESC after I had seen Snibble this and Snibble that for the 6th time. And
what's with your board? Why do you poll such a lame net? Sk8Net, such crap. Oh,
it's because I was on your board, even though you deleted my account, I made
another one... I'll let you try and figure out who it was. Back to sk8net, all
it is is some PCboard piece of shit, and your board must surely come in last as
far as quality posts go. Anyways, I'm sick of talking to you, reply to this,
and I'll hit you again.

Listen XRay, I don't have to reply to that crap you just posted, but I just got
a whole bunch of new insults, so I'm going to. First off, why did you change
alias again? Are you some kind of schytzophrenic? Does it excite you when
people try and figure out who the hell you are? Or is it because someone
figured out that you were a homosexual, and you want to hide that? Maybe that's
why you dropped out for a few months, you had to recover from that operation
you had. You know, the one where they removed the shreds of wood from your
asshole. Maybe you should of told BloodMATRiX to use an aluminium bat instead
of the old wooden one he used to hump is pet pig with. I guess you can't easily
sit down now? It's always hard when you have to apply some kind of lotion in
the depths of your bleeding anus. Of course, you're probably used to beeding
assholes, since BloodMATRiX often uses  his brand new dildo, his dick being to
small to make you feel anything. Now, on the issue of me being an ex-nuke
member, that may be so, but you must notice I quit due to temporary differences
with some other members. I, on the other hand, do not go out and form some
groups called [ZiTS] just to make me look cool for about 2 months. How can you
possibly compare nuke with [TiTS]? NuKE made something of itself, it travelled
around the continent, and even to Europe and Australia, and I am damn proud to
have participated in some of it. Don't believe me? Well just look at the
current nuke sites, and the nuke net. And nuke is still kicking, all because of
a guy like rock steady, so I would watch your mouth, or he might join in and
take you down. Also, the truth of the matter is, is that my board and me are
more helpful to 514 than you will ever be. Oh, sure, I don't have a little
[ZiTS] after my name, but I am part of VAS, a textfile group that has released
over 85 issues, and that has more power than you will ever have. Just call up
Live Wire, and download the latest, and you will see my name and board on
there. Live Wire: 313-464-1470. You can use that PBX Rock Steady posted, seeing
as it is probably the only way you can call long ditance you ignorant sack of
shit. As for the h/p question, well compare your [TiTS] group and anything h/p.
All you do is have neet0 little c0l0ry things moving around, where as h/p
actually contributes something. h/p is knowledge, and knowledge is power. That
is why I could most probably make your *real* life a living hell, even though
you probably don't have a life for me to ruin. What use are you? What do you
contribute to the telecom world? A drawing that scrolls? Oh, I'm impressed. The
truth is that you're a worthless sack of shit that will never amount to
anything. You just take up space. Why don't you do us all a favor and kill
yourself now. End your miserable life and destroy yourself. At least trash your
modem and leave us alone. Oh, but I forgot, the modem IS your life. You do it
all the time, that's when BloodMATRiX isn't humping your ass. So, please, do
it. Kill yourself. What use are you. If you were to dissapear tommorow, would
anyone care? Do you think people would be posting "To bad XRay is gone!!!
[ZiTS] was such a good group!". Take another guess, people would be posting
"XRay? Who? [ZiTS]? What? Who gives a shit?". Yes that's right, useless. SO
before you reply to this, think it over, because I can get much worse, and it's
no loss off my head.

Ok, you want to go? Well here I am, dust off the silver. You want a private
war? No problem, I can destroy you even more since I don't have the rest of
your HiTS friends butting in. So, you think you can "nuke" me? Interresting
choice of words, I guess you still remember NuKE as being the ONLY 514 group
that ever made an impact. Even though I quit, it sure is better than your ego
inflating acronymn that you get to stick after your lame handle. Yes, that's
right, look at the k-rad elite spelling: "BloodMATRiX". Did you put the MATRiX
in caps so you could put that small cased 'i' in it? Do you think this makes
you look better? Does it please you to rob someone elses idea and abuse it for
yourself? Here, look, MECHANiX! I'm elite to, I can use a 'i'! Oh, but I
forgot, to be elite like you I have to be in some k-rad group that doesn't do
shit and has some stupid definition attached. So, here: MECHANiX [TiTS]! Happy?
DOes this make as cool as you? Anyways, I'm tired of you, I will destroy you
some other time. Wanted my board number? 738-2105. Have fun with it, I might
even let you on to let some of my users have a go at you, it's always more fun
when we're more than one. I guess you should call some of your little TiTS
frineds to come and help you, or they to busy? Maybe they are to busy humping
themselves in front of those .GL animations you download off your elite art
boards. Maybe they cummed on the keyboard, and now all the keys are stuck so
they can't type. Or maybe they cummed down there own throats (most being
contorsionnists) and they dried there airway shut, and died. Or even more
probable is that you have no friends and that are calling boards under many
aliases. Maybe the group is only one person: you, and perhaps two or three of
your imaginary boyfriends, that you fantatsize sucking each night. So, before I
fucking cremate you like the rodent that you are, take your lame little group,
and stick to your lame little art boards, and stay out of my way, or I *will*
get rid of you, and you will have to change aliases once again, maybe to
something even more elite, like iNSiPiD iDiOT! Lot's of 'i's in that one,
should make you the k00lest d00d in 514. Later fool.

And now, there's my answer to him:

Wow, how intelligent you can be when you really want to! Is that the only
answer you could provide me for my questions about your psychological
problems? Duh, go fuck yourself, lamer, K-Rad D00d! Is that the only way
you speak? Not really constructive you know! Do you know how to be normal,
I mean stop being that arrogant and type like an average people. For once,
I beg you to stop your little ego-trip and be wize (can you do that??)

For sure, I've not taken your insult personally, I guess you were looking
at a mirror when you were typing...

So, there's the facts: Why are you doing us all this shit? Are you mad
because of something? You know that we've not done anything yet so the
only thing I can say is stand aside and wait a few weeks to see what's
going to happend. By acting like this, you only help us to continue what
we're doing you know. If you really want us dead, tell us why now, and
clearly if possible (using simple, normal vocabulary okay?).

I'm not giving you any shit as you can see, and there's some more: we're
not Elites or lamers (we hate those two nonsense words) nor K-rads, we are
SERIOUS programmers wanting to have fun developping intelligent softwares
for the interested. If you don't agree with this policy, just shut up your
mouth and let us live. We know what we're doing. By the way, I've been on
your board, but I guess you'll not be nice enough to validate me, so let's
finish it here!

And about Nuke? I've got nothing to say about them, for all the time I've
been on the scene, I've NEVER seen anything INTERESTING from them!

Mechanix, Mechanix, Mîchàüix, hey, that's you! And now, who's K-Rad here?
That's not the way YOU typed it? (Ohhh, sorry, I mistyped it, there is a
few more K-Rad in your original one). So, you're not likely to be the one
telling us that we're K-Rad uh?

Finally, it also seem that you're in need of sex (say it, it won't hurt you
know!). Could someone over here help him with that? I guess not, there is
no Homosexuals around here except you, well, it seems that you must live
with it pal!

Hey, what's about the rest? Just put it in your ass, it seems that you
might have some empty place to fill in it uh? And about your little
threats, put them in your ass also, I won't let you have the last word on
this for anything on earth!

Ok, so you want more? Fine, I'll waste another 30 minutes blowing you away.
First off, I see you changed your name spelling. Just to ashamed now aren't
you? As for my old spelling (BTW, it was Mî›H’ï!X), there is a very big
difference. I did it because I wanted to, plus it was original. The only thing
you did is put the lame little 'i' in there, so you could copy others you so
admire. Here: iCE, ACiD, ZiTS, FiS, MiRAGE, FiRM, GRiM... The list is endless,
and let's not forget ANSi, which is totally insane. How about ASCii, or UNiX?
Why not? It would look so good. As for me not letting you on my board, well
all I saw from you was your name, and about 40 <CR>s to get to the end of the
?-nnaire. Proving once again you know absolutely nothing. And don't tell me you
didn't try to fill it out, because I know that you couldn't. Here's a
challenge. If you can fill it out in the next 10 days, I'll post an apology
here. I'll even call you voice to apologise. I know it's 646-5510 by the way.
Also, nice try with the fag jokes, it's not very imaginative to basically
repeat what I just threw in your face. As for needing sex, well I'll leave that
one up to your wonderful imagination. SO, now to answer your question, as to
why I am doing this, well I can't stand seeing one-liners, rumors,
auto-messages and posts saying how good [ZiTS] is, and how it will rule 514.
The truth is [TiTS] is nothing, and I state my word on the fact that it will
never amount to anything. If you think that it will, then I think you hit
yourself on the head or something. Maybe your little friend XRay banged your
head in the brick wall while he was humping you in the alley. Maybe you should
put a construction helmet on, a geeky one, like the one from that guy in the
Village People, which is probably your favorite music group. Oh, sorry, I
forgot. Your cool musicians in [ZiTS] are your favorite group. I bet you
fantasize about sucking them all day long. You must grab your crotch all day in
school. Or do you not go to school? Education to much to handle for your little
brain? Think you might actually amount to something usefull in life? Guess so,
that's why you pursue this endless quest to become a useless parasite. Frankly,
you disgust me. If you want to program, by all means do it. But don't go
forming some lame group around it. This is why 514 sucks so much, because of
idiots like you who form lame groups like [ZiTS]. Do you think people respect
you? Hell no! They think of you as a bunch of kids who have such a lack of
self-esteem that they need to bunch together and hide behind an acronymn. As
for me writting like "k00l, and k-rad", well if you don't understand it, you
really missed the bowl. Not only did you miss the toilet bowl, but you fell on
the floor and busted your tailbone. I wrote a few words like that for the same
reason I write HDK like that, and that is to make fun of you idiots (or should
I say iDiOTZ) who really think it's cool. Assholes, like (real spelling)
PsyCHiC DEmoN and BloodMATRiX. Fools who go on boards and type incompetent
messages like: "Hey!!! D00DEZ!$%$!!! WhEN Is WinG KoMMAnDER 2 KomINg
0Ut!?!!?!?" or "I nEeD a PbX KraCKED DooDEZZZ!!~~!?!?!". So if you want to
continue this, by all means go for it. I will keep capturing your lame texts.
By the way, they are all going in the next issue of VAS digest, so make them
interresting. I can also promise you I will have the last word on this, even if
it means getting you on a 15 port alliance and recording it while I have 14
people blow you out of the sky. I am determined to reveal you and [ZiTS] for
the useless piece of shit it really is, and why am I doing this? Well I'm
actually doing it for everyone in 514. I am determined to make this npa better
quality, and if that means getting rid of you, then so be it.
