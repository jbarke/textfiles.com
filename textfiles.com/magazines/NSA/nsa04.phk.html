  Welcome to National Security Anarchists Issue 4.  Yes we at NSA do admit this 
  Issue has taken some time since our previous releases.  Not to worry NSA is 
  still in existence and we shall continue always.  Why for the delay, Muds. 
  Trust me, Muds eats Hackers.  If you are planning to play muds, Rest assured 
  that you best say bye bye to your Hacking Career.  As I type this 
  Introduction, Dead Addict is blabbing "Dick Van Dyke, Starring Dick Van 
  Dyke".  And has raised an interesting question.  Why do these old shows have 
  separate beds for the Married Coupled.  And also these Married Couples have 
  Children?!? 
 
  Many of you have raised a point that is obvious.  We copy our material from 
  books/trash/manuals.  Yes we do and we always have admitted it.  Our Motto 
  states "Plagiarism is the Basis of Creativity".  Why do we copy straight from 
  the manuals/trash?  Simple!  The best source of Information is from the 
  Source. Here is a simple analogy to explain it even more.  Information is a 
  juicy Steak. And Most groups take this information and reword it.  Thus this 
  is Second Hand teaching, and plus you are learning what they learned. 
  Therefore that is in comparison to chewing up a steak and feeding you 
  tasteless bits.  Now we at NSA give you that Steak, unchewed, unprocessed, so 
  you to can enjoy that same flavor that we experience when examining this 
  material. 
 
  Also many of our readers have made several interesting ideas and comments for 
  the newsletter.  Now The Serious Side of Hacking is available in this 
  Newsletter.  What is The Serious Side of Hacking, well let I'll let Dead 
  Addict explain his section. 
 
  NSA has released SlimJim Version 1.0 into the Hack/Phreak world.  SlimJim is 
  a Unix Utility for MS/DOS machines.  SlimJim slims those large password files 
  and makes them smaller.  Plus SlimJim is very fast even on IBM XT compatible 
  computers, and saves you space at the same time.  SlimJim can be found on 
  various Hack/Phreak boards. 
 
  Soon Silicon Slave Version 2.0 will be released.  Yes, another Hack/Phreak 
  utility from NSA.  Silicon Slave is a collection of common Hack/Phreak 
  utilities incorporated into one program.  Details will be released later.

  Project 358 continued to explore video techniques in areas of copyright 
  protection, scrambling, and video storage.  Emphasis was placed on 
  development of hardware and software to demonstrate the feasibility of 
  network-based copyright protection.  Figure 358-1 depicts VCS functional 
  blocks.  The copyright protection scheme encrypts video material by 
  scrambling each vertical field and embedding program serial number, field 
  number, and error correction codes in one horizontal line of the vertical 
  blanking interval (VBI).  Public domain encryption techniques are used to 
  recover 15-bit pseudo-random descrambling codes.  Decryption requires the 
  keys(s) provided by a remote database, accessed through a low-speed 
  communication link (telephone network).  This allows viewing control and 
  revenue collection by intelligence in the remote database, but facilitates 
  copying and distribution of protected material. 
 
  The encryption scheme has two levels, one for protection of video 
  descrambling codes embedded in the VBI, and one for protection of messages 
  between the home and the remote database.  The encryption technique assumes 
  the potential pirate knows the encryption algorithm and demonstrates years of 
  work time to decrypt protected material without database-controlled keys. 
  The copyright protection scheme provides high-integrity protection of video 
  material until the key(s) is released, which provides security for live 
  broadcast and/or the recording and distribution phase of video cassettes. 
  While there are various schemes for protecting decrypted material from 
  copying during viewing, including locating the decryption function inside a 
  special TV or video monitor, none of the schemes provides significant 
  protection from the sophisticated pirate.

  This project supports the implementation of a small field-deployable viewing 
  control-copyright protection system.  Results will be used as building blocks 
  to define a viewing control field demonstration for the Cerritos ][ testbed. 
 
  The past year has seen the development for VCS of MCU software that is 
modular 
  for flexibility during further development, yet does not exhaust the capacity 
  of the Motorola 6805 microcontroller and is able to operate within the bounds 
  of visual field time.  VCS processing in the microcontroller of the Home Unit 
  is now able to serve three levels of message encryption and apply up to five 
  scrambling keys to each video program.  It can also handle midtape video 
  start, viewing time control, and session cancellation.  Developments of 
  message overlays and application of "anti-pirate" copy signatures are now 
  under way and are scheduled for completion in the 1991's. 
 
  A significant effort during 1990 was the design and implementation of a 
  unique scheme for generating robust scrambling codes that preserve the 
  smoothness of the presentation.  The method is based upon encryption of 
  successive field numbers.  It produces scrambling codes that are uniformly 
  distributed and unpredictable, hence largely pirate-proof, yet can be easily 
  recovered by the system when videotape flaws prevent reading of field numbers 
  from the tape itself. 
 
  Six patents were filed on viewing control system techniques during the year. 
 
  Preliminary meeting were held with three studios, one TV manufacturer, and 
  one anti-taping technology company.  A presentation was also made to the T3 
  Standards Committee. 
 
  This project also supports activities relating to standards, including 
  attendance at T1Y1 and HDTV groups, as well as the EIA Multiport Receiver 
  Group.  A North American standard for compressing digitized video is under 
  active investigation by the T1Y1.1 Experts Group on DS3 TV.  GTE Laboratories 
  had increased activity in this field by attending the meetings held by the 
  Experts Group.  These meetings are usually attended by representatives of the 
  T1Q5.5 Experts Group who are concerned with performance standards for 
  digitized video transmission and represent the broadcasters and others.

  Below is a capture from HAYES, it is from the President of Hayes speaking on 
  the future of ISDN. Hey, folks this is the future so it would be to your 
  advantage to at least know whats going on. 
 
 "Waiting for ISDN to Happen..." 
 
  That phrase is a phrase that is seen often -- in magazines we read -- in 
  speeches we hear or in meetings we attend.   "When will ISDN happen?"  Our 
  market and product planning departments ask.  Our customers ask.   The 
  analysts and media make their predictions. 
 
  In the last two years, the magazine articles and speeches are changing: 
  something has happened.  In the last year people are now questioning 
 
 "WILL ISDN ever happen?" 
 
  As for the question,  "Will ISDN ever happen?", we all know the answer is 
  yes.  ISDN will happen and ISDN is happening.  The countries in North America 
  cannot afford to allow our communications services to be incompatible or 
  non-competitive with communications services used by our companies' and 
  America's global competitors.  ISDN is happening in Europe and is beginning 
  in Asia and our region of the world cannot afford to be left out.  ISDN must 
  happen in North America. 
 
  But there is a perception problem and the members of our computer and 
  telecommunications industries must solve the problems that still inhibit the 
  commercialization of ISDN. 
 
  If we were to graph the public interest in ISDN, we would see a "Spike of 
  Expectation" during 1986 - 1987 -- even into 1988.  People believed that ISDN 
  would make an impact on businesses and were excited about the possibilities 
  of using this technology.  But when the expectations were not met, 
  excitement was followed by a "Valley of Disappointment."  We must begin 
  building the excitement again -- but at a realistic level of steady growth -- 
  where the public interest matches the industry's capability.   A steady 
  growth of capability over the next year or two will rebuild confidence.  We 
  must provide concrete and tangible evidence of this steady growth of ISDN 
  deployment on an ongoing basis. Keep in mind the person who has to make the 
  decision to buy the service. What makes the MIS Manager or Telecommunications 
  Manager buy the service and products that implement ISDN?  What makes them 
  convince the CIO that ISDN is worth the investment? 
 
  The COS (Corporation for Open Systems) announcement about ISDN 1 has 
  rekindled public interest and is a step in the right direction, but we and 
  all of our colleagues in the industry must remove the real and perceived 
  barriers to successful commercialization. 
 
  Part of the problem that caused the "Valley of Disappointment" comes simply 
  from the concept of time in the computer industry being so different from the 
  concept of time in the telecommunications industry. 
 
  The computer industry:  predominantly data oriented -- and not regulated. 
  People expect computer technology to change rapidly and it usually does. 
  It is much easier for the computer industry to develop new products because 
  they do not face the barriers that the telecommunications industry faces. 
 
  Look at local area networking.  It took several years but it was fairly easy 
  for the computer industry to bring that technology into businesses.  LANs 
  were  market and technology-driven applications that faced no regulatory 
  barriers. 
 
  The telephone industry, on the other hand, is a much older industry that is 
  affected by a number of restraints which throttle change: compatibility with 
  the existing network and the federal and state regulatory barriers -- just to 
  name two. 
 
  The telephone industry's roots are with voice services to residential 
  customers even though data traffic is rapidly growing.   There is less 
  understanding of data services and very little understanding of the 
  integration of voice and data by most employees in North American telephone 
  companies. 
 
  So the two different cultures must meet.  And ISDN needs to bring the merger 
  of these two industries together very quickly.  ISDN is causing a tighter 
  coupling, tighter integration -- particularly with the integration of voice 
  and data -- making computers and telecommunications come together faster. 
 
  But as we all know -- there are barriers we face.  In March 1988, I gave a 
  speech for an ISDN User's Group here in Atlanta on "Removing the Barriers to 
  ISDN."  I am sure that many of you have heard or have made a similar speech: 
  All of us must work to overcome the barriers, from those in the industry who 
  provide the service and equipment to the customers who use the service and 
  buy the products.   It is our job to motivate the customers. 
 
  ISDN is being limited.  Limited by service availability, the regulatory 
  environment, tariffs, incompatibility between products, complexity of 
  provisioning and installation, and knowledge about deployment -- just to name 
  a few of the barriers.  Deployment plans and capital budget are crucial 
  elements that throttle the retooling of the telephone company workforce. 
 
  Service providers must rethink the way they develop and deploy technology. 
  If they want to play an increasing role in the rapidly growing data market, 
  the telephone companies will learn to think of central offices as  "data 
  centers." 
 
  CPE vendors must evaluate and revise the way they develop and provide 
  equipment to users,  as well as the way the applications get implemented to 
  use the service. 
 
  And as we begin to break down these barriers we must focus on our customers' 
  needs, keeping in mind the person who has to make the decision to buy the 
  service and equipment.  We must offer the service and products that make 
  communications more efficient and  cost effective,  and that give the user a 
  competitive advantage in his business. 
 
  But, how can we expect a customer to implement ISDN today?   We make it 
  difficult for the MIS Manager or Telecommunications Manager to buy the 
  service and our products.  An MIS Director cannot plan a nation-wide or 
  global network for their company because he cannot easily determine where 
  service is available now -- and more importantly when service will be 
  deployed during his planning horizon. And, there is no direct single place to 
  go to find the answer.  Very few user companies are US-based only.  And 
  certainly very few companies are based only in one service area.   So an MIS 
  Director is faced with going to a multitude of sources to collect data just 
  to evaluate if ISDN is a viable technology for an important application and 
  no one can tell him where to find all the needed information. 
 
  People in the communications business must communicate and share information. 
  With the two industries working together we can leverage our technical 
  expertise to benefit our customers. 
 
  ISDN is technically successful and working today even though improvements 
  will be made as standards evolve.  What is needed now is the ability for 
  cooperative competition to allow the successful commercialization in the 
  North American markets.  Customer needs can be met by cooperative behavior 
  between competitors which will remove real or perceived barriers that the 
  customer faces. 
 
  The Japanese understand cooperative competition.  Look at the development of 
  the VHS tape player.  The modem industry understands cooperative competition. 
  The development of CCITT V.42bis is an example of cooperative competition, 
  where companies worked together to offer the public the best technical 
  solution for compression in modems. 
 
  It is time to ask our legal departments how we can work together rather than 
  allowing them to say that we can't.  There are areas such as standards, 
  sharing information with customers, and removing the barriers where we can 
  legally work together without crossing the line into areas where we compete 
  for business. 
 
  ISDN commercialization takes a great deal of team work from all of us: 
  Service Providers; Switch Vendors; CPE Vendors; Applications Developers; 
  Resellers.  And, we must always be focusing on the end user and their needs. 
  Our goal as an industry should be to provide total customer satisfaction -- 
  which will mean offering a range of solutions. 
 
  Some of the visionary people in the two industries believe that fiber optics 
  and broadband ISDN are the future.  Basic Rate Access (BRA) and Primary Rate 
  Access (PRA) have their places.  BRA can offer a range of applications that 
  can create the desktop telecomputing environment that starts the shift from 
  the paper-based office to one that is electronically-based. 
 
  Today the Xerox copier and the fax machine support the paper-based office. 
  Basic Rate ISDN is the technology which can initiate a wide-area change in 
  multiple locations and to electronic-based communications. 
 
  Trends show that businesses are changing.    They need to be more competitive 
  in the global marketplace.  They require a shorter cycle time from decision 
  making to implementation and they can no longer act as a single unit.  A 
  business must work together with multiple enterprises. ISDN can be a major 
  catalyst that transforms businesses today and brings people into the 
  equation. 
 
  I believe that the integrated services and performance of ISDN will 
  fundamentally change the way people and businesses communicate.  ISDN is not 
  a faster modem.  It is not a "nicer" telephone.  It is not easier wide-area, 
  dial-up switched 56K digital circuit and packet communications. It is the 
  combination of these things offered economically, worldwide, that are the 
  ingredients for an "office revolution" and a new market for all of our 
  industries. 
 
  ISDN can fuel the transition to an electronically-based office. Things are 
  happening in the computer industry -- large screen workstations from 
  companies such as Sun, HP, DEC, Apple and IBM.  Applications like IBM Office 
  Vision, AT&T's Rhapsody, and Lotus Notes.   Workstations are no longer for 
  "data" processing -- they are for information processing and with the 
  integration of voice and data,  information processing can be brought to a 
  new level of interaction between the people who make decisions and take 
  action based on the information. 
 
  I am sure when the copier was first developed, no one imagined how businesses 
  would change -- with the ability of the printing press at their immediate 
  disposal.  We in the ISDN industry can just begin to think about what can 
  happen with true multimedia integration.  With voice and data integration, 
  people will be able to work on documents together -- no matter where they are 
  located. 
 
  Much of my company's focus has been on developing products that provide the 
  platform for good integration of voice and data --- not just products for 
  voice -- or products for data. 
 
  And, we realize the importance of applications developers, the people who 
  understand how work is done in an insurance company, a transportation 
  company, a retailer, or manufacturing company.  These are the people that 
  have to drive the implementation of applications for the end user and can 
  assist us in exploring the integration of voice and data. We need those 
  people who understand the way businesses work to develop the applications 
  needed by real users who don't yet know how multimedia integration can change 
  their ability to get work done. 
 
  We have developed PC adapters for the computer to work with the service and 
  we have focused on the program interfaces (the Hayes Standard AT Command Set 
  for ISDN and the Hayes ISDNBIOS).  These interfaces give applications 
  developers a platform to write their programs and provide the connection 
  between the CPE and the computer. 
 
  We strongly believe that it is the applications that will make customers want 
  to use any  service.   ISDN will be successfully implemented only when our 
  customers perceive it as faster and better, and offering improved price 
  performance and giving them some real advantage over their existing telecom 
  and datacom solutions.  ISDN must allow our customers to meet their needs of 
  today but also allow them to take a large step forward in doing difficult 
  tasks more easily.  ISDN must provide reasonably priced applications that are 
  not readily available today with alternative or bypass communications 
  solutions. 
 
  Our challenge is to bring our two industries together and to make ISDN 
  happen.  To remove the barriers.  Don't just create another spike of 
  expectation and excitement. 
 
  This afternoon the computer industry has an incredible opportunity  -- the 
  opportunity to work together with the telecommunications industry to make 
  ISDN happen.  For CPE vendors, applications developers, switch manufacturers 
  and telecommunications service providers to work together to launch a new 
  technology which will bring competitive advantage to our North American 
  customers, and fulfill user needs for easily accessed, integrated, efficient, 
  and cost effective integrated communications. 
 
  A simple concept:  customers and suppliers working together letting each 
  other know what they need to make something happen. 
 
  Bellcore has given both industries this workshop to begin the talks and to 
  open the lines of discussion between the two industries. And, going forward, 
  they will continue to play this role through their Resource Personnel. 
 
  Together the two industries can make ISDN a reality. 
 
  Just as we heard for six or seven years "This is the year of the LAN" 
  announced by our or another of the LAN company's CEO's, there were six or 
  seven years of the LAN leading to the success we see today. Today's  LAN is 
  an  important business tool. 
 
  If we grasp the opportunity Bellcore has given the industry here today on top 
  of all that is already being done throughout the industry, then surely we 
  will be able to look back and say 1991 was the first year we claim "This is 
  the year of ISDN."

  Research in Project 426 focused on areas of human speech understanding and 
  cognitive psychology that are critical to introducing automation in telephone 
  operations, and to designing effective human-computer interfaces.  In 
  addition, substantial support was provided to GTE Airfone, and research was 
  also directed at understanding how factors associated with wireless 
  communication (e.g., time delays, low-bit-rate speech coders, various channel 
  impairments) can influence conversations. 
 
  In 1990, Project 426 continued to support Project 533 (Application of 
  Automatic Speech Recognition to Telephone Operations) by providing 
  information on the characteristics of calls to Customer Service Order Centers 
  (CSOCs).  Project staff completed analysis of a large set of conversations 
  have been cataloged on a variety of dimensions.  Based on the information in 
  the database, a report was prepared on automating customer service contacts 
  by means of computer-based speech recognition.  In addition, work has started 
  on characterizing vocabulary in different types of conversations (e.g., 
  orders to install versus disconnect service) via automatic indexing and 
  cluster analysis. 
 
  To support detailed analysis of these recorded conversations, the VAX speech 
  editor was rewritten using a C++ style object-oriented user interface.  A 
  study to analyze the timing of question-answer sequences between CSOC 
  representatives and customers is now under way. 
 
  The long-term issues pertinent to the development of speech-based automated 
  systems were addressed in a paper presented at an international conference. 
  Topics discussed included methods for measuring the complexity of dialogue, 
  convergence (the process by which conversant adopt aspect of each others 
  speech), and the use of dialogue control acts (extra conversational steps 
  that ensure that the conversation proceeds smoothly). 
 
  Project staff also completed a report on an experiment performed in 1989 that 
  was designed to investigate the effects of attentional constraints on the 
  processing of natural and synthetic speech. 
 
  In 1990, work continued on evaluating conversations recorded under controlled 
  conditions that simulated one or more factors found in mobile 
  telecommunication systems.  A new test procedure designed in 1989 was 
  refined, and measurement techniques were developed.  Using this new 
procedure, 
  an experiment to investigate conversation dynamics over delay circuits with 
  600 and 1200 ms lags was completed.  Resolving the delay question is an 
  important first step in the project's investigations of conversation dynamics 
  in wireless channels because speech-compression techniques can introduce a 
  delay on the order of 150 ms (delays due to switching or transmission may add 
  significantly to this figure).  The project team is now in the process of 
  testing subjects in a second study that includes speech coder/bit error 
  conditions using the two-way ASET board developed by the Speech Technology 
  Group. 
 
  Work in support of the second-generation Airfone system focused on the design 
  and operation of Seatfone ][.  In 1990, project staff completed a series of 
  experiments and reports, including a study on user preference for membrane 
  keypads, a study of dialing performance using membrane keypads under 
  different feedback conditions (both auditory and visual), an assessment of a 
  new Seatfone handset, detailed comments and suggestions on a set of flow 
  charts intended to illustrate the call-sequence logic of Seatfone ][, and a 
  report on the quality of new speech prompts.  In addition, work has now 
  started on a comprehensive evaluation of the Seatfone ][ design using a 
  prototype developed by Airfone and ASIC Designs, and on the preparation of 
  detailed user-interface specifications.

  This Phile is hopefully the first in a series of Philes on VMB's.  This is 
  also dedicated to Night Stalker (.aka. Flt 255 of (313) in memory of..) , and

  I would like to add that all this information contained here within is not 
  intended to cause, direct or in any means relate to any illegal activities. I 
  can also say the following is true. 
 
  Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1030, (Revised  1986) gives the 
  Secret Service, among other Federal law enforcement  agencies, the right to 
  investigate fraud and related activities in connection with "Federal-Interest 
  computers." 
 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  - The above is true and the information below is for educational purposes - 
  -            only. Plus the information should be free to all!            - 
  =========================================================================== 
  8.8.91          VMB Number 1.00    A Info Series on 800.xxx.6245 MAIL Scans 
  =========================================================================== 
 
  The purpose of this Phile was to Scan the 800.xxx6245, where xxx is all the 
  possible prefixes. 6245 represents MAIL on DMTF fones. So I realized that 
many 
  people would take the time to check out this sub-prefix, 6245. I have done 
  all the initial information scanning and did not try to invade these systems. 
  I hope this information will help you to better understand VMB's. Heck if you 
  don't know what a VMB is you should do a little research. I believe LOL #10 
or 
  12 is on VMB's. I will however cover some basics. 
 
  VMB - stands for Voice Mail(Message) Box, this is a voice message system, 
        that allows messages, call transfers. ect. - Most work on a 3 or 4 
        digit mail box and an associated password to access that box. 
 
  The problem is alot of systems are getting security wacko and have Password, 
  then Box or 8 digit boxes and 8 digits Passwords combos. This phile is not 
  meant for you to hack these numbers but just as an informational source. As 
  an Anarchist or CyberPhreak you can appreciate the wealth of this 
  information. These Corporations generally do not take the time to listen. I 
  really doubt if they even use there VMB's, however if you have a gripe leave 
  a message to those concerned.

     [A] FH (Fuckin Hacker) 2.0  - Modifications and Setups that were used. 
 
         [1] Main Menu , Type D for Utilities 
         [2] Type A for Config Modem 
 
             Suggest putting ATL0 or ATL1 in your Modem Initialization string 
             to turn the speaker low. 
 
               [D] PBX Dialing - Turn to YES 
               [E] Outgoing Digit - Set to 1800 
               [I] Speaker - ON 
 
         [3] Go to the Target and Valid files and leave only one entry, you can 
             delete all the entries, it will leave one that is set at default 
             values. 
 
         [4] Go next to EDIT EXTENDERS 
 
             Remember this is a VMB run so you need no extenders, but will Add 
             new ones. Choose ADD. 
 
               [A] None leave blank 
               [B] None leave blank - The PBX option in the config modem takes 
                care of the outdial digits. 
               [C] Leave at Local 
 
               [D] Adjust to your board or leave as defaults. 
               [E] Adjust to your board or leave as defaults 
               [F] leave off 
               [G] Answer Delay - set to 0 
               [H] Target Delay - set to 35 or more 
               [I] 0 
               [J] Code First - YES 
               [K] Sequential - I use sequential so I can watch when the cycle 
                                ends and ESC back and flag ones that completed 
                                off or read just the scan to the next prefix 
                                series. 
 
               [L] Code Length - 7 
               [M] Code Template - ##abbbb  where ## is the Digit Cycle, a is 
                                   the change cycle and bbbb in this case was 
                                   6245. (Mail). I use a random scan search for 
                                   example I know that the first two digits of 
                                   a prefix cannot be 1 or 2 and the third 
                                   cannot be 0, so I set up my ADDs in a random 
                                   number sequence to cover the numbers from 2 
                                   to 9, ie. 8,2,9,5,7,3,6,4 so the first 
                                   template is 82X6245 then 22X6245 then 
                                   92X6245. The X is important since this is 
                                   what changes from scan to scan. FH doesn't 
                                   go in order and may hit an code sequence two 
                                   or three times so you may hit an prefix once 
                                   every 15 dials. 
 
               [N] Starting Code - ##abbbb where # is your starting number ie 
                   82, a is always 1 on the initial pass and increases, bbbb in 
                   this case is 6245. 
 
               All other values I leave at default, once I have added the 
               prefixes, I go to the extender flagging and flag them all. 
 
          [5] Flag Extenders - flag all your additions 
          [6] ESC and start HACKING from the main menu. I may add that I 
              created a batch file that would random hack and wait for 5 - 15 
              minutes both ways. Do not spend 8 hours or even more than 30 
              minutes Scanning even if you have alot of Ports, running. 
 
 
    ------------------ FH VMB Hints and Thins to Watch For. --------------- 
 
     [B] Pay Attention here. Alot of people miss these hints, they will 
         save you time and will even force you to listen durin scanning. 
 
         You hear a click before the ringing, this is 99% a invalid 
         prefix, prepare to hit the SpaceBar to skip this prefix. 
 
         You here a dial tone, hey this may be a PBX, let us know! If 
         you hear some DMFT tones then another ringing, this may be a 
         Diverter. 
 
         You get a message to leave a message, Hit * or # if it 
         continues wait for a double beep. This can be a diverter or a 
         backdoor into a PBX or you can just playback the messages or 
         other stuff. 
 
         You get a Carrier, fast hit spacebar record the number. In 
         the setup I have provided FH may error out because of no Code 
         File stated. Check the Carrier later. 
 
         VMBing works best at night, after business hours, since most 
         companies have operators during the day, and you will miss 
         and piss off people during the daytime. 
 
         Be careful of the MCI/US Sprint lines, they have Level D ANI 
         and see a display of who called. If they have CA (Call 
         Accounting) then they have a record of your number on a 
         printout (Sweep Finder). 
 
         Most Passwords can be the box number or an variation, 
         for boxes try either 999,9999,1000 or 1111 these are 
         generally the default Telco administrator boxes. 
 
  These are just a few notes...Now for the Good stuff. Remember, These 
  numbers are current as of 8.8.91 so they are fresh, don't burn them 
  out. If you do get a Slave going let me know. If there are any 
  additions or comments let me know. (See end of Phile to contact me)

  Well, there's 70 VMB's for yah. These are just the .6245.'s believe me there 
  are a couple of hundred if not thousand more out there. If you get a slave 
  box, do us a favor...share your information. 
 
  This concludes the first in a series of VMB information. I hope in the future 
  to provide some more radical technical information..i.e. Interfacing VMB's 
  with PBX's and how it all works, Technical DoX on Major VMB's and maybe 
  develop a Scan Klub. Hope you have phun, but do remember if you have a Gripe 
  tell it to the President of the Company...LEAVE A MESSAGE IN THE VMB!

  That is what The Serious Side of Hacking is all about.  Poetic hackers are 
  perhaps one of the most neglected minorities in the country.  Looking on a 
  list of possible scholarships, I see "Homosexual, Blind, Black Agraphobes", 
  but no poetic hacker. Lets face it, society just ignores us.  Fellow hackers 
  just ignore us.  No more.  Now we have an entire dedicated section in the 
  most prestigious hacking newsletter (that has my name on it) ever produced. 
  Now, why me, why not our capable editor Mind Rape?  Very good question...  I 
  was going to let him write this section...  Then I heard some of his poetry. 
  I handle this section now.  (offence intended, Mind Rape).  However, this is 
  not only a poets forum, we also support many other neglected hacker topics. 
  What topics you say?  Lotsa topics....  Previously unreleased boxes, cool 
  anarchy techniques, and much, much, more. 
 
  Mind Rape wanted to call this area "Hacker Sarcasm".  I said "ikes, that 
  sucks, Mind Rape".  But we tried to keep a humoristic view about it, and 
  hopefully there will be a pinch of humor in all of this writing. 
  Where to complain if you do not like any of this: fuck you, go to hell, 
  lemme see you do better, you uncreative, unapreciative louse. (wow, that's 
  pretty cool word too - "louse") 
 
  Unclaimers, Reclaimers, Disclaimers, Recliners - I hereby claim every hacking 
  technique ever to be discussed here WORKS.  I don't know what the word 
  RECLAIMERs means.  The only DISCLAIMER this section has is that we take no 
  responsibility for the MANY crimes we hope to encourage you, and your friends 
  to commit.  RECLINERS, great to laze around in. 
 
  Ok, kids, that looks like about it for now....  enjoy the TSSOH articles 
  contained herein (wow, what a cool word!), and Mind Rape, I sure hope to hell 
  you don't want me to write an introduction EVERY issue.  (see definition of 
  RECLINER for my reasons for this request).

                            == The INVISIBLE Box == 
            ==The first in a series of previously unreleased boxes== 
 
                                An Introduction 
 
  A friend of mine who is both an electrician and a phone technician has had no 
  contact with the computer underground, and yet has managed to design and 
  produce several incredible boxes that never have been released.  This dear 
  soul was kind enough to take me under his wing and show me some of his 
  incredible inventions.  Luckily for all of us he was not only interested in 
  saving some money (he too abhors the idea of paying for ANY phone call), but 
  had a healthy interest in anarchy as well.  The INVISIBLE box I am about to 
  describe is SO incredible it makes the blotto box look like the DONUTHIN box 
  (to be released at a later time in this series). 
 
 
  DISCLAIMER: Important! This file was DESIGNED to ENCOURAGE others to break 
              laws, commit anarchy, and create havoc.  If you have NO intention 
              of doing all of the above please do NOT read this.  I however 
              will take NO responsibility for the MANY laws I hope I to 
              encourage you to break. 
 
 
  USAGE: 
 
    Essentially this is an improved blotto box.  But the blotto box, as we know 
    was bullshit, this WORKS! (I have, um, er, friends that have told me so, I 
    would NEVER break any laws myself).  Through the use of the RS232 port on 
    your 50mhz IBM compatible we will show you how to destroy ANY, I repeat ANY 
    area code you wish to destroy.  I know this sounds incredulous but there is 
    an essential flaw in the surge protect system that is installed around the 
    country. (This system is the reason that the blotto box did not work and 
    was bullshit).  One of the incredible features that this box has is that it 
    is IMPOSSIBLE to trace with existing current technology. 
 
 
WHAT MAKES THIS BOX POSSIBLE: 
 
  The flaw with the infamous blotto box is that it tried to instantly fry the 
  area code (another flaw is that it tried to kill the area code that you were 
  IN).  The INVISIBLE box slowly builds up voltage in the remote target until 
  the required voltage is established, then discharches just enough voltage to 
  create a spike to demolish an area code. 
 
 
MATERIALS NEEDED: 
 
  Honda Generator: 
             Note: (hey, WOW, they DID get SOMETHING right on that blotto 
                   bullshit) 
    How to obtain: Rent (this costs a bit, so stay with me) 
                   Steal! (preferred method) 
 
  486 50mhz IBM Compatible: Why all this power?  One of the reasons that this 
                            has not been done before is that there is not 
                            enough speed to properly kill off area codes with a 
                            wimply 486 25mhz, so we have to use a 50mhz 
                            machine. 
             How to obtain: Again, NSA STRONGLY recommends that you steal one 
                            of these. (the chair-through-the-window-technique 
                            is suggested). 
 
 
                             !!!MOST IMPORTANT!!!! 
 
                  The National Security Anarchists Release Of 
       "Area Sucking, Smashing Heroific Osculator: Lancaster Engineered" 
 
  I know the title is a bit of a mouthful, but the writer of the program (my 
  friend I was telling you about) insisted, so NSA finally gave in, and 
  released it under that name. This program has already been released to the 
  general public, and can be found on ANY worthwhile H/P/A/C/V/K/W board in the 
  country. 
 
  The interface between the components has been explained in detail with the 
  docs to that accompany the program. (we tried to think of an acronym for the 
  program, but were at a loss). 
 
  Well I guess thats pretty much it.  I would explain how to use the program, 
  but it is SO painfully obvious once you load it in, I would feel like an 
  idiot spending precious disk space explaining it here. 
 
  NOTES: I would like to thank my friend (Lancaster) for thoughtfully 
         engineering this, and taking the time and energy to write the program 
         (he spent four LONG months doing so).  I would also like to announce 
         with pride that this program is now Windows compatible, and soon will 
         be released for various other systems depending on the hardware that 
         is currently available on some systems.  Thank you, and happy area 
         code killing.

  We at NSA, decided that World News and Telco Briefs are basicly the same idea 
  divided up into two sections.  Therefore resulting in the mixture of both, 
  Info World.  This is where one can develop a good source of knowledge of 
  Teleco/Hacker Information.  Here, one can see what new advancements have 
  taken place/problems have happened in the Teleco/Hacker World.  Also one can 
  see and theorize how Ma Bell can use her new technology to destroy us.  Even 
  if the idea is petty, but expand on that idea.  We do tell you our views so 
  that hopefully Hackers/Phreakers will develop their own, be able to create 
  their own views/theories.  To create that realization for him/herself, which 
  then creates a better understand of our Society and yourself.  Do you limit 
  your imagination...

  Pacific Bell has inked an agreement to market NEC Technologies' Centrex-based 
  station message detail recording (SMDR) and call accounting equipment to it's 
  California Centrex customers. 
 
  The additional products are expected to help make Pacific Bell's Centrex 
  offering more attractive and competitive with customer premises-based network 
  solutions. 
 
  The NEC gear, known as Centrex Telemanagement, lets telecos offer call 
  accounting, traffic management, automated directory, facilities management, 
  and equipment and feature inventory through the central office.  The 
  equipment can interface with AT&Ts 5ESS and 1AESS switches, Northern 
  Telecom's DMS-100, and NEC's own equipment, according to Susan Schneider, 
  product marketing specialist with Boxborough, Mass. based NEC Technologies.

  MCI has unveiled the platform that will bring its Virtual Private Data 
  Services (VPDS) into the future, as well as the first offering via platform: 
  a frame relay service. 
 
  At the International Communication Association show in Anaheim, California, 
  in the first week of June.  MCI unveiled plans to deploy a nationwide, 
  cell-based network platform to support next generation broadband data 
  services under its VPDS umbrella.  The first service offered on the platform, 
  frame relay, will be available in the second quarter of 1992., according to 
  Don Heath, MCI vice president for data marketing.  The network also offers a 
  migration path to future services, including switched multimegabit data 
  service and asynchronous transfer mod-based broadband integrated services 
  digital network, he said. 
 
  "What MCI is offering is a clear migration path to tomorrow's communications 
  networks," Heath said.  "We're opening the door to make broadband ISDN 
  services a reality." 
 
  The broadband platform will be cell-based, using 53-byte, fixed-sized data 
  packets.  Initially, MCI will offer the data services on permanent virtual 
  circuits.  Later, MCI will offer switched virtual circuits, which will 
  permit direct dial-up network with ISDN primary rate interface access. 
  Network access will be offered at 56Kb/s, fractional T-1 and T-1 speeds; 
  the backbone will operate at full T-1.

  AT&T Submarine Systems will introduce a new undersea cable product line at 
  Telecom '91 in Geneva this October, the company said at the beginning of 
  June.  Known now as the SL2000 cable system, the product will be renamed, and 
  a prototype exhibit will be on display at the show. 
 
  Although AT&T will design, install and maintain the system, the company has 
  been working with Kokusal Denshin Denwa of Japan for the past year to develop 
  optical amplifier technology for the SL2000 according to Debra Guancione, 
  product manager for AT&T Submarine Systems. 
 
  Current underseas systems require repeaters every 20 mile to 60 miles. 
  AT&T hopes to reach beyond 60 miles by the time the product becomes 
  available for service in 1995. 
 
  The cable system will package together bit rate-sensitive terminal equipment, 
  dispersion-shifted fiber, optically amplified repeaters and cable, all 
  configured according to customer requirements.  It will offer rates of 5 
  Gb/s, 25 Gb/s or 622 Mb/s per fiber pair.

  Motorola and PacTel Corporation will conduct field tests and market trails of 
  Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital cellular technology.  The trials 
  will take place in PacTel Cellular's Southern California service area.  The 
  agreement follows more than a year and a half of CDMA testing already 
  conducted by the two companies.  Among the activities planned for the trial 
  is the validation of Common Air Interface (CAI) specification.  CDMA and TDMA 
  represent two competing technologies designed for migrating cellular systems 
  to a digital standard and increasing subscriber capacity.

  New York Telephone is reorganizing along geographical lines, it disclosed 
  Friday.  The goal is to bring services, "closer to our customers," a 
  spokesman said, but gave no exact date for full implementation of the new 
  organization. 
 
  The reorganization creates three geographic market areas, each under a group 
  vice president, Douglas Mello, previously president of Nynex Business 
  Information Systems, will be responsible for midtown and southern Manhattan 
  and for the company's special data services for its top 200 accounts.  Arnold 
  Eckelman, former assistant vice president-operations, will be responsible for 
  norther Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.  Particia 
  Higgins, formerly AT&T's vice president for international sales operations, 
  will head the company's Long Island, mid-state and upstate New York 
  operations. 
 
  The decentralization is necessary to respond to "enormous" changes in the 
  telecommunications marketplace, including increased competition, said Richard 
  Jalkut, president and CEO.  The new organizations "will give us the 
  flexibility we need to respond to these changes," he said.

                      ------------------------------------ 
 
 
  On 6/19/91 at 7:34 P.M. San Bernardino, Ca. which serves 55,000 subscribers 
  experienced a 2 hour and 9 minute outage. This outage  was caused by a fault 
  in the Space Switch Interface Controller (SIC).  The SIC is the interface 
  between the APC/TPC's and the Space Switch portion of the Base Unit Network. 
  Without the SIC no call processing can take place since no network paths can 
  be established.  The SIC portion of the GTD-5 is a duplex device and should 
  not cause a total outage.  However, under certain double fault or backplane 
  fault conditions a duplex device can cause system outages. 
 
  San Bernardino has had a history of SIC problems, but none that had caused a 
  problem of this magnitude.  During early 1990 West Area personal worked on 
  the SIC - and no problems were reported for 8 months. 
 
  Beginning 6/21/91 (after the latest outage) I have been working with AGCS and 
  West Area TSS personnel to resolve this problem.  AGCS TAC and R&D personnel 
  were dispatched to the site to work with local personal on Saturday and 
  Sunday nights (6/22 and 6/23) to try and isolate the problem.  While using a 
  scope to monitor certain suspect leads, a SMA syndrome similar to the 
  syndromes output during previous problems was output.  No outage occurred. 
  Based upon this SMA being output when the pin was touched, a decision was 
  made to replace on of the wires that appeared to be very tight and could 
  possibly have "worn through" insulated or could have been pulling against 
  another pin.  After replacing the wire AGCS and TSS personnel could not cause 
  the syndrome to be generated. 
 
  On 6/24/91 we held a meeting to assess the progress in resolving the problem. 
  At that time we could not get more than a 70 percent comfort level that the 
  fault that had caused the outage had been cleared by replacing the wire. 
  Inspection of the wire under a microscope has not displayed any flaws. 
 
  Based upon the risk that another outage could occur, TSS west and myself have 
  recommended that the SIC backplane be replaced as soon as possible.  AGCS is 
  currently procuring the backplane.  A decision has been made to use a roll 
  around/portable frame to house a temporary SIC while the backplane is being 
  replaced.  The same concept used for the SVR 1641 16 Port BPC retrofit will 
  be used in San Bernardino to replace the SIC backplane.  This process will 
  minimize the outage time caused by the changeout.
