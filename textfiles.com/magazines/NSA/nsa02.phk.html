   3. The following step may be performedin teleprocessing offices to provide 
      backup AMA data in the vent that data from the final teleprocessing 
      session is lost or mutilated at the host collector.  In performing this 
      step, the time interval from now to the system initialization is 
      increased by the amount of time required to generate the AMA tape. 
 
      Caution: All AMA data recorded between the final AMA teleprocessing 
               session and the initialization will be lost.  Although the 
               following step will hlpe ensure the integrity of previously 
               recorded AMA data, the amount of AMA data that will be lost at 
               initialization time may increase by the amount of AMA data 
               recorded during the aforementioned time interval. 
 
      a. For offices that use teleprocessing, an optional manual AMA tape 
         writing session to dump secondary AMA blocks can be performed at this 
         time (AT&T 235-105-210, Procedure 3.19).  This tape should be saved 
         for backup purposes.

        Comment :  Due to design constraints, there may be a small amount of 
                   primary AMA data in use on disk at this point. 
 
                   To read the remaining primary AMA records;, start another 
                   AMA teleprocessing or tape session (repeat Step 2). 
 
                   To minimize the loss of AMA records, continue to initiate 
                   AMA sessions until the number of primary blocks in use 
                   (given by OP:AMA:DISK) reaches an acceptable level given 
                   call traffic.

   4. Note 1: If ONTCs are ACTIVE MAJOR/MINOR (that is, duplex) on MCC Page 
              1209, uses S as the application parameter (to preserve stable 
              calls).  If ONTCs are not duplex, use R sa the application 
              parameter. 
 
      Note 2: At this time, CU 1 contains 3 circuit packs that are not 
              compatible with the 5E4 software release currently cycling in the 
              AM. When CU 1 is forced on-line during the following initalizing 
              sequence, the switch will immediately go into a DMERT Level 3 
              recovery.  It is essential that the AM boot (42-S-54) be 
              performed immediately after forcing CU 1 on-line. 
 
   To perform the initialization, enter the following commands on the EAI Page: 
 
   a. To force CU 1 on-line, enter: 
 
      CMD                 11  Force CU 1 on-line, switch goes into level 3

       Note: The percent full (number records) of each of the three SEGMENTS 
             will demonstrate the loading of AMA records in the SDS.  Each time 
             the SEGMENT gets full, the disk writer writes that particular 
             SEGMENT to disk.  The value of the segment has been written to 
             disk after the boot.

    3. Note: The amount of time it will take to verify AMA recording depends on 
             the amount of traffic on the switch.  If your office has light 
             traffic, you should continue with the steps in this manual and 
             return to Step 2 (above) 10 minutes until you are satisfied that 
             AMA is recording properly. 
 
             Compare the OP:AMA:STATUS output from Step 1 with the 
             OP:AMA:STATUS output from Step 2. 
 
             The amount of AMA recorded depends on the amount of traffic on the 
             switch. 
 
             To verify that AMA is writing to a segment, compare the percent 
             full (number records) of the segments from Steps 1 and 2.  These 
             should increase with traffic on the switch. 
 
             When one segment fills, it should be written to disk and a new 
             segmentwill begin to fill.  To verify that AMA has written to 
             disk, check the LAST TIME DISK WRITER WROTE TO DISK - this value 
             should not be 00:00 00/00. 
 
             You can also verify the AMA has been written to disk by comparing 
             the output of the OP:AMA:MAPS commands issued in Steps 1a and 2a. 
             The second line of the output from the OP:AMA:MAPS gives a number 
             after WRITE PARTITION.  Below this are listed the various 
             partitions available.  Locate that partition corresponding  to the 
             write partition number.  Within this report are values for LPO and 
             LPS.  Thse values should increase when AMA is written to disk. 
 
             If AMA has successfully written to disk and is writing into a new 
             segment , AMA is recording properly.  If AMA is recording 
             properly, proceed to the next section. 
 
             If AMA is being recorded in one SEGMENT, but has not written to 
             disk, proceed to the next section but continue to monitor AMA.  To 
             continue the monitoring, reenter the OP:AMA:STATUS message evey 10 
             minutes until the AMA successfully writes to disk. 
 
             If all SEGMENTS still indicate EMPTY, seek techinal assistance. 
 
             Caution: If at any time you are unsure that AMA is recorind 
             properly, do not hesitate to seek technical assistance.

     EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW: 
 
     This guideline provides standards for provisioning trunk capacity (analog 
     and digital) in the central office switch.  This capacity consists of the 
     forecasted amounts of trunks which terminate on the swithc, sas well as 
     some quantity, method , to provide for unidentified, unforecasted 
     requirements.  The intent is to ensure the trunk capacity for central 
     office switches is engineered to cover the core engineering time frame, in 
     such a manner as to meet the unexpected customer demand and/or deployment 
     of unforeseen pari gain devices by GTE. 
 
     The existing PCM process authorizes engineering for forecasted switch 
     terminations to accommodate the message trunk forecast, the special 
     services forecsat, and pair gain host/remote links (future).  This 
     guideline provides instructions for the engineering of unforecasted 
     miscellaneous switch terminations with COE core job/projects. 
 
 
     GENERAL DISCUSSION: 
 
     Competition is pushing GTE to respond to the customer on a shorter time 
     interval.  In order to accomplish this, they must position GTE to allow 
     for rapid Trunk service provisioning.  The availability of central office 
     Trunk Terminations through controlled engineering for 5-10% unforeseen 
     demand will ensure their ability to succesfully respond to customer demands 
     in a timely manner.  The time required from customer request to 
     determination of equipment required, ordering, installing, testing is not 
     acceptable and is a contributing factor to GTE's loss of customer base. 
     Proper provisioning of trunk circuits in the right exchanges is essential 
     to responding to customers' needs. 
 
     Agreements are imminent which will provide for planned future pair gain 
     devices on the PCM by Planning.  Existing links for pair gain devices will 
     be in the POTS/TTE trunk forecast.  Therefore, margin for these links are 
     not provided via this process guideline. 
 
     This guideline does not provide margin for the message circuit trunk 
     forecast trunks.  The trunk forecasters will not build margin into the 
     groups which they manage by the TTE program.  In other words, existing or 
     imminent processes provide for switch terminations to accommodate TTE 
     forecast and H/R links. 
 
     Planning has concurred with their proposal to provide 5-10% margin for 
     trunk terminations in electronic switches.  The decision on the precise 
     amount of margin to be order should be made by the Traffic Engineer.  This 
     decision will be based on familiarity with the specific wire center and 
     service demands which have been experienced over the past several years, 
     along with knowledge of the specific switch configuration.  Switches in 
     remote, slow growth areas would obviously requirrreless margin than 
     switches in metropolitan, high growth areas.  Tandem or class 4/5 switches 
     may require larger margins due to the unpredictability of IXC demand. 
 
 
     GUIDELINE INSTRUCTION: 
 
     The existing PCM process authorizes engineering for forecasted switch 
     terminations to accommodate the message trunk forecast, the special 
     services forecast, and pair gain host/remote links (future).  This 
     guideline provides instructions for the engineering of unforecasted 
     miscellaneous switch terminations with COE core job/projects. 
 
     Every core job/project should provision to accommodate unforeseen demand 
     for central office trunk terminations in addition to the 
     forecasted/projected requirements of the engineering period.  The 
     unforeseen demand for trunk terminations will typically be engineered at 
     5% margin for rural offices and 10% margin for metropolitan offices. 
     Traffic Engineering of more than 10% Trunk Terminations margin will 
     require Planning review/approval. 
 
     Services that comprise unforeseen demand are: 
 
         o DID   (on COE Forecast as lump sum) 
 
         o WATS  (when served on trunks) 
 
         o Switched HI CAPS/Switched Data (DTI resources) (This is to be 
           forecasted by Market Forecasting as part of the CAF/SAL forecast.) 
 
         o MISC. (analog and/or DTI) 
 
     The central office switch common equipment capacity must be engineered to 
     carry both forecasted and unforeseen demand traffic as if all trunks were 
     incarry both forecasted and unforeseen demand traffic as if all trunks 
     were in service by the end of the core period.  Twenty-four CCS per trunk 
     should be used to properly provision the switch's capacity.  Application 
     as two-way split fifty percent incoming and fifty percent outgoing is 
     recommended unless that traffic engineer knows of local considerations 
     which warrant a different application. 
 
     When the engineer has determined the margin for the unforeseen demand, two 
     important decisions need to be evaluated: A) exact trunk or T1 quantities, 
     and B) associated CCS loads. 
 
     A.  Trunk quantities - The exact number of margin trunks to be added 
                            should be based on the TOGEN calculation of 
                            required trunking and associated frames.  Both 
                            analog and digital margin should be provided 
                            (unless a digital switch as been provision with no 
                            analog trunks for DID).  Margin trunks should be 
                            calculated to fill frames where possible, and 
                            consideration should also be given to the TCU 
                            layout of the office. 
 
     Note:  In all cases, when digital technology is the switch type, the 
            analog trunk frames should be wired so card slots are available 
            when shortages occur.  Digital trunk FIUs can hold two QSIC cards 
            each, which provides four T1 saaapc lines.  Currently they have to 
            pay right-to-use fees whenever a DTFIU is installed.  GTE is 
            working to implement TRU fees paid as QSIC cards are installed. 
            Once that is the case there will be value to not installing the 
            QSIC cards, leaving slots open until they are needed. 
 
     Example 1:  Metropolitan GTD-5 office requires 200 T1 spans for 
                 forecasted/known trunking requirements. 
 
                 200 T1 = 25 DTFIU 
 
                  20 T1 - Recommended margin at 10% 
 
                 220 T1 = 27.5 DTFIU 
 
                 Recommendation - Provide 224 T1s to completely fill 28 DTFIUs. 
                                  Analyze TCU/FIU layout to assess impact on 
                                  TCU requirements. The DTFIU may be eliminated 
                                  if it requires an additional TCU. 
 
     Note:  It is understood this example is representative of a "typical" 
            metropoloitan office.  Engineering judgement, based on specific 
            site characteristics, may require more than 10% to be budgeted and 
            installed (with proper approval by Palnning). 
 
     Example 2:  Rural GTD-5 office requires 30 T1 spans for forecasted/known 
                 trunking requirements. 
 
                 30 T1 = 3.75 DTFIU 
 
                  2 T1 - Recommended margin at 5% 
 
                 32 T1 = 4.0 DTFIU 
 
                 Recommendation - Analyze TCU/FIU layout.  If the fifth DTFIU 
                                  can be built into existing TCU, then provide, 
                                  if the fifth DTFIU would require another TCU, 
                                  do not provide. 
 
     B.  CCS loads - Once the trunk quantities have been determined, a margin 
         trunk group should be built into the trunk summary.  A CCS load of 24 
         CCS/trunk should be associated with these margin trunks so that common 
         equipment wil be calculated to include these trunks (specific impact 
         will be on TPC processors, MF receivers, and registers in the GTD-5 
         technology). 
 
     If additional TCUs and/or Digital Trunk FIus are required in the GTD5, or 
     additional Switch Modules are requires in the 5ESS, or more than 10% 
     margin is required, then Planning must review and provide 
     authorization/funding.

        Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) has been standardized as the target 
      transfer mode for B-ISDN.  It is believed to be a highly flexible 
      switching and multiplexing technique capable of supporting a wide range 
      of broadband and narrowband services.  Although the conceptual view of 
      ATM seems attractive, the feasibility of ATM in practice is uncertain for 
      real-time services such as full-motion video, especially under the 
      assumption that some degree of statistical multiplexing is desirable 
      within the ATM network.  The objective of this project was to evaluate 
      the technical feasibility and complexity of ATM for the delivery of four 
      full-motion video services:  television distribution, video-on-demand, 
      videoconferencing, and videotelephony.  The intra-LATA transport of these 
      video services over and end-to-end ATM network with a standard B-ISDN/ATM 
      interface was investigated. 
 
        The approach was based on a top-down view of the scenario at three 
      levels: services, network, and switching.  At the service level, the four 
      types of video services and their related end-toend network transport 
      requirements were characterized.  The effects of cell losses and cell 
      delays on video quality were investigated.  At the network level, 
      alternative service topologies were compared to find the preferred 
      topology for deployment of each service (see Figure 552-1).  The network 
      management and control issues were examined and traffic control methods 
      were proposed.  At the switch level, the performance and drawbacks of 
      proposed ATM switch architectures were evaluated for the purpose of 
      switching full-motion video (see Figure 552-2).  Finally, the end-to-end 
      transport requirements were related to the curretn state of ATM 
      techonology to draw conclusions about the technical feasibility of each 
      video service.

     Figure 552-2: A multistage self-routing fabric used in the Fujitsu 
                   FETEX-150 ATM switch.  Large ATM switches will be required 
                   in order to offer enhanced video services to a large 
                   customer base. 
 
 
 
     Television Distribution - Among the four video services studied, TV 
                               distribution services appear to be the most 
                               feasible, but large-scale multicast ATM switches 
                               will be required.  A network architecture that 
                               allows switching as close to the customer as 
                               possible is desirable. 
 
     Videoconferencing       - Network management and control issues are 
                               complex; the design, development, and deployment 
                               of network suitable for videoconferencing will 
                               be a major technical challenge in order to 
                               guarantee quality of service interms of cell 
                               delay/jitter and loss rate. 
 
     Videotelephony          - For ubiquitous service, the complexity of 
                               network level problems (e.g., traffic control, 
                               network management) will be significant. Large 
                               ATM switches will be required. 
 
     Video-on-Demand         - For true point-to-point VOD, a robust ATM 
                               backbone with processing capability for 
                               mid-calling signaling will be required. At 
                               present, such a network is not feasible, 
                               although B-ISDN should have this capability. An 
                               area-wide offering is feasible using "local" 
                               video gateways installed at either the access 
                               nodes or in remote units. 
 
     Overall, it was concluded that ATM techonology is not yet ready for its 
     role as a unified means of transport for B-ISDN.  Tha main obstacles lie 
     in the areas of network traffic control and the development of large-scale 
     switching systems.  Without effective solutions to these problems, any 
     ubiquitous offernign of on-demand, full-motion video services on a public 
     ATM network is not feasible in the near future.

   Multi-Point Token Ring LAN Bridging provides a unique and cost-effective 
   solution for customers that need to link multiple LAN sites only on an 
   "as-needed" basis, with the speed (dynamic bandwidth) but without the 
   incovneience and expense of T1 leased lines.  A Token Ring Interface United 
   (TRIU) provides a 4 Megabit-per-second, IBM Token Ring Network-compliant 
   interface which supports connections to the AS/400 and other IBM and non-IBM 
   hosts, front-end processors and communication controllers that support Token 
   Ring source routing. 
 
   The multi-point feature dynamically establishes bridged connections between 
   up to 32 remote locations.  The bridged channel is transparent to higher 
   layer protocols on the private Token Ring Network.  The IAP6000 Access 
   Server supports 56Kbps, 64 Kbps, 384 Kbps (H0) 1,472 Mbps (H10) and even n x 
   64 Kbps capability.  For instance, a corporate user, for a given 
   application, can "bundle" 4 x 64 Kbps B channels yielding 256 Kbps of 
   bandwidth between locations.  H0 channels can be concatenated in this 
   similar fashion.  Up to 32 B cahnnel bridge connections may be established 
   dynamically, on a call-by-call basis, per single TRIU.  A total of eight 
   TRIUs can be supported in a IAP6000 twenty-slot system. 
 
   Fractional T1 support using intergrated access allows the user to permanetly 
   assing channels in 64, 384 or 1,472 Kbps increments for heavy usage 
   applications.  The user now has the option of defining that a certain amount 
   of bandwidth over a single, intergrated network connection be "fixed" (or 
   dedicated) for a particular application use.  With private line services 
   over the same Primary Rate Interface access line.  For instance, users can 
   create hybrid networks and use both switched and private line tariffs to 
   optimize their network costs. 
 
   Transparent autoconnect automatically sets up a switched digital call 
   providing, in effect, virtual dedicated badnwidth on demand for users who 
   cannot justify the costs of private lines.  The IAP6000 Access Server can be 
   programmed through the system console to dial a specific remote location and 
   leave the connection active.  In this mode, the call is monitored and if for 
   any reason the connection is dropped, the IAP6000 Access Server 
   automatically re-establishes the call. 
 
   Dynamic event steram reproting enables the IAP6000 Access Server to relay 
   network information it recieves from the public switched network to an 
   adjunct information processor (PC, mini, mainframe).  The event steram link 
   is a 9600 Kpbs, asynchronous, RS-232 interface.  Information provided over 
   the D channel, and reported, includes: Calling Party Number Information; 
   Called Party Number Infomration; Time and Date of the Call, and Call 
   Type (Voice,Data).  Event stream reporting allows the IAP6000 Access Server 
   to share ISDN D-channel network intelligence with non-ISDN CPE so customized 
   applications such as call screening, call routing (dealer locator), 
   automatic call back (for abandoned or busy calls) and secure dial-back 
   services for comptuer access can be implemented.

Synopsis        : /bin/mail can be caused to invoke a root shell if given 
                  the proper arguments. 
============================================================================ 
 
 
   Synopsis Description: 
 
   /bin/mail is the local delivery agent for sendmail.  In 
   some particular instance, /bin/mail parse its argument incorrectly 
   and therefore, mail are being drop into the bit bucket. 
 
   If there are users that has "f" has the second character, you might want 
   to try the following: (substitute "af" with anyuser with "f" as second 
   character) 
 
   From any machine except mailhost: 
 
   /bin/lib/sendmail -t -v <<END 
   From: anyuser 
   to: anyuser 
   Subject: test 
   Cc: af          <-- substitute any username with second character as "f" 
   test 
 
   END 
 
   When the mail arrived on mailhost, sendmail process will invoke 
   /bin/mail with the following argument "/bin/mail -r anyuser -d af 
   anyuser".  Now you are in trouble.  The following are different 
   scenarios for /bin/mail. 
 
   [1] /bin/mail -r anyuser -d af  <mailmessages            fine 
   [2] /bin/mail -r anyuser -d anyone af ... <mailmessages  fine 
   [3] /bin/mail -r anyuser -d af anyone ... <mailmessages  Ah a Bug 
 
    In Case 3, /bin/mail thinks that you want to read mail instead of 
    delivering mail.  Therefore, mail messages is lost. 
 
    Now this probably won't work on most Internet Sun/Os Unix systems.  But ah 
    this works just dandy on direct dail ups and other networks.  So go out 
    and practice your molestations.
