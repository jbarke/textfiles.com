    Welcome to National Security Anarchists (NSA) first Newsletter.  We are 
  pretty much unlike other groups out there in that H/P wasteland.  We are more 
  interested in providing new ideas, and new information.  Now everyone can 
  scan, hack codes, hack unix.  Now in order to further these abilities we must 
  take a look at the new technology that most of you have overlooked.  From 
  just looking at these new ideas and concepts, you can develop you H/P skills 
  even more.  Now the release of NSA Newsletter will come out when damn ready 
  to.  Rush a newsletter, expect a shitty newsletter.  Plain and simple.

                == Teleos Access Server, The Missing Switch? == 
 
 
    The Access Server is Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) located in the 
  position formerly occupied by a T1 multiplexor.  The Access Server is a 
  switch that allows simultaneous Bandwidth-On-Demand access to each of the 23 
  64 Kbps B channels on the PRI interface. 
    The Teleos Access Server was designed to add value through switched access 
  to those emerging switched digital network services.  Specific interface 
  cards are then added to the Access Server for each type of access (premises 
  or netowrk) desired.  End users no longer need to provision T1 channels among 
  voice, data, image, and videoconferencing.  Currently, network interfaces are 
  available for T1 and PRI in all the protocol formats used by North American 
  Inter-Exchange and Local Exchange Carriers.  Premises-side interfaces are 
  availbable for T1, PRI, BRI, IBM token Ring and V.35 (through the Teleos 
  Escort PRI TA). 
 
    A Teleos Access Server will serve as the single point of switched digital 
  network access from teh store.  Older PBXs will be connected to the Access 
  Server via a Teleos T1 interface.  An IBM 3174 Controller and a workstation 
  will be attached to the Token Ring.  All access from the store with the 
  exception of local voice and local data calls will be via PRI. 
 
    CICS applications such as Inventory, Pricing, Payroll, etc. willl run on an 
  IBM Series 1 processor.  Both the Series 1 and the Token Ring will connect to 
  a modem sharing device for access to a 9.6 Kbps leased line for SDLC access 
  to an IBM 3090 host processor.  Credit card verifications for business 
  customers will be directed to the Series 1 which permits access to the host. 
 
    A key application driving the network architecture involes image transfer 
  technology, which could lead to the presentation of high resolution images to 
  the store's merchandiser to assist in selecting styles and colors of 
  merchandise to make available in their stores.  The images can reside on the 
  file server or the mainframe at the data center.  They are accessed using a 
  high-resolution PC workstation with a graphical user interface.  In trails 
  thus far, the call setup time through the IAP6000 Access Server hs been less 
  then two seconds. 
 
    The IAP6000 Access Server at the data center haso nly a Token Ring 
  interface on the premises side, and is connected on the network side over a 
  direct access PRI to MCI's DMS-250. 
 
    Teleos Communications has forecast that using switched digital services 
  rather than dedicated T1 network will save about 27% in recurring monthly 
  network operating charges for this netowrk. 
 
    Note: 
        Teleos, together with Network Software Associates (NSA), is pleased to 
      announce the availabbility of a PC-based 3270 emulation application. This 
      product is compatible with IBM's new 3174 Establishment Controller 
      equipped with the recently announced Basic Rate Interface (BRI) adapter. 
 
        When used with these new IBM products, the Teleos/NSA soution allows 
      ISA bus PCs to achieve 3270 terminal access and printer in an IBM S370 or 
      S390 environment via local or remote cluster controllers.  The product 
      solution consists of AdaptSNA 3270 Emulator software form NSA and Teleos' 
      B101PC Terminal Adapter.

                           == Switching Interface == 
 
    The Teleos Escort is a Primary Rate Interface Terminal Adapter (PRI TA) 
  that lets you leverage the power of the switched digital network by offering 
  access to a wide variety of high-speed switches services.  These include AT&T 
  ACCUNET Switched Digital Services (56,64,336,384, and 1536Kbps), MCI Vnet 
  Switched 56, and U.S. Sprint VP 56. 
 
    The Escort's unique Bandwith-On-Demand feature allows you to dial up 
  network bandwidth for applications on an "as needed" basis.  You pay only for 
  the bandwidth you use and access it only when you need it, resulting in a 
  reduction in overall transmission costs.  This feature makes the Escort 
  ideally suited for applications such as videoconferencing. 
 
    The Escort supports dual standard RS366 dialing interfaces that let you 
  access the direct dialing capabilities of video codecs.  The Escort also 
  provides an interface for serial, synchronous host communication via dual 
  V.35 or dual RS449/RS530.  Thus, by using the codec's keypad, you can easily 
  establish a videoconference with a remote video codec. 
 
    Escort options include an intergrated T1 Channel Service Unit (CSU), which 
  allows direct connection to the T1 line without additional external 
  equipment, and a Multi-Channel Synchronization feature, which provides the 
  capablity to bundle 56/64 Kbps channels into n X 64 increments 
 
    Simply put, the Escort allows you to link customers, suppliers, and 
  strategic partner over Switched Digital Networks with the flexibility and 
  cost efficiency of Bandwidth-On-Demand.

                          == Teleos Virtual Networking == 
                     == Combining Private & Public Networks == 
 
 
    Teleos Access Servers give corporate end users the "best of both worlds": 
  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Hybrid Private Networks (HPN).  These 
  networks deliver advance services over the more flexible and cost-effective 
  public switched digital network. 
 
    This emerging networking environment allows small and medium size 
  businesses, as well as large corporations, to leverage the full menu of 
  switched services for intra-and inter-enterprise networking applications. 
  Among the advance virtual networking features enabled by an IAP6000 Access 
  Server are multi-point.  Token Ring LAN bridging, distributed image 
  communications, video conferencing services, intra/inter-bulk file transfer, 
  and multi-vendor PBX interconnection. 
 
    For companies considering switched networking or phasing out cumbersome, 
  expensive private networks, the new features allow users to define a virtual 
  networking environment, mixing both public and private leased lines to 
  optimize network management resources, costs, and network traffic for more 
  competivite decisions-making based on information access, flow, and 
  distribution.  Virtual Networking offers the following advantages: 
 
 
    o Just-In-Time Bandwidth Optimization 
 
       Customers want dynamic bandwidth allocation on demand and want to pay 
       for it when they need it. "Just-In-Case" based private networks do not 
       offer this flexibility. 
 
    o Information Sharing 
       Virtual networking provides true information sharing with partners and 
       customers by enabling simple and flexible network topologies for either 
       vice, data networking, image, or videoconferencing. 
 
    o Unlimited Network Redundancy 
       Customers can use the built-in-redundancy of public Switched Digital 
       Networks eliminating the need for building backup routes as required by 
       proprietary private networks. 
 
    o Choice of Carriers 
       All major carriers offer Switched Digital Network services with an open 
       standard switched access (i.e., ISDN PRI) enabling a global networking 
       perspective for the first time.

    This GTE Government Systems project has the broad, year 2000 objective 
  to develop an advanced military tactical communication system 
  architecture and software/hardware prototypes based on the most advanced 
  field-qualified technologies.  The first year of this multiyear project 
  effort was in the year 1990. 
 
    First, a set of preliminary operational requirements was put together. 
  The original objective for this project was for a MSE (mobile subscriber 
  equipment) replacement, using the most modern technology, suitable for 
  deployment in European terrain.  However, the most changes in the 
  world's geopolitical scence required a more general perspective. The 
  first operational requirements considered were the following: 
 
 
   @ Radio access only --- no wirelines required. 
 
   @ Moveability --- near-instantaneous take-down, set-up 
 
   @ Security, privacy. 
 
   @ Low probability of detection --- no radiation hotspots to reveal presence 
 
   @ Jamming resistant. 
 
   @ Ubiquitous low and medium band switching.  Selective broadband switching. 
 
   @ Interoperability with other communication systems 
 
   @ Survivability/reliability. 
 
   @ Minimal size and weight. 
 
   @ Position location. 
 
   @ Dialing by spoken name or unit or number. 
 
 
    A baseline architecture was conceived to meet these requirements. 
  This architecture has the following capabilities: 
 
   @ Phased array antennas permitting electronic variation of the 
     number of beams and their gains. 
 
   @ An all-radio interface using Spread Spectrum/Code Division 
     Multiple Access (SS/CDMA) for the line side and trunk side signals. 
 
   @ A single size Electronics Vehicle (EV) containing all system 
     eletronics; radio transceivers, antennas, and switches. 
 
    This architecture, in the principle, meets all the operational 
  requirements.  The universal SS/CDMA meets those requirements 
  relating to the radio interface.  The great mobility of this 
  architecture allows communication to begin as soon as the vehicle 
  stops.  The system self-configures, without prior planning.  The 
  Electronic Vehicle nodes (Look at diagram below) seek EV identifies 
  itself;  The mobile station's presence in the coverage zone of the 
  new EV automatically promulgates to all other system nodes; any 
  mobile station found can receive calls. 
 
    In 1991, further definition of this baseline architecture, the 
  consideration of different architectures, and the continuing 
  assessment of applicable technologies, will continue.

    The objective of this multiyear project is to develop advanced network 
  planning systems that will assist planners in producing cost-effective 
  facility expansion plans for the cellular networks used by GTE mobilnet 
  and the interoffice networks used by the telcos.  The project aims to 
  develop graphical, easy to use systems that employ state-of-the-art 
  optimization algorithms, allowing the planners to use them interactively 
  to evaluate several alternatives and generate cost-effective plans. 
 
    During 1990, the research effort focused mainly on developing a 
  facilities planning system for the cellular networks used by GTE 
  Mobilnet.  This system comprised optimization algorithms for determining 
  minimum-cost facility plans for the rapidly growing networks and 
  cost-effective network topologies that provide a desired level of 
  reliability.  The graphical interface for these algorithms is currently 
  being developed using X-windows/Motif presentation graphics and the Unix 
  operating system to ensure the portability of the tools to alternative 
  hardware platforms, and the future compatibility with other planning 
  systems. 
 
    A related task, that originated in response to a request from the GTE 
  Government Systems staff working on the Airfone ][ project, focused on 
  the design of the terrestrail facility network that connects the ground 
  stations to the Airfone switches. 
 
 
INTERCONNECT FACILITIES PLANNING SYSTEM FOR GTE MOBILNET 
 
    Mobile telephone services are expected to be one of the fastest 
  growing areas of telecommunications over the next decade, and this rapid 
  growth in the customer base will require a corresponding growth in the 
  network facilities.  A fundamental problem that arises in designing the 
  facilities network for a cellular system is to determine how to expand 
  the capacity of the facilities over a given planning time horizon to 
  meet projected demand at minimum cost.  The transmission facilities used 
  in the cellular systems are either privately owned (e.g. microwave) or 
  leased from the local telcos (T1s, fiber).  The capacity expansion plan 
  has to determine where and when to place concentrators in the network, 
  what type of concentrators to use, which cell sites to connect to each 
  of the hubs, which cells to connect directly to the Mobil Telephone 
  Switching Office, and what facilities to use on each of the links. 
  Optimizaion algorithms were developed to address these questions, and 
  the graphical interface for the system is currently under development. 
  In addition, preliminary work was completed on alogorithms to determine 
  the network topology that should be deployed to survive any single link 
  failure.  A prototype system was presented to the Mobilnet staff for 
  feedback and is currently under revision.  The transfer of the 
  alpha-version to Mobilnet is expected in the first half of 1991. 
 
    Figure Below illustrates the output of the prototype system.  This is 
  the final design toplolgy for a representative network; it shows where 
  the concentrators should be located and how the cell sites should be 
  connected to the hubs and to the Mobil Telephone Switching Office 
  located at Warrensville Heights, Ohio.

FACILITIES PLANNING FOR THE TERRESTRIAL NETWORK FOR AIRFONE ][ 
 
    Due to the advent of new technology and the expected increase in 
  demand for air-to-ground telecommunications services, GTE Airfone is 
  currently considering the design and implementation of a new system, 
  called Airfone ][.  One of the questions that arises in the design of 
  the new system is, given the locations of the ground stations and their 
  busy-hour traffic forecast, where should switches that provide the 
  connection to the public-switches in order to minimize the overall cost 
  of the switches and the interconnect facilities. 
 
    To evaluate the impact of increasing the number of switches on the 
  cost of the interconnect facilities, this study considered five design 
  scenarios: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 switches, with one switch always fixed at 
  Chicago.  The study was carried out in two stages.  In the first stage, 
  a mathematical model was used to determine the optimum locations for the 
  switches, assuming that the ground stations would be connected directly 
  to the switches (i.e., a star topology).  Given a switch location and 
  the ground stations it will serve, the second stage determined a 
  minimun-cost topology to connect the ground stations to this swtich. 
  This topology allowed multiplexing and took advantage of the economies 
  of scale offered by the structure of the DS0 and DS1 tariffs and was 
  determined using a private network design tool, CAPT1N, developed at GTE 
  Laboratories during 1989 as part of Network Facilities Planning project. 
  The results of the second stage indicated the cost saving that result 
  from multiplexing for each cluster of switch and gorund stations to be 
  served by the switch.  The results of this study can now be used to 
  evaluate the tradeoff between the cost of the swithces and the cost of 
  the interconnect facilities to determine the number of switches that 
  should be placed in the network.  Figure below illustrates the network 
  topology with multiplexing for the four-switch scenario and the switch 
  at Chicago, transimiting to cells.

                         "Nazi Video Games Circulating" 
                                   Written by 
                               Los Angeles Times 
 
 
     LOS ANGELES ---- Undergound computer-video games circulating among 
   Austrain and German students test the ability to manage a Nazi death 
   camp and to distinguish between Aryans and Jews, a Holocaust study 
   center says. 
     Eight copies of the programs, designed for home computers, were 
   obtained by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.  The center 
   demonstrated two of the programs for The Associated Press on Monday. 
 
     Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's associate dean, said the 
   programs are based on the Holocaust but often substitute Turks, many 
   of whom work in Germany, for Jews. 
 
     In one program, "KZ Manager", the player must sell gold fillings, 
   lampshades and labor to earn enough money to buy gas and add gas 
   chambers to kill Turks at the Treblinka death camp.  "KZ" is an 
   abbreviation of the German word for con- centration camp. 
 
     The player must correctly answer questions about Turks or be taken 
   by a Grim Reaper figure to the Buchenwald death camp. 
 
     What yo uwant to do now if you love playing computer games, you 
   want to go right back in adn you want to win," Cooper said.  "It's a 
   very shrewd psychology in terms of the design of the game" 
 
     Reports of the games have circulated for several years, but they 
   were not believed to be widespread until a recent surge of reports in 
   the Austrian media, he said. 
 
     Newspapers reported that a poll of students in one Austrian city 
   said that nearly 40 percent knew of the games and more than 20 
   percent had seen them, Cooper said. 
 
     The game "Aryan Test" says it is by Adolf Hitler Software Ltd.  The 
   game "Anti-Turk Test" says it was made in Buchenwald by Hitler & Hess. 
 
     Distribution has been by electronic mail,  under-the-counter sales, word 
   of mouth and in deceptive packaging on store shelves.  Cooper said the 
   packaging of the "KZ Manager" game resembles "some sort of money game." 
 
     Cooper believes the games are the work of neo-Nazi propagandists (*** Yea 
   it's probably out own fucking gov't too ***) seeking youthful followers 
   through a technology largely unfamiliar to their parents. 
 
     "Not shocking to anybody, the kids are way ahead of the adults, and this 
   is one area where the Nazis, the fascists, have found a way in," he said.

                   "Nazi-Games Maker Target of Reward Offer" 
                                  Written by 
                               Associated Press 
 
 
     LOS ANGELES --- The Simon Wiesenthal Center offerd a $25,00 reward 
   Friday in hopes of finding the maker of neo-Nazi video games that 
   have been circulating in Europe.  It asked the German government to 
   match the sum. 
 
     "We believe that this would demonstrate a seriousness to finally 
   bringing these culprits to justice," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of 
   the Los Angeles-based Holocaust research center.  The reward was 
   offered for information leading to a conviction. 
 
     The underground games, which are in German, have strong anti-Jewish 
   and anti-Turkish themes.  In one program, KZ Manager, the player must 
   sell gold filings, lampshades and labor to earn money to buy gas and 
   gas chambers to kill Turks at the Treblinka death camp.  "KZ" is an 
   abbreviation of the German word for concentration camp. 
 
     The reward was triggered by a telegram sent by German Chancellor 
   Helmut Kohl to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., on Thursday and 
   forwarded to the Wiesenthal Center. 
 
     D'Amato last week wrote to Kohl and Austrain President Kurt 
   Waldheim, asking them to prevent distribution of the games after the 
   center publicized their apparent spread in Germany, Austria, and the 
   Netherlands.  D'Amota's letters cited provisions of the Austrain and 
   German criminal codes that forbid inciting racial hatred. 
 
     Word of the games has circulated for several years, but reports in 
   the Austrain media indicate they are becoming more widespread, said 
   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's associate dean. 
 
     In a translated copy of the telegram, Kohl told D'Amato that he is 
   disgusted by the games but indicated that the problem has already 
   passed. 
 
     "As far as can be ascertained, these products have not appeard 
   since early 1990," Kohl said.  "Before that, some of these evil items 
   had emerged, but they were not sold over the counter in normal 
   stores." 
 
     He said that the games were confiscated when found but that the 
   manufactuer has not been identified.

                             "'Cracker' Speaks Out" 
                                  Written by: 
                                  UNIX Today! 
 
 
    New York--A man identifying himself as as one of the Dutch crackers 
    who was filmed breaking into U.S. computers by Dutch television said 
    last week he found the break-ins to be easy to do. He also said he 
    doesn't believe he did anything wrong. "A guest account is a guest 
    account.  I considered myself a guest on the system," said a man who 
    identified himself only as "Hank." Last Wednesday, Hank, who said he 
    was 24 years old, gave a telephone interview to Emmanuel Goldstein, 
    editor of the cracker journal 2600.  The interview aired on 
    Goldstein's radio program "Off the Hook," on WBAI-FM, a publicly 
    funded New York alternative radio station. 
 
      There was no conclusive evidence to indicate whether Hank was 
    genuine, though some details he gave matched those given out by 
    victims of the Dutch crackers and by people with contacts in the 
    cracker community.  Hank spoke English with a slight accent. 
 
      He would not discuss specifics of sites broken into, how he got in 
    or what he found once he was there. 
 
      Hank said the cracking is its own reward, and when he's logged 
    into a system, he's interested only in the system itself, not the 
    data on it.  One radio caller asked whether he'd ever gained access 
    to politicaly interesting information. "When i get onto a system, 
    I'm not interested in the stuff there," he said.  "I'm not 
    interested in going throught love letters or anything else." 
 
      He said if he had access to classified information---something 
    authorities say he did not have--it's the user's fault. "I think 
    it's pretty stupid to put classified data on a public network," he 
    said. 
 
      Hank said he believes computer laws will not control cracking. "I 
    think it's not a solution to prohibit hacking, because the people 
    will go underground," he said. 
 
      Hank said he has been cracking about three years, and specializes 
    in breaking into Unix systems. 
 
      At first, he contacted systems administrators of systems he 
    cracked to alert them to problems.  Some of them seemed to want to 
    use the information to correct the problem, but many seemed more 
    interested in hunting him down, he said.  And those were the ones 
    most likely to leave security holes uncorrected, he added. 
 
      He said he searched for default log-ins that were shipped with 
    systems by the manufacturer, and often not changed by users. 
    Goldstein would not comment on how he got in touch with Hank. "I run 
    a hacking publication, and there's one in Holland," he said. He said 
    he believes Hank to be authentic.  "Holland isn't that big a place. 
    Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.
