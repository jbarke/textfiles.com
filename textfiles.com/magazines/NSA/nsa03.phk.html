  Welcome to National Security Anarchists Newsletter #3.  We have heard many 
  great responses from the so-called H/P wastelands.  Yes, so barren, but there 
  still exists a few intelligent minds left.  While the rest of H/P world 
  continues to jerk themselves off with codes, scans, and old issues of Phrack. 
  One could can be developing their H/P skills even more by just doing Hacker 
  Basic.  Hacker Basic?  No, not a programming language.  But the ability to 
  READ!  Yes, what most of America teenagers cannot do today, but yet excel 
  greatly in their current career, Stupidity.  Reading allows you to expand 
  your ideas and concepts.  Sure read old information, but what do you do after 
  that? Most of you just sit around, praising Phrack & LOD/H. These guys are 
  dead and gone!  Sure, remember them and remember them well.  But you cannot 
  live in the past, for while you sit on your ass, Ma Bell can then destroy 
  you, destroy the whole concept of the H/P world.  What do you choose?

  CALL GAPPING FOR LOCAL CODES 
 
    Allows control of incoming trunk-to-line calls only, line-to-line calls 
    only, or control of both at different gap intervals - defined as control of 
    traffic categories. 
 
    The number of simultaneous code controls (destination and local) are 
    increased from 64 to 256. 
 
    Controls calls to terminating codes for the following: 
 
      o  Any subscriber line 
      o  Hunt group pilot number 
      o  Attendant group listed directory number(s) 
      o  10-digit directory number in a subtending PBX 
 
    Gap intervals settable for: 0(no control), 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 ,15, 30, 60, 
    120, 300, and 600 seconds.  An infinite interval is also available. 
 
 
  DEFINE "VIA" ROUTES BY TRUNK GROUP NUMBER 
 
    Allows the Network Manager to engineer each site for associated traffic 
    types to route index in terms of route index pair relationships for reroute 
    controls.  This provides the capability to specify the reroute as a "from" 
    TGN and a "to" (VIA) TGN without having to recall complex routing chains 
    and routing index information. 
 
 
  RATE INTERVALS FOR NSM CONTROLS 
 
    Provides the option of designating the amount of traffic controlled by rate 
    (time) interval for the following NSM route controls: 
 
       o  Cancel-To 
       o  Cancel-From 
       o  Skip Route 
       o  Spray Reroute 
       o  Spray Immediate Reroute 
       o  Selective Trunk Reservation 
 
    Selectable intervals for each traffic type: 1-60 seconds in 1 second 
    increments, 120, 300, and 600 seconds.  An infinite interval is also 
    available as well as 2 calls per second for intervals less than 1 second. 
 
 
  SPRAY ROUTE CONTROLS 
 
    Reroute controls will be modified from the existing eight pairs of from/to 
    routes to eight sets of from/to routes.  A set of from/to routes consists 
    of one traffic donor (from) route and up to seven out-of-chain "VIA" (to) 
    routes accessed with a spray hunt technique.  The spray hunt technique 
    diveds the rerouted traffic evenly among the out-of-chain trunk groups 
    through a rotation scheme.  The reroute control will permit the option to 
    define the traffic donor (from) and "VIA" (to) routes by trunk group 
    numbers. 
 
 
 
  SS7 BASED NON-ISDN VOICE MESSAGE WAITING INDICATION CONTROL 
 
    Extension of the SVR 1641 Voice messaging feature using a SS7 network 
    based, ANSI standard, messaging system.  The GTD-5 will receive SS7 
    requests from a Voice Message Storage and Retrieval System (VMSR) to 
    activate or deactivate a Voice Waiting Indicator (MWI) for a subscriber. 
    The GTD-5 will update the subscriber's MWI and return a successful or 
    failure response via SS7 to VMSR. 
 
    This feature does not impact the existing in-band VMSR capabilities.  An 
    individual GTD-5 site may have only in-band or only SS7 or both 
    capabilities.  This feature provides the GTD-5 with capability to support 
    up to 127 different VMSR systems. 
 
 
  INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR 15 DIGITAL DIALING (CCITT E.164) 
 
    The GTD-5 can presently handle 15 dialed digits for digit translation 
    screening and call routing functions.  GTE AMA record formats will be 
    modified to account for 15 digital international numbers as specified in 
    CCITT E.164 recommendations. 
 
    Bellcore LSSGR AMA specifications have not been issued for 15 digit 
    international records and will not be included in this SVR. 
 
 
  CALL WAITING/CALL FORWARDING BUSY INTEGRATION 
 
    Currently, Call Waiting overrides Call Forwarding Busy. Customer in focus 
    groups who have both Personal Secretary (VMSR) and Call Waiting have 
    requested the ability to have calls forwarded to their Call Waiting feature 
    while they are receiving a call.  This feature enhancement will facilitate 
    the ability to see Call Waiting and Voice Mail services together. 
 
    This is a changed feature interaction.  No new classmarks are involved. All 
    subscribers with both features active will get this new interaction. 
 
    For a terminating party disconnect with call waiting situation, the 
    terminator will be rung for custom calling as in current treatment. During 
    custom call rering, call forwarding will be attempted at the end of the 
    original call forwarding don't answer timeout. 
 
 
  CUSTOMER CONTROLLABLE RINGING INTERVAL FOR CALL FORWARD DON'T ANSWER 
 
    This feature allows the customer who subscribes to Call Forwarding Don't 
    Answer the ability to control the number of rings (1-9) before the call is 
    forwarded.  The type of ringing provided for a call will not be affected by 
    this feature. 
 
 
  AUDIBLE MESSAGE WAITING INDICATION VIA PERIODIC RINGING BURSTS 
 
    With the exception of customers served by featurephones, Message Waiting 
    Indication is currently provided on via stutter dial tone.  As an option 
    this feature would provide a double ring (0.5 seconds on, 0.5 seconds off, 
    0.5 seconds on) to indicate a waiting message.  The first double ring would 
    occur within 5 minutes of receiving a message and would be repeated every 
    15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes as selected by a Recent Change command.  The 
    customer controls this feature's activation/deactivation similar to Call 
    Forwarding Variable.  This feature will not be given to a line with the Do 
    Not Disturb Feature activated. 
 
 
  ANONYMOUS CALLER REJECTION 
 
    This feature is a variation of the CLASS Selective Call Rejection feature. 
    CLASS Anonymous Caller Rejection prevents termination of anonymous calls 
    (Calling Number Delivery Blocked) to a CLASS customer's line by routing 
    these calls to a special announcement which informs the caller that they 
    may complete a call to this subscriber if they allow their calling number 
    to be delivered. 
 
 
  TERMINATING END OFFICE SCANNING ALLOWED (TR-TSY-000215 3.5.8) 
 
    This feature allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with TR-TSY-000215, Issue 1, 
    Sept. 88. 
 
    The parameter as defined in the referenced TR is used to control whether an 
    office will request termination scanning as the initial choice of 
    originating scanning for outgoing Automatic Callback/Automatic recall 
    (AC/AR) requests. The current GTD-5 design interprets this parameter to 
    apply to inbound terminating scanning AC/AR requests.  With both parameters 
    defined in the GTD-5, GTE may enforce originating or terminating scanning 
    on outbound requests and also force other offices to use originating 
    scanning rather than terminating scanning. 
 
 
  AC/AR FEATURE TIME RANGES (TR-TSY-000215 AND 227) 
 
    This feature allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with the latest TR's. 
 
    The following timers will be modified: 
 
      o  T1 Originating Scanning Rate = 10 - 120 seconds (60 seconds 
         recommended) 
      o  T2 Wait Between Unanswered Special Ringing Attempts = 1-12 minutes 
   (4 minutes recommended-maximum number of unanswered 
         special rings is 15) 
      o  T8 Resume Term Scanning to Same Line Timing = 17 (2 ringing cycles) - 
         60 seconds (35 seconds-5 ringing cycles is recommended) 
      o  T10 Maximum Time Callback remains Queued = 3-4 hours 
 
 
  COT-IDENTIFICATION CALL WAITING INDICATION IN PRINTOUT 
 
    This is an enhancement to the Customer Originated Trace feature to provide 
    a printout that will indicate that the last answered call was a Call 
    Waiting call. 
 
 
  SCREEN LIST EDITING CHANGES 
 
    This is an enhancement to allow the following CLASS Screen List Editing 
    options: 
 
      o  Allow code for deleting all entries 
      o  Allow code for deleting all private entries 
      o  Allow last answered number to be added to any screening list 
      o  New treatment of entry with private mark when entered as public 
 
 
  AC/AR REQUESTS TO HGRP PILOT NUMBERS 
 
    This allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with the appropriate TR's by queuing 
    calls placed via AC/AR if all members of a hunt group are busy and 
    immediately completing AC/AR calls if any member is idle. 
 
  AC/AR INTERACTION WITH CALL WAITING 
 
    The GTD-5 currently will queue an AC/AR request to a line with call waiting 
    when the line is busy with one call.  This feature will not queue the call 
    but go to immediate processing and the terminating line will receive a call 
    waiting tone. 
 
 
  914E WILTRON CABLE ANALYZER SHARING 
 
    Siemens Transmission Systems has developed a feature on the 914E MXU which 
    allows sharing of one Wiltron Cable Analyzer (MCA) among up to 5 MXU units 
    in the same cabinet.  the GTD-5 MXU software will be modified to allow up 
    to 16 i14E MXU's to share the same MCA.  The MCA cannot be shared between 
    Direct Interfaced MXU's and COT Interfaced MXU's. 
 
 
  PERFORM SHORT % WAIT(S) WITHOUT ALLOCATING A BUFFER 
 
    Timeout buffers will no longer be used for short waits, under 5 slices/50 
    milliseconds.  This will save real time and reduce buffer pool 
    fragmentation caused by short waits. 
 
  SPEED UP BUFFER ALLOCATION SEARCH LOOP 
 
    With the removal of sequence buffers from the buffer pool, buffer pool 
    fragmentation has become less of a problem.  Now with less fragmentation, 
    processor real time in the APC will be saved by adopting a buffer 
    allocation method similar to non-APC processors, which reduces time spent 
    in the allocation search loop.  In addition, real time will also be saved 
    during buffer de-allocation by releasing multiple buffers at one time using 
    a new "flush buffers" function. 
 
 
  OUTGOING TRUNKS CALL CUTOFF ENHANCEMENT 
 
    On a line-to-trunk call, there are occasions where a "hangup" from the 
    outgoing trunk is caused by a network problem.  This feature provides a SMA 
    printout for the Telco to identify the specific trunk group, trunk, carrier 
    ID, calling and called numbers as well as the calculated interval of cutoff 
    elapsed time. 
 
    This feature only applies to calls where called party hangup does not 
    release the call (e.g. called party timed released. 
 
 
  MEASUREMENT CALLING/BILLING NUMBER DELIVERS TO CUSTOMER LINE 
 
    This feature modifies GTD-5 implementation to be compliant with LSSGR AMA 
    format (TR-TSY-000031, Issue 3, Jan. 90) for usage sensitive billing and 
    AMA format for the calling number delivery (CAD) feature. 
 
    This feature is applicable to any line (directory number) assigned the 
    Calling Number Delivery or Calling Number Display features. Billing will no 
    longer be based on activation/deactivation of these features. 
 
    A Usage-Sensitive CAD is assigned to a DN via a service order. The count of 
    DNs delivered will not be applicable for intragroup calls. Up to 65,000 
    lines can be assigned usage-sensitive CAD.  Each DN assigned the 
    Usage-Sensitive CAD feature will have two AMA counts with a maximum value 
    of each counter of 32,767: 
 
      o  Count of DNs delivered 
      o  Count of private and out-of-area indicators delivered 
 
    An AMA record will be generated once every 24 hours of each DN with 
    non-zero counts.  An AMA record will be generated immediately if a 
    particular counter reaches 32,000.  If all counters are zero, or no lines 
    in the CO have the feature assigned, a single record is produced to 
    indicate the task executed correctly. 
 
 
  FLIP CMD ON RSNW DOES NOT WORK 
 
    This feature extends the Base Unit capability of a "simplex-to-simplex 
    switch", the ability to change from a simplex 0 configuration to a simplex 
    1 configuration (or vice versa) without an intervening duplex stage, to a 
    Remote Unit Network. 
 
    This capability is useful during retrofit intervals and repair of faults 
    where the system was not able to correctly isolate the faulty copy. 
 
 
  MXU OUTAGE TIME REDUCTION 
 
    This feature reduces the software loading time for multiple MXU processors 
    loads.  A broadcast mechanism will be used to transport fewer messages 
    between the APC and the outermost superordinate processor (TCU or RSU). 
 
    This feature will be transparent to the craftsperson and is estimated to 
    result in 4% reduction in APC real time per MXU.

                             == GTE Project 434 == 
 
 
  With the move to higher speed networks, many fundamental issues in control 
  and design of networks need to be examined afresh.  This project has 
  attempted to address critical architectural issues to ensure that all aspects 
  of these emerging high-speed technologies reflect the needs of GTE's future 
  high-bandwidth services. 
 
  The feasibility of transporting motion video over an ATM (asynchronous 
  transfer mode) network was investigated for Telops, with a major report 
  provided (jointly with Project 552) on the feasibility of end-to-end ATM for 
  a number of video services.  Through experiments, it was demonstrated that 
  performance improves when the cell transmissions from each video source are 
  smoothed at least on a per frame basis; this removes constraints on the 
  synchronization of the frames across video sequences sharing the same network 
  resources.  It was shown that for uncorrelated sources, a network utilization 
  of 0.8 is achievable with minimal cell loss (0.5 for correlated sources). For 
  congestion control at the call level, a histogram-based traffic descriptor 
  and call admission policy was proposed. 
 
  Technical assessments were carried out for Telops on the technical 
  feasibility and complexity of providing (1) remote LAN interconnection 
  service using the Metropolitan Area Network standard, DQDB, and DQDB-based 
  SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service), and (2) interactive video 
  communication services over a DQDB network.  The first study found that 
  whereas SMDS exploits many advantages of DQDB, the lack of reconfiguration 
  capability of the Open Bus access DQDB is a serious concern; it was proposed 
  that where reliability is critical, the Looped Bus topology be provided as an 
  option.  the second study concluded that since neither of the non-Isochronous 
  service capabilities supports bandwidth reservation, it is necessary to 
  employ the Isochronous service capability -- which provides circuit-like 
  transport -- to guarantee quality of service for all real-time video 
  services. 
 
  This project also contributed to the ACORN project on lightwave networks at 
  Columbia University.  ACORN has industry-wide participation and is 
  investigating fully optical networks: stations have tunable transmitters and 
  receivers, and are connected by a passive optical medium.  A fundamental 
  problem associated with connection establishment on a packet by packet basis 
  was investigated in collaboration with staff at Columbia University and BNR. 
  A new hybrid time division multiplexing scheme was proposed and analyzed. 
 
  As part of system design of the advanced intelligent network (AIN) testbed, a 
  number of performance/architectural studies were carried out.  In particular, 
  the performance impact of introducing AIN service on the GTD-5 and the PAP (a 
  pre-adjunct-processor in the AIN testbed) was analyzed, using a network of 
  queues model.  Preliminary results indicate that for 20% AIN penetration, 
  system performance is only marginally affected, and an effective bandwidth of 
  1 to 2 Mb/s is sufficient for the switch-adjunct interface.

                    == Statistical Methods in Reliability == 
                             == GTE Project 421 == 
 
 
  The objective of this project was to develop tools applicable to 
  understanding and assessing the reliability of elements of telecommunications 
  systems. Research problems in statistical inference and reliability modeling 
  related to the nature of data obtainable from specific activities or systems 
  used in telephone operations were addressed. 
 
  Software previously delivered to Telephone Operations for monitoring the 
  speed of answer objective in customer contact offices was enhanced.  It 
  execute statistical tests to determine whether performance is as expected 
  after each 15-minute period and to identify some possible causes for poor 
  performance.  The enhanced version completed execution for large numbers of 
  incoming calls in 15 min.  Additionally, in support of force management, it 
  was determined that the software currently used in other customer contact 
  offices to generate capacity tables contains some errors.  The project team 
  delivered the rewritten software, but did not test to determine whether the 
  model is valid.  Simulation studies indicated that there are significant 
  differences in the number of service representatives required when the 
  model's service time distribution is invalid.  Techniques were outlined for 
  analyzing data provided by the Rockwell-Collins Agent Information Reports to 
  make inferences regarding customers' speed of answer tolerance. 
 
  Evaluation of AT&T's bill verification system was completed.  A sampling 
  scheme, statistical analyses, and graphics are used by AT&T to verify access 
  billing by the LECs.  The system was reviewed, and formulae were derived and 
  verified.  the system was found to use statistically correct methodology and 
  to be objective, favoring neither AT&T nor GTE.  The critique of AT&T's 
  methodology gave GTE managers in Pricing Policy and IXC Services and 
  understanding of the technical details and the information necessary to 
  negotiate with AT&T effectively. 
 
  A proposal was made to replace the use of trouble per hundred lines by an 
  estimate of service availability for assessing the quality of telephone 
  service. 
 
  Collaborating with scientists in the Components Technology Laboratory, the 
  project staff prepared a paper that details the lack of mathematical and 
  statistical rigor in the existing laser diode reliability literature and 
  discusses statistical properties and some aspects of reliability modeling 
  pertinent to laser diodes. 
 
  Templates to be used by all users of the Software through Pictures to print 
  out details of the Process Integration and Automation information model were 
  made, and a program to construct the tree structure of inheritance 
  relationships in the database was written. 
 
  In the more basic statistics research activities, a paper on functions of 
  arrangement-increasing partial ordering was submitted for publication, and a 
  book on parameter estimation in reliability and life span models was 
  reviewed.  Papers on Laplace ordering and its reliability applications and on 
  a piecewise exponential estimator for the survivor function were accepted for 
  publication.

                            This document presents Bellcore's view of the 
                            proposed generic requirements for Synchronous

TR-NWT-001024               Operator Services Systems Generic Requirements 
Issue 1, December 1990      (OSSGR) Revision on Intercept Services. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            This document defines Bellcore's view of proposed 
                            revisions to the intercept requirements currently 
                            contained in the OSSGR.  It includes the following 
                            new intercept service options: customized 
                            announcements, automated split referral, intercept 
                            call completion, and multiple entry 
                            announcements/referrals.  The information contained 
                            expands the intercept database architectures and 
                            address areas where automation (dual-tone 
                            multifrequency and voice recognition) are 
                            appropriate. 
 
                            There are significant changes to the two-stage 
                            signaling scheme for intercept call completion 
                            call, and the generation of two AMA records: one 
                            records the intercept service information; the 
                            other records the call completion information.

SR-NWT-000821               Field Reliability Performance Study Handbook 
Issue 3, December 1990 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            This document presents Bellcore's view of generic 
                            guidelines for conducting Field Reliability 
                            Performance Studies (FRPSs).  An FRPS is a formal, 
                            detailed study of the inservices reliability 
                            performance of a product.  The study is conducted 
                            to identify items that should be considered for 
                            corrective action by the manufacturer or user to 
                            improve product quality. 
 
                            This handbook describes several approaches for 
                            conducting an FRPS.  While it is primarily intended 
                            for Bellcore Client Companies who conduct their own 
                            studies, many of the principles presented are 
                            applicable to any FRPS administered by Bellcore or 
                            telecommunications equipment suppliers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            This document describes the Operations System (OS) 
                            and network element interface elements required to 
                            support testing Integrated Services Digital Network 
                            (ISDN) Basic Rate Access (BRA) circuits when the 
                            testing OS is the Integrated Testing System for 
                            ISDN (ITS-ISDN).  ITS-ISDN is a Bellcore-developed 
                            and supported software system that performs that 
                            data analysis and processing to identify ISDN-BRA 
                            digital subscriber line trouble. 
 
                            This Special Report is intended to clarify the 
                            interface between ITS-ISDN and network element(s), 
                            but does not eliminate the need for compatibility 
                            testing.  It supports ITS-ISDN compatibility 
                            testing.  It supports ITS-ISDN Version 3.0 only,

              == Computer Woes Wrack Phones in East, California == 
            -------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   WASHINGTON -- Service disruptions blamed on computer software plagued 
 millions of telephones in the nation's capital and three nearby states 
 Wednesday, and much of California had similar problems. 
 
   Private homes and business bore the brunt of the disruptions in Washington. 
 
   Bell Atlantic said 6.7 million phone lines in Washington, Maryland, Virginia 
 and parts of West Virginia were hit with disruptions. Most service was 
 restored by Wednesday evening. 
 
   A software glitch disrupted Pacific Bell service in the Los Angeles area at 
 midday Wednesday, interfering with phone calls in much of the 213, 818, 714, 
 and 805 area codes.  Most service was restored by midafternoon.

                  -------------------------------------------- 
 
   LONDON -- Marijuana may help people see in the dark, according to a letter 
 in the scientific journal Nature. 
 
   "Jamaican fishermen, it seems, have an uncanny ability to see in the dark, 
 and cannabis is the magic ingredient," said M.E. West of the University of the 
 West Indies. 
 
   Most Jamaican fishermen smoke marijuana or drink an alcoholic beverage made 
 from the stems and leaves of the plant, he said. 
 
   West said he began conducting research after joining a nighttime fishing 
 expedition.  He was amazed at how the crew navigated without lights because he 
 could see nothing. 
 
  [Editor Note: It is Advised to smoke great amounts not due to Night Vision]

                     ------------------------------------- 
 
   Bills mandating per-call blocking for caller ID are advancing rapidly 
 through both houses of Congress.  Thursday, the caller ID bills were studied 
 and changed--or "marked-up" in legislative parlance--by Senate and House 
 subcommittees.  The next step will be further mark-ups by the parent 
 committees before the bills are sent to the full houses for votes. 
 
   Both bills would require all local exchange carriers to offer free per-call 
 blocking.  But the House bill would apply blocking to names and address. 
 
   Congressional staffers say both bills are expected to be modified further in 
 the parent committees and possibly on the floors of both congressional bodies 
 before final passage.

   Doesn't the advancement of various teleco companies just piss you off? 
 Remember the days when you could blue box safely, fuck you were never around 
 then were you?  Remember the days when they were no such things as codes, all 
 you had to do was scan for dial tones.  Wouldn't it be fun, once again for 
 Hackers/Phreaks to upset the Ma Bell cart, just to see the apples to go a

                       ---------------------------------- 
   American Telephone & Telegraph has asked federal regulators for permission 
 to test a system of "personal" mobile phone that could be used at home and on 
 the street, and relieve crowding on the cellular and regular mobile radio 
 frequencies.  If the Federal Communications Commission allowed the test, AT&T 
 said it would spend three years developing the system, which would allow 
 customers to use the same phone and number wherever they went within a 
 metropolitan area.  AT&T is in the "very early stages" of developing the 
 system.

         -------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
   Job Expenditure Tracking System (JETS) is a new engineering project 
 management system that will become USWC's official capital management tool in 
 July. 
 
   JETS replaces certain job authorization processes in DOPAC, as well as the 
 budgeting functions of the Construction Activity Management Information System 
 (CAMIS) and joins several interelated accounting and capital spending 
 functions. 
 
   JETS is designed to work for its users, bringing faster, more efficient 
 tracking of annual budgets, expenditures and administrative information for 
 capital budget management, while it tracks capital and related maintenance 
 dollars and dates for all classes of plant equipment.  JETS will accomplish 
 this while allowing its users to track forecasted, authorized and actual 
 capital dollars by job -- all within a single system. 
 
   As an important market unit resource, JETS will allow more complete tracking 
 of expenditures related to products and services.  System users will have 
 direct responsibility, following conversion to JETS, for the construction 
 expenditure portion of the corporate books, rather than Accounting or other 
 supported personnel.  JETS also moves several other functions currently done 
 in Accounting back to the users.

                == Pay-Phone Competitors say USWest is Unfair == 
              ---------------------------------------------------- 
 
   USWest Communications treats pay-phone competitors unfairly, an association 
 of pay-phone businesses charges in complaint filed Wednesday with state and 
 federal regulators. 
 
   The Arizona Payphone Association, a group of 30 companies, complained to the 
 state Corporation Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. 
 
   USWest competes with other companies to install pay telephones at business 
 locations where the phones are used. 
 
   The association accuses USWest of unfair competition by charging excessive 
 fees for access to the local phone network that USWest controls, and by 
 offering its own pay-phone service at cut-rate prices. 
 
   USWest has about 20,000 pay phones in Arizona and competitors have about 
 4,000, the association says. 
 
   "We are fed up with USWest using its monopoly... to create an unfair 
 competitive advantage," association President Patrick Kerivan said. 
 
   USWest Communications spokesman Tony Seese-Bieda said that the company's 
 practices are not unfair, and that rates for its pay phones and rates for 
 services to other pay-phone companies have been reviewed and approved by 
 regulators.

   Pacific Bell has announced a new PRI-based ISDN service, and is the first 
 Bell operating company to do so.  The company is calling the new service PRI

 private-facility connection.  Initially, the service will debut in two cities, 
 San Francisco and Los Angeles, with other service "according to demand.  PAC 
 Bell says it expects the greatest demand for the new service to services as 
 WATS, 800, foreign, exchange, and private lines, or that want to use it as a 
 means of interconnecting local area network.  Prices for both the 23B+D and 
 24B packages are $1500 for installation and $545 per month.
