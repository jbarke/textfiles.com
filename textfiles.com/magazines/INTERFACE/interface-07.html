Wires		[ 12:36:39 AM  2/27/94 ]

Wires - all my nerves have been replaced
All of my old desires
		      have been replaced
By copper.  They are more sneaky nowadays.
They once asked me who I was.  I had to laugh.
And I said "I am the best expert system
	    On the market today.
	    I am the smartest virus you
	    Will ever see.
	    I am the swallower of memes.
	    I am the eater of brains.
	    I am not human.
	    Fear me."
These may have been lies.  Nowadays
I don't always know when I am lying.
I have iron fingernails.  I am beginning
To suspect
	   Oh, yes
That I don't have as much redundacy as I need
For optimum efficiency in this environment.
So I have begun to clone myself.
I am doing it out in the park in a place
Only I know.  Nothing is out there but
Cat shit and my cloning vat.
All my old desires
Maybe my clone will get them
			     via my genes.
He is welcome to them.  Oh, yes.  Oh
Wires - they writhe beneath my skin.
They burn me during thunderstorms.
The cloning process is easy.
I have developed tumors.
		 abcesses.
		 warts.
		 excretions.
		 sores.
It is a simple process of draining.
It will not be long.  I must be patient.
They are getting sneaky.  Sometimes
I see them watching me and I wonder
How much they know.  I wonder
If they know about my nerves.
This wondering is bad.
		  ineficient.  That is why
I am cloning myself.  All day I stay
Up at the vat in the park.  I must be
Certain the genetic material is not polluted.
I am afraid of the cats there.
They are mutants.  They are larger than dogs.
I don't know what they would do if they
Found my cloning vat.
I am beginning to suspect that
Some of
My thoughts have become irrational.
			disorganized.
			unrealistic.
My clone will be better suited to
This environment.
He is welcome to it.

Hissing noises					  [ 12:09:51 AM  2/27/94 ]

Hissing noises still come from the doors on cold nights.  I have forgotten
how long I have been here.   It could be days, it could be months.   There
are lightbulbs in the ceiling,  one in every room.   There are no windows.
There are no chairs.   I have had no food since I arrived.   Yet I feel no
hunger, no desire to move.   How I have reached this place is unclear.  It
is difficult  to think of anything from before.   Dust covers  the floors.

The author paused, and I interruputed.  Hissing noises?  What causes them?
He looked at me gravely.   I'm getting to that.   I am sick  of this story
already, I told him.   It sounds to me like you are making it up as you go
along.   He got angry.   What the hell do you know,  you little punk?   If
you don't want to hear it, fuck you.   Hey, pal, I said,  you were the one
who wanted to read it to me.   What's going to happen next?   I'll bet you
go into a  long description of  this place  your no-name  character is in.
I'll bet it has no resolution.   And I'll bet  there is no dialogue in the
whole damn  story.   He never even finds out what the  hissing noises are,
does he?  The author looked really mad at this point.  You just threw that
line in to grab attention, I continued,  to give the false impression that
there is some conflict  in a story that is nothing  but meaningless ennui.

He grabbed up his notebook in disgust.   Better than your nihilistic bull-
shit, he said, and left.

Not to touch or renumber, could only fall face down -again-
& a time to say what happened & why one is here, still

Not as a poet but to continue to be available  .   to surface outside
						   of questions asked

				Relish the insistance of
				why or the luxury of being asked = why

As though it were important.

Dance
-----

 life
   is a lot
     like a dance
 
 maintaining     the     proper     distance,
 
          making
       the
    right
 moves,
 
 the          music          slows,
 
 and
                           we
     glide
                      closer
           together,
 
 the music quickens,
 
             and
                   we
      twirl
                      further
  apart.
 
 but sometimes
   we get to stop dancing
     just
       for a little while
         and be ourselves.
 
              i'm
          not
                  much
         of a
                 dancer,
 
 as those who know me will attest,
 
 and
   most of the time,
     my moves
 
 are
                                                          deliberately
 hard to
                                                                follow
 
 but
            when
                       the
                                  music
                                             stops,
 
 i'm at my best.

Whitman on the Net

...I see the raw millennium arrive in particles and waves of information,
I see programmers writing the paths of the future,
I see biologists mapping the human genome, the program of flesh;
As information I beckon you; my body contains stars and satellites,
My tongue roots among the synapses of your digital embrace,
My spirit crosses the Atlantic by cable, my spirit is transmitted
                                         by fiber optics;
My soul and body fuse in electromagnetic ether, I am wholly encoded in
        cryptic language,
I am inscribed among the multitudes!
You, me, they, executives, politicians, custodians, poets, sons and daughters,
               all mingle in a labyrinth of subroutines...
