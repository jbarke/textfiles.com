                ULTRA # 13 - Breaking into houses - E-Z-N boxes 
                              Written by Drug Lord

   May 11, 1991 
 
   It has been a while since I have written a file, and that is because I 
   couldn't think of anything.  So, I just started remember what kind of 
   stuff I used to do (and still do).  The first thing I will teach you 
   about are E-Z-N boxes. 
 
   An E-Z-N box is a gold colored lock that is put on a house that is for 
   sale.  It is put on there by the real estate agent.  Inside the box is 
   the key to the front door.  The reason why they are put on the door knobs 
   of houses is so that the real estate agents don't have to get the key in 
   in order to show the house.  All the agent has to do is open the box up, 
   get the key out, and open the door for their client.  All real estate 
   agents have a key that opens the E-Z-N box.  Notice the initials of the 
   lock and of course you should be able to figure out the meaning of it. 
   If a house has an E-Z-N box, that means THE HOUSE IS VACANT!  The owner 
   usually gets transferred, or moves into another house, so they take their 
   belongings with them, and move on along. 
 
   With this information you can do several things.  If the house is far 
   away from neighbors, you could always try to break open the box, but I 
   think that it would be a stupid idea because the boxes (locks) are cast 
   iron, and it would take you a hell of a long time to get them open. 
   Since the house is vacant, you can go in through the back.  Check all 
   of the doors around the back of the house, and also check the windows 
   to see whether or not they are locked.  I have found that many real 
   estate agents forget about locking the doors back, etc.  This way you 
   won't have to break a window, draw suspicion, and get the neighbors 
   over there.  Just play it smart and don't throw a big rock at it from 
   far away and make the fucking thing make a loud crash. 
 
   Once you are inside the house, check all of the closets, drawers, etc. 
   Even though the owner has moved, he often times leaves some shit behind 
   to come back for later.  He also doesn't have to worry about getting 
   his stuff stolen because the agent is supposed to be with the client at 
   all times.  Hell, most stoves, refrigerators, and other shit stays as 
   well, so if you feel brave enough to lug it out the back door, then 
   more power to ya.  This is also a great place to party with some of 
   your friends.  Once you are inside, you can unlock a certain bedroom 
   window, so you can keep coming back.  They won't think to check all of 
   the windows in the house.  I don't advise you coming back if you break 
   out the window, because people and neighbors will be watching closer. 
   Of course the night that you break in would be an excellent time to 
   fuck your babe, or just rape a bitch off the street.  Needless to say, 
   this should be done at night.  If you attempt this during the day, then 
   you are just a plain dumb fuck. 
 
   The later at night, the better.  If you go around 10:00 pm or so, then 
   there is still a chance that the real estate agent could show the house 
   therefore causing you some major shit.  This is especially true on the 
   weekends because that is the time when most people go out looking for 
   houses.  So go late at night during the week.  That's my suggestion. 
 
                *-* HOW TO FIND A HOUSE WITH AN E-Z-N BOX *-* 
 
   There are two ways of finding one.  The first way is to drive around to 
   houses that are forsale, and just drive buy and look at the front door 
   knob.  Look for the large gold box hanging from it.  Then, you will know 
   if the house is vacant.  Also, on the FOR SALE sign outside, at the top 
   many agents put a small sign on top of it with just the letters 'E-Z-N' 
   or just 'EZN'. 
 
   Another way is to call up some real estate agents and tell them that you 
   are an agent with 'Century 21' (they are a national company, that is why 
   I chose that name) and tell them that you would like to know if their 
   office has any houses on E-Z-N boxes because one of your clients is in 
   and out of town constantly due to his job, and you need to be able to 
   show the house at a moments notice.  They will usually welcome the 
   opportunity to help you, because they are on commission, and it would 
   be to their advantage to get the house sold.  Try this with all the 
   real estate companies you can locally.  Most companies will have branch 
   offices, so be sure to call the branches as well. 
 
                      *-* OTHER WAYS OF GETTING IN *-* 
 
   After finding a house with an E-Z-N box, you could call up the agent and 
   ask to see it.  Then when you are looking around, simply unlock a window 
   when the agent isn't looking.  Then you come back later that night and 
   open it up to get in. 
 
   And last, but not least, if you have big balls and think that you are 
   sly, you could try to steal the E-Z-N key from the real estate agent. 
   It is NOT flat.  The part that you stick into the lock is a cylinder. 
   Look at an E-Z-N box and you will see what I am talking about.  If 
   you try this method, please e-mail me and let me know.  That would be a 
   really good laugh.  I do believe the first ways are the easiest. 
 
   Well, this concludes another ULTRA file.  See, this isn't just a bunch 
   of bullshit that anyone can think of.  It is something that most people 
   don't know about, therefore I have done my service to you by informing 
   you of E-Z-N boxes.  No other group can kick ass like us.  Later on.
