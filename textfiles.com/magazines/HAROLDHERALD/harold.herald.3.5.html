By HAL PHILLIPS

The people have spoken and, by Jove, they clearly want more!

If, by chance, you've spent the previous six weeks strapped to the 
underside of a Winnebago, you might not realize The Harold Herald and 
its staff have become stupendously famous following a brief mention in 
The Boston Globe, which prompted a call from WCVB-TV in Boston and a 
front-page feature in the Portland Press Herald. 

Carpenters are here this week widening the top halves of doorways. 
Subscription and reprint requests are now being handled via our new 
toll-free number 1-800-BOW-TO-ME.

An elderly, often drunk colleague of mine at The Marlboro Enterprise 
used to bristle when awards - garnered by the newspaper or myself - 
were announced in the publication. I would invariably bury the short 
stories somewhere inconspicuous (usually an inside page) so as to 
avoid the appearance of tasteless self-promotion - a practice that 
drove my pickled colleague to distraction.

"You can't be afraid of self-promotion!" he would bellow, the smell of 
vodka and Marlboro's enveloping anyone within spitting distance. "No 
one's going to do it for you!"

My colleague (see related story) had a keen eye for the obvious - but 
he also had a point.

It was his sound advice that compelled me to send a copy of the Herald 
to the Globe's Alex Beam, who saw fit to mention the newsletter in his 
column of July 20 - apparently a very slow news day. St. Alex gave the 
Herald three lines, naming it the second best self-published 
newsletter in New England behind "Owens: A Newsletter about Gardening 
and Cooking." 

This makes our Herald  the most esteemed self-published, non-cooking & 
gardening publication in New England!

It's amazing what a little self-promotion and a few lines in the Globe 
can do for circulation. We've been swamped with subscription requests 
and Chronicle - a news magazine show produced by Ch. 5 in Boston - has 
shown some interest in doing a "piece." 

The Press Herald then published a front-page feature (and picture!) on 
Tuesday, Aug. 2, another slow news day. For the record, my story 
appeared higher on the page than news of Michael Jackson's marriage to 
Lisa Marie Presley.

"Until two years ago," reporter Ray Routhier wrote, "not a single 
publication could give readers comprehensive, up-to-date information 
about Harold Phillips. But one man came forward to fill this crucial 
void - Harold Phillips."

My old Enterprise editor James O'Reilly got some pretty good ink in 
the Press-Herald story ("Who else could write a newsletter about 
himself and not have everyone throw it away immediately?"), as did the 
lovely Sharon Vandermay (for her timely Limbaugh-bashing) and my mom, 
whose memories of my "unspeakable acts" with vacuum cleaners were 
reprinted and have surely ruined my political career.  

With all this attention, there has been some fear the staff's ego - 
already substantial and nearly unmanageable in size - may now grow out 
of control. Hey, you can count on it!

I'm here to assure you the Herald will continue to provide "All the 
news about Hal that Hal deems fit print" with all the bombast and 
pretension you've come to expect.

Garcon! Caviar, for EVERYONE!


AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR BENEFACTOR
BY HAL PHILLIPS

The Boston Globe doesn't quite know what to do with columnist Alex 
Beam. He sort of discovered The Herald with a brief mention in his 
column, which now appears in the Living/Arts section. However, his 
column has appeared as part of the business section and on the 
editorial page, where the Globe tried to pass him off as a 
conservative. Ha! In any case, his mention of the Herald touched off 
the flood of media attention so, hereafter, he will be known as St. 
Alex. The fortyish Beam chatted with us from the Big House on 
Morrissey Boulevard.

HH: How has reading The Harold Herald changed your life?
AB: Um... It's made me realize what one person with a computer can do 
to make the world of publishing a better place.
HH: That's touching.
AB: Why, thank you.
HH: What is your favorite color?
AB: I know it's not brown because I'm married to a Norwegian and they 
have a predilection for brown... Actually, it's blue.
HH: That's interesting. I've heard you mention your wife before in 
print. I was actually engaged to a Norwegian, but it blew up in my 
face.
AB: Well that was your mistake: Getting engaged to an explosive, 
inanimate object.
HH: When they make the movie of your life, who will play you?
AB: In my published-but-never-read-by-the-public novel, I note that I 
bear an incredible resemblance to George Segal, or a young Richard 
Dreyfus - the American Graffiti Richard Dreyfus. Either could be 
recruited to play the mature Alex Beam.
HH: Name your least favorite cartoon character?
AB: I don't like Ren and Stimpy.
HH: Why?!?
AB: Because they're really bad, really violent and they should be done 
away with. And their creator should be shot in the head. But I love 
Beavis and Butthead.
HH: I won't even touch that incongruity.
AB: Thank you.
HH: Complete the following sentence: "Dip me in honey and 
throw me to the ...
AB: Bees.
HH: Boring.
AB: Yeah, that is boring.
HH: If you were a head of lettuce, what variety would you be?
AB: Iceberg.
HH: Complete the following sentences: The Boston Globe would be a 
better paper if...
AB: Um, if my column ran in 20-point type on the front page every day.
HH: The Boston Herald would be a better paper if... 
AB: If my column ran in 20-point type on the front page every day.
HH: If The Harold Herald weren't flawless, what might improve it?
AB: I think the occasional serendipitous error would be seen as such 
an incredible anomaly, it would be viewed as pleasurable by readers 
accustomed to such excellence.
HH: What was the first album you ever purchased with your own money?
AB: Rubber Soul.
HH: What type of car do you drive? 
AB: A little Jap job. Cheapo Honda Civic.
HH: Regular unleaded or premium unleaded?
AB: For the Honda, regular. For the Dodge van, premium. When you get 
to be my age, you worry about engine wear.
HH: Where were you when Apollo landed on the lunar surface?
AB: Well, that's a trick question. I was in Leningrad reading it on 
the back page of Pravda.
HH: Honestly?
AB: It's true.
HH: Did you ever contact the KGB whilst in Leningrad.
AB: Every day.
HH: Do you consider yourself a Baby Boomer?
AB: I've researched the topic and yes, I am.
HH: What went wrong with you people anyway?
AB: Baby Boomers have ruined everything. They have destroyed the 
world. They're self-obsessed. Their obsession with the past is very 
dangerous. I saw the other day that nostalgia is a very minor emotion. 
If ants had emotion, they would have nostalgia. It's the elixir, the 
balm of the small mind. 


Retrospection gone awry: Baby Boomers
mark moon landing with trademark cant

BY HAL PHILLIPS

Okay, I admit it. I haven't the faintest clue as to what I was doing 
or where I was that July evening when messrs. Armstrong & Aldrin set 
the standard for political one-upsmanship by setting foot on the lunar 
surface. I'm sorry, but I was not yet five years old during the summer 
of '69 when Americans huddled before black & white Philcos and 
listened to Walter Cronkite verbalize their own sense of wonder... As 
best I can surmise, I was either digging my way underneath the 
backyard fence or blissfully sacked out atop my rubber sheet. 

However, having endured the avalanche of news coverage marking the 
event's 25th anniversary, I could surely conjure a false memory and 
join in the mass catharsis, contrived rot that it is.

"Where were you when Apollo landed?"

"Oh, I was still at Antioch. I remember stocking the microbus, about 
to leave for Woodstock, when Mara called me inside. We sat in front of 
the TV, ate some mushrooms and complained about Nixon... and the army. 
Then we played some Donovan and tried to agree on our mantra for the 
weekend."

"Wow, that's great... Hey, how are things at Morgan Stanley?"

Where were you when Bobby Kennedy was shot? You were at Monterey, 
weren't you? Remember when we got brained outside the convention in 
Chicago? 

These are questions Baby Boomers still ask each other, over and over 
again, usually at cocktail parties thrown by investment houses 
somewhere in mid-town Manhattan. The moon landing is especially good 
fodder because its foundation was laid by the oft-recalled President 
Kennedy, the single greatest beneficiary of this intense need for 
Boomers to explore their collective memory.

The lunar expedition, or rather the 25th anniversary thereof, is 
merely the latest example the Boomers' superannuated nostalgia - made 
all the more ironic by the generation's complete disinterest in 
further space exploration. These are the people who castigated 
American capitalism, then bought Saabs and now summer in Bar Harbor; 
the people who remember the Apollo landing as a timeless example of 
American will and know-how, then pointedly ask what purpose the 
Shuttle serves.

Despite their vast capacity for contradiction and hypocrisy, Boomers 
cling to these memories - and the ideals they once represented - 
because they can't bear to look forward. 

Boomers are obsessed with nostalgia because they're afraid to imagine 
where in hell they'll take the country next. Responsible as they are 
for the 1970s and '80s, Boomers are content - nay, obsessed with 
idealization of the '60s, that period before they fucked up the 
country and compromised everything for which they had presumably 
stood.

The 25th anniversary of the lunar landing is just the latest in what 
has been a nauseating string of '60s pop culture memorials, 
orchestrated by Boomers now in control of the nation's media outlets. 
And they're not done yet!

Did you enjoy Dan Rather's live report from Woodstock II? Well, get 
ready for Katie Couric on location at the Cambodian border, marking 
Nixon's clandestine bombings; Joan Lunden, a tear in her eye, wishing 
you "Good Morning" from Paris beside Jim Morrison's grave; Peter 
Jennings standing in the Rose Garden, pointing to the spot where Nixon 
waved goodbye (With all due respect to the recently aired BBC 
documentary, the U.S. retrospective will take place in 1999, the 25th 
anniversary of Watergate's unsavory resolution when Boomers finally 
ascended and their parents grudgingly stepped aside). 

Mercifully, the deluge will likely stop there because, as we've 
discussed, Boomers would sooner trade in their Dockers than relive 
post-1974 America. Too painful. Too revealing of their own hypocrisy. 
There will be no anniversary celebrations of Reagan America because 
all the ex-hippies would rather not discuss why they voted for him, 
why they worked on Wall Street, why they started acting like their 
parents had.

Yes, by 1999, the 25-year retrospectives will give way to 30- and 35-
year retrospectives - and to a potentially larger obsession: The 
institutional worry over their sullen, slacking children, those of us 
in Generation X. 

It's possible the Boomers are right about us. Can a generation whose 
only communal memory is the Challenger Disaster possibly carry on the 
American Dream?

A valid question, but here's a better one: Will the Baby Boomers ever 
realize what Generation X has already grasped - namely, that Boomers 
boned and gutted the Dream long ago?

Doubtful. Retrospection is one thing; introspection quite another.



BOB PRYOR: SOME GUY YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
By MARK SULLIVAN

It could be said that white-haired sports scribe Bob Pryor played Yoda 
to Hal Phillips during Hal's early days as sports editor at the 
Marlboro Enterprise, in the same way it could be said Dennis the 
Menace played Yoda to Mr. Wilson. 

The son of a former Ziegfield Follies Girl who was herself once 
publisher of the paper, Bob Pryor - schoolboy sports maven, golf guru 
and devotee of Marlboro tavern society - spent decades at the 
Enterprise, publishing it, editing it, then carrying on as a sports 
reporter and columnist when it passed from his family's hands to chain 
ownership. 

By the time Hal inherited him, Bob, in his early ’60s, was a golf-
panted, quirkily opinionated, oft-pixilated institution at the 
Enterprise: He was a fount of information about Marlboro, about the 
actual number of Hills on which the so-called Highland City was built, 
about the Marlboro mayor in the 1940s who drowned himself in Lake 
Williams, about former Red Sox player Steve Lyons' father, Itchy, from 
neighboring Hudson.

Of convivial bent, Bob, to Hal's chagrin, would go missing one or two 
times a night, typically to Kennedy's pub across the street where, Bob 
explained, they knew how to prepare the special fish on his diet. He 
was a reigning fixture at the news staff's after-work haunt, Sully's 
First Edition Pub, where a drink was named after him - the Pryor 
Special, a zombie-size glass of straight vodka beside a tumbler of ice 
water. 

Bob favored colorful polyester pants from the links and wore his white 
hair in a spit curl that made him look, in the photo above his 
newspaper column, like a sexagenarian Kewpie doll. Extended periods of 
silence in Bob's corner of the newsroom would inevitably be broken out 
of nowhere by a Tourette-like "Yawwwp!," or  a whimsical "HHmmmm!"

As a Braintree, Mass. schoolboy playing basketball in the old Tech 
Tourney at the Boston Garden in the early 1940s, Bob recalls, he was 
described in the Globe sports-page account as "sagacious." Bob's 
sagacity extends to other areas, as well. In a recent phone interview, 
he held forth on a variety of subjects, among them:

Woodstock II: "My opinion of Woodstock: It's a naked drunk in the 
woods. If that's what today's young people like for fun and 
recreation, I'm glad I brought my three up differently."

The Baseball Strike: "I can say it in one word: Greed. How can you 
collect $1.2 million whether you're on the field or on the bench? On 
the road you have your meals paid for you. You get your transportation 
paid for you, your insurance paid for you, your accommodations paid 
for you. These guys are looking for more, more more... If they want to 
be self-employed, they should take up the game of golf, where if you 
don't win, you eat hot dogs."

On the Caning of Teen Vandal Michael Fay in Singapore: "He doesn't 
need a smack on the bum - he needs psychological therapy. I don't 
think a smack on the bum is going to help this kid."

On Worthy Candidates for Caning here in the States: "I know a lot of 
politicians who deserve it. Ted Kennedy, for one. I'd like to cane 
[House Speaker Tom] Foley. Hilary ought to get two of them: one 
tonight, another tomorrow night."

On AIDS: "I found out today from a doctor that bleach can kill AIDS. I 
was amazed! How do you take bleach. That would clean you out!"

On the Late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: "Jackie was not what everyone 
thinks she was. It was not Camelot behind the scenes.... Way back when 
Jack was running for Senator, he stopped by the old Enterprise office 
on Liberty Street. In he came with her. This was an old building, but 
we got the paper out every day. She walked in, looked around and said, 
'This is a newspaper?'

"Jack said: 'Back in the car!'

"That doesn't mean she was a bad lady. I think she was a spoiled 
person... When she married the Greek, was that love? That was a 
business arrangement. Her whole life was a business arrangement. She 
ran down the beach in the nude. Hey, that was her thing. I didn't 
glorify her."



NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND
BY HAL PHILLIPS

Several sister publications have come in from the cold, that is say 
they have emerged from the murky self-publishing landscape and somehow 
landed in The Herald letter bin. Most found their way to Portland as 
result of our recent press, though one seems to suffer from a pre-
existing condition.

... You'll notice the good-hearted Herald staff, to this point, has 
avoided mention of imitation and its relation to flattery - to say 
nothing of plagiarism, copyright law and respect for the intrinsic 
value of intellectual property. Suffice to say, these interloping 
editors are shameless in their use of 8.5- by 11-inch paper and the 
English language, both of which are Herald trademarks... One of these 
shameless knockoffs actually had the nerve to use italics as vehicles 
for emphasis! Why, The Herald practically invented the practice!

In any case, let us take a quick, objective look at each of these, 
these... HIJACKERS! 

• "Owens: A Newsletter about Gardening and Cooking" is just that. 
Originating from Newton, Mass., Owens is published as an adjunct to a 
gardening establishment there. At eight pages, the newsletter contains 
expected features like recipes, gardening advice and listings of local 
services & catalogs. Owens is well written, informative and pretty 
clever: To sit and look at your garden with a glass of beer or iced 
tea in your hand might seem like idleness. This practice can be 
dignified by calling it "on-site planning."  Unexpected and less-
inspired are the newsletter’s offbeat stories. One Owen’s contributor 
spent four pages in painstaking character study of three women he sees 
socially. Sorta boring. Readers may remember that Owen’s took first 
place in the Globe’s ranking of self-published newsletters (The Herald 
finished second). Staff members here at The Herald have been outwardly 
gracious about the snub. Privately, the five words most frequently 
used to describe the voting process have been "fucking travesty of 
justice man..."

• "Epiphanies in P Major" is published out of Portland, Maine, by 
Roger Dutton, who either took too many philosophy courses at school, 
or not nearly enough. Lots of esoteric discussion here, under 
recurring headlines like "The Self Absorptions of Salesmanship," 
"Therapy and the Pendulum," "A Reaction to Antonin Artaud" and "The 
Existential i." Whoa. Heroic archetypes meticulously explored through 
the writing of Campbell, Sartre and Morrison (that’s right, Jim) 
interspersed with healthy portions of my all-time fave, poetry. It 
seems as though Roger did his best to include all the things I hate 
most. Not his fault really. Mine alone.

• Adrian Praeter, one of my college roommates in London, recently 
weighed in with "Adrian’s Oracle," published (rather crudely, I might 
add) with financial assistance from fictional sponsor Jiffy Condoms, 
whose motto is "Get it on in a Jiffy" - an ironic advertising 
relationship considering Adrian’s sexual tag line, "Finished in a 
Jiffy." In any case, Adrian is an actor so when he isn’t doing odd 
jobs, he has a good deal of time on his hands. A large portion of the 
publication (a.k.a. The Orifice) is dedicated to deftly taking the 
piss out of me, the world of self-publishing in general, and The 
Harold Herald in particular. As an Englishman - embittered by his 
country’s tragic plunge into oblivion - Praeter’s anti-American 
carping is to be expected and, well, pitied. Sad really. He is, 
nonetheless, quite a clever boy. For example:

An actual letter from Adrian’s bank manager (and the Ginger Nob’s 
reply - not, incidentally, "Dear Fascist Bullyboy, Give me some money 
you bastard...) are set against lively faux letters, like this one: 
Dear (No madame, it’s not a third leg) Praeter: Thought I’d just touch 
base and fill you in on the details. Well, what about old Henry huh? 
You know, our old alumni... alumnut... aluunni... tit... arsehole, 
arrium - sure we all know him, so everybody’s interested right? 

Horoscopes: Virgo - Stop! Read no further. Go to your room, get back 
into bed and stay there! Go now! ... Has he gone? Good. 
Capricorn - Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... no honestly, you’ll be 
fine. 

Advice: Dear Auntie Ada, I have recently been dumped by my boyfriend 
A****N. What he doesn’t know is that I have a very infectious form of 
genital herpes. I was going to tell him but I couldn’t be bothered. Do 
you think I am being selfish? Yours slyly, X, London. 

Ada Expostulates: Selfish? You? Nooo... You bitch! You sodding tart! 
How the hell could you do such a thing to such a genuinely nice, 
sincere, loving bloke?

Personal ads: Marlies and Agnetta, 21 & 22 respectively, seek slightly 
older man for lessons and fun. Name must begin with "A". 071 443 5899.

International News in Brief: "Shock result in USA presidential 
election. Young English actor elected on a very liberal ticket. Stand 
by for further details."

• The Highly Esteemed Howl is published by a pair of 14-year-olds who 
live right here in Portland. So let me say, before I teach the little 
fucks a journalism lesson they’ll never forget, that I am truly moved 
by their literary pluck and plain ol’ enterprising spirit. Actually, 
without the aid of desktop publishing, Eli & Eli have put together an 
interesting book with good stunts, like the recently concluded "I’m an 
Infringer" contest that allowed readers to transgress copyright laws 
by sending in a good newspaper comic and printing it in the Howl. Of 
course, the winner chose Garfield, which is part of the problem 
here... Hey! They’re 14! Cut ’em some slack! 

Some heavy Beatle worship on Elise’s Page spun off into this bit: 
Woodstock ‘94: Of course, it isn’t going to be half as cool as the 
original Woodstock, and there will probably be a lot more drugs, and 
it will be violent, and, uh, well, 1994 just is not the summer of 
love!" How’s that for Boomer envy...Wonder where they picked that up? 
"They don’t learn these things on the streets..."


WHY NOT TAKE IN A MOVIE? GLAD YOU ASKED...
By DAVID M. ROSE, Ph.D.
Cinema Critic Pro Tem

I’m not a big movie person; in the past year I’ve seen two: Mrs. 
Doubtfire (fluff) and David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia (four-odd hours 
of absolute bliss). With a record like this, I would not presume to 
tell anyone which movies they should see. However, after careful 
consideration of this summer’s offerings, I believe I am uniquely 
qualified to tell you which movies NOT to see.

The Flintstones: Say what you like about Hollywood, this movie proves 
its creative minds are not afraid to try new things. Imagine taking an 
old television show, and making it into a movie! The casting here is 
particularly impressive: the lead role of Fred Flintstone, a fat 
simpleton, is played by John Goodman, who is undeniably fat and 
simple. Before you go see this one, ask yourself two questions: First, 
how likely is it the movie will be better than the TV show? Second, 
how good was the TV show? Case closed.

The Mask: Why is Jim Carrey famous? He started out as The White guy on 
In Living Color, and he was about as funny as Garrett Morris playing 
The Black Guy on the first couple seasons of Saturday Night Live. 
Carrey’s only other credit of note: title role in Ace Ventura, Pet 
Detective. No, I haven’t seen it, but how can a movie with this title 
be good? With this resume, suddenly he’s a superstar, hailed as "the 
new Jerry Lewis." With the exception of a few demented Frenchmen, has 
anyone been clamoring for the old Jerry Lewis? Another problem with 
this movie is the emphasis that has been placed on its special 
effects. Lookit: Jurassic Park proved the kids at Industrial Light and 
Magic, given enough cash, can do anything they want to do as far as 
special effects are concerned. Now that this fact has been 
established, there is no reason to be impressed by special effects. 
Finally, there is already a movie called Mask, and it stars Cher and a 
sort of malformed Danny Bonaduce*. I do not want to relive that 
experience.

The Little Rascals: Help me, lord.
 
Forrest Gump: First, this movie has already been made twice before. 
The first time it was called Being There, and the second time is was 
called Zelig. Of course, the special effects are much more 
sophisticated that those used in Zelig but, again, special effects are 
just a matter of how much money you have to spend. The biggest reason 
I will never see this movie is that I have seen the commercials on TV 
and I cannot sit for two hours listening to Tom Hanks talk like Deputy 
Dawg on Quaaludes. And I like Deputy Dawg.

The Lion King: Walt Disney is the purest manifestation of evil on this 
Earth, and all Disney productions are pure shit. The most inane Warner 
Bros. cartoon (probably one of the 15 billion baby kangaroo ones) is 
so intellectually and artistically superior to the best Disney cartoon 
it makes me positively woozy. If you have children, and if they beg 
you to see this movie, give them heroin instead.

physically deformed yet incredibly well-adjusted son, traveled from 
West Coast campsite to West Coast campsite with her various multiple-
tattoo boyfriends. And ya’ know, those bikers accepted Cher’s bulbous-
faced son without prejudice. It was touching - Ed.)



LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

	Well, thanks to the recent media firestorm, the mailbag is full 
this month as never before.  Interesting, though; nary a letter from 
our electronic audience.  Lets hear some chatter out there, people.  
Letters, submissions, queries, potshots, etc. can be directed to

To the Editor:

Well, now that The Herald has been blazoned across the front page of 
the
Portland Press-Herald, featured in the Boston Globe, and open to 
anyone with Internet access, I suppose all that is left is to go the 
way of Kurt Cobain, who eschewed the fame he attained. (If he hated 
success so much, why did he keep performing in public? Asshole.) 

Please, for the sake of your readers, assign the story of your suicide 
in advance so that it will be captured in print. Should you decide to 
issue press passes to the event itself, count me out. I won’t be party 
to these publicity stunts.
Regretfully,
Alison Harris
Cumberland, Maine

Ed. I assure you, madame, there will be no eschewing of fame from 
these offices. But while I'm contemplating my own mortality, despite 
your protestations, the story is yours.

Dear Mr. Phillips,

I read about you in the paper the other day, but since you obviously 
have a better press agent than I do, you probably did not read about 
me in the paper.

My name is Elise (not Elsie) Adams, and I am the founder of a lovely 
little publication called the Highly Esteemed Howl. I have been doing 
the paper for a little over a year, and have 100 less subscribers (or 
whatever you wish to call them) than you do, but hey, I try.

I enclosed the latest issue of the Howl (August issue) . I hope you 
enjoy it. Made by a couple of 14-year-olds, its the best issue in a 
while (doing a magazine during an attack of mood swings is not 
advisable). I admit that two entire pages for Eli & Eli is a bit much 
for them, but Sage backed out of his astrology forecast at the last 
minute.

I was hoping, if you readily agree of course, that perhaps we could 
trade - one year of the Howl for you and six months of the Harold 
Herald for me? (The HH is two pages longer than the average Howl).

Don’t worry about paying for the Howl. Since the Herald is free, The 
Howl will be, too. After all this is a trade. The reason that the Howl 
needs to be paid for by everyone except those named Harold, is the 
fact that I’m 14, do not have a job, and somebody has to pay for the 
stamps.

writer, distributor, publisher

Ed. Kid, you got yourself a deal. Actually, the Howl is well ahead of 
the Herald in some aspects of the printing process, namely, using both 
sides of the paper.

Dear Mr. Phillips,

While in Maine last month on a three-week New England vacation, I was 
fortunate enough to read the news story in the daily newspaper 
[Portland Press-Herald] about your individual newspaper. I was 
captivated because it was very nearly the same thing I had done last 
year after a two-week writing workshop at Bennington College. There 
were a dozen of us at Bennington studying non-fiction writing under 
Sven Birkerts, a published essayist and English professor. We 
established such a bond that we attempted to keep together through a 
newsletter, which I undertook to edit. The idea was they would write 
me and I, in turn, would edit their news for the whole group. To prime 
the pump, I started putting out a weekly newsletter about what I was 
doing. Sven commented that I had the best documented life since Samuel 
Johnson. 

Letters from the others dwindled, and although it was tremendous fun 
writing it, I finally reached the realization that nobody out there 
was listening to what I was saying. I’m afraid the paid subscription 
does more than pay for postage and printing; it is a vote of 
confidence and interest. I suspended publication.

I would greatly appreciate receiving a copy of The Harold Herald. If 
you have discovered the secret of writing non-fiction that sustains 
interest week after week or month after month, I need to learn from 
you.
Wayne Boyce, editor
The Stream of History
Newport, Ark.
Ed. I don't yet charge for subscriptions, so what you can learn from 
me remains to be seen. The secret to sustaining interest with non-
fiction, it seems to me, is the secret of newspaper column writing. 
And the secret to column writing, as I see it, is not giving a 
tinker’s cuss what people do with their votes of confidence. Not 
giving a shit makes it easier to grab a reader by the throat. Until 
that happens, send it to them whether they want it or not. There - 
take that to your writer’s workshop and discuss it. 


Dear Harold,
Could you enroll me as a subscriber? My qualifications: I am a 
Wesleyan grad (‘63); I have one foot in Maine (Wiscasset home); I am 
opinionated in weird ways - for example, I am a strong proponent of 
television violence. Hard to beat that. 
Further qualification: I will pay money. How much?
Jib Fowles, Ph.D
professor, media studies
University of Houston

Ed. Whoa, media studies. They don't teach that at Wesleyan, my fine 
friend. Good thing you're employed by an institution unhindered by the 
principles of liberal arts education. But Dr. Fowles is okay. He sent 
me a buck. On our scale, that’s worth a lifetime membership. 


By HAL PHILLIPS

NANTUCKET, Mass. - The splendid Messinger residence here in sparsely 
populated Madaket, wedged in the island's southeast corner, features a 
stupendous porch that nearly encircles the shingled, two story 
structure. 

Just beyond an open field teaming with stands of love grass, the ocean 
can be seen - and heard. With nothing to quell its momentum between 
here and Bermuda, the heaving Atlantic slaps the sandy shoreline, 
providing porchsitters a continuous, briny overture of cacophonous but 
nevertheless soothing tones.

Hidden from the revelers - around one corner of the porch - lay would-
be groom Tim Dibble, his soft groans drowned out by the crashing surf. 
For two days he gamely indulged himself and friends by downing 
repeated libations and deflecting other drinking schemes with 
customary élan. 

Dibble had escaped Night I of this bachelor weekend (July 22-23), but 
his luck ran out at 11:34 p.m. on Night II.

After much prodding from yours truly, Dibble finally listened to the 
better angels of his nature before spewing them over porch's edge. 
Three feet from his preferred spot of expectoration, Dibble gracefully 
laid himself down, his nose and forehead there to break the fall. 
Catatonic, his now-fetal form lay half on the porch, half inside.

As Dibble would have wished, guests resumed the business of partying, 
periodically checking on their fallen hero to make sure he was 
breathing. "Trap-her" John McIntyre, M.D. returned from one visit and 
assured those gathered that Dibble's listless demeanor was nothing to 
worry about.

"His rectal tone is normal," said the good doctor.

•••

The end, for Dibble, was swift if not painless. He was in fine spirits 
at 11 p.m. that Saturday night, despite having absorbed numerous shots 
of tequila, several bong hits and a lobster/clam dinner. He appeared 
capable of riding out the evening sur porch, yukking it up with his 
substantial coterie of friends.

But fate and friendship intervened. Ringleader Allan Jones soon 
proposed a pair of cement mixers (shots of different liquors, poured 
independently and held in one's mouth, shaken about, then swallowed) 
for Tim Dibble and Ben Taylor. Herr Dibble responded well, as did the 
Mount Desert Islander Taylor. 

But just then, fellow MDI native and Wesleyan grad David MacDonald 
took the opportunity to make a touching, albeit devastating gesture: 
Single-malt scotch whiskey and tacky Maine crafts! 

By Jupiter, a truly devilish combination!

Mac first presented the fast-fading groom-to-be a hologram picture of 
a clipper ship in choppy seas, explaining how it symbolized the young 
Dibble before he agreed to marry. Mesmerized by the ever-shifting 
waves, Dibble hunched ever so slightly and began to breath heavily.

"Bad timing," Dibble muttered under his breath.

Next MacDonald presented Dibble a picture of two cuddly kittens 
painted on a piece of wood, symbolizing the serene union of Tim and 
his betrothed, Maureen Holland. Despite the manly nature of those in 
attendance many a tear was shed, so cute were the wood-bound kittens.

Unfortunately, Dibble's head was now in his hands and would remain 
there for the duration of his waking evening, which is to say, about 
10 minutes.

MacDonald repeatedly offered the would-be groom a shot of single-malt. 
Rudely, I thought, Dibble refused. The bride's brother then invited 
Dibble to perform with him three-way cement mixer consisting of 
scotch, tequila and clam juice left over from dinner. Wisely, I 
thought (considering the clam juice), Dibble refused. 

Besides, the end was only moments away.

MORE DIBBLE
By HAL PHILLIPS

NANTUCKET, Mass. - An event on the order of Tim Dibble's bachelor 
party should be accorded what we in the trade call a "sidebar," a 
piddling little complementary story that runs alongside a story of 
great magnitude. If Dibble blows chow, it's automatically a story of 
great magnitude. Hence, the need for a piddling story like the one 
printed below, which runs through the moments of hilarity that 
couldn't be addressed in the bigger, more important Dibble story that 
appears elsewhere in this month's Herald.

In any case: 

• This was a first-class bachelor party all the way. No fat strippers 
jumping out of cakes; no raunchy films; no greasing the groom-to-be 
with gobs of vegetable shortening and mounting him from... Like I 
said, real classy. 

Beautiful seaside location. Catered meals. Even a chartered boat for 
the ride from Hyannis to Nantucket. Having flown from Portland, I did 
not experience the excursion. But it was reported that Dibble only 
bared his buttocks to passing boats on two occasions. And Joe Novicki 
only once!

• Pretty much everyone arrived at the Messinger household Friday 
night, and drinking began immediately. At about 1 a.m., a crowd of 10-
15 walked three minutes to the beach where we played some beach soccer 
under an incredibly bright, full moon. Sometime during the game, 
Dibble and Ben Taylor rankled each other - in a nice way, of course. 
The groom-to-be responded by clubbing an unsuspecting Ben over the 
head with an enormous beach toy resembling a Hippity-Hop - only 
bigger. While surf rolled his limp body back and forth in the surf, 
Ben somehow lost his shoes. When he regained consciousness, Ben 
rejoined the game and laid on Dibble one of the nastiest tackles in 
the long history of MBSWNG (Moonlit Beach Soccer With No Goals). The 
next day, Ben remembered nothing of either incident. His shoes were 
never recovered.

• For a brief five-minute period on Friday night, ringleader Allan 
Jones dubbed Paul Buckovitch the "Faux Dibble," and convinced poor 
Paul - with the aid of 30 excitable boys singing the "Ole" song - to 
consume three consecutive tequila shots when everyone, in fact, 
expected Dibble to do the shots. Brilliant! Jones should be commended 
at this time for... oh, why bother.

• Jammin' Jim Jackson picked me up at the airport and shared a few 
libations with me at the Rose & Crown, a bar where Jammin' used to 
work during college. After their chartered boat had docked, Dibble or 
Jones were scheduled to stop by the Rose & Crown, pick me up and take 
me to Madaket. After considerable delay, Jones shows up with Dibble, 
who was sporting a bowling ball chained to his ankle (no kidding) and 
a T-shirt that read: "Dip me in honey and feed me to the lesbians"
[Ed. At this time, the staff would like to apologize to all Herald 
readers who happen to be lesbians or bowling enthusiasts. We also 
apologize to people who might know lesbians personally and consider 
them friends. However, apologies to lesbians who bowl - especially 
candlepin - are withheld. That just isn't natural!]

• All weekend, Jones, Novicki, John Cullinane and Dibble took turns 
crapping on each other's girlfriends. Dibble carried the day with 
ease, however, slamming Jones and his significant other, Maria, who is 
actually beyond reproach. While discussing why the Knicks had lost the 
NBA title to the Rockets, Dibble explained: "The Knicks would have won 
if Maria hadn't kept Oakley up all night before Game 7."

• In a quiet moment, Marc Brown and I agreed that, when it came to 
figures from popular culture, Dibble most resembled Sherman from the 
"Sherman and Peabody" cartoons on Bullwinkle. As it happened, I had a 
Sherman and Peabody T-shirt with me for the weekend... Trippy.


OBITUARIES

Lily Vandermay, 1993-1994

Portland, ME - Lily Vandermay, a border collie/spaniel mix who 
liked to chew things up and play on the beach, was hit by a car the 
first week in August.
	
While walking through Deering Oaks Park here, Ms. Lilly bolted after a 
squirrel and into the busy road.  The end was quick and, the 
veterinarian insisted, Ms. Lilly did not suffer.

She was one and a half.

It is with great sadness that we report to Herald readers the untimely 
death of Lilly the Dog, who was first spotted by Sharon Vandermay at a 
Brunswick animal shelter in May 1993.  Legend tells us that Ms. Lilly 
licked Vandermay's hands and promptly rolled over, looking for a rub 
on the stomach.  This would become her trademark.

Like most dogs, Ms. Lilly was not the brightest bulb in the box.  
Indeed, one of Vandermay's gentlemen callers affectionately called her 
"Posty" (as in "dumb as a post") and "Flea bag" (for no particular 
reason).  Yet, even this cat lover was eventually won over by Ms. 
Lilly's good nature and obvious affection for Ms. Vandermay.

Ms. Lilly leaves her mom, Ms. Vandermay; her aunt, Cathy Vlietstra; 
and hundreds of colleagues in Portland's dog subculture who continue 
to roam East End Beach, the West End Cemetery, and Deering Oaks.  In 
lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to the animal 
shelter of your choice.
