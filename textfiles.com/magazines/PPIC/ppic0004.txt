                    How To Fuck With Your School #1...
                         (Non-electronically)

                              By No Name
                        & Some guy who I don't know


Simple Shit First...

Things That Are Very Usefull:

Bubble Gum
Rubber-bands
Crazy Glue
Sand Paper
Screw Drivers (Both Types)
Tape (Heavy Duty)
Matches. :)
Bolt Cutters (Hand Held, The Smallest Ones From Sears)

And Some Other Little I'll Tell Ya About Later.. :)

First.. Locate The Pay Phone.. (Most Schools Have Them)
Find The Yellow And Black Wires (Rip The Cords Out From Beneath Keep Your
Eyes Open For Them.. Cut Them Both.. It'll Allow People To Put Money In,
But They Can't Really Call, Or Get It Back..

Use Screw Driver(s) To Unscrew Things, This Is Only Fun In A Class Changing
Enviroment.. Unscrew Everything, Desks, Faucets, Lockers, Door Handles, Etc.
The Best Thing To Do Is Just Unscrew Things Enough So That When Someone Goes
To Use/Sit/Pull On These Things They Will Break/Come Apart/Etc..

Go To The Bathroom, Make Sure No One Is In There, And Then Use Super Glue On
The Doors, The Toilet Seat (on Top And Underneath). Also Put Super Glue In
The Locks..

Rubberbands- Shoot Them At Everyone, Everywhere, Put Them In Diskdrives
             Along With A Bent Paper Clips Of Course. Place Crazy Glue At
             One End Of Rubber Band, Glue To The Little Metal Thing That
             Sticks Out On The Bathroom Stalls, Then Glue The Other End To
             The Other Side, So That When Someone Opens The Door From The
             Outside, It Swings Back Shut.. :)

Sand Paper- Sand Your Desk, Then Write Graffiti.. It Makes It Harder To Get
            Off, Do The Same To The Paint On The Lockers, Walls, Etc...

Bubble Gum- Chew A Lot Of It, Make Sure Its Sticky, Sometimes If Gum Is To
            Wet, You Can't Get It To Stick, So Rub It Between Your Fingers
            For A Minute Before Placing It Places.. Put It In Girls Hair,
            Under Desks, On Chairs (Especially The Teachers). Stick It To
            The Wall, Make Designs, Etc.. <Think Up Your Own>

Matches- (Or Lighter) Take Roll Of Toilet Paper, And Place It In A Drinking
         Fountain, Use Lighter To Light It, And Run, (its Better If You Add
         Lighter Fluid. Ir Cram The Drains Full Of Gum, And Then Add The
         Lighter Fluid.. Its Great If You Can Pull It Off.. :)

Tape- Tape Everything,lockers/doors/things With Paint/people/Any Thing Else.

LOCKERS:

Complete Guide To Lockers:

Before We Start, If You Are Friends With Counselors That Let You Borrow
Their Keys, Steal The Master For All The Lockers In Your School. You May
Now Ignore The Rest Of This Locker Text.

:=> What You Need
 3/8" Hex Driver
 Adjustable Wrench(es)
 Needlenose Pliers
 Moby Pliers (Vise-Grips Work REAL
              Well!)
 6" Steel Rod Or Small Crow Bar
 Small Standard Screwdriver
 Large Standard Screwdriver
 Phillipshead Screwdriver
 Moderate Size Claw Hammer

:=> Taking Over
 At The Beginning Of Each School Year, There Are A Good Deal Of Unused
Lockers Around The School. If One Of These Is Near Your Next Class, Slap A
Padlock On It; We'll Get Into Putting A School Lock On It Later...
 Every School Has At Least One Designated "Garbage Locker". Find It
(Them), They Can Be Used To Your Advantage!
 If A Locker You Want Already Has An Owner, No Problem! Read The Next
Section For More Information...
 If You Have A Large Suppy Of Padlocks (which Every Locker
Destroyer Has!), Be Sure To Put Them On The Ones That You Want So You'll
Have It Later When We Go To Put A School-issued Lock On It Later.

:=> Getting In
 Now The Real Challenge Begins! The Hardest Part Of All Of This Is
Getting In The Thing In The First Place! But It's Easy If You Know The
Tricks Of The Trade:
> Padlocks (Combination Or Key)
 Here's Where We Get To Use The Crow Bar! Slip It Between The Lock And The
Latch On The Locker, While Going Between The Two Rods Of The Shank.
Apply Serious Downward Force. This Takes 'em Off So Disgustingly Easily.
It's Not Fair! As A Matter Of Fact, We Can Rip Master Key Locks Off With
A Crummy Hex Driver!

> Destroying The Thing
 If You Are So Pissed As To Rip The Lock Off And Take Over By Force, Be
Sure This Is Your Last Resort! You Leave Little Marks On The Paint, But
A Cheap Can Of Canary Yellow Or What Ever Color You Locker May Be Will Take
Care Of That. Get The Crowbar Again. One End Should Fit Between The Dial
And The Door. If Not, Pry It Open A Little With One Of The Screwdrivers.
Rip The Dial Off Without Mercy. The Lock Itself Will Fall Inside The Locker
After The Bolts Snap And Will Be Free For Opening! If You Can Get A New Dial
For The Lock You Ripped Off, Try To Get It On So You Have Another Usable
Lock.

> Going Through The Combination
 Getting In This Way Is Rare, But Welcomed. Spend An Afternoon Wandering The
Halls Looking At The Walls, Ledges, Doors, Around A Lockers Wherever A
Combination Can Be Written Without Being Easily Seen. If You Find One, Try
It Out-CAREFULLY! Once You Get One That Works, Steal It!

> Pennied Lockers
 Now We're Talking REALLY Rare! But These Are Real Easy To Spot. Walk
Around Looking At The Latch. If It Is Sticking Up A Mile Higher Than The
Others, Give It A Tug. Some Of Them Stick That High Naturally Or If The
Locker Is Over-filled, So Watch For Those.

:=> Once You're In
 All Right, You FINALLY Got The Locker Open And The Lock Is Intact.
Look Around. Steal Anything Of Value. Now, Let's Get The Lock, Ok? See
Those Two Nuts Above And Below The Lock On The Inside Of The Door? Get
The 3/8" Hex Driver And Remove Them. Now Grab The Dial And The Lock And
Pull Free From The Door. Try Not To Move The Dial-it's A Real Pain In The
Ass Getting It Back Right! Refasten The Nuts And Take It To New Location,
And Re-install It On The New Locker Repeating The Steps. If The Dial Does
Not Go In At First, Frob With It A While Until It Seats Into The Lock.
Congrats! You Now Have Just Taken Over Your First Locker!

> Ripping Out The Walls!
 If You Are On The Right Side Of A Wall, You Can Remove It With Little
Difficulty And Get Into The Locker Next To Yours. Use The Same Hex Driver
And Unfasten The Nuts Holding It In. Watch Out For The Shelf, Though!

:=> Garbage Lockers
As Mentioned Above, Garbage Lockers Can Be Very Useful. These Usually
Evidant The First 2-3 Months Of School. They Reach Maturity In About 1-6
Months Depending On Use. The Custodians Come And Clean And Disinfect It
Thoroughly, Killing Whatever New Forms Of Life You May Have Developed. They
Then Will Usually Put A School-owned Padlock On It. Now, Scince It's Clean,
And You Know How To Get Padlocks Off, We Say It's Ripe For Picking!
 You Previously Have Been Opening Lockers Seeing If They Are Worth
Conquering, And How Come Across A Trash Locker. Maybe You Contributed An
Unwanted Apple, Someone's Homework, Etc To It. You Suddenly Notice One Day
That The Janitors Have Taken It Over. Immediately, You Snap The Lock Off
And You Have A Nice Clean Locker.

:=> When To Do Your Vandalism
 1. At Lunch
 2. Skip A Period
 3. After School
(1) Possibly Hard To Do. Either No One Is Allowed Around School Or Everyone
    Is Eating At Their Lockers.
(2) May Cause Difficulties. That Is, Unless You Are Already Failing That
    Class.
(3) This Is Great. Join Some Stupid Club And Then Leave Early Everyday.
Now You Have Enough Time To Swipe A Few! You Could Also Get A Job At School
With The Janitors Or As A Techie. Now You Have Lots Of Time When The School
Is Empty And You Have Access To MORE TOOLS!
