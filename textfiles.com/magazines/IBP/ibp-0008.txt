                             => Itemised Billing <=

                              By Citizen Paranoid

                     (And thanks to Telecom for the manuals)

What is Itemised Billing?
-------------------------
What do I mean by call recording?? Well Telecum calls it IDDCCR, or
International Direct Dialling Call Charge Record. They also call it Itemised
Billing. Many of you probably know what it is, but too many beginning hackers
and phreaks ignore it completely... Basically what it does is keeps a record of
all calls going out of a phoneline.These calls are listed in an itemised bill
and give the this
information :
Date of Call
Connection Time
Place
Number Called
Call Duration
Amount Charged
For STD calls they also include the pay rate, and 0055 numbers DON'T record the
place.

When is it used?
----------------
The majority of people will get itemised phone bills. Telecom has 4 exchange
types, Step x Step, Cross Bar, Are - 11 and AXE. Although only Are - 11 and AXE
exchanges can provide itemised billing, nearly all major cities use these
exchanges... to tell if you're on a exchange that can use the, dial a number on
your touchphone. If the phone uses single tones of different pitches to make a
call, it's got itemised billing.
Itemised Billing is standard for ALL numbers on exchanges that can handle it.
It can be disabled, but the phone company still keeps record of the info, they
just don't include it on your bill.

So what?
--------
So Telecom knows every single number you call, for the majority of p/hackers. 
You might think it doesn't matter, they can't use it for anything. If you do
you're kidding youself. If Telecom suspects you of p/hacking, they can check
every single number you've called. They just trace the time that the system
you're hacking was last broken into, and see if you called anything at that
time. If you called straight from your place to the system, they've got you. If
you called via a loop, then they have to check the loop first. After they've
done that, they've got you.  Telecom can and will use this info to sue you. I
know of at least one hacker who got busted on this info alone. Telecom
suspected him of hacking, so when they had a report of a system being hacked,
his was one of the phonelines they checked. He didn't take precautions, and the
last i knew he was be interviewed by the local pigs.

How do you stop it?
-------------------
Well the simplest way is to flog/buy a notebook and phreak from payphones. If
you don't know how to phreak a payphone and can't find out, you're a lamer, so
piss off before you get busted and drag some real p/hackers down with you... I
dunno whether blue boxing fucks this system up or not. At a guess, i'd say they
still get a record of your call if you bluebox, so I wouldn't try unless you
know otherwise.

All Rights Worth Fuck All
All info ripped off Telecom manuals.

A Big thanks to:
Telecom Manual Writers - Thanks guys! All p/hackers should have a copy of the
stuff you write!
