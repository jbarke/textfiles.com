    Yhea, yhea I know you are so excited. Yes a whole nother issue of PuD
    that you can use for credit on your favorite local TFiLE express b0ard.
    So don't bother reading this issue as it like every other issue has no
    real worth anywhere in it so just stop now and get to uploading. That's
    right spread pud but don't read it. Why? Because it's not the K-K@wl
    thing to do. And you couldn't have anyone knowing what a pathetic little
    LaMeR you are, could you? Ohhhh by the way if you know any Internet
    sites that wouldn't mind carrying a few issue let me know...and please
    no secret FSP WaReZ or Y sites.

    Well I have kinda been busy lately. On FIDONet just watching the
    ranting and ravings of some of the more prestigious freaks you
    will ever have the chance to meet. So how do I, the mighty Baph get
    away with posting one Fido without getting tossed off with my
    superb personality? Skill. I know how to flame and get away with
    it...and so will you shortly...[2]
	
    1: Always start the flame. If you start the flame you are in control,
       the other person is the one who must reply, and replies are often 
       seen more than the flame that started it all. The best thing to do 
       is just seek out some innocent person and rag the hell out of them
       ...um NuKE members are really good for this.
    2: Don't use profanity. Believe it or not without the use of profanity
       you can still piss some one off beyond normal extents. It is really
       great when you get them using all kind of profanity back towards 
       you. Why? Cuz they get tossed while your still around...
    3: Put the other person down constantly. It is easy to find someone's
       weakness. Find it and exploit it. It makes for good reading and
       well a 'purty' hardy laugh on your part also.
    4: After you have the person just pissed at you is the time you go
       for the kill. Don't reply to thier messages. Simply go off and
       whine to other people about how offensive they are. Ooops they
       will more than likely get tossed and all the while the conference
       has reached a new level of lowness...

    Example:
     
    Look at the Virus and Virus Info fido conferences, since I was able
    to start posting again about 40 days ago I have degraded the conference
    with the help of a really great comedian [Dale Bue?dion] to some really
    pathetic posting. Virus talk makes up like 60% of all posts as opposed
    to the former 90% The secret? Flame everyone. First the people no one
    likes, like the virus writers with big heads, then next everyone else.
    It works and damn it is fun.[3]
    
    Soooooon how to flame on internet and make people try and kill you!

                     A day in the life of Satan's Mutt

     He wakes up to find that his mom has spit on his face. This of course
 means it time to get up. Goes down to the kitchen to see that his dad is at
 the table pissing in his corn flakes. After eating breakfast, he goes to his
 K-C00L classes at UaH. There he is bumbarded with loogies from those that 
 notice him. Then he reaches class where the teacher whips out his dick and
 proceeds to masterbate in his face. After the classes he goes back home only
 to find that the locks were changed and his parents called the police saying
 that there is a burglar trying to break in. After getting assaulted by the 
 police, he is raped several times by the White Arian Revolt troops. There he 
 gets to learn some of the tricks of the trade that he shows off to 
 Brownstone and the Gate Keeper. Now he's back at home due to the fact he 
 pays rent and is in the basement where he belongs trying to do Demos. Which 
 are rip-offs of others work, but hey, who'll ever know?

ş Superiority.

    Is more than just a state of being is a state of the mind. I am simply
    superior. Plain and simple. I always will be. 

ş NewZ!

    I found my m0m. After all these years...she was amazingly also spending
    quite a bit of time at the csb and through the once mighty Digital 
    Saint I came in contact with her. So we had a lot to talk about, like
    why she kept trying to kill me when I was young and why she gave me up.
    The real truth was horrible! But even I will admit it, yes my father is
    well, er, um none other than Bill Gates ]I[!!!1!. I am so ashamed...but
    hey at least now I know why I got around at such an early age, M0m was
    only like 4 when she had me...

ş Yhea, well...

    Yhea well I hate you to. No, no, no it's true. I do.

ş Egos...

    Boy isn't inflating your own ego great? Well it is. More people should
    do it. Having such a faith and love for yourself is a great feeling,
    there is nothing close. It lasts. It's so damn fullfilling and best of
    all you don't have to buy it dinner and act like you like talking to 
    it.

ş Stevarooooono!

    Ya know someone probably thought that in this PUD I would spend a lot
    of time dissing this little thing he wrote about one of our mild little
    disagrements...but to disapoint him I am not. But I would like to bring
    up one simple fact, Steve. I asked you if you had nothing better to do
    in life than bother me. You said you did. Then how come less than 2 
    hours after our little tiffle you had completed and saved that file for
    the last time? 30 minutes to get home, a while to eat, my, my, my your
    typomatic rate must have been pushed that night, So I believe the correct
    answer was, "No baph I have nothing more to do in life than bother you."

    And to put it simply, you aren't. You don't even get close to sucking,
    your morbid shit on the side of my ragged out tennis shoes. Your vile
    contemptfull piss that sat in the rain in a jar and got diluted to the
    strength of mild water. Your nothing. And you never will be. Face it.
    Do me and the rest of the world a favor and end your pathetic morbid
    charade that you call life. Really. It would be nice for the rest of
