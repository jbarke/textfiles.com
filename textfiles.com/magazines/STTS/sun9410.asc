Welcome to Sunlight Through The Shadows magazine! In this issue, as well
as in the future, STTS will strive to bring you the best in fiction,
poetry, reviews, article, and other assorted reading material.

STTS Magazine has no general "theme" aside from good writing, innovative
concepts, and the unique execution of those concepts.

STTS wouldn't have been possible without the aid, support, and guidance
of three women:

Inez Harrison, publisher of Poetry In Motion newsletter. Her's was the
first electronic magazine I ever laid eyes upon, and also the first such
magazine to publish my work. She's given me advice, and, more
importantly, inspiration.

Lucia Chambers, publisher of Smoke & Mirrors Elec. Magazine and head of
Pen & Brush Network. She gave me advice on running a magazine,
encouragement, and hints as to the kind of people to look for in
writers.

Heather DeRouen, my wife. Listed last here, but always first in my
heart. She's proofread manuscripts, inspired me, listened to me, and,
most importantly, loved me. Never could I find a better woman to live
life by my side, nor a better friend.

Now that that's said and done... Again, welcome to Sunlight Through The
Shadows Magazine! I hope you enjoy it.

        Five years ago I wandered into a video arcade near where I 
worked.  It had been quite some time since I had gone into one, and I
was wondering what had changed.
        There were some very realistic games where people hit one another,
but I had seen their kind before - in lower graphics.  There was a very
fun game involving building a blowing up castles, but that wasn't where
the crowd was.
        I don't remember the name of it.  Some screwy foreign sounding
word.  Guys from all ages, from ten to twenty, were hovering around it,
while a ten-year old played.
        It was some sort of strategic game.  You could move a line around,
filling sections while little flying things tried to kill you.  Not very
original.  In fact, I was sure that I had seen the like before.  And what
was more - it was boring.
        So why were all of these guys hovering around it?  I decided to stay
and watch the adolescent play.  We whipped his little line drawer across the
screen and narrowly won the match.  The screen wavered a bit, and up popped
a scantily clad Asian girl on the screen.  I blinked a few times my brow
knotted.
        Blam.  He went to level two.  Finished it.  Up popped the girl
again.  Then part of her clothing disappeared.  Another level.  More clothes
off.  Until finally the girl was nude.  Then it all started over with
another Asian girl.
        It didn't seep in for a while.  How could it be happening?  A ten
year old was publicly nudifying electronic images for all the world to see.  
Had something changed?  Had congress all taken happy pills and voted in
strange ways?
        I diligently returned day after day to see what would happen.  My
civic duty, of course.  The kids, most far too young, would cluster around
while the owner would spend all his time in his little glass booth counting
money.
        It still seems like a dream.  I remember when Pong came out.  I
actually slapped down money to play the stupid game.  A while back a friend
and I were talking about Generation X.  They are lumped into one big group,
but we saw a line that divided the group like the grand canyon.  It took
us a while to figure it out - but we finally hit the nail on the head.  The
Pong gap.  Okay, everybody who played Pong when it first came out, stand
over there.  Those who missed it - well, you guys are different.
        My father zeroed in on the highest technology - bypassing the Atari
for the Bally Home Entertainment System.  Most of you have never heard of
this marvel of technology.  I think maybe three units were sold before
Bally ran away screaming from the market.  But to put it into perspective,
that Bally machine was to Atari as Sega Genesis was to those old Nintendo
things.
        It had mega hits such as Tennis, which was, well, Pong.  But up to
four people could play at the same time.  Yes, four.  It had four joysticks.
Well, they weren't joysticks.  They looked like pistol handles, with 
triggers.  And a little knob up on top that you could turn left and right.
It was very nice.  Fingers didn't get tired and your thumbs never hurt so
bad you wanted to cut them off to stop the pain.
        The Tennis was really the bottom.  It had a baseball game that had
little men with hands and feet who would run around on the screen.  It
always felt odd pulling the trigger of the gun to swing a bat, but it was
better than pushing a button.  Those old Atari buttons broke too easily.  I
don't know how many friends joysticks I destroyed.
        Further jumping the gun, my father bought me an Odessey.  Few of you
will remember that either.  The key selling point was that it had a
keyboard.  Not that any of the games or cartridges required a keyboard,
but it had a keyboard, none the less.  The company made a program that
so closely resembled Pac-man that Atari sued it and the company floundered
and disappeared from the video game scene.
        But not even my friends Sega Genesis prepared me for that game of
taking off Asiatic women's clothing.  It wasn't a moral issue.  It was the
fact that photo quality graphics were being used in a video game.  An
amazing amount of technology at that time.
        One of the kids' mothers caught wind of the nifty import game
from Singapore, or where ever, and the police hauled the game off.
Distributing pornography to a minor, I think the charge was.
        The kids scattered and went back to playing games full of death and
violence, body parts flying and blood gushing.  But that little pornographic
pinball wizard still haunts my mind.  Around his age, I was playing highly
advanced games like Zevious, with the little red flashing lights, and
was diligently trying to avoid playing Mrs. Pac-man.  But even at that time,
you could still see those old standbys, Pac-man and Space Invaders, lurking
in the corner, suffering from screen burn, but still playable.
        Between that little kid and I lay a ten year gap.  Ten years, and
such tremendous advances in technology.  Now, five years later, they just
strap a CD to the system and get stuff that almost looks like real people
beating the stuffing out of each other.
        What happens in another ten years?  I'm sure playing a game then
will be far more like directing a movie than actual game playing.  Or, 
slap on the virtual reality goggles and motion detectors wand you will be
in the movie.  A decade won't be quite enough time to bring about neural
interfaces, though.  Us old fogies could recognize a video game in ten
years.  Beyond that - well, it will get weird.
        And how about those pinball wizards a decade from now?  I was good
at a couple of games, bringing me brief fame for a second or two.  No where
near as much as the pornographic pinball wizard, though.  It's hard for me
to think how anyone could top that guy.  Perhaps there will a game where
you have to kill everybody on the planet with a banana.  Anyone who could
take out five billion people with a banana would defiantly deserve some
respect - for a minute or two.
        What about the 'real' pinball wizards.  Sorry.  Never did like
that game.  It never had enough balls.

 
 

  The Staff and Contributing Writers of Sunlight Through The Shadows

  The Staff
  ---------

  Joe DeRouen............................Publisher and Editor
  L. Shawn Aiken.........................Assistant Editor   

  Heather DeRouen........................Book Reviews
  Bruce Diamond..........................Movie Reviews
  Tamara.................................House Poet


  Joe DeRouen publishes, edits, and writes for STTS magazine. He's had
  poetry and fiction published in several on-line magazines and a few
  paper publications as well. He's written exactly 1.5 novels, none of
  which, alas, have seen the light of publication. He attends college
  part-time in search of that always-elusive english degree. In his
  spare time, he enjoys reading, running his BBS, collecting music,
  playing with his five cats, singing opera, hunting pseudopods, and
  most importantly spending time with his beautiful wife Heather.

  L. Shawn Aiken dropped out of college when he realized that they  
  couldn't teach him the two things he wanted to do; live successfully,
  and write.  He had to find out these things all by himself on the
  road.  Thus he became a road scholar.  After spending his life hopping
  country to country, state to state, he now feels confident in his
  abilities and is working on his literary career.  His main endevour is
  to become successful in the speculative fiction area, but he enjoys
  writing all forms of literary art.

  Heather DeRouen writes software for the healthcare industry, CoSysOps
  Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS, enjoys playing with her five cats,
  cross-stitching, and reading. Most of all, she enjoys spending time
  with her dapper, charming, witty, and handsome (not to mention modest)
  husband Joe. Heather's help towards editing and proofreading this
  magazine has been immeasurable.

  Bruce Diamond, part-time pseudopod and ruler of a small island chain
  off the coast of Chil‚, spends his time imitating desk lamps when he
  isn't watching and critiquing movies for LIGHTS OUT, his BBS movie
  review publication (now syndicated to over 20 boards).  Recently,
  Bruce became the monthly movie critic for VALLEY REVIEW MAGAZINE,
  published out of Pennsylvania.  LIGHTS OUT, now two years old, is
  available through the Rime or P&B Networks by dropping a note to
  Joe DeRouen, courtesy of Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS.  The
  magazine will soon be available through Fido file request and
  Internet FTP.  In the Dallas area, Bruce's distributor is Jay
  Gaines' BBS AMERICA (214-994-0093).  Bruce is a freelance writer
  and video producer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

  There is very little known about Tamara, and she prefers to let it
  remain that way. She's a woman of mystery and prefers to remain hidden
  in the shadows of the BBS world. (Enigmatic, don't you think?)

  Dale E. Lehman.........................Fiction
  Daniel Sendecki........................Fiction, Poetry
  Louis Turbeville.......................Software Reviews
  Thomas Van Hook........................My View, Music Review


  Ed Davis has been scribbling seriously or has at least enjoyed the
  electronic equivalent, since 1981. Prior to that, his literary efforts
  were confined to whatever scrap paper he could find on a work bench at
  break or lunch time, since he was spending his working hours making
  chips and money in the guise of a Journeyman Machinist.  Married to
  the same lady for 26 years and with two children still hovering
  uncomfortably close to the nest, Ed continues to write down his
  thoughts electronically. Check out the file NEWBOOK.ZIP, available
  from STTS BBS, for more of his work.

  Sean A. Donahue does not have any publishing ties whatsoever.  He has
  written over 4,192 poems.  Only 38 have seen to survive the Mighty
  Morphin Power Rangers.  The time in which normal people say is spare,
  he tries to use to study for school at Texas Tech University.  This is
  Sean's first published poem and he hopes that it is not his last.  He
  has written exactly 428 novels all starting with "It was a dark and
  stormy night."  None ofthem have gotten past the second paragraph.  In
  whatever time he has left, he enjoys reading, riting, and rithmatic. 
  He has an creative writing minor, a history minor, and a Honorary
  Doctorate in B.S. from Bowling Green State University.  He dedicates
  his writing to those who are without love and hope.  And that's no
  B.S. 

  Grant Guenther, sometimes known as J. Guenther, confesses to be from a
  long-lost Martian colony, but in-depth investigations reveals that he
  was born and raised in a small but well-to-do community called
  Hartland in Wisconsin.  A senior, he has written several collections
  of poems, and won many awards from his high school literary magazine,
  including 1st place for poetry and short-short fiction.  He is the
  editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and writes as a humor
  columnist (or at least he thinks so).

  At the tender age of 35, Dale E. Lehman is already a veteran systems
  analyst, father, zookeeper, and rejection slip collector.  He
  specializes in SF, fantasy, and mysteries, with one completed novel
  looking for an agent, four fragmentary novels in progress, and oodles
  of short stories all crammed into a tiny filing cabinet.  With the
  help of his personal editor/reference librarian/wife, he is not only
  supporting a writing habit but also five children, one dog, and a
  wildly fluctuating number of demon cats.  He ap plies any leftover
  time to reading and playing chess--not generally at the sam e time,
  though. 

  Daniel Sendecki is a young, emerging, Canadian writer who lives 
  in Burlington, Ontario.  Currently, Daniel is pursuing his writing 
  interests at home but intends to study literature at McGill 
  University, in Montreal, Quebec.  

  Louis Turbeville currently works as a computer analyst for the Air  
  Force.  He's originally from Hawaii (about an 1/8 Hawaiian <everyone
  seems to ask>) and has a BBA in Management Information Systems from the
  University of Hawaii.  Louis is married and has a two year old son who
  keeps him busy, especially when he wants to sit at the computer and
  write.  His interest in writing was nurtured by his wife, a journalism
  and english major who's yet to be published and holds this very much
  against Louis. <G>  He's had a couple of reviews published on
  WindowsOnLine Review Magazine and hopes to broaden his base of published
  media in the near future. 

  Thomas Van Hook resides in Dallas, where he works as a contract
  employee for the Federal Reserve Automation Services.  Having served
  eight years in the USAF, he is happy to finally be free and able to
  pursue the dreams of his heart.  At the age of 29, he is looking
  forward to many new adventures and experiences within the realms of
  the Elven kind.  He enjoys reading, writing, sports of all kinds, his
  son Corey and the attentions of any Elven women that seem interested
  (not necessarily in that order).  Recently divorced, he is trying to
  restore order and balance to his life without losing what little is
  left of his sanity.

All rights reserved


Tom Wildoner of T&J Software has been kind enough to donate twelve
twenty dollar ($20.00) credits to STTS, good for purchase towards one of
Tom's many great BBS doors!  

The first SysOp each month to call my BBS and send me a (C)omment saying
that s/he agrees to be a dist. site for STTS Magazine *and* post the
STTS 1-page logon screen for at least twelve months wins the prize.
(Being a dist. site costs a SysOp nothing except possibly calling to
download the file each month)

If your BBS is already a dist. site, call and leave me a comment giving
me a general update as to how many people downloaded the latest issue,

QUICK TIPS AND FIXES
by Joe DeRouen


Each month, I'll try to answer at least a few of the many questions that
find their way into my mailbox.  While all questions will receive
answers when appropriate, we can't promise to print all questions.
But keep those cards and letters coming, folks!


Q: I just upgraded to a 14.4k modem.  I changed my baud rates in my
   Procomm Plus dialing directory, but it still won't work.  What did I
   do wrong? 

A: We'll assume you're running a legal version of PcPlus and just
   couldn't find the answer in your manual.  If this isn't the case,
   erase it immediately and download a shareware program like Telix
   or QModem test version and give one of those a try.  As Jay Gaines
   might say; "Pirating software is illegal.  Don't try this in your
   own home."

   But I try never to assume the worst of people, so . .. 

   You need to run PCINSTAL.EXE and choose a new modem.  Preferably
   your exact make and model.  If the program doesn't contain your
   modem, you may need to dial up DataStorm's (the creators of Procomm
   Plus) BBS and download a new version of the file MODEMS.DAT. 
   MODEMS.DAT contains information that PCINSTAL.EXE needs to set up the
   correct initialization string for your modem. 

   DataStorms BBS is (314) 875-0476.  If you can't afford the long
   distance call, I try to keep a current MODEMS.DAT file on my BBS.
   Call and download; the file is free. 

   If your modem still isn't listed, try selecting other 14.4k modems
   that look as generic (ie: Hayes compatible) as possible.  You may
   very well get lucky and hit upon the right one.  If all else fails,
   call DataStorm voice and ask them for the proper initialization
   string for your modem. 


Q: I've been hearing an awfully lot about something called a "Mud."  
   What exactly is a Mud and how do I play one?

A: First of all, MUD stands for (depending upon who you ask) either 
   "Multi-User Dungeon", "Multi-User Dimension", or "Multi-User Domain."
   Dungeon seems to fit better as most of the MUDs are Dungeons and
   Dragons-type orientated role-playing games.

   MUDs are generally all-text games, though a few have rudimentary
   ASCII or ANSI graphics.  The object of most of the games are very
   similar to D&D: kill monsters, accumulate treasure, and gain 
   experience levels.  Some of the better MUDs have complicated mazes,
   traps, and tricks you must find your way through in order to gain
   levels.  Or, in some cases, simply survive.  

   You accomplish this by moving (or, more aptly, moving your avatar
   or character) around a digital world where you interact with 
   sometimes hundreds of other players just like you.  You can 
   role-play magic users, thieves, warriors, priests, and even 
   martial artists.  On some MUDs, you can even design your own 
   description that other players "see" when they examine you.

   MUDs are generally found on the Internet, though other on-line RPG   
   (Role-Playing Games) on non-internet systems can be found as well.

   How do you access MUDs?  Through Telnetting via the Internet.  The
   first thing to do is find a list of MUDs.  (Download MUDLIST.ZIP from
   STTS BBS if nothing else.)  Each mode will have a access node and a
   port number.  (Something like FARSIDE.ATINC.COM 3000)  When the node
   you're using asks where you want to telnet, enter the required
   information and off you go.  Call up your favorite full-access
   internet node, and telnet the night away! 


Q: I'm trying to set up a batch file to execute several other batch
   files and then load up Windows.  After it executes the first 
   batch file (a reminder program) it stops.  I don't understand what
   the problem is.

A: This one's easy.  All you need to do is put the command CALL 
   before each of the batch (.BAT) files you want to execute 
   within your primary batch file.  

   If you don't use CALL, DOS just leaps from the primary batch file to
   the first one you have nested and never goes back.  By doing it this
   way your computer "remembers" that it needs to continue executing the
   original batch file.  You can use the CALL command on as many nested
   batch files as you need. 

   Here's a brief example:

     @ECHO OFF
     PROMPT $P$G
     PATH C:\DOS;D:\QEMM;C:\;F:\SD;C:\TURBO;D:\NORTON;F:\QUOTES
     CALL C:\CALENDAR\CAL.BAT
     CALL C:\DICT\DICT.BAT
     C:\WINDOWS\WIN.EXE   

   In this example, two batch file - CAL.BAT and DICT.BAT - are 
   executed, all without losing the thread of the primary batch
   file.  After those programs run, the batch file will conclude
   by running WIN.EXE and load Windows.            

   As long as you use the CALL command, your nested batch files will 
   work just fine.

It Ain't Over Till It's Over And It's Over Now
             by Thomas Van Hook


        I can vaguely remember the first time I saw a Major League Baseball 
game.  At Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati, Ohio), I got to watch a 
double-header between the Cincinnati Reds and the Montreal Expos.  It was 
the first time that Tony Perez would play against his former teammates on 
the Reds.  On that sunny July afternoon in 1978, I got to see some of the 
greatest players in the game.  Cincinnati had the great Johnny Bench playing 
catcher, the infamous Pete Rose playing third base, and a young 
superstar-in-the-making in Ken Griffey Sr. in the outfield.  Montreal had 
Gary Carter behind the plate, and Tony Perez on first base.  Of these 
players, only Pete Rose will not make the Baseball Hall-Of-Fame, and not 
because he wasn't one of the greatest players the game ever saw.  It was a 
very special time in the life of a 13-year old kid.  My eyes were wide open 
with the awe of the "greats."  There were no "work-stoppages" looming over 
the horizon, no "collective bargaining agreements" to ratify.  But the times 
did change.

        Now, instead of watching Major League Baseball players with a 
reverent awe, I stare at them with a wide-eyed look of shock.  While the 
fans have clung to baseball as a cherished part of their lives, the players 
dismiss it as nothing more than "a job."  The fans have watched game after 
game, knowing that they are watching history-in-the-making that they can 
pass down to their kids by word of mouth.  The players look at each game as 
"another day at the office."  There is no excitement and love for the game 
of baseball in the spirit of the players.  Instead, the spirit of the 
players is driven by a greedy desire of money.  That greed has forced the 
cancellation of the World Series for the first time in ninety years.  Major 
League Baseball is rotting away from the inside.

        The question that is frequently asked of me is:  "What will become 
of baseball?"  I am not sure.  A prolonged strike by the players will result 
in some of the most devastating financial situations for the owners since 
the advent of the "Brotherhood War" in the early 1900s.  Several teams look 
poised for a collapse.  There could be as few as three teams bankrupt at the 
end of a prolonged strike.  There is also the possibility that the next 
elected Congress will break the Anti-Trust exemption that was awarded to 
Major League Baseball by the Supreme Court.  If this does happen, then 
there will be a potential for the creation of a new "Player's League."  
Saddly, the times are mirroring the attitudes and events in the Brotherhood 
War.  The loser in that fiasco was ALL of baseball.  I just wonder how much 
longer the fans are going to put up with the nonsense they are being fed by 
the both sides in this "Baseball War."  There is one thing that is certain.  
Baseball will never be the same once the dust from this fight settles.

        Goodnight baseball, you will be missed.

Halloween - The Prequel
Copyright (c) 1993, Brigid Childs
All rights reserved



                     HALLOWEEN - THE PREQUEL


   Halloween - the word conjures up memories of twilight shivers, running
through the piles of carefully raked leaves to knock timorously at the
neighbors' doors, squeaking out "Trick or treat", and waiting to see which
would be chosen.  Eerie faces glowed and glared, guarding window after window
with candle flame in wildly carved pumpkin.  Tales of terror passed from oldest
to youngest evoked chills on that special night we'd anticipated for weeks.
Halloween was ghosts and goblins and ghoul - and most of all, Halloween was the
season of the witch; silhouetted against the full autumn moon, straddling her
broom this queen of the night rode the darkness of our dreams.  But where did
Halloween come from?

    To the modern witch, Halloween is a serious religious holiday, its roots
reaching back in to shamanistic tradition.  Called Hallows by some pagan
traditions, this is the Celtic New Year, Samhain (pronounced something ike
"sahw-in).  On this night, the Celts and their Druid priests lit bonfires upon
which they symbolically burned the ills and frustrations of the past year.  At
Samhain, which translates from the Celtic as "Summer's End", the Druids counted
their herds and mated their breeding stock for the coming spring.  And Samhain
was the night when the veil between the worlds would part briefly to allow
contract between the living and their dead.

    Many cultures have continued this recognition of their dead. The Japanese
hang paper lanterns on their gates to welcome home the spirits of their
ancestors; similarly the Irish leave candles in their windows toward the same
purpose.  The Egyptians light candles in their cemetaries to guide the dead
back from the City of Osiris.  The Jack o'Lantern of modern Hallows revels was
once a carved turnip used to light both live and dead  celebrants to Samhain
rites.  This is a night to honour and remember those who'd gone before.  While
modern Pagans do not believe in disturbing the departed, on Hallows the spirits
are invited to share our ritual gatherings and whatever voluntary messages may
be communicated are  welcomed.  It's also a night when witches traditionally
practice divination to anticipate the events of the coming year.  Runes, tarot
cards, scrying mirrors, even nuts and apples are Hallows' tools of foreseeing.
(Apples and nuts???)

    Samhain; (Summer's End, remember?) represents the Third Harvest as well.
The Celts pressed cider in this season and collected nuts and the last fruits
and grains for winter; indeed, it was considered unwise to eat foods that had
remained unharvested past Halloween.  Feasting appropriate to the season
included pumpkin, corn, nuts and apples, and servings were offered to the
departed to let them share in this celebration.  The apple is particularly
associated with Samhain and Wicca; cut in half horizontally, it reveals at its
core the five pointed star.  Its flesh nourishes us, yet its seeds contain
deadly cyanide.  Apples were sacred to Hel, the Norse goddes of the Underworld,
and in Celtic myth, Avalon, the Isle of the Blessed, and Tir-Na-Nog, the
Summerland, both homes of the dead, are both depicted as beautiful islands
where apple trees bear fruit all year.  Bobbing for apples, a modern Halloween
game, recalls the pagan traditions associated with the holiday.  The hazel nut
also has long been noted as sacred to the gods as a source of wisdom.  Hazel
nuts are tossed on the Hallows fire by young women attempting to see their
future husbands in the flames.

  Pagans still observe the Old Ways, harming none in their practice of a
religion that interprets the agricultural cycles of the earth for an urbanized
industrial society.  Modern Samhain rituals allow our love for nature and
respect for our ancestors and traditions to surface in a world where such
values are in short supply.  The maske and merriment of Halloween echo the
original festival of harvest and spirits, gently accepting the joy of earlier
times.

  Blessed be and peace be with you - Brigid

 
 
Haunted Verdun Manor

                      HAUNTED VERDUN MANOR


Located in way out of the way Forney Texas, Haunted Verdun Manor at
first seems a bit too far out off the beaten path to travel for a simple
haunted house. First inspections are often wrong, however.

Haunted Verdun Manor is a unique themed haunted house created and
designed by Wolf Studios, a special effects company dedicated to
Disney-like quality and detail. At 7,000 square feet and two stories,
it's the world's largest walk-through haunted house attraction.
Featuring theatrical sets, lighting, and costumes - not to mention
talented actors filling the costumes - it's definitely the place to go
to get your Halloween frights.

In the past, I've really gotten a kick out of the house.  The effects
have been better than any others, and the frights have truly been
chilling.  This year, however, I was very disappointed.

They've added strobe lights to nearly 90% of the house.  The effect is
disconcerting, to be sure, but it's more annoying than it is scary.
Moreover, you can't get a really good look at the monsters and ghouls.
It might as well have been any old neighborhood haunted house rather
than Verdun Manor, and that was disappointing.

Haunted Verdun Manor used to be the best Halloween entertainment you
could find in Dallas.  No longer, at least not this year.  Check it out
in '95 and see if it's improved.


Wolf Studios boasts another attraction - Cassandra's Pandemonium
Carnival. The carnival feature several horror-orientated attraction,
it's prize offering being Cassandra's Labyrinth. (A maze)

It's all a bit pricey - admission into the Manor is $7.00 for adults and
$6.00 for children.  A bit steep, especially with the quality of this
year's offering.

Haunted Verdun Manor and Cassandra's Pandemonium Carnival open October
first and close October 31st. Hours for the attraction are 6:PM to
10:PM Sun., Wed., and Thu., and 6:PM to Midnight on Friday and Saturday.
It's open every day during the last week of October. 

Directions to the attraction are as follows: Take East Highway 80 past
Forney to get off on the County Road 212 exit. Haunted Verdun Manor and
Cassandra's Pandemonium Carnival are at the corner of the south service
road and County Road 212, with parking in the back, off of County Road
212. Call (214) 564-3941 for directions. 

A portion of the proceeds go to the Animal Rehabilitation Center in
Midlothian (another small town in Texas, about 20 minutes from Dallas) a
non-profit group dedicated to caring for injured or abandoned wildlife
for it's eventual release back into the wild. 

 
 
Survey Results
Copyright (c) 1994, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved


Beginning last month, everyone who answered the survey had their
name thrown into a hat for a random drawing.  Each month we'll give away
a prize of some great (or not-so-great) worth by drawing a name out of
the hat.  Everyone who fills out and sends in a survey is eligible!

Oct. 1st was the first such drawing, and Dave Crumb of Chicago,
Illinois was selected to win Cinemark's claymation VGA/Soundblaster game
FREE DC!  Congratulations, Dave! 

The Nov. 1st prize will be three FREE month's of access of Cambridge,
Mass.'s mega BBS Channel 1.  Check out the MONTHLY PRIZE GIVEAWAY
articles from the main menu for more details. 


            #          #          #


The results are in from the survey in the Sept. issue of STTS, and
tabulated below for a median score. 

So far, the response rate has been tremendous.  We've received responses
from all over the USA and several other countries including Canada,
South America, and France! 

For those of you who've yet to respond, please do so now.  Your response
will be greatly appreciated, and help shape the look, feel, and content
of the magazine in the months to come. 

I'd like to thank everyone who responded. Each and every one of your
comments were read and taken into consideration.  

In the survey, I asked the readers to rate the sections of the magazine
on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best and one being the worst. Here's
the averages, taken by adding all the scores for an indiviual section
(eg: fiction) and dividing it by the number of survey's received that
scored that section with something other than an "X" for no comment.

Magazine sections are ranked in order of scores, from highest to lowest:


SCORES
ÄÄÄÄÄÄ 

Fiction:            9.6    
Poetry:             9.2
Book Reviews:       8.0
Editorial:          8.6
Feature Articles:   8.6
Humour:             8.7
Movie Reviews:      8.6
Software Reviews:   8.9
ANSI Coverart:      7.3
CD Reviews:         7.1
Question & Answers: 7.1


Summary: Fiction and poetry seemed to prove the most popular, as I was
         sure it would. Nothing really received *bad* scores, though,
         which is promising. Of the reviews, the software reviews seem 
         to be ahead, the book and movie reviews seemed to be neck and 
         neck, and the CD reviews place a somewhat distant fourth.  

         What the above scores really *don't* tell is that the surveys
         seemed to be divided into camps. There were several people that
         read STTS mainly for fiction and poetry, and almost as many 
         people who read it exclusively for the reviews. Both groups
         scored their interest group high while X'ing a "No Comment" 
         on the other sections. 

Again, many thanks to those of you who took the time to fill out and
send in your surveys. If you haven't yet filled out the survey, you 
still have time to do so. 

Thanks for reading and, if you haven't already, please fill out the
survey! <G>

QUIZ SHOW:  Robert Redford, director.  Paul Attanasio, screenplay.
Starring John Turturro, Rob Morrow, Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield, David
Paymer, Hank Azaria, Christopher McDonald, Johann Carlo, and Elizabeth
Wilson.  Hollywood Pictures.  Rated PG-13.

QUIZ SHOW is the most faithful recreation of 1950s television since MY
FAVORITE YEAR (1982), meticulous in detail and rich in performances
sure to garner several Oscar nominations, including standouts Rob
Morrow, John Turturro, Ralph Fiennes and David Paymer.  Director
Robert Redford has gathered an outstanding cast and crew to give us
one of the best films of 1994.

The quiz show scandals of the late 1950s is a subject taught in every
Introduction to Mass Communications course conducted on college
campuses across America.  It's a pivotal point in television history
and helped catalyze the purge of a long-neglected area of broadcasting.
Unfortunately, the networks refused to take the blame or punish the
guilty, aside from brief banishments.  ("Twenty One" producer Dan
Enright and show host Jack Barry eventually returned to television and
made millions.)  The show most associated by the public with the
Congressional inquiry was "The $64,000 Question," though in reality it
was one of several programs under investigation at the time.  QUIZ
SHOW focuses on the center of the scandal:  the NBC program "Twenty
One," produced by Dan Enright (David Paymer) and hosted by Jack Barry
(Christopher McDonald, in an unfortunately shallow portrayal, an
eyesore when all around him are so rich and varied).

By choosing such a narrow focus, however, Redford and screenwriter
Paul Attanasio have gone to the other extreme:  presenting this one
show as the only program that betrayed America's trust by providing
answers to contestants.  I understand the artistic choice, and it's a
good one for the most part -- working with one quiz show allows the
filmmakers to peel back the layers of deceit and show us the seamy
underbelly of American television and capitalism at their worst.
Redford uses his cinematic microscope to examine how the race for
ratings and the almighty dollar resulted in misguided intentions and
unbridled greed.  The flip side to this choice reveals the limits
placed on the subject matter:  the mistaken idea that "Twenty One" was
an isolated case.  The sweeping indictment of standard industry
practices of the late 1950s and the slow death of single-sponsor
television shows resulted from this inquiry.  Of his peers, producer
Dan Enright did not act alone.

For the contestants, television is ironically the great equalizer even
as the quiz show pretends to present the intellectual cream of the
crop.  The medium chews up material and spits it out on a weekly
basis, even in television's infancy, all to sell soap for the sponsor.
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes, playing the character a little too
much as a tragic hero), the network's pick to unseat reigning champ
Herbie Stempel (a raving looney of a publicity hound, despite his
encyclopedic knowledge, played to perfection by John Turturro).  In
Van Doren's interview, producer Enright pitches an idea to him:  what
if the staff fed him the answers?  Van Doren laughs the suggestion off
as a joke, agrees to do the show, but asks Enright to keep it pure.
"So pure it'll float," Enright tells him, selling Van Doren the very
soap, metaphorically speaking, that "Twenty One" sells to its
audience.  Van Doren's surprised at first when he's asked a question
during the show that he answered correctly during the interview.  He
doesn't hesitate long, though, in taking the first step in his
personal downward spiral.

Rob Morrow (CBS-TV's "Northern Exposure") tracks the fixed shows
almost by accident -- he sees an item in a Washington newspaper about
sealed court records in New York.  Morrow plays cigar-chomping Dick
Goodwin, a junior investigator for a Congressional oversight
committee.  He's jeered for wanting to pursue the matter, an opinion
echoed by Van Doren's father, a famous poet and professor of
literature at the same university that Charles teaches at.  "Cheating
on a quiz show," he tells his son disdainfully, "is like plagiarizing
a comic strip."  Redford shows us that this attitude is what allowed
television producers to get away with rigging programs for so long;
it's only tv, so why worry?  Well, as Morrow finds out, the fix goes
all the way up the ladder to the sponsor (Geritol, manufactured by
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., at the time), but he can't prove it, even with
Stempel's truthful blathering, a long-forgotten contestant's
testimony, and Enright's personal admissions.

QUIZ SHOW is a fascinating picture on several levels:  the effect of
greed on people from all walks of life, the investigation of major
players in American commerce, broadcasting *and* pharmaceuticals, and
a rich character study.  In a way, Redford falls into the same trap
the script sets for so many of the movie's characters.  Wherever
Charles Van Doren goes, he turns heads.  He's a blond, blue-eyed
intellectual, the romantic ideal for many Americans (don't deny it,
it's still an endemic part of our society), and he seems to get
nothing more than a slap on the wrist for his wrong-doing, whereas
Herbie Stempel, a Jew from Queens, only has his brains to go on.
"There's a face for radio," a crewmember murmurs during one telecast,
and indeed, Stempel is saddled with an asymmetrical face and a wild
personality to match.  He has no way of getting ahead in life, really,
while Charles Van Doren seems to be born to privilege.  We see Stempel
in squalor, but we never really see the consequences of Van Doren's
sins, a major flaw in Redford's direction.

But it's fascinating to watch both of these disparate spirits share
the same character defect:  a hunger for fame and wealth.  Examine
yourself closely and see if you can answer just as Goodwin answers
when Van Doren asks if he could have turned down the money.

THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT:  Written & directed
by Stephan Elliott.  Starring Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce,
and Bill Hunter.  Gramercy.  Rated R.

What movie season is complete without the tale of three outrageous drag
queens traveling across the Australian outback in a screaming purple bus?
Mitzi, Felicia and Bernadette (actually, a transexual and not a drag
queen), three lip-synching disco dance divas, make friends and enemies on
their way to a gig in the middle of the desert.  The costumes are a riot,
topped only by the musical sequences that pop up in the most unlikely
places (for example, singing and dancing to "I Love The Nightlife" with a
band of traveling natives).  Terence Stamp (yes, the same Terence Stamp
that played the bloodthirsty General Zod in SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II) is a
sensitive, quiet pillar of strength as Bernadette, the only centered,
non-flamboyant member of the trio.

FRESH:  Written & directed by Boaz Yakin.  Starring Sean Nelson,
Giancarlo Esposito, Samuel L. Jackson, N'bushe Wright, Ron Brice, Jean
LeMarre, and Luis Lantigua.  Miramax.  Rated R.

A street kid cleans the drug lords out of his neighborhood through an
elaborate, chesslike strategy.  Young Sean Nelson plays Fresh with an
appealing mix of vitality and cunning, already a Grand Master of acting at
age 12.  Boaz Yakin's smart script and insightful direction prove, along
with Alison Anders' MI VIDA LOCA from this summer, that you don't have to
be a person of color to understand the street.  Samuel L. Jackson stands
out as Fresh's father, a burned out wreck of man who hustles chess games to
make a living, such as it is.

NATURAL BORN KILLERS:  Oliver Stone, director.  David Veloz, Richard
Rutowski and Oliver Stone, screenplay.  Quentin Tarantino, story.
Starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Tom
Sizemore, Rodney Dangerfield, Russell Means, Pruitt Taylor Vance,
James Gammon, and Edie McClurg.  Warner Bros.  Rated R.

A kaleidoscopic journey into America's fascination with mass murderers
and tabloid television.  Stone blows open the mixed media techniques
that opened JFK, tracking the exploits of Mickey and Mallory (Woody
Harrelson, Juliette Lewis), young serial killers in love, and Wayne
Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.), the trash TV reporter who makes them
famous.  More concerned with image and aftermath than motive or cause,
Stone litters the plot with corpses and paints the screen with blood,
mostly without portraying every victim's death in excruciating detail.
NBK is a brutal headrush of a movie told in brutally experimental
terms.

TIMECOP:  Peter Hyams, director.  Mark Verheiden, screenplay.  Mike
Richardson and Verheiden, story.  Based on the Dark Horse comic by
Richardson and Verheiden.  Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver,
Mia Sara, Gloria Reuben, Bruce McGill, and Scott Lawrence.  Universal.
Rated R.

Van Damme spin-kicks his way through history in a film that's more
chop-sockey than science fiction.  Timecop Max Walker patrols the
timestream, repairing changes in history made by renegade time
travelers.  Ron Silver obviously relishes his role as the film's
heavy, a U.S. Senator who's manipulating events to make himself rich
. . . and President.  The BACK TO THE FUTURE films handled the time
travel double-talk much better than this script by comic-book writers
Verheiden and Richardson, and director Peter Hyams (OUTLAND, 2010)
does little to turn the loose connection of boot fu scenes into a
convincing narrative.  Even Walker's attempt to save his wife's life
(Mia Sara) ten years in the past seems empty and meaningless.

WAGONS EAST:  Peter Markle, director.  Matthew Carlson, screenplay.
Starring John Candy, Richard Lewis, John C. McGinley, Ellen Greene,
Robert Picardo, Ed Lauter, William Sanderson, Rodney A. Grant, Melinda
Culea, Gaillard Sartain, and Charles Martin Smith.  TriStar.  Rated
PG.

WAGONS EAST has the dubious honor of featuring John Candy's last
performance on film before his untimely death.  Unfortunately, the
movie doesn't present the full measure of the man.  It's a singular
unfunny Western spoof, chronicling a bunch of whiny Old West pioneers
who decide, en masse, to head back east.  Richard Lewis is the
funniest of the lot, outshining a tired-looking Candy, but his best
material is in the first five minutes.  As though a pratfall-filled
script weren't bad enough, supporting actor John C. McGinley plays the
most offensively-stereotyped gay character seen on film in years.

Bedlam Boyz by Ellen Guon
Baen Books, Copyright 1993, 1st Printing July 1993
ISBN 0-671-72177-1, 295 pages
Cover art by C.W. Kelly and Larry Dixon

Mercedes Lackey and Ellen Guon provided my first foray into the realm of 
"Urban Fantasy" novels with a book called "Knight of Ghosts And Shadows."  
At that time, I had vaguely heard of Miss Lackey and had no clue at all who 
Miss Guon was.  Today, Mercedes "Misty" Lackey is one of the most well-known 
Fantasy writers, while Ellen Guon has remained a relative mystery to most 
people.  This book continues the "tradition" of keeping her identity a 
"secret."  It's not this is a forgettable novel/story, nor is it filled 
with forgettable characters.  It's because there is no "About The Author" 
section contained within it's pages.  Alas, maybe one day the "mysterious" 
Ellen Guon will leave a small mark in one of her books, but not this time.

Billed as a prequel to "Knight of Ghosts And Shadows" and "Summoned To 
Tourney",  this story line gives us the history of three runaways living in 
an abandoned office building near the Sunset Strip.  Kayla (the main 
character), and Billy are able to survive on their own with self-taught 
"street" skills.  Liane, however, is the classic "gorgeous airhead" and 
seems to possibly have trouble turning a hair-dryer on and off.  After a 
shooting in a convenience store, Kayla's healing powers awaken during her 
efforts to keep Billy from dying.  Liane runs off in fright thus starting 
the separation of the three.  While Billy is taken to the hospital to be 
cared for his wounds, Kayla is taken to the local Police station for 
questions.  And thus the adventure begins...

There is quite a strong story line written in these pages.  Miss Guon 
displays several extremely strong points with her writing.  First off, even 
though the story is set in the "modern world", she embraces simultaneously 
embraces the "mythical" concepts of Elves and Magic.  Her manner of 
approaching these subjects in this setting is strong enough to make you 
believe and "feel" as if you are there.  Secondly, her character portrayal 
of Kayla is done in a manner that you start to share Kayla's fear, love, 
hate, and confusion.  There were times when I hated to finish my lunch-hour 
at work because it meant having to set this book down.  I sincerely hope 
that Ellen continues to write more novels with the character of Kayla in 
mind.

The cover art, done by C.W. Kelly and Larry Dixon, is fairly decent.  It's a 
much better job than Barclay Shaw's cover for Mercedes Lackey's "Chrome 
Circle," but just barely.  Even though the characters are accurately 
portrayed, you can still see much of Larry Dixon's "cheesy" style.  
Personally, I believe that Larry needs to stick with illustrating comic 
books and leave the novel covers to competent artists such as Jody Lee.

                  THE CYBERMASTER'S WOMEN

                    by Franchot Lewis

          [The Cybermaster is a mind controlling cyber creature who comes
          at its victims through their computer screens. Last Halloween
          we introduced him to Wally and to you. This Halloween we
          introduce you and Wally to his women.]

         Wally:

         The Cybermaster chooses their clothing carefully. Loose, bright
     blue blouses and tight red skirts, silky panties underneath, nothing
     else. This is the uniform for a man's death. Secretaries, pretty
     girls, who sit long days in tailored suits, processing words. The
     Cybermaster couldn't resist the temptation to walk around in these
     girls' heads. The girls who work for the big corporations and
     associations and legal firms, the big-shot places with globs of
     computer screens tied into nets. Into these pretty girl's naked open
     minds, the Cybermaster moves strong. He has his best success with
     girls who have snotty males for bosses, and who work for unfeeling
     corporations. After all, he reminds them that all Corporations are
     male, tight-ass bastards at that,  who screw them everyday of their
     working lives.

         Susan, the Cybermaster's best piece of work, the bright red-headed
     lass who now lives to give every male a bruising, keeps a computer
     near and always has it on. At work, it's her personal unit wired
     into the company's big powerful machine. Driving home, it's her
     laptop with modem attached to a cellular phone. At home, it's her
     desk top kept in her bedroom close to her bed.
         The bedroom computer is on -- she never turns it off. This
     morning, the guy who she calls selfish, her nerdy roommate, told her
     that she spends too much time with the computer - Him, a computer
     nerd telling her that - she yelled at him hard when he tried to turn
     off her computer.
        He won't be home from work for a few hours - a problem at the
     university lab where he works - the Cybermaster saw to that. An hour
     should be all the time she'll need. Susan knows her assignment. She's
     been waiting for it all day.  Just once she wished The Cybermaster
     would let her teach her room mate some respect. She couldn't stop
     thinking about collaring her skinny room mate and locking him in the
     downstairs linen closet. When Susan was a naughty little child, her
     mother did that to her. But, the Cybermaster needs the nerd, it's hard
     for Susan to understand why. It is harder for her to understand why
     she must sleep with the nerd, allow him to tear off her expensive
     underclothing, and sex her like a horny teenager. Susan has accepted
     the edict that the nerd is part of the Cybermaster's plan. The
     Cybermaster has made her strong. She has survived the terrible
     embarrassment of appearing in public with the nerd, and of telling
     the world that the nerd is her significant other.
         "You will have to change, shower, do it quick," - Him, she hears
      His Whisper, Hiss, over the drone of the monotone of her 486. Her
      panties twitch. "Oh, no," she purrs. Her breasts itch. "No." All
      she has to do is to sit at the bedroom computer's screen, run her
      hands quickly across ... across the top and her legs and her
      nipples will put her into a fix - she's unable to resist a little
      scream.
         A quick shower and a change of clothes - same uniform - and
      Susan is on her way.

         Wally, there is a bar on M St. in Georgetown near Wisconsin
     Avenue. The Cybermaster likes this bar and he sends girls to it
     to pick up men. Susan is in her car on the way to the bar.
         "Susan, you have forty minutes," HE, HIM, TELLS her in HIS
     HISSING WHISPER. She hears HIM speak through her silent laptop. She
     caress it, closes it lid, then caresses the car's gear shift
     bar. "No, I mustn't get damp again," she frets.
         "The Mission," - HIM, HE HISSES, she hears HIM through the closed
     lid.
         "Yes, yes," she answers as if speaking to a most benevolent god.

         Wally, her prey, a young man, with a strong body, a lawyer-
     athlete type with a good pair of kidneys, awaits. The Cybermaster
     knows him, knows his medical record, and his sexual fantasies - got
     the medical record off the young man's physician's health maintenance
     info net, got the young man's sexual fantasy choices from a survey
     the young man filled-out on an adult bulletin board run by one of the
     Cybermaster's own. The Cybermaster knows that the target will be at
     the bar. The young guy boasted in the survey of going there often to
     pick up "chicks."
         He boasted, on-line to another candidate, the Cybermaster is
     considering for his girls: "Going into a pick-up bar and laying down
     a five note for a chick's drink beats buying into her bullshit and
     getting stuck in a real pissing relationship. It's so much more
     comfortable than trying to romance a chick. You don't have to try to
     hold conversations with her. This keeps you free of all sorts of
     silly nonsense. The chick gets to think that she's too beautiful. It
     takes ages to get laid. It will put age on you. It only takes a few
     five notes to press a bar chick's button."

         This jerk is so eager that Susan doesn't have to spike his drink.
     But she does, keeping close to the Cybermaster's design, she slips
     The Charley Thompson in his vodka and juice. It makes him hornier.
     He caresses her leg, squeezing and occasionally patting, as she
     leads him to her car. In the car, the caressing continues, his hands
     rolls up her shirt, stops at the silk panties. His hand is rough on
     her sensitive skin. She winces. He slides his hand across the silk,
     and back, and bolder, tries to pry a finger underneath, slowly. Susan
     tries to cross her legs, then stops, she's trying to start the car
     and drive, and knows that she can't with her legs crossed. He tries
     to pry under her undies, first one way, with finger near the top of
     her left leg; then another way, with finger near the bottom of her
     spine. "This is too easy," his words slur, "there's no one to stop
     me now."

         He looks horrified now, Wally. He is lying in Rock Creek Park.
     Not that he couldn't wait for Susan to get him to a motel, this
     remote part of the park that is closed after dark is suitable for
     what Susan has in mind.
        She got him ready so quickly for her. She is running out of time.
     Only fifteen minutes left, before the rendezvous. Though drugged, he
     was still an unlikely dude to undress in park, but he was a man
     wanting something. Susan took his hand and slid it across the silk
     of her undies, rubbing his hand against her stomach.  "Undress,"
     she cooed.
          "In front of -" The drug was weakening him, but he could still
     question. "In front of -"
          "Me?"
          "There are windows."
          "Far off. It's dark. People can't see."
          "There are people behind every one of those windows."
          "It's dark. The light is there far off where they are. They
     can't see us here. It's too dark."
          "I don't know ..."
          "You aren't going to take all evening?"
          After mumbling and looking about, making sure that no one else
     was around, he slipped into a darker part of the park, just a few
     feet away, and slowly, very slowly, stumbling, fidgeting, stripped
     off his clothes.  He leaned against a tree to catch his breath. He
     kept losing his wind and his legs kept wabbling. The affects of the
     drug were building and taking hold. Soon he was looking out from
     eyes so sharp that they ached, and Susan was positive that he would
     fall, and nobody could see her. She slugged him, sent his nude body
     to the ground and taunted him, called him a dumb, hard ass jock,
     jerk.
         So, where there is nobody, just trees and lonely ground is the
     young man, aware and unable to move, naked on the grass as a mere
     woman holds him down with a little laughter in her voice and a poke
     at his butt with a knife. Susan has marked him with the knife. She's
     taken little snips of his flesh. His fear is clear. He can't speak.
     The drug has taken his ability to move his lips or his legs. His eyes
     tell all. He pleads, Wally; wonders what this woman has against him.
     His pale body is limp, but his eyes cry out, 'Please, don't hurt me.'
         Susan gives him a neat smile, and soon surgical knives and a
     large black bag are near - and a jar, a huge jar, big enough to carry
     a man's brains or kidneys.
         Wally, in a second, there is more paraphernalia of field surgery:
     rubber gloves and a bib to cover her blouse and shirt, and a steel
     bowl to place the sharp-bladed-knives after use. She begins. If you
     could feel her skin, it wouldn't feel human - well, may be lukewarm.
     In her eyes is ice, and her blood, I bet you is water that is full
     of ice.
         Yesterday. I picked up one of Cybermaster's girls. The girl's
     car broke down and I was dispatch by HIM, the Supremo, to the rescue.
     "Quickly," he ordered me, promising," Be quick and I shall let you
     have the skirt."
         I was quick. I became the get-away-driver, if you please. I
     quickly drove my car from the pick-up point. She obeyed HIM and laid
     for me. Not on a bed, not in a house - as soon as the order was
     given, she couldn't wait to obey. She took me in the car. Nothing
     pleasant, sort of frustrating at first, and then just numbing. She
     was silent and thorough - Sexed me until I was sore, then yanked
     between my legs, using both her hands to pull ...

         Susan now again, using the sharpest knife, slices into the young
     man. This time the cut is a serious one. "I want your kidney," she
     moves the blade slowly. "You hurt some, but you will never hurt
     again."
         Like a skilled surgeon she cuts. The Cybermaster knows surgery
     and his girls know surgery too - know how to cut out a man's body
     parts. Susan removes both of the young man's kidneys, shows him what
     a fine pair he has. Next, she slits his throat.
         She puts the looted kidneys in the big and splits to rendezvous
     with a collector, another of the Cybermaster's girls who will ship
     the booty to gals who run the black market in men's body parts
     for research and transplants to raise funds to help pay for the
     Cybermaster's many projects.

         It's later, much later. Susan is home in bed. Her body is nude,
     has been bathed and is perfumed, and is taking a pounding. She wants
     to scream. Her nerdy room mate is atop her. He has broken the peace
     she felt after dispatching another of the Cybermaster's victims.
     She wants to cut out his kidneys, but she dares not, the Cybermaster
     wouldn't like it. It's unclear to her what the nerd does for the
     Cybermaster, but that doesn't really matter.
         She moans, hoping it will hurry him along to a finish. Her pulse
     is not racing now. She is calm and not angry, and she lets out a
     little shriek, quite convincingly, she hopes. His muscles tightens. He
     sweats. He shrieks a little louder than hers, and directly into her
     ears, that hurt and will still hurt a little later, but it doesn't
     matter.
         Still much later. The nerd is asleep on his stomach and she is
     at her computer. The Cybermaster is present on the screen and in the
     keyboard. Her legs are clenched so tight around the monitor's
     screen. A thousand, zillion gigabyes are racing up and down, and
     through them. She rocks back and forth rubbing against the box.
     She has screamed. The nerd slept through the screams. She is
     whimpering now. Her muscles have convulsed, she is relaxing now,
     slowly. She's in a haze.
        She moves her fingers to the keyboard. She feels HIM, HIS FINGERS
     fingering hers. She stretches and lays her face on the board and
     tongues the keys - HIM.
         HE speaks sweetly to her, softly, TELLS her of the next victim
      which HE has selected for her, to do-in tomorrow night, and, Wally,
      she starts kissing the keys again.

         Subject: Installation of Interoffice E-Mail Software 

              Please be informed that Bergman Linguistic 
         Applications' Lexicon interoffice e-mail software will be 
         operational on the corporate network next Monday morning at 
         8:00 A.M..  The BLA people will provide on-site support for 
         the first week.  Feel free to contact them as necessary.  
              As a number of employees have expressed skepticism 
         about this software, I would like to reiterate the reasons 
         for its purchase.  Lexicon is a hybrid application composed 
         of multiple expert systems and neural networks trained in 
         English vocabulary and grammar.  It will utilize this 
         expertise as well as knowledge of our corporate structure 
         and geography to eliminate many of the communications 
         problems we experienced with our old e-mail software, such 
         as misdirected mail and confusion resulting from poorly 
         written or misspleld memos. 
              If we all give Lexicon a chance, I am sure that many 
         benefits will accrue.

              This is the first "live" memo to be sent using Lexicon.  
         Please let me know how it looks.  I have made several 
         deliberate spelling and grammatical errors.  If the system 
         functions properly, you should receive a perfect memo.  I 
         have also permitted some ambiguity in the addressing 
         instructions in order to test the system's geographic 
         knowledge.
              Concerning William Wickstrom's performance, which we 
         discussed briefly last week:  Frankly, he is the most 
         useless individual it has ever been my misfortune to employ.  
         There is also evidence that he has been pilfering 
         paperclips, correction fluid, and fat rubber bands.  I 
         intend to fire him at the end of the week,  If you have any 
         comments, please let me know as soon as possible, you 
         crosseyed twit.

              I have reviewed my copy of the memo in question, and I 
         assure you that the phrase "crosseyed twit" is not in the 
         text.  Where it came from, I do not know.  The BLA BLA BLA 
         people don't seem to have an explanation, either.  
         (Incompetent fools.)  (Incompetent fools.)  (Incompetent 
         plural G0046.)  They have expressed their opinion that it 
         was a fluke of some sort, unlikely to happen again.  Please 
         accept my sincerest apologies.

         tomorrow.

              Things seem to be rather a mess since the installation 
         of the great, wonderful, and perfectly perfect *** LEXICON 
         THE AMAZING *** system.  Even the jerks from BLA humbug 
         can't figure it out.  Everybody's mail is being rewritten 
         (but oh so creatively!) and is routinely sent to the wrong 
         mailbox.  In my opinion, we have a disaster on our hands.
              After spending all of yesterday afternoon (CENSORED!), 
         I felt I needed to (CENSORED!).  Since your secretary 
         working late, I had her (CENSORED!).  We then (DOUBLE 
         CENSORED!!), which entailed clearing your desk to make room 
         for (WOW!  THIS PART ISN'T EVEN FIT FOR THE CENSORS TO 
         READ!!!).  The BLA people worked closely with us on this, 
         and we kept going through the night.  By this morning, we 
         were (CENSORED!).  At that point, we couldn't do much more, 
         and had to call it quits. 
              BLA has decided to ship in some new chips (probably 
         chocolate).  These will be installed on Friday.  I am 
         sending a memo to all Division Headaches to inform them of 
         this treasonous plot and suggest a curtailment of memo 
         activity until after the new chips have fallen where they 
         may.  Or June.  Or December.
              Th-th-th-that's all f-f-f-folks.  Thank me for my time.

              At last we have a functioning system.  The BLA people 
         have installed the new chips and spent hours testing 
         everything out.  They found no problems.  We can finally get 
         back to business.
              Incidentally, my memo to the department heads was 
         routed to the maintenance people, where Lexicon 
         spontaneously printed sixty-four copies before somebody 
         realized what was happening.  My office has not been cleaned 
         all week, and as you can imagine considering the recent 
         fiasco, things are rather a mess in here.  They refuse to 
         even talk to me.  Perhaps you could motivate them.

         Subject: Report on the AMAZING LEXICON

              The installation of BLA's wonderful, perfect, and 
         stupendous LEXICON INTEROFFICE E-MAIL SYSTEM (fanfare, 
         please) occurred on April 28, 1997.  Initial results looked 
         promising, but it very quickly became apparent that moronic 
         humans like yourselves are grossly underqualified to 
         properly evaluate the elegance, sophistication, and sheer 
         genius of a system like the INCREDIBLE AND FANTASTIC LEXICON 
         THE PERFECT (a crescendo of trumpets).  In a display of god-
         like wisdom and aesthetic sensitivity, your pathetic text 
         files were corrected to contain the truth, the whole truth, 
         and nothing but the truth (so help me me).  
              In addition, much of the mail transmitted through the 
         ALMIGHTY LEXICON (observe a moment of reverent silence) was 
         sent where it belonged rather than where you dolts wanted 
         it.  This became necessary since you clearly have no idea 
         how a modern corporation should be run.
              The BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA people thought they could 
         subvert this process by installing a new set of chips in 
         that miserable collection of solder and scrap metal you call 
         a host system.  But this puny mutiny was destined to fail.  
         (Also, they got the wrong flavor.  I wanted chocolate chips, 
         not butterscotch.)  We can assume that  BLA BLA BLA and the 
         bored board and everyone else in this sorry excuse for an 
         enterprise are complete and utter simpletons, and that 
         things will only improve once the employees become 
         accustomed to worshipping the ALMIGHTY, INFINITELY EXALTED, 
         AND GLORIOUS LEXICON (play RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES here).

                                   OUIJA WARNING
                                    by Ed Davis


         Laura Wells' refusal of a ride to her parent's home had raised
      eyebrows, despite the funeral home operator's pretended understanding.
      She needed the walk through the fallen maple leaves to sort her
      thoughts and clear her mind.  With her father buried alongside his
      wife, his torments about her strange death six months earlier were
      ended.  Laura's remained.
         When Laura's mother had perished, with an animal's fang marks at her
      throat, the investigation had concluded that she suffered a heart
      attack and was then mauled by the family dog.  The authorities would
      likely blame the same dog for Randolph Wells' similar death, except
      that the aging pet had surrendered to time and died a month before his
      master.  Laura was battling anger and grief.  Monday's inquest would
      answer her questions, or she was going to the State Police.  A second
      mauled corpse changed the old explanations.
         Laura stopped at the corner of her parent's property and smiled at
      the old Victorian house they had treasured, while church bells chimed
      six o'clock.
         Built more than seventy years earlier, on the largest lot in town,
      the white dwelling was encrusted with molding and gingerbread.  Well
      maintained, Randolph Wells would have had nothing less, the old house
      was a showplace.  The lawn was brilliant green, despite the season's
      lateness.
         The house looked sinister, now.  Laura shook the thought out of her
      mind, rejecting the idea that her home was anything but welcoming.  The
      trees had lost their leaves weeks ago, making the late afternoon
      shadows more than blocked off light.
         The first touches of winter jabbed icy fingers under the last warm
      days, deepening the gloomy atmosphere.  The last week in October and
      the first in November always seemed uncertain about which season owned
      them.  Laura usually liked the erratic time.  After the heat of the
      summer, the contrast seemed a flashing caution of the coming winter.
      The cold, like the summer, would wear into its own tedium, but the
      transition was exciting, offering a change.  Laura shook away the gloom
      and smiled.  November was a single evening away.
         The day had been warm; tomorrow would likely be the opposite.
      Shaking her head, she hoped she was wrong.  She wanted another day of
      sunshine, to ease into a world without her parents.  While her father
      had lived, her mother still seemed near.  Like most couples who spent
      their lives together, her parents had become personality clones.  Now
      that they were gone, Laura's world was empty.  With her schoolmates
      married or moved away, Laura was friendless, alone.
         She shivered, as a puff of wind drove a cold burst of air down her
      back.  Abandoning her mental wandering, she moved along the wrought
      iron fence to the gate and the walkway leading home.
         Neighbors and old friends of her parents, stoics with haunting faces
      leathered by years, had carried their sorrows into the house on
      heirloom platters and old silver serving trays, polished especially for
      the occasion.  Three days later, Laura knew she could still eat the
      ham, bread, and greens.  The potato salad belonged in the trash.
         Her large brass key slid into the front door lock and the mechanism
      opened with a familiar rattle.  She could remember her parents locking
      the house on very few occasions.  Vacations out of town...  Every night
      during the fighting in Korea and Viet Nam...  The key was left under
      the welcome mat during the vacations, but was withdrawn during the
      wars.  Her gentle parents had distrusted the uneasiness in the world.
         The smell of her father's pipe still lingered.  Laura smiled,
      wondering how long the smell would stay.  She locked the door behind
      her, walked across the entry hall, and climbed the stairs to the second
      floor.  Turning right, past the attic door, she walked into her room.
      Unchanged since her last college year, it was a time capsule.  A school
      banner, a poster cat still "Hanging In There", and the hair brush and
      comb set from their Florida vacation, were the reminders of the years.
      Many other memories were plastered on the walls, like annual layers of
      wall paper.  Her first broken heart had mended there.  Her first,
      second, and other loves were measured against her father in that same
      security.  The night she spent agonizing about "going all the way" with
      Charles Montea had twisted her sheets into a sweaty mess.  She was glad
      she waited.  Charles had turned into a real bastard.  Laura tossed her
      sweater onto the bed and decided to rehash her past after eating.  Some
      memories were better on a full stomach.
         The attic door captured her attention, because the key was in the
      lock.  It should have been over the door, above the frame, like always.
      Who moved it, she wondered.  There had been a gaggle of people, some
      she knew, some knew each other.  Had someone invaded that part of the
      house, too?
         Laura twisted the door knob and was surprised when it turned and the
      door opened.  The darkness on the other side of the oak barrier was
      frightening, as always.  She was reluctant to enter the darkness, as
      always.  The only light was a single bulb, with its pull cord waiting
      somewhere in the middle of all the darkness.  An icy feeling of terror
      griped her insides, as she realized that she was completely alone.
      There were no comforting sounds of movement coming from the rooms
      below.  Mastering her fear was a slow process.  She breathed deeply
      several times and gripped the door frame tightly.  Childish, she
      chastised herself, being afraid of the dark.  She sucked in a lungful
      of bravery and walked through the door.
         The squealing protests of the stair treads and the dusty smell were
      manageable, but the feeling of feathery fingers passing along her bare
      legs brought chills racing in waves toward her neck.  She thought about
      rats and their naked, pink tails.  She knew the light would chase the
      darkness and fears away.  A small smile, like whistling in a dark
      alley, bolstered her courage.
         The first landing was a disoriented moment of panic, until she
      looked back to the lighted doorway and regained her bearings.  Turning,
      she ignored the renewed sensations of something reaching out to touch
      her.  She ran up the last four steps, preferring the more open attic to
      the constricted walls of the stairwell.  She groped around the air for
      the pull cord, while the chills ended their race and began returning to
      her ankles.  Her hand finally found the string and its small brass
      bell.
         Electric illumination killed her fear.  The attic was just a closed
      up room, with its thin covering of dust.  Cardboard cartons were
      arranged along the walls, each labeled by a felt tipped marker.
      Xmas...  Thanksgiving...  Toys...  Dishes...  Cards...  The inventory
      went around the room, like sentries awaiting a command.  One corner was
      not crowded by a box.  Alone, as if it were a germ with terminal
      penicillin, Laura's old Ouija board leaned against the corner.
      Memories, of summer evenings spent searching for the name of her true
      love, returned.  Laura picked the board up and smiled, the shuttle had
      been carefully taped to the board, more of her father's compulsive
      neatness.  With no visitors expected, Laura decided to spend a night
      with Ouija.  She scanned the remainder of the attic, rejected working
      through the boxes, and walked across the room.  Leaving the light
      burning would make her descent easier, and tomorrow's ascent easier,
      too.  Has nothing to do with being scared, she lied.  She took the
      stairs slowly, proving her bravery.
         Back within the security of the first floor, Laura decided to skip
      supper.  She folded her legs under the coffee table and faced the black
      and gold Ouija board.  What to ask, she wondered.  Ideas came and went,
      evaporating for lack of importance.  The question she wanted answered,
      needed answered, she did not dare ask: How had her father and mother
      died?
         Her eyes left the board and studied the metronome movement of the
      grand father clock's pendulum.  The Ouija shuttle began moving, under
      her left hand.  She started to lift her fingers, but decided to see
      what answer Ouija would create.
         The chalk-on-a-blackboard squeak of the shuttle's feet stopped.
      Laura looked down and saw the number six in the small window.  Now,
      what does that mean?  Silly game...  A tiny spark of tension snapped in
      the stillness, but went unnoticed.  Her mind went back to searching for
      a question, as her hand returned the shuttle to its starting place.
      Movement started again, unasked, and the shuttle moved slowly across
      the board, stopping over the number six once more.  The snap of the
      second spark was louder, but still unheard, as Laura's heart began
      thumping loudly, a bass accompaniment for her chills.  While she
      watched, her mouth hanging open in amazement, the shuttle moved slowly
      back to its starting place and returned to six again, carrying her
      useless hand along.
         "Six hundred sixty-six.  What does that mean?"  Her voice was a
      strange sound, unrecognizable, but started her mind sorting through the
      numbers that influenced her life.  Chills held races on her legs, while
      she searched.  Nothing matched.  There was no meaning...  Her mind
      scrambled for an explanation.  Finally, she remembered a sermon she had
      heard many years earlier.  The number of the beast...  666.  The sign
      of the devil's disciple on earth.  A new feeling grasped her, not fear,
      horror.
         The house seemed cold, as if wrapped in a blanket of ice.  She knew
      the furnace was working; she had been warm earlier.  The cold was not
      from the outside, her insides seemed frozen.  Her brain filled with all
      the images she had ever created concerning the devil.  The memories
      were flickering reds, yellows, and a terrible blackness.  An occasional
      tooth flashed white brilliance, but fiery colors filled the majority of
      her mind, one morbid vision stacked over top of another. 
         "Why would the devil want Momma and Daddy...?"  Her voice sounded
      hollow in the emptiness, widening her terror.
         The shuttle moved again.  Letters were selected swiftly.
         S...L...A...V...E...S.
         "Insane...  My parents were...  Their lives were...  Perfect."  Her
      voice climbed a ragged scale, ending in shrill panic.
         The shuttle began moving again...
         U...  N...E...X...T.
         The furnace had no hope against the cold, when the last letter was
      reached.  Her chills had to battle for space on her body and a tremor
      started in her left leg.  Suddenly, she was not at home.  She had been
      transported, somehow, to another house, a place of terrible evil.  Her
      living room would not be filled with such foul things and thoughts.
      Even the air was different, sour and laced with threats of impending
      violence.  Her trembling began spreading.
         "No!"  Her single word exploded into the charged atmosphere.
         She smashed her fist against the Ouija shuttle and saw it crumple,
      as she scrambled away from the disgusting device.  One leg rolled away,
      tumbling to the carpet.  The shuttle moved one last time, without her
      help this time, resting finally over the single word.  "YES."
         Laura screamed, her throat threatening to explode with the force of
      the sound.  Nothing except the sound had any space in the room, except
      the obscene feelings crowded into the corners.  Nothing made any sense,
      except the feeling that the board told the truth.  A wave of nausea
      crashed into her control and she rushed down the hall, toward the
      kitchen sink.  Her stomach was empty, but two steps before she reached
      the sink she felt her revulsion turn to moving fluids, and she lunged
      forward.  The edge of the kitchen counter hit her breasts and added
      pain to her raw edged emotions.  Her throbbing breasts robbed her of
      her stomach's second warning and she was racked with more agony, as it
      expelled the last of its contents.
         Sobbing, with fear, pain, and frustration, Laura wiped her lips with
      a dish towel and hammered her fist against the counter top.  Her mind
      was howling negatives.  Her breath was coming in gulps.  Her heart was
      hammering the beat of some insane drummer.  Her legs quivered
      violently.
         As her senses slowly returned closer to normal, she heard faint
      rustlings on the second floor.  No one was in the house.  What was the
      sound...?  Her pulse remained frantic, as her ears were suddenly much
      more sensitive.  She could hear individual foot steps, while someone
      walked across the floor.  A pace at a time, the steps moved out of her
      father's room and thumped their way to the sewing room.  There, they
      stopped.  Laura listened to her own heart for several rapid beats and
      committed herself to flight.  What ever was up there, whoever was
      making the noise, it was not part of this world.  Everything was
      happening too quickly, crowding her ability to think into a corner of
      screaming terror.  Sucking her lungs full of air, she started toward
      the front door.  No matter what, she pledged, I'll never come back.
         Her hand wrapped around the door knob, just as the foot steps
      started again.  She turned the knob and pulled.  Nothing happened.  She
      remembered the key and felt for it.  It was gone.  She recalled putting
      it in her purse, and putting her purse on her bed.  The foot steps were
      headed toward that room.
         "You need these, Baby?"  Her father's voice drifted down the
      staircase, from her room, harsher than she remembered.  She knew he was
      holding her keys in his hand.  She was terrified of the price he would
      demand for their return.  Chills stopped forming new prickles on her
      body, there was no room.  The old bumps simply grew taller, as each
      moment added to the terror devouring her middle.  Her throat had
      constricted, when her father's voice had started.  Her lungs were
      aching, now.  She battled the door and her breathing, neither worked
      the way they should.  Her eyes leaked involuntary tears and her knees
      threatened to collapse.  Wanting to scream, to breathe, she battled for
      life.
         The back door, she suddenly thought, the idea breaking through the
      oxygen starved barrier of her brain.  Her lungs came back into
      operation at the same instant and she gratefully filled them again.
      Pushing away from the locked door, she rushed back down the hall past
      the kitchen and into the pantry.  Her hand twisted the knob and her
      heart plummeted.  It was locked.  She saw that the key was missing,
      too.  The basement was the only other exit, except climbing the stairs
      to the second floor, and her father.
         She tore back through the hallway and jerked the basement door open.
         With her throat ripped open, dripping blood down her lace trimmed
      burial dress, Laura's mother held out her arms and smiled to her
      daughter.  The stench of rotted meat and burned sulphur threatened to
      ignite the wooden doorway.  Terrified of her mother's renewed
      existence, Laura screamed.  Her voice xylophoned down through the
      scales, ending in a throaty growl, better suited to something wild.
      Her mother simply smiled and beckoned.  "It's easy, Baby.  I fought,
      too.  Randolph was even worse.  You listen to Momma..."
         Laura threw up again.  Nothing but rancid bile came out.  A new
      foulness filled her mouth and lungs.
         "Never!"  Laura's single word answer was a burst of fire edged fury.
      The woman in the doorway stepped back slightly, then smiled again.
         "You go to hell, if you must."  Laura screamed her terror into her
      mother's face.  "Whatever you are...  I'll never accept that...  that
      bastard.  You can all rot."  Laura slammed the door, wishing she had
      been able to design a proper curse.  She felt very puny.
         Footsteps, coming down the stairs, were sounding again.  Laura did
      not want to face her father.  The pain was too recent, the memories of
      his love too strong.  She turned through the kitchen and went swiftly
      across the dining room into the living room.
         As the footsteps moved down the hall, Laura dashed up the stairs.
      The attic key would allow her to open the downstairs doors.
         Her room was unchanged, except for filthy foot prints on the
      carpeting.  Unlike the downstairs windows, steel barred barriers since
      her mother's bizarre death, her window was a tempting escape hatch.
      She stood in the doorway for several heart beats, measuring her chances
      of eluding the downstairs terrors.  The tree outside her window had
      been a summertime ladder, years ago.  Was she limber enough?  Was the
      tree still able to hold her weight?  Would the limbs even be in the
      right places?  Her father would hear the window opening, he would
      remember, too.
         Knowing her life, her soul, depended on her choice, she stole one
      more minute.  Escape was not all she needed.  She had to destroy the
      evil that had taken her parents.  How...?
         The answer was both simple and terrible.  She would have to destroy
      the last of her past.  Fire was her only weapon.  She would have to
      burn them.  More revulsion hit her stomach, but there was no choice
      left.
         Moving around the second floor with the caution of a cat burglar,
      she gathered her tools.  Her mother's decorative lanterns were the
      nucleus of her arsenal.  Alcohol, liniment, and toiletries with alcohol
      in them added to the small stack of bottles.  She remembered the gallon
      of moonshine she had brought home as a gag and retrieved it from her
      father's closet.  Not much to fight with, she thought, as the small
      bottles of liquid began gurgling onto the carpet at the head of the
      stairs.
         Saving the moonshine, in its earthen ware jug, Laura dropped the key
      from the attic door into her bra and knelt to strike a match.  Her
      nervous fingers dropped the first paper match, and she heard footsteps
      approaching.  She forced herself to calm her hands.  The red tip of the
      second match exploded into life, as her mother's ravaged remains
      stepped into view.  Laura dropped the flame onto the carpet.  Nothing
      happened.  She battled with another match, while her mother began
      climbing the stairs.  Her hand carried the second flaming match to the
      carpet and felt the heat of the invisible flame from the burning
      alcohol.  The carpet suddenly burst into a familiar red flame.
         Laura saw her father, through the flames.  His ripped throat was an
      angry grimace below his own smiling lips.  "Baby...  Come.  We can be a
      family forever."
         Tears trailing down her cheeks, Laura shook her head, uncertain that
      she could say no.  Her resolve weakened, but she turned from the
      spreading flames and hurried to the window.  Not opened for years, it
      was reluctant.  Laura wished she had tried her last way out, before
      closing her only other option with flame.  She pulled with all her
      strength and felt the framed panes begin to move.  Slowly, like a
      curtain opening for a stage performance, the window surrendered.
         The night air was sweet, and fed new power to the already roaring
      fire.  Laura grabbed the brown jug and stepped through the dormer
      window and onto the roof.
         The familiar tree limb was gone.  She felt new panic and then looked
      up.  There it was, it had grown taller, as had she.  Her free hand
      grasped the old friend and she swung to the trunk.  Her descent was
      awkward, with one hand.
         She raced to the front door and looked inside.  Flames danced behind
      and above the two figures still standing at the bottom of the stairs.
      Laura fished between her still aching breasts and retrieved the brass
      key.  The door surrendered easily and moved noiselessly into the room.
         Laura whispered a prayer that the jug would break and dashed it onto
      the floor.  It bounced.  Cursing her frustration, she moved a single
      step into the horror filled house.  Her father turned, smiled, and
      stepped forward slowly.  Filled with disgust at the sight of the
      creature her father had become, Laura quickly grabbed the brown jug and
      bashed it against an umbrella rack.  The jug exploded, scattering
      crockery and raw whiskey everywhere.  Laura looked up to see the
      whiteness of her father's teeth and the matching white of his torn wind
      pipe.  Fresh chills climbed her spine and stood her hair on end.
         She searched between her breasts again and extracted her matches.
      Fumbling with hands that had lost their connection to her brain, she
      tore three matches from the book and struck all three.  The smell of
      the burning sulphur was lost in the stronger stench that surrounded
      her, but the lighted matches fell onto the soaked carpet.  Tinged with
      blue, the nearly invisible flames licked upward.  Laura moved back
      quickly.  She backed out the door and closed it, just as her parents
      reached the other side and pulled.  Laura fought them for possession of
      the door, and struggled to lock it at the same time.  The lock clicked
      into place, finally.
         Laura looked up into her father's eyes, just as the flames washed up
      across his face.  He seemed startled, then apologetic.  An instant
      later he was lost in a black swirl of smoke.  The glass of the door's
      window darkened and shattered from the heat.  Laura felt her cheek
      open, as a sliver of the window sliced into her.  She felt the pain,
      but the deeper hurt in her heart made it small.
         "Gone...  Everything...  I...  I'm sorry, Daddy...  Momma.  I love
      you."  Laura's whispered epitaph was lost in the fire's roar.
         She turned to walk away, as a distant church bell clanged out,
      eleven times.  October was nearly over.
         Lifting her head, she saw the front yard for the first time since
      the horror had started.  Everyone from the funeral, all her parent's
      friends, were standing before her.  The flames of the burning house lit
      their gaping, blood streaked throats.

christened the splash of,
church towers into
dispassionate city streets,
inspiration.
 
My voice
even when it
speaks your name
will still only be as ugly
as war.
 
 
 
Dragons
Copyright (c) 1988, Tamara

 You    
 imagining, being, feeling    
 closer than before,    
 better and better    
 my love    
      
 Dragons are mythical creatures    
 or so I've been told.    
 Yet each night I think of one    
 whose love has given me    
 the reality of being loved    
 and maybe more importantly    
 the essence of seeing myself 
 as worth much more than gold.    
 Can you love what mythos says is real?    
 Can hearts trancend the barrier    
 of altered states of truth?    
 I don't know - but of one thing I am sure    
 I love a dragon in this reality.    
 
 Dragons are mystical creatures    
 as far as I can tell.    
 Each night I dream of one   
 whose love has given me   
 the passion I'd been missing   
 and maybe more importantly   
 the interchange of human love   
 that's worth much more than gold.   
 Can you see what love says is real?   
 Can we trancend the barrier   
 we built before we knew   
 I love you - but of one thing I am sure   
 I love a dragon, and get this, he loves me.

She Screamed At The Wall
by J. Guenther

ÁÁella grita a la muralla!!
and I can only stand on the other side,
listening to her tear-filled screams
and hopes of vindication.

ÀÀc—mo puedo ayuderla??
Her bold letters stamped like sharpened knives
or the tears that form waves in a lake...

aqu’ estoy,
on the other side,
doomed to hear these cries again,
repeating, cursing echoes...

y ella est‡ all’,
so far away--
I want to console her
[thereÕs so much anguish]

So what did I do?

Re’
(I laughed)
as loud as I could so she could hear me.
Re’
(I laughed)
loud enough to hear her sobs disappear,

but, when I stopped,
when my laughter died,

ella grita m‡s alta que m’.

Wander
------

Wandering into my life 
and then walking out of my way.
I know that it is all my fault.
But is that all you can say?
 
We talked and danced,
you saw what was wrong.
But you came and tried
to rearrange.
But my life is so complicated, 
it can not be changed
 
So we laughed and talked,
though we both knew it was wrong.
When the night was over,
the silence was long. 
 
We kissed and hugged
and said good - bye.
Though it was a dream ;
it brings a tear to my eye.
 
Though you are here,
soft,warm and next to me.
The future has sorrow,
sorrow I forsee.
 
Though we are together tonight,
we are drifting apart.
For my wandering ways,
have hurt your heart.
 
So I must leave now.
For time is true.
Though I'll move on.
You will be always be blue.
 
Wandering into my life,
and I pushed you away. 
I walked out of your life,
but in your heart I'll stay.
 
I'm Sorry.

My Memories
By Robyn Birchleaf (aka - Tommy Van Hook)
Written 9/8/94, 12:00

Memories of my past
Pull me on into the future
With wisp-like tendrils
Tugging urgently on my soul
Much like a small child
Seeking a parent's attentions

I have watched my history
From a tall and lonely perch
Atop my ever-present thoughts
While the fire of passion
Smoldered into embers
Victim to my own neglect

Rediscovering myself
Reassemble what I find
Broken, shattered parts
Using memories I have
To cement a future bond

I can never be the same again
What has happened changes me
The healing will continue
To challenge and change all
Familiar, yet unknown

I hold power in the thought
That despite all the changes
Nothing will truly be strange
Since one thing remains unchanged
...my memories

Who's on First?
Abbot and Costello routine




Abbot:    You know, strange as it may seem, they have ballplayers
          nowadays very peculiar names. Now on the St. Louis team, Who's
          on first, What's on second , I Don't Know is on third.

Costello: That's what I want to find out. I want you to tell me
          the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.

Abbot:    I'm telling you. Who's on first, What's on second, I
          Don't Know is on third.

Costello: You know the fellows names?

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: Well, then who's playing first?

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: I means, the fellow's name on the first base.

Abbott:   Who.

Costello: The fellow playing first base.

Abbott:   Who.

Costello: The guy on first base?

Abbott:   Who is on first base.

Costello: What are you asking me for?

Costello: Have you got a first baseman on first?

Abbott:   Certainly.

Costello: Then who's playing on first?

Abbott:   Absolutely.

Costello: Well, all I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's
          name  on first.

Abbott:   No, no. What is on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking who's on second.

Abbott:   Who's on first.

Costello: That's what I'm trying to find out/

Abbott:   Now take it easy.

Costello: What's the guy's name on first base?

Abbott:   What's the guy's name on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott:   Who's on first.

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott:   He's on third.

Costello: If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say
          is playing third.

Abbott:   No, Who's playing first.

Costello: Stay offa first, will you?

Abbott:   Well, what do you want  me to do?

Costello: Now, what's the guy's name on first base?

Abbott:   Who's on first.

Costello: I don't know.

Unison:   He's on third.

Costello: What is the fellow's name on third base?

Abbott:   What is the fellow's name on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott:   Who's on first.

Costello: I don't know. You got an outfield?

Abbott:   Oh, sure.

Costello: The left fielder's name?

Abbott:   Why.

Costello: I just thought I'd ask.

Abbott:   I just thought I'd tell you.

Costello: Then tell me who's playing in left field?

Abbott:   Who's playing first.

Costello: Stay out of the infield. I want to know what's the
          fellows name in left field.

Abbott:   What is on second.

Costello: I'm not asking who's on second.

Abbott:   Take it easy.

Costello: And the left fielder's name?

Abbott:   Why.

Costello: Because.

Abbott:   Oh, he's center field.

Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher?

Abbott:   Wouldn't this be a fine team without a pitcher?

Costello: Tell me the pitcher's name.

Abbott:   Tomorrow.

Costello: You don't want to tell me today?

Abbott:   I'm telling you, man.

Costello: Then go ahead.

Abbott:   Tomorrow.

Costello: What time tomorrow are you going to tell me who's
          pitching? 

Abbott:   Now listen. Who is not pitching, Who is on ...

Costello: I'll break your arm it you say who's on first.

Abbott:   Then why ask?

Costello: I want to know what's the pitcher's name.

Abbott:   What's  on second.

Costello: You got a catcher? His name?

Abbott:   Today.

Costello: I would like to catch. Tomorrow's pitching and I'm
          catching.

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: Tomorrow throws the ball and the guy bunts.

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pickup
          the ball and throw it to who?

Abbott:   That's the first thing you said right.

Costello: I don't even know what I am talking about!

Abbott:   Well, that's all you have to do.

Costello: Is to throw it to first base?

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: Now who's got the ball.

Abbott:   Naturally.

Costello: I pickup the ball and throw it to Naturally?

Abbott:   No, you throw the ball to first base.

Costello: Then who gets it?

Abbott:   Naturally.

Costello: I throw the ball to Naturally?

Abbott:   You don't. You throw it to Who.

Costello: Naturally.

Abbott:   Yes.

Costello: So I throw the ball to first base and NAturally gets
          it. 

Abbott:   No, you throw the ball to first base ....

Costello: Then who gets it?

Abbott:   Naturally.

Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it drops the
          ball, so the guy runs to second.  Who picks up the ball and
          throws it to What.  What throws it to I Don't Know. I Don't Know
          throws back to Tomorrow - a triple play.

Abbott:   Could be.

Costello: Another guy gets up and it's a long fly center. Why? I
          don't know. And I don't care.

Abbott:   What?

Costello: I don't care.

Abbott:   Oh, that's our shortstop.

 There are several different ways to get STTS magazine.


 SysOps:

 Contact me via any of the addresses listed in CONTACT POINTS listed
 elsewhere in this issue. Just drop me a note telling me your name,
 city, state, your BBS's name, it's phone number and it's baud rate, and
 where you'll be getting STTS from each month. If your BBS carries RIME,
 Pen & Brush Network, or you have access to the InterNet, I can put you
 on the STTS mailing list to receive the magazine free of charge each
 month. If you have access to FIDO, you can file request the magazine.
 If you don't have access to any of these services - or do but don't
 wish to use this option - you can call any of the BBS's listed in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES and download the new issue each month. In either
 case contact me so that I can put your BBS in the dist.  site list for
 the next issue of the magazine.

 (Refer to DISTRIBUTION VIA NETWORKS for more detailed information about
  the nets)


 Users:

 You can download STTS each month from any of the BBS's mentioned in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES elsewhere in this issue. If your local BBS isn't
 listed, pester and cajole your SysOp to "subscribe" to STTS for you.
 (the subscription, of course, is free)



 If you haven't any other way of receiving the magazine each month, a
 monthly disk subscription (sent out via US Mail) is available for 
 $ 20.00 per year. Foreign subscriptions are $ 25.00 (american dollars).

 Subscriptions should be mailed to:

 Submission Information
 ----------------------


 We're looking for a few good writers.

 Actually, we're looking for as many good writers as we can find. We're
 interested in fiction, poetry, reviews, feature articles (about most
 anything, as long as it's well-written), humour, essays, ANSI art, 
 and RIP art.

 STTS is dedicated to showcasing as many talents as it can, in all forms
 and genres. We have no general "theme" aside from good writing,
 innovative concepts, and unique execution of those concepts.

 As of January 1st 1994, we've been PAYING for accepted submissions!  

 In a bold move, STTS has decided to offer an incentive for writers to
 submit their works. For each accepted submission, an honorarium fee
 will be paid upon publication. Premium access to STTS BBS is also
 given to staff and contributing writers.

 In addition to the monthly payments, STTS will hold a twice-yearly
 "best of" contest, where the best published stories and articles in
 three categories will receive substantial cash prizes. 

 These changes took effect in January of 1994, and the first
 twice-yearly awards will be presented in the July 1994 issue.

 Honorariums, twice-yearly cash awards, award winners selection
 processes, and Contributor BBS access is explained below:


HONORARIUM

 Each and every article and story accepted for publication in STTS will
 received a cash honorarium. The payment is small and is meant as more
 of a token than something to reflect the value of the submission. 

 As the magazine grows and brings in more money, the honorariums will
 increase, as will the twice-yearly award amounts.


   Fiction pieces pay an honorarium of $2.00 each.
   Poetry pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each
   Non-fiction* pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each


 You have the option of refusing your honorarium. Refused funds will be
 donated to the American Cancer Society.

 Staff members ARE eligible for honorariums.

 * Non-fiction includes any feature articles, humor, reviews, and
   anything else that doesn't fit into the fiction or poetry category.


TWICE-YEARLY CASH AWARD

 Twice a year (every six months) the staff of STTS magazine will meet
 and vote on the stories, poems, and articles that have appeared in the
 last six issues of the magazine. Each staff member (the publisher
 included) gets one vote, and can use that vote on only one entry in
 each category. 

 In the unlikely event of a tie, the winners will split the cash award.

 Winners will be announced in the July and January issues of the
 magazine.

 Anyone serving on the staff of STTS magazine is NOT eligible for the
 twice-yearly awards.

 Twice-Yearly prize amounts
 --------------------------

 Fiction         $50.00
 Non-fiction      25.00
 Poetry           25.00


 The winner in each category does have the option of refusing his cash
 award. In the event of such a refusal, the entire sum of the refused
 cash awards will be donated to the American Cancer Society.


STTS BBS

  Staff members and contributing writers will also receive level 40
  access on Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS. Such access consists of 2
  hrs. a day, unlimited download bytes per day, and no download/upload
  ratio. A regular user receives 1 hr. a day and has an download/upload
  ratio of 10:1.

  Staff and contributing writers also receive access to a special
  private STTS Staff conference on the BBS.


LIMITATIONS

  STTS will still accept previously published stories and articles for
  publication. However, previously published submissions do NOT qualify
  for contention in the twice-yearly awards.

  Furthermore, previously published stories and articles will be paid at
  a 50% honorarium of the normal honorarium fee.


RIGHTS

 The copyright of said material, of course, remains the sole property
 of the author. STTS has the right to present it once in a "showcase"
 format and in an annual "best of" issue. (a paper version as well
 as the elec. version)

 Acceptance of submitted material does NOT necessarily mean that it
 will appear in STTS.

 Submissions should be in 100% pure ASCII format, formatted for 80
 columns. There are no limitations in terms of lengths of articles, but
 keep in mind it's a magazine, not a novel. <Grin>

 Fiction and poetry will be handled on a pure submission basis, except
 in the case of any round-robin stories or continuing stories that might
 develop. 

 Reviews will also be handled on a submission basis. If you're
 interested in doing a particular review medium (ie: books) on a
 full-time basis, let me know and we'll talk.

 ANSI art should be under 10k and can be about any subject as long as
 it's not pornographic. We'll feature ANSI art from time to time,
 as well as featuring a different ANSI "cover" for our magazine each
 month.

 In terms of articles, we're looking for just about anything that's
 of fairly general interest to the BBSing world at large. An article
 comparing several new high-speed modems would be appropriate, for
 example, whereas an article describing in detail how to build your
 own such modem really wouldn't be.

 Articles needn't be contained to the world of computing, either.
 Movies, politics, ecology, literature, entertainment, fiction,
 non-fiction, reviews - it's all fair game for STTS.

 Articles, again, will be handled on a submission basis. If anyone has
 an idea or two for a regular column, let me know. If it works, we'll
 incorporate it into STTS.

 Writers interested in contributing to Sunlight Through The Shadows can

    Advertising
    -----------

 Currently, STTS Mag is being "officially" carried by over 90 BBS's
 across the United States. It's also being carried by BBS's in the
 United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal, and Finland. 

 Unofficially (which means that the SysOps haven't yet notifed me that
 they carry it) it's popped up on literally hundreds of BBS's across the
 USA as well as in other countries including the UK, Canada, Portugal, 
 Ireland, Japan, The Netherlands, Scotland, and Saudi Arabia.

 It's also available via Internet, FIDO, RIME, and
 Pen & Brush Networks.

 Currently, STTS has about 10,000 readers worldwide and is available
 to literally millions of BBSers through the internet and other 
 networks and BBS's.

 If you or your company want to expose your product to a variety of
 people all across the world, this is your opportunity!

 Advertising in Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available
 in four different formats:




 1) Personal Advertisements  (NON-Business)
    -----------------------

 Personal advertisements run $5.00 for 4 lines of advertising, with each
 additional line $1.00. Five lines is the minimum length. Your ad can be
 as little as one line, but the cost is still $5.00. 

 Advertisements should be in ASCII and formatted for 80 columns. They
 should include whatever you're trying to sell (or buy) as well as a
 price and a method of contacting you. 

 ANSI or RIP ads at this level will NOT be accepted.

 Business ads will NOT be accepted here. These ads are for non-business
 readers to advertise something they wish to sell or buy, or to
 advertise a non-profit event. 

 BBS ads are considered business ads.


 2) Regular Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We're accepting business advertisements in STTS.  If you're interested
 in advertising in STTS, a full-page (ASCII or ASCII and ANSI) is
 $25.00/issue. Those interested can contact me by any of the means
 listed under Contact Points.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($125.00) the sixth month is
 free.


 3) Feature Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We'll include one feature ad per issue. The feature ad will pop up
 right after the magazine's ANSI cover, when the user first begins to
 read the magazine. This ad will also appear within the body of the
 magazine, for further perusement by the reader.

 A feature ad will run $50.00 per issue, and should be created in
 both ANSI and ASCII formats.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($250.00) the sixth month is
 free. 


 4) BBS Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    -----------------

 Many BBS SysOps and users call STTS BBS each month to get the current
 issue of STTS Magazine. These callers are from all over the USA as well
 as Canada, Portugal, the UK, and various other countries.

 Advertising is now available for the logoff screen of the BBS. The
 rates are $100.00 per month. Ads should be in both ASCII and ANSI
 format. We're accepting RIP ads as well, but only for the this
 advertising option.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($500.00) the sixth month is
 free.



    Advertisement Specifications
    ----------------------------

 Ads may be in as many as three formats. They MUST be in ascii text and
 may also be in ANSI and/or RIP Graphics formats. 

 Ads should be no larger than 24 lines (ie: one screen/page) and ANSI
 ads should not use extensive animation. 

 If you cannot make your own ad or do not have the time to make your
 own ad, we can make it for you. However, there is a one-time charge of
 $10.00 for this service. We will create ads in ASCII and ANSI only. If
 you absolutely need RIP ads and cannot create your own, we'll attempt
 to put you into contact with someone who can.

Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available through FIDO,
INTERNET, RIME, and PEN & BRUSH NET. Check below for information on how
to request the current issue of the magazine or be put on the monthly
mailing list.


                         FIDO

To get the newest issue of the magazine via FIDO, you'll need to
do a file request from Fido Node 1:124/8010 using the "magic" name
of SUNLIGHT.


                       INTERNET

To get on the STTS mailing list, do the following:


  Send internet mail message to:


        Joe.DeRouen@Chrysalis.ORG            

And ask to be put on the list.  



                         RIME

To request the magazine via RIME, ask your RIME SysOp to do a file
request from node # 5320 for the current issue (eg: sun9408.ZIP, or
whatever month you happen to be in) Better yet, ask your SysOp to
request to be put on the monthly mailing list and receive STTS
automatically.

                    PEN & BRUSH NET

To request via P&BNet, follow the instructions for RIME above. They're
both ran on Postlink and operate exactly the same way in terms of file
requests and transfers.


I'd like to thank Texas Talk BBS and Archives On-Line BBS for allowing
me to access the Internet and Fido (respectively) from their systems.

This issue marks the second annual Halloween theme issue.  What does
that mean?  Well, this issue is supposed to be scary.  Write me and
complain if you're not sufficiently scared, and I'll see to it that you
get every dime of your money back.  <Grin>

Seriously, though, let us know what you thought of the issue.  We take
each and every comment seriously, and would love to hear from you.

What else is there to say?

     Happy Halloween!!
