Welcome to Sunlight Through The Shadows magazine! In this issue, as well
as in the future, STTS will strive to bring you the best in fiction,
poetry, reviews, article, and other assorted reading material.

STTS Magazine has no general "theme" aside from good writing, innovative
concepts, and the unique execution of those concepts.

STTS wouldn't have been possible without the aid, support, and guidance
of three women:

Inez Harrison, publisher of Poetry In Motion newsletter. Her's was the
first electronic magazine I ever laid eyes upon, and also the first such
magazine to publish my work. She's given me advice, and, more
importantly, inspiration.

Lucia Chambers, publisher of Smoke & Mirrors Elec. Magazine and head of
Pen & Brush Network. She gave me advice on running a magazine,
encouragement, and hints as to the kind of people to look for in
writers.

Heather DeRouen, my wife. Listed last here, but always first in my
heart. She's proofread manuscripts, inspired me, listened to me, and,
most importantly, loved me. Never could I find a better woman to live
life by my side, nor a better friend.

Now that that's said and done... Again, welcome to Sunlight Through The
Shadows Magazine! I hope you enjoy it.

Sigh. A number of things contributed to this being a "small" issue, none
of which the least was computer problems. I had some problem with the
STTS support BBS, but managed to fix everything. Unfortunately, the
magazine was delayed and some articles were lost. Everything should be
back to normal next month, though.

The second reason is that February is just too darned short. <grin>

See you next month!

  The Staff
  ---------

  Joe DeRouen............................Publisher and Editor

  L. Shawn Aiken.........................Fiction, articles
  Heather DeRouen........................Book Reviews
  Bruce Diamond..........................Movie Reviews
  Liz Shelton............................Answer Me Columnist
  Gage Steele............................Monster BBS Columnist
  Tamara.................................House Poet


  Joe DeRouen publishes, edits, and writes for STTS magazine. He's had
  poetry and fiction published in several on-line magazines and a few
  paper publications as well. He's written exactly 1.5 novels, none of
  which, alas, have seen the light of publication. He attends college
  part-time in search of that always-elusive english degree. In his
  spare time, he enjoys reading, running his BBS, collecting music,
  playing with his five cats, singing opera, hunting pseudopods, and
  most importantly spending time with his beautiful wife Heather.

  L. Shawn Aiken dropped out of college when he realized that they
  couldn't teach him the two things he wanted to do, live successfully,
  and write.  He had to find out these things all by himself on the
  road.  Thus he became a road scholar.  After spending his life hopping
  country to country, state to state, he now feels confident in his
  abilities and is working on his literary career.  His main endevour is
  to become successful in the speculative fiction area, but he enjoys
  writing all forms of literary art.

  Heather DeRouen writes software for the healthcare industry, CoSysOps
  Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS, enjoys playing with her five cats,
  cross-stitching, and reading. Most of all, she enjoys spending time
  with her dapper, charming, witty, and handsome (not to mention modest)
  husband Joe. Heather's help towards editing and proofreading this
  magazine has been immeasurable.

  Bruce Diamond, part-time pseudopod and ruler of a small island chain
  off the coast of Chil‚, spends his time imitating desk lamps when he
  isn't watching and critiquing movies for LIGHTS OUT, his BBS movie
  review publication (now syndicated to over 15 boards).  Bruce started
  reviewing movies for profit in 1978, as part of a science fiction
  opinion column he authored for THE BUYER'S GUIDE FOR COMICS FANDOM
  (now called THE COMICS BUYER'S GUIDE).  LIGHTS OUT, now a year old, is
  available through Bruce's distributor, Jay Gaines' BBS AMERICA
  (214-994-0093).  Bruce is a freelance writer and video producer in the
  Dallas/Fort Worth area.

  Liz Shelton works in an office all day, but by night she pokes around
  on her computer (to include a large portion of BBSing), and practices
  her guitar (she needs a LOT more practice).  Liz likes to write when
  she gets the notion, as long as she doesn't have to be too serious.

  Gage Steele, illegitimate love child of Elvis Presley and Madonna, has
  been calling BBS's since the early seventies. Having aspired to write
  for an electronic magazine all her life, Gage is now living the
  American dream. Aged somewhere between 21 and 43, she plans to
  eventually get an english degree and teach foreign children not to
  dangle their participles.

  There is very little known about Tamara, and she prefers to let it
  remain that way. She's a woman of mystery and prefers to remain hidden
  in the shadows of the BBS world. (Enigmatic, don't you think?)

  Dave Bates is an Environmental Compliance Administrator for the City
  of Goshen, Indiana.  He has written several short stories, many of
  which deal with ecological topics.  None have been published to date.
  He is also working on a novel dealing with a chemical spill disaster.
  He has had one article, on household hazardous waste, published in a
  national journal.  His hobbies include BBSing, reading, numerous
  outdoor activites and, for the time being, writing.  He has a Master's
  Degree in Public Administration.

  Mark Denslow is a student at Saint Chrles Borromeo Seminary in the
  Religious Studies Division in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is
  working toward his Cerificate in Religious Studies and Roman
  Chatechetical Diploma. He hopes to be admitted to their Master of Arts
  Degree Program after completing the Cerificate and Diploma. He enjoys
  Poetry, Genealogy, Computing, and Religion.

  Grant Guenther, sometimes known as J. Guenther, confesses to be from a
  long-lost Martian colony, but in-depth investigations reveals that he
  was born and raised in a small but well-to-do community called
  Hartland in Wisconsin.  A senior, he has written several collections
  of poems, and won many awards from his high school literary magazine,
  including 1st place for poetry and short-short fiction.  He is the
  editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and writes as a humor
  columnist (or at least he thinks so).

  Albert Johnston survived twenty years of indiscretion + twenty years
  of trying to get my karma straight. Forty years total. He feels like
  he's the same person he was at 18, he just moves a lot slower. He has
  two teenage sons, which should put him in line for some sort of
  citation.  He and his wife have been on a joint voyage of discovery
  for the last 18 years. His main means of providing for his family at
  this time is supervising a rag tag band of fugitive diesel mechanics
  at the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, aka DART, in Texas. He's been doing
  this for about ten years, but still hasn't decided what he wants to be
  when he grows up.

  A trained economist, Kathy Kemper spends much of her time away from
  ordinary business pursuits.  It could correctly be stated that she
  has 'gone to the dogs' as a great deal of her time is spent with
  her Border Collies.  These dogs dominate her life (or at least try
  to).  She is the officer of several organizations and a free-lance
  writer who has actually been published and paid for her works.
  Kathy is new to the world of BBSing but seems to enjoy it greatly.
  She has yet to decide what she wants to be when she grows up.

  Robert McKay was born in Hawthorne, California, one of the few native
  Californians in existence. He calls the area north of Goffs home,
  though he currently lives in Marlow, Oklahoma, and has in fact lived
  in Texas and Oklahoma since 1980. The setting for several of his
  stories comes from the desert west of Needles, where he grew up. He
  has one wife and two daughters, meaning he's seriously outnumbered in
  any argument. He writes mostly science fiction, with some horror
  thrown in - Lovecraftian horror being his favorite, followed by
  non-conventional vampire stories. He's been published in three
  elecmags - Sunlight Through the Shadows, Smoke & Mirrors, and Ruby's
  Pearls - and is currently waiting on the publication of two science
  fiction novels on disk.

  F. Edson Meade enjoys scotch, lends out books, and is a dangerous pool
  player.

  Harlan Pine has lived in many differant places owing to the fact that
  his father was in the Air Force.  He currently resides in North Texas
  by choice.  Besides writing romantic vignettes, he also enjoys
  exploring the relms of Dark Fantasy.  He is currently working on a
  novel and several short stories.  This is his first sale.

  Daniel Sendecki is a young, emerging, Canadian writer who lives
  in Burlington, Ontario.  Currently, Daniel is pursuing his writing
  interests at home but intends to study literature at McGill
  University, in Montreal, Quebec.

  Thomas D. Van Hook, sargeant in the USAF and part time demigod, is
  stationed somewhere in northern Europe.  Due to the many warrants out
  for his arrest and psychotic acquaintances, he has asked that his
  precise location be kept anonymous.  He and his wife Kathy spend much
  of their free time investing in the diaper industry due to a tiny
  Elfling that was laid upon their doorstep....recently dubbed Corey.
  In an effort to escape such bondage, Tommy has taken to haunting
  various castle- ruins, playing tag-you're it with certain ugly porcine
  creatures, reading SF and gracing his friends with poetry.  His poetic
  style is marked with a characteristic honesty and directness that
  ranges from the dark and brooding to startling reflections of life.

  Marty Weiss began his freelance writing activities after retiring from
  a career as a business executive. He's had three non-fiction
  (business) books published as well as some feature and Op-Ed articles
  in magazines, newspapers, and Sunday supplements. He has been writing
  a regular column, "Through Marty's Eyes," for a regional newspaper for
  the last several years. When not writing or BBSing, he spends his time
  reading, doing business consulting, and growing older with Eileen, his
  wife.

  David Ziegler's first poetry was a small collection that he gave away
  to a few friends. He then started  writing Satirical Prose and found
  it a great stress reliever.  He lives in Sacramento with his wife
  Gloria and two cats. They spend a considerable time traveling which
  gives him fodder for the keyboard.  Writing to David is a kind of
  cleansing it is something that when he has to do it he has no choice.
  By the same token, he couldn't write on demand if you put a gun to his
  head.

Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS News

STTS BBS is ran on TriBBS v5.1 software (registered, of course), a 33Mhz
80386 DX computer, two IDE hard drives (120 meg and 170 meg), a Zoom
14.4k Fax/Modem, and a VGA monitor. Soon, it'll be hooked up via a LAN
to a 50Mhz 80486 DX with half a gig of storage space.

It's run on one phone line, and the number is (214) 620-8793. At some
point in the near future, we hope to add another node as well as a 28.8k
Fax/Modem. 

One last thing - it's entirely free. Donations are accepted (so far,
I've only received three) but you can't buy higher access. Access is
completely, 100% FREE. 

STTS BBS carries 30+ doors (games and information), a good deal of them
registered. We also carry four networks (RIME, Pen & Brush Net, World
Message Exchange, and PlanoNet) as well as a large file area. The file
area specializes in electronic magazines (carrying the entire back issue
run of several!), texts on all subjects, and shareware text adventure
games. Of course, there's also a wide variety of other programs to be
had, including BBS doors, telecommunication packages, arcade/adventure
games, offline mail readers, and more! Additionally, STTS BBS is a
support BBS for TriBBS software and carries just about all the programs
available out there for TriBBS. STTS BBS is also a regional HUB for Pen
& Brush Net (P&BNet) as well as a HUB for World Message Exchange (WME).
Lastly, we're a member of the American BBS Association. 

About 70% of the callers are from Texas, as it's a Dallas-based BBS. The
other 30%, however, are from just about everywhere else. Oklahoma,
California, Virginia, Oregon, Kansas, Illinois - you name it. We've had
several people from Canada and the UK call as well. Most of the long
distance callers are SysOps calling to download STTS Magazine every
month (those that don't get it through the net) but there's several
"just plain users" who call to participate in the message base or
download files. 


Each month, we'll discuss additions and upgrades to the BBS as well as
new door games added, nets or conferences added, and just general news
about the BBS. We'll divide it into two sections - BBS News and Net
News. With that said, away we go . . .  


BBS News: 

Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS is going to sponser a Legend of the Red
Dragon tournament! That's right, Seth Able's popular LORD game will be
used for the first in a series of game tournaments.

Entry fee into the tournament is $10.00/per person, and the winner
receives $25.00 in cash as well as mention in these electronic pages.

Everyone who enters receives access to the soon-to-be-installed second,
private note.

Download LORDCONT.ZIP for more details, or look for details on STTS BBS
or write to Joe DeRouen via any of the avenues mentioned elsewhere in
this issue under CONTACT POINTS. 

I've added a couple of new doors to the BBS. The Lost Lands (by David
Cooke) is a wonderfully inventive role playing game in the best
tradition of the old Infocom text adventures and Dungeons and Dragons.
It'll soon join the growing list of registered doors on the system.

The Online Legal Advisor (registered!) also joins the list of door games
and information doors.

The most popular download for February was SUN9402.ZIP, the February
issue of this magazine. Number two was RAH9402.ZIP, Dave Bealer's       
wonderfully funny humor magazine. Number three was MCI.ZIP,
a text file explaining MCI's new PC Connect plan. The fourth most
popular file was STTSINFO.ZIP, an old file explaining the concept and
execution of STTS Magazine. Fifth most popular was SM9402.ZIP, Lucia
Chamber's Jan. issue of Smoke & Mirrors magazine. Four of the top five
download were literature-related. Our callers know quality, that's for
sure! <Grin> 

The top five local message writers were 1) Joe DeRouen, 2) Shawn Aiken, 
3) Tommy Van Hook, 4) Heather DeRouen, and 5) Robert McKay.

Not counting myself, Tim Bellomy contributed the most uploads, followed
by Alissa Harvey, Don Bird, Sara Levinson, and Danny Grider.



Net News:   

We've now got STTS Magazine conferences on both Pen & Brush Net
and RIME. Check 'em out! (SysOps: Please consider picking up these
conferences. On RIME, the channel number is 448. On P&BNet, IF you're
using Postlink, it's 1108. If you're *not* using Postlink, ask your HUB
SysOp)

We've also added several new conferences from WME (thanks to finding a
local HUB, Tim Bellomy's Bucket Bored BBS) as well as a few from RIME.
As always, STTS BBS carries the full line up of Pen & Brush Net
conferences.  

The top five netmail message writers were 1) Lucia Chambers, 2) Joe
DeRouen, 3) Robert McKay, 4) Brian Whatcott, and 5) Michael Gibbs. 

The top five requested files via any of the nets on STTS was 1)
SUN9402.ZIP, 2) P&BPOST.ZIP (info packet on P&BNet), 3) RDRM30.ZIP
(ReadRoom v3.0 reading door), 4) SCRABFAQ.ZIP (text file on everything
you ever wanted to know about Scrabble), and 5) LITES29.ZIP (issue 29 of
Bruce Diamond's movie review elec. magazine LIGHTS OUT). 

All in all, February was a great month for the BBS. If there's anything
that wasn't covered in this column that you'd like to see covered next
month, drop me a line. 

The Question and Answers Session
Copyright (c) 1994, Joe DeRouen
All rights reserved


Each month, we'll ask a (hopefully) interesting question to users on
various nets and BBS's across the world and include the best answers
we get in this column.

This month's question: "What do you feel would be the single most
important thing that could be done to improve life in the United
States?"

The original message and responses are reproduced here in their
entirety, (Minus some quoting of the original question) with the
permission of the people involved. 

========================================================================  
========================================================================    

STTS Magazine readers,

The question for the QUESTION AND ANSWERS column in the March issue of
STTS Magazine is:

"What do you feel would be the single most important thing that could be
done to improve life in the United States?"


As always, good answers will be printed in the March issue of the
magazine. They may be edited for clarity (ie: quotes of this message
taken out) but will otherwise remain intact. By answering this message,
you give permission for STTS to publish your letter.

Thanks, and keep reading!

Joe DeRouen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joe,
   My reply to this is based on my own perception and beliefs.  I feel
that one of the sources of most of our problem is all aspects of life
deal with communication.  Communication breakdowns and barriers cause
many of the symptoms our society experiences.  Communication is more
that speaking or hearing, it's listening and getting accurate meaning,
it's seeing and understanding what we see, and it's feeling empathy not
sympathy for the people around us.  Maybe the scene from the play "Our
Town" by Thorton Wilder in which young Emily Webb, who died prematurely
at the age of 26, is allowed to return to earth from heaven one day will
illustrate what I mean.

To her mother and father this day is just another day in their life;
but, to Emily it is the only day that she has.  Because of her new
insights, Emily is distressed by her family's lack of genuine
communication and by the distracted, matter-of-fact manner of her
mother.  Finally in desperation she cries out:
     "Oh Mama, just look at me one minute as though you really saw
      me....Just for a moment now we're all together.....Let's look at
      one another."

We live our live as if they are filled with tomorrows never ending.
With all the hardships, and terrible things that are present
for each of us to cope with daily, how much better would all our lives
be if we would truly stop, "look" and "listen" to one another.

----Sylvia

        Stamp out the political correctness movement centering in
Austin Tx and reaching out to the four corners of this country.  It is
the most gross and over-popular forms of censorship I've seen in all my
days and, besides all of that, it cuts out most of my normal speech.
