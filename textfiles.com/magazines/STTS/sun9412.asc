Welcome

Welcome to Sunlight Through The Shadows magazine! In this issue, as well
as in the future, STTS will strive to bring you the best in fiction,
poetry, reviews, article, and other assorted reading material.

STTS Magazine has no general "theme" aside from good writing, innovative
concepts, and the unique execution of those concepts.

STTS wouldn't have been possible without the aid, support, and guidance
of three women:

Inez Harrison, publisher of Poetry In Motion newsletter. Her's was the
first electronic magazine I ever laid eyes upon, and also the first such
magazine to publish my work. She's given me advice, and, more
importantly, inspiration.

Lucia Chambers, publisher of Smoke & Mirrors Elec. Magazine and head of
Pen & Brush Network. She gave me advice on running a magazine,
encouragement, and hints as to the kind of people to look for in
writers.

Heather DeRouen, my wife. Listed last here, but always first in my
heart. She's proofread manuscripts, inspired me, listened to me, and,
most importantly, loved me. Never could I find a better woman to live
life by my side, nor a better friend.

Now that that's said and done... Again, welcome to Sunlight Through The
Shadows Magazine! I hope you enjoy it.

Joe DeRouen

The Following is a true story.  Completely, 100% true.  It explains
Sunlight Through The Shadow's absence from the electronic magazine racks
for the last month.  Read it at your own risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


At approximately 11:05pm on Oct. 31st, 1994, the offices of Sunlight
Through The Shadows were broken into.  Dozens of masked ninjas carrying
word processor and workgroups for windows were immediately upon us,
forcing us to the ground, ordering us to cover our heads with our hands.

They quickly bound and gagged us, ordering us to stay as quiet and
motionless as possible.  Being scared for our lives, of course we
complied.

The operation was flawless.  They were in and out inside of two minutes
flat.  No computers were stolen.  The CD collection was left intact.
Upon first inspection (after I managed to wriggle free from my bonds)
I'd curiously thought they'd failed to take anything.  Moments later,
I'd managed to free my companions of their bonds as well.

Confused and in shock, we stumbled to our collective feet, checked each  
other for fatalities (there were none) and breathed a deep sigh of
relief. 

Further inspection, though, revealed the awful, horrific truth: they'd
made copies of the current magazine - hours before distribution was to
begin! - and erased it from the hard drive.  A month's worth of work,
gone.  Like a wisp of smoke.  Destroyed.

"The Bastards!" Yelled Assistant Editor Shawn Aiken, immediately
reaching for his illegal copy of Word Perfect 6.1.  Loading the
formidable weapon in less time than it takes most people to say
"Putaki", Shawn was almost out the door and after our assailants before
I managed to grab his shoulder and spin him around.

"Shawn, man, it's not worth it."  I explained to him.  "These guys
could've killed us, and all they took was the magazine.  Let it be."

"But we put so much work into this!" He growled.  "My twelve part essay
on the explanation of the beginning of life!  The first chapter in that
new novel you just sold to Doubleday for 1.2 million!"

"My lengthy and verbose analyzation of all of Shakespeare's sonnets and
poems. . ." Chimed in house poet Tamara.  

"My reviews of the last fifty years in movies, complete with footnotes
and biographies on every actor and actress that appeared in each movie,
down to the guy that got killed in the opening scene of the rarely
viewed thriller GOOD GUYS DON'T WEAR POLYESTER. . ." Added Bruce
Diamond, our erstwhile movie critic.

"What about MY work?" Interjected Heather DeRouen, face in tears.  "I'd
finally completed the essay that would cure all diseases, end nuclear
build up, and put a chicken in every pot.  And it's gone!  All gone!"

All eyes turned to the door, upon which a soft knock was heard to
emanate.  

"Was that a soft knock emanating from the door?"  I asked, instantly
knowing it was.

"I think it was."  Answered Shawn, his ire gone for the moment.  "Well,
maybe we should answer it."

"What if it's those ninjas back to finish the job?"  Trembled Bruce,
brandishing a pair of deadly spiked movie passes.  "They won't get away
with this."

The knock rang through again, accompanied by a voice:  "Joe, it's me.
Tommy.  Got room in the magazine for a few reviews and sports articles? 
I know it's late, but. . ."

I ran to the door, swept it upon, and pulled Tommy Van Hook inside.
"How many reviews, Tommy, how many reviews?"  I asked him, madness
creeping into my voice.

Backing up, looking confused, he managed a half-smile.  "Four or five.
And some poetry too.  And a couple of sports articles.  And . . ."

His words were cut off by the group hug that ensued, as we all ran to
embrace the last minute gift from the god of electronic magazines.
"Yes, we have room!"  I exclaimed, thinking that, with Tommy's material,
we just might recoup and be able to put out a double issue in time for
December!  

"I'm the God of Electronic Magazine's gift?"  Smiled Tommy, drowning in the
arms of our affection.  "Cool."

"He didn't actually *say* that."  Heather said.  "Look up.  He only
*thought* it.  We wouldn't want you to get too big of a head."

Tamara smiled, and nodded.  "You know, for this timely intervention we
should probably make Tommy a member of the staff."

"I second that motion!"  Yelled Bruce, putting away his deadly spiked
movie passes.  

"Done!"  I smiled, laying hands on the surprised Mr. Van Hook.  A ball
of blue light moved down my arm, swelled, and entered into the new
Poetry Editor's chest.  After that, things were never the same.  

We won't get into Sunlight Through The Shadow's recent application for
bankruptcy due to Tommy's demands of exorbitant fees, nor shall we get
into who was ultimately behind the ninja's theft.  That shall remain
another story, for another time.


 
 

  The Staff and Contributing Writers of Sunlight Through The Shadows

  The Staff
  ---------

  Joe DeRouen............................Publisher and Editor
  L. Shawn Aiken.........................Assistant Editor   

  Heather DeRouen........................Book Reviews
  Bruce Diamond..........................Movie Reviews
  Tamara.................................House Poet
  Thomas Van Hook........................Poetry Editor


  Joe DeRouen publishes, edits, and writes for STTS magazine. He's had
  poetry and fiction published in several on-line magazines and a few
  paper publications as well. He's written exactly 1.5 novels, none of
  which, alas, have seen the light of publication. He attends college
  part-time in search of that always-elusive english degree. In his
  spare time, he enjoys reading, running his BBS, collecting music,
  playing with his five cats, singing opera, hunting pseudopods, and
  most importantly spending time with his beautiful wife Heather.

  L. Shawn Aiken dropped out of college when he realized that they  
  couldn't teach him the two things he wanted to do; live successfully,
  and write.  He had to find out these things all by himself on the
  road.  Thus he became a road scholar.  After spending his life hopping
  country to country, state to state, he now feels confident in his
  abilities and is working on his literary career.  His main endevour is
  to become successful in the speculative fiction area, but he enjoys
  writing all forms of literary art.

  Heather DeRouen writes software for the healthcare industry, CoSysOps
  Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS, enjoys playing with her five cats,
  cross-stitching, and reading. Most of all, she enjoys spending time
  with her dapper, charming, witty, and handsome (not to mention modest)
  husband Joe. Heather's help towards editing and proofreading this
  magazine has been immeasurable.

  Bruce Diamond, part-time pseudopod and ruler of a small island chain
  off the coast of Chil‚, spends his time imitating desk lamps when he
  isn't watching and critiquing movies for LIGHTS OUT, his BBS movie
  review publication (now syndicated to over 20 boards).  Recently,
  Bruce became the monthly movie critic for VALLEY REVIEW MAGAZINE,
  published out of Pennsylvania.  LIGHTS OUT, now two years old, is
  available through the Rime or P&B Networks by dropping a note to
  Joe DeRouen, courtesy of Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS.  The
  magazine will soon be available through Fido file request and
  Internet FTP.  In the Dallas area, Bruce's distributor is Jay
  Gaines' BBS AMERICA (214-994-0093).  Bruce is a freelance writer
  and video producer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

  There is very little known about Tamara, and she prefers to let it
  remain that way. She's a woman of mystery and prefers to remain hidden
  in the shadows of the BBS world. (Enigmatic, don't you think?)

  Thomas Van Hook resides in Dallas, where he works as a contract  
  employee for the Federal Reserve Automation Services.  Having served
  eight years in the USAF, he is happy to finally be free and able to
  pursue the dreams of his heart.  At the age of 29, he is looking
  forward to many new adventures and experiences within the realms of
  the Elven kind.  He enjoys reading, writing, sports of all kinds, his
  son Corey and the attentions of any Elven women that seem interested
  (not necessarily in that order).  Recently divorced, he is trying to
  restore order and balance to his life without losing what little is
  left of his sanity.

  Robin Aiken is an aspiring biologist who wants to write the poignant
  story of a young boy and his genetically engineered fungus entitled
  Skippy and the Slime Mold of Death.  She is still in college and has
  never published anything (but she has written some mighty fine
  limmericks on the bathroom walls of your finer eating establishments).
  Her hobbies include watching the X-files and sympathizing with Fox
  Mulder, collecting turnips that resemble various politicians,
  attempting to eat her own weight in chocolate at least once a year,
  plotting to take over the world, and spreading happiness and joy to
  all those who deserve it.  That's all she wrote. 
 
  Debbie Burns resides in Howe, Texas, on the far edge of reality.  Her
  days are filled with reading, rollerblading, and picking smashed bits
  of Cheerios from the carpet after her twins have gone to bed.  Debbie
  attended Arkansas College for one year and intends to return to
  college in Austin when her daughters are in school.  Planning her
  upcoming marriage to Maggie and Kate's father is a time-consuming but,
  she comments, "it sure is less frustrating than changing two diapers
  at once!"

  Ed Davis has been scribbling seriously or has at least enjoyed the
  electronic equivalent, since 1981. Prior to that, his literary efforts
  were confined to whatever scrap paper he could find on a work bench at
  break or lunch time, since he was spending his working hours making
  chips and money in the guise of a Journeyman Machinist.  Married to
  the same lady for 26 years and with two children still hovering
  uncomfortably close to the nest, Ed continues to write down his
  thoughts electronically. Check out the file NEWBOOK.ZIP, available
  from STTS BBS, for more of his work.

  Sean A. Donahue does not have any publishing ties whatsoever.  He has
  written over 4,192 poems.  Only 38 have seen to survive the Mighty
  Morphin Power Rangers.  The time in which normal people say is spare,
  he tries to use to study for school at Texas Tech University.  This is
  Sean's first published poem and he hopes that it is not his last.  He
  has written exactly 428 novels all starting with "It was a dark and
  stormy night."  None ofthem have gotten past the second paragraph.  In
  whatever time he has left, he enjoys reading, riting, and rithmatic. 
  He has an creative writing minor, a history minor, and a Honorary
  Doctorate in B.S. from Bowling Green State University.  He dedicates
  his writing to those who are without love and hope.  And that's no
  B.S. 

  Grant Guenther, sometimes known as J. Guenther, confesses to be from a
  long-lost Martian colony, but in-depth investigations reveals that he
  was born and raised in a small but well-to-do community called
  Hartland in Wisconsin.  A senior, he has written several collections
  of poems, and won many awards from his high school literary magazine,
  including 1st place for poetry and short-short fiction.  He is the
  editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and writes as a humor
  columnist (or at least he thinks so).

  At the tender age of 35, Dale E. Lehman is already a veteran systems
  analyst, father, zookeeper, and rejection slip collector.  He
  specializes in SF, fantasy, and mysteries, with one completed novel
  looking for an agent, four fragmentary novels in progress, and oodles
  of short stories all crammed into a tiny filing cabinet.  With the
  help of his personal editor/reference librarian/wife, he is not only
  supporting a writing habit but also five children, one dog, and a
  wildly fluctuating number of demon cats.  He ap plies any leftover
  time to reading and playing chess--not generally at the sam e time,
  though. 

  Daniel Sendecki is a young, emerging, Canadian writer who lives 
  in Burlington, Ontario.  Currently, Daniel is pursuing his writing 
  interests at home but intends to study literature at McGill 
  University, in Montreal, Quebec.  

  Louis Turbeville currently works as a computer analyst for the Air  
  Force.  He's originally from Hawaii (about an 1/8 Hawaiian <everyone
  seems to ask>) and has a BBA in Management Information Systems from the
  University of Hawaii.  Louis is married and has a two year old son who
  keeps him busy, especially when he wants to sit at the computer and
  write.  His interest in writing was nurtured by his wife, a journalism
  and english major who's yet to be published and holds this very much
  against Louis. <G>  He's had a couple of reviews published on
  WindowsOnLine Review Magazine and hopes to broaden his base of published
  media in the near future. 

  Jeremy Yocum suffers daily from pain and torture forced upon him by
  the government, by means of a horrid torture device known as Public
  School.  (Never get School and Education mixed up--the two have very
  little to do with one another)  Writing is only one of the many ways,
  and not even the foremost, for him to escape into the real world.
  Jeremy also sings in the school choir at Newman Smith High School,
  plays guitar in a Christian band known as Presence, and then fiddles
  in his spare time with writing and visual art.  Every once in a while,
  when he feels he has truly written something half worthy to be
  published, he humbly submits his amateur work to Joe DeRouen.  None of
  his works have ever previously been published.

Joe, 

Where's the november issue of STTS?  I've looked everywhere and I can't
seem to find it!  Is it still being published?  Please write me and let
me know!

Thanks,

Karen Brock-Anderson
Chicago, Il.  

(I've already written you back, Karen.  But for those who were 
 wondering the same thing, check out this month's editorial.  It's
 all true.  100%.  <G> -Ed.)

Dear Editor;

I used to be overweight, have pimples, and live the life of a hermit.
Then I discovered Sunlight Through The Shadows.  It has changed my life.
I'm now a Paris high fashion model earning over a million dollars a 
year.  I'm also engaged to one of the Kennedys.  (Discretion prevents me
from saying which one.)

Thank you for changing my life.

Sincerely,

Janna Finkelstein
Paris, France

(This is a real letter.  We think it's a joke, but you never know for
 sure.  Thanks for writing, Janna!  If nothing else, you amused us
 greatly! -Ed.)

If you're having a problem you just can't seem to solve, a question you
want answered, or just an inherent need to bend a lonely writer's ear,
you've come to the right place.  Response has been great!  Keep those
cards and letters coming, folks.  But, please, don't send cash. 


Q: Which CD-ROM drive should I buy?  I have a 50 Mhz 80486 and would
   really like to try out some of those CDs I've been hearing about. 
   The triple-speed CD-ROM drive sounds better, of course, but it's also
   about three times the price of the single-speed version.  Should I go
   between the two and get a double-speed?  Is there really that big of
   a difference? 

   Brad Landsbaum
   Farmer's Branch, Texas


A: Actually, there is.  In this particular case, the old axiom of 
   "buy the very best you can afford" rings true.  Single-speed
   systems are outdated and should be avoided altogether.  They 
   won't run a lot of the newer CDs out there or, if they do, 
   performance time will be drastically reduced.  There's very few
   packages that won't run on a double-speed system, but, once again,
   you can suffer speed problems if your disk is particulary
   read-intensive.

   If you can afford it, buy the triple-speed CD-ROM drive.  You won't
   have any problems running your CDs, and you'll be state of the art
   for at least a week or two.  There's always something better on the
   horizon, but if we all waited and waited we'd still be shooting 
   asteroids on our Atari 2600s.  


Q: I've managed to subscribe to some lists and electronic magazines
   through the Internet, and some of them seem to come through okay,
   but others come through in this strange hieroglyphic-like state
   of being.  The message that accompanies the file says it's been
   encoded.                

   Linda Anne Smith
   Ft. Worth, Texas


A: Ah, the Internet.  So large.  So many resources.  So confusing.  Most
   files transferred through the internet can't be carried as-is, and
   need to be converted from binary code into ASCII.  That's where
   UUENCODE.EXE comes in.  UUENCODE takes the file, converts it to an
   ASCII representation of the binary file, and prepares it for travel
   via Internet electronic mail.  Unless your system is set up to
   automatically decode incoming files (some are) you'll wind up with a
   file you have absolutely no idea what to do with. 

   How do you decode the file into something useful?  UUDECODE.EXE, of
   course.  UUDECODE is the companion to UUENCODE, and extremely vital
   if you plan to subscribe to lists or FTP through Internet e-mail. 

   Execute the program from the DOS command line for instructions on 
   it's use.  While it's uses are indeed many, it isn't too hard to
   learn the tricks of using UUDECODE.  If you can't find the file
   on your local BBS or Internet site, please feel welcome to download
   it from the "Free Files" section of STTS BBS.  The phone number is,
   as always, at the end of the column.  


Q: Everyone keeps telling me I need to optimize my hard drive.  I have
   no idea how to do this, or even what it is.  Please, help me.

   Robin Bryant
   Grand Prairie, Texas

A: Optimizing (defragging, defragmenting, etc.) your hard drive is
   amazingly simple, and definitely something you need to do at least
   a couple times a month.  But I digress.

   First, an explanation.  When you write files to your hard drive, it 
   does everything on a first-come first-served basis.  Whatever sectors
   happen to be available to be used are the ones your computer uses.

   Straightforward enough so far.  The reason for optimization lies in
   exactly how those bits and bytes are stored.  When you delete, for
   example, a 500k file, 500k of space becomes available for use on your
   hard disk.  Let's imagine that you then download a 1 meg GIF of your
   favorite supermodel from your local Mega BBS.  Your system saves the
   first 500k of that GIF to the aforementioned free space and writes
   the rest of the file to the next available space - more than likely
   not together.  This doesn't really hurt anything, but it does slow
   down load time and file access to the hard drive.  Over time, with
   files stored haphazardly all over your disk, it can cause problems
   and severely affect your system's performance. 

   You need to optimize your hard drive a couple of times a month, more
   as a preventative measure than anything else.  Optimizing scans your
   disk and moves the files to contiguous sectors, thus saving valuable
   seconds in loading and access time and, more importantly, safeguards
   against even worse fragmentation in the future. 

   DOS comes with a file called DEFRAG.EXE.  Use this or one of the 
   commercial Hard Disk tool packages (NORTON UTILITIES or PC TOOLS) 
   and you shouldn't have any problems.  Follow the on-line instructions
   and your hard drive should be frag-free in no time!

Currents or via Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS at 214/620-8793.

The Sports Page

All rights reserved


Welcome to yet another edition of the Sunlght Through The Shadows
Sports Page!  It's a strange world out there in sports, so let's
all pretend to understand it, shall we?

Let us start in the defunct world of Major League Baseball. 
Interesting enough, the have been now major developments
concerning the strike that has cost the fans the enjoyment of a
World Series in 1994.  Owners and players seem to be very
uninterested in speaking with one another during this off-season
period, which has prompted the Federal Government to officially
step in as a mediator.  Let's just hope that the Clinton
administration doesn't screw these talks up as bad as they
screwed up the Haitian situation.  Then again, you never know. 
Most of the teams are opting players that are in the last year of
their contract to the minor leagues.  Most players are refusing
the assignment, thus designating themselves as unrestricted free
agents.

We continue our trek through the sweaty socks of the jock world
with a stop in the world of Football.  Personally, I don't really
care for this sport, but I'll give a brief run-down anyway.  If
you had doubts about the Dallas Cowboys three-peating their way
to the Superbowl title this year...leave those doubts at home. 
The season is almost half over now and the Cowboys are the most
dominant football team on the planet right now.  As for my pre-
season predictions that appeared in an earlier edition of this E-
mag, well when you don't like football...you generally don't
follow all the teams that close (grin).  But seriously, I am not
the only individual in the sports world that is shocked over the
play of the LA Raiders.  Almost everybody picked them to take it
all this year...except most of the sports writers in Dallas.

With Football behind us now, we move forward to the realm of Sir
Chrales Barkley...namely:  Basketball.  This year looks to be the
most exciting year in the NBA since the rookie seasons of Larry
Bird and Earvin "Magic" Johnson.  A lot of people are putting the
pressure on the Pheonix Suns by claiming another championship for
them before the season has gotten underway.  However, Shaquille
O'Neal and the Orlando Magic are going to be standing in their
way this year.  There is no doubt that this is the most powerful
Orlando Magic team to step onto the court in their franchise
history.  Let's just hope that all the pieces are together for
them this year.  And guess what Dallas Mavericks fans?  Roy
Tarpley is back!  Yes sir, that is correct!  Roy Tarpley is back
and the Dallas police force is on the watch for his drunken
driving antics again!  The only difference between the last time
Roy was here and this time, is that rookie Jason Kidd is even
more reckless than Tarpley and should take some of the off-court
heat off of Roy.  I really wonder if the Mavericks are building
their their foundation on rock or sand?  Time will tell.

And last, but not least, we entertain the world of "boxing-on-
ice:"  the domain of Hockey.  At one time, the players and owners
were ready to agree on a collective bargaining agreement.  Look
out!  The NHL Commisioner stepped in, pulled the two sides apart
and sent the fans to the penalty box by forcing a lockout on the
beginning of this season.  From this point, the players and
owners have slowly drifted apart and it looks like we might have
a repeat of what is going on in Baseball right now.  I am not
really sure I like the looks of this mess, and I have a hunch
that the Commisioner is just setting himself up to be the fall
guy in this whole thing.

Oh yeah, one final note in closing.  The tennis world needs to be
on the lookout for bad-girl Jennifer Capriati's return to the
game.  A lot of people are saying that she might not make it.  I
have my fingers crossed for her.  She's had enough bad luck in
her world lately.  And after she gets successful, maybe she can
start dating me.  After all, I'm just a single guy waiting to
shower love and affection on the nearest wealthy lady.  What's
that Joe?  Jennifer wouldn't want another run of bad luck with
me.  Thanks a bunch there guy!  Just shatter my dreams.  And I
bet the next thing you're going to tell me is that Lisa Marie
Presley just got married.  She did?  To Michael Jackson?  I think
I'm going to be sick.

Till next month....

Opening a Gateway to the Internet:
An Interview with Will Bunker
Copyright (c) 1994, L. Shawn Aiken
All rights reserved



        Imagine a world brimming over with data.  Data you need - whether it
be for business or pleasure.  And imagine everybody in that world, screaming
at the tops of their lungs, in a language you don't understand.  That's the
Internet.  And even if you have the money and the time to deal with it, it is
still an awful mess.
        On October 6, 1994, I interviewed Will Bunker, a pioneer in the field
of bringing the Internet in a cheap and user friendly package to your
electronic doorstep.  Mr. Bunker is the Sysop of the International On-line
Service, located in Dallas, Texas, and has done more in life than just stare
at a computer, getting screen burn on his retinas.
            

STTS: What kinds of experience and training do you have on computers?

Mr. Bunker: I started playing around with them in college.  My major was 
Industrial Engineering and we had a few projects.  When I moved to Dallas, I 
picked up a Computer Currents and was fascinated by BBSes.  Then I spent a 
year and a half in exile in Russia working.  There I ran across GLASNET 
(Russian Internet) and learned more about the medium.  On my vacation I 
starting reading "Boardwatch" and began to put together a business plan - and 
the International On-line Service is the result of that.  We started in 
January and after many rabbit trails we have arrived today with an Internet 
service that I hope people can enjoy.

STTS: Where are you originally from?

Mr. Bunker: A small town called Lake Village, Arkansas.  It is on the border 
wit Mississippi where I went to high school and college.

STTS: So how did you get to Dallas, and when?

Mr. Bunker: I interviewed with my company in 1992 and moved here in the 
summer of '92.

STTS: And which company was that?

Mr. Bunker: Well, it is a small group of private companies owned by N.B. 
Hunt.  The first one that I worked with was a natural resources outfit (Hunt 
Exploration and Mining Company) and that is how I ended up in Russia.

STTS: Natural Resources?  Oil and gas, perhaps?

Mr. Bunker: Mostly oil and a gas, but we all so looked at a few mineral 
projects in some of the Republics over there.

STTS: Where were you 'stationed'?

Mr. Bunker: I lived in Moscow, but spent about 25% of my time on the road 
visiting various places and running the numbers on the projects that we 
looked at.  None of which were that attractive considering the vast risks 
involved.

STTS: Do you learn to speak Russian, or did the Russians speak English?

Mr. Bunker: I learned conversational Russian while I was there but I it is 
fading fast.  I had a really good interpreter that went everywhere with me 
to keep me out of trouble, but towards the end I started actually having 
conversations with people and it was pretty neat.  The only thing that I 
regret about leaving is not finishing learning how to speak.  Oh well, since 
it is so rough there I probably won't need it again anyway.

STTS: What places did you visit?

Mr. Bunker: I saw quite a few. Arkangel in the north.  Kyrgyistan, Kazakstan, 
Azerbejan, Uzbekistan in the south.  Chelyabinsk, and Magnitagorsk in the 
Urals.  Siberia, even Kamchatka and Vladivistok.  I didn't spend any time in 
the middle portion or in Ukraine or Bylorussia.

STTS: Quite a few of those places are in civil war.  Did you have to dodge 
any bullets?

Mr. Bunker: I was there during the coup attempt but my apartment was not 
around the Parliament building, although I could hear the tanks firing.  More 
of a threat was the organized crime although I was fortunate that they never 
zeroed in on me.

STTS: What exactly was you job there?

Mr. Bunker: I guess you could call me the Project Manager.  I was in charge 
of the Russians in the sense that I had to make sure that their numbers 
matched Western economics.

STTS: As opposed to 'Eastern economics'?

Mr. Bunker: Yes, they considered a project with payout where you get all the 
money back eventually.  With no interest.  So you really had to be careful 
not to take the feasibility studies too seriously.

STTS: All those years of communism I guess.  They had no business skills?

Mr. Bunker: They had plenty of business skills, just not in the same way that 
we think of.  They could overcome tremendous obstacles that their environment 
(social, political, etc. ) placed in their way.  Yet that would not translate 
to me asking money in a way that would benefit a traditional business in our 
sense.

STTS: Was it a matter of corruption, or just socialist ideas of production, 
rather than a 'for profit' motive?

Mr. Bunker: All of the above.  They probably were closer to being a mafia 
state than a true communistic state.  The KGB is not really much different 
than organized crime.  Nor has it really changed now.  It is just a little 
more chaotic.  Those that have power receive all of the benefits leaving 
very little for anyone else.  At least that is how it appears to some looking 
in from the outside.

STTS: Was it hard to accomplish your objectives?

Mr. Bunker: Extremely.  They just don't have the infrastructure that we take 
for granted.  Telephones, business equipment, airports, hotels, roads, cars, 
banking, law, etc.  You name it and they don't have it.

STTS: Was the Russian Internet up to western standards?

Mr. Bunker: Glasnet is pretty cool.  It is basically a USENET feed that comes 
off of a satellite.  They have 3 phone lines and you must go to their office 
and give them roubles in advance to set up an account.  It allowed me to 
receive news much faster that most people unless they had CNN of course.  It 
was quite interesting to see the Internet work so well in a place so remote.

STTS: What kind of hardware did it use?  Did it have a good storage ability?

Mr. Bunker: I think it was a group of 486's and seemed to keep messages about 
2 weeks which was enough for me.  It sounds so primitive here, but there it 
was really awesome.  I remember many a winter night rummaging through 
newsgroups learning a about different things.

STTS: When did you first get into BBSing?

Mr. Bunker: The summer of 92 before I left Dallas, I began to call BBSes 
that were listed in the back of "Computer Currents".  I pretty much dropped 
it until I found Glasnet in Fall of 93.  Then I really got involved in 
January of this year as I started to put this thing together.

STTS: How did this IOS thing come about?  Where did the idea come from?  How 
did you get it together?

Mr. Bunker: The idea came from "Boardwatch", which I picked up in April of 
'93.  I thought a lot about it as I traveled around in Russia.  I talked my 
boss into giving it shot in December of '93.  Then we started doing the 
feasibility in January of this year.

STTS: And who is your boss?  Is this company affiliated? 

Mr. Bunker: Yes IOS is a part of the N.B.  Hunt group.  I pretty much run the 
thing, but with all of the expenses I couldn't fund it myself.  So, I work 
for IOS and set the pace on trying to make a go of it.

STTS: And what is the philosophy behind IOS?

Mr. Bunker: Well, right now we are trying to put together an interface for 
the Internet that will allow the average person to jump on, find their area 
of interest, access the information, and jump off.

STTS: There are several systems that give access to the Internet.  How is IOS
different?

Mr. Bunker: Our interface uses RIP and ANSI screens.  This means that someone 
can spend $8/month, no up-front software cost or learning curve, and test 
the Internet.  I hope that this will allow many more people the opportunity 
to see what it is all about without having blow their budget on it.

STTS: How does the interface work?

Mr. Bunker: At present we are using Galacticomm and it runs off of a DOS 
computer.  We are going to roll out a pure UNIX system this month that will 
generate RIP screens.  I think that it will really knock people's socks off.  
Still, at present we have a system that will allow people to browse by area 
of interest, as well as search by topic, using standard Internet tools such 
as Veronica, etc., without having to know too much about them.

STTS: How much of the Internet can be accessed?

Mr. Bunker: We have everything but USENET right now.  So I would say 50-60% 
of the information can be seen through the setup that we have now.

STTS: How does the system work?

Mr. Bunker: Well right now we are running it off of a Galacticomm platform 
on a Novell network.  The server is TCP/IP compatible and that is how we 
bridge to the Internet.

STTS: I've read all about those thing, but since I haven't seen them, I 
forgot exactly what they were.  It's a bridge to the net, right, but at what 
level?

Mr. Bunker: Well, all the net really is, is a group of computers with wires 
running to each other.  The language that they speak is called TCP/IP.  If 
you have the wire an and the protocol then you are officially on the 
Internet.  At least that is what they tell me.  It seems to work fine for us 
so I guess that I believe them.

STTS: What does the USENET have?

Mr. Bunker: It is a collection of discussion groups that are transmitted 
along the wires (sort of like UPI or AP) to all the computers that wish to 
subscribe.  It provides a lot of bulk and interaction to the whole thing.

STTS: So those are the message boards and news boards?

Mr. Bunker: Yes, together they are collectively called USENET.

STTS: Are you planning to get the USENET, or not?

Mr. Bunker: Yes, it should be up and running in a week or so .  We didn't 
start with it because so many BBSes already have USENET via Planet Connect 
and friends. We wanted to start with the harder to find interactive features.

STTS: Is FIDO a USENET feature, or is it something else?

Mr. Bunker: FIDONET runs the same concept, but the phone lines are not 
connected 24 hours day.  It is received in a burst once or twice a day.  Same 
thing but different implementation.

STTS: What sorts of things are available via IOS on the Internet. ?

Mr. Bunker: Well we have all the gopher sites available which include a 
tremendous amount of information.  You can also call any computer that is 
hooked up (TELNET) this includes FedWorld.  You can also transfer files from 
anonymous sites which allows you access to the Terabytes of information.  
There are several search tools to allow you to search the entire space.  FTP 
is the hardest tool to use in my opinion.  You have a to know a few UNIX 
commands to make it behave.  I have several screens in the beginner area that 
spell out step by step how to retrieve a file using FTP.  It is not easy but 
I guess the people that designed were not too worried about that.

STTS: What are the other section of IOS, other than the Internet access?

Mr. Bunker: We have several other systems.  They include business, author's 
net, UFOs and patents.  Quite an eclectic sort.

STTS: And these systems are individual BBSes located in IOS itself?

Mr. Bunker: Yes, they are individual BBSes run by a pretty great group of 
people.

STTS: How do these BBSes operate?

Mr. Bunker: We have local access numbers across the country.  They signed up 
in order to get exposure across the country.  We tried to recreate the look 
and feel within the constraints of running different software to allow their 
long distance user to access them a little cheaper.

STTS: When was IOS first set up?

Mr. Bunker: We started recruiting in April of this year and implemented in 
June and added Internet last month.

STTS: Recruiting employees?

Mr. Bunker: No, BBSes to add content.

STTS: I thought IOS had been around for a longer.  In another form?

Mr. Bunker: Yes as a limited test BBS.  But it took a long time to negotiate 
the phone contract for the local access numbers.  That was the biggest hurdle 
to getting in the business.

STTS: Is that set up like the large systems, like Prodigy, Compuserve, and 
AOL?

Mr. Bunker: Yes but we have a smaller area of coverage, naturally.

STTS: How many lines do you have into the system?

Mr. Bunker: Counting the network lines from other cities, there are 
approximately 180 phone lines coming in at this time.

STTS: And how many users can access the system at one time?

Mr. Bunker: It depends on what they are all doing.  Since I placed the system 
on the Novell network I think it could handle 150 before starting to bog 
down, but it is rank speculation at this time.

STTS: I go crazy on systems so spend all my money on them.  If I could 
somehow regulate my time on - kick me off at a pre-arranged time.  I don't 
suppose this system does that?

Mr. Bunker: Yes actually we do.  For the Dallas user the $8 get them 2 hours 
a day.  The system automatically removes them at the end of the time so they 
don't have to worry about running up a bill.

STTS: Is there any way someone who wanted more time could get it?

Mr. Bunker: Yes $16 will get you 4 hours a day, etc.

STTS: What kind of technical support do you give?

Mr. Bunker: Well, we are available from 8am to 6pm to field questions in 
person by calling (214) 979-9072 and on-line most of the evening.  Then the 
user can send us e-mail asking any question.  So far there haven't been that 
many questions, precisely because people are using software that they know 
and love.

STTS: So can any communication software access IOS?

Mr. Bunker: Well if it has text, ANSI, or RIP interface then they can reach 
us and use the Internet.

STTS: At what speeds (BPS) does IOS run?

Mr. Bunker: Our Dallas numbers are 14.4.  The nation-wide numbers are 
typically 9600, but we also have a few dreaded 2400 out there in some cities.

STTS: Does IOS have Internet E-mail?

Mr. Bunker: Yes and no.  Yes we have it on our UNIX machine, but we are 
waiting on some cable in order to bridge it over to the system so all our 
users can have it.  I hope to have it on-line by Monday.

STTS: Will there be a menu driven editor for the Email, or will it be 
operated by the UNIX commands?

Mr. Bunker: I think that it will be sent straight from the standard Email 
area. The system will know based on the address.

STTS: About the USENET, are you going to have all groups on it, or are you 
going to leave out certain things, like the really weird ALT groups?

Mr. Bunker: Probably leave out a few, due to personal tastes of my employers.  
We are currently developing a total graphic front end to map the newsgroups 
according to topic.  It will run straight off of the UNIX system.  I think 
the look will blow people away, but here again, it is not working today.  So 
we will just have to wait and see when we can bring it on-line.

STTS: When is it projected to come on-line?

Mr. Bunker: The developer has it up and running on a 486 using just using 
UNIX, but in order to make it technically feasible it has to be moved to our 
UNIX system.  He is doing that now, but there is no way to predict all the 
difficulties until he tries to run it.  I think in 3 weeks we will have it 
ready for people to start calling.

STTS: What sorts of things will be left out of the USENET?  Is there a sort 
of 'family values' philosophy behind it, or something else?

Mr. Bunker: Well, basically since the family has such a high profile, we 
aren't going to   carry anything that would get our faces on 'Hardcopy' and 
such for polluting young minds.  I personally don't see too much wrong with a 
lot of it, but the legal issues are real and we would rather stay away from 
the controversy.

STTS: There are mild forms of adult things, though.  Will there be some sort 
of 'age screen' to keep the children out of areas that aren't too bad, but 
could receive an 'R' rating?

Mr. Bunker: I would like to do it that way.  It will take more time to set 
up but I think it will be worth it.  There are many people who don't want 
their children exposed and I don't blame them.  Yet you want to appeal to 
the broad market so we will have differentiate.

STTS: Is IRC available on IOS?

Mr. Bunker: Not yet, but it will be on the UNIX system.  I think it is one of 
the coolest things out there.

STTS: What sorts of things are available on IRC?

Mr. Bunker: IRC is a global chat.  So it is no different than chat here, just 
you have hundreds of people on-line all the time so it is pretty cool.

STTS: Is there any way to gain emergency extra time other than paying for 
another 'level' that month?

Mr. Bunker: Yes you could sign up for the non-local account.  It is $8/month 
for 2 hours then every hour after that is $3.50/hour with no limit.

STTS: Where does IOS fit into the over-all scheme of Internet servers?

Mr. Bunker: We think that our niche will be providing a road map for people 
to travel the Internet.

STTS: For that you need explorers.  Is that what you do?

Mr. Bunker: Yes I spend a lot of my time exploring but we will need to find 
others to help as we go along.  John, our UNIX man, has mapped 4,000 
newsgroups, but there  is so much more that it will take a team to do it all.

STTS: Is IOS a kind of travel agent, providing people with maps and booking 
on flights and what not?  Is that an accurate description?

Mr. Bunker: Yes, although my analogy is that of a TV company.  Anyone can set 
up an Internet connection.  It is creating interesting programming that will 
make the whole thing entertaining and useful for the average person.  So as 
long as people like our programming they will tune into our channel.  The 
resources are the same for every provider, just the slant on their interface 
and destinations.

STTS: So what is your favorite part of IOS - what do you use on it?

Mr. Bunker: I love cruising gophers, but I think that MUD are the king.  This 
weekend I am going to put together a list of 40 MUDs and make them available 
from the top Internet menu.  I think people will love them.

STTS: Is there anything else about IOS that I have failed to ask about?

Mr. Bunker: No that about covers it.  It is simple yet extremely complex.  It 
just takes time to build it up, which we are doing every day.  I added a 
non-profit resource area in my Browsing section today.  Tomorrow it is MUDs.  
The next - who knows?

STTS: So IOS will be growing on and on in an attempt to deliver the Internet?

Mr. Bunker: Yes.  The day our programming stops people will get tired and 
tune in somewhere else.

STTS: Well, Thank you for letting me interview you in your valuable time.

        I was hoping to come back from Stellar Occasion '94 with all sorts of 
neat things to tell you.  Regretfully, I missed most of the Con.  Caught the 
tail end, though.  But it was not what I was hoping for - my first time out.
        I've never been to a science fiction convention, you see.  I was 
hoping to experience one.  All of one.  Alas, the great rains hit.  You know 
that storm that sent Houston and the surrounding bits under water?  Not that 
one.  The smaller one that hit Dallas a few days later.
        It wasn't a big flood.  I've been in those.  Back in Houston.  In the 
'70s.  When you see your neighbors going to the 7-11 in canoes, you know it 
is bad.  Dallas just experienced a flash flood this time around.  A few 
people washed away down the Trinity River and never seen again.  Small 
potatoes.
        It did not matter that the flood was on Friday and the Con was on 
Saturday and Sunday.  It still got the car.  The alternator on the car drank 
all the water it could and then went on the fritz.  So much for Japanese 
technology vs. Texas thunderstorms.
        Anyway, the car was off-line.  I sat there and lamented.  My first 
Con and this happens.  I've been a science fiction fan all of my life.  I 
was brought up on Star Trek, Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, and the like.  But I 
never felt a compunction to go to a Con.  Buncha weird people, I always 
thought.  Dressed up to the hilt in Spock ears.  Goofy.  Sure, I can go and 
memorize every line in the original Star Trek series - but I don't want to 
meet people who do the same.
        But times - and people - change.  I wanted to see.  Observe what all 
the hubbub was about.  A little bit.  But the real reason I had in mind was 
to see the experts.  People like G. Harry Stine, who has written for Analog 
magazine since God created cheese.  And William Gaubatz, Director-Program 
Manager for the Delta Clipper rocket.  A whole slew of experts in the space 
field talking for two days straight, in conferences such as "Space 
Settlement" and "Fork Fights in Zero-G."  My kinda stuff.
        J. Michael Straczynski was there, giving a six hour workshop on 
scriptwiritng.  Being a writer, and knowing nothing about scriptwriting, I 
figured it would be invaluable.  Even if Straczynski had come up with 
"Captain Power."  You remember it.  That show where you could show at people 
on the screen?  Well, perhaps you don't remember . . .
        But NOOOOO.  The rain in Spain falls mainly in Texas, damaging 
Japanese auto parts.  I finally did make it - on Sunday - Sunday afternoon - 
to be precise.  Thirty bucks for my sister and I to enter.  But I had to go.  
Even if I had missed everything interesting, I still had to go.  Don't ask 
why.
        First thing we see is a guy in a Starfleet uniform wandering out of 
the hotel.  "God," my sister muttered.  I wasn't surprised.  You were 
supposed to see that kind of thing there.  I would have felt cheated if I 
hadn't.
        Surprisingly, there were very few people all dressed up.  One woman 
was particularly striking.  She was dressed up as one of those races in 
"Babylon 5."  The bald ones.  Not the reptilian bald ones, but the humanoid 
bald ones.  But not the spiky-hair bald ones.  The psychic bald ones.  You 
know who I mean.  And if you know who in the heck they are, please let me 
know.
        Anyway, she was dressed up just like on of them.  The costume was 
perfect.  The makeup was perfect.  It looked like she had just wandered down 
from space.  This wasn't your 'buy a costume in a package' affair.  This had 
taken time, money, dedication, and a high level of artistic skill.  I was, 
and still am, impressed.
        The second thing we saw was Claudia Christian, from Babylon 5, 
signing autographs.  Warnings about the pain imposed if you cut in line were 
floating about.  I stayed away.  I wouldn't know what to do with an autograph 
if I had one.  Keep it as a bookmark, I guess.
        The first celebrity I ever saw was in El Paso, in a Walmart.  I was 
wandering around the shampoo section, and a really scruffy man, smelling a 
bit, wandered by.  He stooped and began examining hair care products.  In a 
flash I realized who it was.  Tommy Chong.  My suspicions were confirmed 
when I heard later on the news that Cheech and Chong were in town for a low 
rider competition.
        Having seen such and impressive person as Tommy Chong in the flesh, 
I was not impressed with Claudia Christian.  No body odor.  No scratching of 
parts that shouldn't be scratched in public.  Claudia was a let down.
        We eventually ended up in the dealer's room.  Lots of stuff for sell.  
More Star Trek trading cards than I had ever seen.  Not that I understand 
why anyone would buy them, but they were there.  Posters, figures, paste-on 
Klingon foreheads, little clickety-click Star Trek badges; just about 
anything you can imagine.  Crystal Wood, a local author, was selling her 
book, Cut Him Out in Little Stars at a table as well.
        Eventually I realized that there was going to be a conference 
entitled "Vast Possibilities of the Future," with mucho big names in it.  
But, do to a mix up, I ended up in a room with Judith Ward.
        Ms. Ward is what you might call a professional fan.  From what I can 
tell she lives at conventions and breathes science fiction instead of air.  
Some people might call her obsessive.  I'll just call her dedicated, which 
indeed she is.
        Somehow she helped to get the 1997 WorldCon (World Science Fiction 
Convention) to be help in San Antonio.  The WorldCon is one of the biggest 
conventions in the universe, and she talked an hour about it.  I had no idea 
how much was involved in one of those things.  Thousands of people gathered 
from all around the world for five days.  Around three official hotels taking 
part.  It should be quite a sight.
        Regretfully, I had to get back home after that.  It certainly wasn't 
fifteen dollars, but it would have if I had been on schedule and got to do 
everything I had wanted to.  But those two hours wandering around lost were 
kind of fun.
        Early in November there is a Star Trek Convention being held close 
by.  Just Star Trek though.  Hmm.  It may be interesting - even with no space 
experts.
        And then there is WorldCon in 1997.  That should be a blast.  The 
second Star Wars trilogy should be out about then, if Lucas keeps his 
promise.  Hmm.  I'll have to think about it.
        Oh, and there were no waterlogged Klingons.  Sunday was nice and 
clear.

ANSICHEK Version 7.0
DOS Freeware Program
Patrick Harvey
Email to : MRGALAXY@AOL.COM

One of the worse things that could possible happen during the holiday's is to 
have your computer trashed by a computer virus or related program.  We have 
all heard the gospel: Backup your data and scan for viruses.  While I scan 
my hard drive and floppies regularly, I must admit that I do not back up my 
files as often as I should.  However, there are many other dangers that we 
should check for on our computer.  

One form of vicious attack on your computer system could be in the form of an 
ANSI bomb. I had heard about ANSI bombs, but had never really had a good 
understanding of how an ANSI file could harm my computer.  After I downloaded 
the file ANSICHK7.ZIP I got an education as well as peace of mind.  

As explained in the documentation file, what the program ANSICHEK is designed 
to do is scan files for hidden and possible dangerous ANSI codes that could 
remap your keyboard, and inform you of their existance.  If you were to look 
at or TYPE a file that had an ANSI code that remapped your keyboard, you 
would not know it until you pressed the key that was remapped.  An example is 
that your spacebar could be redefined to start a hard disk format when 
pressed, and you wouldn't know until you pressed the spacebar and the damage 
has begun. 

An included program is BOMBVIEW.  This program will allow you to safely view 
any suspected files, without the threat of actually activating the keyboard 
re-definition.  If you are unsure whether what you are looking at is safe or 
not, ask and friend and play it safe.  Do not try view a file that ANSICHEK 
suspects may have a bomb with any other program than VIEWBOMB, or you could 
be in for a devastating surprise.

The best part is that this protection is free.  What better way to go into 
the holiday season then to get a useful program for free.  I highly encourage 
that you look for this freeware program and use it regularly along with your 
virus scanner.

The Beavis And Butt-head Experience
Geffen Records, Copyright 1993

Track Listing
1.  I Hate Myself And Want To Die by Nirvana
2.  Looking Down The Barrel Of A Gun by Anthrax
3.  Come to Butt-head by Beavis And Butt-head
4.  99 Ways To Die by Megadeth
5.  Bounce by Run DMC
6.  Deuces Are Wild by Aerosmith
7.  I Am Hell by White Zombie
8.  Poetry And Prose by Primus

10.  Search And Destroy by Red Hot Chili Peppers
11.  Mental *@%#! by Jackyl
12.  I Got You Babe by Cher with Beavis and Butt-head


     Obnoxious - Disgusting - Juvenile - Cool - Radical.  These
are all words that have been used to describe MTV's cartoon
series known as "Beavis and Butt-head."  All of those words are
quite accurate to describe their show on MTV, but none of them
apply to this Compact Disc.
     The manner that the CD is put together, it suggests that
this was one of the television shows.  However, without the
visual images that the tv series gives to the viewer, this CD
leaves the listener flat.
     Nirvana's recording of "I Hate Myself and Want To Die" is an
ironic addition considering the suicide of lead
guitarist/vocalist Kurt Cobain.  The song is badly recorded, and
Nirvana never sounded worse, but that's usually par for Nirvana's
usual material.
     The banter between three members of Anthrax and the
characters of Beavis and Butt-head is quite comical.  The song
"Looking Down The Barrel Of A Gun" is quite rancid.  It's
recorded in a style that reminds one of supposed Rap/Heavy Metal
artist (if you could call him that) Ice T.  Personally, I have
heard better from Anthrax.
     Track 3 introduces us to some of the usual banter of Beavis
and Butt-head.  "Come to Butt-head" is quite comical in places,
with Butt-head singing to a woman that he wants to "make it
with."  Beavis' comments in the background are so off-beat and
ridiculous that I found myself wondering where Mike Judge (the
guy behind the voices of Beavis and Butt-head) gets his ideas
from.
     Megadeth, one of the "supersonic" bands of the '90s,
performs a new song called "99 Ways To Die."  It follows the
tradition of good, solid, hard-driving metal from one of the best
lyrical bands in Metal today.  Being that is produced by Max
Norman (one of the best Hard Rock/Metal producers in the
business), it's obviously one of the best tracks on this Compact
Disc.
     Track 5 brings us to one of the most useless bands to "cross
over" to the Rock and Roll arena from the Rap scene.  Run DMC had
a big hit with their version of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way." 
Believe me, "Bounce" won't duplicate that feat anytime soon.
     Ironically, Aerosmith follow Run DMC with their big hit
"Deuces Are Wild."  Not so ironically, this is much better than
the limp Run DMC song.  If you ever get a chance to check out the
video for this song, don't miss it.
     Tracks 7, 8, 9, and 10 introduce us to some more of the
REALLY bad songs on this Compact Disc.  White Zombie and Primus
give us some of the more inane levels of Heavy Metal.  Neither
band is a really good representative of what Metal is all about. 
Sir Mix-a-Lot gives us yet another of the lame rappers on the
scene.  I have no idea why this was included on this Compact
Disc.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers show us just how stupid people
in Los Angeles can really be when it comes to music.  After all,
who would name himself "Flea" and play music in his underwear? 
That's right, an idiot.
     Track 11 leads us to the most promising rising star in the
Hard Rock scene today.  Jackyl are starting to score big on the
airwaves with a straight forward attitude that is reminiscent of
early AC/DC.  Don't miss this band when they play live...they
will knock your socks right off your feet.  This particular song,
"Mental *@%#!" is not one of the better tracks I have ever heard
from them, but it is infinitely better than the previous four
tracks.
     Track 12 brings us to the song that got more airplay than
all the others.  Whether it has to do with Cher's star quality or
the "cutesy" video that was done for the song, this song sucks. 
I like Cher, but I think she made a big mistake recording this
song for this Compact Disc.
     In my final analysis of this Compact Disc, don't bother
buying it.  Instead, borrow it from your little brother and
record tracks 3 (Come To Butt-head), 4 (99 Ways To Die), 6
(Deuces Are Wild), and 11 (Mental *@%#!).  That way, you will get
your money's worth from the Compact Disc.

Overall Grade:  F

A Christmas Album by Amy Grant
Reunion Records, Copyright 1983

Track Listing
1.  Tennessee Christmas
2.  Hark!  The Herald Angels Sing
3.  Preiset Dem Konig!  (Praise The King!)
4.  Emmanuel
5.  Little Town
6.  Christmas Hymn
7.  Love Has Come
8.  Sleigh Ride
9.  The Christmas Song (Chestnuts)
10.  Heirlooms
11.  A Mighty Fortress/Angels We Have Heard On High


"Of all the memories that come to mind of Christmases past, I
think my favorites include chilly wind...coats and one
glove...red noses and warm, wooly hats...the smell of freshly cut
pine and of aged wood burning in the fireplace...being out of
school...singing favorite hymns...decorating the tree with apples
and ribbons and long treasured ornaments...being with
family...seeing old friends...time to talk...time to
listen...wrapping surprises...all of the children...lots of
cooking...even more laughter...and always the music.  This
collection of songs - some old and some new - is an attempt to
capture and share a part of our Christmas with you.  Most of all,
this is a celebration for all time because God loved us enough to
send us His Son.  Merry Christmas always!"  --Amy Grant (1)


     Christmas albums very rarely include an original tune mixed
in with the "old favorites."  This album seems to be an ultra-
rarity with three original lyrical songs and one instrumental
sprinkled in.  This is actually one of the most uplifting,
spiritual, and positive Christmas albums that I have ever heard.
     Miss Grant starts us off with an original entitled
"Tennessee Christmas" which she co-wrote and performs with her
husband Gary Chapman.  With it's roots partially in the Light
Rock sound, and Country music, this song takes you back to the
family reunions we have all endured and enjoyed through the
years.  One of the best songs I have ever heard from Miss Grant.
     We move from an original to an old favorite of many people. 
"Hark!  The Herald Angels Sing" is one of those songs that most
people know right off the cuff.  Miss Grant injects some real
enthusiasm into with a slight change to the background music, but
nothing that really changes the song in anyone's memory.
     Track 3 drops us into the most delightful piece on this CD. 
"Preiset Dem Konig (Praise The King)" is composed by Shane
Keister and is truly a piece fitting for a member of royalty.
     Track 4 is one of the most recognizable of Amy's concert
songs.  "Emmanuel" is jumpy, catchy, and a lot of damn good fun. 
While I do not subscribe to Amy's brand of religion, she performs
some real magick with this piece.  The ending of the track is
blended perfectly with the beginning of "Little Town" so as to
make the two songs seem to be one.  This is definitely an updated
song in a musical sense, but again it doesn't change the way
anyone will remember the song.  The ending is orchestrated
magnificently around Amy's voice.
     The next two tracks, "Christmas Hymn" and "Love Has Come"
are originals written by Amy Grant and infamous Christian-rock
artist Michael W. Smith.  These are the two most powerful pieces
on the album, truly showcasing Amy and Michael's talent of
songwriting together.
     "Sleigh Ride" is another of the classic songs on the CD, and
the only one that Miss Grant really ruins with her enthusiasm. 
The song is performed greatly, but Miss Grant's off-side comments
of "Come on you guys" really grate under my skin.  If it were not
for those comments in the background of the song, I would have
really found myself enjoying it a lot more.
     "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts)" is one of those songs that
always got under my skin at Christmas time.  However, Amy takes
this song and transforms it into a great ball of fun.  With her
energy pouring through her performance, you can't help but smile
like a little kid looking at presents on Christmas morning.
     Another original, "Heirlooms" is one of Amy's "conviction"
songs.  She tries very hard to remind people that Christmas is
about the birth of Jesus ben Joseph (in the Christian tradition)
with this very touching song.  In her comparison of old photos
and memories with her faith in Jesus, she takes a very well
intentioned stab at the commercialization of the seasons and
rituals that permeate our lives throughout the cycle of the year.
     "A Mighty Fortress/Angels We Have Heard On High" closes out
this set of songs.  In it's own masterful manner, it's quite a
fitting closing to this very memorable piece of work that Amy
Grant-Chapman has put together for her fans.

     "I have long considered the creative impulse to be a visit -
a thing of grace, perhaps, not commanded or owned so much as
awaited, prepared for.  A thing, also, of mystery.  This
recording endeavors to explore some of that mystery.
     "It looks as well into the earlier eastern influences of the
Celts, the likelihood that they started from as far away as
Eastern Europe before being driven to the western margins of
Europe in the British Isles.  With their musical influences came
rituals around birth and death which treated the land as holy and
haunted; this life itself as a visit.  Afterwards, one's soul
might move to another plane, or another form - perhaps a tree. 
The Celts knew then, as we are re-learning now, a deep respect
for all the life around them.  This recording aspires to be
nothing so much as a reflection into the weave of these things."

     Loreena McKennitt is a poet's musical dream.  From what I
can tell, a third of the lyrical material on her discs comes from
the works of such established poets as William Blake and Alfred
Lord Tennyson.  Her soft, personal approach to the musical
content underscores the power behind the words of these poetic
"giants."  But this, by no means, over-shadows Miss McKennitt's
ability to write stirring lyrics of her own.  The lyrics of "The
Old Ways" stand as a proud testament of this fact.
     As with "Parallel Dreams' (reviewed in an earlier STTS
Volume), "The Visit" brings the listener into another world. 
This disc is a definite "must-have."

Hit records are easy to make.  A catchy beat, some catchy lyrics,
and a record company to promote the single is all that is really
needed.  While the single is quite good, the rest of the album is
usually just barely palatable.  Very few bands have albums that
provide the promise of the first single.  Ace of Bass is one of
those bands.

Hailing from Sweden, the band instantly reminds of you the 70s
power-pop group Abba.  The lineup consists of two guys and two
girls, none of which play any instruments.  And very much like
Abba, their initial success here in the United States has been
very big.  Their first single, The Sign, recieved heavy airplay
on Pop airwaves, while it's accompanying video got very heavy
rotation on Music TeleVision (MTV).  What this single promised,
the rest of the album delivers.

From the onset, this album is filled with great lyrics backed by
a good beat and wonderful synthetic music, which is this band's
only drawback.  One falls instantly in love with tracks such as
"The Sign," "All That She Wants," "Don't Turn Around," and the
extremely catchy "Happy Nation."  The lyrics have some deep
meaning too.  For instance, from the title track:

"no one's gonna drag you up
 to get into the light where you belong
 but where do you belong"


There is only fear for a band like this.  With this being their
first album, I hope that they don't let success spoil them.  Too
many bands have had great first albums, only to be destroyed by
public apathy for the successive albums after it (Ratt
immediately comes to mind).  Let's hope this band will be around
for some time to come.

Abba-esque By Erasure

2.  S.O.S.
3.  Take A Chance On Me (*)
4.  Voulez Vous

Many bands today owe their influence directly to bands that were
"superstars" in the past.  Obviously, for the two members of
Erasure, Abba is one of their greatest influences.  Why else
would they make a 4-song EP of Abba covers?  I haven't the
foggiest, but one thing is for sure...it didn't work very well.

These songs were brought from the "folk-pop" stylings that they
started with, into an era and age of "synthetic" music.  If you
took Abba, gave it a dance beat, sampled all the music into a
keyboard (that's right...ALL the music...EVEN the drums!), you
would get this EP.  To say that it outright stinks is a serious
understatement.

My advice to the reader is this:  If you are a fan of Depeche
Mode or Erasure, this is the CD for you.  If you are a fan of
Abba AND are weak of heart...avoid this disc like the plague!!!
There are some very fine discs of bands doing "covers" of another
band's songs, but this is definitely NOT one the better ones.

          To put it succinctly, STAR TREK:  GENERATIONS is more of a
     fan's movie than anything else, perhaps even more of a fan movie
     than any other picture in the franchise.  Folks walking in cold
     to a screening won't get much out of the secondary character
     interactions if they haven't watched ST:  NEXT GENERATION a few
     times over the past seven years.  Elements like Data's "emotion
     chip" and Spot, his cat; Geordi's visor and his friendship with
     Data; Riker's relationship with Picard and his dislike for a
     captaincy that would take him away from the Enterprise; and the
     technobabble ("warp core breach," "level 12 shock wave") that has
     become a hallmark of the series -- most of these elements will be
     so much clutter to the casual viewer.  As a result, non-fans are
     left with the villain -- Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), a nasty
     piece of work who never reaches his full potential -- and a plot
     that's as silly and abstract (if not existential) as the
     ludicrous "anti-time" concept that ended the TV series' regular
     run.
     
          The real attraction of GENERATIONS doesn't occur until deep
     into the third act:  the melding of the old guard with the new
     guard.  I got that familiar Trekkie lump in my throat when I
     first saw Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Captain
     Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) meet up on horseback in the
     movie's coming attractions trailer when it hit theaters in late
     summer.  "I take it the odds are against us and the situation's
     grim," Kirk says when Picard makes one last plea for the two
     captains to team up against a common enemy.  "Sounds like fun!"
     is the capper line that's perfectly in keeping with Captain
     Kirk's maverick nature while providing a nostalgic thrill for
     old-time fans.
     
          McDowell's Dr.  Soran is the threat that takes two Captains
     to stop: he's a mad scientist in the traditional mold, blowing up
     solar systems literally for his own enjoyment.  Strange as it
     sounds, the stellar explosions are engineered to influence the
     path of a ribbon of time called The Nexus.  As Guinan (Whoopi
     Goldberg), NEXT GENERATION's resident barkeep and in-house
     mysterious presence, explains it to Picard, The Nexus is a place
     of pure joy, and an intersection between all times and places.
     It's through The Nexus that the past and present Enterprise
     captains meet.  Having experienced the pure joy of The Nexus
     once, Soran's need to return to it exhibits all the characteris-
     tics of addiction.  You might say STAR TREK itself, whether in
     TV, movie, or print form, is The Nexus to which every Trekkie
     needs to return -- a place of pure joy that few others under-
     stand.
     
          The contrast between the two Captains isn't developed as
     much as I had hoped; it's mostly reduced to success in punch-outs
     with Soran (surprise, surprise, Kirk is the abler pugilist) and
     an extended discussion of duty.  The secondary characters are
     used mostly to just drive the plot along.  As is usual in the
     male-dominated STAR TREK world, the female characters have been
     given the least amount to do.  Two members of the original Trek
     cast, Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekhov (Walter Koenig), come
     along as window dressing for the first ten minutes (Leonard Nimoy
     and DeForest Kelley, the only other members asked back, de-
     clined), and most of the NEXT GENERATION cast have just a few
     lines, aside from the Data/emotion chip subplot, before they're
     cast aside for the juicy Soran/Klingon and Soran/Picard scenes.
     
          So, what does it take to translate NEXT GENERATION to the
     big screen?  Superficially, it takes retooled sets and graphics
     (to compensate for film's increased visual resolution), a
     lighting design that, at least aboard ship, seems much darker
     than it needs to be (the director of photography definitely
     decided to play with the dynamic range that film offers), a new
     Enterprise set (stellar cartography, well-conceived and
     executed), and the trashing of a starship that's become a ritual
     with the movies.  Plotwise, it didn't take all that much to
     launch a new series of movies.
     
          STAR TREK:  GENERATIONS will have made over 50 million bucks
     by the time you read these words, making it the most successful
     debut of an ST movie, ever.  Whether the fans can carry it beyond
     the first film's take (the most successful in the series) remains
     to be seen.  But how did I like it?
     
          Just fine, thank you.  Personally, I'd place it behind THE
     VOYAGE HOME (ST IV) and THE WRATH OF KHAN (ST II) in terms of
     entertainment value.

          Nothing seems more natural this fall movie season than for
     Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, one of the most romantic
     couples in Hollywood, to remake one of Hollywood's most romantic
     stories, LOVE AFFAIR.  The 1957 remake of the 1939 classic was
     titled AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, starring Cary Grant and Deborah
     Kerr, which formed the nostalgic nougat center of 1993's unex-
     pected romantic hit, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Framed by "the town
     that never sleeps," New York City, the story's romantic climax
     involves a fateful rendezvous on the Empire State Building and
     the heart-rending aftermath.  Movie buffs familiar with LOVE
     AFFAIR's turn of events may find nothing new in this latest
     version, but for a new generation of movie-goers this film is a
     wonderful introduction to some good, old-fashioned romance, an
     element sorely lacking in many of today's love stories.
     
          Beatty manages to poke some fun at his past as a glamorous
     playboy, giving his character, Mark Gambril, just the right heft
     as -- guess what -- a celebrity playboy.  How apropos for Beatty
     to choose this material, metaphorically presenting his newly-
     domesticated image as Bening's husband and father of two children
     through Gambril, a testosterone-driven sportscaster who goes
     through women as rapidly and as insensitively as the young
     Beatty.  Gambril is domesticating himself by becoming engaged to
     a powerful TV producer (Kate Capshaw), but for all the wrong
     reasons.  He's getting married to clean up his act; because it's
     the *right* thing to do; because he's convinced himself that he's
     in love.  That is, until he meets Terry McKay (Bening) on a
     flight to Sydney, Australia.
     
          Terry's situation roughly parallels Mike Gambril's, sans the
     sowing-wild-oats past.  Engaged to a powerful business tycoon
     (Pierce Brosnan), Terry is unsure of herself and unsure of her
     love.  Musician by avocation and vocation, she helps make ends
     meet by decorating her fiancee's various homes and offices around
     the world.  She's little more than a decoration herself, or so
     the screenplay implies, which nicely serves as a metaphor for her
     image with the shallower movie-goers who can't think of her as
     anyone else but Beatty's wife.  Bening's talent and solid film
     resum‚ should be enough to dispel these perceptions, but it's
     hard to overcome the baggage that the name Warren Beatty still
     carries in the collective hive-mind of the audience.  These
     assumptions, as undeserved as they are, are belied by the skills
     of these talented actors, who also just happen to be two of the
     most charismatic screen presences working in film today.  Their
     flair, charisma, and off-screen relationship inform LOVE AFFAIR
     with a passion and affection that surpasses the sometimes-shallow
     screenplay.
     
          The script, by Robert Towne and Beatty, seems to be missing
     chunks of narrative, especially after Terry and Mike arrive back
     in New York, committed to meet three months later on the Empire
     State Building if their love is still true.  Those three months
     fly by, the scenes mostly filled with the lovers separately
     reprioritizing their lives and taking on new careers.  They
     become nurturers (he -- a football coach; she -- a music
     teacher), an obvious but appropriate metaphor for the nurturing
     nature that each one has awakened in the other.  What's missing,
     though, are the "break-up" scenes with their respective
     intendeds.  Assumed though these scenes are, actually presenting
     them would have given us further insight as to how profoundly the
     protagonists have affected each other.  Instead, we are left with
     lingering glances, lush music (courtesy of the never-boring Ennio
     Morricone), and Katherine Hepburn's "insightful" comparison of
     Beatty to an ugly duckling that doesn't know it's a swan.
     Hepburn plays Mike Gambril's aunt, a feisty 86-year-old woman who
     lives on a small Pacific island, dispensing bumper sticker wisdom
     between servings of tea and cake.  It's a disappointingly-
     scripted role for Hepburn's return to the screen after a 14 year
     absence, but once again, the actor is able to inform the role
     with warmth, humanity, and a sagacity beyond the words.
     
          While LOVE AFFAIR is a mixed bag, at best, Beatty and Bening
     have rarely been as rapturous as they are here.

          An intricate, literate, and fresh approach to hard-boiled
     movies.  Tarantino surpasses his first triumph as a writer/
     director, RESERVOIR DOGS, with a film that ties three stories
     together in a Gordian knot of plot and character.  A young couple
     robbing a restaurant frames the action, which features a couple
     of mob boys (Travolta & Jackson) out on an errand, a night out
     for Travolta and the mob boss' wife (Uma Thurman), and a
     down-on-his-luck boxer (Willis) who decides to go for the gold.
     Tarantino's dialogue sizzles and his direction cuts straight to
     the bone.  PULP FICTION deservedly won the Cannes Palm D'Or, and
     is going to be a nightmare for Tarantino to follow up.

          Ed Wood as directed by Ed Wood!  Tim Burton's paean to the
     man voted "Worst Film Director of All Time" (GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN
     9 FROM OUTER SPACE) looks amazingly like one of Wood's movies in
     atmosphere and subject matter, although it's miles better than
     anything Wood himself churned out.  Though the screenplay relies
     too much on the already-known and the assumed-to-be-true, Burton
     captures the director's enthusiasm for the sheer art of film-
     mmaking even though the man had no idea what he was doing.  Depp
     is astounding as Wood, a kinetic force of nature who seems to zip
     from scene to scene, eternally cheerful and eerily optimistic
     about his work.  Even more amazing is Martin Landau as the
     elderly Bela Lugosi, a portrayal that could have easily fallen
     into parody.  Look for an Oscar nomination in the supporting
     actor category.

          Movies that "blow up real good" seem to be the rage this
     year.  The publicity for THE SPECIALIST promised the love scenes
     between Stallone and Stone would be just as explosive as the
     special effects, but they're about as hot as a Fourth of July
     sparkler.  Stallone is a mercenary-for-hire, and Stone gives him
     a doozy of a job: take out the mobsters who killed her family
     when she was a little girl.  Rod Steiger and Eric Roberts are the
     father and son Colombian stereotypes who serve as Stone's
     targets, with scene-stealer James Woods acting as the family's
     bodyguard and security chief.  While the film hasn't bombed at
     the box office, it certainly bombs on most other levels.

          Marisa Tomei pursues the man who seems to be her dream beau
     (Robert Downey, Jr.) all the way to Italy, only to find out . . .
     well, that would be telling.  The land of amore comes vibrantly
     alive in director Norman Jewison's romantic follow-up to MOON-
     STRUCK, although the present film seems to lack the richness of
     the previous love story.  Tomei and Downey are just right in
     their roles, the music and cinematography set the mood perfectly,
     yet there seems to be a mechanical feeling to the plot twists and
     character manipulations.  Perhaps a little less cleverness and a
     little more romance would have served the movie well.  And it's a

          If the idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming pregnant
     induces shivers in you, then avoid JUNIOR at all costs.  If,
     however, a gentle comedy about understanding between the sexes
     appeals to you, then this reuniting of TWINS director, Ivan
     Reitman, and co-stars Schwarzenegger and DeVito is the movie for
     you.  Never tacky or tasteless, JUNIOR handles male pregnancy
     seriously, for a comedy, and offers another interpretation of
     procreation.  Emma Thompson is on-hand as Ahnold's love interest,
     playing the part of a klutzy scientist with great knockabout
     fervor that helps keep the picture moving through its draggy
     portions, of which there are too many.

          Tim Allen's Santa could use some Nome Improvement -- the
     script is littered with fat jokes and other "comedic" misfirings,
     making THE SANTA CLAUSE one of the most mean-spirited Christmas
     flicks of recent history (even considering the gosh-awful SILENT
     NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT series).  Allen becomes Santa by donning the
     jolly old elf's red suit after St. Nick accidentally falls from

     unacceptable for the under-five set.

          Loosely adapted from SWAN LAKE, this movie resulted from the
     efforts of a nest of former Disney animators, and the influence
     of that larger studio shows.  The animation is smooth, if bland
     and lacking in depth, and the character design is well thought-
     out and delineated.  The music that surrounds the story of a
     princess enchanted to live her days as a swan is the standout
     element, ranging from Broadway-esque show tunes to jazz pop to an
     old-time Hollywood musical number.  The youngest kids will get a
     kick out of a turtle named Speed and a decidedly-French frog,
     Jean-Bob, voiced by former Monty Pythoner John Cleese.

Druids by Morgan Llywelyn
Ivy Books, Copyright 1991, 1st Printing January 1993
ISBN 0-8041-0844-7, 400 Pages
LCCN 90-44292

     Reading books is a fundamental passion with me.  From
escapist SF/F novels to enlightening historical accounts, I
devour their pages like a small child cruising through Halloween
candy.  While I am open to reading novels from all authors, I
find myself gravitating to certain ones because of previous
novels I have read.  One of these is Mercedes Lackey, who has
written many novels that rank in my top twenty list.  I had never
heard of Morgan Llywelyn before, but was drawn towards her novel
"Druids" through an interest in the ancient Gauls.  What I
discovered was a novel that ranks as one of the most precious
"gems" in my book collection.
     From the opening chapter to the closing sentence, I was
absolutely captivated by this story-line.  I found myself reading
slower than usual, savoring each page's turn in the plot.  It was
almost as if my subconscious mind refused to race through the
events unfolding before my imagination.  Miss Llywelyn wrote this
story so well, I almost felt as if I was a member of the Gaulish
tribes.
     An even bigger surprise for me were the "lessons on life"
that are tucked away in the story.  I have a small book that I
have filled with quotations that mean something to me.  I found
myself adding quotations from this book to my list.  One of these
quotations is this:  "When you get to appreciate someone, the
dwelling that contains them becomes unimportant; you go to see
your friends, not the lodges they live in."  It is quotations
like this that will be passed on to my son Corey when he gets
older.
     If you enjoy SF/F novels, this is one book that your
personal library is screaming out for you to get.  I am sure that
you will come to treasure it just as much as I have.  Just
remember -- this is a story to savor.

                         Blessed Be!

Our Game:  An American Baseball History by Charles G. Alexander
Henry Holt Books, Copyright 1991, 1st Printing 1991
ISBN 0-8050-1594-9, 388 Pages
LCCN 90-20585

     There are parts of my childhood that I always cherish.  My
senior prom night, the thrill associated with my first dog, and
playing catch in the backyard with my father.  Of all the above
memories, the last one seems to be universal among young men. 
It's this universal love for baseball that has found it's way
into the ideals of father/son bonding.  It was my father that
taught me how to catch a fly ball.  It was my father that showed
me how to twist my wrist in just such a manner to achieve the
elusive pitch called "the curveball."  It was my father that came
to every single Little League game that I played in.  It was my
father that cheered the loudest when I got a single.  Where
baseball was concerned, it was my father that showed me
everything.  Those are memories that will last a lifetime.
     Charles Alexander accomplishes a similar feeling with this
book.  He tries valiantly to chronicle the history of baseball
from it's earliest days to the final days of the 1990 season. 
With so much information to present in one format, this book will
lose the average reader quite easily.  For someone like me, an
avid baseball nut, this book will present some of the most
cherished memories of the game's history.
     For what Mr. Alexander attempted to do, this book falls just
short of pure genius, but there are some flaws to it.  Instead of
dividing periods of baseball into eras, each of Mr. Alexander's
chapters chronicle a ten-year period.  In this manner, certain
events are not given enough light in this history while others
are a bit over-done.  For instance, the 1919 Chicago "Black" Sox
scandal in the World Series never got much mention in the chapter
concerning the period from 1910-1919.  However, in the section
concerning the period 1920-1929, it took virtually most of center
stage, thereby casting a pall over the early years of Babe Ruth's
career and the "prime" years of Ty Cobb's.
     In short, this is quite a good history.  It's compact, but
it does not "gloss" over most of the issues.  For someone
interested in a crash-course on the history of baseball, this is
the book for them.  For those already well versed in the history
of baseball, this is a good book to recommend to your fifteen
year old when trying to explain the current strike.  After all,
the reasoning behind this strike goes way back through all of
baseball's rich history.

Pegasus In Flight By Anne McCaffery
Del Rey Books    Copyright 1990
ISBN 0-345-36897-5     LCCN 90-92901
First Hardcover Edition:  December 1990

Have you ever read a book that has totally confused you, but has
had a story-line that is fascinating beyond belief?  If you
haven't read such a novel, this is the book for you.  Anne
McCaffery has FINALLY written a novel that has left me without a
clue as to where it was going and what meaning it had.

To be honest, this novel is not that bad.  However, it reads like
a second or third part of a series.  There are subplots in this
book that are ASSUMED that the reader knows what is going on. 
When you pick this book up, you feel as if you have wandered into
the middle of a conversation on quantum physics.  That's right,
you will get the feeling of being TOTALLY lost!  This book is not
marked on the cover OR the inside jacket as being part of a
series, which makes Miss McCaffery's writing style even more of a
mystery.

The plot of the story follows an enclave of "Talented" (folks
with paranormal kinetic abilities) located in a large metropolis
on Earth.  They are basically the work-horses of the society,
since they can do things that other humans can't.  In short, they
are indentured servants.  From this point, the story delves into
three tracks that all become intermingled and absolutely
confusing to keep track of.  The first plot-line deals with a
young lady with kinetic abilities who is hiding from the
"Talented" folk because of her fear of them.  The second
plot-line follows a young boy who is being trained in his kinetic
abilities.  Predictably, both of those characters have kinetic
abilities that go WAY beyond the scale of any of the other
kinetics.  The third plot-line deals with a space platform that
is being built in Earth's orbit.  The contractor of this platform
is the villianess of the story.  Predictably, she is shady and
very unsympathetic to the plight of the kinetics.

What Miss McCaffery has succeeded in doing one thing with this
novel.  She has totalled destroyed my faith in her abilities to
write good, focused stories along the lines of "The Lady" or "The
Dragonriders Of Pern" series.  This novel is a fine example of
what happens when a good writer doesn't think his/her plot line
completely through.  It would be best to avoid this book at all
costs, unless you are a McCaffery fan and you MUST have ALL of
her novels in your collection.

The Adept Book Two:  The Lodge Of The Lynx by Katherine Kurtz &
Deborah Turner Harris
Ace Books, Copyright 1992, 1st Printing June 1992
ISBN 0-441-00344-3


Most people dread sequels.  They usually complain about how drawn
out the story has become and the number of contradictions in the
main character(s) that are created with a second storyline.  I,
however, am drawn to sequels.  Especially sequels to books that I
like.  I savor the possibility of seeing a side of the main
character(s) that I had not envisioned before, the chance that
the author has to redefine what the character really means.  When
I picked up this novel, I felt that same exhilaration.  Boy, was
I disappointed.

While Miss Kurtz and Miss Harris have once again turned out a
fine story, their perception of the characters of Sir Adam
Sinclair, Mr. Peregrine Lovat and Chief Detective Noel McLeod
have become even more clouded to me.  While their perception of
Sir Adam Sinclair has basically remained unchanged (other than
the fact that we get to see him finally fall in love), the
characters of Lovat and McLeod are so estranged from the original
novel that one gets lost trying to keep up with the changes. 
It's not that I am against changes in the characters, after all
everyone goes through changes in their lives.  But not at the
speed that the lives of these two characters change.

Another big disappointment to this novel was an EXTREMELY
ridiculous ending.  I am quite sure that the Freemasons in
Scotland have a good foothold in the society there, but not to
the level that this book suggests.  For those that prefer a touch
of reality to SF/F novels, the ending to this will leave them
real damn cold.

There are good points to the novel though.  At one point, there
is a suggestion as to what might truly cause personality
disorders, with an emphasis on past lives.  While the theory is
never truly expanding on, it sounds quite plausible.  Another
point is the ability to watch Mr. Lovat slowly lose his cloak of
insecurity, while his confidence in his abilities starts to grow. 
There are very novels that deal with such inner workings in a
character.

While I recommend this book, it is with extreme caution to the
reader.  Abandon your sense of what is real, for detachment is
very needed to finish this novel without truly hating it.  Don't
forget to abandon everything you think you know about
Freemasonry, because this book plays up it's "secret society" to
levels that are almost too insane to believe.

The Lady by Anne McCaffery
Ballantine Books, Copyright 1987
LCCN 86-92092
ISBN 0-345-35674-8
Pages:  369

When you mention the name Anne McCaffery, most people immediately
think of her Dragonriders of Pern series.  The setting for that
series and most of her other novels is in the Science Fiction
and/or Fantasy realm.  I was genuinely shocked and pleased to
find a novel by her that didn't fall into either of the above
categories.

"The Lady" is set in modern day Ireland, centering around an
estate and stable in the countryside between the towns of
Kilcoole and Greystones.  The family is a very odd one, in that
husband and daughter are very close, while the mother falls in
the range of a "snooty aristocrat."  The "battle" falls between
the mother and the father over what the daughter should be
allowed to do.  The daughter wishes to ride horses, while the
mother wishes for her to become a "proper lady" in the fashion of
aristocracy.  Soon enough, Selina Healey enters the lives of this
family and things get turned upside down.

Miss McCaffery has written what is, in my mind, one of the best
pieces of work she has produced.  The storyline is believeable
right down to it's very core.  The family's struggles, both
internal and external, are written from every point of view.  But
Miss McCaffery focuses on the young daughter through the entire
novel, letting the reader grow with her.  It is this that makes
the strongest point of the entire story-line.  You find yourself
totally encompassed in the daughter's life, living every
experience with her, seeing the world through new eyes.

I love to read books that express the relationship of human
beings with one another.  "The Lady" is one of the best examples
of such relationships that I have read in quite a while.  I
highly recommend this book to people that are looking for a
change of pace from SciFi thrillers, Suspense Thrillers, and the
such.  Pick it up and give it a read.

                                  THE TINKERBELLS


         "He didn't even read the letter."
         Peter's anger and adolescence caused his voice to rise sharply and
      further aggravated him.  He flipped the two dice lying on the Samsonite
      folding table and caused them to spin out to sixes.  Boxcars, he
      growled inwardly, his hands still fiercely clenched in his pockets.
      Unsatisfied, he resumed his angry pacing.  Tossing dice, even using
      only his mind, hardly eased his fury.
         Across the room, comfortably reclined in his favorite chair, Walter
      Morrison watched his young friend pace and toss the dice on the table.
      A knock on the door stopped the tossing, but did nothing for the
      pacing.  Peter twisted the door knob, from across the room, and watched
      while Olivia's long blonde hair signaled her arrival.
         The slender young woman held the door for Jimmy, the fourth and last
      member of the Friday gathering.  The familiar whirr of Jimmy's wheel
      chair preceded him into the apartment.  He flipped the joy stick
      control and motored to his customary place at the table.
         "Evenin' everyone."  Jimmy and Olivia spoke together.  When they
      were in the same room, or hooked in their unique tandem, they spoke as
      one.  Their super sensitive minds seemed hooked together, as surely as
      if a thick, black cable were connected to each young head.  Their
      thoughts might start separately somewhere in the swirling mass of one
      brain or the other, but what came out was a duet.
         Walter pushed up from his chair and moved the four steps to his
      place at the plastic topped table.  His pack of Kools followed,,a step
      behind, and nestled alongside his arm when he leaned onto the table.
      Everyone in the room knew Walter would have had to quit smoking, for
      lack of cigarettes and matches, if he didn't keep the green and white
      packages following him with some small piece of his ever active mind.
      The three younger members of the group often teased him about his
      absent-mindedness but were really expressing the affection they felt
      for their mentor and friend.
         Olivia tossed her windbreaker at the clothes tree standing in the
      corner and ignored the nylon fabric, as it moved on its own to rest on
      one of the brass arms.
         Peter relinquished his attempt at setting the indoor pacing record
      and took his seat at the small table.  The meeting was opened.
         A carbon copy of the letter causing Peter's outrage, and the focus
      of the meeting, was lying on the table.  Addressed to The President of
      The United States, the letter asked for an immediate reduction in
      nuclear weaponry and prompt elimination of current uses of
      radioactivity.  A thinly veiled threat of the group's intent to take
      matters into their own hands formed the final paragraph.
      
         Delivered in the daily flood of letters, cards and petitions, the
      letter had been placed in the stack marked Possible Threats and
      forwarded with the rest of the day's crank mail to the F.B.I.  The
      President had never been aware that anything signed with a drawing of
      Walt Disney's Tinkerbell had entered his world.  He was a very busy
      man.
      
         The two week deadline the group established passed without any
      change.  They were meeting to decide which way to move.
         "O.K., what do we do?" Olivia, speaking alone for a change, voiced
      the nagging question on everyone's mind.
         "Show them."  Peter's frustration exploded into the room, up turned
      in pitch as usual.
         "Three Mile Island?"  Jimmy and Olivia queried.
         A third vote for their alternate plan was registered with Peter's
      nod, making Walter the lone dissenter.
         "We are fixin' to put our tushes in a terrible bind."  Walter
      disliked being the devil's advocate, but felt obligated to express what
      could become their collective fate.  "There are a lot of bad guys out
      there.  They, and a lot of good guys wearing their red, white, and blue
      hats, will all want to give us a permanent room in one of their special
      resorts.  If we start playing with their nuclear toys, even the ones
      they wish they were rid of, they're going to get nasty, real fast.  We
      need a safe place.  Safer than this old apartment, anyway."
         "Dad's place in the mountains.  Quiet, remote, and those hillbillies
      hate people in black Fords."  Olivia raised her eyebrows, asking for a
      vote.
         Three heads nodded their agreement.  The plan was approved.
         "Go home, get your excuses made and your things together.  I'll gas
      the wagon and pick you up between seven and eight.  Bring what you need
      for a couple of weeks."  Walter played organizer, despite his lack of
      any sense of order.  The meeting ended.  The youngsters left the room
      subdued, but determined.
         Walter watched through the window as the three young people went
      their separate ways.  For all their mental powers, they still lacked
      the ability to see beyond their adolescent black and white view of the
      world.  They wanted the pristine purity of what should be, not the
      multi shaded reality of life.  While they had experimented with their
      combined mental powers, Walter prayed that they were not like gnats
      trying to eat an elephant.  The joint powers of the Soviet and American
      nations were an awesome meal, especially for three kids and one middle
      aged man.  Walter suppressed the images he was having of dungeons,
      chains fastened to blood stained walls, and husky, dark men with
      leather hoods and large whips.  He called his cigarettes, keys, and
      jacket and turned the lights out by hand.  He rolled his eyes toward
      the heavens, imploring divinity once again and locked the door.
      Tomorrow, he thought.  They'll get the word early tomorrow.
      
         No one saw the grey and brown haired man leave the brick apartment
      building.  If someone had noticed, they would not have given him a
      second thought.  Walter looked quite ordinary.
      
         Despite her sharply focused efforts, the First Lady of The United
      States could find no mention of Three Mile Island in her foot thick
      stack of morning newspapers.  She did not understand why, but when
      George wanted her to search the papers for something, she obeyed.  The
      strident ringing of the telephone, at five thirty, had set this search
      into motion.  She had only caught pieces of the Presidential end of the
      conversation.  Phrases drifted across the king sized bed and teased her
      mind.  She couldn't make any sense from the little she heard, but
      George's ramrod stiff back and the terseness of his replies told her
      that important events were taking shape.  Phrases, tantalizingly brief,
      followed her while she dressed.  Phrases like; absolutely clean...?
      Where was security?  The whole mess?
         None of it made any sense, but it tore the hell out of sleeping.
         George remained silent, as he paced the floor, his hands making
      little progress toward rearranging his pillow smashed hair.  She smiled
      gently at the familiar display of Presidential nakedness and waited for
      his mind to sort out his next actions.
         The change came suddenly when he snatched his glasses from the night
      stand and started stabbing numbers into the telephone.  She hurried to
      the small desk and retrieved a note pad and pen for his drumming
      fingers.  She turned her back and rushed to the bathroom to bring her
      husband his false teeth.  He definitely sounded more presidential with
      his teeth in place, that was important even at nearly six in the
      morning.
         The president, his skinny, naked buttocks clenching and relaxing as
      he waited for his sleeping Vice President to answer the ringing
      summons, was amused.  The world might explode, but he would damn well
      be properly adorned, if the First Lady had her way.  He shook his head
      and smiled with pleasure, as his wife of twenty five years hurried to
      win her self imposed race with the V.P.  Her next effort would be to
      get his skinny carcass hidden under some respectable clothing.
         The First Lady beat the V.P. by ten seconds and maintained decorum.
      She accepted the hastily scrawled note from her husband, followed its
      request, and began sifting through the morning editions for mention of
      Three Mile Island.  She thought the issue long dead, but perhaps
      something new had happened.
         The Vice President listened sleepily as the President detailed the
      incredible news.  Three Mile Island, expected to be deadly with
      contamination for centuries, was suddenly pristine and pure.  "In
      fact," the President relayed with amazement evident in his voice,
      "there isn't even the normal background radiation the technicians
      expect anywhere in the world."
         The two men agreed on who needed to know, and broke the connection.
      The Vice President would gather the forces of democracy and assemble
      them to tackle this newly risen Phoenix.  The only problem he faced was
      getting anyone to believe the story he himself was barely able to
      accept.
      
         Later that same morning, after his early morning meeting with a
      stern President and a silent Vice President, Matthew Simmes called his
      most reliable investigator and paced the floor while the younger man
      crossed Philadelphia from his separate office complex.  The two men
      were part of an elite branch of the National Security Agency.  Their
      activities were so classified that only their boss knew they existed.
      Their assignments were so sensitive they seldom met face-to-face.
         Today was obviously an exception, Robert Blanton thought, as he rode
      the elevator to his supervisor's eleventh floor office.
         "Have a drink, Bob," the lean figure behind the desk offered,
      looking up over the newest additions to the clutter of reports covering
      the desk top, extending a quart mason jar of murky water.
         Robert Blanton hesitated, he did not wish to insult his boss nor did
      he wish to taste any of the cloudy liquid.
         "What's in here?" he inquired, holding the jar up to the light
      streaming through the east facing window.
         "Water...  From the core container at Three Mile Island."
         "Jesus Christ!"  Robert lowered the jar to the cluttered desk
      instantly, flinching as some splashed out onto his hand.  He hesitated
      before wiping his hand on his pants leg, half expecting his fingers to
      turn black, or hurt, or something.  Nothing happened.  He looked
      questioningly at Matthew Simmes, who was grinning like a fourteen year
      old boy watching his first carnival girlie show.
         "That stuff's safer than mother's milk.  The lab boys say they can't
      detect any radiation, not even what's present in tap water.  Last
      night, someone neutralized all the radiation in that whole damn
      reactor, including the core.  The FBI, NRC and NSA are swarming around
      down there like flies on a fresh turd.  Nobody knows a damn thing, but
      they're busy trampling each other to find out what, or who, and most
      important...  How."
         Silence filled the room as both men mentally gnawed the bone before
      them.  One man was savoring the unlikely feast for the first time,
      while his dining partner and superior was struggling to grasp the
      subtleties of his second portion.  Neither man got much pleasure from
      their efforts.
         Both men were charged with surveillance of and security against
      those who would wreak nuclear havoc on the country.  They were not
      concerned with military weaponry except when it fell into the hands of
      paramilitary or civilian splinter groups who might use their new found
      power for extortion or punishment.  The missing radioactivity, however
      it vanished, was sufficiently powerful to constitute a weapon;
      therefore, the jar of water, a freshly calibrated Geiger counter, and a
      puzzle arrived a Matthew Simmes' home at seven thirty that morning.
      The two couriers had insisted he read the letter bearing the embossed
      Presidential Seal.
         The hand written missive urged his complete and speedy resolution of
      the mystery and made the usual references to national security and
      welfare.
         Matthew shared his suddenly tasteless morning coffee with his wife
      and shuddered occasionally, as permutations of what had occurred at
      Three Mile Island began to cross his mind.  Radiation, the silent,
      stealthy killer of the Atomic Age was containable, within limits.  The
      death dealing potential of the radiation contained within reactor
      number one was enormous, yesterday.  Today, the water, concrete, steel,
      and exotic metals inside that giant dome were inert, normal.  Actually
      less than normal, speaking radioactively.
         If the same person, persons, or power, decided to help themselves
      again...  Generators would stop, bombs would be mere pieces of junk,
      medical equipment would cease to function, and....  The list of
      civilian, military, and industrial uses of shattered atoms was too
      extensive to worry through, over one cup of coffee.
         Matthew's greatest concern was that the phenomenon was affecting
      only United States atoms.  Lets face facts, he told himself, the
      Soviets would hardly be willing to admit that one of their underground
      tests went click, much less that the radioactivity of the fissionable
      material had vanished like a stripper's G-string.  When it was gone, no
      one could recall seeing it leave.
         "Damn." Matthew swore aloud, the third venting of frustrations since
      he had finished the President's note.
         "Damn it."
      
         "Walter, your cigarettes."   Peter called from the couch.  Peter
      disliked cigarettes, but Walter's single vice was tolerable.
         Walter held his right hand up, snapped his fingers, and waited for
      the package of Kools to levitate and scamper to him.  The older man was
      beginning to think there was some truth to the idea the youngsters had,
      maybe he was really slipping.  He shook his head and walked down the
      hall of the cabin, to make certain Jimmy was resting comfortably.
         Jimmy could move a mountain, if the idea struck his fancy, but
      Walter feared the night's activities had strained even Jimmy's vast
      powers.  Walter was also concerned that all the moving around and
      hassle had done the delicate looking young man some unrevealed harm.
      Jimmy never complained, despite being a captive inside a body that
      resembled something made from the fire sale rejects from a mannequin
      factory.  His shriveled limbs were the result of drugs his mother had
      taken just before his conception.  Jimmy had never walked a step or
      lifted a fork, but his cerebral power had become evident very early in
      his life.  His mother had been watching when he caused his stuffed toy
      to move from the foot of his crib to a more comforting closeness next
      to his cheek.  His mother had maintained her exuberance until her
      husband returned from work.  Jimmy was awakened and summarily deprived
      of his plush puppy.  He unknowingly reassured his mother of her sanity
      and moved the puppy back to its proper place.  His dark eyes closed
      again and slumber claimed the miniature marvel.
         Those awesome powers grew and twenty years later were coupled with
      the strengths of his friends to deprive the officials of the nuclear
      agencies of one gigantic worry bead, while adding to Walter's list of
      concerns.  The radiation was changed but the concern was not.  The
      reactions from officialdom were slowly trickling into the papers, and
      the everyone seemed to want back what had been theirs.  They seemed to
      cherish worries.
         The group had just concluded their final draft of the letter they
      were mailing to the White House.  Jimmy had participated through Olivia
      and their amazing rapport, while he allowed the body he seldom felt to
      rest in bed.  The envelope bore the admonition that the writers were
      responsible for Three Mile Island.  Since no one at the White House
      could have remained uninformed of the most recent events at that ill
      fated piece of real estate, this letter was expected to reach The
      President.


             Dear Mr. President,
                You are, I am sure, aware of the recent events at
             Three Mile Island.  I am proud to be a participant in the
             nuclear cleanup that is sweeping our country.
                I am writing in the hope of enlisting your assistance
             in this enterprise.  You may signal your agreement by
             announcing, prior to 1800 hours, December twenty-fourth,
             that unilateral disarmament has begun.
                You will find enclosed a copy of the letter I have
             dispatched to the Soviets.  Neither country need worry
             about the other cheating.  I will be watching, along with
             many of my friends.
                I trust you will join me in celebrating the coming new
             year, without the threat of atomic weapons.
                All production, assembly and distribution of nuclear
             weapons must stop before December twenty-fifth.
                Merry Christmas to you and yours.

         The letter was signed with a drawing of Walt Disney's Tinkerbell.
      
         A thick snow storm blanketed Washington, D.C., as more than fifty
      people read the copies of the letter that were floating around 1600
      Pennsylvania Avenue.  Like the snow flakes turning the dirty grey of
      the city into virginal white, belying the reality below, smiles
      accompanied the circulating copies of the letter, but did little to
      mask the terror the letter evoked.
         Inside the oval shaped room housing a dressed and properly betoothed
      President and seven of his top advisors, there was no laughter.  The
      President had just asked the question that everyone had been skirting,
      like something freshly deposited by an errant dog.
         "How do we stop him, or them, from carrying out their threat?  If
      there was a threat."
         "Stop 'em hell.  Three Mile Island was locked up tighter than an old
      maid's virtue.  They walked in, neutralized tons of red hot radioactive
      shit and walked back out again.  Not one friggin' alarm chirped.  We
      can't even find which direction they moved the stuff.  Don't bet your
      ass on stoppin 'em."
         The Chairman of The Joint Chiefs-of-Staff was not usually given to
      profanity or excessive conversation.  Saturnine, cool, and aloof were
      the adjectives most often attached to his name.  He had, however, never
      faced the possible loss of his entire arsenal of atomic weapons.  He
      was understandably upset.  The muscles of his powerful jaw line were
      flexing and relaxing, exercising to some unheard music, or perhaps
      chewing on his image of someone who would dare screw up the entire
      world.
         All eight men in the room had just returned from the War Room.  They
      were fully aware that the room would be obsolete in less than ten
      hours, if the threat was real.  The room, like the men who held the
      reins of power, had been framed and built of the seasoned timber of the
      atomic tree.  No power yet devised by man was more feared and less
      seldom used in anger than the modern thermonuclear bomb.  The crude
      devices dropped over Japan were as unrelated to the modern weapons as
      grandmothers and girlfriends.  While both were female, they were
      definitely treated differently.
         The American leadership knew, from the frenzied visits of Soviet
      diplomats based in Washington, that the U.S.S.R had also enjoyed some
      missing isotopes.  K.G.B. agents, spotted by the stepped up security at
      international airports, were pouring into the U.S.  Moscow had pulled
      out the stops in their efforts to locate this newest, and most
      dangerous terrorist before he could destroy the normal insanity
      everyone thrived upon.
         Terrorists, worldwide, no matter how preposterously remote from
      being able to perform the feats of magic that were confounding
      everyone, were suddenly accompanied by men with both Slavic and Anglo
      appearances.  Anyone buying books, spare parts, or equipment connected,
      no matter how remotely, with radioactivity were detained, photographed,
      followed and generally harassed.  Three teachers from Dallas and their
      friend, a librarian, were arrested when they attempted to purchase the
      usual books they used in science fair projects.  Their indignation
      would cost the taxpayers two million dollars in a false arrest and
      invasion of privacy suit.  The feeding frenzy of effort expanded with
      each passing day, until it seemed the nation was completely captive
      beneath a microscope of surveillance.
      
         On December twenty-fourth, the deadline passed, as the quartz
      accuracy the Pentagon obeyed with Pavlovian regularity marched past six
      P.M.
         The rooms did not move.
         The air remained breathable.
         People sat in hushed groups waiting and gradually began complaining.
      After all it was Christmas Eve and the Bigwigs could solve this crisis
      at a more convenient time.  If they tried.
      
         Sixty quartz clicks later the announcement came that all those below
      the rank of Major General could leave.  The trickle of those who had
      snuck out early became a flood, as people dashed for their cars.  They
      hurried to be first at the traffic jams, and were soon joined by their
      slower coworkers.
      
         Word came to the President nearly eleven hours after the deadline.
         "Mr. President, sorry to disturb you, sir."
         "Go ahead, Major.  Who did we hear from?"
         "One hundred and seventy-sixth Missile Group, between Topeka and
      Kansas City.  They have forty-eight Minute Man missiles..."
         "Well, for God's sake, son.  What happened?"
         "We have confirmed the telex by phone, sir.  They haven't had time
      to open all the warheads, but twenty-seven are filled with pop corn.
         The president swung his feet off of the ottoman and slipped into his
      house slippers.
         "Anything else?"
         "Beg your pardon, sir."
         "Anything unusual left behind?"
         "Well... I didn't ask, sir.  Is it important?"
         "No, Major.  Please keep me posted.  This looks like it will be a
      long day."
         "Yes, sir."
         The president wondered idly how much butter was buried in government
      warehouses.
      
         By ten o'clock the President requested an hourly summary from
      communications.  The calls had quickly become continuous, all
      delivering the same message.  The United States military might was
      heading toward cornering the market in impotent military hardware and
      pop corn.
         By six P.M., twenty-four hours after the deadline, the reports were
      nearly complete.  Including the most secret locations in outer space,
      and the most public silos in Kansas, there was not a single nuclear
      warhead in the United States that was anything but a very expensive
      snack can.  One report arrived by courier and included a drawing of
      Tinkerbell.
         A six thirty hot line call to the Kremlin, delayed by the usual
      clicks and snaps of recording devices and eavesdroppers, produced a
      weary Russian Chairman.  From the Chairman's denials and the angry and
      confused discussion in the background, the President knew that The Iron
      Curtain had not delayed the green garbed fairy.  He considered, for one
      devilish moment, asking if the Premier could use Captain Hook's help.
      He bit his tongue, remembering the Soviet sense of humor.
         "Mr. Premier, we will be forced to forego the pleasure of meeting in
      May.  Not much need discussing arms limitations, now."
         "Da.  Some other time, perhaps.  Or some other subject."
         "Merry Christmas, Mr. Chairman."
         "We do not celebrate your Christmas."
         "Well then, Happy New Year."
         "Da."
         The phone went dead.

        3:02.
        The glowing red numbers seared through my eyes, imprinting themselves 
onto the back of my retina.  I closed my eyelids, but the phosphorescent glow 
lingered, taunting me.  Mocking me.
        "Not tonight," I groaned.  In a mere four hours I would have to get 
up and I couldn't figure out what was keeping me from slipping into sweet 
oblivion.  But in the deep recesses of my mind, I knew what kept me awake.  
Revenge.  Revenge from the spirit of my last alarm clock.  
        Last week, my previous alarm clock died a sudden, violent death.  It 
hit a wall going about forty miles an hour.  The clock was going about forty 
miles an hour, not the wall.  And I was the one who threw it at said wall.  I 
admit it was a childish thing to do, but that incessant chirping noise bored 
into my brain and woke up some primitive, impulsive part of me.  Before I 
knew it, my poor innocent little clock lie in a myriad of plastic and 
electronic pieces all over my floor.  Now, its soul inhabited my new clock 
and it was punishing me with insomnia until I made amends.  I was pondering 
what an alarm clock would accept as a sacrifice when the sound of the 
doorbell echoed through my small apartment.           
        I hopped out of bed, smiling as I went through the living room to the 
front door.  Ha, I could place all the blame on the unsuspecting fool (it 
seemed safer than accusing an inanimate object) who dared to ring my doorbell 
at three o'clock in the morning.  My sleep-deprived mind began to weave 
intricate images of bodily harm upon this unknown interloper.  Iron maidens 
and stretching racks danced in my head as I savagely flipped the dead bolt 
and flung the door open.
        "You'd better be Mr. Sandman himself if you expect to walk away form 
here without a red-hot poker sticking out of your lower orifice!" I growled.
        A bespectacled man in a baby blue robe and fuzzy slippers jumped and 
started to wave his arms.
        "I . . uh . . ah . . . the . . .," he stammered and continued to 
flap.
        I bared my teeth, "Either flap hard enough to fly away or tell me 
what the hell you are doing disturbing me in the middle of my peaceful 
slumber!"   I tend to exaggerate when angered.
        He immediately stopped his flapping and began to fidget with his 
glasses, "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry to . . uh . . disturb your . . uh . . 
peaceful . . uh . . slumber," he finished pitifully.
        "Get it out, man," I demanded, unsympathetic to his plight with 
articulation.
        He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.  Suddenly, like a dam 
bursting, words gushed out of his mouth full force, "I'm so sorry for waking 
you up but I just went through a very strange and disturbing experience and 
I don't know whether I am crazy or not but I just had to see if someone else 
maybe went through the same thing and I know it's a long shot but I have this 
real problem with accepting something like being crazy because I'm a computer 
programmer and I have a very rational and logical mind and to think that 
insanity has entered it like some kind of virus, eating away at the circuits 
and . ."
        "Stop!" I held up my hands, as if they could physically block his 
unending speech from reaching my ears.
        Miraculously, the barrage of verbiage ceased.  
        "Okay," I said with extreme patience.  "You are an upset computer 
programmer who feels the need to rush out at three o'clock in the morning 
and wake up an upset chemistry professor to have a chat.  So I know what you 
are and why you're here.  Now please tell me this - who are you?" 
        This seemed to confuse him, for his brows furrowed and he learned 
back slightly.  "Why I, uh, I'm your next door neighbor.  I live in 3B," he 
pointed to the door down the hall to my left side.  Oh.
        "Oh," I said, "I didn't recognize you in your . ." I looked down at 
his blue robe and fuzzy slippers,". . nightclothes."  As if I would recognize 
him out of them.
        He nodded vigorously, "I understand, I look quite different in my 
casual attire."
        Yeah, a pocket protector makes a world of difference.
        "My name is Gerald Hoffman and I know yours is Dr. Bernadine 
Rimehart," he paused and his face turned scarlet, "I mean, I know your name 
because I, uh, I saw it on the mailbox next to mine downstairs and . ."
        "Just call me Bernie, okay?" I said, sparing him.
        "Bernie?"
        "Yeah, Bernie," refusing to explain.
        I invited him in, hating myself for doing so, but if he flipped and 
began to shoot everyone at work because his next door neighbor wouldn't 
listen to him in his hour of need, I would feel damn guilty.
        Ordering him to sit down on my threadbare couch, I sank into my 
comfortable recliner and prepared myself.
        "Talk," I demanded.
        Gerald looked flustered for a moment and sighed.  "I was in my 
apartment working on a new idea for a database that would virtually 
revolutionize the computer industry because of this . ."
        I cleared my throat loudly.
        He looked guilty, "Sorry.  I was working and I lost track of time.  
When I finally stopped, it was two o'clock.  I went back to the living room, 
that's where I have my computer and everything, and put all my notes in my 
safe,"  He glanced at me, "I keep them in a safe in case the building burns 
down."  
        Thoughtful guy. 
        "Anyway, as I was twisting the knob, I heard this kind of pop."
        "What kind of 'pop'?", regretting the words the instant they came 
out.
        A thoughtful look crossed his face, "It was like a kernel of popcorn 
being popped.  Nothing loud or anything.  Just a pop!."
        "Okay, a pop!.  Go on"
        "So I turned around quickly.  Instinctively.  I didn't even know 
what to expect because I didn't have time to think about it.  But when I 
turned around . . in the middle of the living room there was . . .," he 
faded off, staring into the depths of my scarred coffee table.
        "What?" I said, irritated at my curiosity, "A gigantic roach?  The 
ghost of Orson Wells?  Elvis?"
        He tore his eyes away from the table and looked into my eyes 
imploringly, "I saw a pig."
        A pig?
        "A pig?", I said.
        He looked away and adjusted his glasses, "Well, it sort of looked 
like a pig.  But it was different,"  His eyes met mine once more.  "Its ears 
were wrong and the snout was a little more elongated and it was wearing a 
shiny suit."
        "A Mafia pig?"
        His head shook.  "No, I mean like a shiny space suit."
        Oh God.
        "And he had this glass tube in his hand, it was a hand, not  hoof, 
and he looked at me and then went to the bathroom."
        "In your living room?"  Why this surprised me, I don't know.
        "No, I mean he walked into the bathroom and closed the door.  He was 
in there for about two minutes.  I didn't know what to do.  I just stood 
there until he came out.  And when he came out, he didn't have the glass 
tube.  He walked to the center of my living room and pop! he was gone,"  
Gerald leaned back and put his hands in his lap.
        My mind was blank.  Desperately, I searched for something, anything 
to say.    Something to soothe his deranged psyche.  Something to ease his 
mind out of some low-budget science fiction movie and back to reality.  
Something to get this ranging lunatic out of my apartment.  But what came 
out was, "A pig from outer space used your bathroom."
        Gerald pushed his glasses back into place with a shaking hand, "It 
wasn't really a pig and I don't know if he really . . uh . . used the 
bathroom.  He was in the bathroom, but I don't know what he did.  I think it 
involved the glass tube, though."
        Yeah, right.
        "I know that it sounds absurd, but it really happened.  If it had 
just been a dream, I would have known.  I mean, I would have woken up with 
my head on my desk, but I didn't.  I was standing in the living room when 
the p . . the thing disappeared.  I stood there for a while, like I was in 
shock.  I replayed the whole thing in my head over and over, trying to make 
sense of it.  But I couldn't."
        "So you came over here."
        "I'm sorry, I know you think I'm a psycho, but it happened.  It 
really happened, Bernie,"  Soulful eyes begged me to believe him.
        I didn't need this.  In a few hours, twenty-six students would be 
begging me to tell them all about isotopes and polymers and organic compounds 
so they could get the college part of their lives out of the way and get 
back to the partying, beer-drinking, socializing part.  But instead of the 
efficient and lively teacher of chemicals and compounds they all knew and 
loved, they would find a hysterical, babbling wreck of a human because she 
was torn away from at least a few moments of rest and relaxation to listen 
to the amazing tale of a boy and his pig.  What did I do to deserve this, I 
screamed at any deity bored enough to listen to a common mortal.  My eyes 
fell upon the quivering, pathetic figure before me and I knew what I had to 
do.  I had to lie.
        I scooted myself to the edge of the chair in an attempt to look 
sympathetic and believing.
        "Gerald, many things exist in this world that no one can explain.  
Look at the pyramids, electricity . . ."
        The seventies.
        ". . . Stonehenge.  Your experience is just another unexplainable 
event, like eclipses and lightning was to ancient man."
        Was he buying it?
        His mouth opened slightly and he whispered, "Gosh, I never thought 
about that way."
        I vigorously nodded my head, "Ignorance breeds fear.  I'm sure there 
is a perfectly rational explanation . . ."
        Insanity.
        ". . . for your experience, but until the reason is discovered, 
there is no reason to be afraid."
        "Then . . . you believe me?"
        A motherly smile spread across my face, "Of course!  Something 
certainly did happen to you . . ."
        A brain tumor.
        ". . . that merits understanding, not blind terror."
        "You're right, Bernie.  You're absolutely right.  It's my duty to 
look at this situation with a scientific mind,"  He held his now steady hand 
outwards.  "Like you do.  Solving a problem with observable facts.  That's 
what we need to do!"
        We?
        He went on, "I know we can solve this mystery if we just put our 
minds to it."
        Our ?  Somehow, my attempts to get him out the door had led to him 
planning our research project.
        "We can go back to my apartment and input all known data into my 
computer,"  His lips curved into a smile.  "I built it myself.  Well, I 
didn't really build it, but I put it together and . . ."
        Beeeeep!  This mindless rambling has been interrupted by a special 
service announcement:  Remember the database.
        Ah.  I had an idea.
        "Gerald?" I took his hand.  His clammy, somewhat sticky hand.  I 
tried my hardest to block the images that entered my mind.  
        He looked somewhat confused and began to fidget, "What?"
        "I know it is very important to solve this riddle of the universe as 
soon as possible, but I think you're forgetting something."  
        He still looked confused, "What?" 
        "Your . . uh . . database."
        The light bulb above his head glowed dimly. "My database?"
        Jesus Christ.  "Your database, your pride and joy?"
        His eyes shifted, "What about my database?"
        On a popsicle stick, "If we're spending day and night working on why 
your mysterious friend took a pit stop at you pad, when will you have time 
to finish your database?"
        He stared at the floor and the light bulb increased a few watts.
        Come on, work with me.
        "So . . you think maybe I should finish my database first?"
        Bingo!
        I patted his hand, "It would be in your best interest.  I also have 
several things I have to rap up before I take on this project . . ."
        Like the rest of my life.
        ". . .and it really deserves our full, undivided attention."  
        Gerald took off his glasses and stood up, "You're right!"
        My whole body slumped.  There is a God.
        "I'll perfect my database and then we'll get to work."  He gazed 
down at me with a proud gleam in his eyes.
        "Great idea,"  I said through clenched teeth.
        I escorted him to the door, fighting down the impulse to kick him 
repeatedly, and we said our goodbyes.  In other words, he said goodbye and I 
shoved him out into the hallway, muttering, "Don't call us, we'll call you."
        Yawning, I shuffled into my bedroom and was greeted by a new set of 
glowing numbers.  4:32.
        "More than enough time,"  I sighed and threw myself onto my bed.
        
        I didn't come home till one the next night.  It was wet and dreary, 
fitting my mood perfectly.  No sleep, at total of eighty-nine students 
whining like children because I had scheduled the chemistry exam on the same 
day they had at least twelve different exams and an inescapable teachers 
conference made the idea of becoming Catholic and running off to a convent 
sound perfectly reasonable.  I would pick up a guitar on the way and begin 
committing showtunes to memory.  
        I went to the kitchen and began stuffing the tacos I had picked up 
on my way home into my face.  God invented cafeteria food to torment college 
students, not teachers, and if Mexican fast-food was to be my savior, then 
so be it.  I knew I was provoking my reoccurring dream, in which a 
gargantuan burrito burns me alive at the stake while tostadas and nachos 
dance around brandishing bottles of Pepto-Bismol, to visit me tonight, but 
there was no way I was going to let hunger keep me awake.  Hunger I could 
control, if nothing else.  Maybe, I giggled, a pig in a suit would have the 
honors of setting me ablaze tonight.  I took a gulp of watery, uncarbonated 
cola and prepared to literality drag myself to my bedroom.
        Pop!
        My ears perked up at this sound and I rushed into the living room, 
expecting . . .well, not really knowing what to expect.  At the doorway I 
stopped and Gerald's words echoed in my head.
        "Well, it sort of looked like a pig . . ."
        Oh my god, a PIG.
        ". . . but it was different . . ."
        A pig in my living room.  A pig, after a pop!, in my living room. 
        ". . . it's ears were wrong . . ."
        More like a German Shepherd's ears than a pigs.  Smaller and upright, 
rather than big and floppy.
        ". . . the snout was a little more elongated . . ."
        In fact, it looked prehensile.  An elephant's trunk severally 
shortened to about eight inches.
        ". . . it was wearing a shiny suit . . ."
        It wasn't really a suit.  It looked like someone had wrapped 
aluminum foil all over my visitors little body.
        But other than the ears, the nose, the hands and the suit (which 
covered his piggy or non-piggy feet, I couldn't tell), he looked like a 
definite member of the porcine family.  Approximately three feet tall, the 
perfect shade of pink, little piggy eyes, a rounded body.  Yep, ol' Gerald 
was right about the resemblance.  Then, before I could further commend 
Gerald on his keen talent for observation, Mr. Pseudo-Pig started . . . 
walking? trotting? . . . towards my bathroom.  My eyes zeroed in on the 
object clutched in it's tiny paw.
        ". . . he had this glass tube in his hand . . ."  
        About a foot long and two inches wide, it seemed to be crafted out 
of plastic, rather than glass, and housed a bundle of wires which ran from 
end to end.  Before I could deduce anymore, it reached it's destination and 
closed the door. 
        Maybe it was a high-tech plunger and he was a extremely disfigured 
plumber with a strange mode of transportation.  Maybe Gerald's insanity was 
contagious and I was infected with a new kind of virus (Dementia Porcinus), 
spreading through my mind until I finally ran through the streets screeching 
incoherently at strangers about farm animals and got run over by an elderly 
man in a Buick.  Maybe my taco was laced with LSD.  Maybe I'm dead and this 
is hell.
        Stop it!, the rational part of my mind (what little was left) 
shrieked.  Stop acting like the hysterical, mindless, moronic heroine of a 
bad horror movie and do something constructive!
        "Okay", I said (ignoring the fact that I was talking to myself).  "I 
need to think . . . think . . . . think . . . . ."
        Get on with it!
        "All right!"  God, I was pushy.  Let's see, if Mr. Pseudo-Pig is 
real, he might be dangerous.  A weapon!  I need a weapon!
        I ran to the kitchen and began to frantically search for a cleaver, 
an ice pick, or even a sword.  I came up with a plastic knife from a fast 
food restaurant.  Why didn't I ever learn to cook!
        What about the baseball bat in the closet, Einstein?
        Of course, my baseball bat!
        With one great leap, I hurled myself through the living room and 
into the hall closet.  The door was shut.
        "Ouch" I said.  But I took no notice to the throbbing pain in the 
middle of my forehead and opened the door, grabbed the bat and hopped back 
into the living room to survey the bathroom door.  I was ready.
        As if on cue, out he came.
        I held my bat in front of me and pretended he was just a big, pink 
ball.
        He took a few steps towards me and then, noticing the bat, stopped.  
Tiny, piggy eyes regarded me unblinkingly.
        I tried to look menacing, "What are you doing here, pig-boy?", I 
snarled.
        It turned it's head like a dog hearing a high pitch.  I looked at 
its' hands.  No tube.  I wanted to cry, but I shook my bat in a threatening 
manner instead.  
        It's nose curved upward, as if in disgust.  "I am not here to harm 
you," it said in a quiet voice.
        Yeah, that's what all the brain-sucking aliens say.  I shook the bat 
again and cried, "Then why are you here, in my apartment, using my 
bathroom!"
        Pointy ears perked up and the snout went back down. "Ah, you are 
scared.  I mistook your actions.  Please forgive me."
        It was apologizing?  "Uh, okay," I said stupidly.
        "And I apologize for trespassing on your property.  I know your race 
considers it unlawful, but under the circumstances, I think a break in the 
rules is not important,"  The tiny eyes suddenly blinked rapidly for several 
seconds.
        "What," I said, mesmerized by his fluttering eyes, "are the 
circumstances, if I may ask."
        "Why, to save your planet," astonishment slightly coloring his voice.
        Of course, mentally slapping my forehead, I should have known!
        "You see," he went on, "we, my fellow brothers and I, have foreseen 
the destruction of Earth and I am here to correct things."
        My heart stopped and thundered at the same time.  "You're from the 
future?"
        A sound emitted from the creature that sounded like a twittering 
bird, "Oh no!  That would be impossible.  No, we, my brothers and I, simply 
examine current data to interpret what events will occur next.  The universe 
follows a pattern and if your society ever evolves from its primitive state, 
it will come to this same conclusion."
        Oh God.
        A fortune-telling pig.  No, not just a pig.  A pig and his brothers.  
Laughter welled up deep within my inner being.  Hysterical, maniacal 
laughter.  My brain had turned to mush.  I'm sure I felt it slowly dripping 
out of my ears.
        "But since you can't, we, my brothers and I, felt we had to 
intervene and steer you clear of this disaster."
        What in the hell does that have to do with my bathroom?
        "What does all this have to do with my bathroom?" I asked.
        His ears and snout twitched, "The pattern showed that a global 
catastrophe would occur when everyone on your plant uses their elimination 
systems simultaneously, causing an overload and subsequent eruptions."
        My brain was oozing onto the floor and he expected me to comprehend 
complex sentences?  "What does that mean?"
        "Everyone flushes at the same time and the sewers blow up."
        Oh God.
        "Persons with their own personal septic systems and others with no 
sanitation systems will not be affected by this at first, but with the 
methane 'fallout', they will be dead within a week or two."
        Dead.  Like a ton of bricks, the word hit me and I almost doubled 
over from the pain it held.  Everyone dead.  Gone.  Ceasing to exist.  But 
wait!  Ol' Pinky and his band of benevolent brothers are in the midst of 
saving us from the fifth horseman (Commodial catastrophes, right after 
Famine).  Snatched, at the last minute from the icy hands of the Grim 
Reaper.  Everything's okay.  The sun will continue to shine.  The birds will 
continue to sing.  Everything will be all right.
        The pig took no notice to my change from dribbling idiot to serene 
idiot.  "The device that we, my brothers and I, are putting in your toilet 
will prevent this devastation."
        Great guys, him and his brothers.  "So, do you go around saving 
planets or something?"  
        "Oh no.  It is our philosophy not to interfere with any 
developments, hazardous or beneficiary, of a world under our, my brothers 
and my, observation.  The inhabitants of your planet still have a good 
chance of self-destruction despite our intervention."
        "Then . . . why are you doing this?"
        He paused in thought and looked up at me, "For an entire race to be 
obliterated because of a inefficient sewage system, it's just too . . .", 
his eyes shifted downwards, then met mine once again, ". . . embarrassing."
And with those final words, he went to the center of my living room and pop!.
        How long I stood there, my eyes fixed on the spot where he 
disappeared, I do not know.  Finally, I realized I was staring at the carpet 
and forced my body to move towards my comfortable recliner.  I collapsed 
into it and slowly, the gears in my mind began to turn again.  And I 
thought.
        While I sat in my comfortable recliner and pondered the existence of 
life, people all over the world slept or worked or sat around, not knowing 
how close they had been to certain death.  Next door, Gerald dreamed a dream 
in algorithms and binary numbers.  And somewhere out there, pigs really did 
fly.

Where Love Resides
------------------

Quietly the darkness reigns
under her watchful care
evening shadows linger
erasing childhood's fears with
nurturing hands.

Making the best of life
and love with what she had, she was
ready to face the 
challenges of each new day
every moment that passes, her
love and laughter ring thru my mind
lingering to remember her
always.

Lively conversation
awaited all who came near
unpretentious and genuine
even to the end.
nestled in her arms
bad dreams once slipped away
escaping this dream called life
returning home.  Home - to
golden gates...or pearly ones?

written by Tamara 11/16/94

I read this at the memorial service for my mom who died on the 9th - 
the poem contains her name, and I hope - her spirit.  I only wrote one 
poem for her while she was alive.....it was heartfelt, but not very 
good and I found it ten years later still on her dresser as I was 
cleaning up.  Took me a week to write this....

It sits beside a cupie doll, dusty and spent

Sex On the Beach
Copyright (c) 1994, Sean A. Donahue

As the sun begins to set
and the moon seems to glow.
The sex on the beach with
the waves far below.
The ocean and gulls,
wandering in air.
But you and your lover,
don't seem to care.
The passion is building,
like the waves to the shore.
The water comes nearer
closer than before.
Till the wave is upon you.
The feelings of high,
and as quick as it came,
it soon said goodbye.
The tide goes down,
the waves do not reach.
But the footprints remain
from the sex on the beach

Upon the Paths of thirty-two
I walk where few will dare
Every darkened corner retains
Creatures of my wildest imaginations

Queen of Wands, Queen of Cups
Understand the Punishment
Comprehend the Knowledge
Friends left far behind
Have changed without you
Now only distant memories
You can never go home again

Four of Swords, Judgement
Within Fire is Mercy
The pain of Experience
Yields a lifetime of lessons
Unknown to your reason
Shaping, molding your destiny
Into something you barely know

The Hanged Man, Nine of Cups
Within Life there are Crossroads
Soon you will understand
"Why did I choose this Path?"

 
 
What is Love?
Copyright (c) 1994, Jeremy Yocum
All rights reserved



 What is Love?
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

I love you,
And I care about you,
No matter what happens,
We're gonna pull through.

No one can change that,
Not even me.
Why are you crying?

If love is blind,
It's 'cause you can't see
Through the tears.

        Love is patient,
        Love is kind.
        It does not envy,
        It does not boast,
        It is not proud.
        It is not rude,
        It is not self seeking,
        It is not easily angered,
        It keeps no record of wrongs.
        Love does not delight in evil,
        But rejoices with the truth.
        It always protects,
        Always trusts,
        Always hopes,
        Always perserveres.

I love you,
And I care about you,
If the world ends tomorrow,
We're gonna pull through.

Why are you crying?
Seems every time I get close,
I'm inches from embracing you,
Satan pulls you away.
Or is it God?

I pray to Him daily
To not let me lose you.

Love and Pain walk hand in hand,
But is it worth it in the end?
All's well that's well now,
The end doesn't matter until the end.

Why are you crying?

        If I speak in the tongues
        Of men and angels,
        But I do not have you,
        My words are meaningless.

        If I know the future,
        And everything else there is to know,
        And I can move mountains,
        I am nothing without you.

        I can give all I own to the poor,
        And give up all foolish pride,
        But if I do not have you,
        I have nothing on my side.

I love you,
And I care about you,
If I owned the world,
I'd never want to lose you.

I remember the first time
We said "I love you,"
I felt my heart shiver,
You said you did too.

Now it hurts to
Talk to you,
But I love you so much,
I just can't bear not to.

God gave every man a choice,
And I take mine to be with you,
If that's what it takes
To be loved by you.

        Love never fails.
        Prophecies cease,
        Words are silenced,
        Knowledge is forgotten.

        We know in part,
        We prophesy in part,
        But when the perfect comes,
        The imperfect departs.

        When I was a child,
        I talked like a child,
        I thought like a child,
        I reasoned like a child.

        When I became a man,
        I put my childish ways behind me.

        Now we see
        But a poor reflection,
        As in a mirror.
        Then, we shall see
        face to face.

        Now I know in part,
        Then I shall know fully,
        Even as I am fully known.

I love you,
And I care about you,
If you put your hand in mine,
We'll always pull through.

Why are you crying?

Love and pain walk hand in hand,
But is it worth it in the end?
All's well that's well now,
The end won't matter 'till the end.

I've never found a love like yours,
Probably never will again.
We may part with broken hearts,
But I'll never be the same.

Why are you crying?

        Love never failed,
        Prophecies ceased,
        Words are silent,
        Knowledge is forgotten.

        And now these three remain:
        Faith, hope, and Love,

        But the greatest of these is LOVE!

(why are you crying???)

 Afterbirth
 ----------
 by Debbie Burns



 --April--
 
 I packed you away in a box and pushed you to the back of a closet,
 but I could not lose you. My Maggie looks at me with your eyes; my
 Kate touches me with your fingers.
 
 At the moment of conception I laughed with the joy of loving you. At
 six months our daughters too laugh-- gummily, heads thrown back,
 tiny hands clutching a dog-eared Daddy:  your photograph with its
 frozen smile.
 
 Someday you will meet them, these twins of our creation. You will
 look at Maggie with her eyes; you will touch Kate with her fingers.
 And I, I will weep with the joy of losing you.
 
 --June--

 The fantasy gave way to reality: I wept but could not lose you;
 could feel my marrow gelling, instead, wanting to fit my bones into
 the mold of yours. Maggie and Kate--more mine than yours, but ours,
 nevertheless-- think you're a weekend playmate.  Daddy.
 
 I gave you these children; I bear the scar to prove it-- a six-inch
 red line searing my abdomen. It hurts rarely now, only when tiny
 feet kick in impatience to be rid of imprisoning arms and late at
 night when I imagine you breathing beside me. Turning to face you, I
 see that you're not. That's when the wound gapes inside of me,
 opening to my womb, where it all began.
 
 --October--

 My life swirls with two dirty diapers in the toilet. A year now of
 being nothing more than a glorified nanny, not even the dignity of
 wife and mother. Next year, you say, next year I'll marry you.
 
 He loves me, he loves me not, he loves me . . . we've been this
 route before.
 
 A ring on my finger and a bell through my nose. What do you think I
 do all day, Daddy dearest, while you live at college-- watch soaps
 and paint my toenails? I scream, I cry, I wipe noses and asses and
 thank god my punishment wasn't triplets.
 
 Do you know what I do, the days nothing goes right? When the
 one-sided conversations turn into screaming bouts? When food is on
 the ceiling and blood has flown more than once, when the tantrums
 last longer than the giggles? Those are the days I curse you and my
 overproductive ovaries.

 There are several different ways to get STTS magazine.


 SysOps:

 Contact me via any of the addresses listed in CONTACT POINTS listed
 elsewhere in this issue. Just drop me a note telling me your name,
 city, state, your BBS's name, it's phone number and it's baud rate, and
 where you'll be getting STTS from each month. If your BBS carries RIME,
 Pen & Brush Network, or you have access to the InterNet, I can put you
 on the STTS mailing list to receive the magazine free of charge each
 month. If you have access to FIDO, you can file request the magazine.
 If you don't have access to any of these services - or do but don't
 wish to use this option - you can call any of the BBS's listed in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES and download the new issue each month. In either
 case contact me so that I can put your BBS in the dist.  site list for
 the next issue of the magazine.

 (Refer to DISTRIBUTION VIA NETWORKS for more detailed information about
  the nets)


 Users:

 You can download STTS each month from any of the BBS's mentioned in
 DISTRIBUTION SITES elsewhere in this issue. If your local BBS isn't
 listed, pester and cajole your SysOp to "subscribe" to STTS for you.
 (the subscription, of course, is free)



 If you haven't any other way of receiving the magazine each month, a
 monthly disk subscription (sent out via US Mail) is available for 
 $ 20.00 per year. Foreign subscriptions are $ 25.00 (american dollars).

 Subscriptions should be mailed to:

 Submission Information
 ----------------------


 We're looking for a few good writers.

 Actually, we're looking for as many good writers as we can find. We're
 interested in fiction, poetry, reviews, feature articles (about most
 anything, as long as it's well-written), humour, essays, ANSI art, 
 and RIP art.

 STTS is dedicated to showcasing as many talents as it can, in all forms
 and genres. We have no general "theme" aside from good writing,
 innovative concepts, and unique execution of those concepts.

 As of January 1st 1994, we've been PAYING for accepted submissions!  

 In a bold move, STTS has decided to offer an incentive for writers to
 submit their works. For each accepted submission, an honorarium fee
 will be paid upon publication. Premium access to STTS BBS is also
 given to staff and contributing writers.

 In addition to the monthly payments, STTS will hold a yearly "best of"
 contest, where the best published stories and articles in three
 categories will receive substantial cash prizes. 

 These changes took effect in January of 1994, and the first yearly
 awards were presented in the July 1994 issue. 

 Honorariums, yearly cash awards, award winners selection processes, and
 Contributor BBS access is explained below:


HONORARIUM

 Each and every article and story accepted for publication in STTS will
 received a cash honorarium. The payment is small and is meant as more
 of a token than something to reflect the value of the submission. 

 As the magazine grows and brings in more money, the honorariums will
 increase, as will the yearly award amounts.


   Fiction pieces pay an honorarium of $2.00 each.
   Poetry pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each
   Non-fiction* pieces pay an honorarium of $1.00 each


 You have the option of refusing your honorarium. Refused funds will be
 donated to the American Cancer Society.

 Staff members ARE eligible for honorariums.

 * Non-fiction includes any feature articles, humor, reviews, and
   anything else that doesn't fit into the fiction or poetry category.


YEARLY CASH AWARD

 Once a year, In July, the staff of STTS magazine will meet and vote on
 the stories, poems, and articles that have appeared in the last six
 issues of the magazine. Each staff member (the publisher included) gets
 one vote, and can use that vote on only one entry in each category. 

 In the unlikely event of a tie, the winners will split the cash award.

 Winners will be announced in the July issue of the magazine. 

 Yearly prize amounts
 --------------------

 Fiction         $50.00
 Non-fiction      25.00
 Poetry           25.00


 The winner in each category does have the option of refusing his cash
 award. In the event of such a refusal, the entire sum of the refused
 cash awards will be donated to the American Cancer Society.


STTS BBS

  Staff members and contributing writers will also receive level 40
  access on Sunlight Through The Shadows BBS. Such access consists of 2
  hrs. a day, unlimited download bytes per day, and no download/upload
  ratio. A regular user receives 1 hr. a day and has an download/upload
  ratio of 10:1.

  Staff and contributing writers also receive access to a special
  private STTS Staff conference on the BBS.


LIMITATIONS

  STTS will still accept previously published stories and articles for
  publication. However, previously published submissions do NOT qualify
  for contention in the yearly awards.

  Furthermore, previously published stories and articles will be paid at
  a 50% honorarium of the normal honorarium fee.


RIGHTS

 The copyright of said material, of course, remains the sole property
 of the author. STTS has the right to present it once in a "showcase"
 format and in an annual "best of" issue. (a paper version as well
 as the elec. version)

 Acceptance of submitted material does NOT necessarily mean that it
 will appear in STTS.

 Submissions should be in 100% pure ASCII format, formatted for 80
 columns. There are no limitations in terms of lengths of articles, but
 keep in mind it's a magazine, not a novel. <Grin>

 Fiction and poetry will be handled on a pure submission basis, except
 in the case of any round-robin stories or continuing stories that might
 develop. 

 Reviews will also be handled on a submission basis. If you're
 interested in doing a particular review medium (ie: books) on a
 full-time basis, let me know and we'll talk.

 ANSI art should be under 10k and can be about any subject as long as
 it's not pornographic. We'll feature ANSI art from time to time,
 as well as featuring a different ANSI "cover" for our magazine each
 month.

 In terms of articles, we're looking for just about anything that's
 of fairly general interest to the BBSing world at large. An article
 comparing several new high-speed modems would be appropriate, for
 example, whereas an article describing in detail how to build your
 own such modem really wouldn't be.

 Articles needn't be contained to the world of computing, either.
 Movies, politics, ecology, literature, entertainment, fiction,
 non-fiction, reviews - it's all fair game for STTS.

 Articles, again, will be handled on a submission basis. If anyone has
 an idea or two for a regular column, let me know. If it works, we'll
 incorporate it into STTS.

    Advertising
    -----------

 Currently, STTS Mag is being "officially" carried by over 90 BBS's
 across the United States. It's also being carried by BBS's in the
 United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal, and Finland. 

 Unofficially (which means that the SysOps haven't yet notifed me that
 they carry it) it's popped up on literally hundreds of BBS's across the
 USA as well as in other countries including the UK, Canada, Portugal, 
 Ireland, Japan, The Netherlands, Scotland, and Saudi Arabia.

 It's also available via Internet, FIDO, RIME, and
 Pen & Brush Networks.

 Currently, STTS has about 10,000 readers worldwide and is available
 to literally millions of BBSers through the internet and other 
 networks and BBS's.

 If you or your company want to expose your product to a variety of
 people all across the world, this is your opportunity!

 Advertising in Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available
 in four different formats:




 1) Personal Advertisements  (NON-Business)
    -----------------------

 Personal advertisements run $5.00 for 4 lines of advertising, with each
 additional line $1.00. Five lines is the minimum length. Your ad can be
 as little as one line, but the cost is still $5.00. 

 Advertisements should be in ASCII and formatted for 80 columns. They
 should include whatever you're trying to sell (or buy) as well as a
 price and a method of contacting you. 

 ANSI or RIP ads at this level will NOT be accepted.

 Business ads will NOT be accepted here. These ads are for non-business
 readers to advertise something they wish to sell or buy, or to
 advertise a non-profit event. 

 BBS ads are considered business ads.


 2) Regular Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We're accepting business advertisements in STTS.  If you're interested
 in advertising in STTS, a full-page (ASCII or ASCII and ANSI) is
 $25.00/issue. Those interested can contact me by any of the means
 listed under Contact Points.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($125.00) the sixth month is
 free.


 3) Feature Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    ---------------------

 We'll include one feature ad per issue. The feature ad will pop up
 right after the magazine's ANSI cover, when the user first begins to
 read the magazine. This ad will also appear within the body of the
 magazine, for further perusement by the reader.

 A feature ad will run $50.00 per issue, and should be created in
 both ANSI and ASCII formats.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($250.00) the sixth month is
 free. 


 4) BBS Advertisement (Business or Personal)
    -----------------

 Many BBS SysOps and users call STTS BBS each month to get the current
 issue of STTS Magazine. These callers are from all over the USA as well
 as Canada, Portugal, the UK, and various other countries.

 Advertising is now available for the logoff screen of the BBS. The
 rates are $100.00 per month. Ads should be in both ASCII and ANSI
 format. We're accepting RIP ads as well, but only for the this
 advertising option.

 If you purchase 5 months of advertising ($500.00) the sixth month is
 free.



    Advertisement Specifications
    ----------------------------

 Ads may be in as many as three formats. They MUST be in ascii text and
 may also be in ANSI and/or RIP Graphics formats. 

 Ads should be no larger than 24 lines (ie: one screen/page) and ANSI
 ads should not use extensive animation. 

 If you cannot make your own ad or do not have the time to make your
 own ad, we can make it for you. However, there is a one-time charge of
 $10.00 for this service. We will create ads in ASCII and ANSI only. If
 you absolutely need RIP ads and cannot create your own, we'll attempt
 to put you into contact with someone who can.

Sunlight Through The Shadows Magazine is available through FIDO,
INTERNET, RIME, and PEN & BRUSH NET. Check below for information on how
to request the current issue of the magazine or be put on the monthly
mailing list.


                         FIDO

To get the newest issue of the magazine via FIDO, you'll need to
do a file request from Fido Node 1:124/8010 using the "magic" name
of SUNLIGHT.


                       INTERNET

To get on the STTS mailing list, do the following:


  Send internet mail message to:


        JDeRouen@CRL.COM                  

And ask to be put on the list.  



                         RIME

To request the magazine via RIME, ask your RIME SysOp to do a file
request from node # 5320 for the current issue (eg: sun9408.ZIP, or
whatever month you happen to be in) Better yet, ask your SysOp to
request to be put on the monthly mailing list and receive STTS
automatically.

                    PEN & BRUSH NET

To request via P&BNet, follow the instructions for RIME above. They're
both ran on Postlink and operate exactly the same way in terms of file
requests and transfers.


I'd like to thank Texas Talk BBS and Archives On-Line BBS for allowing
me to access the Internet and Fido (respectively) from their systems.

Okay, okay.  So the editorial wasn't exactly true.  So maybe we skipped
a month because we got behind, and there really didn't seem to be any
other choice. 

Regardless, though, Tommy Van Hook really *is* on the staff now, and his
contributions have proven invaluable to the magazine.  So that part was
true.

And, really, for all I know, masked ninja's *are* after me.  I have a
feeling they've been sent my Smoke and Mirrors published Lucia Chambers
as my revenge for a lack of involvement in the wonderful Pen & Brush
Network lately.  See, Lucia, I know what you're up to.  If the ninjas
come and get me, I'll know it was you.

*Ahem*  Well, okay, maybe not.

Anyway, enjoy this issue and the great pieces contained herein!  We'll
try to put out a more timely magazine in the future.  But no promises.
After all, the ninjas might be reading . . . :)
