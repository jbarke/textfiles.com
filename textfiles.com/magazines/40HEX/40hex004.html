                               Whats New
                               ---------

     Well a lot of things been going on this month.  Well I've been
     really lazy lately and haven't gotten around to writing this issue
     for over two months I guess.  Well let me tell you whats been going
     on.

     Let me take the time now to address these lame fucking people who,
     if they had 9600+ modems, would be wares puppies, but being they
     have a 2400 they decide to practice there leeching habits on
     viruses.  They are the virus collectors, they ones who never run
     the damn things, just add them to there collection and upload them
     here and there to be really, as they say, "K-K00\_."  Please
     mother fuckers, stop.  I mean look at the Red Cross virus, does
     anyone have the real copy of it?  Some lame ass collector found
     something that scanned as Red-X and was "/> a |)" enough to upload
     it everywhere.  Please, give it up.  Virus BBS's are a great thing,
     and without them we would be lost, but by the same tolken these
     collectors, or as someone once said, "Micro-Wares Puppies," must
     get with the program or die.

     Well second of all, I've been calling The Homebase quite a bit
     lately and came to one conclusion, people are dumb.  Look in this
     issue for some scroll backs of stupid things people have posted on
     that BBS this month or so.

     The Bob Ross virus has been released in the mist, so watch what you
     D/L.  Hmmmm, I think SCAN 85 caught it, but that will change soon,
     right DA?

     Funny story.  I infected my schools computer with several viruses
     before I transferred out.  Well what I heard happened from that is
     this.  They somehow could not get the viruses to dissapper no
     matter what they did.  Incedently it was Whale and some other
     viruses. Anyway, out of the fustration of the viruses reappering
     all the time, they decided to out and get rid of all the hard
     drives.  So they removed all the hard drives from all the systems
     and put them in storage.  Anyway, they finally got a virus expert
     to come it, he said that they didn't have to get rid of the hard
     drives he can rid the viruses.  Well to late.  The art department
     had got a hold of them and wealded them together into one big
     statue!  Thousands of dollars worth of hardware down they drain.
     The school was so embarressed at the whole thing they shipped the
     statue way out of state where so everybody would soon forget this
     screwup.  Thanks to Shade of Sorrow for finding that one out for
     me.

     SCAN 85 _is_ out, 'nuff said.

     Bet you all heard the story about Novell and Stoned III?  If not
     this is the run down.  Novell got infected by Stoned III.  Novell
     distributed infected copies of the December update to everyone.
     That's the story.

                           The Bob Ross Virus

This is the infamous Bob Ross virus by Dark Angel of Phalcon/Skism.

Here's a bit from the author first.

 The Funky Bob Ross Virus Version 1.0
 Written by Dark Angel / 26 September 1991 / (c) 1991
 PHALCON/SKISM Co-op
 Effective length: 1125, Resident length: 672 bytes

 DEDICATION:
   This virus was written expressedly to
      1) Piss off Patty Hoffman, John McAffee, Ross Greenberg, and all the
         other guru-wanna-bes in this world.
      2) Spread the message of The Almighty Bob, and so enrichen the lives
         of people all over the world.
      3) Show off (Now I can tell people that I wrote a virus!)

 WHAT THIS IS:
   This is a self-encrypting, non-overwriting COM infector.  It doesn't do
   anything to EXE files.  File sizes increase by 1117 bytes.  It goes off
   on July 9th of any year or after 7 infection "waves."

 WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT GOES OFF:
   The virus goes memory resident and prints out a Bobism every 5 minutes.
   It then enters a delay loop for approximately 5 seconds, allowing for a
   brief moment of silence while the victim reads Bob's holy message.  The
   virus will not destroy anything.  The virus will not go TSR if it finds
   another copy of itself in memory.

  
 Well, here it is, the hex dump, by now you should know how to compile
 it from the hex dump.

The virus itself is only 1125 bytes, this file is 3125 to account for an
infected file.

Scan 85 detects it as the [Beta] virus, but strain-b will be out soon.


40Hex Issue 4                                            December 1991


                             The Sunday Virus

        According to Patty Hoffman, the Sunday virus is based on the 
Jerusalem viruses, because the codes for both viruses are similar.  
Sunday infects COM, EXE, and OVL files, when they are executed, and it 
stays resident in memory.  It was circulated around the Seattle, 
Washington area in 1989, and is quite common.  Sunday can be picked up 
by almost every scanner out there.  The SCAN ID code for this virus  
is "CD 21 80 FC 04 75 10" in lines 01E0 and 01F0.
        This version of Sunday doesn't seem to print any messages on 
the screen, however, some versions do, every Sunday.  This virus 
spreads rapidly, and replicates quite well. 


      To create SUNDAY.COM, cut out the following code, and name the 
resulting file sunday.txt.  Then, use this command:  DEBUG < SUNDAY.TXT

                                                       --DecimatoR

"No feelings of what I left behind, no guilt for the victims of my
 crime.  No compassion, just a burning deep inside.  No pain... I'm here
 just to die... " - Sub Zero


This artical is from the 11/26/91 morning final of the San Jose Mercury News

**text written like this is my comments**

                 SURVEY DEFLATES COMPUTER-VIRUS DANGERS

But safeguards are few as cases proliferate.

  Computer viruses, those nasty bits of distructive programming unleashed
by deviant hackers, are multiplying at a startling rate - but haven't
proved nearly as troublesome as once feared and aren't scaring users
enough to take even simple safeguards.
   Dataquest Inc. a marker research firm in San Jose released a
groundbreaking 150-page survey Monday showing that almost two-thirds of
business and government orginazatons with more than 300 personal
computers has encountered a viurs at least once this year.  Yet only 15
percent of them has installed anti-virus software.
   What's more, Dataquest found the virus encounters more than doubled
in each of the first three quarters of 1991. **<smile, smile>**
   The National Computer Security Association of Washington D.C., which
represents 1,000 developers of anti-virus software, hired Dataquest to
conduct what is apparently the first study of virus proliferation by a
reseacher not directly employed by an anti-virus software company.
   Computer viruses hide themselves in legitamate files, jumping from
machine to machine.  Triggered either at random or on a set date, such
as Friday the 13th, the most destructive viruses gobble up programs and
data in their host computers. **gobble???**
   Robert Morris, then a student at Cornell University, unleashed a
the biggest virus to date in November 1988 **please** when a program he
intended to queitly slip onto a network call Internet went out of
control and temporally shut down 6,000 computers at universitys and
government reaserch labrotorys nationwide.  In the wake of the Internet
case, there were dire predictions of future virus attacks the could
bring the entire economy grinding to a halt.
    But there haven't been any major virus outbreaks since then and, it
turnded out, the Internet virus **Internet worm, damn it!!!** did little
permanent damage.
    What's more, most viruses are relitavely mild - more like a case of
sniffles the double pnemonia.  Typically, these mild viruses take up
space in the computers memory and slow down operations, but don't
destroy data. ** :) :( **
    "Many viruses are very innocuous," said Shella Cotter, director of
software consulting for Dataquest. "You find them, you identify them and
you get rid of them."
    "Many of the viruses I've heard about have not been big problems,"
added Jay BloomBecker ** tell me he aint gay **, director of the
National Center for Computer Crime Data in Santa Cruz.  "But it's
significant enough that if you're not paying attention to it, you
security is probably inadeqaute."
    Anti-virus software sold over the counter automatcally plucks out
the most of the roughly, 1,000 viruses identifey thoughout the world.
Occasoinally however, killer viruses can take over an entire computer
system and threaten a buisness with massive losses of crucial
information.
    Dataquest talked to 600 orginazations during October and dicovered
that 63 percent had encountered at least one virussince the beginning of
the year.  Of these reporting and encounter, 62 percent claimed "a
definite loss of productivity," although the $70,000 study did not
tabulate the total cost.
    In the survey group, 9 percent reported a "virus disaster," defined
as a single incedent affecting 25 or more personal computers or
diskettes.  On average, computers involved in a virus disaster were out
of commision four days and required reprogramming at a cost of $6,200.
    And, in 3 percent of virus attacks, either the person who introduced
the virus or the person responible for computer security was threatened
with dismmisal.  Dataquest didn't count how many were actually fired.
    "Computer viruses are much more prevalent than people think and,
unless we think, and unless we take precautions, over time they are
going to get worse," said Andrew Seybold, head of the Dataquest servey
team.
    But anti-virus software and strict enforcement of computer scurity
policies could change in the future.
    "The good news is, it's solveable.  The bad news is companies aren't
chossing to solve it,", Cotter concluded.  ** The other way around for
us **

                         The Typo COM Virus

        The Typo Virus comes in 2 forms - a boot sector infector, and a 
COM file infector.  This version is the COM version.  The effective 
length of the virus is 867 bytes, and it only infects COM files.  Typo 
stays resident, and can infect files whether they are run or not, from my 
experience.  Typo isn't a destructive virus, but it does garble any 
output to the parallel ports, by exchanging certain letters with others 
that sound similar, and by transposing numbers.  Sometimes it replaces 
one number with an entirely different number.  Typo is believed to have 
originated in Israel, because some Hebrew letters are changed when it is 
active, and it was isolated in that country.  Typo is easily detected by 
SCAN, and the scan string is "A1 58 00 2E 89 84 99 FE 26 A1 5A 00" in lines
400 and 410 of the hex dump, below.

To assemble TYPO.COM, cut out the following hex, and name the resulting 
file TYPO.  Then, issue the command DEBUG < TYPO and you will have a 
working version of the virus.

Hi.  Is there a known virus which displays a screen which reads "INC, for
quality cracks?"  I have recently inherited a computer at the company I work at
and there was apparently some tetris and blockout games on the disk which are
the source of this message.  I found a file called "runme.bat" with the text in
it, but even after I deleted it, it still pops up the aforementioned message.
Also, the message gives me a choice of EGA CGA or monochrome and in general,
the message makes life difficult for me.
        any help with this would be vastly appreciated.

If you can upload a copy of an infected file, we can see if it contains viral
code.

It's not a virus.  INC is the International Network of Crackers.  What they do
is unprotect games and distribute them.  What you do have is most likely
illegally obtained software.

                           The Marauder Virus
                           ------------------


    December marks the first year of the group Skism.  The alliance of
    Phalcon/Skism took place around July 1991.  Me and a few freinds at
    school started the group by hacking old viruses into new strains.
    Well I have lost contact with these people since then and a new
    breed of members has risen from the ashes.

    Well, I myself have learned a lot over the year.  I went from virus
    hacker with about three viruses to my name, to overwritting man,
    to what I am now.  An advanced (kind of) level assembler programmer,
    writing parasitic infectors.  Well come this time next year I belive
    I'll be into more major stuff, ya know sick mother fucking DIR-2
    type action.  I've written a couple of TSR viruses shells, nothing
    completed yet.  Well anyway here's my personal latest creation -
    Marauder.  What Marauder is, is this ----

Marauder Virus
By Hellraiser
of Phalcon/Skism

Aliases: Deadpool-B, 808-B, 860.

Marauder is a non-overwriting, non-resident, encrypting, semi-mutating,
.COM file infector.

When a file is infected with the Marauder Virus the virus will search
the current path for a .COM file and infect it, adding 860 bytes to the
files size.  If not .COM files reside in the current directory, the
virus will go up one directory and check for .COM files to infect untill
it reaches the root.  At the root directory the virus will scan for
other directorys to find .COM files, until one uninfected .COM file is
found.  If no .COM files are found on the disk the virus will terminate
it search and return to the currently running program.

If an infected file is run on Feburary second of any year, the virus
will destroys all files in the current directory, by overwritting them
with message code.  The files will not run when executed, just terminate
upon reading the first line.  There is no way to recover the files once
the virus destroys them.  After this control will be given back to the
host program.

The Maruder virus is able to infect any .COM file no matter what
attribute... Hidden, System, Read-Only, etc... The files date, time, and
attribute will not be changed after a file becomes infected.

The virus will not cause a system error if run on a write-protected
floppy or fixed-disk, merely terminate any attempt of infection.

The virus will not infect files under 16 bytes or over 64,675 bytes.

For the most part the virus is randomly encrypted with each passing
infection, the small part of the program code which is not encrypted
mutates between two different, but comaptable strain of bytes.

There is not way of detecting the virus infections other than the
addition of 860 bytes to infected files, in other words, system-run time
is not affected at all.  If any run-time is affected it is the split
second it takes for the virus to infect a file.

The virus causes no damage to disk sectors or boot records etc... The
only perminate damage is the destuction of all files in the current
directory on 02/02/XX.

And here it is...

40Hex Issue 4                                            December 1991

                      Hacked Pklite File Scanning
                      ---------------------------

   In issue two, i belive it was.  I release a method of making Pklite
   files un-uncompressable and un-detectable.  Well seems a few people
   used the trick for wrong doing.  What do I mean by wrong doing you
   ask?  Well lets just say lame trojans and such.

   Anyway, I had a few sysops on my ass about the trick and so, so now I
   am must release.... The hacked Pklite scanning strings.   Well I
   could really give a fuck if someones BBS gets crashed, but then again
   I am freinds with a lot of sysops.  And besides I have a new trick
   anyway :)

   Well there are two strings.  One for .EXE files and one for .COM
   files.  And here they are.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   "01 F0 FF 50 00 00 00 03 01" Pklite EXE
   "53 33 DB 53 CB 03 01"       Pklite COM

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's my new trick???  Well I won't reveal it at this point... But here
is a another compression trick.  It lets you compress a file with Pklite
then again with LZExe.

First
-----

Compress the file with Pklite

Next
----

Compress the file with LZExe

It wont let you cause the file becomes bigger...

But
---

Use the DOS Undelete function to undelete the file ?zexe.tmp.  Thats the
twice compressed file.  Rename it to what you want.  Destroy the LZ
header... And there you have it...

             A Further Look Into Cracking Encrypted Virues
             ---------------------------------------------


    In Censor #1, Rabids' Data Disruptor showed a way to decrypt
    encrypted viruses.  The only problem with the method shown is that
    once you decrypt the virus, it cannot be run without modification.
    I wish to take his theory a little farther, with a different
    approch.

    There is a really simple way around the problem.  What you will
    need is a debugger.  I perfer Turbo Debugger, by Borland.  However
    if you are good at the DOS utility Debug, you may be able to follow
    along.

    The routine to unencrypt is simple, really simple.  What you will
    need to do is make a small target file for the virus to infect.  A
    100 byte of less file is perfered.

    Step One
    --------

    Copy the target file to a different filename to make two copies of
    the file.  Example - COPY TARGET.COM DUDE.COM

    Step Two
    --------

    Infect one of the files, however the virus infectes the file.
    Remember just infect one of the files.

    Step Three
    ----------

    Load up you dubugger (I'm gonna give Turbo Debugger steps, so people
    with Debug and the Microsoft Debugger will have to improvise) and
    get ready to single step through the virus.

    Step Four
    ---------

    Start single stepping through the virus.  If the virus is encrypted
    you will hit a loop somwhere near the beginning of the code.   In
    most cases this is an XOR loop.  It will look something like this...
            
    add si, [1234]    ;
    mov di, si        ;
    mov cx, 0123      ; this would be the virus size to unencrypt
 *  mov al, [0105]    ; this is the encryption value's offset or the
                      ; actual encryption value if no brackets are
                      ; around it
    cli               ; auto increment
    lodsb             ; load byte from si position
    xor ah, al        ; xor byte at si
    stosb             ; store it a di (same as si)
    loop 0110         ; loop until cx=0 NOTE: 0110 will be an offset
    ret               ; return when done

    Where the "*" is, will be either the location of the encryption
    value, or the actual encryption value if no brackets are around it.
    If there are no brackets, keep that number in mind.  Otherwise write
    the offset down.

    Step Five
    ---------

    When the encryption procedure is done the virus is then unencrypted.
    If you were to write the virus to disk now, it would not run.  Cause
    as soon as the virus runs it encrypts itself and then jumps into the
    encrypted code.

    Follow the program to the part where the virus is about to write the
    virus to the host program.  It will again call on the encryption
    routine.

  * Here it is again, but this time, before it XORs anything load the
    encryption value with 0's.  If it is a bytes value load it with 00,
    if it is a word value load it with 0000 as in...

    
    add si, [1234]    ;
    mov di, si        ;
    mov cx, 0123      ; this would be the virus size to unencrypt
  * mov al, 00        ; change the encryption value to zero, thus the
                      ; encryption will not take place at all.  Instead
                      ; the virus will produce an original strain.
    cli               ; auto increment
    lodsb             ; load byte from si position
    xor ah, al        ; xor byte at si
    stosb             ; store it a di (same as si)
    loop 0110         ; loop until cx=0 NOTE: 0110 will be an offset
    ret               ; return when done

    Now run the program at full speed.  The next file the virus infects
    will be unencrypted, and executable.

    NOTE: This method will work only for the types of viruses that use
    this type of encryption.  Mainly non-resident .COM and .EXE
    infectors.  In other words, don't go thinking this trick will work
    on Whale or anything.

40Hex Issue 4                                            December 1991

                            Is This The End?
                            ----------------

   Well, to be honest.  I'm kind of tired writing this magazine.  It's
   not like I hate it or anything, it's just too much pressure for one
   person to handle.  Decimator helped me out a bit with a few articals
   and such.  But still every time I do an issue it's me who does the
   marjority of the work.  It seems the magazine is bigger than I
   thought.  It seems to be on everybodys BBS from NY to California,
   from Canada to Europe.  The thing is I can't write this thing by
   myself anymore.  I work everyday from 2pm - 10pm and I will be going
   back to school next semester.  So I don't have time to handle all the
   things I do.  So in the long run the magazine suffers.  Anyway,
   unless people want to help out (mabey the reason is that I haven't
   really asked before) lemme know.  Contact me on Digital Warefare.
   The numbers in an artical in this issue somewhere I'm sure.  Anyway,
   fuck it, If people don't contribute soon this may well be the last
   issue of this rag ever.  So whatever happens in 1992, we shall see.
   So if this is it, later people.  My viruses will still be coming on
   strong as always...

   Later
