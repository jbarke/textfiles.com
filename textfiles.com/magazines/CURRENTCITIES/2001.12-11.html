   Ciccone, Karen, editor. [8]"Virtual Reference: Today and Tomorrow
   [9]Information Technology & Libraries 20(3) (September 2001)
   (http://www.lita.org/ital/ital2003.html). - In this theme issue of
   ITAL, the emerging field of network-based library reference service is
   covered. Most of the articles are descriptions of specific projects
   and their experiences forging new paths in providing real-time patron
   assistance remotely. In addition to case studies, one piece describes
   the different roles in digital reference transactions, and another
   identifies desired enhancements to software that supports virtual
   reference encounters. Given the very early stage in developing
   network-based reference services, this theme issue is a welcome
   addition to the growing literature on this topic. - [10]RT
   
   Ditlea, Steve [11]"The Electronic Paper Chase" [12]Scientific American
   285(5) (November 2001)
   (http://www.sciam.com/2001/1101issue/1101ditlea.html). - We are
   witness to a persistent dichotomy -- the vision and the reality -- in
   the diffusion of information. There is the proliferation of computing
   devices, huge propagation of digitized data, and the promise of a
   paperless society. Ironically the reality has been a veritable
   explosion of published paper, primarily because it is accessible,
   convenient and easy to use. Based on future e-paper, this is about to
   change. In presenting an overview of two competing technologies, Steve
   Diltea recounts the story of two visionaries, who for three decades,
   albeit sporadically, have been developing technologies that aim to
   replace conventional ink-on-paper with paper-like electronic displays.
   The main advantage touted, is that these devices can be erased and
   reused. The two scientists are Nicholas K. Sheridon, working at XEROX
   Palo Alto Research Park (PARC), and Joseph Jacobson of the MIT Media
   Lab. Each of these organizations has spun off startup companies,
   Gyricon Media in Palo Alto CA, and E Ink Corporation in Cambridge, MA,
   respectively. Gyrocon's process employs microscopic two-tone plastic
   beads, rotated by an electrical charge to produce either white or
   black dots onto the viewing plane, thus producing lettering.
   Jacobson's process uses transparent polymer microcapsules containing a
   blue liquid dye along with white particles. Depending on the
   electrical charge images can be produced on a white background, or
   reversed onto a dark background. Both technologies have been test
   implemented in retail establishments. The article concludes with
   several related links: Information about Electronic Reusable Paper is

   Gordon, Rachel Singer. "A Course in Accidental Systems Librarianship"
   [18]Computers in Libraries 21(10) (Nov/Dec 2001): 24-28. - The first
   generation is always such an ad hoc situation. Ford got his automotive
   smarts, at least initially, while still down on the farm. The Wright
   Brothers had their bicycle shop. Afterwards, the specialization and
   degrees come but until then, trailblazers are pretty much on their
   own. There is no course of study for becoming a Systems Librarian or
   if there is, the author of this piece, a self-taught systems librarian
   from a suburban library system didn't take it. What she then imagines
   is a series of courses which highlight those characteristics of the
   job which she has found to be important. Included are plentiful
   examples, many of them delightful, from her own experience. - [19]LRK
   
   Guthrie, Kevin M. [20]"Archiving the Digital Age: There's a Will, But
   is There a Way?" [21]EDUCAUSE Review (November/December 2001): 56-65
   (http://www.cause.org/ir/library/pdf/erm0164.pdf). - In this article,
   the President of [22]JSTOR, the initiative to archive e-journals,
   takes on questions of persistence. As he rightly identifies,
   "archiving is not, and never has been, an issue fundamentally about
   technology; rather, it is about organizations and resources." He first
   frames the issue, then uses JSTOR's experience to illustrate some of
   the economic issues of long-term archiving. He concludes by pointing
   out that "local motivations that have been the foundation of the
   current paper archive do not naturally generate the scale of resources
   that will be required to establish the more centralized model
   necessary for the preservation of electronic documents." Nonetheless,
   he points out that since the Internet makes centralized repositories
   easily available to a wide range of institutions, such costs can be
   spread out to such a degree that they can be less expensive and more
   effective than the costs of preserving print material. - [23]RT
   
   Heins, Marjorie and Christina Cho. [24]Internet Filters: A Public
   Policy Report National Coalition Against Censorship (Fall 2001)
   (http://www.ncac.org/issues/internetfilters.html) - In the spring and
   summer of this year, the Free Expression Policy Project of the
   National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) rounded up all the
   studies and tests it could find that described and evaluated 19
   products or services commonly used to filter out "objectionable" Web
   content. This report, intended as a resource for both policymakers and
   the general public, summarizes and expands on what the investigators
   found -- mainly, that nearly every test "revealed massive overblocking
   by filtering software." The main problem, of course, is that the size
   and the ever-changing nature of the Web mandate heavy reliance on
   "mindless mechanical blocking" that checks for certain words and
   phrases while ignoring context. Even worse -- "Where human judgment
   does come into play, filtering decisions are based on different
   companies' broad and varying concepts of offensiveness,
   'inappropriateness' or disagreement with the political viewpoint of
   the manufacturer." The report offers some sad, scary, and downright
   humorous examples of erroneously blocked sites, e.g., "Net Nanny,
   SurfWatch, Cybersitter, and BESS, among other products, blocked House
   Majority Leader Richard 'Dick' Armey's official Website upon detecting
   the word 'dick.'" A bibliography of online and print sources is
   included, as are two appendices: (A) Blocked Sites by Subject:
   Artistic and Literary; Sexuality Education; Gay and Lesbian
   Information; Political Topics/Human Rights; Censorship; and (B)
   Blocking Categories for Different Filters Defined. - [25]SK
   
   Hilton, James. [26]"Copyright Assumptions and Challenges" [27]EDUCAUSE
   Review (November/December 2001): 48-55
   (http://www.cause.org/ir/library/pdf/erm0163.pdf). - In this direct,
   clearly stated piece Hilton slays some common but dead wrong
   assumptions about copyright. Perhaps the biggest of these is the myth
   that "Copyright was created primarily to protect an author's
   intellectual property." As Hilton ponits out, the United States
   Constitution clearly states that the purpose of affording a limited
   set of rights to creators is to "promote the Progress of Science and
   the useful Arts". The primary right afforded creators is a monopoly on
   their work for a limited time that began at fourteen years in early
   legislation, and has steadily increased ever since until we are now
   faced with a monopoly that extends far beyond the life of the author.
   Hilton urges academicians to use and fight for the principle of Fair
   Use as an essential component of copyright law, a cherished liberty,
   and that which underpins the academic enterprise. Without Fair Use, he
   asserts, a number of common academic practices become impossible.
   Hilton makes specific recommendations about what academic institutions
   should do to protect their rights to "promote the Progress of Science
   and the useful Arts". His call to arms comes none too soon, as in this
   "copyright war" we've already lost most of the battles. - [28]RT
   
   Litman, Jessica. Digital Copyright. Amherst, NY: [29]Prometheus Books,
   2001. ISBN: 1-57392-889-5. - The prospect of reading a new book on
   copyright rarely makes the pulse pound with excitement. Rather, in
   spite of the best intentions of authors, the average treatise quickly
   induces a strong desire for a nap. That's too bad. There are few
   topics of more vital importance to information professionals, and, as
   electronic information becomes the headliner in libraries rather than
   the opening act, it will be essential that we become more ardent about
   copyright. If not, the halcyon days of ownership and fair use
   (whatever they were) will fade in the twilight, and, in their place,
   will be the bright new days of negotiated access rights and content in
   encrypted digital "lockboxes" (where have I heard that before?). We'll
   ask questions (Can I view it? Can I store it? Can I print it? Can I
   quote it? How much of it? How long can I do it?) and get answers that
   depend on how fat our wallets are. We'll be amazed at how many
   licensing permutations there can be when publishers can truly control
   access to every byte. Reading Litman's book could help stave off
   information dystopia. With chapters such as "Copyright Lawyers Set Out
   to Colonize Cyberspace" and "Just Say Yes to Licensing!," it's clear
   that this book is more lively and readable than the typical tome.
   Rather than just reciting facts, Litman tries to give the reader a
   feel for the dynamics of copyright politics and the motivations behind
   the whole crazy mess. And, as you might infer from the chapter titles,
   she definitely has a point of view. Quick, read it while it's still in
   print format. - [30]CB
   
   [31]"The New Rules of Engagement" themed issue, [32]Wired 9(12)
   (December 2001) (http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/). - Before
   we get to the meat of this review, a lesson from art history class: in
   tracking cultural changes, watch for the transition from a classical
   to a mannerist style. The former is characterized by a need for
   expression of new ideas finding an effective medium for doing so,
   resulting in works which capture the zeitgeist, while the latter is
   characterized by imitation (executing "in the manner of") which adds
   nothing to, even dilutes, the classical period's accomplishments. This
   kind of change has been happening to Wired, which is turning from a
   unique window on a new world into a kind of style guide: buy this
   stuff and repeat these buzzwords and you can live the Wired life. (I
   propose that the transformation be completed by selling the mag to
   that absolute dictator for lifestyle, Martha Stewart. She recently
   announced that she's going to come out with her own single issue on
   the subject of high tech in the home, so if the response is good this
   could be a branding match made in heaven. Martha Stewart Wired
   Living!) That off my chest, I recommend looking at the December Wired
   if you have a morbid fascination with how info tech publications are
   exploiting our post-Sept. 11 paranoia. Let's face it -- geeks and
   wannabe geeks get a technothrill from topics like surveillance, netwar
   and swarming theory, and can nod knowingly as easy targets like
   cumbersome military apparatus are shot down in print. This issue is
   such a mix of yellow journalism, unworkable schemes and recycled
   notions which long-time Wired readers will recognize, that I'm loathe
   to admit that there are also some intriguing ideas. That, and the fact
   that the mag still has a relatively large readership to influence,
   makes it worth watching, warily. - JR
   
   Olsen, Florence. [33]"Colleges Experiment With Routing On-Campus Phone
   Calls Over the Internet" [34]The Chronicle of Higher Education
   (October 23, 2001)
   (http://www.chronicle.com/free/2001/10/2001102301t.htm) - Using the
   Internet to make phone calls, aka IP telephony, has long been one of
   those "sounds great, works lousy" ideas. It may, however, be finally
   coming into its own. One example discussed in this article is what
   happened after students at Columbia University tried to call friends
   and family in the wake of the September terrorist attacks, but were
   unable to get through because Manhattan's telephone system was
   "overwhelmed." Within hours of the attack, network specialists in the
   university's School of Engineering and Applied Science, managed to set
   up a conference room where students could make calls -- both
   nationally and internationally -- over the Internet. "Specialized
   telephones had been hastily configured to route outbound calls through
   several Internet gateways to the public telephone network." Other
   academic institutions are sticking their toes into the waters of IP
   telephony; some, in fact, are diving in headfirst. The article goes on
   to describe the ins and outs of campuswide IP phone networks,
   advantages and disadvantages, and potential cost savings. - [35]SK
   
   SANS Institute. [36]The Twenty Most Critical Internet Security
   Vulnerabilities (Updated): The Experts' Consensus (November 15, 2001)
   Version 2.501 (http://www.sans.org/top20.htm) - If you had even the
   slightest doubt that the Internet is becoming more, not less, like the
   Wild West, consider that last year's version of this document was
   called "The Ten Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities." At
   the top of this year's list? "Default installs of operating systems
   and applications." Why? Because hackers/crackers are well aware of all
   the unpatched services, open ports, etc. Also included are foibles
   such as bad passwords, incomplete or non-existent backups, logging and
   address filtering failures, vulnerable code (e.g., CGI), buffer
   overflows, and unpatched Swiss Cheese Microsoft products. The
   document, compiled in conjunction with the FBI's National
   Infrastructure Protection Center, is valuable because "the majority of
   successful attacks on computer systems via the Internet can be traced
   to exploitation of security flaws on this list." Note that this is a
   "living document" that "includes step-by-step instructions and
   pointers to additional information useful for correcting the flaws."
   The document is updated and expanded as new information becomes
   available. - [37]SK
   
   Schnapp, Marilyn. [38]"Are Tech Book Sales a Leading Economic
   Indicator?" [39]O' Reilly Network (November 16, 2001)
   (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/webservices/2001/11/16/indicator.html
   ) - The short answer is yes, according to this author, who ran
   O'Reilly's research department in 2000-2001. She compared "sales
   trends of some of O'Reilly & Associates' technical books with other
   economic indicators, including the NASDAQ index." The article includes
   some intriguing charts and graphs which illustrate, for example, that
   sales of O'Reilly tech books at Amazon.com closely track the level of
   the NASDAQ, and that sales of O'Reilly Linux titles at Barnes & Noble
   rise and fall almost in tandum with the price of Red Hat stock. As Hal
   Varian -- Dean of the School of Information Management and Systems,
   University of California, Berkeley -- explains, "(T)he belief that IT
   was going to be a very profitable investment...drove investor behavior
   in the stock market and knowledge workers' investment in technical
   books." The findings discussed in this article, says the author,
   "suggests that segmenting book sales data along economic sectors might
   be useful in gauging future economic downturns of other sectors of the
   economy." - [40]SK
   
   Simons, Barbara. "Viewpoint: The ACM Declaration in Felten v. RIAA".
   [41]Communications of the ACM 44(10) (Oct. 2001): 23-26. - This is the
   FAQ explaining ACM's decision to submit a declaration in support of
   the litigants in the Felten case. Questions are asked and answered in
   a sober manner and range from background information to what ACM hopes
   to achieve through its action. At the very least, one suspects, ACM is
   out to avoid the nightmare scenario where, in the words of this
   article, it will need to "hire attorneys to review conference and
   journal submissions that could possibly be in violation of the
   anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA." [42]Text of the declaration
   itself can found at the ACM site at
   http://www.acm.org/usacm/copyright/felten_declaration.html. [Addendum:
   CNET reports that the judge has dismissed the case. The judge's ruling
   is not yet available.
