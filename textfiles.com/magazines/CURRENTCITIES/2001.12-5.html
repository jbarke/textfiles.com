   - Less than flattering appraisal of the new French National Library
   condemned for everything from being too colossal to being in the wrong
   part of Paris. "...A library is its collections," says one critic
   intimating that perhaps French officials got their priorities wrong. A
   library is also the people it serves and apparently the planners got
   that wrong as well. - [12]LRK
   
   Baker, Nicholson. Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper New
   York: Random House, 2001. - Those of you familiar with Nicholson
   Baker's previous diatribes against libraries jettisoning the card
   catalog in favor of automated library systems will not be surprised by
   this book. Only now his jeremiad is about how libraries and archives
   microfilmed newspapers and then discarded or pulped the originals. We
   can take Baker to task for some of his conclusions, intimations of
   conspiracy, and illusions of bad intent, but at their root the facts
   are difficult to dispute. Libraries did microfilm newspapers, and they
   did throw away the originals. Libraries must look carefully at the
   actions of the past and consider their ramifications regarding their
   collections now and in the future -- particularly as digitization
   takes hold in many institutions. Unfortunately, calm consideration of
   the issues is difficult when the depictions and descriptions he uses
   are meant to inflame more than inform, and to advocate rather than
   enlighten. His audience is the general public, and in trying to hold
   their attention he tends toward hyperbole and theatrical tricks, when
   libraries are all just trying to do the best they can for their
   particular audiences, given the resources they're given to do it. -

   Black, Alistair and Rodney Brunt, [14]"MI5, 1909-1946: An Information
   Management Perspective" Journal of Information Science 26(3) (2000):
   185-197.
   (http://www.thenutshell.co.uk/content/secure/E-Journals/PDFs/ji260308.
   pdf); Newman, Niles C., Alan L. Porter and Julie Yang, "Information
   Professionals: Changing Tools, Changing Roles" [15]Information Outlook
   (March 200): 24. - In judging the titles, one could assume that these
   two articles are disparate, in sharp contrast,  and even
   contradictory. Black and Brunt of Leeds Metropolitan University, U.K.,
   present the foibles and pitfalls of information management in the slow
   paced past, while Newman et. al.  attempt to forecast future
   information management practices, within the context of rapid change.
   They state that the information professional may become intimidated
   and feel threatened. The common theme which permeates both articles is
   the value and importance of effective information management. As such,
   those managing information must combine several key skills: 1.
   negotiate exponential growth and increased demand, 2. provide value
   added interpretation and analysis of data, and 3. communicate these in
   a timely manner. All of the preceding are pivotal to the
   decision-making process. As we are in the present, positioned between
   the past and a rapidly changing future, it is reassuring, validating,
   and even comforting to know that these challenges are neither novel,
   nor radical. Information management techniques and practices may be
   evolving, but are an intrinsic component of the continuum of the
   intelligent decision process. As technology evolves, we are not
   reinventing the wheel, just improving it. MI5 is Britain's leading
   counter-intelligence agency. Shortly after its inception in 1909, it
   became evident that in order to succeed in its mission, the
   establishment of an efficient system for information gathering,
   storage, retrieval, analysis, and interpretation was paramount. Using
   recently declassified documents in the Public Record Office, Black and
   Brunt demonstrate that the value of information management was
   recognized long before the advent of the computer. In tracing the
   history, they note that despite the critical value of information,
   there were times when it was allowed to degrade. The hierarchy of
   priorities was determined largely by the inward focus of MI5's
   charismatic leaders. Thus the quality and timeliness of intelligence
   information deteriorated between world wars. Lacking evidence to the
   contrary, the authors conclude that the degradation resulted from an
   absence of information management practice based on widely accepted
   business and library science standards. During the second world war,
   needs dictated that information management, integral to decision
   making, be once again accorded primacy. Black and Brunt's article does
   not read like a cloak and dagger novella. Rather it is a scholarly
   study of the benefits of systematic information management within an
   organization, albeit one dealing with espionage. Newman et. al.
   propose that the convergence of new technologies will radically alter
   the role of information professionals. The information professional's
   principle objectives are the management and rapid distillation of
   information to reinforce the decision making process. Information
   management will assume a new dimension as new skills are acquired, and
   new intelligent tools are utilized. The authors present four trends,
   the drivers behind each trend, as well as how these will impact the
   information professionals' skills and roles. After reading both
   articles,  it becomes clear that expert tools, research profiles,
   scripts and macros are indeed propelled by new technology. The
   practical aims of information management, however, remain constant. -

   When considering weak links in the chain of distribution for online
   media it's rare that 20 inch monitors are singled out as inadequate
   but that's precisely what the authors in this article do. The problem
   as they see it is that even a 20 inch monitor will hardly do justice
   to objects -- say, the ceiling-scraping David by Michelangelo -- which
   are far larger. Their solution is to run a string of inexpensive
   projectors in parallel against a large wall in a vision of "immersive"
   displays which currently may only be available at planetariums or IMAX
   cinemas. - [18]LRK

   (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2001071). - This
   study of internet access in U.S. public schools finds that "almost
   all" schools now have access to the net. Access has gone from 35% to
   98% in the period 1994-2000. Access is not equal for all types of
   schools -- the study points to disparities based on income and race
   though there are improvements here as well. The study also looks at
   the type of connection and connection speed, hours of availability and
   methods used to prevent student access to inappropriate material. -

   Cover, Robin. [21]SGML/XML Bibliography
   (http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/biblio.html). - There's a reason why
   I don't provide extensive coverage of SGML/XML and related topics in
   my [22]Scholarly Electronic Publishing Bibliography. I admit it: I
   don't want to compete with Robin Cover, author of the frequently
   updated and all-inclusive SGML/XML Bibliography. This annotated
   bibliography is definitely the place to go if you want in-depth
   information about these key standards, complete with links to the
   literature (if available) and related links. Yeah, it would be nice if
   the newer updates to the bibliography about XML were integrated into
   the base document, which has references to over 2,000 works as of
   1998. But, given the amount of work that has gone into this document,
   who can really complain? Did I mention that the bibliography is only a
   part of a much bigger Web site called [23]The XML Cover Pages
   (http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html), edited by Cover? Want
   news, overviews, archive sites, publications, user groups, event
   listings, mailing lists, software tools and much more about an
   alphabet soup of markup language standards? You got it. Give yourself

   (February 2001)
   (http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v01/i08/Cranefield/). - This
   article describes how UML (Universal Modeling Language) can be used to
   encode the "knowledge" represented by Web pages. It does this by
   describing the strengths and weaknesses of UML and [27]RDF (Resource
   Discovery Framework), and then describes an online process for
   exchanging the two through XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
   Transformations). Cranefield notes the process is not perfect. The
   term "knowledge" is used in a philosophically very informal way, but
   the text demonstrates how information can easily be converted from one
   format to another for the purposes of extracting and possibly
   representing meaning. - [28]ELM
   
   Fox, Edward A. and Gary Marchioni, guest editors. "Digital Libraries"
   [29]Communications of the ACM 44(5) (May 2001): 31-68. - This
   collection of articles, short pieces, and sidebars continues CACM's
   tradition of revisiting digital library research on a periodic basis
   by devoting the bulk of an issue to the topic. As usual, it is a bit
   of a mixed bag, but nearly all the pieces are devoted to the findings
   of DL research -- research that may never result in actual,
   functioning digital library services. A stand-out in this crowd is the
   piece from the Perseus Project ("Drudgery and Deep Thought"), which is
   not only tackling infrastructure issues but is also a destination that
   has a large amount of interesting content. A short piece from
   Christine Borgman reminding everyone that library services from human
   beings are still needed in this brave new world, and another from the
   New Zealand Digital Library on their Greenstone software that they are
   using to provide access to a large collection of content, are worth
   the few minutes required to read them. Another short piece is cited
   elsewhere in this issue of Current Cites. - [30]RT
   
   Glanz, James. "The World of Science Becomes a Global Village: Archive
   Opens a New Realm of Research." [31]The New York Times (May 1, 2001).
   - Founded more than 10 years ago by physicist Paul Ginsparg, the
   [32]web-based archive at Los Alamos National Labs (http://arXiv.org/,
   known variously as the Los Alamos pre-print server, electronic archive
   or database of physics papers and, quaintly, the Los Alamos electronic
   bulletin board) no longer qualifies as breaking news in the world of
   information technology. This article focuses on how the archive has
   changed physics by encouraging multinational collaboration and erasing
   geopolitical boundaries. Researchers in resource-poor institutions now
   have free access to the latest reports in their field. At the same
   time, a physicist from, say, a small research institute outside of
   Tehran can engage in scientific dialogue with researchers from major
   institutions in the US and Europe. - [33]MP

   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_4/rennels/). - In 1998, the
   Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) University
   Library received a grant from the Institute of Museums and Libraries
   (IMLS) to study the uses of digital technology in art education. As
   part of the program, twelve teachers became part of a pilot program to
   integrate digital resources into a classroom teaching environment.
   This article describes their experience, and the graphic elements the
   authors include capture the delight of introducing art to children and
   seeing what they create. It also sounds a promising note for
   successful implementations of digital technology in the classroom,
   which is notoriously unforgiving on hardware, software and curriculum
   planners. - [36]TH

   Information 1(8) (February 2001)
   (http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v01/i08/Hunter/). - Mapping
   terminology and cross-walks are all the rage when it comes to
   gathering and homogenizing sets of XML data. The problems of mapping
   (exact matches and semantic mappings) are articulated, and the use of
   a thesaurus -- MetaNet -- is posited as an alternative solution.
   Instead of "hardwiring" ontologies between data, terms looked up in a
   thesaurus with the usual characteristics in order to build mappings
   and crosswalks. This is interesting because what is old is new again;
   take note of how a age-old library tool is being used in a new
   environment. - [38]ELM

   This article describes a simple [41]Open Archives Initiative
   repository tool called [42]Kepler. By using this application
   individual researchers can participate in the OAI with a minimum of
   effort. Kepler is a bit different from other OAI repository tools.
   First, it uses a file system to store its data, not a database.
   Second, and more importantly, Kepler works in conjunction with a
   "registration" server. This registration server is modeled on the idea
   of peer-to-peer networking schemes such as Napster. If used in the way
   it was designed, Kepler can facilitate wide-scale dissemination of
   scholarly papers and information. No fuss. No muss. - [43]ELM

   Review 104 (March 2001): 42-48
   (http://www.technologyreview.com/magazine/mar01/mann.asp) - The
   problem with current e-book readers is that they are not books. It's
   hard to read text on those little screens, especially in strong light,
   and you lose the navigation capabilities, broader context, and
   mnemonic qualities that flipping pages provides. Sure you can do neat
   stuff like searching, but what are you going to take to the beach?
   Enter e-paper--flexible plastic sheets that conduct electricity and
   are stamped with circuits that control a layer of e-ink to create
   black-and-white characters and images. In the future, take a few
   hundred sheets of e-paper and add a hard cover plus an electronic
   spine crammed with a cpu, a storage device, and a wireless board.
   Result: an e-book that looks like a book and works like a book, but
   stores countless works and supports searching, linking, and dynamic
   updating via the Internet. How far in the future? Maybe a few years,
   maybe a decade. Still, this is a technology to keep an eye on. -

   various functions of the local school system. Ellis recalls the
   vision, widely held at the time, that not only was the computer going
   to speed things up but that it would allow us -- nay, require us -- to
   rethink much of what we do. "Thinking about computers in education
   does not mean thinking about computers," Ellis says quoting himself

   [53]NetConnect A supplement to Library Journal and School Library
   Journal (Spring 2001): 12-15
   (http://www.libraryjournal.com/digital_preservation.asp). - In his
   usual interesting and highly-readable style, Wiggins takes on a
   familiar topic but brings a new perspective. Citing the overnight
   disappearance of a large collection of government content during the
   recent presidential transition (at least some of which may yet become
   available again, albeit in a different place), Wiggins outlines modes
   of "digital death" (let me count the ways...), or the ways in which
   digital information can disappear. There are many, and they lean
   toward the mundane and trivial (e.g., the information provider loses
   interest) rather than the dramatic (e.g., disaster). If digital data
   goes into that dark night, he seems to assert, it will mostly go
   quietly. A sidebar on the ironic disappearance of an archive that set
   out to preserve digital serials provides a tragic example of how
   commitment means almost everything in digital preservation, with any
   other issue being a far, far distant second. - [54]RT

   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_4/wilhelm/). - This is the
   keynote address of "Web-Wise: The Second Annual Conference on
   Libraries and Museums in the Digital World", and the author uses his
   pulpit to speak earnestly about the vital roles that information
   professionals play in bridging the digital divide. He identifies four
   attributes of the digital divide -- literacy, access, content and
   training -- and explores the record of libraries and museums in
   addressing the ongoing challenge of meeting end users on their own
   terms. It will not come as a surprise to public service providers that
   he builds a strong case for the importance of "people"
   skills-emphasizing human interaction alongside technology. He argues
   that a personal touch is all the more needed to move the truly
   disadvantaged into the digital arena. - [57]TH
