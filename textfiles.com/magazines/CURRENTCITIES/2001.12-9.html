   [9]Attributes of a Trusted Digital Repository: Meeting the Needs of
   Research Resources
   Mountain View, CA: Research Libraries Group, August 2001: 52p
   (http://www.rlg.org/longterm/attributes01.pdf). - Building on the
   foundation of the seminal report [10]Preserving Digital Information:
   Report of the Task Force on Archiving of Digital Information, this
   paper seeks to define trusted digital repositories, identify their
   primary attributes, devise a framework for certifying repositories as
   trustworthy, identify the responsibilities of an archive compliant
   with the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model, and
   make recommendations for further work in this area. If this sounds
   like a daunting task, that's because it is. But the blue-ribbon group
   that wrote this paper is up to the challenge. The paper lays out the
   following attributes of a trusted digital repository: administrative
   responsibility, organizational viability, financial sustainability,
   technological suitability, system security, and procedural
   accountability. In each of these areas specific traits are identified
   that should be present in a trusted repository. The paper also
   discusses types of certification and processes by which certification
   may be revoked. This is a policy document, not a technical
   explication, and therefore a discussion of the OAIS reference model
   can be found in an appendix, as can a glossary of terms. This document
   is an important next step down the road leading to an effective
   digital preservation strategy. - [11]RT
   
   Bonett, Monica [12]"Personalization of Web Services: Opportunities and
   Challenges" [13]Ariadne Issue 28 (2001)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/personalization/). - In the last
   decade, we have witnessed the evolution of the World Wide Web, leading
   us from static pages, to interactive pages offering search and
   retrieval capabilities. The next level, to further engage the user, is
   that of customization and personalization. This article organized in
   four parts, begins by posing the question "Will personalised service
   become part of users' standard definition of good service?" To provide
   some answers, the author defines personalized service, drawing the
   distinction between personalization and customization.  The latter is
   primarily user driven. This means that the user actively configures
   his web interface, creates a profile, and explicitly controls the
   content received. Conversely, personalization does not actively
   solicit user input. The user remains passive. Rather, the web content
   reacts to the known behaviour of the user or of a like-minded user
   group. Preferences are monitored, gauged, analyzed. These findings
   then result in catered content without active user contribution.
   Examples of customized content are [14]My Yahoo, and television
   listing services offering what the user has requested. Personalization
   features are exemplified by [15]Staples and [16]Amazon. Section 2
   examines the enabling technologies of customization and
   personalization. These include "fill-in profiles", "click-stream
   analysis" or web usage mining systems, collaborative filtering and
   cookies. Examples from the educational sector, most notably
   [17]MyLibrary at North Carolina State University Libraries are offered
   in the third section. The last section looks at challenges in
   establishing user needs, usability, i.e. good web design practices,
   ethics and privacy, building relationships and measuring success. The
   article concludes with a webliography of cited sites. For those of us
   involved in website management, this is a comprehensive treatment of
   both the potential and the caveats of tailoring sites to individual
   requirements. - [18]MG
   
   Bruno, Lee [19]"Assessing the Net's Structural Integrity" [20]Red
   Herring (September 5, 2001)
   (http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=special_report_gen&doc_id=
   960020 096). - Though the Internet has grown exponentially over the
   past decade, it is still in a relatively early phase of its own
   evolution. Inevitably, new hardware and software upgrades to the
   Internet backbone will be ongoing over the next several years. However
   the listless economy almost certainly means less spending by network
   carriers. What spending there is will likely be centered on optical
   components that are compatible with "the ubiquitous ethernet
   standard." The package of stories in this special report examines the
   popularity of ethernet, the new IPv6 protocol that will succeed TCI/IP
   (now 20 years old!), and the Internet's huge core routers -- "the
   equivalent of post office mail-sorting centers" -- that move zillions
   of bits of data around the world 24/7. Also included are some brief
   profiles of key companies and related "whispers" from the venture
   capital community. - [21]SK
   
   Doctorow, Cory. [22]"Metacrap: Putting the Torch to Seven Straw-Men of
   the Meta-Utopia". (Version 1.3) (August 26, 2001)
   (http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm) - 'Why Johnny Can't
   Catalog' might be a more appropriate title for this strongly argued
   yet brief piece. Doctorow casts doubt on the ability (or even
   willingness of Joe Six-Pack content-creator to properly and honestly
   identify his online material. Librarians will be familiar with many of
   the author's complaints. - [23]LRK
   
   Eick, Stephen G. "Visualizing Online Activity" [24]Communications of
   the ACM 44(8) (August 2001) pp. 45-50. - Graphic representations of
   Web site structure and traffic can be useful when the site is quite
   complex, and/or there is a large amount of usage data gathered - which
   often go hand in hand. The author, CTO of a business which sells
   information visualization tools, examines problems that can be solved
   this way and the types of software (his own and others) that can do
   the job. He focuses on three such applications of visual aids: for
   users navigating a site, for site managers tracking user paths and
   flows, and for monitoring real-time site activity. He describes
   variations on the standard tree scheme such as hyperbolic trees, and
   other methods like 3D landscape representations, weaving in relevant
   consideration of things like scalability, user manipulability and
   screen display limitations. - JR
   
   Ellison, Craig [25]"Exploiting and Protecting 802.11b Wireless
   Networks" [26]ExtremeTech (September 4, 2001)
   (http://www.extremetech.com/article/0,3396,s%253D1024%2526a%253D13880,
   00.asp ). - That new wireless LAN in your building is just the coolest
   thing, is it not? Unfortunately, many wireless networks that use the
   IEEE 802.11b standard are as leaky as decrepit old rowboats. The boom
   in 802.11b networks is largely due to WECA, the Wireless Ethernet
   Compatibility Alliance, which developed an interoperability standard
   called WI-FI (wireless fidelity). In order for a vendor's wireless
   networking products to sport the WI-FI logo, these items must pass
   some basic interoperability tests. While this has had the effect of
   making wireless networks easy to install and use, security issues have
   been pretty much ignored. In this article, a team of "war drivers"
   goes cruising around Manhattan, Jersey City and Silicon Valley using a
   laptop, a wireless LAN card, antennas and a "sniffer" program called
   NetStumbler. They discover firsthand -- by tapping in -- just how many
   insecure wireless networks are out there. Fortunately, the article
   provides advice and links to more information about protecting and
   securing those leaky 802.11b networks. If you're even marginally
   responsible for one of these things, this article is a must-read. -

   Foster, Andrea L. "Libraries Criticize Federal Report on
   Digital-Copyright Law." [28]The Chronicle of Higher Education 48(3)
   (September 14, 2001): A39. - A US Coypright Office report
   ([29]http://www.loc.gov/copyright/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_study.html
   ) on the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act has come under fire by
   library advocates including the American Library Association. Congress
   required the Copyright Office to issue the report so that they as
   lawmakers can decide if there are flaws in the digital copyright law
   that need fixing. Critics argue that the report should have provided
   greater assurances to libraries and consumers on the rights to lend
   and archive digital materials. - [30]MP

   Mundane". [32]New York Times (August 26, 2001)
   (http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/technology/26ONLI.html). - The
   author explores a number of interesting issues all tied around the
   apparent phenomenon that people are visiting fewer sites nowadays. A
   typical user "knows what he wants and he mostly knows where to get
   it." This leads to a consolidation of sites garnering most of the
   traffic and, ultimately, to a less culturally diversified web. Does
   this point to the end of web surfing as we know it? The jury,
   thankfully, is still out. - [33]LRK

   Resources, 2001. ISBN 1-887334-84-X.
   (http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub99/pub99.pdf). - With a focus on
   the practices of [36]Digital Library Federation members, Timothy
   Jewell investigates how research libraries select, finance, license,
   provide access to, support, and track the use of commercial electronic
   resources. Special attention is paid to consortial purchasing
   arrangements and emerging systems for managing electronic resources
   (Appendix B provides details about the functions and data elements of
   existing or planned systems at selected libraries). Suggested
   electronic resources practices are identified in the conclusion.
   Appendix A provides links to relevant supporting documents and Web
   pages for the major sections of the report. - [37]CB
   
   Lewis, Geoff. "Metaphorical Mayhem" [38]Brill's Content (Fall 2001)
   pp. 65-69. - Are you, too, responsible for the dotcom collapse? The
   author, tongue in cheek, takes responsibility because (like so many of
   us who've written about the Internet) he chose metaphors which quickly
   acquired verisimilitude and helped raise expectations beyond any
   reasonable level. Business writer Lewis confesses that, in his efforts
   to clarify a complex situation, he relied upon certain catchphrases
   which you just might recognize. He neatly includes four such gems in
   one sentence: "In the Internet 'gold rush,' a company had to move at
   'Internet speed' to secure 'first-mover advantage' in its corner of
   the 'new economy.'" This is a rueful lesson in how "years of
   hyperbolic one-upmanship" encouraged the kind of wishful thinking that
   left common sense behind in the dust of the old new fronti -- oh,
   sorry. - JR
   
   Lynch, Clifford A. [39]"Metadata Harvesting and the Open Archives
   Initiative" [40]ARL Bimonthly Report 217 (August 2001)
   (http://www.arl.org/newsltr/217/mhp.html). - We have reported on the
   [41]Open Archives Initiative in [42]previous issues of Current Cites.
   In this piece, Lynch focuses on the OAI mechanism for harvesting
   metadata from OAI-compliant archives to create centralized search
   services, the Open Archives Metadata Harvesting Protocol. His overview
   is purposefully non-technical, since those wishing more technical
   information can find such on the Open Archives web site. Rather, Lynch
   provides an excellent and thorough high-level view of how it came
   about, how it operates, possible uses of it, remaining issues, and
   future directions. Thankfully this article is freely available online,
   since many more people than would normally read the ARL Bimonthly
   Report should read this very informative piece on a new technology
   that is like to be very useful to a large variety of digital library
   services. - [43]RT
   
   Manuel, Kate. "Teaching an Online Information Literacy Course."
   [44]Reference Services Review 29(3) (2001): 219-228. - Honest
   appraisal of a distance education initiative that didn't live up to
   expectations. The experiment here was teaching information literacy at
   CSU Hayward to a class of 13 distance learners, only two of whom
   eventually finished on time. The author doesn't flinch from cataloging
   a whole slew of problems. These range from difficulties that students
   had with the medium to questions of whether the medium itself was
   appropriate given the student demographic and subject. The author
   concludes that at least in this instance, "the medium interfered with
   the message". - [45]LRK
   
   Peterson, Karrie, Elizabeth Cowell, and Jim Jacobs. "Government
   Documents at the Crossroads" [46]American Libraries 32(8) (September
   2001): 52-55. - Peterson, et.al. sound a warning that the massive move
   by the U.S. government from the distribution of print documents to
   electronic publication carries with it serious dangers. In the past,
   the federal government distributed paper copies of government
   publication to 1,350 libraries for free. But the Government Printing
   Office recently decided to save money by stopping the print
   distribution of most government documents in favor of electronic
   publication on the web. Although there are benefits to such a move,
   the authors point out problems as well, among them: when government
   servers go down, the documents are completely inaccessible; when the
   government controls the only authentic copy of a document, there is
   nothing to prevent tampering with it; and who will enforce the
   preservation of documents an agency decides to remove from its web
   site? Underlying these issues is an even more important one -- we are
   moving from a society that has possession and control over government
   information to one in which the government solely controls it. Is this
   in the best long-term interests of a free and democratic society?
   Although Peterson, et.al. argue persuasively that librarians must be
   involved in helping to shape federal policy on the publication and
   distribution of government information, they unfortunately do not
   suggest a specific solution. I would have found it instructive, for
   example, to know what problems prevent libraries from offering to
   support an electronic depository program, wherein electronic copies of
   government documents are deposited with numerous libraries upon
   publication, as they were in the print program. - [47]RT
   
   Pitschmann, Louis A. [48]Building Sustainable Collections of Free
   Third-Party Web Resources Washington, DC: Digital Library Federation,
   Council on Library and Information Resources, June 2001, 44p. ISBN
   1-887334-83-1 (http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub98abst.html). - As
   Pitschmann states in the introduction, "the purpose of this report is
   to identify and synthesize existing practices used in developing
   collections of free third-party Internet resources that support higher
   education and research." And an admirable job of it he does. He covers
   identification, evaluation, selection, access, management,
   multilinguality, user support, organizational, and financial issues.
   After several years of creating subject gateways to Internet
   resources, various projects have gained sufficient experience that
   this synthesis from the DLF and CLIR is both welcome and timely. -
