   Allen, Maryellen. "A Case Study of the Usability Testing of the
   University of South Florida's Virtual Library Interface Design"
   [9]Online Information Review 26(1) (2002): 40-53. - This month's
   addition to the growing literature on usability in libraries concerns
   the trials and tribulations of a Web site redesign at University of
   South Florida Libraries. Both successes and failures are reported as
   the development team refines their testing procedures. Anyone who's
   been through the process of reconciling often highly contradictory
   goals will know how rocky a road a site redesign can be. Hints of
   differences in the literature not only make for interesting reading
   but they also helpfully alert us to challenges we too are likely to
   face when going down the same road. Here the problem was whether to
   use "plain, straightforward language" or "library jargon". Apparently
   library jargon won out. - [10]LRK
   
   Anhang, Abe and Steve Coffman. "The Great Reference Debate"
   [11]American Libraries 33(3) (March 2002): 50-54. - The debate of the
   title is based on the proposition "Be it reolved that reference
   librarians are toast." The authors debated this issue at the Ontario
   Library Association Super Conference in Toronto in February 2001, of
   which this article is a summary. Abe Anhang debates for the
   proposition, while Coffman debates against. As it turns out, they both
   believe that reference librarians "as we know them -- ...who sit
   behind desks for five or six hours a day...waiting for people to walk
   up and ask questions" are toast. If you ignore the non-debate,
   Coffman's part does a good job of identifying six reasons why
   reference librarians definitely are not toast -- as long as we can
   meet our users where and when they want to be served. - [12]RT

   Library at SUNY Brockport when a system glitch vaporizes all the MARC
   records from their bib catalog. Backup was faulty and all they had to
   fall back on was a data-run they had submitted five months earlier to
   an outside organization for the purposes of producing a union catalog.
   The public service message coming out of this article is emphasized
   repeatedly by the authors: communicate with your vendor to make sure
   that effective backup procedures are in place and back up early and
   often. - [14]LRK

   Could Turn Them into Big Brother" [15]Chronicle of Higher Education
   48(25) (March 1, 2002): A31-A32. - Let's take a break from topics like
   the Dublin Core, metadata and XML and consider privacy and
   anti-terrorism in the information age. In October, the USA Patriot Act
   was enacted giving law enforcement extra tools to track suspected
   terrorists including the right to open student computer files or,
   potentially, to see student library records. This kind of invasion of
   privacy, some believe, endangers the "climate of free inquiry"
   traditional to the academic environment. Some universities have
   instituted guidelines for responding to law enforcement requests made
   under the new law. At Cornell, if a staff member is asked by a law
   enforcement agent to disclose information about a student, they should
   first contact the information technology policy advisor who will
   consult with the university's lawyers. In resonse to the Patriot Act,
   the library community with ALA and other library administrators at the
   healm, remains steadfast in its advocacy of privacy rights. - [16]MP
   
   Ellis, John. [17]"All the News That's Fit to Blog" [18]Fast Company
   (April 2002) (http://www.fastcompany.com/online/57/jellis.html). -
   Weblogs are hot, hot, hot. One can only wonder if the enthusiasm for
   them will wane now that they are becoming a mainstream phenomenon. In
   this article, Ellis points out the shortcomings of the "boring
   pundits" who dominate newspaper op-ed pages and political talk shows,
   and compares them (unfavorably, of course) to the lively new world of
   weblogs. Not surprisingly, an increasing number of pundits are taking
   up blogging themselves -- i.e., [19]Andrew Sullivan
   (http://www.andrewsullivan.com/), [20]Virginia Postrel
   (http://www.dynamist.com/scene.html), and [21]Mickey Kaus
   (http://www.kausfiles.com/). There are any number of free tools that
   allow anyone to set up a weblog and begin publishing immediately,
   which naturally results in a lot of swill, but also generates a
   surprising amount of eloquent, dynamic discourse. Bloggers, says
   Ellis, "assume that their readers are as smart as they are, if not
   smarter." And rather than trying to keep you at their site by any
   means necessary, they routinely send you out across the Web by posting
   links from diverse and often obscure sources. The underlying
   technology -- and philosophy -- is peer-to-peer. - [22]SK
   
   Emery, David. [23]"The Nigerian E-Mail Hoax: West African Scammers
   Take to the Net" [24]SFGate (March 14, 2002)
   (http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/03/
   14/nig erscam.DTL) - Probably you've already gotten one (or
   more...many more) of these e-mails, ostensibly from some high official
   in the government of Nigeria, Ghana or another West African country.
   This individual urgently seeks your help in transferring a large chunk
   of the national treasury or whatever into a U.S. bank account. All you
   have to do is send this person your bank account number so he or she
   can transfer the money, and he or she will reward your kindness with
   an attractive percentage. Amazingly, people keep falling for
   variations of this scam; the Secret Service says one percent of the
   people thus solicited will respond, and the U.S. Postal Service
   estimates losses to American citizens of more than $100 million
   annually. Who are these pigeons? "Greed and gullibility obviously
   figure in," as do personality traits like risk-taking, susceptibility
   to flattery or intimidation, and lack of interest in news/current
   events. As you might suspect, the Internet has served as a fertile
   breeding ground for scams of this nature. According to the website
   Internet Fraud Watch (http://www.fraud.org/), "Nigerian Money Offers"
   -- also called "Nigerian Advance-Fee Fraud" or "419 Scam" ("419" being
   the relevant section of the country's criminal code) -- surged up the
   charts last year, from seventh to third place, on the list of the most
   common types of online fraud. Next time you receive one of these
   e-mails, forward it to the Secret Service for inclusion in their
   database: [25]419.fcd@usss.treas.gov. - [26]SK

   Scholarly Publishing via the Internet: The Guild Model. CSI Working
   Paper No. WP-02-01.
   (http://www.slis.indiana.edu/csi/WP/WP02-01B.html). - Kling et al.
   suggest that too little attention has been paid to the working papers
   and technical reports of academic departments (and other research
   units) as a model of free scholarly publishing. The "Guild Model"
   relies on the academic reputation of the sponsoring department to
   establish the reputation of its research manuscript archive. In order
   to publish papers in the archive, authors must be affiliated with the
   department. Individual faculty contributions to a department's archive
   do not undergo peer review; however, their authors have undergone
   "career review" as part of the hiring and tenure process, and this
   establishes their scholarly credentials. This interesting and
   thoughtful paper includes examples of the Guild Model and a
   consideration of its pros and cons.- [28]CB
   
   Kravchyna, V., and Hastings, S. K. [29]Informational Value of Museum
   Web Sites [30]First Monday 7(2) (February 4th 2002)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_2/kravchyna/). - This
   article assesses the behavior of users in using museum Web sites, an
   interesting subject for librarians because the experience of users
   with this type of web site charts a truly new application for museums.
   The authors launched an extensive Internet survey of museum users, and
   report on their findings. Among the chief news: most people are used
   to audio and video programs and enjoy these formats on the web, and a
   high percentage or respondents visited a museum web site before
   visiting the museum itself. Obviously, an Internet-using population
   does not tell the whole story of user populations for museum
   directors, but it's an important segment of that population. The
   authors frame this paper as part of a larger investigation into the
   value of museum Web sites, and they make good use of tables and charts
   to illustrate their findings. The authors conclude that their findings
   can help guide database design, metadata creation, and retrieval
   options for museums; indeed, one hopes they're paying attention. -

   form, and the authors invite anyone who wishes to test them to contact
   them for more information. Although digital reference service can
   still be considered to be in its infancy, it's nice to know that as
   libraries begin to develop these services that there will be a common
   metric that can be used to measure the effectiveness of those
   services. - [34]RT

   (http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm0212.pdf). - If there's any
   one message to derive from this article, it's that we can't outsource
   away our IT problems. We have to understand them and their true costs
   before even thinking about handing them over to an outside agency.
   Candidates for outsourcing, the author argues, include larger
   'infrastructure' services: networking, server management and security.
   He's pretty even-handed on both the pros and cons of going this route.
   He argues that while IT is essential to our efforts in the academic
   world, it isn't one of our 'core competencies'. His urge for IT
   departments to develop more 'private-sector-like thinking and skills'
   is something everyone can agree with, though where the
   private-sector-like financing will come from is chronically unclear.
   It won't come from outsourcing. Costs there, the author advises, are
   likely to be a tad higher. - [37]LRK
   
   Pantic, Drazen. [38]"Internet the Globalizer, and the Impossibility of
   the Impossibility of the Global Dialog." [39]First Monday 7(1)
   (January 7, 2002)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_1/pantic/). - "The world's
   information pool now truly originates in a multitude of sources",
   Pantic says, and no event showed this better than the September 11
   attacks. In the wake of those days in September, the Internet assumed
   a powerful new role as a source of independent and diversified news.
   This article explores that new role and casts the drama of the
   Internet's as change agent as a battle between ideas of modernity and
   local culture. There is evidence, he argues, that a
   "trans-civilizational" dialogue is crying out to be released so much
   so that it may trump cultural behavior such as centralized control of
   media. This brief article succinctly argues that the Internet remains
   surprisingly resilient in the face of censorship efforts, despite the
   tensions between open systems and centralized governments. - [40]TH
   
   Reilly, Bernard J. [41]"What the Cultural Sector Can Learn From Enron"
   [42]First Monday 7(2) (February 4, 2002)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_2/reilly/). - The very
   public and messy debacle that engulfed the Enron Corporation is a
   metaphorical jumping-off point for the author's premise that a similar
   hall of cards may be lurking in the non-profit information sectors.
   That's a troubling possibility if there's any weight to it, and Reilly
   argues his case based on one key similarity: libraries, museums and
   other cultural repositories now "trade" in "knowledge" assets as much
   as with the assets themselves. The difference lies in the nature of
   the asset, if any. He poses the question, is there a material
   difference between coal and oil deposits and museum collections?
   Whether you agree or not, this Enron analogy will give you pause.
   "Artistic and cultural products are no longer objects, like books,
   paintings, sculpture...nor are they discrete, self-contained events in
   time, like musical performances, dance performances, and so forth," he
   asserts. The new infrastructure for cultural resources is built out of
   the licenses and contractual agreements protecting them. This "matrix"
   of conditions enables preservation, and even if bits of that matrix
   unravel, preservation strategies may be threatened. After an
   interesting exploration of this theory, he argues for better
   safeguards ("underwriting"): namely, a call for "best practices" in
   contract negotiation and licensing. The message to librarians is, once
   again, that libraries are no longer just places; they are also
   "processes" and matrices of relationships. - [43]TH

   =5040& en=9876919c1afb6ed7&ex=1015304400) - Is the weblog phenomenon
   breaking ground as "a truly new media species," or is it just the
   latest Information Age fad? It depends on who you ask...but there's no
   denying the popularity of these often very personal online journals.
   This article cites a statistic putting the current number of bloggers
   at approximately 500,000. What's fueling this boom are the advances in
   blog technology that make it easy to post short bursts of text
   frequently rather than having to update an entire Web page. Some
   companies see an opportunity in offering and supporting these
   technologies, notably Blogger.com and Userland Software, which hint
   that the next wave of interest in blogging may come from the corporate
   sector. Yet some Webheads remain skeptical, feeling it will ultimately
   prove futile expecting users to return to your weblog site day after
   day to keep up with your latest postings. According to this article,
   one Net consultancy in New York stopped posting to its weblog and
   simply started e-mailing the updated information to interested
   parties. - [50]SK
   
   Zieger, Anne. [51]"Bust the Spam Brigade" [52]IBM developerWorks
   (February 2002)
   (http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wi-spam.html) - That
   your e-mail inbox is clogged with swill is bad enough. Alas, this
   article predicts an impending boom in wireless spam -- "Wherever there
   are large groups of networked users, marketing messages are sure to
   follow." But don't rush to toss that cell phone or PDA off the nearest
   bridge just yet. The Good Guys are working on technologies that could
   ameliorate the problem. "Unsolicited commercial messages" of the
   wireless kind have already become a problem in Japan, where carrier
   NTT DoCoMo serves some 30 million subscribers. The "mobile marketing"
   types are chomping at the bit to offer you wireless coupons and other
   come-ons, ultimately based on your geographic location. The official
   party line of this industry's trade group -- yes, they have one; it's
   called the Mobile Marketing Association (formerly the [53]Wireless
   Advertising Association -- http://www.waaglobal.org/) -- is that
   commercial wireless messages should only be sent to consumers who wish
   to receive them. But, as with e-mail spam, "it's not the upstanding
   members of professional associations" who are causing the problem;
   rather, "it's the rogues with the willingness to flout professional
   conventions." The article briefly describes some potential technology
   solutions -- Brightmail's Mthree application, which lets users set
   rules for messages forwarded through wired e-mail gateways; "mobile
   messaging controls" written in Java 2, Micro Edition; and Qualcomm's
   Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), "another option for
   those who need to roll their own spam-filtering solution." Links to
   related resources are offered at the end of the article. - [54]SK
