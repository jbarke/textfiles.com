   Abreu, Elinor. [7]"Diving into the Deep Web" [8]The Standard
   (September 4, 2000)
   (http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,18134,00.html). -
   In a brief overview of a couple of companies Abreu brings to light an
   issue that librarians have worried about for a number of years -- how
   to locate information that is contained deep within web-based
   databases. Most search engines will not search within databases, or as
   Abreu calls it, "the deep Web." A recent survey suggests that there
   may be 550 billion documents in the deep web. Now there are a number
   of companies developing products that will search multiple databases
   on the web, especially because the cost of indexing has been falling.

   Borgman, Christine L. [10]"The Premise and Promise of a Global
   Information Infrastructure" [11]First Monday 5(8) (August 7, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_8/borgman/). - Borgman
   assesses the rapid growth of worldwide networking capabilities, and
   analyzes the interplay between the technology and the political forces
   that govern the introduction of technology. She argues that the
   premise of universal networking is rational, and the promise is
   exciting, because a genuine opportunity does exist to push technology
   to the places where it is needed the most. The two most likely
   pathways for the emergence of a ubiquitous network are evolutionary,
   and revolutionary. However, sustained growth in the information
   infrastructure does not necessarily yield new absolutes that will spur
   the growth of a utopian society. Borgman argues convincingly that
   existing political systems and cultural beliefs will have the greatest
   influence on the actual penetration of an information infrastructure
   throughout the world. - [12]TH
   
   Crawford, Walt. "Nine Models, One Name: Untangling the E-book Muddle"
   [13]American Libraries (September 2000): 56-59. - With all the hype
   about device-dependent e-books like the Rocket eBook and the SoftBook
   reader (now both owned by the Gemstar International Group), it's easy
   to forget that: a) e-books are not new, and b) there are a number of
   other e-book publication models. Both of these points are ably
   presented by Crawford in an easy to understand overview of e-book
   choices. Crawford readily admits to not having an answer to the
   question of which model will be important to libraries, but then who
   does? Follow this piece with the Donald Hawkins article cited in this
   month's issue of Current Cites. - [14]RT
   
   Dodds, Leigh. [15]"Instant RDF?" in [16]<xml.com> (August 30, 2000)
   (http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/08/30/instantrdf/) and Dumbill, Edd,
   [17]"Putting RDF to Work," in [18]<xml.com> (August 9, 2000)
   (http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/08/09/rdfdb/). The [19]Resource
   Description Framework (RDF, http://www.w3.org/RDF/), a mechanism for
   processing metadata (or data about data), is intended to provide
   interoperability for the exchange of machine-understandable metadata
   for online resources, whether they be text, data, image, video or
   audio files. Intelligent agents will harvest this information, which
   can then be used in resource discovery, description, and cataloguing.
   The hope is that with a standard system of resource description, a
   uniform query language will be able to perform structured queries over
   the entirety of the web. Two recent articles on RDF (the Resource
   Description Framework) in <xml.com> offer a more technical and
   behind-the-scenes slant on the standard as it evolves, covering how
   RDF will be generated, stored, culled, and processed: from
   controversies brewing on special-interest lists over the proposed data
   model and serialization syntax, to an explanation of the
   unsavory-sounding process known as "screen-scraping", to an intro to
   [20]R.V. Guha's RDFDB (http://web1.guha.com/rdfdb/), a relational
   database application for RDF that roll-up-your-sleeves types can try
   at home. Dumbill offers a practical application for a kind of
   integrative RDF Store that would cross-reference all the data on your
   PC: websites, documents, scheduling apps and email. By querying an RDF
   database for data connections on your PC you could conceivably search
   on and collect all the applicable documents and emails from that
   visiting dignitary/important client/job candidate you're meeting at
   3:00 today, and before she arrives, check out her homepage! - [21]LM
   
   "The Future of Books" CQ Researcher 10(24) (June 23 2000):545-568. - A
   collection of short articles that outline the major parameters
   surrounding the issue of electronic books. Included is a historical
   discussion of the development of printing, the business of publishing
   and recent trends in electronic publishing. Along with the articles
   are a number of useful sidebars containing statistics, as well as a
   brief bibliography. While the articles would not contain anything new
   for someone who has been following the issues it is an
   easily-accessible starting point for the neophyte interested in the
   debate surrounding e-books and the digital revolution. - ML
   
   Hawkins, Donald T. "Electronic Books: a Major Publishing Revolution.
   Part 1: General Considerations and Issues" [22]Online 24(4)
   (July/August 2000):14-28. - Few subjects freak out people who love
   books like this one does. Read the article and then recommend it to
   anybody who needs to calm down and get a grip, because it's a
   realistic and comprehensive view of current e-book publishing which
   makes it clear that the phenomenon is a new set of alternatives and
   not a plague. Hawkins provides a primer on the nature of e-books and
   the technology available for displaying them, the factors which stop
   most people from reading long works on a screen, problems publishers
   are grappling with, and how libraries are dealing with the issue. The
   thoroughness here is impressive, references are documented and the
   lists of URLs and articles for further reading are extensive. There
   will be a second part published in the September Online with the focus
   on the players in this market. - JR
   
   Madeiros, Norm. [23]"XML and the Resource Description Framework: The
   Great Web Hope" [24]Online (September 2000)
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2000/medeiros9.html). - Norm
   Madeiros makes explicit one librarian's hope for this massive Library
   of Babel we call the web: that through a standardized metadata
   framework called the Resource Description Framework (RDF), finding
   resources on the web might someday be as easy as accessing resources
   in the library using your friendly local OPAC. Libraries have been the
   originators and purveyors par excellence of metadata, from the red
   ribbon rubrics which announced the contents of scrolls in the Library
   of Alexandria to modern MARC records which form the backbone for
   various OPAC systems that guide library patrons to the shelf or
   electronic file containing the resource they seek. Evoking the W3C
   [25]RDF Model and Syntax Specification's call
   (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/) for a "Web of Trust" built on
   the twin pillars of the RDF standard and Digital Signatures, Madeiros
   traces the sad history of the prostitution of <META> tags by
   (especially e-commerce) content providers, and looks askance at the
   "popularity-contest" model of web-indexing and ranking used by search
   engines like Google. The solution may come with the adoption of RDF:
   an objective, descriptive, machine-understandable standard. For those
   new to RDF (i.e. those who involuntarily raise their eyebrows at the
   mention of "screen-scraping") Madeiros appends a couple of handy
   cut-&-paste models; the abbreviated syntax, which I excerpt here,
   works with HTML, linking to it as you would to a stylesheet, with
   <LINK>:

   Melamut, Steven J. [27]"Pursuing Fair Use, Law Libraries and
   Electronic Reserves" Law Library Journal 92(2) (Spring 2000):157-192
   (http://www.aallnet.org/products/2000-16.pdf). - Melamut takes the
   reader through an extensive overview of the leading cases and legal
   developments that face libraries which provide a formal electronic
   reserve collection. He discusses the copyright issues in traditional
   reserves spending much time on the so-called Classroom Guidelines that
   are part of the legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act and the
   applicable fair use sections of the Act. While there hasn't been any
   litigation regarding electronic reserves there are a number of
   significant cases concerning the creation of coursepacks and these
   give some indication of the legal landscape that may be applicable to
   the area of course reserves. Melamut suggests that libraries will now
   have to address the issue of the payment of permission fees given the
   fact that the technology makes it much easier to monitor the use of
   protected materials and that schools may be liable for copyright
   infringement for material from an e-reserve collection. - [28]ML
   
   Sholtz, Paul. [29]"Economics of Personal Information Exchange"
   [30]First Monday 5(9) (September 4, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_9/sholtz/). - Sholtz argues
   that personal information has become the new currency of online
   commerce. However, recent figures indicate that between 75 and 90
   million Americans regularly use the Internet, but they rarely pay for
   the content they see. These users appear to be comfortable offering
   personal information in exchange for free services and information. As
   this "economy" develops, large "libraries" of personal data are being
   accumulated, bought and sold. This article explores some of the
   connotations of e-commerce, which so far has relied upon moving
   conventional business practices to the Web. Sholtz see an emerging
   opportunity for vendors who can grasp how "communities" of customers
   can be approached in ways that protect privacy but offer online
   advantages. - [31]TH

   - [33]The School for Scanning is a long-running and well-respected
   workshop on digitization for libraries, archives, and museums. Offered
   about once a year, the workshop usually attracts more than 300
   attendees who leave the three-day session reeling under the load of
   more information than they could possibly absorb, presented by leaders
   in the field. Now this book documents some of the most important
   information the workshop has to offer, to the benefit of both those
   who attended the workshop and those who couldn't. With this hard-bound
   volume and the Kenney/Reiger work "Moving Theory Into Practice" (see
   the [34]Current Cites review), those tackling digitization projects
   will be well-equipped indeed. - [35]RT
   
   Smith, Barbara H. "To Filter or not to Filter: The Role of the Public
   Library in Determining Internet Access" Communication Law and Policy
   5(3) (Summer 2000):385-421. - As a starting point Smith discusses
   society's assumptions about the need to protect children from
   undesirable materials. She makes the point that the view of the child
   and harm has changed over the centuries resulting in a bourgeois view
   that aims to prolong the child's innocence for as long as possible.
   Building on this analysis the author outlines various theories of the
   first amendment and discusses a number of cases involving schools,
   libraries and protection of minors. In particular, she highlights the
   only filtering case to date, that of Mainstream Loudon v Board of
   Trustees of Loudon County, which held that the public library could
   not subject adults to the "electronic equivalent of a children's
   reading room." In addition, there have been a number of attempts over
   the last few years to introduce statutory law regulating Internet
   content. In the discussion of the issues surrounding filtering Smith
   suggests a three pronged solution to the problem: the introduction of
   privacy walls and screens so that other patrons would not
   inadvertently view materials they find offensive; separate children
   and adult computers with some filtering on the children's computers;
   and finally allowing parents to decide whether their children should
   be allowed to use unfiltered computers. Not everyone will agree with
   Smith's solutions, and it seems that there could be strong objections
   to parents blocking the types of materials their children --
   especially teenagers -- can access in the public library. However,
   this article clearly articulates the major arguments in the filtering
   debate and is useful in this role alone. - [36]ML
   
   Stratford, Jean Slemmons and Juri. "Computerized and Networked
   Government Information" [37]Journal of Government Information 27(3)
   (May/June 2000): 385-389. - The column, written by this couple from
   U.C. Davis, focuses in this issue on government services via the
   Internet. It's a little mystifying why the authors state that the
   focus is on international topics when most of the examples given are
   domestic. Regardless, this is a nice sampling of efforts made by
   governmental and intergovernmental groups to provide interactive
   services over the net. For me, the richest trove came from their
   description of the federal report [38]"Integrated Service Delivery:
   Governments Using Technology to Serve Citizens"
   (http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mg/intergov/isdtitp.html) because it
   led me to poke around at the root [39]policyworks.gov. This is the
   home page for the General Services Administration's Office of
   Governmentwide Policy, which has lots of links relating to aspects of
   federal information policy, the most pertinent being the one for the
   Office of Information Technology's [40]"IT Policy On-Ramp"
   (http://www.itpolicy.gsa.gov/). Besides the feds, the authors describe
   projects by the G8 countries, National Governors' Association and
   state and local agencies. - JR
