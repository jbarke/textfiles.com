   Issue Spotlight: Peer-to-Peer Networking
   
   Not since the release of NCSA Mosaic, the networking application that
   spawned the phrase "killer app", have we seen the like. Once again it
   took a youngster (in this case an 18-year-old college dropout) to rock
   our world -- with a networking application that bears his nickname:
   "Napster". But as quickly became apparent, Napster was just the first
   salvo in a new battle over freedom, intellectual property rights, and
   the future of the Internet.
   
   Other clients using the same technology (called "peer-to-peer"
   networking since it is individual clients (peers) communicating
   directly with one another instead of through a central server),
   quickly appeared, with Gnutella and Freenet being among the most
   widely known. Developments have been happening so quickly that it's
   hard to believe that Napster isn't even two years old yet, but already
   the old guard very much has it's guard up. The music industry has
   hauled Napster, Inc. into court and the publishing industry surely
   isn't far behind, if they could only find some one or some
   organization to sue. But there's the rub. With anonymous applications
   like Gnutella and Freenet, there is no one to sue. We're in an
   entirely different ball game. But don't take my word for it. This
   month we've reviewed some of the best articles we could find on this
   new phenomenon. They speculate on the future of creativity,
   publishing, and access to information in the wake of an unstoppable
   technology that will change everything. Can I possibly be any clearer?

   Adar, Eytan, and Huberman, Bernardo A. [7]"Free Riding on Gnutella."
   [8]First Monday 5(10) (October 2, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_10/adar/). - Two Xerox PARC
   researchers analyze use traffic on [9]Gnutella, the underground
   peer-to-peer file sharing service, and find that usage patterns aren't
   really all that egalitarian. Over a single 24 hour period, nearly 70
   percent of users shared no files; instead, they spent their time
   "free-riding" on the system. Of the overall traffic, 50 percent of
   responses were returned by only one percent of the total sharing host
   population. The authors determine that this does not bode well for
   community-based file sharing, since communities depend on broad
   participation, just as healthy democracies depend on a populace that
   actually takes the time to vote. Adar and Huberman suggest that
   copyright infringement fears may diminish if this trend predominates
   in similar communities. It will be interesting to follow the
   peer-to-peer underground movement's growth with this assertion in
   mind. - [10]TH
   
   Barlow, John Perry. [11]"The Next Economy of Ideas." [12]Wired
   (October 2000): 240-252
   (http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/download.html). - Building on
   his famous article [13]The Economy of Ideas, John Perry Barlow looks
   at the issue of copyright in the [14]Napster era. As Barlow comments
   "no law can be successfully imposed on a huge population that does not
   morally support it and possesses easy means for its invisible
   evasion." Launching into a scathing criticism of the entertainment
   industry and their attempts to protect intellectual property using
   such means as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Barlow sees the
   media behemoths as fighting a losing battle. In his call to arms the
   future is one where "there will be no property in cyberspace." If
   there is no property how will those creating content be rewarded and
   given incentives? He believes that the interests of creators will be
   assured by practical values: "relationship, convenience,
   interactivity, service and ethics." Summing his stance up Barlow
   envisages artists entering into relationships with consumers who will
   be ethically inclined to pay for services. While some will still
   dismiss him as a hippy out of touch with the reality of the modern
   economy his ideas are thoughtful, provocative and he might just be
   right. - [15]ML
   
   Chudnov, Daniel. [16]Docster: The Future of Document Delivery?"
   [17]Library Journal 125(13) (August 2000): 60-62. - In this
   provocative piece, Chudnov proposes that libraries modify the Napster
   model of file sharing for use in interlibrary lending. The main change
   that Chudnov suggests is to add copyright compliance. For details on
   what he suggests and how it would work, see the article. But what I
   find most impressive about this article isn't so much the details as
   the idea itself. Libraries need imaginative ideas, and this is one.
   Building on a technology that isn't even two years old yet, Chudnov
   has proposed a reasonable solution to a common library problem. We
   need more ideas like this, and more librarians with Chudnov's
   combination of imagination and technical savvy. - [18]RT

   (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articles/0,3266,55700,00.html). -
   When Time magazine "gets it," you know the rest of the population
   can't be too far behind. And this article shows that they do. What
   they "get" is that where intellectual property rights are concerned,
   the cat is out of the bag, the cow has vacated the barn, and the
   bottle no longer holds the genie. Napster is just the tip of the file
   sharing iceberg. As new peer-to-peer clients like [21]Gnutella
   (http://gnutella.wego.com/) and [22]Freenet
   (http://freenet.sourceforge.net/) show, any intellectual content is at
   risk of being freely shared on the Internet. To demonstrate this,
   Cohen uses such examples as sewing patterns (about as non-Napster like
   as you can get), which are being freely (and illegally) swapped
   online. For a taste of what Cohen has to say about all this, here are
   a couple quotes from this piece: "There is no underestimating the
   threat that all this free file sharing poses to existing business
   models" and "The only thing that is certain in the content business is
   that everything is up for grabs." And if you think this only affects
   businesses, and not non-profit libraries, think again. - [23]RT

   (October 2000): 253-259
   (http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/boies.html). - At first
   glance, it appears to many onlookers that it is clearly illegal for
   users to record MP3 files from copyrighted CDs and make them available
   for dowloading by any Napster user on the planet. But as this
   interview with the lead defense attorney in the Napster case points
   out, this is far from an open-and-shut case of copyright infringement.
   He identifies four major arguments that the defense is making, any one
   of which will win their case if they prevail. Frankly, I couldn't care
   less if Napster gets shut down, but the legal defense of Napster
   involves issues that go much beyond whether a particular company can
   continue to do business or not. - [26]RT
   
   Kuptz, Jerome. [27]"Independence Array." [28]Wired (October 2000):

   The tagline to this overview of how Gnutella works is "Gnutella:
   Unstoppable by Design". And they aren't kidding. Smart people with
   nothing better to do have worked hard at making sure that files can be
   shared directly between individual network users in an undetectable
   and untraceable fashion. Sneaking through via the HTTP protocol
   (here's a hint, it's the protocol upon which the web runs), there are
   no central servers (like with Napster), no log files, and no central
   organization behind it. This two-page spread on how Gnutella actually
   works is available on the web, but the graphic version in the print
   copy of the magazine lays out the whole bloody mess in a much more
   entertaining fashion. - [29]RT

   Technology in the Perseus Digital Library" [31]Cultivate Interactive
   (October 2000) (http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue2/perseus/). - The
   [32]Perseus Project is one of the most well-developed scholar-led
   digital library projects around. In this conceptual overview of the
   project and its many aspects and phases, Crane et. al. describe the
   motivations behind this eclectic set of collections. Maybe it was
   their enthusiasm or their "can-do" attitude, but by the end of the
   article it actually made sense to me that the project should be
   dabbling in Shakespeare and Arabic texts on mechanics at the same
   time. As they put it, "While all these projects differ substantially,
   they are united by our consistent effort to study the ways in which
   documents which are distinct in print libraries begin to merge with
   one another in a digital library, dissolving their individual
   structures and supporting new patterns of intellectual inquiry." Areas
   in which they remain interested include: 1) the development of new
   integrated collections, 2) the cognitive effects of digital libraries,
   3) integration of modern computational linguistic techniques, and 4)
   information extraction and visualization. Those wishing for more
   technical background on the project should refer to Crane's [33]recent
   piece in D-Lib Magazine. - [34]RT

   (September 2000): 112-115
   (http://www.lita.org/ital/1903_editorial.html). - I distinctly
   remember returning from the 1989 American Library Association Annual
   Conference and rushing to sign on to a new electronic discussion that
   had just been announced at the conference: the [37]Public Access
   Computer Systems Forum, or PACS-L. Unfortunately, the instructions for
   signing up assumed you were on BITNET, and I was trying to sign on via
   the Internet. The ensuing days of digging around for documentation and
   discovering the way I had to send my message to sign on was one of my
   first trials by fire on the Internet. But PACS-L was well worth the
   effort, and was so for years. As Crawford documents so well, PACS-L
   was *the* library discussion list of most of the 90's, before becoming
   a victim of its own success. Although it has been resurrected, it will
   never be the same as it was when a profession was remaking itself in
   light of world-wide computer connectivity. If this sounds nostalgic,
   it is, as is Crawford's tribute. I guess you just had to be there. -

   Internet: Dutch Women Unite." [40]First Monday 5(10) (October 2, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_10/drost/). - Drost and Jorna
   assess the experience of a Dutch collective known as
   [41]"Webgrrls-NL", an organization whose goal is to train Dutch women
   in the use of the Internet. Webgrrls creates a forum where Dutch women
   can learn about computers and the Internet "without the intervention
   of men or others who feel the need to show rather than to teach." That
   quote points out the feminist perspective of this organization, but it
   also opens the door to think about the ways in which different
   communities can best learn in the Internet era. A large body of
   research confirms that women and men approach technology differently,
   and this article is further grist for the mill. It's also interesting
   and very pragmatic in its approach. The conclusions that are offered
   could easily apply to other self-identifying groups who wish to take
   advantage of the Internet on their own terms. - [42]TH

   Monday 5(10) (October 2, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_10/evans/). - Social
   theorists and futurists will enjoy this well-researched inquiry into
   the nature of democracy in the Net era. Heavily footnoted and densely
   populated with ideas and questions, this article nonetheless raises
   some blunt questions that are on a lot of peoples' minds. For example,
   what are the characteristics of the body politic, if it's living in
   the "real" and the "virtual" worlds at the same time? What are the
   hazards of this new and uncharted domain for affecting hearts and
   minds in the political process? While the author has many optimistic
   analyses to share, he also finds a "dark" side to politics and the
   Net, which he categories as oracular in nature. - [45]TH
   
   Griffiths, Jose-Marie. "Deconstructing Earth's Largest Library"

   readers are familiar with [47]Steve Coffman's provocative thoughts on
   what librarians can learn from Amazon.com. This piece aims to "debunk"
   Coffman's ideas. Since Griffith does not make her points as clearly
   and forcefully as [48]Walt Crawford, they are somewhat difficult to
   extract, but they can be roughly summarized as "we can't cooperate
   enough to pull it off, our current automated systems are too limited,
   and it would be too difficult and costly." From there, Griffiths
   explores the issues of digital opportunities (formerly known as the
   Digital Divide), the library as place, and the value of the library
   'brand'. A sidebar highlights the [49]Internet Public Library,
   [50]Contentville.com, and [51]Fathom.com as "libraries in cyberspace."

   moving so rapidly that any list of players quickly becomes outdated."
   Some of the specifics relating to the vendors here have changed since
   the article's publication, with probably the biggest news being that
   Rocket eBooks and SoftBooks now have the same parent company and are
   sold through eBook-Gemstar. So, check the company websites listed for
   the latest word. As for Hawkins' more general take on how the market
   is shaping up, this is an excellent continuation of part 1, which was
   published in the July/August issue. He explores the many ways
   (including device-independent ways) in which e-books are being
   disseminated, including the system of interest to many libraries now,

   the worse for wear, just in time to face the five "great challenges"
   Rutenbeck identifies in this provocative piece. What are they, you
   ask? 1) Malleability: "through digital technologies we're inclined to
   do much more than preserve or distribute information: we're prone to
   manipulate it, alter it, and enhance it in often profound ways", 2)
   Selectivity: selecting digital over print; selecting the small amount
   of print materials we're capable of digitizing, 3) Exclusivity: the
   digital divide, the dominance of English as the language of the
   Internet, the necessity to have typing skills, 4) Vulnerability: "we
   are only now beginning to realize that the benefits of
   interconnectedness via the global network also bring with them an
   unprecedented shared vulnerability", and 5) Superficiality: the
   shallowness of our interactions with information and others in a
   networked world. Whether or not you agree with Rutenbeck's assertions,
   or his elevation of them to "great challenges", these issues are
   important and may be increasingly so. - [55]RT
   
   "Special Issue: Digital Reference Services: Papers Based on the

   Quarterly 39(4) (Summer 2000) - We've come far from the notion that
   online reference service is a nice embellishment, to an expection from
   users that there will be a computer interface available for any
   library need, including that (potentially) most complex exchange, the
   reference session. The articles here address such issues as assessing
   the quality of online reference service, the "how-to" points to
   consider when creating such a service, what to expect in workload
   changes and how to manage them, how to create a successful reference
   interview environment when the face to face element is removed, and
   how the culture of library use for reference information is changing.
   The gatekeeper function of reference librarians is changing, some
   would say radically, and these articles are very helpful for
   information providers adapting to the new patterns of
   information-seeking behavior. - JR

   survey data one can glean such interesting nuggets as the fact that of
   the respondents, less than a third have attended an HTML workshop or
   seminar, and 83% of respondents were self-taught to a greater or
   lesser degree. A finding I found surprising was that more than 50% of
   the respondents shared their position with another person or
   committee. The vast majority find satisfaction in their work, and what
   the largest number liked the least was not having enough time to spend
   on the web site and to learn new skills. Taylor ends the review of
   survey results with a list of recommendations based on her findings. -

   the most far reaching and effective delivery of information services
   via the Internet has been by Federal and State governments. In this
   study of "E-Government" the author surveyed over 1800 websites during
   the Summer, 2000. Unsurprisingly, states with smaller populations and
   therefore fewer resources performed poorly compared to larger states,
   and federal government provided better services compared to state
   governments. Overall the websites were weakest in areas of security,
   privacy, disability access, offering specific online services such as
   purchasing a license, filing a complaint or requesting a publication,
   and democratic outreach such as email, message boards and the ability
   for citizens to receive periodic updates on specific issues. The
   conclusion of the study is that the "e-government revolution has
   fallen short of its true potential." - [61]ML
