   Arms, William. "Automated Digital Libraries: How Effectively Can
   Computers Be Used for the Skilled Tasks of Professional
   Librarianship?" D-Lib Magazine 6(7/8)(July/August 2000)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july00/arms/07arms.html). - In Current Cites
   we don't just cite articles we agree with, we cite articles we think
   you should read. This one falls into the latter category. In it Arms
   (a computer scientist active in digital library development) posits a
   question that he then forgets to answer. But what "answer" he does
   provide is very disturbing. To begin with, he reduces the question to
   one of cost. That is, can automated digital libraries provide an
   "acceptable substitute" at a lower cost. Apparently they can, to
   someone who thinks Google provides better service than Inspec, as Arms
   claims. Unfortunately I do not have the space to refute Arms' opinion
   and unsubstantiated arguments that appear to suggest that automated
   digital libraries can perform most of the skilled tasks of
   professional librarianship. At least he seems to acknowledge that
   reference service is likely to remain too difficult for machines,
   although he relies on personal anecdotes when scholarly evidence such
   as that published by Bonnie Nardi is close at hand. For those of
   you who are librarians, read this piece closely. It largely depicts
   what computer scientists think of you, the libraries you have built
   and are building, and the value of human-constructed and maintained
   library collections and services. It is not a pretty sight. - RT
   
   Baker, Nicholson. "Deadline: The Author's Desperate Bid to Save
   America's Past" The New Yorker (July 24, 2000): 42-61. - Nicholson
   Baker is well-known to the library community for his 1994 and 1996
   articles in The New Yorker bemoaning the demise of the card catalog
   and taking to task the San Francisco Public Library for discarding
   books. He goes on the offensive once more with a quixotic attempt to
   save long-runs of American newspapers from being discarded after the
   process of microfilming. As with his other library pieces, Baker is no
   detached observer but a fully-fledged participant, actually forming
   his own non-profit organization, the American Newspaper Repository, in
   an attempt to save numerous sets of historical newspaper from being
   sold by the British Library. The piece highlights some important
   issues regarding the process of microfilming for preservation and
   archival purposes with Baker severely criticizing the library
   community for not doing enough to ensure the preservation of at least
   some hard copy runs of newspapers. He is particularly vexed at what he
   sees as the poor quality of much microfilming and what he views,
   rather unfairly, as the overblown claims of librarian administrators
   concerning issues of space and the degradation of much newsprint,
   especially from the 19th century. He correctly points out that with
   the demise of paper collections that companies such as Bell & Howell,
   which owns microfilm negatives for most large newspapers, has "a
   near-monopoly on the reproduction rights for the chief primary sources
   of twentieth-century history." As with all his articles the writing is
   of top quality, especially his description of a company in New Jersey,
   the Historic Newspaper archives, that sells newspapers to give as
   gifts for particular birth-dates. This article is sure to cause much
   debate in the library world. - ML
   
   Borgman, Christine L. From Gutenberg to the Global Information
   Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World
   Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000. - Despite a rather unsatisfying title,
   Borgman has succeeded in writing the definitive text book for digital
   library courses. Since the author is a professor at the UCLA library
   school, and a visiting professor at Loughborough University in
   England, this comes as no surprise. As one expects of a textbook, it
   is an authoritative overview of the issues, with frequent references
   to the supporting literature. Don't expect to be able to run out and
   build digital library collections and services based on what you learn
   here, but do expect to have a thorough grounding in the field from a
   scholarly perspective. - RT
   
   Guides to Quality in Visual Resource Imaging. Council on Library
   and Information Resources, 2000 (http://www.rlg.org/visguides/). -
   Anyone digitizing visual resources owes it to their project to study
   the information at this site. Collected together in one location is
   some of the best advice on digital imaging from top-notch experts in
   the field. Practical information is offered on planning a project,
   selecting a scanner, factors affecting image quality, measuring
   quality of digital masters, and file formats for master files. This is
   not a static publication, but will be updated periodically to keep it
   up-to-date with current standards and best practices. An excellent
   resource from the Research Libraries Group, the
   Digital Library Federation, and the Council on Library and
   Information Resources. - RT
   
   LC21: A Digital Strategy for the Library of Congress Washington,
   DC: National Academy Press, 2000
   (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309071445/html/). - This report comprises
   the findings of a committee of the National Research Council that
   reviewed the Library of Congress' technology practices and
   initiatives. Although the report focuses on the Library of Congress,
   there is much here that can serve as useful advice for other
   libraries. Skip over the sections and chapters that focus directly on
   the LOC, and find the parts that deal more broadly with topics that
   impact (or will) all libraries. Specific chapters to pay particular
   attention to (at least in part) include the introductory chapter and
   those on collection development, preservation, and organization for
   access. - RT
   
   Miller, Paul. "Interoperability: What is it and Why Should I Want
   it?" Ariadne
   (24) (June 2000) (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue24/interoperability/).
   - Interoperability between digital libraries is essential if library
   users are to be offered simple access to a wide variety of library
   content and services. Without it, library users must first discover
   where all the various digital library collections can be found, and
   then go to each one and search them individually. In this excellent
   overview, the interoperability expert for the United Kingdom's
   eLib Programme defines interoperability and describes all of its
   various dimensions in the digital library context. The web site that
   the author manages, Interoperability Focus
   (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/interop-focus/) is also a good resource for
   further information. - RT 

   The Secret Books
   (http://www.thesecretbooks.com/). - Okay, secret or not-so-secret
   digital bibliophiles: take a break from your monthly Current Cites
   reading list to visit this stunning flash- or dhtml-enhanced
   photographic interpretation of snippets of various of Borges' essays
   on books and libraries, including the ubiquitous "Library of Babel."
   Yes, on one plane this site serves as a glamorous advertisement to buy
   the photographer's physical book. But provocative photographic
   juxtapositions of old books with snakes, fruit, stone, voodoo candles,
   inscribed skulls and mirrors offer up a gorgeous statement on books
   and materiality in an ironically digital wrapper, as well as an
   elegant conversation between Borges' texts and Kernan's images. -

   Tennant, Roy. "Beg, Buy, Borrow, License or Steal" LJ Digital
   (July 15, 2000)
   (http://www.ljdigital.com/articles/infotech/digitallibraries/20000615_
   15167.asp) - For librarians building digital libraries in this age of
   the digital incunabulum, juggling the market (should we buy? license?
   scan an out-of-copyright version of? this or that very expensive
   digital publication) can make one's head spin. Our Current Cites
   colleague Roy Tennant offers some judicious advice stemming from his
   experience and expertise as the SunSITE manager at UC Berkeley, and
   now as eScholarship Web & Services Manager at the California Digital
   Library. Knowing one's options -- and orchestrating the right mix --
   are the key. Roy outlines the strengths of each of the means he
   suggests in his title and provides a sidebar of useful links to help
   to get your head on straight. - LM
   
   Young, Jeffrey R. "A Historian Presents the Civil War, Online and
   Unfiltered by Historians" NY Times Technology Circuits
   (http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/06/circuits/articles/29ayer.ht
   ml) - The Valley of the Shadow project
   (http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu) has been on the web for nearly five
   years, but as truly one of the most stunning digital archive success
   stories going, it garners renewed mention by Young on the eve of the
   release of the CD-ROM version. Under the aegis of the University of
   Virginia and the leadership of history professor Edward L. Ayers, the
   archive contains some 5000 pages of digitized photographs, newspaper
   articles, records, wills, census figures, and diaries covering the
   years 1857 to 1870 and issuing from two representative counties, one
   in Pennsylvania and one in Virginia. In his article, Young
   characterizes it as a "do-it-yourself history kit," where users can
   let their own research into the sources lead them to their own
   conclusions. With the boon of database searching, modern users can
   find connections which might have taken pre-Valley researchers an
   entire sabbatical to cobble together. And, as Young points out, the
   sources themselves take a refreshingly wide cross-section, from a
   slave woman's letter to her husband on her impending sale to traders,
   to the insipid diary entries of an upper-class teenager. The CD-ROM
   version, due out next month, is being touted as an interactive hybrid
   of multimedia and scholarship, or an "interactive archive." - LM
