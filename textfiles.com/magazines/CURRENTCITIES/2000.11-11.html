   Cisler, Steve. [7]"Letter from Cambridge: Digital Nations and
   eDevelopment Meetings." [8]First Monday 5(11) (November 5, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_11/cisler/). - The author
   reports on a new initiative known as "Digital Nations", which was
   launched by MIT's Media Lab on October 18, 2000. The project seeks to
   assess the impact of digital convergence on the traditional concept of
   the nation-state, particularly among nations with minimal information
   infrastructures. The participants clearly hope to influence the
   international dialogue about developing nations as well as
   industrialized nations, and they argue that technology planning should
   benefit both ends of the spectrum. - [9]TH
   
   Fichter, Darlene and Frank Cervone. "Documents, Data, Information
   Retrieval and XML." [10]Online 24(6) (November 2000): 30-36. - For
   those to whom XML is still new territory, this article may serve as a
   useful introduction. For those who understand the meaning of
   "well-formed" this piece will be too basic. After an introduction to
   XML and XHTML, Fichter and Cervone highlight a couple of applications
   for XML - Rich Site Summary (RSS) for describing the contents of web
   sites, and the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) for data codebooks.
   Appropriate web site addresses accompany the piece. - [11]RT

   Magazine 6(11) (November 2000)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november00/flecker/11flecker.html). -
   Harvard University granted its library $12 million over five years to
   "build a first generation production infrastructure to support digital
   library collections." This article is to some degree an update on
   their progress, some halfway through the grant. Flecker outlines the
   Harvard Library's technical, collections, and access infrastructure
   and the common services which they share. He touches on the variety of
   projects they have funded to provide digital content, and ends up with
   a current assessment and outline of further developments. Anyone
   interested in how Harvard is addressing the opportunities and
   challenges of digital libraries will find this to be a good overview
   of the variety of infrastructure and content development projects in
   which they are engaged. - [14]RT

   from a Distance." [16]First Monday 5(11), November 5, 2000
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_11/forbes/). - Forbes uses
   engineering continuing education as an example to explore distance
   learning for professionals in knowledge related fields. The format is
   brief and to the point, with evaluations of college programs and
   accreditation. She also addresses the practical ways in which distance
   learning can mesh with the career-spanning necessity for knowledge
   workers to receive training and earn credentials that reflect
   knowledge gains. - [17]TH
   
   Lipinski, Tomas A. "Legal Issues in Accessing and Managing the
   Metadata of Digital Objects." Technicalities 20(3) (May/June 2000) :1.
   - In this article Lipinski discusses the implications of providing
   links to websites from library catalog records, including the issue of
   using frames to accomplish this goal. The author outlines potential
   areas of legal concern: trespass, trademarks, copyright, and
   defamation. Citing current cases in each of these areas Lipinski
   clearly delineates situations in which libraries may encounter
   problems. These include linking to a publishers web site but bypassing
   introductory material and advertisements; using trademarked symbols in
   a library catalog thereby interfering with its distinctiveness;
   posting or framing that involves unauthorized reproduction and the
   infringing on the exclusive rights of copyright owners to display or
   distribute their work; and finally whether a library becomes liable
   for any defamatory material as a "publisher" of content. This is an
   excellent introduction to these major areas of concern for libraries.

   Marcum, Deanna. "Digital Archiving: Whose Responsibility Is It?"
   [19]College & Research Libraries News 61(9) (October 2000):
   794-797;807. - Few questions are as perplexing to librarians as how to
   preserve digital material, and few among our number are as qualified
   to consider this question as the president of the Council on Library
   and Information Resources. The bulk of the piece focuses on the the
   CLIR/Digital Library Federation-produced document [20]"Minimum
   criteria for an archival repository of digital scholarly journals"
   (http://www.clir.org/diglib/preserve/criteria.htm), which identifies
   seven specific criteria for setting up a trusted digital archive. On
   the "who's responsible?" question, Marcum advocates that both
   publishers and libraries (which occasionally are the same
   organization) both have responsibilities. Publishers must be explicit
   about their preservation policies, and librarians must respond
   appropriately given the relative strength or weakness of such
   policies, or the amount of trust that can be placed in the
   organization behind the policy. - [21]RT
   
   O'Leary, Mick. [22]"Grading the Library Portals" [23]Online 24(6)
   (November/December 2000):38-44
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2000/oleary11.html). - I spotted
   this article just after attending a meeting about improving our campus
   library's portal to collections and services. It's not what I'd hoped;
   the portals which O'Leary rates are really librarianship portals.
   After the initial disappointment wore off, I began to see that the
   best among these Web sites for librarians would lead to lots of great
   ideas for grappling with my particular problem, as well as issues in
   every other aspect of librarianship: administration, collection
   development, interlibrary loan, etc. After a brief description of what
   he means by a "library portal" (in which he broadly compliments all
   visitors to these sites as already being electronic information
   experts, thanks very much), O'Leary divides his group of sites into
   vendor, commercial and library developed portals. The distinction
   between the first two is a little blurred. The grading and comments
   are useful in weeding out portals which are incomplete, innacurate,
   incomprehensible or oriented toward selling a particular product. In
   the interest of complete disclosure, we point out that one of the two
   "A" grades was given to our Sunsite-hosted [24]LibraryLand

   Libraries 20(10) (November/December 2000): 26-34
   (http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/nov00/raitt.htm). - This overview of
   European digital library projects briefly outlines initiatives in
   France, Germany, Russia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Spain, the
   Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Given the broad geographic range
   of this overview, it is by no means comprehensive, but it can
   nonetheless serve as a good introduction to the breadth and depth of
   digital library developments in Europe -- any one of which is worthy
   of an article on it alone. A sidebar lists all the project URLs in a
   handy list that signifies hours of happy browsing by anyone interested
   in such projects. - [27]RT
   
   Sherman, Chris. "Napster: Copyright Killer or Distribution Hero?"
   [28]Online 24(6) (November 2000): 18-28. - Faithful Current Cites
   readers already know that we think peer-to-peer networking is well
   worth our attention (see the [29]October 2000 issue if you don't
   recall). For those of you who missed that issue, or found yourselves
   on another planet for the past year and missed all the press about
   Napster, your ignorance will not go unrewarded. Rather than reading a
   pile of articles on Napster, Gnutella, and their peer-to-peer cousins
   that are cropping up like rabbits, this one article will go a long way
   toward bringing you up-to-speed. Sherman craftily introduces the topic
   by referring to a music copyright controversy from a century ago that
   has chilling parallels (as well as significant differences) to
   today's. Explanations of Napster and Gnutella follow, as well as
   vignettes on FreeNet, MojoNation, and [30]Dan Chudnov's Docster
   concept. Altogether an excellent read about a topic that librarians
   (and those in many other professions) can ignore at their peril. -

   Varian, Hal R and Lyman, Peter. [32]How Much Information? Berkeley,
   CA: University of California, 2000
   (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/). - In this 200 page
   report produced by faculty and students at the [33]School of
   Information Management and Systems at the University of California at
   Berkeley the authors attempt to measure how much information is
   produced in the world each year. They look at several media and
   estimate yearly production, accumulated stock, rates of growth, and
   other variables of interest. Taking advantage of the web environment
   the document indicates where they make "questionable" assumptions and
   they intend to update the document based on contributions by readers.
   The authors identify production of content in four physical media --
   paper, film, optical (CDs and DVDs), and magnetic -- then translate
   the volume of original content into a common standard (terabytes),
   determine how much storage each type takes and calculate total
   estimates. They outline 3 major findings: printed material only makes
   up .003% of the total storage of information; a vast majority of
   information is created and stored by individuals rather than
   institutions; and finally digital information is the largest in total
   and the fastest growing. The not suprising conclusion is that "we are
   all drowning in a sea of information" with information production at
   about 250 megabytes for each man, woman, and child in the world. -

   Withers, Rob, et. al. [35]"Information Architecture: Tools for
   Cutting-Edge Web Developers" [36]College & Research Libraries News
   61(9) (October 2000): (http://www.ala.org/acrl/resoct00.html). - For
   the budding information architect, or the experienced web manager,
   this piece covers some essential web sites, electronic discussions,
   and other information resources on IA and methods for creating dynamic
   web content. Under the misleading heading "dynamic scripting
   languages", they list resources on that topic as well as databases,
   web application servers, and an open source integrated library system
   project (it appears as if the main criteria for inclusion was that the
   project be free, open source, or both, since only one commercial web
   application server is mentioned -- Cold Fusion -- when most people are
   more likely to have Microsoft's Active Server Pages at their
   disposal). Despite the lack of comprehensitivity, the resources cited
   here are clearly central to any full-bore web manager or information
   architect. Those who aren't quite ready to tackle Perl or PHP can
   stick to the first part of the piece, which focuses on resources of
   more general interest. - [37]RT
