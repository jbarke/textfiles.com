   Arms, William Y. "Preservation of Scientific Serials: Three Current
   Examples" Journal of Electronic Publishing 5(2) (December 1999)
   (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/05-02/arms.html). - Arms, current
   Editor-in-Chief of D-Lib Magazine, (http://www.dlib.org/) offers three
   case studies that explore the capabilities and efforts of three
   digital publications to meet the challenges of preserving digital
   resources into the next millennium. The ACM Digital Library, the
   Internet RFC series, and D-Lib Magazine were selected as
   representative paradigms displaying significant variations in
   organizational stability and technical specs for the storage and
   delivery of data. Arms examines the feasibility of three commonly
   cited levels of preservation: conservation (full look and feel of the
   scientific article and journal as an artifact), preservation of access
   (maintenance of the material and an effective system of access through
   indexing, metadata, etc.), and preservation of content (warehoused
   articles with minimal metadata). The ultimate question is, to whom
   will the responsibility of preservation fall: publishers?
   not-for-profit institutions, such as university libraries? charitable
   foundations? national archives? Arms envisions a period of initial
   active management by publishers, followed by preservation by another
   body, perhaps the Library of Congress. The ideal solution will no
   doubt arise from a partnership amongst the scientific community,
   publishers, and libraries. - LM
   
   Breeding, Marshall. "Does the Web Spell Doom for CD and DVD?"
   Computers in Libraries 19(10) (November/ December 1999)
   (http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/nov99/breeding.htm) - Breeding states
   boldly that the trend is "an unmistakable migration away from
   CD-ROM-based products toward web-based information resources accessed
   via the Internet." When CD-ROMs first gained wide use in the library
   world, the user was faced with having to use and learn different
   search protocols for each product running on individual PCs. The
   appearance of CD-ROM networks allowed for multiple access but users
   still faced the problem of multiple search interfaces and the
   difficulty of installation and maintenance. Now the web environment
   uses a model of information whereby the database is stored on a
   centralized server via the Internet or even on locally based servers.
   This is much easier for libraries who can build a standard network
   around TCP/IP - there is no need for proprietary software,
   installation or updating of CDs. In addition the move to web-based
   catalogs allows for greater integration of electronic resources,
   indexes, abstracts and full-text databases. Finally, while search
   interfaces do differ there is a certain homogeneity because of
   web-based approach. Breeding makes a number of predictions. Libraries
   will not be installing large scale CD-ROM networks but using a
   miniserver approach; as "the web is the ubiquitous approach for
   providing access to library resources to remote users" even non-web
   based resources will be accessed via web-launching applications. CDs
   and DVDs will only be used a distribution medium with DVD gradually
   becoming the standard, and vendors will themselves move away from
   these formats to FTP for updating. Breeding suggests diversifying
   servers so that heavily used databases are on local intranet servers
   in order to offer better performance. - ML
   
   Carvajal, Doreen. "Racing to Convert Books to Bytes" New York Times
   (December 9, 1999): C1; C27. - In this informative overview of the
   trend within publishing to producing digital books, Carvajal
   highlights the example of the University of Texas at Austin. The
   University has a $1 million budget for digital books and a collection
   of 600 titles with access to over 5000 titles via consortiums. There
   are digital readers that allow users to download electronic titles and
   in the near future users will be able to create their own customized
   versions of books. Random House is attempting to digitize it's entire
   backlist of 20,000 titles, while Simon & Schuster is formatting all
   new books in digital form and starting on it's own backlist. Various
   European publishers have announced that they will produce electronic
   books that can be read in Microsoft's upcoming Microsoft Reader
   software, and journal publishers are joining together to allow
   electronic links between citations. As it is difficult for new
   publishers in the burgeoning field to get hold of titles much
   expansion has been with public domain titles. One publisher,
   NetLibrary is outsourcing data entry to countries such as China and
   India and then marketing to major libraries to buy electronic
   collections. There are still some doubts about whether this will be a
   successful venture on the part of publishers. At the moment most
   ebooks are the same price as print counterparts and all companies are
   grappling with the problem of whether readers will warm to these
   formats with many banking on the younger digital generation leading
   the charge. - ML
   
   Conservation Implications of Digitization Projects National Digital
   Library Program and the Conservation Division, Library of Congress.
   Washington: Library of Congress, 1999
   (http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/techdocs/conserv83199a.pdf). - This
   report largely describes the procedures followed by the Library of
   Congress to ensure the proper handling of materials when digitizing.
   Given the wide diversity of material types digitized by LC, as well as
   the volume of materials handled and the length of time LC has been
   doing this kind of activity, this information on how LC does it can be
   extremely valuable to those with less experience. Appendix I is a
   handout used for an in-house course, and is available separately at
   http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/techdocs/conserv83199b.pdf. Appendices II
   and III are promised shortly, and will be listed at
   http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ftpfiles.html when they are available. -

   Dutton, William H., Anita Elberse and Matthew Hale. "A Case Study of a
   Netizen's Guide to Elections" Communications of the ACM 42(12)
   (December, 1999) - The horserace metaphor for an election brings to
   mind this homily: you can lead 'em to water, but you can't make 'em
   drink. For the 1998 California gubernatorial primary, voters could dip
   into the Democracy Network (http://www.dnet.org/), a much deeper well
   of candidate info than what was available from traditional sources.
   This case study describes the construction of the site, the methods of
   gathering content, and the patterns of use. It was a wonderful
   resource for people who cared enough to research the issues, but of
   course its impact on voters' decision-making process was small
   compared to the effect of broadcast media. As one campaign manager put
   it, "It is going to come down to potentially who the voters like
   better, character and personality... commercials, and quick sound bite
   flashes, show what kind of people they are." However, in the usage
   patterns the authors do see some encouraging signs: the increase in
   focused searches during the week prior to the election could indicate
   good use of the site for making informed choices. The study is
   valuable for those of us who assist with research in politics and
   government, but it's also of interest to anyone pondering the effects
   of the Internet on information-seeking behavior. - JR
   
   Graham, Margaret E. "The Description and Indexing of Images: Report of
   a Survey of ARLIS Members, 1998/99" Newcastle: Institute for Image
   Data Research, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, May 1999
   (http://www.unn.ac.uk/iidr/ARLIS/). - This report comes out of an
   effort led by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the
   Higher Education Funding Councils in the UK to study the efficacy of
   content-based image retrieval (CBIR, see the report cited in the
   September 1999 issue of Current Cites and the web site at
   http://www.unn.ac.uk/iidr/CBIR/cbir.html). To support that work, it
   was decided to survey current practice for indexing images among
   institutional members of the Art Libraries Society (UK). The findings
   of that survey, conducted from November 1998 to January 1999, are
   summarized here. Anyone interested in current practice in indexing
   images will find this report useful, with one caveat. Despite the fact
   that typically only about 25% of the respondents felt that CBIR might
   be useful to any degree whatsoever, they nonetheless put an overly
   positive light on that finding by basically ignoring the overwhelming
   majority who answered "Don't Know" or "No Response" (accounting for
   over 60% of the responses in most cases). - RT
   
   Guernsey, Lisa. "The Web: New Ticket to a Pink Slip" New York Times
   (December 16 1999): D1, D8, D9. - Guernsey highlights recent trends in
   workplace surveillance. 40 employees of Xerox were recently fired for
   surfing to "forbidden" web sites at work. They were caught because
   Xerox, and numerous other large corporations, are using specialized
   software such as Spector or Websense to monitor employees computer
   use. Approximately 45% of employers use a variety of monitoring
   techniques whether of phone calls, email or computer use. Their
   argument is that this is necessary to clamp down on time wasted by
   employees and also to stop employees from creating a potentially
   hostile environment for their fellow workers. The monitoring of
   workers has a long history in US labor relations but the Internet has
   added a whole new area for management intrusion. While there are some
   laws, mostly concerning wiretapping, that offer some protection to
   workers, this is an unsettled area of the law. There are some cases of
   employees arguing that their privacy rights have been invaded by
   electronic monitoring but none thus far have reached a jury. Many
   privacy groups are arguing that workers have greater expectation
   privacy rights in the workplace than employers are willing to
   recognize. In a sidebar "What Employers Can View at Work" Guernsey
   outlines some parameters of worker privacy. As she starkly states
   "most employees should not consider their office email to be private,
   nor should they assume that their employers are not looking at logs of
   web sites they have visited." - ML
   
   Harnad, Stevan. Free at Last: The Future of Peer-Reviewed Journals"
   D-Lib Magazine 5(12) (December 1999)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december99/12harnad.html). - Harnad has long
   been a vocal advocate of using networking technologies to free
   scholarly communication from standard publishing models. In his most
   recent argument for such a change, published by D-Lib Magazine as an
   opinion piece (for which they also take pains to absolve themselves of
   any implied support), he advocates methods by which authors of
   scholarly works can "self-archive" their work. If such local archives
   follow the emerging conventions of the Open Archives Initiative
   (http://www.openarchives.org/), then the resulting interoperability
   would enable users to easily locate a specific paper in whatever
   archive it is stored. This, Harnad asserts, is inevitable -- all that
   is required is that universities (and more specifically, the
   librarians working there) rise to the challenge of implementing the
   appropriate infrastructures and support mechanisms for authors.
   Interestingly enough, some universities are rising to the challenge.
   One such example is the Electronic Scholarship initiative of the
   California Digital Library of the University of California. - RT
   
   Heckart, Ronald J. "Imagining the Digital Library in a Commercialized
   Internet" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 25:4 (July
   1999):274-280. - In this thought provoking article, Heckart considers
   the ripe technologies of artificially intelligent navigational tools,
   interactive (personalized) technologies, and user data collection and
   analysis in the context of digital libraries. Of particular interest
   is Heckart's consideration of the user's expectations for such
   technologies and tools in the library setting based on their
   commercial Internet experiences. His thoughts on the meaning of a
   balance between user privacy and service brings to light a major
   digital library issue. The article is an excellent example of
   "informed speculation" and bears a thorough read for anyone doing
   digital library planning or brainstorming. - LR
   
   Kelly, Henry. "Information Technology and the Environment: Choices and
   Opportunities" iMP Magazine (Information Impacts Magazine) (October
   1999) (http://www.cisp.org/imp/october_99/10_99kelly.htm) - Serving as
   the Assistant Director for Technology in the White House Office of
   Science and Technology Policy, Kelly discusses environmental impact of
   information technology and presents areas for possible resource
   savings when developing, manufacturing, and choosing information
   technologies. Kelly's article presents the relationship between
   economic growth and reduced natural resource consumption in terms of
   three fundamental features: intelligent production processes,
   intelligent design of products, and intelligent operation of products.
   While libraries may not often concern their technology use with the
   fate of natural resources, there is room for us to play a responsible
   role in the planning, creation and implementation of resource
   efficient information technologies. - LR
   
   Lieb, Thom. "Looking Good" The Journal of Electronic Publishing 5(2)
   (December 1999) (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/05-02/lieb0502.html) -
   This article examines in a nutshell the sad plight of electronic
   publishers caught up in the struggle to produce uniform pages in spite
   of browsers' variations in supporting Java and Javascript, frames,
   style sheets, dynamic HTML (DHTML) and tables, to name the most
   obvious landmines in "the Browser Wars." He also covers a number of
   publishing-specific problems issuing for the most part from
   differences in platform: offset, text size, tracking and leading.
   Monitors also join the fray, as the source of problems relating to
   canvas size. But, he cautions, even when all external adversaries in
   the Browser and Platform Wars have been vanquished, bad output may
   simply come down to bad coding, concerning which some browsers are
   more lenient than others. In the end, the best advice is the most
   obvious: Lieb advocates using a code validator, adhering to the lowest
   common denominator in terms of presentation, and giving more weight to
   content. - LM
   
   Miller, Rush G. and Peter X. Zhou. "Global Resource Sharing: A Gateway
   Model" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 25(4) (July
   1999):281-287. - Miller and Zhou share the success of the University
   of Pittsburgh's Gateway Service Center of Chinese Academic Journal
   Publications. The project implements the gateway model for global
   resource sharing, by bringing together several academic libraries from
   China, Taiwan and Hong Kong to establish a protocol of document
   delivery of Chinese journal publications for U.S. researchers.
   Challenged by distance, language, political climate and copyright
   issues, the project has been quite successful and has demonstrated
   that the necessary protocols, agreements and other complex
   negotiations required for global resource sharing are not impossible
   to establish. The Gateway Service Center of Chinese Academic Journal
   Publications may be accessed at http://www.library.pitt.edu/gateway/.

   Project" RLG DigiNews 3(6) (December 15, 1999)
   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews3-6.html#feature). - Much
   of the most practical digital library developments are coming from
   Europe, and a case in point is the project described in this report.
   The LAURIN project (http://laurin.uibk.ac.at/) of the European
   Commission (launched in 1998) brings together seventeen partners from
   seven European countries to develop an infrastructure to support the
   digitization and management of newspaper clippings. One of the
   outcomes of the project has been the development of libClip, a
   software application that semi-automates the process of digizitizing a
   particular clipping, analyzing the article layout, recognizing the
   characters on the page (OCR), and metadata capture. The development of
   this software dramatically increases the efficiency of this type of
   procedure. They promise that a full trial version of the software will
   be available at their web site by the time this issue of Current Cites
   is published. - RT
