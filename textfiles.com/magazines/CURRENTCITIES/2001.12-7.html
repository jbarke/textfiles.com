   Allen, Maryellen M. [9]"Bluetooth Bites Information Retrieval
   [10]Online 25(3) (May 2001)
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2001/allen5_01.html). -
   Futurists and sci-fi buffs have long envisaged a world of wireless
   communication through a small portable device, be it a watch or gadget
   loaded special eyewear. A new enabling technology standard which has
   the potential to make this vision a reality is Bluetooth. Maryellen
   Mott Allen's article is an excellent introduction to both the
   underlying technology, and and its applications for libraries and
   librarians. She begins the article by citing market studies which
   demonstrate an exploding market for Bluetooth enabled devices. Tracing
   the history and technological construct of Bluetooth in layman's
   language, she kindles the reader's curiosity for further
   investigation. To this end it is best to start at the [11]Official
   Bluetooth SiG website (http://www.bluetooth.com). Named after Harald
   Bluetooth, the son of Denmark's first king, Bluetooth is an open data
   transmission standard developed by Ericsson. A who's who of hi-tech
   companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, Nokia, Toshiba, etc. now form the
   Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which is committed to developing low
   power, high speed, short range devices compatible with the Bluetooth
   data transfer standard. The benefits of interactive wireless are
   boundless. Imagine connecting to remote database servers, accessing
   information resources on various platforms, creating ad hoc working
   groups where data is instantly shared, anywhere and everywhere. There
   are, however, problems which have to be addressed. These include
   security issues, and device incompatibility from competing
   technologies such as the one defined in IEEE 802.11b. The
   communications revolutions continues -- stay tuned. - [12]MG
   
   Carlson, Scott. [13]"JSTOR's Journal-Archiving Service Makes Fans of
   Librarians and Scholars" [14]Chronicle of Higher Education 47(46)
   (July 27, 2001): A26-A28
   (http://www.chronicle.com/free/v47/i46/46a02601.htm). - This overview
   of JSTOR, the non-profit digital archiving project, could almost have
   been written by the project's own PR department. It seems there's not
   much bad you can say about an organization whose mission is to
   "preserve and maintain journal literature, and to make that material
   more accessible" and who -- in this time of dot.com excess and greed
   -- are not only turning a blind eye to profit but have even offered
   rebates to early subscribers who bought into JSTOR when the costs were
   higher. Criticisms of JSTOR -- that smaller institutions can't afford
   to subscribe and that building a digital archive only encourages
   libraries to trash their print back runs -- do not, in this citer's
   opinion, hold up against the advantages. Think about it: you can
   search the full-text of an entire run of an important scholarly
   journal from home. Besides, how many organizations do you know that
   can gain the respect of both librarians and publishers? - [15]MP
   
   Case, Mary M. [16]"Public access to scientific information: Are 22,700
   scientists wrong?" [17]C&RL News 62(7) (July/August 2001):
   706-709,716. (http://www.ala.org/acrl/case.html) - Close to
   twenty-three thousand and counting -- that's the number of scientists
   who've signed the open letter available at the [18]Public Library of
   Science site pledging to only publish in journals that make the
   articles freely available to the public six months after their initial
   publication. When Current Cites last reported on this in [19]April
   2001, the number of scientists who had signed was 15,000. In this
   article by Mary M. Case, we are given some more background information
   on the initiative as well as suggestions for how librarians can do
   their bit. - [20]LRK
   
   [21]Free Online Scholarship Newsletter
   (http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/). - [22]Peter Suber, chair of the
   Philosophy Department at Earlham College, established the electronic
   Free Online Scholarship Newsletter in March of this year. This
   newsletter, which is distributed via a Topica mailing list, is an
   excellent way to stay informed about current scholarly electronic
   publishing developments. Suber makes no bones about his position in
   the ongoing debate about the economics of scholarly electronic
   publishing: he wants it to be subsidized and free to users. He also
   wants it to be uncensored. Even if you don't agree with these
   positions, you are likely to find the newsletter to be a valuable, if
   provocative, source of information. If you don't want to subscribe to
   the mailing list, read the Web-based [23]issue archive periodically.
   There is also a [24]discussion forum. And, of course, it's all free.-

   Galbi, Douglas A. [26]"Some Economics of Personal Activity and
   Implications for the Digital Economy" [27]First Monday 6(7) (July 2,
   2001) (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_7/galbi/). - The
   author places the "buzz" about the "attention economy" in a very
   useful historical context. He charts economic study of personal
   attention to media from 1925 to the present, assessing user behavior
   long before anyone every heard of the Web. However, some important
   historical facts from this longer period emerge. First, increases in
   personal time spent with media follow increases in total personal
   discretionary time. Second, the share of advertising spending in total
   economic output is more or less constant. Third, advertising spending
   per person-hour spent with media has also been roughly constant. The
   upshot, Galbi argues, is that the traditional approach of buying
   personal attention through media advertising will not support the
   extremely rapid growth of the digital economy. Instead, the growth of
   the digital economy is more likely to be driven by the growth of
   discretionary time and integration of digital technology into new
   forms of socializing. - [28]TH
   
   Holden, Stephen H., ed. "A Symposium on International Applications of
   Electronic Government (E-Government): Research, Practice and Issues"
   Government Information Quarterly 18(2) (2001). - The editor of this
   symposium issue thinks that 'e-government' might be the management
   reform buzzword of the new century. There's certainly a lot of
   pressure to achieve, or at least be perceived as achieving, this type
   of governmental weight-loss; public opinion has the 'e' standing for
   'efficient' and just wants to see the bloat reduced. The articles here
   are a smorgasbord of ways to think about, implement, and last but not
   least, watchdog e-government projects. The availability of online
   state legislative information is analyzed in an article that assesses
   progress in access, usability and search features. Canadian efforts
   are described in a report that focuses on the difficulty of changing
   administrative culture (and gives us the "International" in the title
   -- otherwise, the focus is pretty domestic). The US Dept. of Energy's
   Office of Scientific and Technological Information has, not
   unexpectedly, been a leader in the electronic dissemination of
   research results; their successes are related in a study that
   quantifies the activity around their [29]primary website. On a more
   theoretical level, there's an article laying out a four-stage model
   for e-gov projects which can effectively 'cut across the silos' of
   vertically arranged information repositories. Finally, there's a
   critique of the study by the US National Commission on Libraries and
   Information Science, [30]"A Comprehensive Assessment of Public
   Information Dissemination: Final Report, Vol. 1" which finds that its
   recommendations could perpetuate technologically obsolete mechanisms,
   and provide no reasonable model for electronic archives. - JR

   9, 2001)
   (http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/preservation010708.h
   tml) - Too many people believe that backing their electronic data up
   to tape, CDs, etc. is a safe way of preserving it for the long haul.
   Alas, these media seem to deteriorate even faster than paper, and data
   stored on them "requires frequent conversion from old storage media,
   like computer disks and magnetic tapes, to newer ones." The author
   talks to Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive
   (http://www.archive.org/) and some other digital preservation experts
   such as Ken Thibodeau, director of the electronic records archives
   program at the National Archive (http://www.nara.gov/). Article
   includes links to related stories and more detailed information. -

   This article explores the dark side of "AOL's evolution into one of
   America's most popular news outlets." Substantive objective journalism
   providing coverage of hard news and public affairs is scarce, despite
   the fact that AOL now has any number of Time, Inc.'s impressive stable
   of magazines from which to pull content. Alas, pandering to the lowest
   common denominator attracts more eyeballs and advertising dollars. The
   author is especially pessimistic about what will happen as AOL extends
   its brand into interactive and cable television. - [36]SK

   (CIPA)" [38]First Monday 6(7) (July 2, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_7/latham/). - The author
   argues that the public library in the United States today is an
   essential avenue for the development of debate on the entire range of
   topics that face the society: political, social, economic, and
   recreational. She explores the ramifications and impact of the
   controversy over the Children's Internet Protection Act, on the
   library in general, and on the relationship between patron and
   librarian. She argues that in order to fulfill its role the public
   library must be immune to the imposition of any particular orthodoxy
   of belief. The Children's Internet Protection Act is the most concrete
   challenge to the library as a marketplace for ideas and the primacy of
   the citizen's right to research, and offers the profession a new
   opportunity to redefine itself as a guardian of the public good that
   stands above orthodoxy. - [39]TH

   Among the fallout from the great dot-com debacle is that many useful
   free services have dried up and blown away. Oddly enough, freebie
   voice portals seem to be thriving. If you're on the road or otherwise
   away from a computer, you can dial up a popular portal -- MSN, Yahoo!,
   etc. -- and get your news, sports scores, stock quotes, soap opera
   updates, whatever. Even more useful, travelers can obtain
   up-to-the-minute airline arrival and departure information, traffic
   reports, and driving directions. Some of these portals will even read
   your e-mail to you. [42]SK

   Jared Spool, Founding Principal of User Interface Engineering"
   [44]WebWord.com (July 25, 2001)
   (http://webword.com/interviews/spool2.html). - The state of usability
   by one of its foremost practitioners is what we're served up in this
   interview with Jared Spool, author of the classic "Web Site Usability
   : A Designer's Guide." Spool sees a welcomed shift in emphasis in this
   field from "preachers of a religion of sorts" to "researchers of best
   practices". He also points out that usable sites depend not so much on
   having a stable of usability experts on hand but rather on developing
   a "culture" of usability in-house. The results of his research -- much
   of it concerning e-commerce -- can apply, he feels, to "non e-commerce
   sites" as well. - [45]LRK

   - Even if you've never heard of GNOME -- the open-source effort to
   provide a user-friendly interface for Linux -- you might be interested
   in this study conducted by the usability team over at Sun Microsystems
   (http://www.sun.com/usability/). It goes over the kind of problems
   users ran into while trying to solve various "tasks". In turn, the
   study offers solutions -- some of which you may agree with or not.
   Graphics clearly show the state of the interface now and how suggested
   improvements can be made. Independent of the subject matter then, this
   is a clear and instructive example of usability in action. - [47]LRK
   
   Spink, Amanda, and Gunar, Okan. [48]"E-commerce web queries: Excite
   and Ask Jeeves Study" [49]First Monday 6(7) (July 2, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_7/spink/). - The authors
   report on a study of business related queries submitted to the
   [50]Excite and [51]Ask Jeeves Web search services. They sampled a log
   of 10,000 Excite queries and 10,000 Ask Jeeves question format
   queries, and make a few conclusions about the oh-so-organic process of
   research. First, business queries often include more search terms,
   lead to fewer Web pages viewed, and include fewer advanced search
   features than non-business queries. Second, company or product queries
   were the most common form of business query; and third, Ask Jeeves
   business queries in question form were largely limited to the format
   "Where can I buy..." or the request "I want to buy ...". Librarians
   will be shocked to find out that business terminology and the open Web
   are not standardized and make the process very difficult for the
   average user. Maybe that's not news to many of us, but it supports the
   case for better analysis tools that can track the formulation of
   questions. Interesting tabulations of search strategies are another
   highlight to be found here. - [52]TH

   Lawyers, apparently, are lurking in every corner of cyberspace.
   Sullivan keeps an ongoing annotated collection of links to articles
   about various search engine-related lawsuits in a number of
   categories: advertising, crawling and linking, domain names,
   government regulation, labor, meta tags, meta search, multimedia
   search, pagejacking, patents, privacy and user information and

   - While it's not news to most information professionals, Tweney
   maintains that "too many sites are weighted down by graphics and Flash
   animations." He gives some examples of "good" and "bad" pages, and
   includes Jupiter Media Matrix's recommendation that Web pages should
   "weigh" no more than 40 or 50 KB. These will take 8-10 seconds to
   download over a typical 56K connection -- "about the limit of most
   people's patience." He also reminds Web page designers than an
   increasing number of people are accessing sites via very slow wireless
   connections on devices with small screens. - [58]SK
   
   White, Martin. "Behind the Firewall: A Case for Formal Intranet
   Leadership" [59]Econtent 24(5) (July 2001). - Martin White, managing
   director of a U.K. intranet consulting company makes a compelling case
   for sophisticated expertise in the management of intranets. Oh the
   plight of the intranet webmaster, isolated behind corporate firewalls!
   There is little or no chance to glean tips and tricks from competitor
   or client intranet sites. This is in marked contrast to the internet
   webmaster who can surf the web for ideas. Often managing an intranet
   is a peripheral task for already preoccupied librarians and
   information specialists. Furthermore, usually there is no budget for
   intranet activity. Mr. White envisages the intranet webmaster as a
   vice president/director of intranet operations. The required skills
   are a complex  mix of information technology savvy, knowledge of web
   design principles, excellent communication skills, the ability to
   build teams, and what could be called "information content
   architecture." As intranets are becoming the primary corporate tool
   for information transfer and sharing, certainly recognition of the
   intranet webmaster, appropriate funding, and higher visibility are a
   must. - [60]MG
