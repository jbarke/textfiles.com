   _Editor's Note:_ This month we are pleased to welcome two new
   contributors: Christof Galli and Kirk Hastings. Christof received
   M.L.I.S and M.A. degrees in 1996 from UC Berkeley, and has accumulated
   an impressive HTML portfolio here at the UC Berkeley Library. No
   slouch himself, Kirk has an impressive array of accomplishments that
   includes the Jack London Collection on the Digital Library SunSITE
   (home of Current Cites). Kirk will receive his M.L.I.S this year from
   San Jose State University. This month we are also adding a new
   section, "Digital Libraries" in recognition of the fact that
   increasingly articles that we cite do not go gracefully into other
   categories. Besides, our fearless editor is on maternity leave at the
   moment (Mom and baby doing fine, thank you) and I am free to run
   rampant. - _Roy Tennant, Acting Editor_

   Roberts. "Integrating Structured Data and Text: A Relational Approach"
   Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48(2)
   (February 1997):122-132. -- Making large collections of text available
   over the Internet through a rich, interactive search environment is
   the goal of many of the most ambitious digital library projects.
   Unfortunately, this usually involves the use of complex and expensive
   special purpose IR systems. The authors of this article offer an
   approach using the relational database model integrating structured
   data and unstructured text that has a lot of promising features.
   Primary among these is that it can be implemented with a
   straightforward relational database, which many institutions already
   have in place. Using standard SQL their system makes it possible to do
   Boolean keyword searches, proximity searches and relevance ranking on
   a full-text database. Although the storage overhead of such an
   approach is about three times that of an advanced IR systems, run time
   results compare very favorably, and with the rapid descent in the
   price of storage it seems very viable. -- KH
   
   Jones, Paul "Java and Libraries: Digital and Otherwise" D-Lib Magazine
   (March 1997) [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march97/03jones.html]. Jones
   intro duces Java, discusses some of its possible uses, and points to
   specific projects and resources. Since many of us have already heard
   plenty about the promises of Java, the real benefit of this article is
   in the specific examples of how Java can be an effec tive tool for
   advancing scholarship. - RT

   Library (NVL)" D-Lib Magazine (March 1997)
   [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march97/navy/03norris.html]. In this
   inspirationa l article, Norris and Duncan describe how adversity
   brought on by Navy downsizing spurred them to build an innovative and
   effective interface to online databases. Although the technical
   details on how the system was implemented are lacking (for example, "
   software was written to..."), the screen shots and other diagrams help
   sketch out how the system works for its users. If it truly works as
   advertised, it may provide an interesting model for other projects.
   They also use this specific project as a launch pad for speculating on
   how librarians can simultaneous cope with less resources and yet
   improve service. - RT
   
   "Resource Sharing in a Changing Environment" Library Trends 45(3)
   (Winter 1997). With the emergence of electronic catalogs and the
   Internet along with changes in the nature of access to
   commercially-produced resources, we must radically rethink our
   assumptions about library services and resource sharing. This entire
   issue of Library Trends focuses on resource sharing in a changing
   library environment. Among the 12 articles included is one by Edward
   Shreeves who questions the relevance of cooperative collection which
   are based on print model even though we have already entered the
   digital age. John Barnes writes that despite changes in technology,
   libraries need to maintain their role in collecting, accessing and
   archiving information. Czeslaw Jan Grycz explores the broader context
   of scholarly communication and surveys sometimes divergent attitudes
   of authors, publishers and librarians. There are also articles on
   interlibrary loan, commercial document delivery services, and union
   catalogs. -MP

   Judith R. Davis. "How to Improve DBMSes" BYTE 22:4 (April
   1997):109-120. -- This pair of articles offers a very understandable
   explanation of the directions database management systems have
   recently taken and are likely to take in the future. The need to
   incorporate complex data formats and to accommodate new ways of
   processing data has led to the development of object-relational
   databases and DataBlades. A DataBlade is a package that allows the
   user to plug in a set of data types and processes that deals with such
   previously difficult data forms as images, full-text documents and
   spatial data. While powerful, the author of the first article feels
   that object-relational databases are merely a cobbled-together
   solution that will serve as a stepping stone to a much more integrated
   approach. This is a theme which the authors of the second article pick
   up and illustrate by describing what they feel are the seven essential
   requirements of any future system that is developed specifically for
   complex data. -- KH 
   
  Electronic Publishing
  
   Cox, Richard J. "Taking Sides on the Future of the Book" American
   Libraries 28(2) (February 1997): 52-55. - Using several recent books
   as point and counterpoint, Cox reviews the issues regarding print and
   electronic publishing and what it may mean for the future of the book.
   Being a library school professor, his interest lies largely in what he
   should be teaching to the next generation of information
   professionals. His musings are interesting and his conclusion
   compelling. From the librari an's perspective, he concludes, "whether
   the book is a physical object or electronic shadow is almost beside
   the point. The real matter is that we understand, regardless of what
   may replace the book, the nature of information and knowledge in our
   society. " So much of the debate on the future of the book seems to
   get bogged down in debating the format of the package and what impact
   that format will have on our jobs that hearing such an enlightened
   perspective is truly refreshing. - RT

   This interview of the Editor-in-Chief of Encyclopaedia Britannica
   brings into focus a number of issues that traditional publishers face
   in making the transition to a mixed prin t/electronic market. As the
   interview unfolds, it seems apparent why Britannica Online is gaining
   a good foothold on the electronic market. They understand the market
   and their product's place in it. - RT

   Barrett, Daniel J. NetResearch: Finding Information Online.
   Sebastopol, CA: Songline Studios, 1997. In thi s slim volume Barrett
   packs a lot of advice about how to effectively search the net. For the
   target audience of the novice net user (a couple chapters are
   dedicated to answering typical "newbie" questions about the net), this
   book will likely be an essent ial guide to net searching. As in other
   O'Reilly books, boxes containing brief "real-life" comments from a
   selected group of experienced Internet users gives insight into how
   one can incorporate advice from the book into their day-to-day work.
   But I must also point out an omission. Although Barrett begins with
   some good overall advice and warnings, he misses an essential caveat
   -- that the Internet does not yet, nor will it ever have, all
   available information. His readers should be reminded to check with
   their local librarian (which increasingly they can do easier by email
   than in person) to get the full picture of what is available
   (including Internet resources). Even given that drawback, however, the
   book has advice that can help even experienced users, and it will be
   particularly helpful to those new to net searching. - RT
   
   Battenfeld, Robert L. and B. Kenton Temple. "Environmental Resources
   on the Internet" College & Research Library News 58(3) (March 1997):
   153-157. Many environmental organizations, as well as science and
   governmental environmental groups, have discovered that the Internet
   is a powerful tool for communicating and distributing information.
   This is a representative list of some of those Internet resources that
   the authors found to be most useful and interesting. In addition to
   general sources like Envirolink (http://www.envirolink.org/), the
   articles lists electronic journals and organizational homepages as
   well as sites that focus on specific environmental issues like energy
   or waste disposal. - MP "The Internet: Fulfilling the Promise"

   Scientific American Special Report.
   [http://www.sciam.com/0397issue/0397intro.html]. This special
   collection of eight articles on the Internet brings together an inte
   resting group of experts to summarize the past, describe the present
   and speculate about the future of the Internet. Included are articles
   by Clifford Lynch: "Searching the Internet", Michael Les k: "Going
   Digital", Paul Resnick: "Filtering Information on the Internet",
   Hearst, Marti A.: "Interfaces for Searching the Web", Raman, T.V.:
   "WebSurfing Without a Monitor", Oudet, Bruno: "Multilingualism on the
   Internet", Stefik, Mark: "Trusted Systems", and Kahle, Brewster:
   "Preserving the Internet". Although the brevity of the articles does
   not leave much room for anything but a suc cinct overview of the
   issues and a small set of examples, the collection can serve as a good
   tutorial on some of the issues facing present Internet users and
   researchers. - RT
   
   Jaffe, Lee David. All About Internet Mail (Internet Workshop Series
   Number 7) Berkeley, California: Library Solutions Press, 1997. While
   it could be argued that a book about electronic mail falls outside of
   the scope of the librarian, it could also be argued that email -- as a
   means scholarly communication and information sharing -- is very much
   part of the librarian¹s domain. Whatever your opinion on this issue,
   the fact is we all use it and in some cases we may be called upon to
   teach others how to use it. This book (number 7 in the Internet
   Workshop Series published by Library Solutions Press), can serve the
   needs of two different types of readers: the individual who knows
   nothing about email can go through the workbook lessons and by the end
   be a competent email user; a trainer may also use this book as a model
   on which to base similar workshops. In both cases, the workbook
   provides a broad overview while at the same time covering specific
   details and functions of email. Particularly useful in this book is
   the module on Internet culture and the social aspects of email and how
   to find email addresses. - MP
   
   Patrick, Chuck. "Internet vs. Intranet". UNIX Review 15(3) (March
   1997): 37-44. Intranets have become increasingly popular in the
   corporate environment because they offer inexpensive, easy-to-use data
   access environments which are platform independent. They are defined
   as company-internal networks using Internet communications hardware
   and software and restricting communication with the Internet. The
   present article examines the differences between intranet and Internet
   network computing developments. It posits that centrally controlled
   corporate intranets will lead the way in developing new applications
   and infrastructures because of their owners' vested interest in
   effectively creating, distributing, and controlling information.
   Developments on the Internet, on the other hand, are lagging behind
   and will depend on advances made in intranet infrastructure
   development. Contrasting the characteristics of Internet and intranet
   content, Patrick notes that, whereas Internet content is largely
   static, designed to please, and is not sensitive, intranet content can
   be sensitive or even confidential, is more dynamic, and focuses on
   productivity and information exchange. Comparing information delivery,
   he states that network performance (bandwidth), GUI components,
   platform inadequacies, and interactivity further set intranets apart
   from the Internet. The author concludes that a centrally formulated
   corporate information policy constitutes an advantage over the
   Internet's unregulated structure and allows for more rapid development
   of networking tools. The article provides a good overview of what an
   intranet is and the issues involved in creating and maintaining one. -

   Rudenstine, Neil L. "The Internet and education: A close fit."
   Chronicle of Higher Education 63 (24) (February 21, 1997):A48. The
   president of Harvard University places the potential of the Internet
   in the same historical context as the explosion of print media--he
   quotes Diderot, who said, "The world of learning will drown in books."
   However, the meat of this opinion piece (which is thoroughly
   engrossing) lies President Rudenstine's recognition of the
   transformative potential of networked information on education. He
   sees a strong--even vital--linkage between the research library and
   electronic media; the emergence of "conversational learning" via the
   network; and the dramatic enrichment of course materials that enrich
   classroom teaching. - TH
   
   Wilson, David O. "Students popular internet sites slow campus networks
   to a crawl". Chronicle of Higher Education 63(25) (Feburary 28,
   1997):A26. Campus servers have long been prey to the sudden popularity
   of student web pages. Because most servers are used for a wide variety
   of uses, including real work, trying to tame this tiger can pose a
   problem for IT managers. Still, most campus computing departments have
   neither the funds nor the inclination to monitor student activity,
   some of which may even be germane to their studies. In essence, campus
   computer use policies may seem restrictive, but they are rarely
   enforced. One possible preemptive strategy: make friends with your
   sysadmin. - TH

   Guernsey, Lisa. "Video technology transforms the teaching of art

   1997):A20-23. This article describes recent developments at Columbia
   University's Media Center for Art History. Faculty member Stephen
   Murray is using multimedia technology to teach history of
   architecture, with stunning results. This article includes a two-page
   spread of photographs of Amiens Cathedral, which students can navigate
   through in three dimensions. Although this approach is similar in
   appearance to advanced Computer Automated Design (CAD/CAM), it
   combines animation with design to enhance the quality of the learning
   experience. - TH

   [http://www.onlineinc.com/emedia/JanEM/parker1.html] Is competition
   for slots on your library's CD-ROM tower turning into a management
   issue? Well, relief might be on the horizon in the form of DVD
   (Digital Video Disk) technology. This new technology is capable of
   delivering the contents of seven 650 MB CD-ROM disks on one 4.7 GB, 12
   cm, single layer DVD-ROM disk. On a four-layer disk, up to 17GB of
   data can be stored. From the point of view of prospective DVD
   publishers, the present article provides an overview of the ISO 9660
   and Micro UDF (Universal Disk Format) software which is able to handle
   the increased mass of data presented in a single volume, examines
   emerging DVD-ROM production services, and discusses strategies for
   publishers to entice users to migrate from widely used CD-ROM to the
   new DVD-ROM. The article concludes that despite the current lack of
   mature products and final technical specifications and the existence
   of an installed base of 100 million CD-ROM drives, reduced hardware
   requirements for accessing larger amounts of data will allow
   publisher[s to] transfer loyalty from CD-ROM to DVD-ROM[...] . - CG
