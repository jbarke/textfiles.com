   Editor's Note: WIth this issue, we lament the retirement from Current
   Cites of our Editor of six years, Teri Andrews Rinne, and also
   celebrate ten years of continuous monthly publication. Teri was one of
   the original six contributors to Current Cites, and remained with the
   publication since it's inception, except for maternity leave. She
   guided us through a period of growth and solidification as a
   thoughtful, critical, and down-to-earth review of the best that we
   could find in information technology literature. She will be sorely
   missed, but we wish her well in her new endeavors.
   
   Over the past ten years we have strived to fulfill our vision of a
   current awareness publication that helps busy professionals focus on
   the best information technology literature. Our sources include
   popular magazines, peer-reviewed journals, books, and web sites. We
   don't guarantee complete coverage of everything that you may find
   interesting, but what we do feature here are some of the best, most
   current sources we have found. We do not shrink from being
   opinionated, nor from comparing one source to another. Our database of
   citations now numbers over 1,000, and is searchable at
   [7]http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CurrentCites/bibondemand.cgi. We call
   this service "Bibliography on Demand" because it can be easily used to
   create printable or linkable bibliographies on information technology
   topics. Another service we offer is full-text searching of all cited
   articles that are freely available in full-text. To provide this
   service, we "crawl" the remote articles and index them using Harvest.
   You can try it out at
   [8]http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CurrentCites/articlesearch.html. Please
   do not hesitate to let us know how else we can improve Current Cites
   so it can better serve your current awareness needs. Thanks! -- Roy,
   for the Cites crew

   Belkin, Nicholas J. [9]"Helping People Find What They Don't Know"
   [10]Communications of the ACM 43(8) (August 2000):58-61
   (http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/journals/cacm/2000-43-8/p58-belkin/p
   58-belkin.pdf). - When we read about efforts to increase the
   responsiveness of computer systems to their users, it's usually the
   flashier stuff that gets put in bold face, like the MIT Media Lab's
   efforts to sharpen the computer's senses through cameras for vision,
   microphones for hearing, increased touch sensitivity, etc. But no
   matter how 'sensory' systems may become, language is still going to be
   the primary human/computer interface for information exchange.
   Projects which attempt to refine the exchange so that a shared
   vocabulary achieves optimum understanding are always of interest to
   information providers. This article is about a Rutgers research group
   which is developing recommendation systems which allow a program to
   reply to a query with a helpful set of suggestions, focusing on the
   choice of terms to be used to achieve the desired result. The author
   describes their efforts to go beyond relevance feedback, which allows
   the user to rank relevance but does not promote user understanding and
   customization of the process itself. An alternative, term suggestion
   devices, could promote greater precision, and also, as the title
   suggests, help the user find out whatever he or she doesn't know which
   is relevant to the query. The group appears to be paying as much
   attention to human behavior as syntax and thesauri, as they have
   examined the features of such systems which could sidetrack users and
   cause them to ultimately lose confidence in the interaction, at which
   point the system would have to be called a failure. - JR

   [12]First Monday 5(7) (July 3rd, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_7/cooper/). - Like so many
   other articles published by First Monday, this one draws on familiar
   metaphors to describe the promises and pitfalls of our cyber-futures.
   Excessive eloquence comes with the territory, but in this case the
   analysis is first rate and provocative. In the describing the new
   "boundlessness" of the Internet, the author identifies several
   quintessentially "American" traits, like self-reliance and
   risk-taking. He also argues that surging Internet stocks do not a
   South Seas Bubble make. This sunny forecast can be found among stock
   analysts and futurists in ample supply, but this article takes a
   closer look at history as an indicator of what might evolve on the
   Internet. - [13]TH

   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews4-4.html#feature1). -
   [16]JSTOR is an innovative project to centrally archive journal
   literature on behalf of libraries. In this interesting interview with
   RLG DigiNews, the director explains the mission of JSTOR and the
   strategy they are using to fulfill that mission. Guthrie details five
   primary components: 1) Technological approach, 2) Preservation and
   back-up plans, 3) Relationships with content providers, 4)
   Relationships with users/libraries, and 5) An economic model with a
   reasonable probability of reaching self-sufficiency. - [17]RT

   22, 2000) (http://www.chronicle.com/free/2000/08/2000082201t.htm). -
   This article explores recent developments in Web-based pre-prints of
   chemistry articles, focussing on remarks made by librarians at a
   meeting of the American Chemical Society. Elsevier Science has
   unveiled a new Web site that posts preprint articles and enables
   readers to form online discussion groups addressing the research
   presented in each paper. Librarians argue that the American Chemical
   Society's reticence in starting their own site places the scholarly
   debate about the merits of new research in a commercial sphere. They
   further argue that managing the discourse about new research is best
   left in the hands of the society, since it may be difficult to
   identify truly important new research among the vast offerings that
   will like appear on pre-print servers of this nature. - [20]TH

   Times Technology Circuits
   (July 26, 2000)
   (http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/circuits/articles/27libr.ht
   ml). - The Library of Congress' digital preparedness is at issue in a
   260-page report released last month by the National Academy of
   Sciences. Report Committee Chairman James O'Donnell cites inadequate
   infrastructure and lack of strategic planning, coupled with the need
   to work collaboratively with other large institutions, whether other
   libraries or private funding institutions such as the National Digital
   Library Program. With the help of the latter, the library's
   [23]American Memory site (http://memory.loc.gov/) has mounted some 5
   million of its 119 million items on the web. But the race to preserve
   America's cultural heritage of the past decade or so, appears to have
   come down to an either/or situation: between digitizing extant analog
   material such as posters and baseball cards, and the archiving and
   preservation of emerging digital artifacts, such as CD-ROMs, digital
   images, and websites, themselves. - [24]LM

   [26]New York Times Technology Circuits (August 10, 2000).
   (http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/08/circuits/articles/10thin.ht
   ml). - Leibovich tracks a disturbing trend amongst students who are
   increasingly avoiding traditional library research methods altogether
   for the quick fix of web search engines. But inevitably, Leibovich
   asserts, what they believe they will gain in reduced exertion is often
   lost in bad search practices. UC Berkeley's own Ellen Meltzer
   corroborates, adding that the problem extends to college-age searchers
   who are often deficient in the finer points of boolean logic or
   controlled vocabulary. Most of the librarians and educators quoted
   cite a pressing need for teaching new research methodologies to
   optimize the use of the web for research. The paradigm of a solitary
   web surfer who does online research from his/her dorm room or bedroom
   without availing him/herself of the guidance of educational
   professionals is one worm in a whole can. Is the library slated to
   become an internet hub, merely, where young minds will at least find
   some guidance in the form of a librarian? In my mind, at least, the
   question remains: how can we make the internet a research supplement
   for young people rather than a perceived replacement? - [27]LM
   
   Mann, Charles C. [28]"The Heavenly Jukebox" [29]The Atlantic Monthly
   286(3) (September 2000) p.39-59 (http://www.theatlantic.com/jukebox/).
   - Napster has been receiving a lot of press coverage lately, for
   making it possible for millions of Internet users to ignore copyright
   by trading digital music files. If this was only an issue of
   importance to the music industry and music consumers, it would still
   be an interesting and important one. But it is much, much bigger than
   that. There is a great deal more at stake here, and Mann does a better
   job than anyone I've seen at uncovering the issues, the players, and
   even the historical context. If you want to know what all the fuss is
   about (and we haven't seen anything yet), then this article will get
   you up-to-speed faster and better than most. Mann asserts that the
   music industry (and perhaps the movie and publishing industries to
   follow) have only two possible courses of action in the face of
   Napster, Gnutella, and other peer-to-peer applications: 1) "prepare
   for a world in which copyright plays a much smaller role", or 2)
   "change the Internet. The first alternative is problematic, to say the
   least. The second could be much worse." If you don't think it's
   possible that we could be on the verge of a post-copyright world, you
   should check out [30]Gnutella. Unlike Napster, there are no
   responsible organizations, no central servers, no people to sue. You
   do the math. - [31]RT
   
   "Napster's wake-up call" [32]The Economist Vol. 355 (No.8176) (Jun 24,
   2000) p. 23-24 - Although it was written before current legal
   developments, this article presents the best synopsis of the
   technological, legal and cultural issues raised by Napster. In
   addition to describing the technology, it analyzes the intellectual
   property issues surrounding music file sharing, which pose a new
   ideological challenge to other information industries. It also
   recognizes the emerging cultural phenomenon of a file sharing
   community. - [33]TH

   (http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2619470,00.html). -
   It's clear Intel can't stand to be too far away from the Next Big
   Thing, since in the wake of Napster's popularity it has put together
   an industry peer-to-peer networking group of 18 companies, including
   IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Peer-to-peer networking (also called "P2P";
   see other cites on Napster in this issue of Current Cites) has
   skyrocketed into the popular press as a method for the masses of
   Internet users to share files (most notably illegal music cuts) with
   one another. But Intel and other industry leaders are more likely to
   see P2P as a method for corporate users to quickly and easily share
   information from behind a firewall. - [36]RT
   
   Wagner, Dirk Nicholas. [37]"Software agents take the Internet as a
   shortcut to enter society: A survey of new actors to study for social
   theory" [38]First Monday 5(7) (July 3rd, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_7/wagner/). The author
   argues that new perspectives on the social impact of technology are
   now vital. It makes sense to recast the social science of men [sic]
   and machines as men [sic] and agents. Agents operate as players in
   society, with substantial impact, and when society is inhabited by
   many different kinds of software agents, the effect is intensified.
   However, a general theory of multi-agent environments -- complex
   domains where people and software interact in new relationships -- is
   absent. Such a theory would substantially improve perceptions of
   person-machine interactions, and the power of the Internet to
   influence society. - [39]TH
