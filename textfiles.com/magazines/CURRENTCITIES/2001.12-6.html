   Bonett, Monica. [8]Personalization of Web Services: Opportunities and
   Challenges" [9]Ariadne Issue 28 (June 2001)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/personalization/). - Bonett begins
   by describing what personalization is and the purposes for offering
   personalization options for web sites. She uses commercial web sites
   to illustrate different kinds of personalization, then briefly
   discusses each specific method for providing personalization. In the
   third section she highlights library examples of web personalization,
   and finishes with a "challenges" section in which she outlines some
   thorny issues (such as usability and ethics) that must be addressed.
   The piece is illustrated with screen shot examples, all web site URLs
   are provided, and many of the bibliographic references are available
   online. - [10]RT
   
   Brabazon, Tara. [11]"Internet Teaching and the Administration of
   Knowledge" [12]First Monday 6(6) (June 4, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_6/brabazon/). - The author,
   an Australian, assesses the impact on the Internet on universities in
   a wide-ranging analysis that deconstructs the role of teachers,
   classrooms and pedagogy in general. She makes the interesting point
   that the "crisis" in university education purportedly triggered by the
   Internet coincides with a dramatic increase in the enrollment of women
   and minorities, including reentry students. Her analysis of the issues
   surrounding teacher performance and quality in the classroom are very
   well-stated, striking through the rhetoric surrounding attempts to do
   "corporate makeovers" in the academy. - [13]TH
   
   Bradford, Phillip G., Brown, Herbert E., and Saunders, Paula M.
   [14]"Pricing, Agents, Perceived Value and the Internet" [15]First
   Monday 6(6) (June 4, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_6/bradford/). - The authors
   make the powerful but simple point that however innovative the
   Internet is as a new delivery system for consumers, "perceived value"
   will always trump price in determining how much, and what people will
   want to buy. Dropping prices, of course, do have an impact on sales,
   but it only goes so far. People make purchase decisions based on
   value, and ultimately, value cannot be detached from commodity. This
   article provides a useful background in what many might think of as
   Economics 101. However, perhaps more e-commerce visionaries should
   thought about perceived value, in recent years. - [16]TH
   
   Freely, IP. [17]"Looking for a Job" [18]Netslaves
   (http://www.netslaves.com/comments/992865072.shtml). - One version of
   the dot-commer myth says that the young whippersnappers have always
   been free to cash out bigtime, and that the idle ones have no bigger
   worry than avoiding those little bits of croissant shrapnel on the
   caf'e chairs where they rest their golden-IPO'd butts. News to the
   contrary has spread fast: almost all of these newly unemployed people
   are hurting. If you're one of the many librarians who are wondering if
   they might be able to lure jobless programmers to their lower-paid but
   more secure library jobs, you might want to taste the bitterness and
   check out the "Netslaves: Undertakers of the New Economy" Web site.
   The cited article (a posting, really, complete with sassy pseudonym)
   is representative of what you can expect. Granted, at a site made for
   venting you will encounter rude language, but that's natural given the
   roller-coaster crash they've been through. Read about their sometimes
   absurd experiences (the item about all of those Aeron chairs
   [[19]http://www.netslaves.com/comments/989387319.shtml] bought with
   venture capital bucks), fears (how about homelessness), and
   generational humor (reader's poll: "When I go to hell I'll hear ...
   Ice, ice, baby"). The site was started by Bill Lessard and Steve
   Baldwin, authors of the book NetSlaves: True Tales of Working the Web,
   which was published way back last year before dot-com turned to
   dot-bomb. - JR
   
   Gill, Tony. [20]"3D Culture on the Web" [21]RLG DigiNews 5(3) (June
   15, 2001) (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews5-3.html). -
   Gill reminds us that the two-dimensional web is missing an important
   dimension. Particularly important for cultural information, the third
   dimension presents particular problems for depicting in a
   two-dimensional space. Gill reviews the ongoing standards efforts as
   well as existing applications for depicting and interacting with
   three-dimensional representations of landscapes or objects. Although
   we still seem to be some distance from achieving a robust, standard
   markup language for three-dimensional information (with the best hope
   being the XML-based X3D specification), at least you can experience
   3-D objects on the web through using such plug-ins as Apple Computer's
   QuickTime Virtual Reality (QuickTimeVR), which is available for both
   MS Windows and the Mac. - [22]RT
   
   Guglielmo, Connie. [23]"Microsoft Tries to Get Smart" [24]ZDnet
   Interactive iWeek (June 11, 2001)
   (http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/columns/0,4164,2772297,00.html).
   - Yuks of the month award goes to this delightful piece written in
   response to the controversy over Microsoft's proposed "Smart Tags".
   "Smart Tags" are 3rd party links to services, many of them commercial,
   which the next iteration of the Microsoft browser will automatically
   add to a Web page prior to display. The Guglielmo piece looks at the
   editorial implications of this in an especially well-crafted and
   understated way. - [25]LRK
   
   Hiltzik, Michael A. [26]"Birth of a Thinking Machine" [27]The Los
   Angeles Times (June 21, 2001)
   (http://www.latimes.com/business/cutting/lat_cyc010621.htm). - With
   the imminent release of Steven Spielberg's movie [28]A.I. (artificial
   intelligence), this article describes a real A.I. project. For 17
   years a team of scientists has been laboring to "teach" a computer
   (nick-named "Cyc" for "encyclopedia") everything it might need to know
   to think for itself. The "knowledge base" has grown to over 1.4
   million assertions, "hundreds of thousands of root words, names,
   descriptions, abstract concepts, and a method of making inferences
   that allows the system to understand that, for example, a piece of
   wood can be smashed into smaller pieces of wood, but a table can't be
   smashed into a pile of smaller tables." That's small comfort to those
   of us who remember all too well the fictional computer "HAL" from
   Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Although Cyc is still likely
   years from being used in practical applications, a small portion of
   the Cyc knowledge base is scheduled to be released to the public this
   summer under the name OpenCyc by [29]Cycorp, Cyc's inevitable
   corporate parent. - [30]RT
   
   Kennedy, Shirley Duglin. [31]"Web Design That Won't Get You Into
   Trouble" [32]Computers in Libraries 21 (6), June 2001.
   http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/jun01/kennedy.htm). - Ms. Kennedy has
   written a lively, thorough and thought provoking article about the
   many ways web designers can unwittingly break the law. The article
   could easily have been subtitled "Copyright, how do I infringe thee,
   let me count the ways" (my apologies to R.B.). The author lists the
   five rights granted by the Act to holders of copyright, Against this
   list, she demonstrates how seemingly innocent acts such as linking to
   a graphic on another's site may infringe copyright. Best to contact
   the owner, and ask for permission before going ahead. Further examples
   include creating a webpage of links to only selected portions of a
   website, and deep linking. The latter refers to bypassing the home
   page, and linking further into the website. Often home pages contain
   advertising, thus avoiding these may mean lost revenue for the
   website's owner. Further in the article, Ms Kennedy examines first
   amendment issues. Throughout the article there are numerous URLs
   presented, including a sidebar where all URLs in the article are
   compiled and annotated. - [33]MG
   
   Lynch, Clifford. [34]"The Battle to Define the Future of the Book in
   the Digital World" [35]First Monday 6(6) (June 4, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_6/lynch/). - This sprawling
   article lays out all of the issues driving the e-book development
   process, complete with a lively and entertaining panoply of the
   qualities one always associates with Clifford Lynch: humor, laconic
   delivery, far-reaching conclusions, piercing questions, and an
   intellect that cuts to the chase like a stiletto. Look no further for
   a lucid analysis of e-book readers versus software, licensing to
   consumers versus libraries, the role of libraries and their confusion
   with e-books, the successes of libraries with electronic media versus
   the lost opportunities, and so on. Lynch has always been a leader of
   the pack in assessing the human impact of technology without
   sacrificing a rigorous review of the technology. In short, this
   article is required reading for anyone interested in e-books. The
   section on libraries and e-books is a true gem - [36]TH
   
   Powell, Andy. [37]"OpenResolver: A Simple OpenURL Resolver"
   [38]Ariadne Issue 28 (June 2001)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/resolver/). - [39]OpenURL is a
   standard way to encode links for bibliographic resources that enables
   richer linking services than is normally possible. It is designed to
   solve one problem (the issue of sending the user to the copy of an
   item you've licensed rather than to one you have not, also called the
   "appropriate copy" problem) and provide opportunities for adding other
   linking services (such as looking up other articles by the same
   author). You'll need to read the piece to get the explanation of what
   it does and how it works. The online demonstration, however, is where
   you're more likely to "get it", so be sure to try it out. Kudos to
   Powell for writing a clear explanation of OpenURL and particularly for
   setting up such a great demonstration of how OpenURL works. - [40]RT
   
   Reich, Vicky and David S.H. Rosenthal. [41]"LOCKSS: A Permanent Web
   Publishing and Access System" [42]D-Lib Magazine 7(6) (June 2001)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june01/reich/06reich.html). - It's all too
   easy to scoff at a digital preservation system named "Lots of Copies
   Keep Stuff Safe" ([43]LOCKSS), but one would do best to keep scoffing
   at a minimum until reading this article. LOCKSS is a project
   spearheaded by Stanford to provide a method for libraries to preserve
   an electronic journal by capturing and storing the bits in a redundant
   and automatically reparable network cache. The system is currently in
   a beta test with servers around the globe. But do not assume that by
   storing the bits LOCKSS solves the digital preservation issue. LOCKSS
   solves only the most tractable part of the digital preservation
   problem -- keeping the bits around. Left for others to solve is the
   much more difficult problem of what to do when the format the
   information is in goes kaput (can anyone still open a WordStar file?).

   Schaffner, Bradley L. "Electronic Resources: A Wolf in Sheep's
   Clothing?" [45]College & Research Libraries 62 (3) (May 2001):
   239-249. - Schaffner's thesis statement on e-resources in libraries:
   electronic resources should complement rather than replace other
   formats. While he acknowledges the many advantages of electronic
   resources (full-text searchability, remote accessibility, etc.), he
   cautions that there are also many misconceptions about e-resources
   (that everything is available online, that they are cheaper and that
   they are can be more efficiently administered). These misconceptions
   mean that politicians and administrators (the ones who ultimately
   control libraries' purse strings) are eager to prioritize funding for
   virtual libraries over the budgetary needs of traditional library
   collections and staffing. The article also discusses the impact of
   electronic resources on research and includes the obligatory
   librarian's lament about the inability of many researches to
   effectively evaluate the resources they find on the Web. - [46]MP
   
   Specter, Michael. "The Doomsday Click" [47]The New Yorker (May 28,
   2001):101-107 - It's true what they say about The New Yorker: it's not
   as serious as it used to be, Condé Nast is refashioning it (emphasis
   on fashion) into a "lifestyle" publication, and in the national market
   for mass media it's the publicist's friend. But interesting info tech
   articles will show up in the darndest places. The title of this one
   and the accompanying illustration are certainly alarmist enough to
   cause some doubts, but the author has some good stories to tell about
   his experience as a 'bug collector' with most of the major worms and
   viruses archived on his hard drives. He relates his encounters with
   people such as Peter G. Neumann who are certain that a catastrophic
   net attack could happen any time, and describes his hands-on sessions
   with hackers in Amsterdam. In that last tale, the eye-opener for the
   general reader and maybe for some systems veterans, too, is the ease
   with which malicious code can be launched. "Skriptkiddies" or anyone
   else for that matter can send a virus down the pipes by simply
   following a recipe or filling out an online form. If you have the
   computer skills to order a t-shirt from J.Crew, then you also have the
   skills to cause some serious trouble. The article is part of the
   "Digital Age" issue. Please, I beg of you, take a look at the piece
   about the ubiquity of PowerPoint, in which some of the repercussions
   of overuse are revealed. For example, one mom's decision to include a
   PowerPoint presentation in a family meeting about household chores
   didn't go over too well with the kids. - JR
   
   Tognazzini, Bruce. [48]"How to Deliver a Report Without Getting
   Lynched" [49]AskTog (May 2001)
   (http://www.asktog.com/columns/047HowToWriteAReport.html). - Not
   getting lynched is probably high on most people's agenda. It's
   particularly high for those of us active in technical areas where
   reputations for articulate self-expression and sensitivity are not
   always the best. Here then in this short piece, interface veteran
   Bruce Tognazzini -- Tog -- reminds us that we'll sooner win people
   over with a spoonful of sugar than with a jigger of vinegar. The
   interchange between readers and Tognazzini following the piece is also
   worth looking at -- particularly where Tognazzini is reminded that he
   isn't always so diplomatic himself. - [50]LRK
