   Austen, Ian. "Study Reveals Web As Loosely Woven" New York Times (May
   18, 2000) Section G, p.8. - In a review of a new study of the web, a
   picture emerges -- one which has been clear to librarians for a while
   -- of a phenomenon "less like an elaborately interwoven community and
   more like the vast bureaucracy in Kafka's Castle: a mountain of
   disconnected information, lost files and frustrating dead ends." The
   study was presented at recent conferences in Amsterdam and Dallas and
   focused on web links. The study concluded that when trying to reach a
   specific destination if one only uses links this fails about 75% of
   the time; only 28% of web sites are strongly connected to the web, i.e
   have a substantial number of links to and from other sites. Another
   interesting consequence of the "weakly linked sites" is that many web
   crawlers determine the value of a site based on the number of links on
   it. By graphing their results the researchers drew a map of the web
   that looks less like a spiders web and more like a bow tie with pages
   in the center knot linking to pages on the right side. More recent
   sites (on the left side of the bow) link into the center but the
   center does not generally link back out to them. In an interesting
   comment, the author of the study under review, Raymie Stata, suggests
   that the average user wouldn't find the web compelling if it didn't
   have links because it would resemble a database such as Lexis-Nexis.
   What is forgotten in this comment is that Lexis-Nexis is a highly
   structured and well-organized collection of databases making it
   actually much easier to find relevant information. - ML

   uses the example of PubMed Central to discuss the issue of
   electronic scholarly publishing. PubMed Central was supposed to be an
   electronic archive administered by the NIH to give free access to
   biomedical research in the form of full text articles and research
   reports even before they appeared in a final printed form. The project
   came under fire from the New England Journal of Medicine as
   threatening "the evaluation and orderly dissemination of new clinical
   studies." In other words the dissemination of unreviewed research and
   the ability of traditional publishing outlets to adapt to new
   technological possibilities. Comparing this type of scholarly
   electronic publishing with the open source movement, ie. Linux, Blume
   suggests digital projects such as Pub Med Central will still allow
   traditional journals to frame and interpret data, and that this
   expertise will be the equivalent of an open source business making
   profits from documentation and customer support as opposed to the sale
   of sofware. - ML
   
   Carvajal, Doreen. "Four Giants Set to Embrace Electronic
   Publishing" The New York Times (online edition)
   (http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/05/biztech/articles/23books.ht
   ml) - With the digital publishing market predicted to reach critical
   mass in two to three years, three major publishing houses and
   Microsoft have decided to catch the wave that has already launched
   hundreds of smaller dot.com ventures. Carvajal outlines the details of
   an e-publishing partnership between Microsoft, Simon and Schuster, and
   Random House that hopes to propel itself to the wave's crest with the
   giveaway of an e-version of Crichton's popular time-traveling thriller
   Timeline, followed by the publication of a series of Star Trek titles.
   On a less than "tubular" note, these texts will be accessible only
   through Microsoft's proprietary reader software. Meanwhile, with an
   eye to tailoring its product to the quirks of modern-day reading and
   readers, Time Warner's iPublish site is poised to capture the Palm-
   and Rocket-book-wielding commuter-train market by proposing a series
   of shorter works of fiction and non-fiction, condensed works, and
   serialized pieces by known authors. Aiming primarily at an under-40
   readership, iPublish's sister site, iWrite, will tap the burgeoning
   "Who Wants to be a Writer?" crowd, accepting and vetting manuscripts
   without a fee from undiscovered hopefuls. - LM
   
   Coffman, Steve and Susan McGlamery. "The Librarian and Mr. Jeeves"
   American Libraries 31(5) (May 2000): 66-69. - Coffman is
   well-known for stirring the pot (see his previously cited
   articles,
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CurrentCites/bibondemand.cgi?query=coffman
   ), and this piece is no exception. Coffman is ably joined by Susan
   McGlamery, another forward-thinking librarian who shares Coffman's
   (and others) vision of 24x7 reference service. In this piece they look
   at existing commercial web reference services like Ask Jeeves and
   Webhelp, and wonder why we should abandon the unsuspecting public
   to companies with a commercial interest which have access to only
   web-based information and that possess only the most superficial
   understanding of how to go about helping people find what they need.
   They assert, "if we hope to continue to serve as honest brokers and
   offer a viable alternative to the Ask Jeeveses and Webhelps of the
   world, then we must adopt the tools and strategies of our competitors
   and join our patrons on the web." Coffman and McGlamery go on to
   describe an innovative project they are managing in Southern
   California, funded in part by grants, to do just that. The project is
   using Webline (recently bought out by Cisco Systems) software, which
   provides sophisticated tools well beyond "chat" to enable librarians
   to interact with patrons. If you work in a library, this project is
   clearly one to watch. - RT
   
   Desmarais, Norman. The ABCs of XML: The Librarian's Guide to the
   eXtensible Markup Language. New Technology Press, Houston: 2000. - -
   Desmarais has written a clear, concise guide to XML that should be of
   great use to not just librarians, but anyone interested in this
   important standard. In fact, the only chapter focusing on potential
   uses for XML is inexplicably given over to e-commerce -- a rather
   strange choice for a book aimed at librarians. I would much rather
   have seen "XML and its Potential for Libraries." But that is a minor
   quibble, and even completely skipping the chapter does little to
   diminish its substantial worth. What makes this book so good is not
   how big it is, but how little. At around 150 pages of text (and less
   than 130 if you don't count that useless chapter), Desmarais has done
   you a serious favor. He has boiled down a complicated topic to its
   essentials, and doesn't waste your time with the stuff and bother that
   plague many XML books. This will not be your last book on XML, but it
   would be hard to do better than this for your first. - RT
   
   Goldman, Roy, Jason McHugh, and Jennifer Widom. "Lore: A Database
   Management System for XML" Dr. Dobb's Journal (April 2000)
   (http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0004/0004i/0004i.htm). - XML is
   clearly taking the world of business by storm, if not the rest of us.
   Microsoft is into it bigtime, and in Silicon Valley you couldn't chuck
   a stone without hitting some dotcom that is betting the farm on it. So
   given this stampede, wouldn't you think we would be awash in database
   products optimized for structured text? Well, mostly what is available
   tends to be legacy database systems such as Oracle and Sybase that are
   being re-engineered in some way to accommodate XML. Lore, a research
   project at Stanford, is unique (as far as I'm aware) in that it is
   engineered from the ground up for XML. For example, you don't create a
   structure into which to load the XML data -- a typical SQL thing to do
   -- you don't create a structure at all. Lore does not assume any
   particular structure -- the data defines the structure for you. Lore,
   in other words, was constructed with XML in mind, not tweaked to
   accommodate it. If you're working with XML, or hope to, you should
   check this out. - RT
   
   Hitch, Leslie P. "Aren't We Judging Virtual Universities by Outdated
   Standards?" Journal of Academic Librarianship 26(1) (January 2000):
   21. - An interesting look at the role of distance learning in the
   context of traditional university values. What it means to be learner
   centered and how we define the role of faculty in "teaching" or merely
   "training" students in the online environment, the outmoded concept of
   the credit hour as a means for defining and translating completed
   student work among and between institutions, as well as a good chunk
   of library issues - where the most significant appear to be not how
   and when to provide distance learners with information, but how to
   provide them with the necessary information literacy skills to help
   them plow through the ever growing quantities of information available
   to them online. Intriguing for the implications of library technology
   in contributing to the developing definitions of library user services
   in the increasingly online context of higher education. - LR
   
   King, David, "Specialized Search Engines: Alternatives to the Big
   Guys" Online 24 (3) (May 2000)
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2000/king5.html) - The May
   edition of Online Magazine, which regularly features Greg R. Notess'
   excellent monthly column(s) on what's happening under the hood of
   various search engines, offers a slew of articles on different aspects
   of web searching. As a group they are sure to make riveting reading
   for the wireless palm-wielding, train-commuting information
   technologist, along with the rest of us. As a representative sampling,
   I will single out David King's article on specialized search engines
   which focus on a particular subject, file format, region, and so on.
   Despite the touted filtering success of killer sorting algorithms on
   the millions of pages being indexed by the Big Guys' robots and
   crawlers, some searchers are increasingly availing themselves of
   engines that are more tailored to their own needs, and that appear to
   some extent at least to have benefited from human vetting and
   annotation. As King puts it, why founder in the vast reaches of Super
   Wal-Mart searching for that special item, when you can find it quickly
   and painlessly in the specialty shop on the corner, and perhaps even
   get some trusted product information from a knowledgeable clerk in the
   bargain? King next outlines some of the features of nearly a score of
   specialized engines in the fields of Health Care, Law, Science, and
   Multimedia. In the library of Babel that the web is fast becoming, if
   you wish to find a specialized search engine to suit your needs you
   will have to leap into the mis-en-abyme, so to speak, of proliferating
   search engines to locate search engines ... ad infinitum. A few are
   listed in the article, e.g. Search Engine Guide at
   http://searchengineguide.com; Search Engine Watch:
   http://www.searchenginewatch.com/links/; and Invisible Web:

   Lynch, Clifford. "From Automation to Transformation" EDUCAUSE
   Review (January/February 2000): 60-68
   (http://www.educause.edu/pub/er/erm00/pp060068.pdf). - This piece
   summarizes the recent transformation of academic libraries from
   bastions of print to highly computerized bastions of print, with a
   layer of digital on top. Anyone who has lived through these
   interesting times will likely both recognize his descriptions and be
   amazed at what we have accomplished. Those who haven't been a part of
   it may be surprised to realize just how long and how thoroughly
   libraries have been involved with computerization -- first to automate
   existing procedures, then to create or use new ways of providing
   collections and services. For example -- slowly, quietly, and
   thoroughly, librarians around the world have created a monolithic
   union catalog of library holdings using a computer standard created by
   the library community in the 1960s -- long before most people had ever
   come in contact with a computer. But far from resting on these
   laurels, Lynch suggests that "[academic] libraries must now turn their
   attention to defining their missions and activities in relationship to
   their transforming context -- the information technology revolution in
   teaching, learning, and research." - RT
   
   Moen, William E. and John Carlo Bertot. "Interoperability for
   Information Access: Technical Standards and Policy Considerations"
   Journal of Academic Librarianship 26:2 (March 2000): 129. - Moen
   provides a brief look at the role of standards in libraries, from MARC
   to TCP/IP. Bemoaning the somewhat limited activity of the library
   community on national and international standards making groups such
   as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web
   Consortium, Moen asks whether standards development (such as with XML)
   is moving on a course which is compatible with future library
   directions. A brief discussion of the common role of Z39.50 in system
   interoperability is provided. However, larger and more interesting
   questions of the role of system interoperability in the face of
   unified user gateway interfaces such as those variously termed "My
   Library" or "My Gateway," in addition to the policy and technical
   questions surrounding interoperability in a environement of continued
   proliferation of databases and other online tools, are not addressed.

   Sherman, Chris. "The Future Revisited: What's New with Web Search"
   Online 24 (3) (May 2000)
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2000/sherman5.html) - As the
   author himself is well-aware, to prognosticate about web futures is a
   risky business. However, Sherman dares to look at the daily onslaught
   of web developments and pick out some important signs of what's to
   come: convergence (access with content, with that mix popping up in
   new devices), massive search engines which can take bigger bites from
   the smorgasbord of web pages, more sophisticated
   human/machine-compiled directories, systems adaptable to personal
   needs, browser-free searching, search input capability increasing from
   phrases to large chunks of text, and a few AI gee-whizzes. Each idea
   is clearly explained and related to real-world examples. Includes a
   complete list of relevant URLs. - JR
   
   Shneiderman, Ben. "Universal Usability" Communications of the ACM
   (http://www.acm.org/cacm/) 43(5) (May 2000):84-91. - There's been a
   lot written about achieving universal access, so computer technology
   becomes as ubiquitous as TV, but "there it is, use it" doesn't work as
   the final step in the process when a significant percentage of the
   public can't take advantage of it. Shneiderman advocates a research
   agenda for making universal usability the goal, and focuses on three
   challenges for attaining it: adapting to technology variety, accepting
   the fact of user diversity, and bridging gaps in user knowledge. With
   a realistic attitude about the technology enthusiast's fear that
   accomodating low-skilled users will result in a lowest common
   denominator system, he cites cases which demonstrate success in
   multi-level implementations, and the unexpected universal benefits of
   innovations which originally targeted only those who needed a little
   extra help. Though the primary audience for this article is software
   designers, those of us who are information providers for a broad
   spectrum of people will find this article thought-provoking and
   encouraging. - JR
