   Austen, Ian. [7]"Rebooted Any Good Books Lately?" [8]The New York
   Times (January 4, 2001): Section G; Page 1; Column 2
   (http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/04/technology/04BOOK.html). - This
   overview of e-books takes a look at dedicated book readers such as the
   Franklin eBookman and the REB 1100 from RCA as well as software such
   as Microsoft Reader that allows palm style devices to act as reading
   devices. The issues to keep in mind when selecting an ebook include
   battery life, ease of use and navigation, readability, size and,
   something that is sometimes overlooked, the availability of books to
   download. While each of the readers and software options have their
   own strengths and weaknesses it is the difficulty of locating and
   downloading titles that appears to be a major obstacle in the adoption
   of this technology. For example, various titles available online may
   only be read using Microsoft Reader and only on a desktop or laptop
   computer, the process of downloading can be onerous and the cost of
   e-books is barely less than their print counterparts. It seems that
   this interesting area of new reading technology has a ways to go
   before competing with the erstwhile paperback. - [9]ML
   
   Calhoun, Karen, and John J. Reimer, guest eds. "CORC: New Tools and
   Possibilities for Coopertaive Electronic Resource Description" [10]The
   Journal of Internet Cataloging 4(1/2) (2001). - The entire issue is
   devoted to discussing the [11]Cooperative Online Resource Cataloging
   (CORC) project, an effort led by [12]OCLC to catalog Internet
   resources. If this is all new to you, begin with the first article
   "Collaboration in CORC" by Thomas B. Hickey of OCLC (p.5-16). Other
   contributions cover specific areas of the CORC effort, or particular
   experiences with using it. [By the way, is it just me, or shouldn't
   the Journal of Internet Cataloging at least have Dublin Core metadata
   in META tags on the journal home page?] - [13]RT
   
   Cohen, Laura B. "Yahoo! and the Abdication of Judgment" [14]American
   Libraries 32(1) (January 2001): 60-62. - In this piece Cohen rightly
   criticizes the library profession for overlooking the many faults of
   the Internet subject directory [15]Yahoo!. She cites several reasons
   for this: a) a fear that users will see our opposition to typical user
   behavior as irrelevant, b) our desire to give our customers what they
   want (even if it isn't particularly good for them), c) abandonment our
   mission to improve user searching behavior, and d) negligence of our
   professional responsibilities. "In a world where the proliferation of
   information is accelerating," Cohen asserts, "and paradigmatic changes
   are sweeping our profession, we cannot toy with our standards or the
   trust of our users." Her solution? "We should explain to our users the
   deficiencies of Yahoo!, establish a repertoire of recommended
   alternatives, and teach those alternatives with confidence." Cohen
   reminds me that the reaction of the library profession (not everyone,
   but in general) to the Internet passed through several stages:
   indifferent ignorance, denial, opposition, tentative acceptance, and
   slavish acceptance. It appears that Cohen is hopeful that we can move
   out of the slavish acceptance stage by remembering and reapplying our
   professional principles to the Internet age. - [16]RT
   
   Cox, Richard J. [17]"The Great Newspaper Caper: Backlash in the
   Digital Age" [18]First Monday 5(12) (December 4, 2000)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_12/cox/). - Anyone who ever
   felt peeved reading noted author Nicholson Baker's send-up of the San
   Francisco Public Library's new building, and, more recently, his
   article on the crisis in newspaper preservation, should read this
   article. Cox presents a well-organized deconstruction of Baker's
   central premises, and manages to be polite in doing so. He makes the
   case that a "big lie" is being foisted on the American public, namely,
   that research libraries are being irresponsible. This and other points
   are made throughout the article, making this it a useful companion
   piece to Baker's ruminations. - [19]TH
   
   Gregory, Vicki L. [20]"UCITA: What Does it Mean for Libraries?"
   [21]Online (25)1 (Jan/Feb 2001) p. 30-34
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL2001/gregory1_01.html). - UCITA,
   the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, is really a
   proposal which attempts to standardize contract law for digital
   resource licenses on a state-by-state basis. It must be adopted by
   each state legislature -- contract law generally being a state matter
   -- but its power to change how your library handles such resources is
   just as potent as federal law. Opponents believe that UCITA can
   severely restrict the fair use exemptions in copyright law which
   librarians and others rely upon; adherents believe that copyright law
   will take precedence. This clash and other areas of contention are
   admirably explained in layman's terms by the author, as are the
   diffences between general regulation (copyright) and arrangement
   between private parties (contract). This article will be of particular
   interest to collection development librarians and administrators
   responsible for analyzing the terms of agreement for CDs, DVDs and
   online access. - JR
   
   Hafner, Katie. [22]"Web Sites Begin to Self Organize" [23]The New York
   Times (January 18, 2001): Section G; Page 1; Column 1
   (http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/18/technology/18SELF.html). -
   Librarians are constantly stressing the importance of critically
   evaluating the quality of websites before trusting the information
   provided. In a spinoff from the user ratings seen at sites such as
   Amazon or CNET, there is an emerging class of sites, [24]thevines.com,
   [25]themestream.com, and [26]plastic.com being examples, whereby users
   grade content. For example, a writer can contribute material to one of
   these sites on ancient Rome. Users then rate the work according to a
   grading system. When someone else is looking for work on ancient Rome
   those writings which have received higher grades from users will
   automatically come to the top of the search list. The websites thus
   become self-organizing or self-adapting. Each of the sites have
   developed ways to prevent what they call "click circles" whereby
   groups of friends bombard the site with glowing reviews of a
   particular item. Some sites such as [27]Slashdot do have a modicum of
   editorial oversight but for the most part a user is relying on unknown
   reviewers to filter and rate content. Eventually, one may trust the
   opinions of particular reviewers but for the most part this still
   leaves us with the problem of evaluating the evaluators. - [28]ML
   
   Lagoze, Carl. [29]"Keeping Dublin Core Simple: Cross-Domain Discover
   or Resource Description?" [30]D-Lib Magazine 7(1) (January 2001)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january01/lagoze/01lagoze.html). - Readers
   of Current Cites are [31]familiar with the [32]Dublin Core (DC) -- a
   draft standard for recording basic information about "document-like
   objects". Designed as a common meeting ground between more robust
   descriptive systems such as MARC, there has been pressure from some
   participants in the process to complicate the DC to allow more complex
   and full-featured DC systems. In this readable and well-argued
   article, Lagoze explains the rationale behind keeping DC simple. By
   using simple but efffective examples, Lagoze makes a compelling
   argument for his contention, and one that those actively using the DC
   would do well to heed. Even users of DC do not always realize that it
   is only meant to be a medium of exchange of metadata between more
   complex metadata schemes, and not a complex metadata scheme itself. It
   is, in the end, too simple to be of much use for anything except
   simple resource discovery. Which, if you remember your history (back
   lo, those many years ago in 1995), is all it set out to be in the
   first place. - [33]RT
   
   Morgan, Eric Lease, ed. [34]"Special Issue: User-Customizable Library
   Portals" [35]Information Technology and Libraries 19(4) (December
   2000) (http://www.lita.org/ital/ital1904.html) - We've had excellent
   articles introducing the concept and others profiling individual
   sites, but for those who want to delve deeper into the My Library
   thing and see how it's playing out in several locations, this is for
   you. Implementation is still new enough that nobody has really
   conclusive usage stats, but patterns are emerging which show that,
   while they can't replace a well-planned library Web presence and an
   efficient search system, customizable features are catching on and are
   highly valued by early adopters (including librarians who are using
   them to create quick course-oriented library pages). Articles on the
   experience at North Carolina State, University of Washington and
   Virginia Commonwealth University focus on the technical details of
   creation and assessment of usage, while others address change in
   organizational culture and impact on the nature of librarianship. Some
   libraries which already have prototypes in the works may be beyond
   most of this, but I believe that group is still pretty small. The
   library administrators who haven't considered this option because
   they're short on computing staff may want to rethink after reading
   this issue. The paths have been cleared by the pioneers using open
   source software, so putting it in place doesn't require a large
   investment in systems staff time. - JR
   
   Raveendra, V.V.S. [36]"E-Business Application Development: The
   Paradigm Shift from In-House Application Development" [37]First Monday
   6(1) (January 8, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_1/raveendra/). - This
   article analyzes e-business applications in plain English but with
   considerable depth. Systems librarians and others who need to be
   thinking about e-business applications of their own, like digital
   reference on a "24/7" basis, will appreciate the author's
   straightforward remarks. For example, he says that Web pages "'need
   not be beautiful' but they do need to keep customers happy." He also
   displays good awareness of what different settings require. - [38]TH
   
   [39]"Top Technology Trends" Top Technology Trends Committee, Library
   and Information Technology Association
   (http://www.lita.org/committe/toptech/mainpage.htm). - This is not
   technically a cite, but rather a heads-up notice about the Web
   publication which will summarize this discussion which occurred at the
   ALA Midwinter 2001 meeting in January. Topics included e-books, user
   customization and censorship of online resources crossing national
   boundaries. The site is worth visiting now to see the records of
   discussions at previous meetings, and to become familiar with the
   group. Of course, by the time you read this, the Midwinter 2001
   summary may be already there, but isn't that the net way ... - JR
