   Borden, Mark [8]"Rip-Resistant CDs Do Not Compute" [9]Business 2.0
   (January 2002)
   (http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,36644,FF.html) - They've
   succeeded in strangling Napster, and they've sued MusicCity and KaZaA.
   They're in the process of launching subscription music services that
   severely limit what a customer may do with the music he or she has
   paid to download. Well, now the recording industry "is testing what
   could be the least popular copyright protection plan yet" -- digital
   rights management schemes that keep an audio CD from being played in
   the CD drive on a personal computer. Obviously, this is an attempt to
   keep consumers from "ripping and burning." Universal Music, the
   largest of the record labels, says it plans to put copy protection on
   all its CDs within six months. Meanwhile, the other labels are quietly
   testing copy-protected CDs in certain markets. Unfortunately, the copy
   protection technology keeps some of these disks from playing in car CD
   players, DVD players or videogame consoles. Complaints from users are
   on the increase; people are returning what they perceive to be
   defective disks, creating logistical headaches and bad publicity. (If
   you're worried about ending up with one of these things, check out Fat
   Chuck's Corrupt CDs -- [10]http://fatchucks.com/corruptcds/ -- before
   you lay your money down.) Hackers, meanwhile, are ramping up to take
   on this latest challenge to their technological prowess. - [11]SK

   While we often say that we want to build library collections and
   services that our clientele will find effective and easy to use, we
   don't always know exactly what that may mean for particular segments
   of our users. This document begins to answer some of those questions
   for humanities scholars by looking at they approach their work and how
   new technologies are changing it. This isn't always easy, as they
   point out. "A blithe comment from one of our respondents is worth
   reflection: "I want everything at my fingertips." This may seem like
   an unattainable goal; nonetheless, it is the job of researchers and
   information professionals to figure out the best ways to make progress
   toward this end. "Everything," in this scholar's words, does not
   really mean everything; it means those things that make a difference
   in the scholar's ability to do work well. What it means to do work
   well can be studied, understood, and responded to in the information
   systems we develop." Their research, and this report on it, is good
   beginning to this process. - [13]RT
   [14]Budapest Open Access Initiative
   (http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml). - The [15]Open Society
   Institute (OSI) held a meeting on December first and second of last
   year that resulted in the creation of the Budapest Open Access
   Initiative (BOAI). The BOAI manifesto, which was written by Stevan
   Harnad, Michael Eisen, Peter Suber, and other meeting participants,
   vigorously advocates "open access" to peer-reviewed articles, which is
   defined as follows: "By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its
   free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to
   read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full
   texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to
   software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial,
   legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining
   access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and
   distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should
   be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the
   right to be properly acknowledged and cited." You'll note that it's
   not just free access to scholarly articles that's proposed, but also
   free reuse of these articles by any party for any purpose as long as
   the integrity of the articles is preserved and they are properly
   attributed and cited. The two main strategies recommended by the BOAI
   are self-archiving and alternative journals. The [16]BOAI FAQ is
   essential reading for fully understanding the BOAI. As of 2/14/02,
   over 350 individuals and 30 organizations had [17]signed the BOAI, and
   others are encouraged to [18]do so. The Open Society Institute
   [19]will support open access projects with one million dollars per
   year for a three-year period. Check out the BOAI [20]home page for
   more information on this important initiative. - [21]CB
   
   Charles, Susan K. "Knowledge Management Lessons from the Document
   Trenches" [22]Online 26 (1) (January/February 2002). - A preliminary
   version of the document is available at
   [23]http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-230.pdf; The
   author, an Information/Research Analyst with Hewlett Packard, presents
   a case study based on her own experience at HP. She describes the
   trials, the pitfalls, the caveats, and the disappointment encountered
   during an attempt to implement a comprehensive knowledge management
   (KM) system within her organization. Covered are the typical steps
   that need to be taken in order to launch such a program. Needs must be
   evaluated and enunciated. Existing data and databases must be located
   and integrated. The developers of a KM initiative should get to know
   the perspective endusers, should elicit their recommendations, and
   should familiarize them with the benefits of the planned system.
   Despite best intentions, and best laid plans this KM project has
   languished. Thus, to complete the article, the author presents an
   overview of lessons learned. The tenets are based on the Oz and Sosik
   article (Oz, Effy &; John J. Sosik, "Why Information Systems Projects
   are Abandoned; A Leadership and Communication Theory and Exploratory
   Study"; [24]Journal of Computer Information Systems, 41 (1), Fall

   with IFRAME" [27]O'Reilly Network (February 8, 2002)
   (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/02/08/iframe.html). -
   Script kiddies are going to love this discussion by Eric Costello of
   remote scripting through an IFRAME. Basically the idea is to
   dynamically generate information coming quite possibly from a database
   through a tiny window called an IFRAME. This obviates the need to keep
   constantly going from one window to another just because a piece of
   information changes. The web, and in this case, the web page, is
   becoming a far more dynamic place with much of the action taking place
   'under the hood' so to speak. This is just one in a number of articles
   showing great creativity on the part of web developers in applying
   standard's based approaches to mark-up and page layout. See
   [28]alistapart.com and Costello's own [29]glish.com (just to name two)
   for more examples. - [30]LRK
   
   Debowski, Shelda "Wrong way: Go Back! An Exploration of Novice Search
   Behaviours While Conducting an Information Search." [31]Electronic
   Library 19(6) (2001): 371-382. - Detailed look at how 48
   undergraduates from Western Australia navigated the SilverPlatter
   version of ERIC on CD-ROM. This included what the students were typing
   in the search boxes. Not surprisingly, results bordered on the
   calamitous. Students were unable to pick up on promising avenues of
   exploration at the same time as they repeated, perhaps as a sign of
   exhaustion, previous failed strategies. The author is right to point
   out that "good searching is not something that comes naturally to us
   all", particularly where structured language is concerned. The need
   for a "strong supportive structure" is clearly illustrated. - [32]LRK

   Long-time readers of Current Cites are probably getting tired of us
   citing articles on the [35]Dublin Core. A search of our database
   brings up [36]21 citations since 1996. But there is a good reason for
   this. The Dublin Core is probably our best hope for a common meeting
   ground between a collection of metadata standards that is evocative of
   the Tower of Babel. Although the DC is not large enough (it is a core,
   after all), nor granular enough, or adequately qualified (yet) for
   many metadata uses, we can all "dumb down" our metadata enough to
   contribute records into a common pot. And sometimes that makes all the
   difference in the world. So with this progress report we finally see
   DC coming into its own. NISO passed it as ANSI Standard Z39.85 (albeit
   by the skin of its teeth). But more importantly, the [37]Open Archives
   initiative adopted it as the only required metadata element set
   OAI-compliant archives must support. This development alone may be
   enough to solidify the position of the DC at the center of disparate
   communities with metadata to share. - [38]RT

   It wasn't all that long ago that any library wanting to embark on a
   project to digitize a collection and put it online for all to see
   would be making up a lot of the process from scratch. Thankfully,
   those days are now over. No more evidence of this is required than
   this online document, which not only makes good, clear statements
   regarding best practices for doing this type of activity, but also
   points to the growing literature on the topic. Principles are laid
   down in the areas of collections, objects (creating and preserving
   digital versions), metadata, and projects. The principles are good
   ones and the pointers are invaluable. Although this document itself is
   a quick read, the items it points you to can keep you busy for weeks.
   Compared to the state of affairs not long ago, it is an embarrassment
   of riches. If you find something you don't like, or are missing

   (http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/07/technology/circuits/07HERE.html?pag
   ewanted=all). - "Presence awareness" is an intriguing but somewhat
   scary technology that could well put an end to phone tag -- at a cost
   of upping the general paranoia level. This is something that can be
   programmed into cell phones and other wireless devices so that users
   will be able to tell, instantly, whether another person's gizmo is
   turned on and in use. Some systems may incorporate a GPS element,
   making it possible to track another user geographically. While this
   may give some of us the willies, one assistant professor at NYU who
   studies Internet relationships feels that presence technology can
   provide reassurance to those who "are comforted when they can see the
   distant movements of people from their inner circles, like family and
   friends." Instant messaging applications are already giving us a taste
   of this, as our "buddy lists" allow us to see who is online and how
   long someone has been logged in. Some of the obvious privacy issues
   can be addressed by building in "permission features or other blocking
   tools." Then, of course, users would be faced with "the social dilemma
   of managing privacy without appearing rude." - [43]SK

   the face of rising unemployment among dot-com and technology workers,
   unsolicited resumes "are beginning to clutter electronic inboxes
   across the nation." Since it costs nothing to append additional e-mail
   addresses to a message, many job-seekers are taking the chance.
   "There's no penalty for trying," says a San Francisco State University
   professor. "Ants will find a hole in the wall to get the bread." Alas,
   employers tend not to look favorably on "job-related spam," and there
   have already been instances of severe backlash against candidates
   trying this scattershot approach. Those who send their resumes as
   attachments to messages are even less likely to get noticed, as
   corporate e-mail users commonly shun attachments due to fear of
   viruses. - [46]SK

   Newman, David V. "Impersonal interactions and ethics on the

   239-246 - Since anyone who has browsed the Web has been confronted
   with unwanted Web content, readers may glance at this article and
   wonder why a guy would publish what appear to be his first baby steps
   toward understanding a common experience. However, like any good
   philosopher, the author is getting down to the fundamental elements of
   what is occurring: in this case, the interaction between the Web user
   and the Web authors who are imposing popup windows and attack pages on
   his browser. His thesis is that "any situation involving personal
   interaction that takes control of a person's computer without informed
   consent brings about a species of moral problem that is only possible
   with computers." Newman analyzes what separates this from other
   conduits for unsolicited advertising, and defines the basic conflict
   as being between free speech rights (the Web authors) and property
   rights (the computer user). His rather naive proposal for the
   development of an advance-warning system to help users fend off
   browser-ambush sounds like a type of metadata which the unscrupulous
   could easily work around. Still, this short piece is a useful poke in
   the ribs to stop monkeying with details for awhile and step back to
   ponder basic principles. - JR

   which Library Trend thoughtfully reprints as part of its special issue
   devoted to computer-assisted instruction. The message here is not to
   get carried away with the technology. Indeed, the author admits from
   the outset that he is concerned with the "more fundamental problem of
   teaching and learning". He then goes on to examine where online
   instruction can do the most good and at what level in the intellectual
   development of the student. He concludes, "if we think of the World
   Wide Web as a medium for teaching, we necessarily move to questions of
   the nature of this medium, what it can do, what it can do well, how we
   develop teaching styles consonant with the Web and with our personal
   styles and pedagogies and how we integrate it, or not, with existent
   educational institutions. And all these questions must somehow fit the
   learning strategies of our students." - [53]LRK

   an increasingly scarce commodity on the Internet, and Web-based e-mail
   accounts are being squeezed. Two of the largest providers -- Yahoo!
   and MSN's Hotmail -- have quietly added fee services, and are cutting
   back on perks to free users. While free e-mail is unlikely to
   disappear entirely, you can increasingly count on being hit up for
   popular features such as forwarding and extra storage above a minimal
   level. Providers are also merging or outright disappearing, so users
   are left with fewer choices. IDC researchers estimate that there are
   currently more than 150 million free Web-based e-mail accounts in
   existence. - [56]SK
