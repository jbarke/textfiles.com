ZINES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1 CENT--(#299, February 1994), 1357 Lansdowne Ave., Toronto 
Ontario, CANADA, M6H 3Z9.  2 pp.  Nice verbo-visually-augmented 
haiku-like winter scene by jw curry.--bg

1 CENT--(#300, March 1994), 1357 Lansdowne Ave., Toronto Ontario, 
CANADA, M6H 3Z9.  36 pp.  Special anniversary collection of 36 
"kernular poems."  Each page a different size and coming out of a 
different part of the binding.  Wide variety of poems like one by 
Brian David Johnston that's called just "A Poem": "Art is long./ 
Life is short./ Brian is heavily medicated."  There are other, 
seriouser, equally good ones in the batch.--bg

1 CENT--(#301, March 1994), 1357 Lansdowne Ave., Toronto Ontario, 
CANADA, M6H 3Z9.  1 pp.  A single visual poem called "New Age 
Blues" by Stephen Cain that makes a pinwheelish game of the word 
"naive."--bg

1 CENT--(#302, April 1994), 1357 Lansdowne Ave., Toronto Ontario, 
CANADA, M6H 3Z9.  2 pp.  A one-paged poem, or set of 3 poems, by 
bp Nichol that includes the lines, "'Your poetry is so tight/ it 
squeaks.'"  This issue was dispersed the afternoon of April 30th, 
1994, at Toronto's newly christened "bp Nichol Lane."--bg

1 CENT--(May 1994), 1357 Lansdowne Ave., Toronto Ontario, CANADA, 
M6H 3Z9.  8 pp.  Some excellent reviews of otherstream material 
by publisher jw curry, including a visual poetry anthology from 
Germany.  Great quote attributed to MB Duggan in one review that 
exactly, parodically states what makes so many published haiku 
very bad: "Nature is nice./ Civilization is evil. Suffering is to 
be pointed out and pitied."  Also scatter poems and graphics, 
including the anonymously-rendered "Connect the Dot" puzzle.  
Yes, it's just one dot.--bg

6IX--(Vol. 3 #2, 1994), 427 W. Carpenter Lane, Philadelphia PA, 
19119.  36 pp., $4.00.  (914 Leisz's Bridge Rd., Reading PA 
19605??)  Graced by Gil Ott's subtle cover collage of a Japanese-
calligraphied whale swimming in a steno-pad of fluid handwriting, 
this beautifully edited issue features a selection from Elena 
Rivera's "Wale: or, the Corse," inspired by Melville's Moby Dick 
and Charles Olson's "Call Me Ishmael",  as well as the way 
"whale" disintegrated in the echo to "wale," which are welts that 
rise up after a lash.  Jenny Gough's "two poems" resonates, with 
"what better way to underscore the/ flower than allow the blister 
to appear in the light of stamps."--ssn

ABACUS--(#85, October 1994), 181 Edgemont Ave., Elmwood CT, 
06110.  18 pp., $4.00.  A text by Carla Harryman to be used in a 
film by Abigail Child assembled from the work of three writers.  
The premise of the film, in Harryman's words, is "to challenge 
the concepts of private and public space by creating a melodrama 
in which domestic life is filmed outside, much of it in a house 
without walls."  Lots of politics, and the characters have names 
like "Technique," Fulcrum," and "Property," but the dialogue is 
jauntily natural-sounding and flows.  Makes me eager to see the 
Child film, which is called "Rubble".--bg

ABUSE--(Summer 1994), PO Box 1242, Allston MA, 02134.  104 pp., 
$4.00.  Every once in awhile I run across a project I have to 
part of because it's so damn good.  ABUSE is one of those.  It's 
theme this issue: DEATH AND DYING.  This reads like a strange 
cross-section of America, with students and academics, artists, 
writers, psychopaths, comic publishers and drawers, all smashing 
together in a jam-packed euphoric worship of the dying process.  
There is sadness, anger, and satire, as well as a strange 
acceptance of the inevitable, but what stands out is the way all 
these different perspectives seem to blend together and form a 
strange logical cohesion.--o

ALIEN RELAY--(August 1994), c/o Jake, PO Box 11407, Shorewood WI, 
53211.  24 pp., $1.00 (?).  This reminds me of the mid-'80s when 
zines were new and fresh, and there was a combination of anger 
and innocence in the small presses.  However, we're running into 
the mid-'90s with only an illusion of being in control, and the 
Slacker mentality has overgrown its DIY roots, and I don't know, 
maybe I've lost touch with the youth of today, or maybe I just 
wish that more zines today carried a little bit of fight instead 
of a passive acceptance.--o

ALTERNATIVE PRESS REVIEW--(#3, Spring/Summer 1994), PO Box 1446, 
Columbia MO, 65205.  82 pp., $4.00.  This issue includes a 
moderately interesting short history of fanzine publishing by 
Michelle Rau that seems a work of genius next to TIME's September 
5th discovery of the genre.  APR continues to slight the art wing 
of the "alternative press" (in my admittedly biased opinion), but 
this issue does have a number of articles worth reading, 
including Leora Tannenbaum's "Sex, Fear, and Feminism On Campus," 
which argues against the position that rape is whatever causes a 
woman to feel violated.--bg

ANT, ANT, ANT, ANT, ANT--(#1), PO Box 16177, Oakland CA, 94610.  
48 pp., $3.00.  "A journal of haiku, small poetry, and minute 
experimentalia" such as editor Chris Gordon's "the house darkens 
into the rain     i hold her approximation."  Three poems by 
Robert Creeley, and some fine unattributed graphics including a 
terrific misfocused photo of a cat turned Franz-Marc-sculptural 
as it boldly starts downward into some mysterious somewhere.--bg
     Mostly haiku, but also some non-haiku, a couple longer 
pieces (some of which are like haiku sequences), and some photos 
and drawings.  A lot for $3.  And a lot of it is very good.  I 
especially like editor Crhis gordon's one-liners (e.g. "desire 
blossoom sinside me the teeth of an atrocity"), but there's a lot 
of creative nuggets in here.  The best parts come from the 
authors i hadn't heard of before, such as this (by a. daigu): 

    approximate space
         of a haiku conceived and
              later forgotten 
--ar

ARTHUR'S COUSIN--(Vol. 2 #2, Summer 1994), c/o Joshua, 2501 
Wickersham Ln. #2132, Austin TX, 78741.  14 pp., $1 and one 29  
stamp.  I still love to drift through zines, because they often 
carry information and writing that takes chances, and isn't 
concerned so much with social acceptance as challenging society 
itself. In this issue Joshua takes on BARNEY, demanding his 
immediate destruction so children can be freed from television's 
corrupting effect.  He also takes on 90210, criticizing the 
unrealistic representation of heroin addiction, large breasted 
simple minded women, pregnant sluts, etc.  But then I looked on 
the next page, and there was an ad for The Rollins Band's Weight 
CD, and I got this ugly feeling that I was in one of the tv shows 
that were getting criticized. Overall I really like this zine 
because it asks a lot of questions, and brings up issues that 
most people would never think of because they are too busy 
following, not thinking, or questioning the world around them.--o

AVALON RISING--(#25, June 1994), PO Box 1983, Cincinnati OH, 
45201.  24 pp., $1.00.  Two or three texts from four different 
poets and a series of True-Romance-dictioned excerpts from 
Michael Estabrook's grandmother's diary (that seem authentic but 
I think are not), followed by a poem by Estabrook about her 
suicide after being caught by her husband with another man in 
1932.  Among other contributors, poets John M. Bennett and Lyn 
Lifshin celebrate language, while Robert Howington and Errol 
Miller story.  Good mix.--bg

AVEC--(#7, 1984), PO Box 1059, Penngrove CA, 94951.  150 pp., 
$7.50.  Strong, challenging work that requires active and erudite 
reading--at least a nodding acquaintance w/ Dante, f'rinstance, 
would be helpful, as well as more than a bit of PoMo literary 
theory.  Several pieces usefully cross genre boundaries: 
collaborative dance/spoken work from Ney Fonseca & Aaron Shurin; 
a graphic improvisational score written for the ROVA sax quartet 
by Bruce Ackely; and writing to & thru graphics (Susan Gevirtz 
responding to photos by Kristine Larwen; Micheal Palmer to 
drawings by Mica‘la Henich).  David Levi Strauss also combines 
word & image in "Odile and Odette", a series of letters from 
Berlin; there's also another section from Nathaniel Mackey's 
ongoing epistletory fiction "From A Broken Bottle Traces of 
Perfume Still Emanate."  Kevin Killian, Margy Sloan, and Dodie 
Bellamy are all given a chance to stretch out for more than a 
couple of pages, while Leslie Scalapino, Kevin Magee, Jean Day, 
Myung Mi Kim, Susan Clark, Ben Hollander and Laura Moriarty have 
longer works excerpted--leaving one to wish for more.--lbd  
     Editor Cydney Chadwick has done a consistentland a concluding 
tercet.  Amazing that in this age of free form or form 
manipulation creation, form being an extension of content, etc. 
form, that there would be 62 pages of sestinas out and about in 
poetry world.  But herein collected they are with their end words 
patterned: 123456, 615243, 364125 etc.  More amazing the list of 
those who are included herein: Ted Berrigan & Ron Padgett, Anne 
Waldman, Clayton Eshleman, Maxine Chernoff, Kevin Lillian, Susan 
Wheeler, Nina Zivancevic.  A unique, innovative editorial twist.  
This issue obviously has a program of writing.  Let's end with 
tercet pattern: 2,5; 4,3; 6,1.--mb opera" by Nathaniel Mackey--
not Mackey's best work, but still well done, with a salutary 
sense of humor.  Mei Mei Bersenbrugge--excellent, as usual.  
Edmond Jabes's "Dante's Hell"--one of the most engrossing, and 
unusual, of Jabes's meditations in the ongoing series of 
translations by Rosmarie Waldrop.--ky

B-CITY--(#8), 517 North Fourth St., DeKalb IL, 60115.  Special 
Sestina Issue.  The traditional sestina is a 39-line poem written 
in six sextets and a concluding tercet.  Amazing that in this age 
of free form or form manipulation creation, form being an 
extension of content, etc. form, that there would be 62 pages of 
sestinas out and about in poetry world.  But herein collected 
they are with their end words patterned: 123456, 615243, 364125 
etc.  More amazing the list of those who are included herein: Ted 
Berrigan & Ron Padgett, Anne Waldman, Clayton Eshleman, Maxine 
Chernoff, Kevin Lillian, Susan Wheeler, Nina Zivancevic.  A 
unique, innovative editorial twist.  This issue obviously has a 
program of writing.  Let's end with tercet pattern: 2,5; 4,3; 
6,1.--mb

BAD NEWS BINGO!--PO Box 33388, Austin TX, 78764.  34 pp., $3.00.  
I don't know very many people who had a decent childhood, so it's 
no surprise to see so much viciousness and psychological scarring 
in the latest issue of BAD NEWS BINGO!, who's theme is family.  
You get photos of Charlie Manson's bald headed family women, 
juvenile arrests, the death of one's mother to cancer, and so 
much confessional turf you read on out of curiosity, while 
feeling guilty, like you overheard somebody's words while they 
were talking to a priest.  There is truth here, and a lot of it 
is ugly.--o

BALLPEEN--(#4, 1994), PO Box 55892, Fondren, Jackson MS, 39296.  
55 pp., $4.00.  A stimulating art zine, engaging to the eye as 
well as to the intellect.  Genuinely learned essays.  Witty 
fiction, expert poems, graphics and eidetics.  A 
deconstructionist-cum-conceptualist point of view less the all-
to-common juvenile butt-head logic.  William Whallon's "Greek 
Cognates of the Vilest Words in English" is rewarding.  Michael 
Kirby's "Melodrama Manifesto of Structuralism" is useful for 
students of film theory and comp. lit.  Artfully produced by Mr. 
A. di Michele.--gvst

BANGTALE INTERNATIONAL--(1994), PO Box 83984, Phoenix AZ, 85078-
3984.  40 pp., $5.50.  Rod Farmer has poetry here, as does John 
M. Bennett, B.Z. Niditch, and Lyn Lifshin.  Pure emotionally 
direct poetry, sometimes experimental, other times tight and 
dynamic.  "I smoked the near finished Silk Cuts/ of another man's 
dream."  There is a world-weary feel here, as if it's all been 
done before and now all that's left is the echo of polytonality 
and taut white flesh.  "We've built fairy bridges/ of balsa wood 
and cellophane..."--rrle

BASEBALL AND THE 1,000 THINGS--(Vol. 1, #1-#3), 3016 French St., 
Erie PA, 16504.  4 pp.@, SASE.  Edited by Rick Lopez.  Lots of 
off-beat information and opinion, much of it about baseball, or 
about something else with baseball spliced in--for instance, a 
quotations about infinitesimal in math that Lopez uses to 
illustrate the diminishing powers of the baseball commissioner.  
Among the non-baseball material, this quotation from Pound's 
Cantos: "'You damn sadist.' said mr. cummings,/ 'you try to make 
people think.'"  These 3 issues contain just one poem and nothing 
I'd call otherstream (unless you count the plug for Harper's), 
but it's lots of (intelligent) fun.--bg

BASURA--(#1, October 1994), PO Box 3232, Aurora IL, 60504.  
20 pp., $1.00.  It's good when you see a debut issue that has 
some decent planning behind it, and with Cheryl Townsend, Paul 
Weinman, Todd Moore, Lyn Lifshin, John M. Bennett, Eric E. Scott, 
and others on board, you got a crew that is trained and ready for 
an all-out assault.  Lifshin's "The President's Forfinger" is 
"intent as a penis/it has a mind of its/ own..."; Moore's "Jerry" 
wasn't supposed "to have his old man's/sawed off..."; Townsend's 
"It Was Like" "butter he said..."; and an interview with Weinman 
are just a sampling of this fine first effort leaving scars.--o

BEET--(#9, Summer 1994), c/o Joe Maynard, 372 Fifth Ave., 
Brooklyn NY, 11215.  28 pp. (with a 28 pp. insert), $3.00.  
I wish I had hooked into more of the local action when I lived in 
Trenton NJ, especially after reading BEET.  You got kids having 
kids committing suicide (Allison Goodwin's "Photosynthesies"), 
coming of age realizations (Steven Sipes' "Our Hitlers, 
Ourselves"), and a great insert that documents a performance 
including Sparrow and Carl Watson, previous Chicago trickster.  
There are graphics that carry one liners that evolve into a 
lasting curiosity, and the realization you have been to new 
places you might want to visit again, only next time you'll be 
prepared and have the weapons to defend yourself.--o

BLACK BREAD--(#3, 1993), 100 Magazine St., Cambridge MA, 02139.  
78 pp., $5.00.  Edited by Jessica Lowenthal and Sianne Ngai.  The 
fourth moral of Lyn Hejinian's "A Fable," presented herein, 
reads: "Various women writer's will take up the philosophical 
quest for uncertainty."  It would be wildly speculative, and 
gender-biased, to suggest that women are more likely to quest for 
and embrace the real, uncertain, world--while men are apt to try 
to impose their own limiting, ossified vision of how things are & 
ever shall be.  I would never suggest that.  But the nine women 
contributors to this magazine do seem to gracefully evoke a 
vision of a world in flux, fragmented and flimsy and alive (and, 
therefore, dying).  I've read writers who seem dismayed by the 
imprecision of memory and language, or fight against their "lost" 
author-ity over text.  Compare them to Laynie Brown's fertilizing 
insect: "A bee gathers/ They absorb the world through their 
senses/ Everything is in a ferment."--lbd

BLADES--(#31, 1994), 182 Orchard Rd., Newark DE, 19711.  Edited 
by JoAnn Balangit and Francis Poole.  A small and quite personal 
publication, BLADES has been appearing for many years and always 
contains material of great interest, not to be found elsewhere.  
Each issue includes poems and drawings, interspersed with found 
texts, some quite strange and exotic.  This issue includes a poem 
or letter by Nistina, a 19th century Algonquin woman, and some 
translations of 12th century Andalusian poems.  One of the 
issues' high points is a long poem by JoAnn Balangit, "Dreams, 
Night of the Eclipse," of which part 3 follows:

     my sister's arm was straight
     as she handed me half a snake.
     She kept the half with the head.
     I pulled the body through my fist,
     squeezed tight, tail first,
     Wet slices of the snake
     slapped against the tile floor.

There is not a dull moment in these pages, which also include 
work by "Goya", D.P., Bukowski, P.J. Cooper, Francis Poole, as 
well as found and anonymous texts.--jmb

BLANK GUN SILENCER--(#9), BGS Press, 1240 William St., Racine WI, 
53402.  52 pp., $3.00.  Nielson is on of those editors I'd hate 
to get in a fight with--This fucker has some bad literary 
backing.  The issue leads off with a Bukowski poem that captures 
the cynical bitter outlook of a man who found little use for 
humanity, then leaps immediately into a Gerald Locklin poem about 
a homeless man catching on fire and starting a blaze that 
destroyed fifty luxury homes.  Mark Weber captures an Albuquerque 
morning in just the way I remember them back in 1974.  Cheryl 
Townsend drags us through an angry confused teenaged abortion; 
Jay Marvin has those she done left me blues; and Michael 
Estabrook captures that married man confusion when a young girl 
flirts with a condom.  Bite sized slabs of reality, not all of 
them pretty, but all of them so real you can't help but to nod 
your head in recognition.--o

CAFE REVIEW--(Vol. 5, #2), 20 Danforth St., Portland ME, 04101.  
$6.00.  Wonderful poetry of deep observation here by Helene 
Swarts, and an image rich piece by Tom Clark, but the heart of 
this issue is an interview and new poems by Michael McClure, and 
Jack Foley's "Exile".  These two act as a scatological quasi-
hallucinatory dose to the soul rendering almost anything else in 
the mag as adornment by comparison.  McClure's vitality and 
authentic voice combined with Foley's polyspirit manifestations 
shed stark light on even the darkest corners of the psyche and 
inspire us to do the same.  Great issue.--jb

CHAIN--(#1, Spring/Summer 1994), 107 14th Ave., Buffalo NY, 
14213.  282 pp., $7.95.  Central to the whole project that is 
Language Poetry is the refusal to take for granted the tyranny of 
meaning, a questioning of the authority of language.  Even given 
this stated "resistance to the established power structure," it's 
still welcome surprise how strong a presence women seem to have in 
the "second generation" coming out of (or against) the LangPo 
traditions.  It's a singular occurrence in the avant guard, as 
in the mainstream.  This presence is reflected in sheer numbers 
of women editing important publications in & around the movement: 
Rosmarie Waldrop at Burning Deck, Jessica Grim & Melanie Nelson's Big 
Allis, Lee Ann Brown at Tender Buttons, Susan Smith Nash's Texture 
Press, Cydney Chadwick's Avec, Black Box's Jessica Lowenthal & Sianne 
Ngai, Jennifer Moxely's The Impercipient...  and now, CHAIN, 
edited by Jena Osman & Juliana Spahr.  This debut issue takes one 
further step, from questioning the authority of language to 
questioning editorial authority, the filtering mechanisms that 
come between writer & reader in the form of editor/publishers.  
Most of the above-mentioned editors contribute to the discussion 
on Gender and Editing, as well as folks as diverse as Andrea Juno 
(RE/Search's "Angry Women" issue), Heather Findlay (On Our 
Backs), and Holly Laird (Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature).  
Their experiences as women editors are both diverse & similarly 
informed by an awareness of issues of power--issues that one 
hopes (but somehow doubts) is shared equally by their male 
counterparts.  The second half is devoted to another kind of 
discussion, actual Chains of correspondences between several 
writers, chain letter poems, with one writer re-sounding/ 
responding to the instigations of another, resulting in linked 
energies and exchanges that are generous & engaged/engaging.  
Here at TRR, I've avoided the usual "editor's picks" or "top ten 
lists", but I guess I'll be a man about it and put this one 
toward the top of my list of faves.  Issue #2 will address 
"Documentary," & the editorial "we" will be looking forward to 
it.--lbd

CHIP'S CLOSET CLEANER--(#11, Fall 1994), 826 Aspen St. NW, 
Washington DC, 20012.  24 pp., $4.00.  Chip Rowe's "personal 
zine" deals in "Pop Culture, Humor, Trivia, Fun."  In this issue 
he reviews various books and periodicals he's read, perceptively 
discusses the value of cuss-words, presents a quite thorough 
report on the eight-track tape scene, and reprints items he 
likes, or thinks absurd--like, 50 euphemisms for "masturbation."
--bg

CHIRON REVIEW--(Vol. XIII #2, Summer 1994), Rt. 2 Box 111, St. 
John KS, 67576.  32 pp., $3.00.  Editor: Michael Hathaway.  A 
poetry tabloid that's been going for 39 issues now. The poetry is 
mostly plaintext stuff about the day-to-day, like one by C.S. 
Fuqua about calling a girl he's interested in only to find out 
she's about to get married--strong & agreeable in voice but not 
adventurous.  Good selection here, too, of work by featured (& 
interviewed) poet Gerald Locklin--including one about "the new 
male", whose sperm-count is reportedly dropping: "hypotheses 
include environmental/ pollution and snug undergarments;//

Also in the issue: a short story, a few dozen micro-
review/announcements, and photographs.--bg

CHIRON REVIEW--(Vol. XIII #3, Fall 1994), Rt. 2 Box 111, St. John 
KS, 67576.  32 pp., $3.00.  Editor: Michael Hathaway.  If I had 
to list a hierarchy of publishers that were true to their ideals 
and truly serious about their love of literature, Michael 
Hathaway would be at the top--he's got a rock solid stance on 
poetry and fiction.  Some great in depth interviews with Ron 
Androla, John Bennett and Dan Nielsen in this issue.  And  when I 
read Kristine Sanders' poem "Hit While Running", her lines "when 
I see the bullets skimming towards/ your face I think of skillets 
burning/ eggs hissing in a pan, your eyes/ as shiny as potatoes 
cut in little squares" slapped me back in time to greasy-spoon 
breakfast hangovers after a wild night of love.  Throw in an 
excellent essay on Ron Androla by Todd Moore, long insightful 
reviews of poetry chaps that actually give you an idea of the 
poetry, and updates on literary events--this is what it's all 
about.--o

COTTON GIN--(Vol. 1 #2, Fall 1994), 1605 Wright Ave., Greensboro 
NC, 27403.  28 pp., $2.00.  Nice mix of what I call "plaintext 
poetry" and more experimental stuff.  A story by Kevin Keck 
called "In a Waffle House With Jesus" (a Bruce-Jay-Friedman-sort 
of jest, but funny in fresh ways) shares one page with a Paul 
Weinman/White boy analysis of beer commercials.  Very nice full-
color illustration by Laura Dawn Roberson on the front cover, 
too.  It's labeled "special" and consists mainly of 42 solid blue 
circles surrounded by white, arranged to form a rectangle--not 
very exciting-sounding but oddly absorbing.--bg
     Like a garage band on the verge of breaking out.  What's 
special about COTTON GIN is that, amongst other things, they 
publish song lyrics--how many zines are doing that?  What's 
special about song lyrics is that they tell a story, and when the 
lyricist is a Southerner that story's likely to teach a life 
lesson, a life lesson with universal relevance.  Such is the case 
with Chip McKenzie's "Dear Amelia" and  Tami L. Conner's "Angels 
in Bluejeans" is, simply, perfect.--gvstat's at once susceptible 
and vulnerable.  Laura Dawn Roberson's "Collage 59" uses excerpts 
from I Corinthians, lauding honesty in love.  And Tami L. 
Conner's "Angels in Bluejeans" is, simply, perfect.--gvst

CROTON BUG--(# 3), PO Box 11166, Milwaukee WI, 53211.  76 pp., 
$8.00..  Bob Harrison, editor.  Contributors include: Anne 
Tardos, Clemente Padin, Gil Ott, Ron Silliman, Franz Kamin, 
George Quasha, Paul Dutton, Jackson Mac Low, Juliana Spahr, 
Richard Kostelanetz, Eva Festa, Ge(of Huth), Sheila Spargur, Jeff 
Poniewaz, Marina Pillar Gipps, Bruce Andrews, John M. Bennett, 
Kimberly Lyons, among others.  If you find the contributors 
interesting already, the present works won't let you down.  If 
they don't interest you, this magazine probably won't do much to 
change your mind.  A major feature of this issue is the close and 
sagacious integration of work with a semantic base with work 
based in visual principles.  Spanish language work sometimes 
includes English translation; sometimes, as in the case of work 
by the Uruguayan mail artist and visual poet Clemente Padin, 
translation isn't necessary.  CROTON BUG has been consistently 
worth reading through its first three issues--a pretty good 
record for any new zine.  Poetry well chosen.  Not only a zine to 
check out now, but to watch in the future.--ky

DIE YOUNG--(#7, Aug. 1994), PO Drawer 44691, University of 
Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette LA, 70504.  $3.00.  Editors 
Skip Fox and Jesse Glass have assembled their strongest issue to 
date.  DIE YOUNG #7 is a lucky one.  Those within: Stephen 
Petoff, Stephen Ellis, Stephen Thomas, Susan Smith Nash and Susan 
Best and Spencer Selby.  Also the poetry of Kevin Killian and 
Kenneth Warren marks what words as art can form.  And there is a 
chapbook supplement and translations from Finnish, Polish and 
Spanish.  Yes, all good fish in a dish and nothing much more to 
wish.  The poet Robert Gregory, first from Pittsburgh and last I 
heard from South Florida (who by the way is one of the ones who 
will last) kinda sums this issue No. 7 up: "although people are 
standing still, the wind tastes like milk/ and the world is 
dancing inside itself as always."--mb 

DREAM WHIP--(#1, 1994), PO Box 53832, Lubbock TX, 79453.  24 pp., 
$2.00 (?).  This is an interesting chap filled with scraps of 
dreams.  It runs the gamut of nightmares, astral projection to 
other lands, fears of losing all control in situations where 
you're a pawn, contemplations on death, earthquakes and tornadoes 
and other natural disasters, and infatuations that seem to avoid 
becoming real situations.  This short publication really does 
feel like the world of dreams, with those short jerky awareness 
that you tell yourself to remember, but can't seem to hold onto 
in the morning.  Send them your dreams and see if things start to 
happen.--o

DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES--(#43, 1994), 1300 Kicker Rd., Tuscaloosa 
Al, 35404.  20 pp., $2.00.  Urgency balled up into a package of 
fantasy and surreal poetry.  The mood here is melancholic, 
desperate, coming full steam from the dark core of the brain, 
bubbling up from the brain stem: sorceresses, wolves, 
transmogrification, atonement, broken flesh, urchinesses, savage 
sub-species, solar winds, worm webs, succubi, and resurrection 
are just a few of the horrors found here.  What is created is a 
chilly acute publication with an oddly internalized focus and 
sense of pressure.  The shorter pieces are honed to a taut and 
dynamic edge.  This zine cuts to the Gothic quick.--rrle

DREAMTIME TALKINGMAIL--(#6, Summer 1994), Rt. 2 Box 242W, Viola 
WI, 54664.  40 pp., $3.00.  Miekal And, Liz Was, & Patrick 
Mullins, editors.  Not a poem in this magazine but this is the 
map of poetry (perma) culture.  Where progressive imaginations 
exist, like Dreamtime Village, art is all things.  Soul sings.  
Being involved in place, merging with the natural, living in the 
nature of it all: it is all a poetics.  Be free.  Anarchism has 
always been a part of part (look it up: Jackson Mac Low, Robert 
Duncan).  So to Utopianism: Walden Pond.  Don't get drunk on the 
Paris Commune or lost in Shelley and Byron: We have got it here.  
Wake up.  Support.  Get with the program--this ain't Shake & 
Bake.--mb 
     Life as experiment as art as documented here.  Theory, 
correspondence, discussion of how we might sustain ourselves 
creatively and without damage to the environment.  Articles here 
by Hakim Bey on social disintegration and the possible details 
thereof, and Liz Was on learning from illness, color, number and 
generally the magic of being alive and knowing it, continue the 
work the Xexoxial folks have been doing now for twenty years.  
There are also reviews, events and much else.  By living beyond 
the normal delusions and abstractions the inhabitants of 
Dreamtime Village suggest what might be possible if we pursue an 
ethic of self-reliance and life as experiment as art asx--jb

DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG--(#13, Summer, 1994), PO Box 25760, Los 
Angeles CA, 90025.  24 pp., $1.70.  I don't think I've ever seen 
a small press reach so far, and build such a strong foundation, 
in such a short period of time.  But Mike has pulled it off, 
grabbing writers that count into his PO Box so fast you'd think 
there was a creative suction device sucking all of this energy in 
his direction.  How else could he get the likes of Terry Everton, 
Lyn Lifshin, Cynthia Hendershot, Ana Christy, Todd Moore, 
Howington, Androla, Weinman, and C.C. Russell into one envelope 
without a dozen injuries.  This is one of those presses that 
makes you know what is going on, whether you want to know or 
not.--o 

DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG--(#14, Summer 1994), c/o Mike, PO Box 25760, 
Los Angeles CA, 90025.  32 pp., $2.25.  Mike keeps coming back 
for more, tearing up the streets of LA with a publication that 
has some of the best sucker punches ever thrown by Todd Moore, 
Mark Weber and Ron Androla.  Even Ana Christy's "post office" 
strikes home, with lines like "i'm a poet in drag and what about 
my nails?" and "but they hired me a woman (i wanna bitch)". The 
excerpt from Cynthia Hendershot's upcoming novel "Body" makes me 
want to tie her up, tight, and tell her about the things that 
make me happy.  This is a fine read, filled with the things you 
expect to find from some of the best small press writers 
around.--o

DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG--(#15, Fall 1994), UBP, c/o Mike, PO Box 
25760, Los Angeles CA, 90025.  30 pp., $2.50.  I remember reading 
a contributor's column in a lit mag years ago that said when Lyn 
Lifshin is good, she is damn good, and in "Falling Not Far From 
the Tree" we get "My dad,/ the loins of my fruit,/ divorced his 
wife, my mother,/the fruit basket,/ and married a big-screen TV".  
Kurt Nimmo screams at us from the shadows of America, capturing 
the fucked up aspects of a world gone so wrong it can't do no 
more wrong no more, and C.C. Russell's "Red Mustang, Gravel Dust" 
("We haven't talked/ in over a month/ so I call you up/ and say/ 
'If we can't talk,/ can I at least have my clothes back?'") 
brought back experiences I would have rather done withou.  With 
Todd Moore, Paul Weinman, John M. Bennett, and even Howington, 
this is real entertainment and a read that won't easily go 
away.--o

DROP FORGE--(#3, 1994), 13450 Mahogany Dr., Reno NV, 89511.  
32 pp., $2.50.  (e-mail--seanw@shadow.scs.unr.edu)  A well paced 
mix of prose, poetry, collage, drawings, and computer visuals.  
The writing is often delightfully scatological bordering on 
magical.  Often the prose is at least as inventive as the poetry.  
Keil Winchester's hysterical invention of a summit of best-
selling authors in Transylvania to critique the late Bukowski has 
the whole crowd mumbling glossolaic poesis that actually is a 
vast improvement over what any of them have written.  This is a 
great otherstream mag.  Check it out.--jb

DUSTY DOG REVIEWS--(#18, Summer 1994), 1904-A Gladden, Gallup NM, 
87301.  15 pp., $2.00.  Twenty-one quirky, sometimes runaway but 
always interesting reviews of small and micro-press poetry.  The 
taste of its sole reviewer, David Castleman, runs to dominant-
mode poetry, but he does not neglect otherstream material, and 
fully engages everything he writes about.  And he always fairly 
quotes from what he reviews, to give us a chance to judge it for 
ourselves.  Here's the first line from his review of Steve 
Richmond's Demon Country: "Mr. Richmond sends onward another of 
his delightful and very casual, insistently iconoclastic memoirs 
chockful of rambling poeticalities many of which might easily be 
honed into close dense poems, which he will not do."--bg

EAT POOP!--(#23, Summer 1994), 193 N. 5th Street #A, San Jose CA, 
95112.  36 pp., $3.00.  Nathan Nothin', editor.  Bell's cover art 
of Bukowski made me a lover of this zine immediately.  Then, as I 
slowly wandered into its pages and saw the likes of Howington ("A 
guy sat at the bar and he told me he didn't have a gun so I gave 
him one of my guns."), Nate's "We're All Gonna Die In The End", 
bootlegged photos of Buk lifting weights (all of fifteen pounds 
worth), and obnoxious music reviewz and comix, I knew I was on 
familiar ground.--o

ELECTRIC REXROTH--(#2), Tetsuya Taguchi, 8-35-314, Tsuchiyama-
cho, Nada-ku, Kobe, Japan, 657.  142 pp., $25.00.  Journals 
devoted to important literati usually contain scholarly articles, 
biographical notes, etc. on the figure after whom they are named.  
This one has very little commentary on Rexroth.  A bibliography 
of Rexroth studies since 1982 by Morgan Gibson contains only 22 
entries.  Rexroth was not the kind of poet who left a lot for the 
mills of academe to grind out, as did, say, Pound or Zukofsky.  
The result in this instance is a miscellaneous collection of 
beats, neo-beats, & near minimalists, often presented in 
bilingual format.  For me, Sharon Dubiago turns in the best 
poetry, though others might prefer contributions by Robert Bly, 
Cid Corman, John Solt, Ira Cohen, James Laughlin, Nina 
Zivancevic, or a dozen other poets.  Perhaps this nicely 
designed, small format magazine does a better job of paying 
tribute to Rexroth than a scholarly journal could do.  It would 
do better if it weren't so outrageously priced.--ky 

EXPERIODDICIST--(1994), PO Box 3112, Florence AL, 35630.  4 pp.  
An issue devoted to BREATHPOINTS by Shiela E. Murphy, as part of 
the lively ongoing broadside series edited by Jake Berry.  These 
eight formally varied poems are an illuminated meditation on 
domesticity, and are remarkable in the strength with which they 
reveal a sense of self in its place--to such an extent that that 
place seems connect to all other places, or to "place" itself.  
The language is resonant, luminous, and charged:

          Neighbors

     I like about them cotton colors and their soft, engaging 
     smiles.  One woman tells me about falling (after I have 
     fallen).  Pool water in another season is young blue.  We 
     live in desert town all five of us by heart.  Is there much 
     custom (tantalize).  First run envy sequences a falderol 
     that I accept of me.  We mirror as we can.  Some beauty, 
     some sandpaper.  And release the muscles of the hand.

--jmb

EXPERIODDICIST--(June 1994), PO Box 3112, Florence AL, 35630.  
4 pp.  "Malok's Tissue Issue."  Includes another stanza of 
Malok's famed "Fuck Dirge" that begins "Fuck well all the 
whatevers," plus other inimitable poems, drawings and tabloidy 
lyrico-loony collages by the Waukau Hermit.  All kinds of mega-
yucks in the collages like these arrangements of found texts: 
"our big NOTHING Beyond beans" and "ENJOY grief: mental health 
with a grin, mental health, pink and pudgy."--bg

EXPERIODDICIST--(May 1994), PO Box 3112, Florence AL, 35630.  
4 pp.  This issue contains a first-rate set of poems by John M. 
Bennett but--to my disappointment--no author's statements of the 
kind other issues of this zine have featured, and which I hoped 
might become its special contribution to the field.  None of 
Bennett's formidable talent in illumagery is on view here, 
either, but, hey, the poetry makes up for any lacks--like where's 
"Where's tall-lurched doubting's yearned!"'s at the bottom of the 
last page.--bg

FACE THE DEMON--(#1 July/August 1994), 3077 Gardner Creek Rd., 
Dickson TN, 37055.   28pp.  D. Madgalene, editor.  A lot of faith 
and a lot of fantasy here.  Starts off with a couple of poems 
praising God, and then does a 180 degree reversal to poems 
centered on Gen-X pro-suicide, prison, go-go bars, the atom bomb, 
sixties revivals... even a poem about a tractor pull.  This is a 
mixed bag, sometimes intense, sometimes fuzzy, always shifting 
focus.  Rod Farmer and Tom House have poetry here, in their work 
the reader can feel the intensity, the spontaneity, of the poem.  
Overall, this publication is effective in a passive/aggressive 
sort of way.  And I suppose I can ignore the rough sketch of the 
masturbating Republican elephants in the centerfold.--rrle

FACTSHEET 5--(#53, 1994), PO Box 170099, San Francisco CA, 94117.  
134 pp., $3.95.  Seth has finally given up on the Herculean task 
of promising to review every-fuckin'-thing that comes in, and 
that's probably necessary for him to survive &/or keep his 
sanity.  And he's come under attack lately for reviews that miss 
the mark--the inevitable result when you go for breadth of 
coverage rather than depth.  But no other publication comes close 
to matching the broad reach of zines that FACTSHEET 5 covers, 
from anarchy to Zen (and Bob, Bondage, Comix, Girlzzz, Punk, 
Queer, SciFi... etc. in between)--with particularly strong 
coverage of quirky, fall-between-th-cracks kind of stuff.  
Still an indispensable, if not-quite-"definitive", guide to the 
zine revolution.--lbd

FEEDBACK--(#17, Summer 1994), PO Box 2, Gibbon NE, 68840.  
14 pp., $1.00.  On the surface you'd think this was a fanzine, 
but after a few paragraphs you realize that there is an 
intelligent conscientious woman taking on the world here.  And 
tho this is DIY made to look slick, under all the veneer is one 
of the strongest editors I've seen in a long time.  Tho it's a 
one (wo)man show, contributors from all over the place, and it 
has a vicious free-wheeling love of controversy.  At the same 
time, it's so real and rational that I felt like I'd just dropped 
into a party of old friends, instead of being tossed into a room 
filled with strangers.  If you want fiction, articles, poetry and 
reviews of music and books, this is a down home great place to 
be.--o

FEH!--(#17), 200 East Tenth Street #603, New York NY, 10003.  
$3.00.  There's been a shakedown at FEH! Namely Simieon and 
Morgana, the editors, have split, so I suspect this may be this 
last issue in the current form.  But knowing Simeon, who will 
remain as sole editor, things will only worsen--with FEH!, this 
is a good thing.  The high & noble herald of all that is odious 
and profane, this issue turns in some real gems in the garden of 
foul delights.  Al Ackerman's "Lamentable Haircut" suggests a 
"linguini wig"; "Leper's Orgy" by Ian Ayers reminds us that if 
you're a leper you'll likely attend only one; and the holy script
of "GOB" comics is a mutant of pure offense.  This stuff will 
pervert every decent impulse you ever had.  You'll become rude, 
obnoxious, the bane of your family and friends.  I recommend it 
highly, and soon!--jb

FIRST INTENSITY--(#3, 1994), PO Box 140713, .  , $9.00.  This 
magazine presents a gathering of solid poem work.  No trash.  
No self-serving ego get ahead show boat editorial I publish your 
poem and you will write me a blurb junk.  No ass kissing.  No 
sleep with me I slept with Walt Whitman bull poetics.  Unafraid 
the red giant stars shine with the twinkle twinkles.  Writers 
have batches of work.  Within No. 3: John Yau (writing fiction), 
Robert Kelly, Theodore Enslin, Diane di Prima, and Susan Smith 
Nash, Clark Collidge, Will Alexander.  A community of writing.  
See great poetry on Michael Boughn, Leonard Schwartz, George 
Albon pages.--mb 

FOUND STREET--(Vol. 3, Summer 1994), 2260 S. Ferdinand Ave., 
Monterey Park CA, 91754.  26 pp., $3.00.  The usual wide range of 
otherstream material including one of Cliff Dweller's found-
headline poems, which includes the following three lines: "Angels 
handcuff/ themselves to trees,/ knowing when to be gracious", and 
Crag Hill's resonant pwoermd "Travellled." Also, a couple of 
collages by Steven Hartman--in one, a man (whose head is a 
partially cut-open... squash?) seems deep in thought in front of 
a greatly-enlarged cut-away section of epidermal tissue, while a 
sphere out of a solid-geometry textbook hangs in the sky above--
the combination speaking eloquently if mysteriously about the 
flesh and (Platonic?) abstraction.--bg

FROZEN HYPNOSIS--(#9), c/o Malok, Box 41, Waukau WI, 54980.  (or 
c/o Bern Porter, 22 Salmond, Belfast ME 04915).  free or trade.  
FROZEN HYPNOSISis an ongoing collage collaboration between two of 
the genre's finest.  They do to media essentially what media does 
to us--they rip it to shreds and reassemble the pieces, in the 
process allowing us to see how images are connected to produce 
desired results.  As the title suggests, what we have here is a 
snapshot of indoctrination in process.  It does nothing less than 
gives us an opportunity to reconsider what is happening and maybe 
reassess what we do with what we are asked to swallow.  More 
liberating in a few pages than any politician could manage in a 
lifetime. --jb

FUEL--(#7, Spring 1994), PO Box 146640, Chicago IL, 60614.  
66 pp., #3.00.  Andy (that's Ms. Andy for those of you who don't 
know) Lowry's back with another, and I should say the damn best 
yet, issue of FUEL.  David McCord (San Francisco's sweetheart) 
kicks us in the reproductive organs with a story that, well, 
makes a married man wonder if he can trust his wife.  Kurt Nimmo 
strikes with a story that brings the hard times to your door, and 
leaves the footsteps bouncing against the inside of your head.  
Dan Grzeca's graphics are, as always, powerful, and the whole 
issue leaves you with that existential confusion you get on 
Monday morning, knowing what the next five days will do to the 
little sanity you got left. This is real writing from people 
who've been through it all, and survived intact.--o

FUEL--(#8, Summer 1994), PO Box 146640, Chicago IL, 60614.  
46 pp., #3.00.  There are only a small handful of lit mags that 
incorporate visual layout with text in a balance that'd make the 
professionals scream out in jealousy, and FUEL is certainly at 
the top of that list.   Andy edits with a sharp clean eye that 
captures some of the best poetry and fiction around the country, 
then sets the words against a visual backdrop that puts layers 
beneath the writing.  In this issue Vincent Zandri's murderous 
adventures of a writer in search of a story slams the senses 
against a wall; Lisa Manning takes a boy, a knife, a city bus, 
and an apology, and makes it work just right; Michael Shores' 
illustrations make dreams into reality with edges you can almost 
touch; and John Goldfine takes McDonald's shattered economic 
dreams into a family scene that has become all too real today. 
That's just a glimpse, and there is so much in every issue you 
could almost write a review as long as the magazine. This is the 
stuff that dreams, and nightmares, thrive on.--o

GLOBAL MAIL--(September--December, 1994), PO Box 597996, Chicago, 
IL, 60659.  8 pp., 2 stamps.  Another in Ashley Parker Owen's 
dizzyingly thorough listing (400+ entries from 39 countries in 
this issue) of "all kinds of art projects, collaborations, and 
mail-art events."  For instance, you can send your mail-art 
images to an address in France and they'll be shown on French 
television. Somebody at another address wants the names of all 
those voted most likely to whatever from you high school 
yearbook.  Fun browsing for almost anyone--but an indispensable 
resource for mail-artists.--bg

GOD'S BAR: UN*PLUGGED--(Vol. 1 #3, March 1994), 112 Dover 
Parkway, Stewart Manor NY, 11530.  32 pp., $1.50.  According to 
the credit's page, GOD'S BAR is "originated by disenfranchised 
computer bulletin board poets.  Don't know how that happened, but 
there is some fine work here, beginning with editor Virgil 
Hervey's piece on two paintings of Li, the early Chinese poet, 
and a Chinese woman's response to one of them.  Then there's Paul 
Weinman's "Vegetable Sex" for which I will allow you to use your 
imagination and almost guarantee you you'll be wrong.  For the 
most part confessional, beat influenced poetry & an excellent 
additon to the genre.--jb

GREEN FUSE--(#28, Spring/Summer 1994), 3365 Holland Dr., Santa 
Rosa CA, 95404.   52 pp., $5.00.  Ecologically cynical, mildly 
satirical, liberal-activist-oriented work which includes a large 
range of PC subjects: the homeless, gun control, exploitation of 
living things and the earth itself, species extinction road 
kills, trapping, war, Jesse Helms, homophobia and the media... 
even an eulogy for Wiley Coyote.  The poetry here is often 
obsessed, pastoral, and charmingly bitchy.  But, it's also 
intense and mournful as incendiary emotions are balanced against 
poetic form.  Honest verse with a bracing message, as in David 
Austin's poem "Dear Jesse": "In this poem/ no crucifixes are/ 
submerged in/ my own piss/ ..no men are/ urinating into/ other 
men's mouths/ In this poem/ there are no smiling/ naked 
children," which goes on to provide the reader with an artistic 
victory over the arch-conservative.  Hard-edged and tight-skinned 
eco-poetry for the people.--rrle

HEAVEN BONE--(#11), PO Box 486, Chester NY, 10918.  $6.00.  The 
great value of HEAVEN BONE is how, with poems, stories, articles 
and graphics, and pieces that contain elements of some or all of 
these, it opens the door into the other world.  We are so 
accustomed to degenerated commodity that passionately open 
imagination seems almost insane.  But HB provides exquisite 
evidence to the contrary.  By publishing material such as the 
interview here with Akhter Ahsen (who understands the 
psychological and political implications of imagination unbound), 
the translation and discussion of Rene Dumal, the divinely 
organic photographs of Paul Winternitz, as well as recent high 
poetic script by Belinda Subraman, Michael McClure, Dan Raphael, 
Diane DiPrima, among many other visionaries, the light breaks 
cleanly through the contemporary illusion of fear and malaise, 
revealing what lies beneath and beyond our paralysis.  A shamanic 
device, a Sufi oracle, a blast of authentic ecstatics, HEAVEN 
BONE is the transfiguration of the species as it happens.--jb

HOME PLANET NEWS--(#37, Summer 1994), PO Box 415, Stuyvesant 
Sta., New York NY, 10009.  24 pp., $2.00.  There are times I want 
to write NYC off and hope that my aunt in New Jersey is right 
about there being a planetary shift that will wipe out California 
and flood the east coast all to shit.  But then a new issue of 
HOME PLANET NEWS comes out and I think, yeah, none of us live 
forever, but let's put that planetary shift off a few more years.  
After all, there's a great interview with my favorite dirty old 
man, Gerald Locklin, poetry by a poet that is so prolific (Lyn 
Lifshin, who else?) you know there'll be mail flying with her 
name on it long after that dreaded shift takes places, and a 
stack of reviews that made me pick up my checkbook and order a 
handful of pubs hoping they'd send them to me before the checks 
began to bounce.  This sat on the radiator across from my toilet 
for three days as I read every word--pretty good, considering 
most publications get a day and a half at best.--o

HOUSE ORGAN--(#7, Summer 1994), 1250 Belle Ave., Lakewood OH, 
44107.  16 pp., $1.00?.  Editor: Kenneth Warren.  Work herein by 
Joe Napora, Richard Peabody, Peter Ganick, Gary Sullivan, Johanna 
Drucker and more.  And also herein a critical review of Kerouac's 
"Old Angel Midnight" by Kenneth Warren.  This is not a review 
from a passionate knight defender of the great Beat King.  It is 
a frank encounter and there should be more of this in the Beat 
Kerouac world.  Also collected herein this issue a review of Todd 
Moore's "Dillinger; Books I and II" by Gerald Burns.  He trashes 
old "Toad" with an intellectual ugly stick-pen and leaves him 
crushed, maybe hushed, with his poetic guts fading in an acid 
pool of critical ink.--mb
     Due to the editorial selections HOUSE ORGAN has a somewhat 
different feel from most other mags.  Experimental and more 
mainstream poetry follow one another on the page, and there are 
always interesting essays.  This time for instance, Eva 
Shaderowsky's "The Serpent of Chaos," and "Kerouac's Heavy Load" 
by editor Kenneth Warren.  In selecting the poetry Warren has a 
good ear for what works well together.  He manages to do it 
without coming off pedantic.  Always a good read.--jb

HYPHEN--(#9, Summer, 1994), 330 South Green St., PO Box 516, 
Somonauk IL, 60552.  72 pp., $3.95.  Out of all of the local 
Chicago magazines, HYPHEN is the only one that dances across 
the creative arenas and consistently introduces me to new turf I 
would have run after sooner if I had only known that it was 
there.  Nat Krieger's "Dying for Culture in Sarajevo" gives us 
the arts striving for survival amid an evolving madness.  If you 
want to see photos of Chicago's notorious slam poets (Marc Smith, 
Tony Fitzpatrick, etc.) and catch up on the latest news, this is 
the place to catch the action.  Plus plenty of damn good fiction, 
poetry and art (I'm still staring at Helen R. Klebesadel's 
watercolor with a bad case of jealousy).--o

I AM A CHILD: Poetry After Robert Duncan And Bruce Andrews--
Tailspin Press, 418 Richmond Avenue #2, Buffalo NY, 14222.  
1171 pp., $8.50.  A new journal (and a hefty one) edited by 
William Howe.  As you can hear from the sub-title it is a far 
gazing and inquisitive magazine.  Work by Susan Howe, Robert 
Creeley, Charles Bernstein, John Clarke, Duncan, and Andrews.  
And combined in these diverse literary roots Jeff Gburek, Ben 
Friedlander, Pat Reed, Juliana Sphar, Rod Smith, Joel Kuszai and 
Miekal And.  And there are many others, and there is an 
information here, a program of writing.  Here is a spectrum of 
representation.  This Poem is your Poem.  This Poem is my Poem.  
From California to the New York island.  Beautifully orchestrated 
and mechanically splendid.  One of the brilliant and hard songs 
on the jewel path poemtree.--mb

THE IMPERCIPIENT--(#5, May 1994), 61 East Manning St., Providence 
RI, 02906.  48 pp., $5.00.  "Divide the world from yourself and 
you die.  See.  Separation equals contempt."--Joe Ross, from 
"Equations = equals."
What kind of fin de siecle decadence is possible after a century 
of excesses--excesses of technology, violence, and alienation?  
Optimistically, the end of this century might be marked instead 
by a re-engagement with the world--and excellent work presented 
in THE IMPERCIPIENT ("silent pillow of a generation") would seem 
to bolster that optimism.  Strong opening pieces from Jessica 
Lowenthal ("I am a Deist"), Peter Gizzi ("Imitation of Life: A 
mini series"), and Lisa Jarnot ("Diary of a Rough Trade Angel") 
confront various aspects of power (power of belief, brute force) 
and individual response/responsibility.  Lee Ann Brown and 
Magdalena Zurawski reclaim body and passion from both 
sentimentality and cynicism.  Throughout, the poems are carefully 
wrought, crafted in order to communicate (rather than merely 
obscure, or impress).--lbd 

IMPLODING TIED-DYED TOUPEE--(#3, Summer 1994), 100 Courtland Dr., 
Columbia SC, 29223.  32 pp., $4.00.  Fine collages like the front 
cover by Michael Shore and fine poems like "The Sirenes"; an 
infra-verbal gem by Gregory St. Thomasino worth quoting in full:

     aweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
     and away into

and some first-rate M. Kettner compositions, one a haiku whose 
last line speaks of "head: light as a lawn chair."--bg

INDELIBLE INK--(Seventh Edition, Fall 1994), c/o Lauren Salmi, 
3142 West Belden, Chicago IL, 60647.  50 pp., $3.00 (?).  Every 
time I get ready to write the Chicago literary scene off another 
magazine comes along that forces me to change my mind. INDELIBLE 
INK is one of these miracles, with poems that run the gambit from 
academic workshop to hard core vicious street. My favorite piece 
was "War and Marriage" (perhaps because I could identify with the 
subject matter) by Michael H. Brownstein, which captured the 
conflicts with lines like: "She followed him spouting out anger 
like launched hand grenades.  The more she yelled, the more 
insane he knew she was."  Tina Dugay-Khan captures the poetry slam 
world in "The Contest": "We were lined up/ like rival gang 
members/ Our 3 minute poems were like/ drive-by shootings/ The 
words were hot as bullets/ No truce-this time/ Let's rumble"; and 
Kurt Eisenlohr's EAT showed just how important a good meal is 
before you die.--o

INTERTEK--(Vol. 3.5), 13 Daffodil Lane, San Carlos CA, 94070.  
$4.  (e-mail: tek@well.sf.ca.us).  One can always rely on 
INTERTEKfor intelligent stimulation regarding things 
digital/cyber.  This issue consists of two excellent articles 
that meet that standard.  Editor Steve Steinberg discourses on 
"The Ontogeny of RISC" and Alex Cohen "On The Origin of 
Artificial Life--Some Assembly Required".  In the first article 
word maps illustrate the "evolution" from CISC architecture to 
RISC and the manipulation of industry and market to achieve this 
end.  In the second we see how the criteria for what life is 
might be changed by machines who build other machines, etc. etc. 
until we are defined by something that is entirely other to what 
we now consider to be ourselves.  Stimulating stuff whether you 
agree or not.  Guaranteed to keep you on your toes (at least 
while you have them).--jb

JOEY AND THE BLACK BOOTS--(#1, Summer 1994), 718 Lewis St., 
Laramie WY, 82070-3236.  16 pp., $1.00 (?).  C.A. Miller, editor.  
For a first issue this reads like something edited by someone 
who's been around the block a few times.  Cari grabs the likes of 
Lyn Lifshin, C.C. Russell, C.F. Roberts and Cheryl Townsend, and 
let's you know up front that this is just the beginning of what 
is going to be a great relationship.  Get in on the ground 
floor.--o

JOEY AND THE BLACK BOOTS MONTHLY--(#3, September 1994), 2143 
Garfield #5, Laramie WY, 82070-4342.  20 pp., $1.00.  I enjoy 
poetry publications that carry the feel of a zine, but pack the 
wallop of a semi out of control.  In this issue, Janet Kuypers 
grabs us with lines like "I wanted to feel the sold sharp rocks/ 
cutting into my face/ and slicing my skin./ I wanted pain to feel 
good again.", while C.C. Russell's "Lover" touches the heart with 
"Somewhere along the way/ it began to feel/ like a catheter 
tube;/ pain on the way in/ at the end/ but in between,/ just an 
uncomfortable/ release."  When you add in the likes of Howington, 
Townsend, Lifshin, and comix by Phil Labrie, you got a mix that 
can only do you right.--o

JOEY AND THE BLACK BOOTS--(#4, October 1994),  2143 Garfield #5, 
Laramie WY, 82070-4342.  16 pp., $1.00 (?).  C.A. Miller, editor.  
Cheryl Townsend is one of those erotic writers that has to leave 
a wet spot on every seat she writes a poem at, and between the 
lust of friends and lovers her poems continue to explore the 
sensual world of female sexuality.  And she's here in full force, 
along with Lyn Lifshin, C.C. Russell, Mark Hartenbach, and a 
feastful of others, all redefining human existence, and making 
those who don't know wonder what the hell is going on.  This is a 
small magazine, but one that carries the guts and strength you 
need for your everyday survival.--o

JUBAL--(Spring 1994), 2 Garden Lane, New Orleans LA, 70124.   
40 pp., $3.00.  A "Literary Magazine"... with poetry, short 
stories, an essay (on Unknowing), comix by Trippin Cat, and 
plenty of b&w full page sketches which seem to dominate this 
intense yet diverse publication.  Going solely to a digital 
format in 1995.  Prowling the edges of romantic obsession is 
Colette Bennet's poem "Nightfuck," one example of the startling 
turbulence found here: "Silk against my skin/ the moon likes to 
fuck../ it's only a couple of times a year/ when the sun climbs 
on her..."  On the other hand, in Kyle Cassady's "Plague Diary": 
"You're/ giving me/ AZT and you say that smoking/ would be bad 
for me?"  Here is an impulsive energy, repeatedly jolting and 
yet, very accessible.--rrle

JUXTA--(#1, 1994), 977 Seminole Trail No. 33l, Charlottesville 
VA, 22901.  $4.50.  Editors: Ken Harris and Jim Leftwich.  The 
inaugural issue of an ambitions and impressive new journal of 
innovative writing, one in which innovation is widely enough 
conceived to include a broad spectrum of differing styles and 
approaches.  If future issues are as well-edited and inclusive as 
this one, JUXTA will become a major forum for the best and 
liveliest of American poetry.  The magazine is neatly and cleanly 
produced, perfect-bound, and includes textual and visual poetry, 
and some criticism: Susan Smith Nash's article on Language Poetry 
is one of the clearest and most balanced discussion of  that 
phenomenon I've read.  The contributors are many, but just to 
give an idea of the variety here, include Sheila E. Murphy, 
Cheryl Townsend, Hugh Fox, Marcia Arrietta, Jake Berry, Bob 
Grumman, Crag Hill, Spencer Selby, Harry Burris, Mark DuCharme, 
Peter Gannick, Nico Vassilakis, Linsay Hill, M. Kettner, John 
Byrum, Thomas Lowe Taylor...  and many others.  Highly 
recommended.--jmb
     An absolutely astonishing first issue.  The poets and work 
assembled here are some of the most provocative current.  The 
tone of the manifesto intensity of the essays is one hungry for 
blood and consummating inspiration.  The poetry has all the 
authenticity and  organism of Beat as well as the revelry of 
Blake's prophecies or Breton's automatism.  JUXTA is one of a 
handful of mags now wise to the rising storm of poetry yearning 
to be restored to its essential impetus while not divorcing 
itself from the brink of the contemporary world abyss whereon we 
must dance to survive with vitality.  As with Heaven Bone, Poetry 
USA, Lost And Found Times, and a few others, it holds the promise 
of what might be if we'll shed the scales and drink the sky 
raw.--jb
     JUXTA comes roaring out of the wilds without the look of a 
virgin, and with the feel of practiced flesh.  They studied the 
field, grabbed the right writers (Sheila E. Murphy, John M. 
Bennett, Jake Berry, Hugh Fox, etc.), and kicked out an issue so 
strong I'm still trying to work my way through it, having read 
every page to make sure I missed nothing going on. This isn't 
your usual poetic verse, but rather an exploration of breaking 
all the rules with language shifts that rip electrical discharges 
out of brain cells that aren't used to being tugged.  Lines leap 
at you with sporadic bursts of: "It's hangers and bones it's 
sticks and stones/ The weather is the handsome tarp of God" 
(Lindsay Hill's "The Method of Steepest Descents"); "It is women 
in a place where nerves converge in a central system" (Nico 
Vassilakis' "She Looks Up Mythology"); and "gripped by the part 
shriek fast/ got sweat strip and into book sheer/ roar a long 
breaklanding only slow" (Peter deRous' "Desired Trope").  You'll 
be confused, and delighted, for a hundred hours or more.--o
     Here is something new and unknown.  Ambergris floating in 
the sea of tired magazines.  And it is a goooood magazine.  A 
thing like this needed.  Reminds me of the first issue of Jon 
Edgar Webb's THE OUTSIDER: A wonderful magazine of the 1960s that 
published Olson next to Bukowski.  It is good to see that the 
editors drink wide the map of poetry.  The juxtapositioning 
includes: Spencer Selby, Cheryl Townsend, John Byrum, Hugh Fox, 
Crag Hill, Rod Smith.  If Santa Claus wanted to give poets a 
present it would be more mags like JUXTA.  The Easter Bunny would 
do the same.  And the Ground Hog.  And Venus.--mb

KIOSK--(#7), English Department, 306 Clemens Hall, SUNY, Buffalo 
NY, 14260.  An annual of "new writing" that actually emphasizes 
the experimental.  This journal looks like most academic literary 
journals: a piece of art and a title on the front, the names of 
the contributors on the back.  But a number of the names on the 
back might be familiar to the readers of TRR (but not to many 
readers of academic journals): Jake Berry, John Byrum, John M. 
Bennett, Sheila E. Murphy, Tom Beckett, Amy Sparks.  Not every 
work is experimental, and not every experiment works, but there's 
enough good work to make it worthwhile.  I liked some of the 
fiction the best: Mark Jacobs's "The Albino Pheasant", Daniel 
Kanyandekwe's excerpt from "The Last Writer", Susan Shaio's 
"Heels", and Frank Green's resonating "Scarlet Letters: Part One 
(The Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale talks about AIDS)".  Poems by 
John M. Bennett and Amy Sparks also stand out.--ar
     The poetry/literature schools at SUNY are not at all what 
one would usually finds in academia, at least judging from the 
material they publish, KIOSK being a fine example.  This issue 
contains mostly experimental, or at the very least innovative 
work.  Some Language poetry, but not bound to that as criteria.  
Charles Bernstein is here, but also John M. Bennett, Lyn Lifshin, 
but also Sheila E. Murphy.  This combination of poets could 
cudgel imagination from the rock in a heartbeat.  Very 
encouraging to know that education and inspiration do 
occasionally intermingle.--jb  

LAUGHING HORSE BROADSIDE--PO Box 2328, Norman OK, 73070.  $1.00.  
Cydney Chadwick's "Noun Descending a Fire Escape" explores the 
perversity of gender role-constructed bondage, as a woman becomes 
disenchanted with her snoring lover, "especially after you 
discover a whole wad of money stashed away in his shoe box."  
A tableau-vivant that reminds one of French new-wave cinema, 
Godard's "Breatheless", or Louis Malle's more recent incest-
insinuations in "Damage".--ssn

LETTER eX--(August/September, 1994), PO Box 476920, Chicago IL, 
60647.  20 pp., $2.00 (?).  What do you do with a tabloid that 
has too many pictures of Lydia Tomkiw on the cover?  Inside 
LETTER eX, however, it's another story, and Chicago's performance 
art poetry sweetheart gets quickly lost in the shuffle.  There's 
an excellent overview of local poetry publications and events, 
and a slobbering great review of a really bad poetry collection 
(Chicago Cherry: Wicker Park Erotica), and a decent overview of 
Allen Ginsberg's latest romp through the Loop.  This is the place 
to go if you're a poet wanting to know where to go in Chicago.--o

LETTERBOX--(#3, May 1994), 3791 Latimer Pl., Oakland CA, 94609.  
52 pp., $4.50.  Scott Bentley, editor.  Another in the recent 
crop of publications cross-pollinating between various 
aesthetics.  Stephen Ratcliffe opens w/ 8 sections from 
"SOUND/system", delicately problematizing issues of identity (of 
author or subject)--slam up against Errol Miller's self-assured 
"God Almighty, we're/ human-size, avant-garde individuals/ 
snaking through the timestream, students/ of an ideal world..."  
Arethusa Stevens' romantic surrealisms contrast w/ John M. 
Bennett's hard-edged surreality; Michael Sylvester's tale of 
graverobbers at Robert Frost's tomb bumps hard up against 
Pasquale Verdicchio's lyric travelogue of Beuyes in Italy.  It's 
a fine gray-area between eclectic & scattered--fortunately, the 
unifying factor here is the consistently high quality of the 
various works.  Praps appropriate that the binding is a fairly 
fragile scratch-pad glue.--lbd

LILLIPUT REVIEW--(#56), 207 S. Millvale Ave. #3, Pittsburgh PA, 
15224.  16 pp., $1.00.  Petite pamphlet which could, in a steamy 
laundromat situation, be mistaken for a religious tract.  But 
this is no you-are-not-alone reinforcer of existential 
abandonment:  Jim Cory's "232-9212/Tight Ass" is a warm reminder 
of the power of advertising; Scarecrow's "nothing heals" is a 4-
line whisper into a corpse's ear.  A neat little packet, 
punctuated with Rorschach graphics reproducing the experience of 
being interrogated in a windowless room by a psychiatrist gone 
ragged-in-the-mind.--ssn

LILLIPUT REVIEW--(#57), 207 S. Millvale Ave. #3, Pittsburgh PA, 
15224.  16 pp., $1.00.  A tiny booklet packed with kernular 
poems, some as short as tolek's hilarious "/more/," which 
consists of just the line: "perfect, belittled"; or the even 
shorter "NowHere" of Richard Kostelanetz.  Then there's my 
favorite contribution to the issue, Ficus strangulensis's 7-step 
transformation of a handwritten "Be" to "blank"--a visusual 
treatment of the original by John M. Bennett.  Most of the other 
poems are longer and fairly conventional, but generally enjoyable.--bg

LILLIPUT REVIEW--(#60, Summer 1994), 207 S. Millvale Ave. #3, 
Pittsburgh PA, 15224.  8 pp., $1.00.  David Wentworth, editor.  
This publication is an act of love, incredible dedication, and 
touches on what poetry always talks about being, but so rarely 
is.  Wentworth's eye for poems that are precise and filled with 
emotion is one of the finest in the small presses, and he can 
coax the best out of any poet, and give it to the world on a 
golden platter.  In this issue Cheryl Townsend takes on the Pro-
Lifers, Weinman throws white racism against a wall, C.C. Russell 
gives us Mother paranoia, Ana Christy hands us a haiku kid on 
dope.  You get the feeling that all of these poets have been the 
places they're writing about, welcoming us into their worlds with 
a light touch of words inside our head.--o

LOGODAEDLUS--(#7, Summer 1994), PO Box 13193, Harrisburg PA, 
17104.  30 pp., $7.50.  An unbound collection of verbo-visual 
pieces, several in full color, by such artists a John Byrum, 
Spencer Selby and Karl Kempton.  One example: Guy R. Beining's 
"Beige Copy: Post-Text," a collage with annotations (e.g., 
"cerebrum" and "cephalic") in varied colors around two 
rectangles, one containing a geisha in blue with a two-tiered 
red parasol, the other using the first's red and blue--and 
circles--with an x-ray of a wrist, and young-girl images... 
all to suggest fascinating things about brain function, waking, 
and dreaming.--bg

MEGAZINE--(#13, Spring 1994), PO Box 86803, Phoenix AZ, 85080-
6803.  8 pp., $1.00.  This is a wonderful ranting piece of pure 
hatred, with a prison poem by Weinman, a poem from Frank ('s 
Depression) about greyhound bus travel so close to life that my 
butt hurt from the long ride, and other scraps of anger and 
madness.  Sometimes bordering on the pointless though--to be so 
vicious without a target that deserves it.--o

MESHUGGAH--(#10, June 1994), 200 E. 10th St., New York NY, 10003.  
56 pp., $2.00.  A "special religion issue" that features this 
quote from Tammy Faye Bakker: "I take Him shopping with me.  
I say, 'OK, Jesus, help me find a bargain.'"  Also includes 
serious material, such as a little-known essay on Christianity by 
Robinson Jeffers, a caustic slam on religion by Bob Black, and an 
even deeper piece by Dr. Al Ackerman called "The Gospel According 
to Peanut Butter."--bg

MILK--c/o The Poetry Project at St. Marks, 131 E. 10th St, New 
York NY, 10001.  18 pp., $3.00.  "Signed sealed & delivered: the 
letters issue", an assemblage of correspondence to & from various 
including Bernadette Mayer, Ted Greenwald, Richard Hell, Jill 
Rapaport, Ted Berrigan (circa 1971)...  more than a little 
muttering on the difficulty of the poet life, but mostly a 
miscellany & no noticeable theme.  A bit of a Cleveland 
connection, w/ Frank Green on tour with his Scarlet Letters 
performance, Lola Rodriguez dissing the town she can't seem to 
leave, and several from or to expatriot Mike Decapite.  An 
equally random index picks out "crush," "God," "Alice Notley," 
"people," "poems," "smile," "streets," and "Wordsworth" as worth 
multiple citations.--lbd

MISSIONARY STEW--(Vol. 2 #3, May 1994), 100 Courtland Dr., 
Columbia SC, 29223.  6 pp., $4.00.  Fifteen 2-word poems, some 
illustrated (as Gerald Burns's "canned poem" and Harlod Dinkel's 
"elementary drowning"), the rest typographically or in some other 
way illumagistically-enhanced, sometimes to the verge of visual 
poetry as in John M. Bennett's scriggly-rural rendition of "corn 
belt."  A fun collection for people with a taste for minimalistic 
poetry.--bg

MONDO HUNKAMOOGA--(#8, July 1994), Box 141, Station F, Toronto 
Ontario, Canada, M4Y 2L4.  4 pp., $2.00.  A revival of Stuart 
Ross's much-missed (for 6 years!) newsletter of the cutting-edge 
literary scene in Toronto, and linked areas elsewhere.  Some 
excellent short reviews of books Ross picked up at the Toronto 
Small Press Book Fair, and a wonderfully-casual but pin-pointedly 
informative discussion by jw curry of an exhibit of illumagery 
and visual poems by bill bissett.  Also, an ad for a movie called 
"The Four Horsemen Go To Mars" (with "actual Hollywood poets!", 
among them Leonard Nimoy, Richard Thomas, and Suzanne 
Sommers).--bg

MYSTERIOUS WYSTERIA--(#6, Summer, 1994), 335 East Erie, Lorain 
OH, 44052.  38 pp., $1.00.  Ironically I often find the best 
writers and publications come out of the most unexpected places, 
and while most people would look to either coast for writing with 
an edge, there are people in the midwest and even, yep, Ohio, who 
draw blood when you touch their pages.  Here's one such, with a 
Scott Holstad poem about a stripper and dreams of rescue; Erroll 
Miller observing a sex craved female looking for another fuck 
without obligation: Weinman striking a few sexual notes, and a 
Lifshin poem I actually liked.--o

MYSTERIOUS WYSTERIA--(#7, Fall 1994), 335 East Erie, Lorain OH, 
44052.  34 pp., $1.00.  Eric Scott, editor.  In the latest issue 
of MYSTERIOUS WYSTERIA you get prison fiction by Jon R. Campbell, 
a sex poem by Lyn Lifshin ("Like The Floor/ I want you/ there 
waiting/ for me spread/ out, no bitching/ if I walk all/ over 
you..."), a story by Terence Bishop about that strange lust you 
have for people you can't have, and Paul Weinman ripping apart 
another piece of our reality.  Eric captures the best that he can 
find in each issue, and often it's the best that can be found.--o

NEW BRAND--(#6, Summer 1994), PO Box 184, Vinton VA, 24179.  
40 pp., $1.00.  When you toss great band interviews (Youth 
Brigade, Rhythm Collision), huge romantic notions by Thomas Wells 
who takes on controversial subjects like what the hell is gay 
pride and do we really need it, White Boy Poems (come on Paul, 
kill the motherfucker before I do) by Weinman, and music reviews, 
you get a damn good read by a wildman in Virginia who isn't 
afraid to throw the first punch, even if someone else started the 
fight.--o

NEW BRAND--(#7, September 1994), PO Box 184, Vinton VA, 24179.  
33 pp., $3.00 (?).  Music reviews, interviews with bands, a weird 
fucking letter columns from people you hope you'll never meet in 
person, zine reviews that call something shit when it is shit, 
and poetry from Weinman and other wired out illuminated souls.  
This is the perfect bath-tub read, a fun thing to mix it all up 
in just the right doses.--o

NEW HOPE INTERNATIONAL REVIEW--(Vol. 17 #4, 1994), 20 Werneth 
Ave., Gee Cross, Hyde, Cheshire, U.K., SK14 5NL.  36 pp., 2 
Pounds/$5.00.  Poetry without borders from poets residing in 
mostly England, but also Canada, Mexico, Austria, Spain, Brazil, 
Bulgaria, the USA... even the Vatican.  Belinda Subraman is here, 
as one of two representing the USA.  Translations and original 
script, churning ambient soundscape with tantalizing 
possibilities.  It retains some diffuse poetic grandeur, as perhaps 
only an English editor can channel it--often too floating 
and sacred for me.  "These are the eyes that never fit/ and this 
is the mouth that can't forget." chants Peter Howard in his 
mantra voice.  Still, the world needs more international vehicles 
for poetry.--rrle

THE NEW RENAISSANCE--(#27, Fall 1994), 9 Heath Rd., Arlington MA, 
02174.  181 pp., $7.00.  A beautifully-packaged collection of 
fiction, non-fiction, illumagery and poetry from the middle 
outlook of our culture, but which includes a breakthrough article 
by David Impastato on the nature and failings of "dominant-mode 
poetry.  Also a worth-the-price-of-admission set of reproductions 
of the neo-Boschian unmiddle-outlook paintings by Samuel Bak (b. 
1933).--bg

NO LONGER A FANzine--(#5, Summer 1994), 142 Frankford Ave., 
Blackwood NJ, 08012.  54 pp., $2.00.  Joseph A. Gervasi, editor.  
When someone takes on the world without flinching, and gets 
interviews with William T. Vollman (author of THE RAINBOW 
DIARIES), Randall Phillip (editor of FUCK), and even talked to 
Dennis Cooper in the last issue, you know you're dealing with 
somebody who isn't afraid to take on the crazies.  This is what 
fanzines dream of being--independent, xeroxed, DIY--but almost 
never achieve because there isn't the intelligence and gall in 
most people to pull this thing off right.  This is the stuff, the 
place, the thing you got to see, like talking to somebody you 
really want to know.--o

O!! ZONE--(#12), 1266 Fountain View Dr., Houston TX, 77057.  
48 pp., #4.00.  A highlight of this issue is a grittily anti-
sentimental but moving elegy for Bukowski by Robert Peters.  
Representing the opposite end of the overt-passion scale is C.L. 
Champion's "poema cocci," which consists of four scattered 
rectangles.  In the middle of one is the word "cloud"; in another 
is a "c"; and "clod" is in a third.  The fourth is empty.  Earth, 
sea and sky... and mystery.--bg

O!! ZONE--(#13), 1266 Fountain View Dr., Houston TX, 77057.  
48 pp., $5.00.  Harry Burrus, editor-Publisher.  Thirteen, what a 
pleasant number, but not bad luck--good luck for Harry Burrus.  
Here's one that is moving it along.  Writers from about the round 
orb on which we live (some of us at any rate).  Represented 
writers from: Papatoetoe, West Yorks, Berlin, Aukland and 
Baltimore!  Well, we are all poets and here is this maga going 
all about it.  It communicates: A phone call of poetry with a 
free package of gum.  Fine cut-up collages too.  A Fine mix of 
poetry forms and no arrogance.  Obviously no one in this maga has 
a polo pony.  Some tributes to poetry of Anna Leonessa and some 
nude shots.  Some visual poems and some confessions.  Names in 
the news: Crag Hill, Bob Grumman, Ergee, Trish, Hergo and fine 
work from these: Zauta, Bertola, Akmakjian, Weslowski.  Sing 
these names and get more poetry.  Poetry-o. Poetry-ski.  Us the 
word fine a lot.--mb

ONE HUNDRED SUNS--(#2, Spring 1994), PO Box 30186, Long Beach CA, 
90853.  68 pp., $5.00.  This enticing zine has included so many 
well-known micropress poets I can't mention them all.  Suffice it 
to say that this publication is an exploration of the spirit of 
poetry in the '90s, represented in almost 40 poems, plus b&w 
collages, two-tone photographs, reviews and even three comix 
sketches.  Amid the clarity of well-worked verse and reliable 
voices is a sense of mission; to present tasteful but not tame 
poetry; to create something enjoyable and lasting.  For example, 
Todd Kalineki attempts to paint, "& made a few random attempts at 
the abstract./ Fuck this, i thought--/ nature's more powerful..."  
Todd Moore interacts with his father: "he grabbed/ my hand &/ 
made me/ touch the/ pulse going/ up & down/ on his wrist..." 
vivid images abound.  Elsewhere, Cheryl Townsend contemplates 
age, "...someone let the air out/ of my tires..."  Poetry by 
poets with focus and confidence.--rrle

OPEN 24 HOURS--(# 10, 1994), PO Box 50376, Washington DC, 20091.  
$3.00.  Buck Downs, editor.  Twenty-four contributors include 
Alice Notely, Bruce Andrews, Robert Fitterman, A.L. Nielsen, John 
Elsberg, Mark Wallace, Keith Higginbotham and Spenser Selby, 
among others--this should give an idea of the great variety of 
styles presented.  What holds them all together is a lively 
concern with innovative or intensely engaged language as the 
essence of poetry.  There is very little in the way of merely 
formal exercise here, however; all of these selections reflect an 
immersion in human experience and an active engagement with it:

     an American's
        an American's 
     lacy way around
     attire     a frozen rule
     misled stance of lessening value
     a take charge kind
     of sick, surrogate winds we got
     a situation here     dismissive
     shipment of over-
          designed blouses the forever
     shift, all grunt, gamely
        a linked-up way about him from first
     to third in no time
                         --Robert Fitterman

An excellent compilation.--jmb

OXYGEN--(Summer, 1994), 535 Geary St. #1010, San Francisco CA, 
94102.  50 pp., $3.00.  Richard Hack, editor.  This is one of San 
Francisco's serious literary pubs, and you feel a fine tooth edge 
in its editing.  With one of Arthur Winfield Knight's better 
short stories about a  run in with the traffic legal system, a 
poem about Victor Martinez's hatred of the street and hatred of 
responsibilities that keep you from the alleys, and a cynical 
bite of surrealistic reality from Richard Hack, you know you're 
on to something.  It carries an edge, and an academic touch--
proof there are still people outside of the margin that know what 
all of this is supposed to be about.--o

PEARL--(#20, Spring 1994), 3030 E. Second St., Long Beach CA, 
90803.  96 pp., $6.00.  Some literary magazines are so tightly 
structured they read more like a well edited fine tuned 
anthology, than just a small press magazine.  PEARL is one of 
these, tearing along like a wild out-of-control car looking for 
new speed limits to break, while, at the same time, running so 
smooth you forget there are flashing blue lights trailing in the 
distance.  In this issue we get some of the best stars of the 
literary presses including poetry by Laurel Speer, Tolek, Mark 
Weber, Dan Nielsen, and Robert Peters. You also get great 
illustrations by Ann Menebroker and Daryl Rogers, among a cast of 
thousands.  Add into this mixture of flammable fumes a chapbook, 
CODE GREEN, by Donna Hilbert (tasty lines like "The pain is dark 
green/ I feel it in my bask when I sleep", "I loved the flat 
sassy/ bodies of my paper dolls", and "Because I can't breathe,/ 
i try to sleep/ on the drive up the mountain"), plus Tolek, 
Laurel Speer, Ron Androla, Mark Weber, Gerald Locklin... well, 
you know you're going to be in for quite a ride.--o

PHOBIA--(#8, Summer 1994), PO Box 23194, Seattle WA, 98102.  
44 pp., $4.  Edited by Ezra Mark.  Near the end of this 
collection of otherstream collages, poems, fictions and related 
utterances are two sideways white zeros by Andrew Klimek that 
join each other against a black background.  One is larger and 
slightly higher off the ground that the other.  It takes their 
title to make one realize that they form "infinity, skewed."  
Minimal, to be sure--but full of hints of nothing/something out 
of darkness, of chains, of the elegant exactness of mathematics 
gone pathological in the subtlest of ways, of the universe in 
process...  Much else here is of similar bent & quality.--bg

PIEDMONT LITERARY REVIEW--(Vol. XVII, #4, Fall 1994), c/o 
Piedmont Literary Society, Bluebird Lane, Rt. #1, Box 1014, 
Forest VA, 24551.  44 pp., $3.00.  There are times I get tired of 
the anger and hysteria, and want to read something that gets bask 
to the basics.  When I get philosophical I read _The Art Of War_, 
but when I want thoughtful poetry I go to an issue of PIEDMONT 
LITERARY REVIEW.  Bruce Thomas Boehrer is the first poet to 
capture what Kevin Cosgriff, a friend of mine in KY, called a 
diet ("eat less food, drink more beer") in the form of poetry.  
Kathleen Thomas' poem, "The Typest", scared me half to death when 
she wrote "Speed, accuracy, and diffidence/ Account for her 
precise movements/ And bland face./ None of the executives detect 
the rage...".  A lot of these poems are, on the other hand, 
gentle, thoughtful, and bring that strange smile you can't take 
off your face when you're walking down the street and remember a 
moment only you would understand.--o

PINK PAGES--(#5, Summer 1994), c/o Joe Maynard, 372 Fifth Ave, 
Brooklyn NY, 11215.  28 pp., $2.00.  Where else would you find 
explicit digitized sexual illustrations of bondage, venereal 
diseases, sexual confessionary fictions that would moisten the 
driest surfaces, poems that would provoke the gentlest feminist 
to military action, and creative individuals who have no mercy, 
coming back for more, over and over again, until the edges are so 
rough they feel like they're on fire.  Where else, but the PINK 
PAGES?  Who else would have this kind of fun?--o

POETIC BRIEFS--(#17, August/September 1994), 31 Parkwood St. #3, 
Albany, NY, 12208.  16 pp., $10/6 issues.  Starts with a sensible 
article by editor Jefferson Hanson against the Language poetry 
bashing currently going on.  Ends with an epigramful short essay 
by John de Wit including such as: "keeping understanding in mind 
makes a poet a part-time teacher, a noncommissioned officer of 
the artistic forces" (which I like a lot, tho I'd add, double-
ahem, that keeping understanding ALWAYS out of mind makes a poet 
a lieutenant-colonel of the anti-artistic forces...).  Much in 
between that is equally fun to reflect on, into, or away 
from.--bg

RALPH--(#19, July 1994), PO Box 505-1288 Broughton St., Vancouver 
BC, Canada, V6G 2B5.  4 pp., $1.00.  I found this in a coffee 
shop, and Ralph must travel a lot because he covers San Francisco 
this time with a bit of Punk history, a Jennifer Joseph reading, 
a trip to North Beach and City Lights, and a poem that almost 
makes fun of poetry.  There's also a list of Ralph's latest 
reads, and a feeling in this short publication comes from the 
heart and travels of a man who wants to know what life is all 
about.--o

SCHISM--(Vol. 3 #11-#24, 1985-89), PO Box 2977, Iowa City IA, 
52242.  8pp. @, $10.00 (cash).  A collector's packet of back 
issues a zine edited by JanetJanet.  In "Up the Garden Path", she 
sez of it: "SCHISM was never intended to be a serious art 
movement; it was a rather slight joke.  A humorous way of 
exposing the stupidity of organized art movements."  Nonetheless, 
the 14 issues here are full of manipulations of text and visual, 
and other moves that any otherstream artist could learn from.--bg

SEATTLE SMALL PRESS POETRY REVIEW--(June 1994), 6226 1/2 Stanley, 
Seattle WA, 98108.  4 pp., $??.  Three verbo-visual works each by 
Trudy Mercer, Ezra Mark, and Joe Keppler, with critical 
commentary by yours truly.  A full range of "vizlature," from a 
textless jumble of scribbling by Mark from which one or two 
letters might be emerging, to a piece by Keppler that is all 
text--the word "err" repeated enough times to form a large 
rectangle, to something by Mercer that looks like a diagram of 
sub-atomic events somehow concerned with the origin of language 
in the half-text/half-graphic middle of the range.  A short 
survey of vizlature, and introduction to what's going on in the 
Seattle otherstream.--bg

SEMIQUASI REVIEW--(#1, Summer 1994), Box 55892 Fondren Station, 
Jackson MS, 39296.  12 pp., SASE.  Good long reviews of 
otherstream fiction (if Avital Ronell's The Telephone Book, $35 
from the University of Nebraska Press, qualifies as otherstream).  
Lots of deconstructive insight--and extra helpfulnesses such as a 
note that there's an interview of Ronell in RE/Search #13 for 
those interested.  Halfway through a sequence of highly 
idiosyncratic langpo/haiku responses to a ballet competition 
begins a flourish of improvisational riffs on various artworks 
and who knows what else that are good reading but not 
illumination as criticism, if that is what they were intended to 
be.--bg

SHEILA NA GIG--(#9, 1994), 23106 Kent Ave.,, Torrance CA, 90505.  
100 pp., $6.00.  This yearly publication can be counted on to 
yield high-energy poetry every time.  In this issue, along with 
poetry by Charles Webb, Gerald Locklin, Lynn Lifshin and others, 
we have three poetry contest winners with two representative 
poems from each.  Plenty of conscious space in this publication, 
and each word is boiled down to it's essential nucleus.  When 
Ilie Ruby tells of her sister in one poem called "Triple Slut," 
"Sister had a way/ of peeling the sun from the sky/ with a 
word..."  we can feel her torment, see the sibling rivalry.  Most 
of these poems are earnest and piercing; for example, Candace 
Moore tells us of her personal abuse; "I'm willing/ to be beaten.  
Your bruises are like/ trophies..."  No sappy innocence here, a 
verbal alchemy of free verse resides on each page.--rrle

SHIT DIARY--(#12), USF #3182, 4202 East Fowler Ave., Tampa FL, 
33620-3182.  44 pp., $1.00.  Setting the tone for this issue are 
a black-comedy tale by Andrew Urbanus about a wack who is 
literally shit on (and into) at some kind of sadistic 
fraternity's night of entertainment, and a nutty story by Tom 
Lavignino about a guy who gets his kicks sneaking into a woman's 
apartment and leaving his unflushed turds in her toilet.--bg

SHIT DIARY--(#14), USF #3182, 4202 East Fowler Ave., Tampa FL, 
33620-3182.  $1.00.  Editor Surllama has had a bit of address 
trouble lately, so you might try sending any funds or queries to 
Surllama, c/o Kevin D. Kelly, just to make sure it reaches him.  
This issue is yet another howling fine bowl full, including a 
delightful pic of child turds described as, "Two Californias and 
the Panhandle of Texas."  Now where else are you going to find 
something like that?  There's a couple of steaming wonders by 
Willie Smith including a murderer who drowns his victim in a 
toilet and goes on to become a preacher.  "The Dervish Unwinds" 
by Bill Kaul-puta is a tale of grisly science with roadkill.  
After that the mag gets weird.  SHIT DIARY has become a very 
unique place to be, very tasty--like giving your lover head and 
he or she farts in your mouth and you cum instantly.  It's just 
that intense.  An enema for the soul.--jb

SHOCKBOX--(#10, Summer 1994), PO Box 7226, Nashua NH, 03060.  
58 pp., $3.00.  Editor: C.F. Roberts.  Some of the small press' 
most vicious psychopaths (Cynthia Hendershot, Robert W. 
Howington, Blair Wilson, Gerald Locklin, Paul Weinman, and 
another thirty or more equally dangerous souls) flying at you, in 
page after page of rabid euphoric hysteria.  Alfred Vitale's 
fight between his parents (YOU JAB ME???WITH A KNIFE???FUCKIN' 
CUNT.. .I'LL") reminded me of the fights I never saw as a kid, 
and even Chicago poets like Batya Goldman get to fart and go to 
Heaven in this world.  This is writing from the edge--the knife 
edge, not the artsy avant-garde.--o

SHORT FUSE--(#58, Summer 1994), PO Box 90436, Santa Barbara CA, 
93190.  24 pp., $1.00.  One of those electro-dynamic every-
square-inch-crammed free-on-the-streets poetry & graphix 
publications.  Mostly dark, as inna poem by Edward Mycue whose 
lonely protagonist should spend the night at a motel but can't 
bring himself "to fill/ any empty room/ between two sets/ of 
lovers."  Good otherstream work by the usuals (Jake Berry, Guy R. 
Beining) too.--bg

SILENT BUT DEADLY--(#4, August 1994), USF #3182, 4202 East Fowler 
Ave., Tampa FL, 33620-3182.  24 pp., $1.00.  More critiques by 
subscribers to this equivalent of a poet's workshop.  The poets 
whose work is treated this time are E.E. Cummings, John Be. 
Denson, C. Mulrooney, and Jake Berry.  Lots of hilariously dumb 
critiques, plus a worth-th-price-of-the-issue spoof of High 
Literary Seriousness by Eel Leonard (aka Dr. Al Ackerman).  Great 
reading for those with a sense of humor who enjoy reading about 
literature.--bg

SILENT BUT DEADLY--(#5, October 1994), USF #3182, 4202 East 
Fowler Ave., Tampa FL, 33620-3182.  28 pp., $1.00.  Poets 
critiqued in this issue: John M. Bennett, Gabriel Monteleone 
Neruda, Tom "Tearaway" Schulte, and yours truly.  C. Mulrooney 
claims he hasn't gotten any poems to criticize, "just a bunch of 
bric-a-brac junkmail, because the editor can't tell the 
difference"; he proceeds to "criticize" the poems with poems of 
his own & others.  Robert Peters calls Bennett's poem "horrible, 
horrible."  And like that.  The usual much fun; and tho I enjoyed 
being the victim of critique, I was disappointed that Bennett got 
it worse than I did.--bg

SITUATION--(#7), 10402 Ewell Ave., Kensington MD, 20895.  16 pp., 
$2.00.  A simple but cleanly produced compilation of poetry and 
texts by eight writers, all of which (according to editor Mark 
Wallace) address the "possibility of identity" in "formally 
innovative" ways.  The innovative strategies here are largely of 
the neo-Language type, to use a term of less stylistic than 
associational meaning.  The selection of texts is excellent, 
showing a wide variety of approaches, from Sterling Plumpp's 
incantational "Mfua's Song," to Ron Silliman's obliquely related 
prose paragraphs, to A.L. Nelsen's elusivly framed examination of 
character, to Kevin Killian's dialogic invocations of popular 
culture and language.--jmb
     Includes Ron Silliman's "Under," a section of his long 
project _The Alphabet: all the high fizz of surrealism and jump-
cut langpo--and even lyric grace at times, as in: "The trees at 
first catch, then amplify, sounds of the storm.  Baby at the 
stage when he can pull himself up but not take a step without 
support."  A funny short play about Barbara Hutton by Kevin 
Killian--strikes me how far the Language poets swerve from 
newsprint for diction, tho to it for subject matter. The other 
good items here once again confirm the position of SITUATION 
among the best outlets for langpo and related materials 
going.--bg

SMALL PRESS REVIEW--(Vol. 26 #7, July-August 1994), PO Box 100, 
Paradise CA, 95969.  40 pp., $5.00.  The annual double issue, 
edited by Laurel Speer, devoted to the observations of a handful 
of small press (never micropress) editors.  These people always 
say the same kind of things, but I always enjoy reading them--for 
that matter, I always say the same kinds of things myself when 
asked to comment on my experiences as a publisher).--bg

SPIKE--(#4, 1994), PO Box 20183, Boulder CO, 80308.  90 pp., 
$8.90.  Peter Lamborn Wilson's essay "The Wild Man," identifying 
the American myth of white man turning into a "savage" Indian as 
central to our cultural psyche, appears half-way thru this 
collection, and it seems relevant to other of the work here--
Coyote, & various western/wilderness settings, show up in more 
than a couple of poems; while Adrian Louis's "Ancient Acid 
Flashing Back" poems extend the psychedelic generation's claim on 
an LSD/shaman connection.  Several pieces each from a dozen 
contributors, including Charlie Mehrhoff, Jack Collom, and Bruce 
Barrows.  LA performance poet Akilah Oliver successfully 
translates her impressionistic word collages to print.  And Tom 
Cooper's longish "Ides of March Poem" is upstaged by the 
preceding series of four photographs--in the first three, he's 
holding signs that read, serially: "Hello," "I have AIDS," "Now 
you see me..." & of course, in the final frame he is gone.--lbd

SUBTEXT--(#1, Summer 1994), PO Box 23194, Seattle WA, 98102.  
44 pp.,  $3.  One particularly nice thing about this magazine is 
that it includes statements about their craft by most of it's 
(Seattle-based) contributors--through not by Kirby Olson, whose 
entire contribution, in quotes, is "POETICS: hatred disguised as 
gentle comedy; gentle comedy disguised as hatred."  The poems and 
fictions are wide-ranging and risk-taking, as in this excerpt of 
an excerpt of Tom Malone's "Puget Safe," "by wind structed/ obser 
light/ rapid light brances/ on shore up"; excerpts from Ezra 
Mark's NARTHEX; and John Olson's "Fluorescent Frontier," which 
begins with a "laryngeal jalopy."--bg

SYNAESTHETIC: A JOURNAL OF POETRY, PROSE, AND MEDIA ARTS--(#1, 
Spring 1994), 178-10 Wexford Terrace, Apt. 3D, Jamaica NY, 11432.  
$7.00.  Alex Cigale, editor.  The debut issue of a literary 
journal devoted to "found forms found text" (this issue includes 
some photography, which raises the question of whether or not all 
photography is "found" art).  Most of the texts are presented as 
poems, and involve some degree of manipulation and/or selection 
by the artist.  In some cases the source of the material is 
indicated by a note, but in others there is no such information: 
in the latter cases the texts often sound rather flat, which 
suggest that the detailed knowledge of a poem's "foundness" plays 
a major role in its aesthetic success.  In spite of the 
occasional dull moment, however, there are many excellent and 
stimulating contributions here--for example, the work of Rochelle 
Lynn Holt, Tony D'Arpino, Sesshu Foster, Halvard Johnson, Bennett 
Capers, Jesse Glass, Gary Aspenberg and John Bradley.  This 
journal is an important contribution to the literary scene in its 
focus on found technique as a serious process in contemporary 
writing. It is professionally produced in large format, typeset, 
perfectbound, with well-reproduced photographs.  I look forward 
to future issues.--jmb

TAGGERZINE--(#5.5, Spring 1994), PO Box 632952, San Diego CA, 
92163-2952.  28 pp., $2.00 (?).  I love the layout of this 
magazine, with clean white space offsetting the words and art.  
There's a conscientiousness to it, with a touch of love and 
dedication.  Weinman's playful gory rabbit killer poem showed his 
taking on new territory, which renews my respect for his creative 
tendencies going another eight steps up the road. Adrienne 
Droogas' piece, "I Was Raped Today," was so powerful, so 
spontaneous, that lines like: "I washed and I washed and have yet 
to cleanse myself with tears", "I don't want to hear your voice 
and taste you in my mouth", "I don't want this smell in my room 
anymore", still echo in my head.  Frank B. Hobbs' "Achey Breaky 
Dreams" capture bits and pieces that create a gestalt of the 
senses, and the graphics compliment, don't over-ride the words.  
This is a balance that most publications should learn: that anger 
tempered with insight and well written words rips apart the 
senses more than anger overwhelmed by noise.--o

TALISMAN--(#12, Spring 1994), PO Box 1117, Hoboken NJ, 07030.  
262 pp., $6.00.  A central publication for American poetry.  Each 
issue features a wide and deep selection of various new poetries, 
and also showcases an individual well-known poet with samples of 
his work, critical commentary on it, and an interview with the 
poet--this time around featuring Theodore Enslin. Also here, a 
large selection of contemporary Chinese poetry in translation.  
TALISMAN may not quite have caught up with the latest 
pluraesthetic and infra-verbal poetry but it's not ignoring it, 
and it's first-rate on everything else I know about in 
contemporary poetry.--bg

:THAT:--(#18, February 1994), PO Box 85, Peacham VT, 05862.  
10 pp., $1.50.  Feature: Daniel Zimmerman's "Tattoo's for 
Proteus," a lyrical festival of intonation, symbol-making, and 
forms as fibrous as crystals shattering in the screech of dawn.  
"Lisa's Rag Doll Devil" toys with the monsters of the unconscious 
that say hey-I-won't-be-tamed: "my mother prays St. Anthony/ no.  
it's just as well."  Light-hearted juxtapositions of Greek myth, 
20th-century culture, and philosophical inquiry.  Strangely 
moving.--ssn

:THAT:--(#24, Aug 1994), PO Box 85, Peacham VT, 05862.  24 pp., 
$1.50.  Stephen Dignazio & Stephen Ellis, editors.  Issue No. 24 
is a set of work, writing, poems by Robert Grenier.  They are 
notebook poems--not poems from a notebook.  Grenier's most recent 
work uses the note book page(s) as a unit of composition.  The 
pages are unlined so that the words as material locate themselves 
in a wide variety of fashion: some approaching the non-verbal and 
the completely visual yet maintaining a link with an alphabet, 
which is a concept that is also stretched in this poetry.  :THAT: 
is always farther and for-word.  Issues 19-23 (all published in 
1994) featured: Kenneth Irby, Patrick Dowd, Stephen Jonas, 
CLayton Eshleman, Halliday Dresser, Bruce Andrews, Ray DiPalma, 
and Nathaniel Tarn.--mb

THIRTEEN POETRY MAGAZINE--(Vol. XIII, October 1994), PO Box 392, 
Portlandville NY, 13834-0392.  52 pp., $4,00 (?).  It's always 
sad when a great literary magazine comes to the end, and THIRTEEN 
was one of those publications you hoped would go on forever.  
There was always a gentle touch, an almost sensitive approach to 
editing, and while I tend to lean in the direction of vicious 
psychopathic outlaw writing, there was always a beam of light that 
caught my eye as I drifted through the poems. Often I had no 
idea of who the writers were, confused by all of the names I had 
never heard of, but there were gems shining in each issue, and an 
awareness that there is more than blood and guts and sweat to 
writing.  This issue is packed to the gills, and is a decent 
finale for a magazine that I will truly miss.--o

THORNY LOCUST--(#3, Summer 1994), PO Box 32631, Kansas City MO, 
64171.  36 pp., $4.00.  Rigorous poetry, prose, line art and b&w 
photos.  Often warm, and sensual, even humorous, at other times 
cerebral and self-conscious ranging to the dark and extreme: from 
lies we tell our children to serial cannibalism with a lot of 
fragments in between.  Not exactly focused but provocative 
anyway.  "She begs for another jolt,/ her body strapped down 
safely,/ electrodes sizzling forgetfulness," Robert Cooperman 
whispers to us, while Carl Bettis contemplates the infamous 
serial killer: "Jeffery Dahmer's/ Grown no calmer."--rrle

TIGHT--(Vol. 5, # 3), PO Box 1591, Guerneville CA, 95446.  $4.50.  
Editor: Ann Erickson.  For several years now a crossroads of the 
underground poetry scene, TIGHT collects in every issue an 
assortment of almost all kinds of poetry currently appearing.  
This issue begins with an excellent, considered piece by Crag 
Hill, "At The Louve"--the second verse: "Safe art is a damnable 
confession,/ that kneeling figure on the fact,/ for the state can 
conceive of us."  And what follows ranges from confessional, to 
descriptive, to experiment, to sentiment.  This is like a poetry 
menagerie shaped without intrusions by the editor's keen 
sensitivity for the broad diversity of poetic voice.--jb

TO--(Vol. 2 #3/4, Spring 1994), PO Box 121, Narberth PA, 19072.  
320 pp., $10.00.  Very high-grade production values with a neat 
cartoony painting by Philip Guston of a ghost-sheeted, cigar-
smoking painter painting a self-portrait of himself on the cover.  
Within is a section devoted to Guston that contains 16 
reproductions of his paintings followed by one poem on each 
painting by Clark Coolidge, followed in turn by commentary on 
Coolidge's poems by Debra Balken, a memoir of Guston by William 
Corbett, and other Guston-related material.  All kinds of other 
interesting poetry and prose, including some "sonnets" by Jenny 
Gough that do fascinating things in and about their 14 lines--
their 14 literal (plane-geometry) lines.--bg

TRANSMOG--(#13, summer 1994), Rt. 6 Box 138, Charleston WV, 
25311.  24 pp., $1.00.  Ficus Strangulensis, editor.  Although 
this is in a zine format, and carries that edge you'd expect, 
there are some damn good pieces amid the sloppy layout, which you 
wouldn't know are there unless you really dig.  There are tons of 
"found" poems, utterances from the insane, short insightful 
bursts from Sparrow, poetry by Weinman, surrealistic word combos 
from John M. Bennett, a Bob Z poem, strange disorienting 
graphics, and a friendly feel that makes you read through 
everything again just in case you missed something the first time 
through.--o

TRANSMOG--(#14, May 1994), Rt. 6 Box 138, Charleston WV, 25311.  
22 pp.  More talents new to me, like Ehel--one of whose two 
illumages comprises 25 fouled-up renderings of rectangles 
stamped, always incompletely, with phrase, "FIRST-CLASS MAIL."  
Perhaps the centerpiece here is "The Invaders," a plaintext poem 
by Robert Kelly that takes up six columns.  It begins as a 
discussion of language as "an invasion/ from outer space"--each 
word being an alien that has move into our brains.  It ends with 
the speaker having found them after many vain attempts to.  It is 
"a kind of shapely pouting silence/ a bunch of words beyond my 
grasp/ all I could do was say them so I did."--bg

TRANSMOG--(#15, Fall 1994), Rt. 6 Box 138, Charleston WV, 25311.  
28 pp.  There's something about a one staple lit mag that brings 
me back to my Boston days when Bob Z's BAD NEWZ used to haunt my 
mailbox.  Lyn Lifshin, Sheila Murphy, John M. Bennett, Sparrow, 
Paul Weinman, Jake Berry, Lainie Duro, Alan Catlan, John Grey, 
Paul Weinman, and a mailing list fly at you like a thousand 
sucker punches gone astray, making me wonder how the hell Ficus 
managed to throw so many fiercely individualistic poets together 
without having the pages shred themselves.--o
     Just crammed with sparkletic visual and verbal items: the 
best buy around for otherstreamers.  One happy specimen of the 
contents is a story by Don Webb that features sentences 
discussing themselves and the text they're in.  Example: "This 
sentence believes that no one will read this far, and so 
occasionally goes out for coffee."  New this issue (I think) is a 
short review section by editor strangulensis.--bg

U-DIRECT--(#1, August 1994), PO Box 476617, Chicago IL, 60647.  
42 pp., $4.00.  Produced by Mary Kuntz Press, in conjunction with 
this summer's Underground Publishing Conference at DePaul 
University.  Hence, it has a few pages on the conference itself--
but the bulk of it consists of strong articles whose titles tell 
it all: "Don't Let State Artists Become the State of the Arts," 
by conference organizer Batya Goldman; Merritt Clifton's "20 
Years of Collating"; Mike Basinki's "White Boy and the World of 
Poetry"; or Stuart McCarrell's "On the Five Types of Poets"--this 
last item from 1966 and thus amusingly "wrong" about the then-
just-starting Language poets, but still pertinent food-for-
thought.--bg

VEINS--(#2, Summer 1994), c/o T. Bishop, 2220 Walnut St. #402, 
Philadelphia PA, 19103.  34 pp., $3.00.  Editor Terrence Bishop's 
piece, "Tales From The Workplace," captures a dance club monotony 
with such clean precise lines you can feel the garbage ooze over 
your fingers as he writes about dragging the trash outside.  Mel 
C. Thompson's CARRYING THE TORCH carries intensity to an extreme 
with lines like: "You wanna' hear some bullshit?/ I still love 
your plump, junkie ass,/how you keep (almost) dyin' young--your 
scratchy, nervous whiskey talk."  Throw in some Nicole Panter (my 
favorite real life nasty girl), and you are on the road to a 
place so vicious that your best weapons won't keep away the 
dreams.--o

VISIBLE LANGUAGE--(Vol. 27, #4), Rhode Island School of Design, 
Graphic Design Dept., 2 College St., Providence RI, 02903.  112 
pp., $10.00.  Special issue: VISUAL POETRY: AN INTERNATIONAL 
ANTHOLOGY.  This collection came about as a result of discussions 
held at the Third International Biennial of Visual Poetry in 
Mexico City, 1990.  The general editor for the collection is 
Harry Polkinhorn, who also edited the section for U.S. poets and 
translated the commentaries of the other editors.  The other 
editors are: Philadelpho Menezes (Brazil), Pedro Juan Gutierrez 
(Cuba), Enzo Minarelli (Italy), Cesar Espinosa (Mexico), Fernando 
Aguiar (Portugal), and Clemente Padin (Uruguay).  This is not a 
block buster anthology like those of Solt or Williams in the 
'60s.  Because of its sketchiness, the collection tends to be 
more suggestive than definitive.  This is a distinct advantage 
because visual poetry in all countries has moved away from 
classic concrete into new approaches and new media, including 
computer and video poems, which can't be summarized or 
simplified.  One of the advantages of local editors is the 
capacity of several of them to be sharply critical of visual 
poetry in their countries in a way that an outsider could not be.  
As a suggestive venture, this collection is a good place to work 
from, whether for readers or editors.--ky

WHOLE NOTES--(Vol. 10, #1, Spring 1994), PO Box 1374, Las Cruces 
NM, 88004.  28 pp., $3.00.  Contented poetry with a feeling tone, 
emotional honesty rising above mere cage-rattling.  This is not 
technique for technique's sake poetry.  This tenth anniversary 
issue is richly textured and bracing: includes a German 
translation of a pseudo-haiku by Karl Lubomirski, "So many 
storms//and now/ ivy."  Rhymes when necessary, plus the 
obligatory Lifshin poem.--rrle

WORD OUTA BUFFALO--264 Summer St., Buffalo NY, 14222.  $1.00.  
Ah, yes, from the turf that was once the home of Charles Olson 
and Mark Twain we have this new magazine: WORD OUTA BUFFALO.  
This fresh magazine, now in its second issue, has as its program 
the multiplicity of poetic voices that make their home in 
Buffalo.  This is not a magazine simply cloistered at "the 
University" or restricted to friends.  Without pomp, camp, or 
bias a good sounding of all types of poetry spawned in this old 
time eastern city by Lake Erie.  Snow will not stop the Word Outa 
Buffalo.  No, the writing is not restricted to the street and 
schooly poets of Western New York.  There's a healthy batch of 
others with words that then bellow from Buffalo, among them: Nava 
Fadae, Michael Tritto, Michael Millay, and Heather Griffiths.--mb

X-RAY--(Vol. 1, #3), PO Box 170011, San Francisco CA, 94117.  
$15.00?.  Edited by Johnny Brewton.  Probably the most elegant, 
physically and visually pleasing assembling-type magazine I've 
ever seen.  A fat, 7 x 8.5" nicely bound compilation of visual, 
conceptual, and literary pieces, some of them hand-made; in fact, 
most of the pages have been produced by the artists themselves, 
who have been chosen or invited by the editor.  Included are 
several beautifully printed small booklets inserted in envelopes 
tipped into the issue.  There is really not a dull moment in this 
production, which includes work by, among others, Alice Borealis, 
Charles Bukowski, Neeli Cherkovskky, Jack Foley, G. Huth, and Ray 
Johnson.  Among my personal favorites are a collage by Eysekutz, 
a booklet of skeletons by Generic Mike, Foley's poem, a letter 
from India (in an airmail envelope) by Arun Lele, and Brewton's 
own found poem "Pharmacy."  X-RAY is a labor of love and great 
beauty and is fast becoming a collector's item.  Don't miss 
it.--jmb

XIB--(#6, Summer 1994), PO Box 262112, San Diego CA, 262112.  
68 pp., $5.00.  I always welcome Tolek's clear focus.  Here you 
got Keith A. Dodson's lines related to wearing his daughter's 
underwear and getting caught by his wife; then Wayne Hogan's 
insightful perceptive justifications for killing his wife; 
Patrick McKinnon's "Poem for Gramma Lavis"; and Lyn Lifshin's 
poem about things getting blown up and ugly.  This is one of 
those lit mags that rip open psychological scars: the brutal 
realities that are here now, and the ones you thought had healed 
over.--o

YOUR DAD IS...--(#1, 1994), PO Box 3756, Erie PA, 16508.  8 pp., 
$2.00.  Jam-packed with abraded realism where confession and 
personal perspectives converge at an eccentric depth.  We have 
Lifshin, Huffstickler, Kollnski, Kuypers, Nichols, Androla, and 
others; including almost a dozen of Paul Weinman's short but 
intense "White Boy" poems.  In this publication we are talking 
explicit rogue poetry, poems which have escaped from authority 
and tradition.  As Robert Nichols exhorts: "reality-based poetry/ 
that stretches the imagination & aggravates America/ to anarchy, 
to sexual anarchy..."  Yes, well this might be the definitive 
point.  Hard poetry for hard people and hard times.  Whatever the 
point is, this is not poetry for the weak.--rrle

ZYZZYVA--(Vol. X, No. 3; Fall, 1994), 41 Sutter Street, Suite 
1400, San Francisco CA, 94104.  160 pp., $9.00.  Howard Junker, 
editor.  Many high points in this issue: "First Time In Print" 
section, something more zines should try--of the three presented 
here, Colleen Sullivan is someone to watch, though the others 
should not be ignored; self-portraits by local artists, many of 
them funny, most intentionally so; Karl Kempton's "Om Suite", one 
of the first, if not the first, publication of Kempton glyphs 
since he went from typewriter to computer, and in the process set 
aside the x-y grid in most of his visual poetry to date for more 
fluid forms; and Sherman Alexie's "The Writer's Notebook": loose 
and free graphic and textual interaction.--ky
