CHAPS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------


THE STANDARD ARTIST STAMP CATALOGUE--PMTTTD Corporation, 4067 
Letitia Ave. S., Seattle WA, 98118-1137.  150pp.+, $25.00.  When 
I was a neurotic little bastard I used to collect stamps, but 
this stamp book of mail art stamps is a thousand times more 
organized than I ever was.  These stamps are the creation of 
artists, and although they imitate the formats of legitimate post 
office stamps, they are focused on computer generated acts of 
existentialism, collages, photo sets of contributing artists, 
bootlegged images of pornography, pen and ink bursts of madness 
and insanity, letter-bomb threats, and a thousand warring egos 
all trying to out-create each other while sticking to a format 
that looks deceptively sane on the surface.  If you found weird 
stamps on your letters during the 80s, chances are you've seen 
some of this work before--if you haven't, and you're curious 
about that "stamp thang" you heard about a few years back, this 
is a most comprehensive collection.--o

Dr. Al Ackerman: THE BLASTER AL ACKERMAN OMNIBUS--Feh! Press, 147 
Second Ave. #603, New York NY, 10003.  288 pp., $12.95.  Al 
Ackerman is a kind of Dave-Barry-gone-wrong, prevented by his 
innate creativity from being satisfied with "family fare."  So 
BLASTER, his first full-length collection, will probably not 
become a best-seller.  On the other hand, it will still be read a 
million years from now when writers like Barry have long been 
forgotten.  Of course, his readers will all be Vug-Randolphs, the 
large sentient beetles that Ackerman claims are the true authors 
of the works of John M. Bennett.--bg

Sherman Alexie: FIRST INDIAN ON THE MOON--Hanging Loose Press.  
$12.00.  A mixture of free verse poems and short prose, this 
collection of Sherman Alexie's work reflects his personal 
experience as an American Indian raised on a reservation.  The 
prose pieces work best, if only because the free verse is so 
conventional in style as to be indistinguishable from many other 
poets' work.  In the prose, recounting the stories of his life, 
Alexie's anger and pain are captured in brief anecdotal moments 
and disturbing memories.  One example: "An Indian man drowned 
here on my reservation when he passed out and fell face down into 
a mud puddle.  There is no other way to say this."--tw

Karen Alkala-Gut: RECIPES: LOVE SOUP AND OTHER POEMS--Yaron Golan 
Pub., 3 Burla Str., Tel-Aviv, Israel.  64 pp.  Karen was raised 
in America, and now lives in Israel.  Breaking the metaphor of 
silence, she tells us of family deaths and life in a war zone, 
and of Jewish hearts open to enemies of obligation.  Several of 
her poems deal with the sickness and death of her father.  The 
poems "Night Travel" and "The Train" relates a journey into 
Germany, juxtaposing Nazi horror and adolescent intrigue.  The 
long journal-poem "Between Bombardments" portrays the trepidation 
and inhumanity of the Gulf War, of living in the shadows of death 
and missile attack.  Her innocuous honesty and personal 
revelation brings us to taste her bitterness of violent 
involvement bound with the absurd.  "Instead of his leash/ the 
dog brings my mask/ to remind me of his walk." This publication 
touches a deep pulse and reminds us of those the Gulf War 
personally affected.--rrle

Minoa Alloy: NARTHEX--Vortext Editions, PO Box 23194, Seattle WA, 
98102.  82 pp., $5.00.  The author's intro to this richly infra-
verbal work suggests the reader think of its "revealed words" as 
words "retained upon waking from a dream, hermetic definitions" 
that you are to "carry... in your pocket, leave... on your 
nightstand."  A number of silences from many strands of history 
inhabit it, as in "arc arch archae// come the silence."  And 
silencednesses, as when "aria" is crossed out, then followed by 
"your vague epithet."  Later, "aria" reappears--sharing a page 
with "purge" and "cello/ plant threat."  A remarkable amount of 
inter-and intra-tonality helps one "understand the gone/ trace/ 
lostre."--bg

Miekal And & Elizabeth Was: THE MISSING TEXT OF THE LOST TOWER--
Xexoxial Editions, Rt. 1 Box 131, LaFarge WI, 54639.  38 pp.  
Combination of surrealism and langpo by And, with subtexts by 
Was.  Nonsense to the logocentric mind, but both the Tower of 
Babble and more scientifically-plausible sites of language-origin 
form and unform in the haze of the narrative.  "During the 
archaic there were no physical & mental restraints, no 
institutional boundaries around logos & all the slight 
expressions of the subtle universe," says the text near the end--
"And the brass rings" as Liz's subtext puts it at another point 
to describe the lyrical way the work uncenters us larger.--bg

Antler: ANTHEM--Beginner's Mind Press, Kingman Blvd. #6, Des 
Moines IA, 50311.  1 pg., SASE.  A plaintext poem by a Vietnam 
Veteran stating why he will no longer stand for the National 
Anthem or the Star-Spangled Banner.  Not just angry, but mellowly 
leading to hopeful thoughts about our country's becoming 
Ecotopia, whose "flag is the Wilderness/ and (whose) National 
Anthem is the wind."  One of a number of worthwhile broadsides 
occasionally being but out by this quiet new press.--bg

Amari Baraka: FUNK LORE--Open Magazine New Series, PO Box 2726, 
Westfield NJ, 07091.  $1.00.  One of Baraka's excellent musicwise 
and spiritual poems.  Originally read at The Cooler in NYC during 
Reggie Workman's "Word & Music" performances (Workman used to 
play with Coltrane, among many others).  Baraka discovers the 
blues, their origin in our selves.  "In tribes of 12/ bars/ like 
the stripes/ of slavery/ on/ our flag/ of skin".  Music returned 
to it's source body.  A strong dose where you need it.--jb 

Dennis Barone: THE MASQUE RESUMED--Standing Stones Press, 7 
Circle Pines, Morris MN, 56267.  15 pp.  If not apocalyptic, at 
least aware of the linguistic ruptures and impossibilities of 
representations.  This collection of poems is stunning--perhaps 
the influence of contemporary French poetry is somewhat more 
veiled here than in Barone's other works, which imparts a 
breathless urgency.  Perhaps some of the most subtle innovative 
poetry being produced today.

Guy Beining: STOMA--Aegina Press, 59 Oak Lane, Spring Valley, 
Huntington WV, 25704.  57 pp., $9.00.  For years Beining has been 
composing a sequence of "Stoma."  This collection contains 
numbers 1701 through 1743 (formidably inter-echoing).  A stoma is 
a minute opening or pore in a surface, and also, in medicine, a 
"mouth."  Beining's Stoma, then, are often simultaneously sensual 
mouths, and haiku-small openings through the quotidian, generally 
urban, surface of existence into lyricisms like light frightened 
into "CLOUD swells" or "the language of snow" whose grammar 
"buntings correct twig to twig."--bg

John M. Bennett: JUST FEET--Texture Chapbook Series No. 13, 3760 
Cedar Ridge Dr., Norman OK, 73072.  24 pp., $6.00.  One out of 
any two poetry magazines is going to feature John M. Bennett.  
The guy is a poem writer, relentless.  A river.  A roaring sea of 
poems smashing against us humble reader beach eyes and ears.  A 
hurricane rain of cat, dog, giraffe words.  John Machine Bennett.  
And the books everywhere also by the flock and herd.  So we have 
this one: JUST FEET.  This is one of Bennett's best.  Herein 
also, two essays on JMB's poetry, one by Jake Berry and one by 
Bob Grumman (two writers that have some clear insight into 
innovative poetics).  Well, this is a way to go.  That's good 
because writers like Bennett of the boiling underground don't 
receive enough critical comment.  We forget what the poet's 
poetry is all about.  Essays good to get new readers.  And for 
the thick reader that has to be struck in the head with a washing 
machine or cement ostrich, these essays do it.  An innovative 
idea for a book also to get writers reading each other and then 
writing and that writing going into the book.  More.  Collages 
which match the power of the poems by Brekka Hervey, Susan Smith 
Nash, and Kelly Vincent.--mb

Aloma Bloom & Jessie Gretzinger: STEPS TO FREEDOM--c/o Taggerzine 
Specials,  PO Box 632952, San Diego CA, 92163.  12 pp., $1.00(?).  
These are playful poems with playful illustrations, and strangely 
enough remind me of James Thurber.  There's social commentary, 
tons of catholic metaphorical nonsense, relationships fucking up 
in a strangely stated gentle way, aging and wisdom, and 
insightful spiritual Zen-like poems that make you think.  On the 
other hand, Zen does no more than love to change the world.  Hope 
is like Heaven, something to believe in until you drop dead.--o

E. B. Bortz: VOICES OF A WANDERER--Out There Pub., PO Box 796,  
Mars PA, 16046.  62 pp., $7.00.  An obsessive purity of line and 
form dominates Bortz's collection of poetry and short stories 
(the longest of which is about a jaunt into Thailand).  The motif 
here is that of the outsider wandering to various world 
locations: Singapore, Seoul, Germany, Israel & Montreal, as well 
as several locations in the USA.  The verse is minimalist and 
melancholy, reminding me of a wanderer infected by a solitary 
search for something.  What is not mentioned.  Like a monastic 
voyeur handing out meticulous images which transcend meaning, the 
wanderer has almost completely painted himself out of the 
picture, covering the naked heat of emotion with a refracted 
mirror of scenes which results in a cool touch.  Maybe the author 
says it best when he ends a short prose-poem with "To suppress 
the Innerself is to abdicate the living."--rrle

Jonathan Brannen: NOTHING DOING NEVER AGAIN--Score, 812 SW 
Cityview, Pullman WA, 99163.  27pp. +envelope, $6.00.  Loose-leaf 
cardstock in an envelope, each of the 22 panels of this sequence 
consists of typed repetitions of one of the letters of the title 
arranged to form a non-representational composition.  As the 
sequence evolves, its range of grays and blacks and sudden 
occurrences of negative space, and its jolts and whispers of 
forms in harmony or opposition with each other, slowly turn the 
nothing that Brannen seems at first to be doing into a permanent 
everything.  If only Brannen did his thing on canvas or the 
equivalent instead of on pages, he might be getting the acclaim 
he deserves, for no museumed user of texts in visual art that I 
know is even a tenth as masterfully not doing nothing.--bg

Andre Breton: EARTHLIGHT--Sun & Moon Press, 6026 Wilshire 
Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90036.  $12.95.  Best known as the 
spokesman and founder of Surrealism, Andre Breton also wrote 
poems that are like delicate, exotic jewels.  EARTHLIGHT is a 
selection of his work from seven collections first published in 
French.  For my money, his prose poems are Breton's most 
interesting work.  "Wearing a hooded beige cape, he frolics on 
the satin poster where two paradise feathers replace his spurs," 
begins one poem.  And it ends: "Just once can't the expression 
for life trigger one of the aurora borealises they'll use to make 
the table cloth of the Last Judgment?"  Beautiful work.  Like 
dreams should be.--tw

Kimberly J. Bright: MAENAD--Fell Swoop, 3003 Ponce De Leon St., 
New Orleans LA, 70119.  11 pp., $3.  A self-described 
"carnivorous poet," Kimberly affords us an amusing look into her 
world; a world of Prozac, cosmo girls, tattoos, post-coital 
remarks (my favorite: "do you always have so many orgasms?"), 
turning men into suicides, turning men into "sobbing little 
boys," barbiturate-induced sleep, and similarly interesting 
perspectives.  "We can make it/ look like an accident."  She 
strikes immediate and deep chords with her sparse and direct 
voice.  "I want to/ make your bones into woodwind instruments/ 
for an all-serial killer orchestra."  Her rage and refusal is 
delicately balanced with sexual and personal torments.  Both 
enjoyable and provocative.--rrle

Adam Brodsky: FILM AT 11:00--PO Box 43700, Cleveland OH, 44143.  
32 pp., $5.00.  One of the more unusual chaps I've read in a 
while; paginated in reverse, each page containing an abstract 
gray and white frame surrounding a single question: "If a bomb 
exploded is it still a bomb?" or a short poem: "I am./ You are./ 
He, she, it is./ Why aren't they?"  A totally gray centerfold, a 
couple of longer poems, and a bright insert--somehow it seems to 
work for me, with the reverse pagination acting as a countdown.  
The commitment here is to contemplation, to diversity, to 
originality, and to the absurd.--rrle

John Byrum: FORK SHIFT--Generator Press, 8139 Midland Rd., Mentor  
OH, 44060.  $4.00.  A book of graphically super-imposed texts, in 
which the bold "foreground" words could be commentaries on, or 
distillations of, the fainter "background" texts; for example the 
words "writhing nowhere intentions" appears large and bolder over 
a passage that begins "if follows clean glass place inclination 
dust designation ever..."  There are some variations on this 
format, for example several pages in which the bold and faint 
texts are graphically equal, or there is no bold text at all, 
etc.
     It seems to me that there are at least two ways of 
approaching these enigmatic and non-discursive works: one would 
be to "read" them as visual mandalas, in which the meditative 
gaze moves back and forth, in and out in a never conclusive 
movement of recombining and reordering of the words; a way of 
reading that is process-oriented and not directed toward "getting 
the point."  The other approach is to consider these works as 
artistic representations of knowledge (or "reality") as it is 
increasingly manifest in the "information" age: that is, these 
works are a metaphor for knowing as a multi-layered process, and 
not as a static body of facts and structures.
     The book is cleanly and simply presented, and includes a 
note of "sources," which are all dictionaries.  Highly 
recommended.--jmb

Robert Caldwell, Eric Dietz: THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS--Anaconda 
Press, PO Box 146640, Chicago IL, 60614.  12 postcards, $4.00.  
Andy Lowry, the person behind the wild adventures of Anaconda 
Press, bursts out of her latest explosive frenzy with a dozen 
postcards by Robert Caldwell and Eric Dietz.  The focus is on the 
four food groups: alcohol, sugar, fat and caffeine.  The cards 
scream slogan feasted rants, and the combination of stark 
graphics from minds polluted by years of abuse of the four food 
groups attacked leave one with a strange inner fear that you 
might be next.  Pictures of Klansman eating lard, killers on 
three day vodka binges, child molesters, and coffee addicts 
litter the turf, and are only a sampling of the illustrations and 
the edge they rip across.  These postcards carry a dark humor, 
and a viciousness nastiness, that have to be seen to be 
appreciated.--o

Clint Catalyst: CARESSES SOFT AS SANDPAPER--Papershred 
Productions, 4104 24th Street #254, San Francisco CA, 94110.  
48 pp., $4.00(?).  For a poetry chap with mixed illustrations 
from a dozen plus illustrators , and poems that capture the wild 
long strokes of heated lubricated love making, this is a fine 
introduction into a poet who's on a road filled with either self 
pitying whoa is me bitterness, or extreme insight into the human 
condition.  I don't know, man, maybe I've always been a cynical 
asshole expecting the worse, but I thought that these poems 
needed to go a step further.  Perhaps castrations and 
mutilations, or self destructive rituals, would have over-ridden 
the youthful angst. Perhaps a more in perspective point of view 
is what I look for when the world starts to get that looking bad 
kind of misery blues.--o

Cydney Chadwick: NOUN DESCENDING A FIRE ESCAPE--Laughing Horse 
Broadsides, PO Box 2328, Norman, OK, 73070-2328.  1 pp., $1.00.  
"Noun Descending a Fire Escape" explores the perversity of gender 
role-constructed bondage, as a woman becomes disenchanted with 
her snoring lover, "especially after you discover a whole wad of 
money stashed away in his shoe box."  A tableau-vivant that 
reminds one of French new-wave cinema, Godard's Breathless or 
Louis Malle's more recent incest-insinuations in Damage.--ssn

Ana Christy: REAL JUNKIES DON'T EAT PIE--Alpha Beat Press, 31a 
Waterloo St., New Hope PA, 18938.  66 pp., $10.00.  Ana's 
admiration of her beloved Beat roots is unabashed--road poems 
stretching frm Greenwich Village to Haight St., western haiku ala 
Kerouak's Mexico City Blues, Bebop & drug references... even the 
book itself imitates the package of a City Lights Pocketbook.  
Her opening poem is titled "My Notebook," and that seems an apt 
description for much of the work--picturesque details and clean 
colloquial language.  But unlike the best Beat writing, this too 
often fails to soar--careful observation and recording, but 
without the passionate insight or resounding echoes of the 
originals.  Not bad work, but falling short of what you'd expect 
from the self-proclaimed "poet of the counterculture and queen of 
the underground."--lbd

Glenn G. Coats: THE BIG ZANY--East Coast Editions, 105 Betty Rd., 
East Meadow NY, 11554.  20 pp., $2.00.  A set of nature-rural 
poems based on a Canadian myth surrounding a man known as "Zany." 
"The hull/ of his boat/ was like/ his face:/ brown, lined/ 
weathered."  Using precise evocative descriptions we are guided 
through an imaginary Zany's world of "hawks/ and herons," rivers 
and small lakes, pickerel and walleye, birch and hemlock.  Here 
nature takes on a haunted, surreal specter, "There are no 
footsteps,/ only water slipping/over rocks" and Zany is the 
specter, never appearing except in shadows of the mind.--rrle

Edmund Conti: HIC HAIKU HOC--The Poet Tree, 82-34 138th St., #6F, 
Kew Gardens NY, 11435.  23 pp., $3.75.  Some amusing parodies of 
traditional haiku (for instance: "Okay, all you frogs/ Everybody 
out of the pool/ And form three lines."), and other pieces of 
light verse, many of them quite infraverbally adventurous, like 
"Open Every Day Except Sunday":

     openopenopenopenopenopenope

In short, my kinda stuff.--bg

Barbara Cramer: A CHILD OF DREAMS--East Coast Editions, 105 Betty 
Rd., East Meadow NY, 11554.  20 pp., $2.00.  Barbara Cramer is a 
Colorado poet with an eye for the rigorous moment, and a voice of 
self-conscious narrative.  She narrates in varied lines her inner 
feelings mingled with a patient considerate life.  Christian 
elation regionally based and honest.  Often starry-eyed, and 
sometimes expansive: "People will adore me./ fear me,/ worship 
me,/ for I am sacred" she states describing her mystical 
personification as lightening.--rrle 

Simon Cutts: FOR MARIE BOURGET--Tel-Let, 1818 Phillips Pl., 
Charleston IL.  9 pp., $3.00.  Three very stiff white pages that 
seem blank until you realize that a line has been indented on 
each page as though typed by a typewriter with no ribbon.  The 
lines say, "the only texts/ I ever write/ were the titles," which 
is droll, and it's probably wrong of me to give the whole book 
away like this, but I haven't, because what counts here is not so 
much what the text says, but what it is and feels like in such a 
context.  This work is not a poem, or just a poem... it is a 
Book!--bg

Tony D'Arpino: PATANJALI'S TOES--Found Street, 2260 S. Ferdinand 
Ave., Monteray Park CA, 91754.  $2.00?.  Two clearly expressed 
poems presented on a small folded broadside, both of which deal 
with a sense of mythic presence emerging:

          The sex scene in the center of the
     book lifts off the page like a child's tattoo.
     The furnace in the yogi: a description and
     dossier of seasons.
                                                   --jmb

Marilyn Dammann: EPHEMERAL EARTHWORKS--PO Box 115, Baraga MI, 
49908.  48 pp., $10.00.  Twenty-four well printed photos of 
outdoor sculptures, most made of bark and driftwood.  Pieces 
constructed by gravity and placement in snow without artificial 
fasteners.  Pieces work with light and snow: the moving shadows 
of the wood are as important as the wood itself.  Hence, time 
figures into the work in two ways: transience, and time marked by 
movement of shadows.  Sound a bit like Stonehenge?  It should: 
much of Dammann's work takes ancient lyths as points of 
departure, and she has made stone cairns on the shores of Upper 
Michigan and along the coast of Ireland.  Unlike grandiose 
earthwork sculptors, Dammann avoids violation of nature, works 
according to seasons, and makes sure her work leaves nothing 
behind that might not be there already.  Several sculptures are 
nothing but marks in snow--as ephemeral as art can get.  But we 
have these haunting photos, which Dammann rightly calls "visual 
poems."--ky 

Gary David: A LOG OF DEADWOOD--North Atlantic Books, PO Box 
12327, Berkeley CA, 94701.  139 pp., $9.95.  Poetry of 
historicity--the result is somewhat tame because of its self-
consciously academic nature, but interesting nonetheless.  Maybe 
it's the cowboy in it all.  Deadwood refers to the Dakota gold 
mining rough-n-ready times, in fact, the book purports to be a 
"Postmodern Epic of the South Dakota Gold Rush."  David owes much 
to Edward Dorn, whose Gunslinger echoes throughout these pages.  
David's work reminds me of another poet, Bill Sherman, whose 
surreal meditations upon Old Mesilla bring out the gothic & the 
grotesque lurking in every ghost town.--ssn

Corrine DeWinter: WISHCRAFT--Arrow Pub., PO Box, East Long Meadow 
MA, 01028.  32 pp., $2.00.  This is Ms. DeWinter's second 
chapbook, and it is crosshatched with eroticism and death, 
affection and obsessed lust, magic and myth.  She wrenches her 
images through a screen of incantation, "I have danced far and 
wide and moved no heart."  A floating desperation prevails, 
wistful yet persistent, "Come out into the light and sing/ Your 
superstitions, come out..."  The background is eerie, haunting, 
ancient primal needs of tortured goddesses, solemn searchers and

Larry Eigner: A COUNT OF SOME THINGS--Score, 812 SW Cityview, 
Pullman WA, 99163.  8 pp., $4.00.  Four short poems in the 
inimitable high innocence of Eigner, but here with almost 
sardonic musings on numbers, particularly the number of people 
over-populating the world at present--with the "yugoslav newborn 
designated (July '87) our billionth contemporary" making two 
appearances.--bg

Urhacy Faustino and Leila Miccolis, eds.: SACIEDADE DOS POETAS 
VIVOS (Vol 5, 1994)--Blocos, Caixa Postal 25029, 20552-970 
Rio/RJ, BRASIL.  112 pp.  [No price listed, but $10 in 
international postal coupons should do the trick.]  Brazil has 
had a particularly active visual poetry scene since the mid-
fifties, when the Noigandres group started its multifaceted 
projects.  Noigandres poets did good work then, and continue to 
do so now.  But the group has also kept succeeding generations 
from emerging in print in Brazil and from being seen in other 
countries.  The present collection may be the fullest 
representation of post-Noigandres visual poetry available.  If 
you don't read Portuguese, don't worry: most of the poems work 
with icons, phrases in English, and brief Portuguese texts that 
can be read by Anglophones.  Perhaps 15% require knowledge of 
Portuguese.  The energy, inventiveness, and variety of these 
poets comes through forcefully in this anthology.  In the next 
decade, some of the poets in this volume will find an 
international audience.--ky 

Valerie Fox: AMNESIA, OR, IDEAS FOR MOVIES--Texture Press, 3760 
Cedar Ridge Dr., Norman OK, 73072.  35 pp., $4.00.  In the title-
piece of this collection of 12 poems and other texts, two banal 
movie-ideas are turned representative of the vacuity of mass 
Culture by the suggested title following them, "I really like 
that building how tall and thin it is."  The rest of the 
collection provides similar slants off popular inanity (e.g., one 
poem asks if a reincarnation of Emma Goldman would, among other 
things, "shower in Baltimore/ buy flowers for herself/ or wait 
for someone to give her/ what she deserved"--or "have another cup 
of coffee.")  The book includes "critical accompaniments" by 
Stephen Ratcliffe, Thomas Lowe Taylor and Susan Smith Nash, too--
the first of them a very indirect one since it's most about 
Twelfth Night and never mentions Fox's work.--bg

William A. Fox: GEOGRAPH--Rainshadow Editions, The Black Rock 
Press, University Library 322, University of Nevada, Reno NV, 
89557.  60 pp., $10.00.  A collection of diagrammatically 
constructed poems, visually and conceptually arranged in ways for 
which the Fibonacci series (a mathematical progression referred 
to more than once in the book) is a metaphor.  Most of the poems 
are in series, each section repeating and rearranging elements of 
the previous one, giving the poems a sense of being closed and 
open-ended at the same time, an effect which is strikingly 
beautiful:

     block     to        stack      a
     a      block        noather   to
     nother     a        a       mesa
     box      and        nother     a

Elegantly produced in a square perfectbound format on good 
paper.--jmb
     Fox continues to refine the minimalist approach of much of 
his earlier work.  Words isolated by context and by placement on 
the page often work as modular units that can be transposed in a 
singular semantic structure or one that changes by slow 
accretions.  In some instances, paired columns that are set up to 
be read vertically and horizontally add a sense of a third 
dimension to the work, reminiscent of the volume implied by 
polyphonic music.  Fox's earlier experiments with visual poetry 
are here refined into simple, thin lines, sometimes implying 
verse lines left unstated or diagrams surrounding modular texts.  
Most interestingly, these wispy, schematic lines bring out 
rhythmic possibilities in the solitary words that would otherwise 
be difficult to hear.  If the minimalism of Ian Hamilton Finlay 
and Robert Lax appeals to you, you'll probably like this 
book.--ky

Christopher Franke: =5--William Busta Gallery, 2021 Murry Hill,  
Cleveland OH, 44106.  29 pp., $1.00.  A delightful tiny 
(2.75x2.25") book of poems and visual poems, containing much 
humor and wordplay (both visual and aural).  The "price" is from 
the back of the book, which includes the phrase "Dime X A Dime".  
My favorite piece here:

     Franke did find time to write a
     poem about not having enough
     time.  He calls it "Dash."

     "On my stove are four burners.
     When I need more than four burn-
     ers, something isn't cooking," the 
     poem reads in part.

Robert Frazier & Bruce Boston: CHRONICLES OF THE MUTANT RAIN 
FOREST--Horror's Head Press, 140 Dickie Ave, Staten Island NY, 
10314.  80 pp., $8.95.  Boston and Frazier are longtime Science 
Fiction poets whose work combines a surrealist sensibility with a 
hard technological edge.  Their CHRONICLES OF THE MUTANT RAIN 
FOREST invokes a jungle gone botanically mad: "It is a Sphinx 
that lifts the world upon its back and grows./ Its veins are road 
maps that lead nowhere,/ its breath a cypher,/ its inscrutable 
eyes spin mandalas that drift and blue/ shift in toward 
Armageddon."  Eerie and evocative, these poems effectively 
explore a terrain most poets don't even realize exists.--tw


Peter Ganick: IT OR S/HE--Standing Stones Press, 7 Circle Pines, 
Morris MN, 56267.  16 pp., $4.00.  Fourteen blocks of prose in 
the most radically altered-syntax zone of language writing.  Its 
first two sentences, for instance, are: "You and I are what They 
coil from Us at a sample of Those that inept lick.  tells Them 
that usage it imperils so You can Them."  The title tells it all: 
this is a book hyper-emphasizing described but referentless 
pronouns.  The result is a tantalizingly odd secondary world, 
full of a sense of being generated by rather that generating.  It 
is experiments like this sequence that are keeping Language 
writing one of the central modes of verbal art.--bg

Peter Ganick: UNTITLED SELFKNOWLEDGE--Tight Press, PO Box 1591, 
Guerneville CA, 95446.  16 pp., $4.00.  The title seems to refer 
to a fascinating quality of these poems: they are written in a 
kind of blank, impersonal style (there are no pronouns, for 
example) that yet contain an expanding sense of self, a self 
immersed and growing in the effluvia of consciousness and the 
inevitable forms consciousness takes:

     tactics rose near floundering
     mallets and fingers
     the joiners
     first

     crises thought so tentative
     servant roses above
     the blue
     well

As in the above, the language flows through passages of 
elliptical, "depersonalized" syntax to phrases of a perhaps 
deceptive discursive clarity: seen in the context of the poems as 
a whole, such phrases become as protean in meaning and inference 
as anything here.  A slippery and engaging book of great beauty 
and resonance.--jmb

Sarya Elizabeth Gratner, ed.: EARTHWORDS (anthology)--Write For 
Life, 4773 Harmony Lane, Orcutt CA, 93455-4513.  103 pp., $10.00.  
An exquisitely hand-crafted book-object with a front-cover 
reproduction of a full-color representational painting by Shirley 
Wallace whose sunlight, leaf-shadows and window-reflections 
epitomize the mostly quite conventional but often lyrically-
substantial poems within.  I was especially taken with Camina 
Tripodi's daringly simple "Because Of Your Heart," which consists 
of just four lines: its title repeated three times followed by 
"Everything."--bg

Richard F. Hayes Sr.: THAT'S LIFE--American Living Press, PO Box 
901, Allston MA, 02134.  40 pp., $3.00.  The poet is an ex-fire 
chief, and a WWII veteran.  His poems are tantalizing personal 
glimpses of a full life, a life of double-edged humor and pathos.  
His work is clean and clever, graceful and dramatic, one man's 
thoughtful account of life, no more, no less.  I found this set 
somewhat academic in that it never tries to break out of its 
placid mold.  Like poetry of another era.  The excitement when it 
comes is in the paradox hidden under the simplicity.  ÒYes, she 
did swing by her/ teeth from the rope attached to a tree limb, 
but only momentarily..."  The simplicity in this case is not 
boring, but relaxing and charming.--rrle

Bernard Hewit: TACIT TENDRILS--Wild Strawberry Press, 105 Betty 
Rd., East Meadow NY, 11554.  20 pp., $2.00.  Obscure twists in 
voice and mood within these poems.  For example, when he talks 
about returning home after the war, "he needed silence and space/ 
in order to once more paradoxically/ join the human race."  
Metrically moody and forced.  Included in this chap is what he 
calls a "Gothic Play."  Eight pages and five characters to be 
exact.  It shows the irony of human behaviors, and interactions, 
but it is hardly Gothic, though it is playful.  Poetry sometimes 
portentous & rhetorical, sometimes rhyming, always shadowed by 
implication.--rrle

Dick Higgins: POEMS PLAIN AND FANCY--Station Hill, Barrytown NY, 
12507.  Selected shorter poems 1957-1985 that document a career 
of experimental poetry by one of its foremost exponents.  Many 
many many many different approaches to writing here, mostly under 
the imposition of various structures (and strictures), including 
chance, repetition, sound translation, and his own snowflake 
form.  While not every example will impact the reader deeply, 
there are quite a few genuinely moving works here, and even the 
poems that don't work emotionally show the reader new forms to 
look into for the reader's own writing.  I think anyone involved 
or interested in experimental poetry should at least thumb 
through this book once to get an idea of the many things Higgins 
has been up to.--ar

Jack Hirschman: THE XIBALBA ARCANE--Azul Editions, 2032 Belmont 
Rd., NW, Suite 301, Washington DC, 20009.  62 pp., $10.95.  
Drawing on the Mayan books of prophecies, the Chilam Balam, 
Hirschman reprises much of the lyric density of his earlier poems 
based in Surrealism and Judaic tradition, and expands it into the 
revolutionary commitment of his more recent work.  Here 
everything goes back to roots, including revolutions: dialectics 
that turn in circles according to the oldest calendars of the 
western world and appear in the Zappatista Revolt of contemporary 
Chiapas.  Like any book of prophecies, this one reaches into the 
past and the future to understand what is happening now.  In 
Hirsch's view this is a time for anger and hence for redress; a 
time for hope since it is a time for action.--ky 

Tom House: I MUST BE AN ALIEN--Penny Dreadful Press, 6680 
Charlotte Ave., H-6, Nashville TN, 37209.  16 pp., $1.00.  Poetry 
caught somewhere in the lost triangle between surreal, beat, and 
jazz.  Exaggerated line breaks and mounting cadences produce 
rousing images of tent revivals, pornography, horny little 
sisters, cannibalism, and drinking at the local union hall.  This 
chapbook is a fun-house mirror which twists images to frightening 
degrees.  Interesting and vivid.--rrle

Geof Huth: TO A SMALL STREAM OF WATER (OR DITCH)--Standing Stones 
Press, 7 Circle Pines, Morris MN, 56267.  15 pp.  A meditation on 
consciousness and its consequences--Huth plunges into the depths 
of a rage for order that positions death at the very edges of the 
neat, prosodic alignments of meaning that language grapples with.  
Huth's work is a wonderful exploration of how a writer expresses 
self-reflexivity in words, particularly in the intriguing 
"Arrange," "At," and "Zipper," in which a child's struggle with a 
zipper parallels the nature of language pushed into new 
configurations.--ssn

David Ignatow: GLEANINGS: UNCOLLECTED POETRY OF THE FIFTIES--
Grist, Columbus Circle Station, PO Box 20805, New York NY, 10032-
1496.  $25.00.  Book on computer disk, available in Windows and 
Mac format--in either version, the book is not in plain ascii 
format.  It comes with a viewer that facilitates movement through 
the book, the placement of bookmarks, etc.  Format is modeled on 
that of a printed book, with sturdy, legible type, and "pages"--
units framed as pages in a book would be.  
     Perhaps it's appropriate that this harbinger of book forms 
of the future should be a retrospective of work by a senior poet.  
In his preface to this collection, Ignatow says that these poems 
"were not given their final version in time for publication in 
POEMS: 1934-1969."  Some still seem unfinished, but this 
collection does includes some of Ignatow's best work of the time.  
Perhaps it was wise of him to let them cook longer.  Generally, 
these are poems typical of Ignatow during the '50s and any fan of 
his should appreciate them.  The urban industrial milieu, with 
its drabness, repression, anger, fits of bravado and long 
stretches of quiet desperation, may have changed in many of its 
outward details but a lot of the essentials remain as relevant 
today as they were in the '50s--perhaps, eerily, more so now than 
10 or 20 years ago.--ky

Michael Kriesel: ASSHOLE MANIFESTO--Full Moon Press, 727 Lincoln 
#1, Antigo WI, 54409.  4 pp.,  $1.00(?).  This is a short chap 
that feels like a takeoff on Ginsberg's HOWL. Not exactly an 
original idea, and the anger becomes more obnoxious than a 
threat, but it still works in part.  This is actually an excerpt 
of a longer poem (oh no!), and I don't know, with UFO abductions, 
AIDS, dildos, MTV, and the philosophy that life is shit stated 
over and over again, this becomes rather tedious fast.  The few 
lines that work aren't enough to save this excerpt, much less a 
longer piece.--o

Jack Lamb, editor: SPEAKING OF CHANGE--PO Box 4290, Carlsbad CA, 
92018.  69 pp., $4.00.  An anthology of racially-conscious prose 
& poetry of Color.  Originally a spoken word performance of 
persuasive face-to-face discourse.  Here we have racial and 
cultural disintegration: "the Taiwanese is in me I just don't 
know how to bring it out," Leng Loh explains her lack of 
traditional language.  We hear a southern child's wonder "The 
year my mother birthed me/ they shot Jack/ and as a child, I 
accepted the guilt of that."  Infinity decays in the face of 
these disturbing voices, voices of people devastated by gilded 
white ideals: keening holocaustical voices weary from pain and 
deceit "this is my culture.  i experience it differently from 
you.  it is not a joking matter to me."  Read this, learn from 
this.--rrle

Dan Landrum: SIDE-LONG GLANCE--c/o Taggerzine Specials, PO Box 
632952, San Diego CA, 92163.  8 pp., $1.00(?).  This collection 
captures a poem, "Impersonals," that comes so damn close to the 
truth I want to know what Landrum was drinking when he wrote it.  
It's a cross-reference guide to misfits looking for love, while 
running through a list of things that'll alienate the most 
empathetic savior on a street corner.  These poems click with 
understanding, and although this chap is short, it carries more 
wisdom than anything anyone who claimed God was talking through 
his lips ever had to say.--o

Hank Lazer: INTER(IR)RUPTIONS--Generator Press, 8139 Midland Rd., 
Mentor  OH, 44060.  $4.00.  The first chapter in a long work-in-
progress, 10 x 10, INTER(IR)RUPTIONS is fundamentally a poem, or 
series of poems, of parallel intelligences drawn from a variety 
of sources including Emerson's journals, The New York Times, 
Seventeen, a work on neuroscience, etc., and Lazer's own 
powerful, sometimes even ludic, imagination.  It is how this 
imagination creatively juxtaposes and allows the texts and 
graphics to locate poetically with one another that gives the 
work shape in the mind as well as on the page.  We sense 
initially the similarity of this collision of voices with our 
daily lives.  Despite whatever course we may choose to focus on 
as if it were the subject of our concentration, in reality we are 
living through and working with a multitude of media and 
intelligences that in essence provide the primary substance of 
that focus.  We are then living many lives occupying several 
domains at the same time in a single space.  Lazer articulates 
this reality with a music that not only reminds us of these 
anxious circumstances but finds the music in it--a kind of flux 
that neither annihilates the individual persona nor panders to 
it.  This is a realistic poetry for an age where information 
media, and this also reflects on the function of the book itself 
and print media generally, is the actual "landscape" of our 
passage.  
     INTER(IR)RUPTIONS then is a mapping process, but not of the 
actual, but a means of responding to the actual.  This is the 
dance of "events"  entered with a metasentience of the nature of 
the music.  Almost apocalyptic in its effect, the knowledge of 
nature extended into the abstract thus rendering the abstract as 
natural.  Still, this is only one possible overview, and the 
beauty of the Lazer's poetry should be witnessed line by line for 
the deeper secrets it yields.  High craft in combination with 
vast imagination.  The opening movement of a important work.--jb

Richard L. Levesque: FETAL GRACELAND--Wudge Press, 2227 Woodglen 
Dr., Indianapolis IN, 46260.  32 pp., $3.00.  With poems titled 
"Orga(z)m," "Prison Stabbing Blues," and "Punk Rock Cunt," we 
expect an ominous point of view, but Levesque goes beyond simple 
sinister: here are the killing grounds filled with monstrous 
images of zombies, two-dollar booze, guns, serial killers, death 
and bizarre sex.  "Can you hear the killer/ inside me--?"  Amid 
the bleak images is a stinging force, something that reads like 
an incantation--"moans, forest molds, salt/ and cider; pagan 
folds."--or sometimes like a syncopated beatstomp: "knee drop 
baby worships this,/ this Cadillac lump without a soul."  
Sociopathic poetry of fractured hopes and unique times.  I'm 
thinking about cutting and pasting this chap into my family 
album.--rrle

Rafael Zepeda & Gerald Locklin: THE DURANGO P0EMS--Zerx Press, 
5016 Inspiration Dr. SE, Albuquerque NM, 87108.  30 pp., $3.00.  
I like collaborations like this, wars between poets that can only 
leave ashes and flames and explosions that kill more neighbors 
than friends.  We got drinking, self medication, attempted sexual 
endeavors, fights that don't want to happen unless someone wants 
to throw the first punch, ethnic points of view, and a real 
attempt to capture what it all means on paper, knowing damn well 
once you sober up you'll probably throw the answer away. Usually 
you get sparring between poets in these deals, but here you got 
best friends throwing imaginary punches, both figuring they won 
the fight, leaving the reader laughing at that cocky walk both 
writers got when they walk down the street.  These are old hands 
doing it right, and every word does what its supposed to do.--o

Liz Magor and Joey Morgan: HOW TO AVOID THE FUTURE TENSE--The 
Walter Phillips Gallery, Box 1020, Banff AL, CANADA, T0L 0C0.  
$20 (Canadian), + shipping.  Basically a photo book with 
narrative.  But some of the photos are from a different narrative 
than the text.  There are two kinds of pages, one for each 
narrative.  On white pages there are pictures of people camping, 
in relatively primitive style, in backwoods Canada somewhere.  On 
translucent pages, there are anecdotes from the narrator's stay 
in France plus small pictures of bits of French architecture and 
art.  Thus we have juxtaposed Old World and New World ways of 
living in the past.  The reader is left to make the final 
comparisons of the two.--ar

Stephen-Paul Martin: CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION--Standing Stones 
Press, 7 Circle Pines, Morris MN, 56267.  15 pp.  Two pieces, 
poetic in their intensity and their attention to the multi-
faceted possibilities of language.  "Double Bed" is a dramatic 
monologue recast to accommodate two points of views: Jenny and 
Freddie.  There is an eerie doubling going on: Jenny and Freddie 
could be aspects of one person, split into painful doppelganger, 
evil twin status, by the sheer stress of maintaining a pulse rate 
while all around collapse.--ssn

G.Z. Mataisz: END TIME--AK Press, PO Box 40682, San Francisco CA, 
94140-0682.  299 pp., $8.00.  Solidly-crafted thriller set in the 
year 2007 and concerned with some missing "riemanim: (a sort of 
super-plutonium), with lots of anti-war echoes from the sixties.  
Provocative political discussion and "what if's" raise the book's 
intellectual value without spoiling it as a good read.--bg

Michael McClure: LIGHTING THE CORNERS On Art, Nature, and the 
Visionary--University of New Mexico College of Arts and Sciences.  
338 pp., $19.95.  "Our sensoriums are spirit mechanisms that 
light up the cave around them for the experience," McClure states 
in the opening interview, "Writing One's Body", of this essential 
and revealing volume.  He has been a traveler through our common 
space-time, our great mammal voice bard, reminding us, as we 
create ever more indulgent idols to our techno-arrogance, that we 
are animals, our mind, our soul is animal soul and to attempt to 
deny that is a kind of self-imposed schizophrenia.  In these 
essays and interviews we begin to understand the poetics behind 
the poems, or rather the poetics articulated in prose what the 
poems allow us to live.  And we see McClure as he moves among his 
peers, pieces on Robert Duncan, Robert Creely, Allen Ginsberg, 
Jim Morrison, Dennis Hopper, Bob Dylan, Gary Snyder, Julian Beck, 
etc., and come to realize the connections, the obvious influence 
his work and his life (the two are surely one) have had on the 
culture.  The pieces cover four decades of radical intelligence, 
as fresh and important today as they have ever been.  Through 
these essays and interviews we get illuminations of the poet 
building his soul in the world, and revelations within our own 
sensoriums as to what we are and how we might act from that 
knowledge.  If McClure had never written a poem this book would 
be indispensable, but because he voiced and scribed so much 
brilliant poetry this book means more than the textual form can 
relate.  "To walk a hundred yards in total freedom is to live 
forever in eternity--freedom for an instant is beyond measure and 
is immortality."  This is truth in and as flesh, an invitation 
impossible to refuse.--jb

Steven McDaris: THE MOON GETS LAID--Skinners Irregular Horse, 
2107 E. Jarvis St., Milwaukee WI, 53211.  $4.00.  McDaris was a 
new name to me a few months ago.  His chapbooks have been 
arriving in the mail and I've been knocked-out by this flat-out 
great story writer.  Real page turners.  A new raw talent forming 
and taking shape.  Hope he sticks with his big-hearted vision. 
His locker room banter of tits & girls.  His easy shock of 
recognition with the feelings absolutely familiar.  His tact and 
sagacity and magic of getting them down on paper in such a way 
the picture blossoms in your mind like a John Ford movie.  Never 
dull.  Always moving.  If he were a bebop saxophonist in the '50s 
he'd be Dexter Gordon, going with the flow.  Not the innovator 
that Bird or Sonny Stitt or Lucky Thompson were.  Just good ol' 
straight-forward Dexter (who incidentally made his most powerful 
statements in the '70s).  This MOON is a real '60s story, with 
all the pertinent images of that era--weed, free love, & wine 
high psychedelic philosophy.  It strikes me as a man's story--I 
wonder if women enjoy reading it.  MOON is a novella set in the 
Rocky Mountains of New Mexico, with an admirable knowledge of 
flora & fauna & geology & native cooking & Indian history & 
customs.  Seamlessly interwoven.  Characters as alive as 
yesterday.--mw

Todd Moore: DANCING W/ BLOOD--Undulating Bedsheet Productions, 
c/o Mike, PO Box 25760, Los Angeles CA, 90025.  16 pp., $1.50.  
Todd Moore is that uncle your best friend had, that was so 
worldly and wise and filled with tales of weirdness, you wanted 
to leave home and see it all for yourself.  In this collection 
you get the hard edged unforgiving poetry that Moore does so 
well, with poems about a "bar girl coming out for/ a smoke she 
has a 4 inch/ pipe rolled into her fist" bashing the head of a 
drunk trying to molest a girl with a 45 automatic, and the first 
safe sex attack I've ever seen: "when he/ wdn't give her/ the 
grocery/ money she/ sapped him/ w/a 2 ply/ condom filled/ 
w/nickels...".  There are other great poems done in that 
tradition Todd has become famous for, capturing revenge with a 
taste of blood.--o

Todd Moore: SHOOTING OUT THE LIGHTS--Zerx Press, 5016 Inspiration 
Dr. SE, Albuquerque NM, 87108.  40 pp., $4.00.  (back-to -back 
with Mark Weber's SWINDLER'S HARMONICA SIESTA).  It's good to see 
Todd settling into the southwest after all of that vicious 
gangster writing of the midwest.  Fortunately he's as mean as 
ever, and the poems in this collection capture hookers, sweat and 
piss soaked beds in ten minute hotels, home made 22s, bets that 
got more losers than winners, brains scattered across a hundred 
sidewalks, and rocks smashing through windows without a message 
you don't want to hear.  This is Moore kicking ass.  This is the 
real life without pretense.  
     And hey, just when you thought you were safe from Weber he 
kicks back with a strong longing for stability in a world that 
changes its faces so fast you often want it all to sit still so 
you can know where you are at that moment.  Mark also grabs that 
asshole who fucks with you at a reading and shows the jerk the 
rules are a lot different than he thought.  When I read Weber I 
feel like I'm drinking with an old friend, we're catching up on 
the latest news.--o

Susan Smith Nash: MY LOVE IS APOCALYPSE AND RHINESTONES--Texture 
Press, 3760 Cedar Ridge Dr., Norman OK, 73072.  24 pp., $4.00.  
Using Marilyn Monroe as an archetype for women in a media-
saturated society, Susan Smith Nash creates a chapbook of poems 
mingling levels of allusion, cross-pollinating from line to line 
as worlds collide in jarring verbal effects.  "Celebrity goes by 
the velocity of discover, I waited/ my sense of self scattered by 
Doppler-shifted/ light palms clapped together, so faint so 
retreating."  The best poem here is the extended "Letters from 
Marilyn," written in a more conventional verse but with enormous 
power.  The first letter ends with the line: "Let me rip apart 
the reverse image of my smile."  The eighth letter ends with "His 
mistake broke me, like echoes of mother/ on the face of every 
abandoned child."  Nash concludes with an essay on Monroe's last 
movie, "The Misfits," in which the actress played an androgynous 
character, and which Nash sees as a cinematic commentary on 
gender roles.--tw

Susan Smith Nash: T.E. LAWRENCE: A VEIL IN THE SAND--Room Press, 
29 Lynton Place, White Plains NY, 10606.  14 pp., $3.00?.  A set 
of five remarkably passionate long poems, which invoke not only 
distant times, places, and personalities, but a very strong sense 
of self coming into being, as if the awareness of history (and 
not just human, but geological as well), were "taken personally" 
very much indeed.  The language is largely accessible yet 
charged, elliptical, and constantly breaking out ahead of its own 
structures, running ahead of itself:

     Serpentine walls fits like saddle, series erect
     desert grow in weeping torrents, false poetics like abandon
     or warmth, bent twisted, round, ripping silence
     cold spokes on rhythmic way you tell tide hitting seawall,
     Type faster, harder, even--arrange sentiment onto self
     or message--intelligence on the basic wet & dry
     season, abundant dazzle mystery Alchemist constructed
     hero at work Brughel's prelude to chemistry, whipping camels 
    foaming to your Yanbu home, Saudi Arabian
    grief or rape sprawls human remains over dawn's corona--

It is rare to encounter poetry of such emotional intensity and 
strong intellectual engagement combined.  The closest thing to it 
I can think of are some of the major works of Romanticism (i.e., 
the Odes of Keats, or Jose Maria Heedria's Niagra) although 
comparison is a challenging one, and is an indication of the 
authentic brilliance of her work here.--jmb

Letta Simone-Nefertari Neely: GAWD AND ALLUH HUH SISTAHS--104 
Gates Ave., Brooklyn NY, 11238.  28 pp., $?.  Starting with a 
quote from M.O.V.E. leader, Ramona Africa, "Nobody was supposed 
to survive," Neely goes on to prove that many people have indeed 
survived.  Written in a diced phonic style of free verse, with 
liberal doses of Black English, a powerful narrative and 
historical Black images.  "my girls are blk shadows lookin for 
answer hanging/ from a pulpit blown away/ by the klan...// ...let 
us all say ache."  Letta Neely has the yoke of tradition upon 
her, but she projects a visionary future, a future where we 
"remember to take Emmit Teal, Atlanta child murders, ghost 
dancers, Stonewall, and/ apple  pie/ all together."  She shows us 
the bold vicious hate within our culture, with all of its isms 
and phobias (racism, sexism, homophobia), and then she stands up 
and says what she believes with a passionate voice echoing into a 
new era.  "this/ is/ no/ time to stop breathing/ this is no time 
to stop/ this is no time."  Feminist, lesbian black pride in its 
most critical, intellectual form--the poem of incidental tragedy 
and healing growth.--rrle

R.L. Nichols: THE POINT IS...--Alpha Beat Press, 31a Waterloo 
St., New Hope PA, 18938.  $6.00.  With major honesty, wide open, 
speaking with the machine shop music tools of poetry, R.L. 
Nichols sings through this book with some of the cleanest and 
clearest agony and sexual pleasure notes of word music of any 
poet canary or spring bird on the planet.  Can do and does make 
amazement with the simple language words into poetry.  No dull, 
camp repetition.  A voice of communication.  Frank philosophy 
from the bottom honest side up.  Beat, Bukowski, bad, bay, mouth 
full words dance.  And he says, and we should all consider when 
thinking about poetry: "To realize the beauty of worms?"--mb

Eric Nisenson: ASCENSION--JOHN COLTRANE AND HIS QUEST--St.  
Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York NY, 10010.  $22.95.  
For many of us John Coltrane was more than a jazz genius, though 
that surely would have been enough to merit his acclaim.  He 
moved through all jazz had to offer and all he could invoke from 
those roots and went further still beyond the limits of his 
medium, his instrument and possibly even his humanity and carried 
us along with him (even those of us who discovered him a decade 
or more after his death).  To tell his story as a man or musician 
would and has produced fine work, there is so much to draw from.  
But Nisenson has given us a gift of another order, focusing 
centrally on what drove him to the reaches of such extraordinary 
passion.  Certainly this is a biography, covering virtually all 
stages of his life including such bucolic details as his love for 
sweet potato pie (which gave him dental problems) and his humble 
southern manner or his early drug abuse.  But as Nisenson says in 
the opening pages, Coltrane's "life was based on a series of 
discoveries".  It is these moments of discovery and self-
revelation that  are the meat of the book and what gives 
Coltrane's life and work such enormous value for the generations.  
The music and how it relates to the quest is central, including 
details of how Trane arrived at his "sheets of sound" or his 
later development of modes and finally free outside playing.  
Yet, the descriptions are never difficult and non-musicians and 
players alike should be able to fully understand every nuance.  
Also, Nisenson's personal accounts of Coltrane in performance, 
which often included solos that would last over an hour, add an 
almost cinematic dimension to the book.  After listening to him 
all these years I found these passages to be a dear treat, able 
to see through them what I will never be able to see in the 
flesh.  The individual albums are analyzed and appraised as well 
so that someone who knew little of the work would have a reliable 
guide of which pieces to seek out first.  Nisenson's research 
should also be commended, full of accounts and information from 
friends and acquaintances and of course the musicians themselves.  
I've wanted for years to read what I felt was an adequate account 
of a man, and the music, for which words must surely fall short, 
and this is as close as we are ever likely to get.  Coltrane has 
inspired us to commit ourselves whole heart and soul to our 
callings and is no doubt a primary inspiration for much of what 
is reviewed in these pages.  It is such a delight at last to have 
a volume that explores and relates the discoveries in the life of 
the high lord of jazz transcendence.  Very highly 
recommended.--jb

Oberc: PORN--A.T.H. Press., c/o T. Bishop, 2177 Stewart Dr., 
Hatfield PA, 19440.  40 pp., $3.00.  The violent and decadent 
times of a female porno star as she lives and works the fringe of 
society, from childhood to middle-age.  Hypnotic, erotic, 
violent, just like real life.  Paragraphs form a prose-poem style 
which reads like parables of the obscene.  Oberc has fused a 
singular isolated spirit of seeking with a delicious sexually 
obsessed darkness.  "feminists scream outside the set/ they want 
to save my ass/ they don't want to pay my bills/ I fuck for a 
living/ they scream out slogans/ they tell me to save myself/ 
they talk about freedom while trying to take it all away..."  
Oberc's self-lacerating personification judges and refuses to 
judge, condones and condemns society at the same time.  This chap 
is not for everybody, but I enjoyed it.--rrle

William Parker: MUSIC IS--Open Magazine New Series, PO Box 2726, 
Westfield NJ, 07091.  $1.00.  Introduction to the forthcoming 
book, MUSIC AND THE SHADOWPEOPLES, MUSIC IS is a spontaneous 
feeling manifesto, a diatribe of holy inspiration from one who 
understands the deepest richest impulses of creative sound 
without the restrictions of manufactured order.  "Music is the 
abysmal rainbow that bridges endless galaxies/ Music passes 
through the musician, the Muse-Physician knows enough not to 
interfere/ Music remands bad spirits."  We get the sense of the 
full liberating possibility of music.  Music as the rite soul 
healing.  This little book, like Parker's music, is further 
evidence of his enormous gift for delivering that rite.  Much 
gratitude to the folks at Open for this and all recent materials, 
they continue to remind us of the power of walking the radical 
edge.--jb 

Geza Perneczky: THE MAGAZINE NETWORK-The Trends of Alternative 
Art in the Light of Their Periodicals-1968-1988--c/o Stephen 
Perkins, 1816 S. College,  Iowa City IA, 52245.  285 pp., $30.00.  
Mike Gunderloy thought he was onto the big time when he started 
Factsheet Five, but there were already extensive archives and 
documenters of the underground, and if you want to see what laid 
the foundation for Mike's publication, this is the place to 
start.  Perneczky originally published this book in Hungarian, 
and it had an international focus on mail art and literary 
publications from the very start.  At the same time many of the 
underground publications that earned decent reputations in the US 
during the '80s (Nightmares of Reason, Artpolice, Bag of Wire, 
Bikini Girl, Lost And Found Times, etc.) are captured at their 
peak, and were probably discovered through Factsheet Five's 
attempts to catch as mush of that world as possible.  Although 
there is an academic side to this great book, there is also a 
historical capturing of many of the individuals who were doing it 
yourself before anyone knew what doing it yourself was all about.  
They were highly motivated creative types that got involved 
because they were so driven, because they had to focus their 
energy in a positive direction, and this book captures that 
energy and creativity in an international perspective you won't 
find in your local underground coffee table book.  If you can't 
afford a copy, try to get your Library to borrow it for you.  
It's definitely a peek into the past that'll stir brain cells you 
thought were dead.--o

Stephen Petroff: THE SECRETS OF THE TOWN OF BOWDOINHAM--Kore 
Press.  24 pp.  Handwritten in legible script with exquisite 
hand-drawn borders and artwork.  I believe it is written about a 
small rural town in Maine.  Deep woods magic, and pain combine to 
swirl around the reader like a vortex of strange assurances that 
something weirder is coming up.  As narrative prose it has a rich 
feel: a mentally deficient boy teaches his father the magic of 
wooden whistles; a cancer patient becomes a ghost; a woman 
shoplifts plums, a poet's last meal, a witch who lives on Post 
Road, and the destruction of a litter of halfgrown puppies... 
these incidents and more are found in these pages.--rrle

Sylvia Play: AIRY EL--Poets & Writers, dist. by Da Dead Press, 
3226 Raspberry, Erie PA, 16508.  $$23.95.  This appears to be a 
major find: 22 lost poems by Plath, edited by Paul Weinman and 
Ron Androla.  These poems were obviously buried by the author, 
perhaps out of embarrassment at their sexual explicitness (some 
titles: "Plath, the Hopeless Cunt", "Pigs in Fecus"), but they 
will go a long way toward clarifying some of the issues that have 
swirled around her work.  The editors are to be congratulated for 
this latest example of their on-going scholarship and research 
into the hidden and ignored texts for some of our greatest 
literary heroes.  (I only wish they had kept their noses out of 
my trash--last year they published a group of poems I had thrown 
away and forgotten, but they must have found them doubtless 
soaked in the juices from one of those chicken-package diapers, 
and published them as EAR CANNIBAL, to my great embarrassment.  
Oh well, one has to be thick-skinned in this poetry business, and 
I suppose the interests of history take precedence over the 
posturings of my fragile ego.--jmb
     Don't worry about the address or the price because anytime 
Androla an with Robert Lowell ("Shy girl anemic in back of his 
poetry class,"), and yeah, more lust ("Did you shed/ Silk socks, 
capped incisors and a BMW").  Sometimes these psychopaths hit it 
right on the nose, but other times they're just making references 
to the authors while being themselves, creating a satire that 
leaves you trying not to laugh, but knowing your eyeballs might 
fall out of their sockets if you don't.--oed incisors and a

Richard Schevill: WHERE TO GO, WHAT TO DO, WHEN YOU ARE BERN 
PORTER and Bern Porter: SOUNDS THAT AROUSE ME: Selected Writings-
-Tilbury House, 132 Water Street, Gardiner ME, 04345.  $16.95 and 
$9.95 respectively.  Reading these books gave me a picture of and 
an appreciation for Bern Porter.  The books of his I had seen 
before, small volumes of founds, had not overly impressed me.  
Porter was a failure in that he did not generate the income to live off his work, but was a great success in anticipating ideas 
(both artistic and intellectual) that would rise in importance a 
decade or five later.  It's important to know about Bern Porter 
because he looked towards the future, because he survived so long 
without compromising his aims, and because of the way he 
celebrated creativity in all areas of his life.  Porter is an 
inspiring example.  On the other hand, the books make it clear 
there were obstacles--primarily poverty, misdirected social 
expectations, and governmental mistrust--to getting things done.  
In spite of all this, Porter did a lot.  The moral is, if you 
can't do it, find another way to do it; if you can't find a way 
to do it, at least sketch your vision down.
     Schevill's biography is a chronology of where Porter went 
and what he did.  The book is profusely illustrated with many 
relevant pictures of Porter, of his artworks, of his found poems, 
of newspaper clippings, of places he visited, covers and ads for 
books he published, etc.  A number of poems and other writings 
are included in the text.  After cataloging and describing a long 
list of Porter's achievements, the author devotes the last 
chapter to giving a detailed appreciation of Porter's found poems 
and what they stand for.  That chapter makes me want to look at 
some of those books in the major sequence of founds books, and 
look back at those I'd already gotten (such as the two short 
books published by the Runaway Spoon Press).
     SOUNDS THAT AROUSE ME includes all kinds of writing, 
excepting the visual: finished poems, parts of books, 
manifestoes, excerpts of interviews, even a couple letters.  
The writing ranges from the familiar (I had the same basic idea 
for "Blank Verse" around the same time, and I'm sure there were 
hundreds if not thousands of other schoolboys that had the same 
idea as a reaction to being taught Shakespeare in the dry dusty 
ways high school teachers think up) to the incompletely thought 
out (such as "Statement"--fixing or replacing the book/text as 
transmitter of information would require many years of effort--
this piece gives a few concrete proposals that don't seem to be 
incomplete answers to the very important facts given.) to the 
moving and complete and significant ("Why Don't You Use the 
Trail?", "Sciart Manifesto", "Me").  The reminiscences on people 
like Henry Miller, Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and 
Gertrude Stein are quite interesting, too. 
     The biggest shortcoming in this anthology, ultimately, may 
be the neglect of the found poems, of which we have but one or 
two examples (if you count the rather arresting "Found Story").  
I can also complain that the resetting of "What Henry Miller Said 
and Why It Is Important" leaves out the all-important white space 
in the original.  But Porter's been at it for longer than most of 
us have been living, and despite the flaws, these books are 
important documents of living history.--ar

Peter Redgrove: THE LABORATORS--Taxus Press.  £6.50.  This 
collection of Peter Redgrove's delicately fashioned verse 
displays the same concern common to much of his poetry: the 
female menstrual cycle and its overwhelming importance to human 
society.  Redgrove, a trained chemist, sprinkles his poems with 
an eclectic mix of scientific and alchemical terms and often 
writes of a surrealistic or mystical blending of the inner and 
outer realms.  "The scents and the steams, distilled, condense on 
the mirrors/ In populations of pearly droplets;// Equally the 
whole forest outside the window/ Shimmers with dew;// Equally her 
mouth today/ Shimmers with his seed."--tw

Jeff Rentsch: THE STORY OF TWO MEN--PO Box 480, Denville NJ, 
07834.  24 pp., $2.00(?).  This is a collage of text and visuals 
that may, or may not, be related, and which gestalt into a 
strange coherency about a son who beat his father with a bat 
until he couldn't beat him anymore. At first I was hesitant to 
even deal with this, but after looking at it closely, I was 
amazed at how powerful it really was, and the way it strangely 
fit together, like a three dimensional puzzle that doesn't make 
any sense until it's all assembled.  Rentsch is someone to look 
out for, especially if he's creeping up behind you.--o

Marilyn R. Rosenberg: SPALL SPIRULA--101 Lakeview Ave. West, 
Peekskill NY, 10566.  37 pp., $12.00.  Another quietly important 
visio-verbal work by one of this country's quiet handful of long-
time important visual poets.  It consists of competently 
representational pen & inks of the artist's study, rocking chair, 
scissors, unpacked groceries, etc., mixed with discussions of 
illumagery using quotations from people like Walter Benjamin, and 
wherever  "9: Potato chips sell eight times as well as pretzels" 
came from, not to mention non-representational explosions, one 
with eye-charts and words derived from "fan-" such as "fantasy" 
and "fancier."  My favorite verbal touch is an alphabet that's 
spelled "ba, dc," etc., up to "ts"--meaning the alphabet ended 
with TS Eliot??  Every page has several such items.  This is 
definitely a must-get book for anyone interested in 
pluraesthetic, or even just visual, art.--bg

Stuart Ross: RUNTS--Proper Tales Press, Box 789, Station F, 
Toronto Ontario, Canada, M4Y 2N7.  $1.00.  A collection of 20 
poems, each of 6 lines or less, that have an ironic, playful 
quality that is most refreshing.  Using a pared-down but direct 
language, they often create a sense of the possibilities that lie 
behind ordinary surfaces:

          WHO KNOWS?

     She sits on the subway
     eating Zesty Cheese Doritos
     and reading The Enquirer.
     Maybe she killed someone today.

C.C. Russell: MORE LIKE FORKS--UBP, c/o Mike, PO Box 25760, Los 
Angeles CA, 90025.  24 pp., $2.00.  I like the way Russell turns 
a line: "You said we used to spoon/ all night,/ wrapped around 
each other", "I know something about windows/ and saying the 
right words/ at the wrong times", "They would not call this love/ 
but warfare", are just a sampling of openings that make you know 
something is going to come smashing through your window any 
second.  These are poems filled with confused emotions, 
contrasting love and hate. But there is also, in the midst of the 
confusion, a strange hope that keeps you going, that makes you 
want to get it right the next time around.--o

Vern Rautsala: LITTLE-KNOWN SPORTS--Univ. of Mass. Press.  
$20.00 cloth, $9.95 paper.  Winner of the annual Juniper Prize 
in poetry, Vern Rutsala's LITTLE-KNOWN SPORTS is a collection of 
prose poems divided into three parts.  The first part contains 
poems about photographs, each one describing a particular scene 
and somehow transforming it into a distinctive and 
psychologically-resonant slice-of-life.  The second part, 
entitled "Bestiary," contains mythologized explanations of 
everyday objects, as in "Paper Clip": "We persist in baiting this 
dull hook with page after page, yet we catch nothing."  The final 
part contains the little-known sports of the book's title, 
including sleeping, hating, getting into bed, and being hopeless.  
All in all, a whimsical and unpretentious examination of this odd 
experience called life.--tw

Gregory Vincent St. Thomasino: WHO IS BIANCA?--Wet Motorcycle 
Press, 3055 Decatur Ave. Apt. 2D, Bronx NY, 10467.  6 pp., 
$1.00?.  A torrent of Othello-like obsessions about an apparent 
rival in love whose name is Bianca.  Exactly where we are, or 
what's happened is unclear, but that is appropriate--as are the 
florally-archaic poeticisms, and the hints of romantic-novel-
schlock, for the poem is (brilliantly) about a person too 
deranged by jealousy to care about journalistic thoroughness, 
decorum, or avoiding gush.--bg

Gregory Vincent St. Thomasino: SIX COMETS ARE COMING; ELEGY FOR 
CHRISTOPHER SMART; and WHO IS BIANCA?--Wet Motorcycle Press, 3055 
Decatur Ave. Apt. 2D, Bronx NY, 10467.  6 pp. @, $1.00@?.  These 
three small booklets form a set, each presenting a different 
strategy for manipulating texts: the first epigrammatically 
and/or visually; the second by excising words and letters from 
words to create a sense of intriguing fragmentariness; and the third by suggesting 17th century poetic diction in an enigmatic 
dialogic context.  Very nice indeed; like little primers of 
linguistic possibility.--jmb

Jack Saunders: OLLA-PODRIDA--Florida's Shame, PO Box 10375, 
Parker FL, 32404.  4 pp., SASE.  Soon, boasts Saunders, he'll 
have written "100 books without selling a word to New York or 
Hollywood."  But he keeps on keepin' on, obsessively re-prosing 
his defeats at the hands of the literary establishment, now in 
this series of 4-page pamphlets available to whoever shows an 
interest.  One reviews BLASTER by Al Ackerman, who (now that 
Bukowski's gone) is the writer to beat for Saunders.  Another 
reports on and satirizes the Florida poetry-grants scene--which 
leads to a third, which is a quite intelligent discussion of the 
flaws in most fellowship-distribution procedures.  Whether 
Sisyphus, or the new Kerouac he sees himself as, Saunders is 
worth reading.--bg

Barry Silesky: ONE THING THAT CAN SAVE US--Coffee House Press.  
$10.95.  Filled with talk of lost jobs, unpaid bills, lives 
distracted by shopping and television, and worries about the 
state of the world, Barry Silesky's short-short stories paint a 
bleak picture of Clinton's America.  These stories are 
constructed a sentence at a time, each simple declarative 
sentence not building on the one before but going in a new 
direction, adding fresh perspective, new data, until the effect 
is almost giddy as we hang on tight to the words so we don't fall 
off.  Maybe the words are the one thing that can save us.--tw

Jack Skelley: NO BARBIE--Found Street, 2260 S. Ferdinand Ave., 
Monteray Park CA, 91754.  $1.00.  Two poems out of the Bukowski 
school but with weirdly misconnected images like an "Onramp crack 
beggar" vs. "Nietzsche's hanky holder" vs. "Blue chip stamp 
collector" in one series of lines, and a post-modernist allusion 
to Capt. Kirk preceding "Mahler turned all the way up/ to sheer 
black, with a red rose felt at the tip."--bg
     Two delightfully quirky poems presented as a small folded 
broadside where the concept of "Barbie" is presented as a 
metaphor for a kind of swarming erotic irritant:

     My doggie
     Seventh planet of space
     Mohammed's Ecstasy
     All the things you aren't
     Little animal
     Polio moss in the gutter

Patti Smith: EARLY WORK, 1970-1979--Norton.  $18.95.  Back when 
she was a skinny punk, Patti Smith made a name for herself first 
as a poet and then as a rock star.  Then she got married, had
kids, moved in among Detroit's Auto Barons, and got middle-aged.  
EARLY WORK, 1970-1979 takes us back to her rebel days as a 
haunted visionary poet.  Most of these poems read as if they 
should be shouted from a stage, hysterically and with great 
emotion.  The prosey pieces are rambling and so pure that they 
didn't need any rewriting at all but just glopped out honest, 
straight from the heart.  If Patti has written any poems about 
her children, her life in the elite suburbs, or her career as a 
hypocritical poseur who knew that a media image as a moody rebel 
could make a fast buck, they aren't included here.--tw

Mark Sonnenfeld: MISCELLANY BY MARK--Marymark Press, 45-08 Old 
Millstone Dr., East Windsor NJ, 08520.  54 pp., $4.00?.  There 
are moments among these cleanly written but fairly conventional 
poems, of the short-lined "conversational" variety, when a more 
elusive/allusive and charged poetry seems to be emerging:

          His lunacy

     I dared not lock horns
     with 
     Those boots
     scuffed And a wide black leather belt
     was symbolic
     way back

The poems deal with daily life, music, reading, mass culture, and 
work, and often demonstrate a considerable sensitivity, to their 
topics, a step beyond the chatty flippancy often found in this 
kind of writing.--jmb

Mark Sonnenfeld: TEN INCH DIAGONAL--Marymark Press, 45-08 Old 
Millstone Dr., East Windsor NJ, 08520.  24 pp., $2.50.  There is 
an open and playful quality to these poems, many of which are 
quite free-wheeling in their juxtapositions of vocabulary and 
syntactical structures.  The poet seems to be enjoying himself, 
but this does not result in a mere facile silliness: the poems 
often also express a wistfullness and melancholy that, along with 
the techniques used, remind me of the work of Appolinaire and 
Huidobro:

     the lines
     of stars twitch
     as pigeon couples flyby
     the colored flare

     the republic grocer sweeps

     the simple of

     intimacy        alone
                         channels
     the bug sideways

A most refreshing collection, nicely illustrated with geometrical 
and technical diagrams.--jmb

Surllama mixed its texts up and performed a hack on it; later 
other defilers joined in the fun with separate hacks.  The 
results include a Chinese-quite disintegrated text cum over-
scribble by John. Lingner, a renga experiment by John M. Bennett, 
and a computer-generated "whered salm" by Ficus 
strangulensis.--bg

Curtis Taylor & Nico Vassilakis: SEVEN STEPS OF LOVE--Sub Rosa 
Press, 6234 Carleton Ave., Seattle WA, 98108.  $4.00.  Moltenly 
high-colored Tarot-occult illumages by Taylor on the following 
seven subjects: "Mouth," "Luck," "Risk," "Give," "Pierce," 
"Trick," and "Sip."  Accompanying them are seven equally 
energizing Vassilakis poems that move from a mouth that, 
devouring all, "will taste your skin 'til your thoughts are 
hinged at the mouth, and what air is here will mix with what air 
is in you," to the claim that "we are equipped with radar and 
music."  A jangle of textures, ideas and images that pretty much 
cover the entire range of human existence.--bg
     A small, accordion-folded booklet consisting of color 
illustrations backed by texts (7 of each), collectively having 
the quality of a set of divination cards, the images and texts 
being intriguingly ambiguous enough to accommodate a wide variety 
of readings.  The first one is "Mouth":

     Consider a circle, then consider
     what will fit inside that circle.  a
     mouth has mountains, a mouth has
     oceans, a mouth has the universe, 
     and all things are ingested easily
     within in it.  there is an 
     obstacle....

Tentatively, a Convenience: PUZZLE WRITING--Score, 812 SW 
Cityview, Pullman WA, 99163.  13 pp. (loose sets in an envelope), 
$3.00.  A sequence concerned with identical rectilinear forms 
that are shaped to be able to interlock, and sometimes they do.  
Each has a one-word label, "rocket" and "pedicab" being the 
labels of the two in the opening panel.  The background, with one 
exception, is a pictureless, doubly-exposed jigsaw puzzle.  
Intriguing events take place but exactly where the narrative is 
going beats me.--bg

Larry Tomoyasu: PHOTOS--Found Street, 2260 S. Ferdinand Ave., 
Monteray Park CA, 91754.  $2.00?.  A story dealing with fragments 
of childhood memories, accompanied by grainy b/w 1950's photos of 
little boys, in a small booklet produced with Found Press' usual 
hand-made elegance.  The story deals with motels, traveling, lost 
photos, and has a delightful episode in which "Johnee", perhaps 
the speaker's brother, is tossing Gideon Bibles out the window of 
a moving car.  The writing is clean, focused, and highly 
evocative.--jmb
     Story of an ordinary Joe who had lost a box of photos three 
years earlier.  As he and his friend from boyhood drive cross-
country in their search for the photos, stealing Gideon Bibles as 
they go, the Joe's simple-seeming thoughts and observations click 
strangely against the photographs of two children that accompany 
the text.  The result is an unexpectedly ed husk adorns the 
cover--at first glance it could be a drawing of a trendy 
hairclip, or the logo for an "Invasion of the Insect-Body 
Snatchers."  Trammell's collage, narrative and lyric poetry often 
brings the self right into the jaws of the locusts, but somehow 
manages to keep it from being gnawed down to the roots.  "Cicada-
-the True Bug/ of Apollo, that sings./ warns."--ssnf right into 
the jaws of the locusts, but somehow manages to keep it from

Apollo, that sings./ warns."--ssn

Nick Vaile: HARDCORE MOTHERFUCKER--WTG-Pubs., PO Box 12646,  
Lexington KY, 40583.  56 pp.,  Definitely an attention-grabbing 
title.  The first fourteen pages read almost like a journal; a 
gripping journal of the thoughts of a Hispanic factory worker in 
Dayton, Ohio, who exists in a vacuum of hate and violence.  This 
is an almost purging rant, a dispelling of evil.  "Anger is an 
injection of adrenaline laced with insanity,"  he tells us, and 
then relates to it personally: "I am a grudge holder, now and 
forever.  I cannot forget."  Vaile doesn't shy away from rough 
language, "My ex-mother-in-law is truly a cunt and a whore."  
There are also several poems about startling places, like the 
motel where "Deep ThroatÓ was filmed.  And more.  I can't say 
this is pretty, but then motherfuckers seldom are.  It is real, 
though.  Have you ever been shot at? This chap left me feeling 
like I had.--rrle

Nico Vassilakis: A NAME FOR RADIO--Elbow Press, PO Box 21671, 
Seattle WA, 98111.  12 pp.  Amazingly coy, this tiny little book 
is a treasure, something one could collect in a miniature 
bookcase of exquisitely produced examples of the art of the book.  
Seattle continues to be the hub of visual impact, whether it be 
grunge or in the fascinating twists and turns that visual poetry 
hammers into the unconscious.  What amazes me is the consistently 
high quality of it all--Vassilakis is an inspiration.--ssn

John Viera: SLOW MOVING PICTURES--Score, 812 SW Cityview, Pullman 
WA, 99163.  10 pp., $3.00.  Drawings, textual illumages and 
visual poems, all in similarly expressive, scribbly calligraphy.  
Includes a terrific 10-part impression of a poetry reading called 
"Minutes of a Poetry Reading at Rocky Point"--it reminded me of 
Saul Steinberg's visualizations of classical musical compositions 
without seeming any more derivative than all art is.  I was also 
taken with a florally-cursive rendering of the words "sign" and 
"song" in such a way that their letters look identical, so the 
one word shivers provocatively into the other.--bg

Fred Voss: STILL IN THE GAME--BGS Press, 1240 William St., Racine 
WI, 53402.  24 pp., $3.00.  In "Normal" we get tossed into an 
explosion of misfits, hippies, electric shock orgasms, out of 
body experiences, and the need to live life instead of 
disintegrating and hiding from the world. In "I Was Terrified" 
the opening lines, "He roared his bike to a stop/ on the sidewalk 
in front of the bay window of my apartment/ and stomped up the 
stone steps" sets up the situation where some strong willed crazy 
motherfucker thinks he's doing you a favor when actually you're 
too scared to get in his way.  In "Daredevils" we get another 
taste of hysteria: "My chair/ could barely hold him as he 
squirmed/ and told me/ what it was that got him off", where the 
love of bikes and riding left me wanting to get out there myself.  
This is pure well written insightful poetry, and although I've 
had a taste or two of Voss' work before, now I want to get it 
all.--o

Jeanine Wade: NECK DEEP IN LUST (29 Poems of Love and Lust)--PO 
Box 272, Goodlettsville TN, 37070-0272.  $3.00.  What can be said 
is that for sure Jeanine Wade is neck deep, waist deep, head deep 
and over her head and basking in, bathing in, wallowing in the 
moist from lust and love. Like 29 Arabian nights (knights)--
EARotic tales (tale).  Not the overt straight forward redhot mama 
tomato stroke and squirt and squirm strain and stain realism but 
playing with words and with the tools of poetry getting to the 
same place.  A different lush pathway to get to (on) the top of 
the orgasm mountain.  Many paths and sure this is perfumed but 
never skirts (lifted) the focus which is genuine physical and 
emotional passion.  The body is here and Jeanine Wade (wading in 
lust) hasn't forgotten that she has a mind, as well as a heart, 
as ...well, ass.--mb

Mary E. Weems (ed.), Susan Kane, Patricia Harusami Leebove, 
Kristen Ban Tepper: WOMEN'S VOICES--Burning Press, PO Box 585, 
Lakewood OH, 44107.  28 pp., $3.00.  The heartbeat of women: 
multi-cultural, multi-voiced, moon goddess proud and strong.  
This is a collaborative effort emphasizing women's artistic 
voices in one poetic collection.  Chimerical forces and tough-
minded introspection combine amid dances of raw experiences: 
motherhood, art, nurturing addictions, sensual dehumanizations, 
suburban imprisonment, love "my love like air like food like 
need."  The voices here are all pulled from deep history, 
genetically extracted: "and when I speak/ I use thunder/ 
thunder// it is my perfect voice."  They rage and demonstrate but 
never beg meaning.  Language and song, primitive and holy, guilt 
and lust, abuse and abandonment, all combined in these four 
women's voices, world rhythms bound in Cleveland.  Alkaline-
Electracharged resurrections of the mighty "I AM."--rrle
