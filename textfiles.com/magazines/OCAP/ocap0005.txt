ĮHow To Build a MARIO BOX!(Copier)!

Uses:Copy Nintendo Game Cartriges onto floppy disk
 


        Now after months of people talking about buying a 
        console copier (Video Game,such as,Nintendo).
        I decided to buy one,but I found out AFTER
        calling up and asking the price ,and crying.
        Said ,fuck it ...I can BUILD my own...So after
        many months of work ,and about 3 NiNTENDO's..
        I finally have it perfected ...kinda... 
        Heres what your gonna need...

1:Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
2:Alot of Electronic Stuff,Solder/Soldering Iron,Wires,alligator clips.
3:Resistors -Carbon 100ohm 1/4w (1)
b)Carbon 1.4k-Ohm 1/4w (2)
c)Carbon 150k-ohm 1/4w (1)
4:Resistor -10k x 12 (about 5 of these babies)
5:L.E.D. and a nine volt battery ..just for fun.
6:Lots Of Patience/Accuracy
7:You must ALSO vow to use this ONLY for pirating,any legal 
activity is strictly prohibited.
8:1.44/720k/1.2mb Computer diskette drive.
9:Useable Computer Supply. (Can't use the NINTENDO's adaptor!)
10:Modem ,(to illeagly upload the games EVERYWHERE!)


        First Of All ,To loosen up ,Ask your little 
        Brother/sister to hold the LED to the Nine volt
        battery ,and count backwards from 30.That s.o.b.
        will blow up in thier face ,and scare the shit
        out of them ,so it will keep them outta' your
        hair for a while.

        Second off ,you must remove all screws from the
        NES ,so you can take the top off,and then that 
        metal thingy...and then the black spring board
        you slide the games onto. Remove all wires
        from the motherboard. And take it out and 
        carefuly examine it ....

        WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
        Make sure that you are 100% clear of all if any
        Static electricity. This will prevent the
        static electricity from being absorbed into
        the NES motherboard ,and destroying the chips
        and delicate curcuitry.

        After you have completely memorized the look
        of the motherboard , Warm up your soldering 
        iron. And if possible ,a tool to help extract
        exess solder from all/any joints. And to
        aid in removal of any chips/resistors etc.
        Tools suck as solder suckers ,Vaccum Bulbs,
        Vaccum soldering irons (these are REALLY
        expesive ,like $500+!)

        Next ,Desolder the three resistors underneath
        the Expansion Port (that black thing covered
        in metal)And replace with three of the five
        10k x 12 resistors. Some of this may seem
        like shoddy schematics (if you are scheming
        this on your computer..or by hand)
        But it IS what is required to re-route all
        internal data transfers to floppy diskette.
        MAKE SURE YOU ARE PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT
                        WAY!!!

        Second thing that is required ,make sure
        you have ,on your computer...one
        of the cables from your power supply
        available for use by the nintendo & Disk
        drive. Since the nintendo has no need for
        video/audio RF (radio frequency) output
        it requires less power.Disk drives are
        designed to work under power limitations,       
        so all this comes naturally to your computer
        system.

        The Rest of the parts are just there to waste
        your money (if you bought before you read through).

        Now here is where you MUST READ THOROUGLY!


        Take the NES motherboard, ANd look VERY carfully
        at where the RF modulator is connected to the
        board, Now there SHOULD be 4 solder joints.
        Desolder them, And Splice some wire from there
        into the power supply line from your floppy
        disk drive. *MAKE SURE THE POWER IS OFF ON YOUR
        COMPUTER* The RED wire goes in the RIGHT hole.
        The Yellow goes in on the FAR left hole, and
        the Black And Black/Brown Wires go in 
        the ones in that order. (Black wire closest to 
        YELLOW goes into nexto the yellow. Black/Brown
        wire goes in next to the RED wire).

        NOW The trickey part. Wiring The 72-PIN Connector
        of the NES to the DISKDRIVE. Okay, When I say
        (ie) 1 to 5 , That means Pin 1 of the NES 
        connector to pin 5 of the DISK DRIVE connecter.
        This can be done by, Soldering a 2 Foot 
        (Longer usually better) wire to EACH PIN 
        of NES Connector. For soldering to the disk drive
        connector, You could either solder to the connector
        itself. Or the pins Of The connector.

        Here we go. [GULP]

                ^Z
                
As The NES See's the DATA Being Copied past its memory,
It will Run the program.
