             /oops, looks like this is coming out closer 
            /to the 20th than the 11th, eh? I guess I
           /should explain. Last weekend was the Mayors
     !    /Conference in Madison. I was away for two
         /days, and at almost the exact same time, our
        /Milwaukee indymedia site went down. It's still
       /down until Friday or so. Heavy bummer. Hectic,
      /stressful stuff. So even though ATI was on my
     /mind each day or so, publishing it wasn't. So I 
    /dropped a feature story or two in every once in a 
   /while and just put it off 'til things slow down a 
  /bit. Well they're almost slow enough to publish now. 
 /So tonite or tomorrow, you should be able to get this 
/in your inbox.

  ASKING: A Question About Unions And the Pursuit of Socialism:

  by BMC

  In a capitalist society, members of the ruling class use the means of
  production to accumulate capital. The working class is a part of the
  means of production, and individuals within that group own nothing that
  can be used to acquire wealth but their own ability to work.  There is a
  great deal of difference between the economic value of a factory with many
  machines in it and the value of the labour of one worker; the value of one
  body is practically nothing in comparison to the worth of a factory full
  of machines.  Because of the low value placed on labourers, employers have
  the ability and desire to treat workers unfairly by offering them low
  wages and poor working conditions.  The way for workers to gain control is
  through unity.

  In a factory each machine may only have marginal value, but all machines
  in conjunction with one another are worth a great deal.  As all of the
  machines in a plant are owned by the same person, they can be used
  together to mass-produce goods of value.  Human beings are much the same
  in that they are most valuable when used together in a workforce, but,
  unlike machines, employers do not own them.  Since workers are human
  beings, they are considered by law to have a slight degree of autonomy and
  all of the benefits and detriments that come with it.  For example, they
  have to supply themselves with their own food and shelter, even if they
  must live in substandard conditions as a result.  When workers are
  underpaid by their employers, struggling to make ends meet, receiving less
  than their fair share of the profit made by producing goods, it is time to
  take action to improve the state of worker/employer relations.

  As independent agents workers have little bargaining power, but in unity
  with other workers it is easy to recognize them as an important part of
  the economic institution.  Like the machines, goods could not be produced
  without their effort.  When workers organize and form unions, they can
  demand better working conditions and higher wages.  If employers refuse to
  meet the workers' needs, production stops.  Through unity the working
  class can organize and refuse to support the capitalist system unless they
  receive better treatment.

  A problem with unions:  like flawed socialist policy, union efforts are
  localized.  There are tonnes of unions throughout North America, and also
  many jobs that are not unionized at all.  When unions negotiate for better
  working conditions, they do it on behalf of the employees that work for a
  certain company or work at a certain trade.  They do not show concern for
  the working conditions of people outside of their own sphere.  Working
  within the system of capitalism, they demand higher wages in exchange for
  the perpetuation of capitalist production, and do not focus on the
  elimination of capitalism or the improvement of conditions for the working
  class as a whole.  In this way, they are only using the rhetoric of
  socialism to effect capitalist growth for themselves.

  As an example, unions were once more male-centered than they are now.  As
  more women joined the workforce and entered into less domestic-type jobs,
  there was a hesitancy to allow them to join the capitalist shelter
  provided by unions.  Because the prospect of offering union privileges to
  women would reduce the number of non-unionized workers, and therefore the
  privileges that the union workers enjoyed at the expense of the
  non-unionized masses, a xenophobic response was natural.  Male union
  members would have been likely to rely on myth and discrimination to keep
  privileges restricted to the already-privileged.  This exclusion of women
  was likely because one cannot advance one's own position in a capitalist
  society without exploiting someone else or, more accurately in this
  instance, allowing someone else to be exploited.  By keeping enough people
  out of unions, average pay rates stay low, inflation stays low, and the
  income earned by unionized employees remains relatively high.  So these
  so-called socialists are using their unions to lead privileged lifestyles
  at the expense of others, in this case women.

  As more women have joined unions, they too have developed the ability to
  exploit a new lower class.  As people in our society's lowest pay brackets
  get bumped up to white collar or unionized jobs, corporations do us the
  favour of finding new people, people in other countries, poor people in
  places with no labour laws, undereducated people, children, and other
  easily exploitable people to do all of our most tedious, most dangerous,
  and (most importantly) lowest paying jobs so that we can continue to
  improve our own standards of living while keeping the system of capitalism
  running smoothly.  Ultimately, as the improvement of our own lives within
  this system comes at other people's expense, unions are just another way
  of passing the buck, expanding North America's middle-class and creating a
  new, more desperate, group of working poor.  As long as we see personal
  financial growth as equivalent of success, we'll be staying safely away
  from making a real difference, namely the eradication of capitalist
  imperial imperialism and a bit of compassion for people other than
  ourselves.


Try to Relax

by David Soriano

The more you try struggling
Faster you sink
It can occur almost anywhere
With proper conditions
It is basically just sand
Saturated with water.
Mushy mix of sand and water
Supports no weight
Those struggling sink the fastest
Very rarely deep
By just trying to relax
Body lighter than the quicksand
Escape its clutches
And get on with life!


Quote Of The Day

"In these awful days, George W. Bush has become 
the American Yasir Arafat, an empty, repetitive, 
shifty public personality who talks out of both 
sides of his mouth, with little or nothing to say 
from either of ’em. Oh,  he’s still Israel’s man: 
maybe not quite as much as he was on Tuesday, but 
more than he was on Thursday, though by Sunday, 
who knows, he might be back in staunch-ally mode 
again, or conversely he might have a few encouraging 
words for the Arab side. He’s as purposeful as a 
wind-up toy boat with a bent rudder doing circular 
putt-putts in the bathtub."

BMG Buys Mcdonalds in $3dB Deal

FRANKFURT, Germany -- Mcdonalds Music and Food Group, 
owners of Britney Spears, 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys and
the Hamburgler, is exercising an option to sell out to 
BMG, the music division of German media conglomerate 
Bertelsmann AG.
  Guetersloh-based Bertelsmann, which already holds a 
minority stake in Britney Spears, Mcdonalds, Napster,
Vanessa Carlton, Heinekin, Pink, The Gap and Lou Reed, 
will buy the shares it doesn't already hold from majority 
owner Clive Davis, according to a joint statement released 
late Tuesday.
  A price for the purchase wasn't announced by the 
companies, both of which are privately held. WSJ, 
Financial Times and Billboard however reported it was
somewhere around the $3 decibel range.
  This move frees up the 78 McDonald's restaurants in 
Hawaii to finally add the new menu item they've been
working so long on perfecting - Spam.
  More than 3,000 portions of low- sodium Spam, scrambled 
egg and rice were served in a single day during a test run 
of the meal, according to Mandy Moore, McDonald's local 
marketing manager.
  "I'm not sure why it has taken so long," Moore said of 
the Spam breakfast, which she said is offered at no other 
McDonald's in the world.
  Hawaii residents consume 5.3 million cans of Hormel Foods' 
processed Spam luncheon meat each year, four times the national 
average. A favorite local variation is Spam sushi.
  This weekend, Hormel is holding a "Spam Jam" for the grand 
opening of its 16,500-square-foot Spam Museum in Austin, Minn. 
The celebration honoring the product introduced in 1937 as 
"the miracle meat" had been scheduled for September but was 
postponed because Bertelsmann hadn't finalized buying them
out yet.
  "With the acquisition of Mcdonalds, Bertelsmann will strengthen 
its global market position for the long term," they said. BMG, 
smallest of the big five record companies, has tried to expand 
by merging with competitor EMI but was blocked by antitrust 
authorities.
  Bertelsmann bought a 25 percent stake in Mcdonald's music 
publishing business in 1991 and a 20 percent stake in its recording 
unit in 1996, the company said. The sale is subject to approval by 
antitrust authorities and to final review by the companies.
  Mcdonalds' other artists include R. Kelly, the R&B star currently 
under indictment on charges of child pornography, Weird Al Yankovic 
and Michael Bolton. 
  Spam will be a very good thing for them too.
