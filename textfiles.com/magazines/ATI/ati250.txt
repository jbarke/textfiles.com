a lettuce from the editor:
I wonder if Bush OR Gore can locate
Chad on a map? They certainly need
attorneys, paralegals and seeing eye
dogs to find one on a ballot!
Hi all,
I'm back from the largest non-violent 
protest there's ever been. At least that's
my take on it. The military and the police,
and the military police tried their damndest
to get a violent response out of us knowing 
that interspersed with our group were many
members of Black Bloc (if I had to guess I'd
say 3 - 400 of us out there.) They remained 
nonviolent (but NOT WIMPY by ANY stretch) the 
entire time no matter what, just like most of 
them had consensed.
  Things were very scarey from the moment MP's
started confiscating cameras. There was a point
half way up our procession where they'd drawn
a line and said no press could pass. That was 
scarey because we had perhaps 1000 people lined
up 8 or 9 by a hundred or so, past that line, and
the rest of us were behind it.
  Things just got worse after that. You can read
about the police brutality and everything at:
http://atlanta.indymedia.org but I'll also point
you to one particular story that pertains more to
cyberspace human rights issues, since that's mostly
the only thing everyone in this list have in common,
eh?

Commandant Glenn Weidner said the military has "lost the 
information war, which is discouraging, but just when I 
tired of dealing with the protests, something here would 
lift me up. This is the best assignment in the U.S. Army." 

TIMELINE OF A SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS DIRECT ACTION PROTEST

| FRI | SAT | SUN | MON-THU | FRI | SAT | SUN | MON-? |

Friday Nov. 10th - A Giant skeleton puppet leads 2 dozen Atlantans 
on a march from Ponce DeLeon Ave to the Georgia State Capitol, 
bringing attention to the upcoming protests to close the School 
of the Americas in Fort Benining.
Fri - Buddhist monks and nuns begin walk from 
Atlanta to Columbus arriving about noon the 18th. Press
covers them fairly well.
11:35am Tue Nov 14 - Indymedia.org reporters Liz Guy and 
Josh Raisler Cohn publish "Climber Stages Symbolic Hanging 
at Fort Benning, Demanding Closure of SOA." Story gets 
reprinted and/or paraphrased in news organs around the world
almost instantaneously.
Wed - Demonstrators continue constructing "parade puppets" at
Koinonia Farm in Americus.
Thu/Fri - People begin pouring more heavily into Columbus, GA 
filling hotels and restaurants, campgrounds and parking garages. 
Saturday - Colonel Weidner tells Columbus reporter his SOA has 
lost the information war.
[http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/content/columbus/2000/11/19/news/1119weidner.htm]
Sun Morning. - US Army launches psychological warfare mission 
(which was likely begun even earlier.)
Noonish - activists plant corn seeds all over military institution.
People in Chiapas plant corn there at the same time to show and
act in solidarity.
Afternoon - 2 star general spends 45 minutes arguing politely
with 70 year old protester while other direct action continues. 
Monday - Columbus daily newspaper gives SOA Watch eighteen 
positive reviews and only two negative ones. A small handful 
are neutral including one which discusses the economic impact
the protest will have on the surrounding town. "SOA PROTEST A
BOON FOR ECONOMY: City, businesses could experience $2 million
bonanza as thousands visit," the headline reads.
Tuesday - Venceremos! 

  [somewhere in this timeline I should have put that Black Bloc
got almost complete consensus to show up in total solidarity
with the non-violent spirit of the event. But much like you, 
gentle-reader, I don't quite know where to "place" it. When 
even our most violent friends vow temporary non-violence for 
one profound event you know that everybody wins. Compare this 
with Bill Clinton announcing to the whole world "Well, it's 
clear that the people have spoken but we just don't know what 
they've said yet." -ed.]



Hola queridos mios: At the beginning I did this translation thinking of
my close friends and family.  Reading it again, however, I decided to
send it to other friends too.  This to suggest that you also share it
with your own friends.  It is as the elections in Florida are seen South
of the border.  Muchisimas gracias!  Pio

==============================================================
Poetic Justice (or how the empire adopted 
the political system of the "banana republics".)       
     by Carlos Rafael Soto     

   It is usually called, "Poetic justice".  In Spanish, "Justicia 
Divina", divine justice.  I am watching the perplexed faces of the
English speaking CNN analysts and I ask myself: ¿how could John Kennedy
imagine that, when applying the most inhumane blockade that no Nation in
the world has ever endured, the only thing he was going to accomplish was
to strengthened the spirit of Cuba and cause the emigration of all those
who for many years had lived thanks to corruption and to political fraud?
 John Kennedy opened the doors of his country to the followers of
Batista, and what he planted, now the United States is harvesting. The
greatest show on earth, designed to elect "the leader of the free world"
has ended up in a shameful and ludicrous fiasco.  As in any banana
republic, now in the United States people talk of fraud in some Florida
counties, of electronic manipulation to cheat thousands of retirees that,
everyone knew, were going to vote for Gore, and of the need for a vote
recount to determine the winner of the Presidency.  And in the heat of
the discussions numbers are brought up that one is used to hearing in the
Guatemala of the military rulers, in El Salvador, or, more recently, in
Peru of Fujimori and Montesinos.  In Miami (It had to be there!) in
elections previous to the one of the Tuesday recently past 17 thousand
deceased persons and more than 50 thousand convicts that, of course, do
not have the right to vote, took part.

   The millions of dollars that Gore and Bush spent were not enough. 
Neither the respect for the unwritten rule according to which, to
seriously seek the Presidency of the greatest democracy (?) in the world,
three unavoidable requirements must be met: to be white, to be
Anglo-Saxon and to be protestant (Kennedy was the only catholic who won
the Presidency and everybody knows what happened to him.)
 
   The spectacle, frankly, makes you laugh.   Not because of the
Northamerican people , who are angry and in disbelief, but at their
leaders.  It is like that story in which no one dared to say that the
king was naked.  The situation can not be more scandalous; however, the
illustrious and outstanding men of the OAS remain silent with the
greatest prudence.  No one has dared to suggest sending a mission of
observers to the United States, to investigate if there was fraud.  No
one has spoken of a mediation to see if Gore and Bush could accept that
the elections in Florida be repeated or, in the best Peruvian style,
adopt the idea of calling for new elections within six months in which
neither Bush nor Gore could participate (even though, according to what
is being said, the dirty business was done by Bush's people, in a state
politically dominated by Cuban exiles and governed, this is funny, by his
youngest brother Jeb).  Why Gaviria does not talk?  Why the OAS has not
been called to an emergency meeting to study the political and electoral
situation of one of its member countries, in this case the United States?
 
   Poetic Justice.  Divine Justice, without a doubt.  Forty years of
blockade to an heroic people and, as a result, to suffer the cancer of
the corruption that Cuba used to suffer before her Revolution.  Divine
Justice.  Poetic Justice.  Indeed!

         -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

"Why are people still fighting and killing each other?
We are almost in the 21st century. We are a tiny small
planet. Why keep fighting? Each nation has a beautiful
culture and dancing and music to share. Why fight? Each
religion has its own faith and compassion to teach. Why
don't we use faith and not weapons?"
  Rev. Jun Yasuda

     -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


Perhaps (talvez) we'll end with a parody.

To the tune of "She's Not There."
Made famous by almost everyone.

Well no one told me elections
Were rigged like this
My poli sci professor warned me
Now I'm really pissed

Well it's too late to ask for justice
How did I vote
Why should I care
Well please don't bother trying for fairness
She's not there.

Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
Our Lady Justice
The statue with her hair
I saw a scale there
We asked for balance
But she's not there



OPINION - "Black Sabbath" by Black Sabbath
was the best heavy metal album ever made.
No one has come close, many have blatantly
tried.
