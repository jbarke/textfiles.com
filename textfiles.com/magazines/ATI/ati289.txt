Hey,

Welcome to another fine example of Activist Times Zine.
Well, of course that's just my opinion but the rules
of advertising say you must remain 100% cocky at all
times. :P
  Wait, you mean I don't have to advertise? Great!!!

OK.

The Two Hundred Eighty Nineth edition no less. No more
either. On this day 01090923 Hours.

And what an august one it was!

Boyee,
  I'm behind on my zine again. Just been really busy! I'm trying
to learn LINUX and Cool Edit Pro in addition to all the other
things I normally do per day. Yikes!
  I just put my Bush protest story up to Indy. Lede was that he's
getting protested everywhere he goes. Everywhere.
  OK, one last thought, and I'm "outie."
  You'll know your tail is prior service or active duty when he
coughs into his elbow. I don't konw anywhere else besides the
U.S. military where THAT is taught, do you?

ps: now it's 01092050 hrs. Try not to let that confuse you. :)

Pax Romana

During the campaign season in the Fall of 2000 I was a staff 
columnist with the student newspaper at the University of 
Texas at Austin, the Daily Texan. I had  a few columns
published, but most were rejected because they implied 
the government should have something other than a political 
conscience. Journalists  have their in house rules to publish 
only the facts, and they resent the fact that these rules are 
superceded by another requirement: the facts they publish must 
be scientifically correct. Theoretically, every major newspaper 
should have all their stories vetted by a qualified professional
- and journalists per se do not qualify in this capacity.
  I had several long conversations with Victoria Hsu, the 
Executive Director of the Professional Engineer's Licensing 
Board here in Texas. As a P.E. myself, I was concerned about 
how my columns might be interpreted. What Ms. Hsu told me could 
very well change the way the media operates.
  Simply put, it is unlawful for anybody, anywhere to misrepresent 
the  facts to the public. The P.E. Board is responsible for 
enforcing this law (and every state has a similar Board, enforcing 
similar rules), and violators don't have to be engineers. Anybody 
who misrepresents the facts to the public is liable, for penalties 
up to and including hard time.
  Consider an example. I had one column on gun control that 
described how hand guns could be made safe. I literally designed 
a new handgun using  a few paragraphs of carefully chosen words. 
If anybody other than a P.E.  had done this it would be "designing 
without a license" and punishable as  such.
  In other words, journalists can present facts; but only licensed
Professional Engineers can make inferences from those facts.
  Consider another example. The FCC shut down a couple of low power 
radio stations here in Austin last year because they were critical 
of a big Fortune 500  conference in town. The authorities said they 
were illegal because they had no license.  However, their power was 
so low that their signal did not go beyond the city  limits, and the 
FCC rules apply only to stations with a signal much stronger than
that. The authorities who shut down these stations were misrepresenting  
the facts, and are technically liable for this to the Texas P.E. Board.  
From my conversations with Ms. Hsu, I have no doubt the Board would 
prosecute  this case aggressively if one of those radio stations were 
to present their  case to the Board.
  A few more examples: The President has implied that Global Warming 
is  not a problem. The Administration, in promoting only drilling in 
Alaska as a solution to our energy problem, has implied that energy 
conservation is  not a viable technology. Both instances are patently
incorrect. The President, as a legal resident of Texas, could be held
liable for "designing without a license" and for misrepresenting the 
facts to the general  public. The President can say whatever he wants 
about public policy. However,  when it comes to engineering and 
technology, what he says must be factual. It must be clear, 
unambiguous, and not subject to any interpretation so as to 
mislead the public. He cannot say one thing, while actually 
implying something else between the lines - not if what he 
says is technical.
  That goes for everybody else as well - 
  Especially politicians.

Hi there,
I was just writing to tell you that I saw your ad
while posting one of my own. You struck me as
the type of person that looks for opportunity just
as I do.
  About 3 months ago I joined a free discount
shopping club, It's an online mall like no other, 
It had ALL my favorite stores!
  Singer C.
  [ed note: what ad? We don't have any ads running
   do we? Accounting, get me payable and receivable
   on the giffy!!! - er, uh. Yeah, umm. no thanks.
   unless your mall can get me Tom's of Maine tooth
   paste refills, Brita filters and parts for my '94 
   mountain bike, my 1964 guitar, my 75Mhz pentium 
   linux box, my 1986 Volvo car or my harmon/kardon 
   tube stereo, I think you're outa luck there.]


& Just a Note:

ATI received more than 11 offers this week, (count 'em
12) to transfer amounts as high as $28,600,000:00 (TWENTY-
EIGHT MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS) beating a
record from a couple months ago of 5.
  The storm before the calm perhaps???

& NOTE RHYMES WITH QUOTE:

"Perhaps that is because while they [Europe] built their wealth 
on colonial slavery, they never worked as hard as the United 
States to systematically disunite and oppress millions of black 
people - for a century after slavery - within their own borders."

  & NOW A GNN LOOK AT COKE AND THE CIA.

It was during one of those late nights that Kolody first met 
a powerful businessman who, through his own intricate past, 
had developed strong ties to the intelligence community.
  This person was our aforementioned Tennessee contact.
  As an accountant to Fortune 500 companies, he must 
remain nameless in order to protect his current business 
practice.
  For our purposes we’ll call him Echelon.
 
Echelon

Echelon studied the facts of the case and, seeing the potential 
damage that a massive fraud and copyright infringement suit could 
pose to Coke’s bottom line, decided to help Kolody get to the next 
level.
  He began by warning Kolody that he was not dealing with a 
regular corporation.  Kolody begged for elaboration.  In a long 
and detailed explanation Echelon broke down the facts of Coke’s 
links to the CIA and its historical role as a global front for 
the U.S. intelligence community.  It was this topic that had so 
fascinated me upon my first meeting with him and one that I will 
touch upon briefly before getting back to Kolody.
  Throughout the late 1950’s and early 60’s the CIA began expanding 
its operations.  In order to effectively fight the Cold War on a 
global scale, it needed to establish bases in every major country.
  This meant that agents would need a plausible cover in order to 
penetrate the borders of international frontiers.  They couldn’t 
just show up with CIA stamped on their passport and foreign 
governments were getting wise to the tricks the Company had 
been employing to get their agents across borders.  As a 
solution to the problem the CIA was able to convince Coca-Cola, 
one of the first truly globalized companies with product 
distribution operations in virtually every corner of the 
world, to be used as a cover for the U.S. intelligence agency.

Why don't we try loving them

For their shark teeth,
