...this is too funny NOT to tell your friends. Remember when Bush was asked 
publicly if he knew the name of a foreign leader? Was it right before or after 
a major debate or something?
  Remember he said he didn't, and tried rhetorically to turn it around and 
ask the journalist if he knew - the journalist said he didn't and reminded 
him that he's not running for president?
  Maybe you already remember, I didn't. I just saw the most ironic thing I've 
read in weeks, I think.

  Pakistan.

Greetings, welcome to ATI. All Terrorism is Inept. Issue 304. Shortly after
the new moon of December, 2001. War is over. Or so they would have you think.
Vivendi owns Seagrams, now they own USA networks. What is it to own Rolling
Stone, MP3.Com, Houghton Mifflin, HSN: Home Shopping Network AND QVC: qWhat 
vDoes cQVCmean??? It's bad enough you get most of your music from a liquor
company. Now you can get liquor from an LLC. Wait. Vivendi is incorporated?
Holy cow. No way. When did THAT happen? Seemed like it was just yesterday.
May I remind you, this is NOT Iwo Jimo. Keep that in mind as you shrink back
to your viewing of Ricki Lake and Jerry Springer in preparation for whatever
will be the next "we interrupt this scheduled..."

Hello, 

I know you have no clue who I am.. 
But I'm contacting you about your E-zine.. 
I was wondering if you could run a small article on my band. 
  I wrote a small one below that you can use if you want. 
Its nothing super special but its plain and its straight up 
to the point.. We are a new band on the Internet and are looking 
for a way to promote our music and get some traffic going to the 
site. If you could do that for us it would be greatly appreciated 
by me and the rest of my band. Thanks for your time. And I hope 
I'll be hearing back from you soon.   
  Michael 

The Article 

Must See band!! 
Separated is a new and upcoming band that is taking the MP3.com 
charts by storm. Help the band to continue its success over 
the Internet and stop by and listen to a few of their songs 
in streaming audio.

To ATI:

I like to offer my deepest condolences to all Americans for 
the tragic death of the innocent people in the recent terrorist 
attacks against US.
  21 years ago my parents were killed in an insidious conspiracy 
in Iran in order to cover up the lost momentum of Islam in the 
world. Since then, these Islamic organizations, regardless of 
how they appear, have committed numerous territories acts all 
over the world. 
  Since I am unable to take the revenge of my parent's death, 
I bestow their blood to American people, and hope that together 
we can take the revenge of all the innocent people killed in 
these rootless terrorist acts. 
  Please forward this letter to as many people as you can so 
we can pay our share in strengthening the voice of freedom in 
the world.

To Activist Times from prime anarchist:

We also received 7 unique letters asking for the
prime anarchist opinion whether the Bin Laden tape
is faked or not. 
  Considering my weekly zine only averages about 20 
"letters to the editor" a month, I'd say we're being
pressured for an answer.
  Rather than an actual opinion, I'll give you this.
Leaving alone whether I think it's fake or not, I'll
point to just the fact that if you rule out people
who don't know or don't care, the two camps evolving
seem pretty evenly split. 
  Now you know why until about the end of Reagan/Bush
there was still great effort being made to keep audio
and video inadmissible in a court of law.
  What we have in the Untied States is a war president
and a law president. And he is obviously not above
subverting one to conduct the other, and the other for
the one, for that matter.
  Let us never forget that when Gore and Bush went to
war against each other there was a similar set of two
camps about evenly divided and at the time of the
Supreme Court choosing our president arbitrarily there
were no less than 9 law suits pending between the two
major parties. "Let's campaign against them, sue them,
plant stories in the papers about them, and if all
else fails just break their kneecaps," I can hear
them thinking. 
  Well Bush won.
  Or something.
  And then he starts campaigning against who? It almost
doesn't matter. "Let's war against them, sue them,
doctor footage of some Palestinian children jumping 
up and down applauding WTC 1 2 and 7 blowing up, and
if all else fails we'll just break Bin Laden's kneecaps."

Marco

ps:

  So do I think the footage is fake? It doesn't really
matter does it? The fact that it's being disputed at all
is mostly what I care about. We have the Blair Witch President
if you ask me.
  But if you must wrestle my opinion out of me, I'll point out
that Bin Laden had just attended a wedding. Well, ok four years
ago, but that never matters to people at PNN (pentagon network
news?) And then I'll go on to say we've probably taken his words 
right out of context. It was not the plans to blow up the building 
that was revealed at the very last minute people. Pull your head 
out of your television sets. He was talking about the bride! The 
groom is not allowed to see her until the very last minute. Nice
translation Prescott Harvard the III. Asshole.
  I may think it's a bad idea that Bin Laden became commander in
chief of the Taliban on August 30 of this year, I may think that
Bush and his father's CIA friends probably knew he was going to
become leader well before plans were laid out to destroy buildings
in NYC. I may also think that Bin Laden and his Taliban was not
the recognized government of more than 2/3 of the nation's people,
hell I don't think even 1/5 of the US population support a neonazi
like Bush. But I'm not going to make a movie mistranslating someone
who sort of looks like he might be Bush 6 years ago, saying he
planned the overthrow of the Gore-Errant administration.
  "Evil ones," see? That's my smoking gun. He was talking about
Tipper Gore, I knew it all along. Look, this video is proof poz!!!
Bush masterminded, premeditated and orchestrated the vote recount
right down to the hanging chad from deep inside his cave inside
NORAD mountain. Here's George W incriminating himself on my
Macintosh computer. 
  Pay no attention to the fuzzy lines between his nipple and 
Britney Spears' bellybutton, they're all the same person, if
you don't squint. Can you say Pagemaker? Can you say Photoshop?
Can you say BlueGreenAlgaeScreen?
  All we need is the foxy Albanian-looking woman with all that
and a bag of potato chips. George "WagThe" Bush.

INDYMEDIA COMMENT AS COLUMN

There's a connection between NegroPonte and the 
School of Assassins at Fort Benning, GA. Or he
may have been connected to it before the Panamanian
people kicked it out of their country which caused
the US to bring it "in-house," so to speak.
  I'm afraid I didn't read up on the specifics as
I was too busy with so many other SOA things at the
time he was up for appointment until now.
  I really should find out for myself. Perhaps 
someone else here could share from that. I do know
it's common knowledge public record type stuff, 
and George W doesn't seem the least bit concerned
that he's got known terrorists working right along-side
him.
  It really makes me want to know more about exactly
what kind of a goon "W" might have been for Reagan
and papaBush during their tenures. Perhaps the embedded
corruption that's been cancerously inserted since at
least as far back as Nixxon didn't go away during 
Clinton, it just went to the private sector for a 
bit until they could get Jeb or W in, eh?
  And don't get me started on Cheney, there's a missile
silo in Laramie Wyoming that was named after him in
a ceremony while I was in Colorado. It made me very
sick to my stomach. I almost don't want to talk about
it. I'd rather think happy thoughts.
  Oh, quick trivia along those lines.
  Anyone know what George "W" Bush's favorite pillow's
name is?
  I just learned this...
  "Pilly."
  I wonder if he sucks his thumb too, when things don't
go quite exactly his way?

SOMETHING LESS THAN A TRAITOR: An Open Letter To NPR

I really wanted to call today about this John 
Walker case but I called in 6 days ago.

Could you just mention to him that I have a
possibility that I don't hear any of the pundits
discussing.

Was Walker in there as deep cover CIA and
something got screwed up where he was supposed
to die or escape, and now to avoid an international
incident, our wonderful openly democractic government
has to deny his work as an operative or agent?

It sure does look like that to me. And much more
importantly is the fact that if he ISN'T CIA, what 
does our government do about the fact that CIA are 
doing exactly what I just described with the full
blind support of Congress.

What makes what Walker did treason, yet what the
dead prison riot operative did was heroic?

Sounds like Benedict Arnold and Nathan Hale all
over again.

Anyone remember Eugene Hassenfus?

a little piece of satire
Steven Ransom

Vernon Krebbs is a patriotic columnist writing for a so-called 
‘respectable’ broadsheet. The sole purpose of his weekly column 
is to counter the growing allegations of establishment corruption 
and to persuade readers of the wisdom of US national and foreign 
policy. 
  Insulated from reality and well-paid for his imaginings, Vernon's 
column this week is entitled:

BACK OFF WITH

THE CYNICISM!

..The Pentagon has just released information on the joint arrest of 
superstar tennis pairing Ivan Landl and Anna Kournikiva at JFK airport, 
following the discovery at Terminal 3 of a tennis racket, clearly of 
foreign manufacture. Fears were heightened by the fact that the tennis 
racket had been found carefully concealed inside an unmarked, beige 
carrying case! 
  Heading up the investigation is detective superintendent Eugene Morales. 
Said Morales, Aside from the colour of the carrying case and the fact that 
the racket had been so carefully hidden from view, we had the very odd 
situation with Landl’s travel bag. It seemed. well, how shall we say it
"rather hurriedly- packed?"

more at
 http://www.whatareweswallowing.freeserve.co.uk/terrorism.htm 

      And on a more serious note

It won't come with jackboots and book-burnings, with mass rallies and 
fevered harangues. It won't come with "black helicopters" or tanks on 
the street. It won't come like a storm, but like a break in the weather, 
that sudden change of season you might feel when the wind shifts on an 
October evening: everything is the same, but everything has changed. 
Something has gone, departed from the world, and a new reality has 
taken its place.

TO NOTE:

It's exactly 9:11 AM Tuesday exactly three months after the WTC.
  Other than the fact that I looked up at the clock because an
NPR host was announcing "exactly three months to the hour since..."
nothing weird happened on that very minute.
