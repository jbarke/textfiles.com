A Rhetorical (for now) question. Was Elian/Miami mere
prep-training for Vieques?

Another quote? Sure. Check this one out:

their content. They give a great response, then do another
stanza that nobody wants to hear."

Hey there, hi there, ho there. We're as sappy as can be.
I'm prime anarchist and this is ATI222. Does anyone
remember the show Room222? 
  Me either.
  Ready for my rant?
  Me either.
  I think I dislike the songs "Take 5" & "Take the A Train"
just enough to write a combined parody. Hmmm. How about
"Take the 5 Train," a variation on two themes, by Mark
Weisenheimer.
  Me either.
  OK here's a "page 3" correction. ATI will no longer use
the phrase "Changing The Face Of The World." A crease &
resist order has been graciously accepted from the owner
of the words (even before it were sent!) and we will do
them even one better, agreeing never again to use the words
"world," "face," or "change." As for the words "the" and "of"
sorry, no can do. We tried, we really tried. But we'll have
to take liberty there. So sorry. Did somebody say "Pound Sand?"
  The Donald McRonald Rainforest Policy - reduce, reuse
recycle, what a kroc!
  The lady dragging Elian out of his 5am temporary Miami
home, did she drop him just outside the door jam? I thought
for sure that's what I saw; but now they won't show that part
of the footage anymore. They just keep showing reruns with
gaps the size of old Nixxon tapes. Did she drop him or not??
Show me! Is that what CNN meant by resilient? Oye! Como VA!!
  When the DOWn plummets, just show NASD and S&P Futures for
an hour or so, it'll fix itself soon. Keeps 'em from seeing
the down triangle with the big numbers, eh?
  Is Ananda Lewis getting whiter every week as fast as Mariah
Carey? Um. I don't think so. Not for lack of trying though.
Bucking for Oprah? Front page, mayhaps?
  Mandy Moore, Jean or Khaki?
  JELLY is the University of Chicago Juggling Club. Stands
for? Jugglers Enriching Lives Like Yours.
  F0XFamily SClub7
  Anyone ever seen it?
  Me either.
  It's about as formula as can be! A cross between Spice
Girls and Onda Vaselina -- unfortunately, it badly falls
short of both!
  I want you to snap out of it for just a second and admit it.
It's NOT talent, beauty OR dialogue that gets you high here, 
keeps you captivated long enough to take in some 5.9 commercials
at a time.
  It's teenage navel.
  And verily I say the joke's on you. Because these teenagers?
Aren't boppers at all! Shiny, happy, eating-disordered 22-yr-olds.
  OK Go back to your usual programming now.
  Me either.
  Who said this: "I'll vote McCain with or without Bush, but I'll
have to hold my nose."
  Don Imus.
  And "who's ya chief executive?!, who's ya chief executive?!
who's ya chief executive?!" IBID? Close, Bubba on Imus' MSNBC show.
  OK, one more. "It depends on how you define 'interview.'"
  --Joe Lockhart 4-25-00
  And what if I don't WANT Ben Stein's money???
  Me either.
  http://www.whymilk.com Britney then at 3 and now at 18. Ummm.
Sorry peeps. They didn't HAVE milkmustaches (at least not owned
by ADF&MProcessors) in 1985. 
  "DISLAIMER: TOUCHED UP PHOTO" should be right there in 10point
bold. 
  And finally ending this rant, I have an OPEN LETTER TO JAY
SEVERIN.
  Pound puppies, ex-hipster. If Gore WERE a socialist, or even
a republican, I might vote for him.
But he's NOT a socialist, Jay. Go back to either torts or western
civ. and get some more head-nourishment. 
  He's a pro-police-state democrat, Jay. There's a big difference.
Just because your linear model works in Boston doesn't mean it'll
work in NATty Politics, OK?
  One robin don't mean spring.

To The Editor Of ATI
    With recent "denial of service" attacks on such hosts Yahoo!,
Amazon.com, and etc.  I ponder today thinking, who is at large
pulling off these attacks and then using the hacking community
as a scape goat?  After all the hacker ethic is to never harm
computer systems, and that is now happening frequently enough
that the media, general public, now believe we are no longer
people of this nation, this world of people that want freedom
of information, but we are neo-terrorists.  Now, you and I believe
that the general hacking community believe in strong ethics such as
never harming a computersystem, never use your skill for your ego,
and etc.  But one thing is clear, there are/is a community of
crackers that have been recently making US look BAD. Now we can
express are views all we want to the media, politicians, and
general public, but that will do nothing more then make us look
like lyers in their eye.
     So I post this message today, with my bad spelling, and my
crappy speach to ask, what can WE, members of the international
hacker community, do to get the politicians, media, and public
off are back?  Because after all, we are not harmless, but we
have a sense of true responablity with are talents, we do not
use them to harm any one, and we don't use it against the
government. But crackers out on the net use such talnets as
mentioned above to do those exact operations, and we are there
scape goats.
     Well anyhow, I must get going, please feel free to speak
your mind..
Sincerely,
GiGKiLLeR

Hey Marco,
Just a note....the WTO riots here in the Seattle area were horrible.
Peaceful protesters were teargassed, pushed around by police like
cattle, threatened with arrest JUST for being there.
Welcome to Amerika, where they SAY we're free but smart people
know better. The doors to the independant media building were
barricaded shut by police trapping the people within inside the
building.
Suppose that building had caught fire? The Seattle mayor sucks and so
do the police. Peaceful demonstrators were hurt by the police, and their
right to assemble peacefully were violated in many ways. Even a reporter
for WBAI was pushed around by police, when she showed them her
press pass, the cop was heard to say "I don't care".
If the cop didn't care then they shouldn't be a cop.
(You can find this on the 2600 webste in the Off The Hook archives.)
Police everywhere are out of control. (Unarmed NY man shot 41 times
by police for example.)  Times are changing in the world, and people
are starting to protest more and more. It is our right as Americans
to peacefully assemble and don't let anyone tell you different.
--Deeply Shrouded & Quiet

Hello,
I just completed another new article you may want to use in 
your ezine. If you do use it please just drop me an email
message when you do so. 
  This article, "How to make money giving your stuff away
for FREE", is 845 words (95 lines at approx. 55 characters
per line) also counting the signature at the end.
  If you decide to use this article...
  Everywhere you turn on the Internet today, you can get 
almost anything for free. Free...free...hosting, you name
it, chances are, someone out there is giving it away for
free... This article discusses how you can make  more money
giving your product or service away than you would selling
it the "old fashion way" like every body else.
  Marketers call the concept of giving products away a 
"loss leader".

An Open Letter to the Hattiesburg Public School District
To the Administrators, Teachers, and Students of Hattiesburg High
School:

I am a 1982 graduate of HHS. It would be fitting to say that of all
the classes I took at HHS, there was no class I enjoyed more than
Journalism I. Mrs. Neda Richards was a very tolerant teacher, as
she put up with my antics in the classroom.
Either thru luck or good writing, I had a few pieces published in
the school paper, "Hi-Flashes". I still have those today, saved
for my own son, Matt.
  In the years after graduation, I have used my journalistic skills
more than a few times. I have written stories for company newsletters
and small newspapers. I am also in the process of writing a book
called "The Hosshead Companion", which is about the music of Waylon
Jennings.
  But one of the biggest joys of my adult life was having an article
published in an electronic magazine called Activist Times, Inc.,
concerning an entity called Channel One called "Barbarians In The
Classroom: A Look At Channel One". The article dealt with
commercialization in public schools via the Channel One TV
program and the efforts taken to have it removed from local
schools. Therefore, I was extremely shocked and saddened when
I found out my alma mater is now a Channel One school.
  If you've never seen a "Simpsons" episode called "Mr. Lisa
Goes To Washington," here's the plot. Lisa wins a patriotic
essay writing contest, and wins a trip to Washington D.C. to
compete in the national finals. In her search for inspiration
for her entry, she witnesses a crooked senator accepting a bribe
from a lobbyist. Suffice it to say my reaction was similar to
Lisa's.
  As you are no doubt aware, Channel One has been called "the most
controversial show on television". And for good reason. Schools that
sign a contract with Primedia (Channel One's parent company, also
parent company of RJR Nabisco) are loaned TV sets for each classroom,
fixed-band satellite equipment for reception of the program, two VCR's
(one for recording, one for playback), and enough coaxial cable to wire
the school.  In return, the HPSD agrees to show the entire Channel One
program, including two minutes of commercials. They also agree to show
the program to 80% of the students present, on 90% of scheduled class
days during school hours.
  It troubles me deeply that the HPSD would become involved in such a
psuedo-educational venture. The stated purpose of Channel One's
existence is to "penetrate the teen market". And it does that very well.
Companies such as Coca-Cola and M&M/Mars pay millions of dollars to have
their commercials aired on Channel One. These advertisements do not
generate any income for the HPSD, but are required nonetheless to
carry them if they want to keep TV equipment they don't even own.
  Commercials aside, the Channel One program itself is also controversial
in the fact that materialistic attitudes are not only developed, but
encouraged. This, in my opinion, is a very unhealthy attitude to foster
in a classroom. Not to mention nutritionally questionable foods such as
Pringles and Snickers.
  Many educational associations oppose the use of Channel One in schools.
These organizations include the National PTA, American Federation of
Teachers, and the NEA.
  In case you're wondering, there are other news programs out there.
CNN produces a news program tailored for High School students called
"CNN Classroom". This program is produced by an award-winning,
internationally respected news organization, not an advertising agency.
And, it can be received over any rooftop antenna (on WMAH, ch.19 for
those without cable) free of charge. And, there isn't an advertisement
in sight.
  I call upon the Administration, Teachers, and Students of HHS to put
an end to commercialization in the classroom. Standing on your principles
and refusing to compromise journalistic ethics for a company that sees
you as little more than a marketing tool would be the best lesson for
all concerned.

Attorney General Announces Break-up of US.
Coyatoga, MAINE - [PAWN] SEC will be the theme from here on in,
according to Cyrus McMabell, assistant to the AG. 
  "Seperate, equal and competitive," he said reading an official
statement just thirty-two minutes after the closing bell friday.
  He said the country will define exactly who "gets what, and 
when and how," but there will soon be a "U" and an "S" and each
will only get one of each from the following pairs:
Coke   Pepsi
McDonalds BK
Democrat Republican
Regular high-test

  McMabell said after three years they'd be allowed to begin eating
each other out again. Until then bored members will NOT be allowed 
to sit on each others' boards more than thirty-two minutes at a time.

MCRONALD'S ANNOUNCES HOSPITABLE TAKEOVER OF TWO CHAINS, EYES A THIRD.
[PAWN] - Kroc Park, ILL. 
  by Terry L. Savage - special to Pine Americus Wild Nudes
  Y2K was very very good to Donald McRonald.
  Jack F. Greenbacks announced in his annual 3-color newsletter,
"I'm delighted to report that we added two McBrands to the McFamily
in '99 - Dominatrix Pizza and Sawchucks Coffee. Dominatrix boasts
bread, meat, cheese, and flavoring, and Sawchucks is known for roasts,
of English coffee 'just in time for tea.' These McCiting concepts now
join McChortle Mexicali Grill as trailblazers in our strategic McEffort
to capture one of each. Soon enough we'll have 99% of the total McMeals-
away-from-home McMarket. At that point we can finally McRelax."
  "We are also excited," he said "of our agreement to purchase Kenny
Rodgers."
  He said if he can buy both Rodgers and Jimmy "AYCE" Buffet, they can
take over both the rainforest AND the everglades.
  "That'd be a McHoot!"
