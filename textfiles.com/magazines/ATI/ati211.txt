Shortly before midnight, the Karmapa apparently jumped from his
bedroom window and was whisked away in a car, along with his
24-year-old sister, who is a Buddhist nun, two aides and three
monks. The group of seven drove non-stop for some 36 hours,
following almost the same escape route that the Dalai Lama
had traversed on horseback 40 years before. The car stopped
ahead of security checkpoints, where the Karmapa alighted,
circled around the barriers and rejoined his comrades on the
other side. When the road came to an end near unmotorable
mountains bordering Nepal, the party began a trek.

you in Indian Country every moment of our lives. Thank you."

Hi there,
I'm prime anarchist and I'm your toast for tonite,
the half moon frenzy upon us. I got a spam report
from Sisyphus, our resident Linux guru deep within
serverland. I'll quote him here...
  "I'd just delete anything that looks in the least
bit wierd.  (I know that'll cut down on your Letters
to the Editor for ATI, but it's better than getting
Windo$e hang-ups.)" We took his advice to heart which
might have saved us some serious hackerhassles, as the
last two weeks have seen lots of weirdness. So if any
of you sent in a letter to the editor or a submission
that doesn't make it into this zine or the very next
one, please resubmit. I'm not thumbing my clothes at
you, I just chose to ignore some. Better safe than
story sometimes, eh?

LET THERE BE LETTUCE 

Execellent coverage of the Stupor Bowl in last issue P. A.  
You did however miss three important things.  The guy that 
tackled head first (haven't we learned by now that that's a no-no) 
showed us all what football is all about, again.  The second thing 
was the only positive moment of the night (I didn't see the apple 
commercial).  Yes I'm talking about the Oxygen comercial.  Just 
something very cool about baby girls throwing away their pink caps 
in defiance.  The third is by no means as important as the other
 two, but it need to be said: "Tony Braxton, I'm sorry but 
African-Amerikan womyn should not where tight white dresses 
when they are cold at Nationally Televised Events like the 
Stupor Bowl.

Poet Ruled 'Only a Pest' In Opening WTO Protest Trial
  Reprinted from LISE and LISA's SEATTLE POST-
INTELLIGENCER stories.
               
   Eric Larson might have been loud and obnoxious during World
Trade Organization protests, but a jury yesterday decided he
did not break the law.
 Seattle's first trial stemming from the WTO mayhem focused
on the alleged assault of two police officers by Larson, 34,
a coffeehouse manager and poet.
  [prime anarchist note: I don't know yet whether he's my
   old friend Eric who did one year in Leavenworth yet.
   I'll letcha know the minute I verify]
 This was the first of about 40 WTO-related cases slated for
trial in Municipal Court in the next few weeks. They are all
that remain of about 500 misdemeanor cases, most of which have
been dismissed due to lack of evidence.
 In her closing argument, Assistant City Attorney Cindi Williams
said Larson screamed at the officers, hoping to "spark the powder
keg" and set off a riot.
   [maybe Eric's our man who ran into a crowded firehouse last
    April-1 yelling "Theatre" at the top of his lungs]
 Defense attorney John McGoodwin said Larson may have been rude
to police but he had no intention of becoming violent and did
not assault anyone during the protest.
  "All you can convict this man of is being a pest," McGoodwin
said. He argued that the officers were too tired, hungry and thirsty
to be sure of what happened, adding:
  "There was just too much going on."
   Larson was accused of pushing a King County sheriff's deputy
who was part of a police line. After being pepper-sprayed, he
also allegedly struck another officer who was trying to arrest
him.
  Larson denied pushing or hitting anyone. Observers captured
part of the incident on tape -- audio and video -- but that 
evidence proved to be inconclusive. Witnesses testified during
the trial that Larson was pepper-sprayed several times at close
range, grabbed by about five deputies and wrestled to the ground.
   Larson, who lives and works at The Pearl coffeehouse in the
University District, claims he went downtown that day to take
pictures of the WTO protests for the Poem Record, a literary
magazine he edits.
  The trouble started when Larson, a former Army medic, tried
to get through a police line to buy more film. Both sides agreed
that Larson was pepper-sprayed at least twice...

WELL, WHICH IS IT?
  The last few months I've heard that UNAM is the
biggest college in the world, the biggest in the
contintent, the biggest in Mexico and the biggest
in the hemisphere.
  Never mind which hemisphere (as I've heard west
and I've heard south) I was wondering where truth
really lies, and after 45 minutes research (way
more than I wanted to put, by the way) I still don't
know. "Damned big," and "almost none bigger" is
about the closest I'm going to come to knowing real
truth there, without going myself and walking around
every campus on the planet. Believe me, I've got
enough trouble getting the whole way around UConn,
and University of Wisconsin.
  At any rate, here's some of the results of my
digging. You'll see that UNAM is pretty big on
understatement when it comes to self promotion and
some of the other places of "higher education" veer
far away from the truth to beat their chests.
   [ed note: I chucked out any claims with too many
qualifiers like "largest college with a library open
at 5am, serves cappucino and charges no late fees,"
or "largest college on the western half of the southern
hemisphere not counting ones at higher than 6,000 feet
elevation."]

OVERHEARD IN "NEWS"
   "As someone said so eloquently before,
   'Dude... duuude.... *sigh*   dude...'"

& in other news briefs this week...
West Texas: Larry Tannahill is refusing to allow his
12-year-old A-student son, Brady, to be tested for
drugs by the Lockney Independent School District.
Mandatory testing for the district's teachers and 400
students in grades 6 through 12 was completed Thursday.
  Brady, the only holdout, now faces the same punishment
as someone who tested positive: a 21-day suspension from
extracurricular activities, at least three days' in-school
suspension and three sessions of substance abuse counseling.
  The sixth-grader also could be required to take a drug test
every month for a year. Each time he refuses, he will be
considered a repeat offender, and the punishment gets more
strict.
  Tannahill plans to appeal his son's suspension.

South Dade: High School student journalist Leandro Leon was
working on a story about random weapons searches of students
Wednesday morning when school officials confiscated the film
from his camera.
  "This experience has taught me that some things need to be
exposed to the public and things need to be shown how they are
and not necessarily just reflected in a good light," 17-year-old
Leandro said.
  During first period, Leandro took one photograph of four guards
from Vanguard Security getting ready to search students in Reisa
Plylyer's sophomore English class.
  When the guards realized Leandro had a camera, they cleared
classroom 512 and locked him inside.
   [how many human rights violations; let me count the ways...]

  [couple quick anarchist notes: this is the same campus where the
   "mexican kent state" happened back in 1968; and this time around
   although they beat some of the students nearly to death with 
   billy clubs, federales chose to leave their larger weapons behind.
   Possibly progress? We'll see]

PAWN - Des Moines - Quaker Groats and Squibble are Forming A Joint
 by Brief Shorts. Special to Prime Anarchist Whirled Gnus.

The Quaker Groats Company is entering a venture with Squibble,
Novartis, Pfizer, Combover, & Gamble LLC to create food containing
ingredients said to cause cures. The new company EatOurFood, will
develop and market its products in Mexico and distribute to Canada
and the US. Gregor Panza, president of EOF (short for EatOurFood)
would not divulge much, "something tells me we're into something
good," and "clearly this is an example worth everyone knowing and
trying."
  Such products' examples include cholesterol-reducing candy, 
healthful hamburgers, cereal with flesh-eating-bacteria-killing
soda to offset the laden bananas that might get sprinkled atop by
children of unbeknownst parents and 20% embalming fluid in the
morning cranberry juice so teens and adults alike will be "way 
ahead of the eight-ball."
  "Good to the last drop," said Panza, a pediatrician turned poet.
"You'll love our goodcookies, Mr. and Mrs. 'Merica."


   "That was only the beginning of my problems with 
multinational record companies. By 1984 I had sued the 
two industry giants, CBS and Warners, and had learned
a lot more about 'creative accounting practices.'"

   -- Frank Zappa, in an autobiography.

   "...and, it they don't get it, have a tendency to
initiate counterrevolution."
   -- ibid. [There's dozens of reasons this ("The Real Frank 
Zappa Book" is a very great book, but another one is the fact
that I got to page 331 before finding my first typo]
