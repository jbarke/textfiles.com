Part 4-Homemade Media Literacy

In the 1990's a new term sprang up: Media Literacy. 

What the heck is "Media Literacy", anyway?

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

A hundred years ago, newspapers were the main form of mass communication 
in the US. But, for the most part, newspapers were locally owned, and 
dealt with local issues. A newspaper in Columbia, MS didn't report on 
news in Billings, MT unless that event had a significant impact on the 
residents in Columbia. And, unless one traveled, very few copies left 
the publication area. 

Of course, radio began to mature in the 1920's. But many of those early 
stations were disorganized, with no real sense of purpose or direction. 
Many left the air permanently. Those that survived were very organized, 
with a sense of purpose. 

In 1926, the National Broadcasting Company was born, with flagship 
station WEAF (purchased from AT&T) and 15 other stations. NBC carried 
its programs to its stations via AT&T phone lines, with the network 
paying the bill. Eventually, NBC (and later, CBS) built its own wire 
network, independent of AT&T. 

Two years later, NBC added another broadcast service-The Blue Network, 
with the original network becoming the "Red" network. WJZ in New York 
was the flagship station for the new network, and presented a different 
program lineup than the Red network. In the 1930's, NBC added yet another 
network, the "Pacific Coast Network" or "Orange". Unusually, the HQ for the 
Orange network was in San Francisco (KPO was the flagship station), and the 
programming consisted entirely of repeats of Red and Blue network programming 
from the east, as NBC had not yet crossed the Rocky Mountains with its wire 
network. Eventually, NBC crossed the Rockies, and the Orange network was 
folded into the Red and Blue. When that happened, KPO gained a sister 
station, KGO. (KPO was Red, KGO was Blue.) 

But, perhaps, the reality of the effect of mass media could have at 
any given moment occured on October 30, 1938. 

A group of radio actors headed by Orson Welles, called "The Mercury 
Theater On The Air", which was famous for adapting short stories to 
radio plays on the CBS Network, decided on this night to adapt 
H.G. Wells' classic "War Of The Worlds" as a radio play. The first 
half of the story was told as a series of news bulletins and "live" 
reports surrounding a martian invasion of earth. 

The effect of the broadcast was such that despite being in that night's 
radio lineup, (and a station break halfway between) some of those who 
listened thought it was the real deal. After the broadcast, Orson 
Welles stepped out of character to reassure listeners that it was 
a play. "We annihiliated the world before your very ears and utterly 
destroyed the CBS. I can assure you, both institutions are still open 
for business.", Welles said. But, reassurances from Welles aside, many 
groups petitioned the FCC to restrict the content of radio programs. 
CBS assured its listeners that it would not allow its programs to use 
fake news bulletins again.   

In 1941, the FCC issued a study on chain broadcasting, and recommended 
that "no license should be granted to any station affiliated with a 
network organization maintaining more than one network". In the FCC's 
opinion, NBC's two-network system was not in the public interest. To 
avoid losing potential affiliates, NBC sold the Blue Network in 1943, 
and became the American Broadcasting Company in 1945. 

All the while, a new form of broadcasting was being perfected. 
Television in the US was in its infancy when World War II broke 
out (CBS even ran a special report on the bombing of Pearl Harbor 
on its TV station, WCBW). The FCC curtailed TV broadcasting to 5 
hours per week, and issued no new station permits. When the war 
ended, TV stations sprung up in record numbers. Many new stations 
were co-operated with well-established radio stations. 

Radio soon began losing listeners to television. To compensate, 
radio stations began looking for ways to attract new listeners. 
In the mid-1950's, stations that began playing popular music on 
a regular basis scored high ratings. Personality radio became big 
business. In many cases, the announcer playing the records was 
just as popular as the records being played. Bruce Morrow and 
Robert W. Morgan are perfect examples of "personality" radio 
announcers.

Another event that proved the power of television occured 
one weekend in November 1963.

John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade in 
Dallas, TX. CBS Radio was the first major broadcast entity to 
announce the death of the President, almost 20 minutes before 
its TV service, as well as its competitors. From that time until 
the following Tuesday, all the major networks stayed on the air 
for "round the clock" coverage, which was unprecedented in TV. 
It's been said that on that weekend, the US went into "collective 
mourning", with TV as the guiding influence.

During this time, the FCC began drawing up ownership guidelines. 
The FCC was concerned about the concentration of media into too 
few hands, and decreed that a single entity could own no more 
than five VHF TV stations (channels 2-13) and two UHF stations 
(channels 14-83). 

In the 1980's all this was about to change. The FCC relaxed its 
ownership guidelines. Thru lobbying efforts, large broadcasting 
companies that were previously restricted in owning stations were 
soon gobbling them up. It is now common to see companies owning 
hundreds of stations across the country. And frequently, this 
same company owns most, if not all, the radio stations in a given 
town. In efforts to cut costs, most of these company-owned stations 
became, in effect, translators; rebroadcasting a single feed from 
satellite to subscribing stations, with just enough local programming 
to satisfy the FCC.  

TV stations were affected also. Chances are, your local Fox station is 
owned and operated by Fox itself. Beginning in 1994, Fox purchased New 
World Television and Citicasters. More often than not, the bulk of the 
stations purchased by Fox were in the VHF band. Even more important, 
most of the stations were longtime CBS, NBC, or ABC affiliates (some 
since the 1940's and 50's) that now were required to switch to Fox. 
However, the other three began purchasing their affiliate stations too. 

Now, you may ask, what does all this mean? 

It means that most everything you see, hear or read is owned and 
operated by a big media company. And, some have interlocking boards 
of directors. When Fox took over WAGA television in Atlanta, which 
had been a CBS affiliate since 1948, not many in the CBS hierarchy 
worried about it. CBS has a deal with Fox to distribute home videos 
of CBS TV programs. Certainly, some griped about it, but in the end, 
CBS and Fox decided they needed each other. 

And what is the motive of large media companies? To make profits. 
For themselves. For shareholders. Remember, in this day and time, 
profit is supreme. For a company that pitches products to children, 
the LAST thing they want is responsible parenting. 

For a child, unbridled TV watching is not a very good idea. Even 
more so today. Companies spend billions of dollars to reach your 
kids. And, it's mostly for products that will not enhance their 
well-being.  

But at the same time, TV is a reality. It's here to stay. The best 
approach is to monitor your kids' TV habits. My son Matt is not 
allowed to watch any TV whatsoever until his homework is completed. 
If he turns the TV on before his work is done, he loses his TV 
privileges for the rest of the day. 
 
Talking with your kids about TV is a great idea too. What guidelines 
do you have? What will you allow your kids to watch? And, what 
happens if the child doesn't follow the guidelines? 

If there IS something you won't allow, tell your child WHY. 
Why do you not like it? If your child wants to see it anyway, 
ask "Why do you want to see it? What do you expect to get out 
of it?" In all likelihood, it won't be something your child 
will like. 

Hollywood DOES create a lot of movies you and your kids 
won't like. 

Videos are another area of discussion. Most folks own a VCR. 
And, many have membership cards at movie rental stores. 
When you go into a video store, do you look at the videos 
your child gets? Some stores won't rent inappropriate videos 
to teens if they're by themselves, but won't say anything if 
a parent is in attendance. 

So, the ball is in your court. It's up to you.

PoMeRiC: A Found Poem
  by marco

Darling Nikki,
Here's those songs deaLING with rape, 
incest, sexual violence and perversion
A socioLINGuistic study of oral tradition
HolLINGs, Trible, Gore, and Hawkins and
PMRC compiled a mailing list feeling that 
the RIAA had sold out.
  Hollings indicated that he would seek a way
to control the actual selLING of records.
Tipper Gore, and Jeff LING took the witness stand
because the task of controlling the masses is not 
always an easy one.
  Albert Gore, John Danforth, and Ernest Hollings
forgot about several prevaiLING themes.
  SampLING disputes have produced an interesting 
twist, "voluntary labeLING is not censorship,"
felony for selling another 2 Live Crew cassette,
and closure and structural coupLING.
  With the Senate Hearing on Record Labeling
and self-restraint in the form of voluntary labeLING,
arrest for the selling of obscene records has the 
"chilLING effect" 
  And of course after the Court of Appeals ruling
the legal ball got really rolLING. PMRC office 
space in Arlington, RIAA for faiLING to comply,
court rulings on popular music actually selLING
the album, debate over the song’s impact LINGer 
on.
  Meanwhile, maiLINGs to interested parties
like Jeff Ling, dealing with backmasking, and
the rating and labeling system.
  And finally one thing having nothing to do with
the word "ling," but everything to do with 
labelLING would have to be:

HOLLYWOOD AND WHITEHOUSE MERGE
(PAWN) Californington - Friday, amid rumor and speculation
of a 5-way friendly buy-out of Ryder, Rollins, Hertz-Penske,
Secret Service LLC., and Bob's Private Bodyguard Company,
White House officials will announce Monday that there
will in fact be a merger but it will only involve the
executive branch of the US Gov't and the particular movie
companies that make up an LA cartel called "Hollywood."
  Teen spokesman George Stopangawkatus reports that there
will be no downsizing and all business operations will
remain the same for the time being.
  "The only two big differences," said the teen, "is that
everyone will get union scale and not only will the POTUS
be allowed to use cocaine, heroin and marijuana, but it
will become socially unacceptable not to.
  Mick Jagger could not be reached for comment.
