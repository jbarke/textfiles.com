FAX: 202.456.2461

DEAR SIR / MADAM,

I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE
NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY
SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL
BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO
AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE.

I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN
ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ. MY
PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY
MY FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR
OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE
NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UNSUCCESSFUL VENTURE WAS SOON
FOLLOWED BY A FALLING-OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE
ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF KUWAIT, A
WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.

MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF
SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST,
THIRTY-SIX BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS PARTNERS
IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF MONARCHIES, AND
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN AND JAPANESE PARTNERS.
BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI BUSINESS PARTNER REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM RESERVES.

MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL OF
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF
HIS COUNTRY, AS COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM FROM POWER.
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN
OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE MAY COST THE SUM OF 100
BILLION TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 -

$200,000,000,000), BOTH IN THE INITIAL ACQUISITION AND IN LONG-TERM

MANAGEMENT.

WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE
THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND OUR
COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. OUR DISTINGUISHED
COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY, WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER
IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE HALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY, AND
CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS
DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER.

I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT
(10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS IMPORTANT
VENTURE. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL
FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY. I PROPOSE THAT YOU MAKE THIS TRANSFER
BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF APRIL.

I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE APPREHENSIVE
AND WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF THE
DAY. A BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I ASSURE YOU. PLEASE DO BE
INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO
CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR INTERMEDIARY
REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE MATTER.

I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES WILL BE
FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE CONTACT NUMBERS
BELOW.

SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,

GEORGE WALKER BUSH

Admit it: Christmas was a retail bomb this year.
Downright down, every indicator. Everyone you 
talk to has a friend or relative about to close
down a small business soon. Things are tanking 
all around.
  So expect this year's round of Superbowl ads
to be a full frontal assault on your senses, your
ethics, or your sense of ethics even.
  Yup, they're gonna be decadent, wasteful and
decadently whistful. Nearly a waste of time, but
quite the diversion. It should be interesting.
We'll have to see what we see, eh?
  Ready? I am.
  4 million dollars a minute. Wow. Expect the 
graphics to be "louder" than a broken soundbarrier.
Or one of those red&white peppermint candies!!
And don't expect next month's Grammys ads to be
any classier either. They'll be exciting, sleazy,
excitingly sleazy and about as decadent as they
come. 2 or 3 million a minute I'm sure. 2nd or
3rd biggest american ad-cycle of the year, depending
on who you talk to. And the Grammys are going to 
be sooooooooo boringly boring, the ads are going
to serve as some sick form of comic relief.
Have you heard any music this year?
That's what I mean, have you heard ANY?

I mean, unless you count Avril trying to sound
like Pink or Pink trying to sound like Pink. 
Eminem trying to sound like Marilyn Manson,
and James Taylor trying to sound like, well, 
I don't know what you'd call that.
And Billie Joel thinks he's Ted Nugent or 
something. Drunk off his ass smashing into
a tree. Now that's rock and roll to me.
And Aerosmith?
Dare I call it music?
Quick, someone ghostwrite us a song or 
we're going to start wearing those yellow 
spandex pants again.
OK, I'll hold my hands over my ears and
scream it out loud so I don't have to hear
it. 

"Music!"

"Grammys! Music."

"Music! Grammys."

They used to mean something together.

 & LETTUCE



 In early February, John Ross will join hundreds of international
 anti-war activists on the Human Shield Action Caravan to Baghdad in an
 effort to stop U.S. bombing of Iraqi civilians before it begins. The
 caravan is being organized by Ken Nichols, a former U.S. marine who
 participated in Operation Desert Storm. All travel expenses are being
 paid out of pocket by the volunteers and Ross, an aging
 poet-author-journalist-activist who dwells in and around the poverty
 line, is appealing for contributions from those who would like to be
 part of this action for peace but are otherwise committed, to offset the
 plane fare to Istanbul where he will join the caravan on February 4th
 for the bus ride to Iraq.  

 To discuss donations:
 John Ross
 1030  Capp Street
 San Francisco Ca. 94110.  

               Ross's Statement of Purpose follows:

"I GO TO BAGHDAD TO STAND WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE, NOT WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN"

 A decade ago, in the wake of the Persian Gulf conflagration, I traveled
 to Kuwait on behalf of the Palestine Aid Society to expose human rights
 abuses against Kuwaiti Palestinians by the Bush-Sabah regimes.  During
 that mission, I had occasion to visit the infamous "Highway to Hell"
 where on February 28th, 1991, 22,000 fleeing human beings (United
 Nations estimates) were incinerated by wave after wave of U.S. warplanes
 flying in off the Gulf, a little-remembered massacre now.  "It was like
 shooting fish in a barrel" one U.S. pilot told the press.
 By the time we got there, the desert was a vast parking lot of charred
 vehicles.  Unexploded cluster bombs and infants' car seats were strewn
 along the shoulder of the highway.  The Yanqui ground troops had come in
 with spray paint and scrawled obscene slogans on the burnt-out cars.
 The scene put a heavy hurt on my heart and I vowed to myself that this
 would not happen again - at least not in my name.
 I am a journalist and an author based in Latin America and war and
 repression, often the result of U.S. policies, are the coinage of the
 countries in which I work. 
 Nearly 40 years ago I traveled from my home in the Purepecha Indian
 mountains of Michoacan Mexico to sing Bob Dylan's "Masters of War" to a
 judge, and read him a poem by Bertolt Brecht which says we live in an
 age so dark that it is a crime to write a poem about a tree because it
 is a kind of silence about injustice. Then I was led off to Terminal
 Island federal prison in chains, the first draft resister from the San
 Francisco Bay Area to go to jail for refusing to kill my Vietnamese
 brothers and sisters.
 I have opposed every U.S. aggression against the world's people since
 and George W. Bush's impending dismemberment of Iraq is no exception.  
 I go to Baghdad gratefully to stand with the Iraqi people, not with the
 corrupt and undemocratic regime of Saddam Hussein. 
 I have no illusions that the U.S. President will hesitate to bomb his
 own citizens as well as Iraqi civilians.  After all, over the past
 decade the White House has seen fit to inflict death on hundreds of
 thousands of Iraqi children for the crime of having been born in a
 country ruled by Saddam Hussein. 
 The coming war will be a cruel one.  Early United Nations estimates
 calculate a half million casualties - we may indeed be included in that
 total.  But what else can we do?
 In recent years, I have become closely identified with the rebellion of
 the largely Mayan Indian Zapatista Army of National Liberation in
 Chiapas about whose struggle to preserve and strengthen their indigenous
 identity and still be players in the wider world, I have written three
 books now. The Zapatistas' war against oblivion, against being
 obliterated from the face of this malevolently globalized planet, is the
 story of all peoples rooted in history and the earth, and the Iraqis are
 some of the world's most ancient peoples. 
 If George Bush is to consummate the genocide of the Iraqi people, I'm
 sorry to say that it will have to be over my dead body.   -

Hasn't ANYBODY dared to say, even yet, that this whole 
War-With-Iraq thing is a cheap shot ploy by Georgie-Porgie 
to get himself reelected?  I mean, c'MON now.  Every goddamn 
time the RepubliKKKans get into the presidency, we have a war.  
And the deficit gets bigger.  And check it out for yourself, 
it's you and me - the little guys in this country - that pay 
for it all.  In blood AND money.  Makes me sick.  Goddamnit!
 If you guys that demonstrated had ALL VOTED we wouldn't even

Dear ATI and/or person(s) lazy,

I just got done reading John Stockwell's book "Praetorian Guard".  
As is noted in the book, any thing he  publishes must first go 
through CIA censors do to a court ruling when the CIA sued to 
try to stop him from  publishing.  I came across the one part 
in the book that cuts out mid-sentance and says something like  
(segment cut do to CIA censorship).  The sentance was about 
students studying abroad and the CIA.  So what  about students 
studying abroad and the CIA?  If I met John Stockwell I'd ask 
him what he had to say on the  subject.  I know this isn't 
about the Kobar or Khobar Towers, but I thought I'd ask you, 
anyway.  §)~

 ahhh. 
(11:42:43) 
 just got back from dc. :)
 How was the marches? Er... How were the marches?
great! 
there were a little more than half a million 
in dc alone. Haven't heard numbers from sf and other 
places yet. Expected some of those to be equally humongous.
Me and 4 others from IMC Norway are going to Iraq next week. 
 hey...lots of hot stuff going on in dc right now. 
check out the breaking news
yeah, wow!
 i'm compiling it...and i keep getting these amazing calls...
is dc doing any live audio, or should I just 
listen to blastfurnace right now, or what?
 um...wbix is doing some live stuff...w/our reporters.
later today, i'm going to be on wpfw later i think
i want news from dc..
1:15pm: Sgt. Scott Sear of the US Park Police=16 were arrested. 
Charges unknown. People are just drumming and chanting. It is 
like a big street party on H St. along Lafayette Park. 
 how many do you think are in the streets today? 
and do you think there were as many as halfmillion 
yesterday? to me it felt like 4-500k
 no...lafayette park people=about 1,500. 
youth and student march=several thousand.
 today? thanks.
 yes. today
 next person that calls breaking news line will be asked for estimate
 what's your wildest guess for yesterday?
1,300 (our count) - 2,000 (police count) in honolulu
crowd estimate today=2000. 
 big time arrests about to happen in DC
so.. how do we get ppl off the street?
 Tell them there's a sale at K-Mart
 cops are letting traffic through the road.
 10000 in brussels today
(13:37:00) 
 thinks capitalism is in deep doodoo, yet again. 
I would think this is good news, but the silly
 system shows an amazing survival capacity
20-30 people squatted the entrace of the german-netherland
-corps and took down(why is there no word for "get the flag 
down" in my dictionary?) german and nato flag
 how was DC? huge and cold, i know that much
 great! largest mobiliation I've ever been part of
 san francisco looked like Fun! never been there for 
a big rally. it is my favorite city, though..
 last count i saw for DC was a bit over 300k. seem about right to you?
 closer than most corporate media that's for sure.
 did you see the newswire report about what a paper in 
colombus ohio did with the numbers? supposedly they said 
"hundreds of anti-war marchers" and dig this "thousands 
of pro-war demonstrators"
 wtf???
washington post said around 150,000, which might be a bit conservative
shoot, i saw it way early this morning before coffee. 
it was either on global or DC
Here's my take so far: 
http://flag.blackened.net/ati/zine/senseofnumbers.html
 woohooo! have you seen the pictures of the SF ins building? :)
Yeah, those SF pictures are mighty inspiring!
 of course i never advocate of apologize for illegal activities :)
 gloats
the starbucks and victoria secret seemed a bit beside the point, 
but the ins and the uk counsolate, well, se la vie

In so far as Starbucks and Victoria Secret are symbols 
of cultural imperialism and hegemony, they might as well 
throw a brick or two as they pass by. But, yeah, I was 
impressed that they went after the INS and the UK Embassy.
 Starbucks and Victoria Secret were probably just along 
the route, I highly doubt they were explicitly targetted.
listening to the breaking news, it sounded like the cops were 
relatively tolerant untill Victorias got trashed.. does that 
say something weird about the police pychie? :)
 Yeah, I thought that was a bit funny, too.
 "Hey! My wife shops there, and they make her look hot! 
I can't take anymore!! MUST ... USE ... BILLY ... CLUB!"

(14:57:38)
bush is a lot more like hitler
just, lacking the brains. and the little moustache
that was the key to hitlers evil, i think.
nooo.. he's more like the head of a columbian junta.
heh
hitler was democraticaly elected however
the next global day of protest is Feb 15th, right?
they were announcing it yesterday, but i couldn't hear it
i was pretty far back
yeah. you *know* there was no fraud in *that* election.
 y'all see this from portland? "J18 organizers deny press 
packet to portland indymedia reporter"

people were jumping the fence onto the white house lawn...hooly crap! 
that is hardcore
 i think that was a dozen or so
 1:55pm: 50 people went through the fence surrounding 
the White House--they are being arrested.
i wonder if the po po could handle a couple hundred 
people rushing the fence at the same time
i would so jump the fence :)
(15:28:03) 
____: there's a time and place for shit like that. 
when the cops arn't doing anything at all it just 
people were throwing paint bombs

people goin over the fence at the white house is at least as radical 
as smashing up windows. maybe more so

violence is useless

copsalready know everything about black bloc
in gotenborg they had an investigation about the riots
and it turned out that some cops participated and provoked them

Below is a picture of the oil tanker before Chevron quietly 
renamed it the "Altair Voyager" and before President George 
Bush appointed Ms. Rice as National Security Advisor.
 i don't care about being arrested...just don't want to miss my bus
but how many people?
but many red, black and black and red flags
oh. 25,000 wow
in london on feb 15th, everybody is trying for a one 
milllion march. this is what stop the war coalition is saying
the west's leaders may ignore one million but the middle east 
and the arab world will notice
i'm hoping the feb15th will draw huge numbers here in toronto
hopefully it's not too cold out
if we got 20k yesterday...50k could be possible!

 damn, reading down the features wire, you kinda get the 
feeling lots of people around the world think war is a bad 
idea or something?
 "The breakaway marchers ran down sixth st. to get away 
from the police. They came to the SF Chronicle building. 
One bunch held off the cops at one end of the block, one 
bunch did the same at the other, while the ones in the 
center graffited the Chron building." -- now that's good
