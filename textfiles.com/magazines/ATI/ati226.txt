  I'm Prime Anarchist and this is my column for Sunday
nite:

 Before getting any rank within any police force in the
 United States, 
 Promptly after being indoctrinated at FBI school in 
 Georgia,
 Before returning to his or her hometown worksite where
 a poorly trained peace officer is a potential danger to
 the local community,
 S/he shall be required to receive no less than four hours
 of non-violence training under the venerable Father Roy
 Bourgois and followed by at least four hours of Aikido
 under instruction of Joan Baez.
 
 The best way to achieve this would be for the newly renamed
 School of Americas to be charged with the secondary mission
 of allowing young Latin American student-soldiers to train
 these peace officers in non-violent assertiveness, cultural
 awareness, and many forgotten philosophies such as those
 espoused by Gandhi, Budda, Jesus, MLK, Leonard Peltier, and
 James Hoffa, Jr.

 The following people shall be required (not asked...) to
 address each graduating class. Agosto Pinochet, Madeline
 Albright, Sup Marcos, Julia "Butterfly" Hill.

 For then and only then will a human once again be able to
 tell his or her child with all faith and confidence, "If
 you feel scared, confide in a cop."

So, How in the heck have you been?
  Do you remember holding previous conversations regarding business
and money making opportunities. I did not send this to you in error!
  You said: "If only I could find an easier way to make a higher
income" and "If I had more money, I could spend more time with my
Family, and less time at work" and "I sure could use more money so
I could pay off my bills once and for all!" and "I would love to
get involved in a business in which will generate money while I
am not at work (like a Gas Pump)" Dear Friend, 
  [ed note:][uh,,, no. +++]


OPEN LETTER TO A FRIEND:
Thanks for your great words, ______.
> As someone who was not in the "in" crowd in school when 
> I was a kid, I can honestly say I understand the frustrations
> that the songwriter feels...but I  believe this song to be
> very disturbing.

  I agree. I wrote it on Amtrak the night after learning that Bishop
Gerardi died in Guatemala from having his head bashed in with a large
piece of cement. To say I was "a little disturbed" would be the
understatement of the last millenium. It took us two years to prove
it but I knew that right at that moment his assassins were trained
at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, GA. With our tax
dollars' support!
  I'm afraid the only two ways I could describe how I knew this
would be 1) the Jesus moment*, &  2) poetry*.
  * by the Jesus moment I mean that same "space" that was portrayed
in the movie about Archbishop Romero when he walked into the
catholic church and took out the sacraments. The young soldiers
could point their Hasbro M-16 machine guns at him but they COULD NOT
shoot him. It's like skating on thin ice or walking on water. The
Jesus moment.
  * by poetry I mean, I was sitting on the capitol steps friday 
saturday and sunday myself in the middle of protesting SOA. We were
jubilant. Gerardi had just published the book "Nunca Mas" friday nite
and was being wined and dined all weekend for his ten full years of
work on the REMI project which categorized as many dead and disappeared
as he could learn about: which ones were at the hands of SOA grads,
which ones weren't. Two nites later he was killed. The man who came
to the capitol steps sunday morning (11am) to inform us was an Episcopal
priest or bishop. He was weeping when he told us. We cried with him. He
explained that the Sunday before that he was in Central America giving
a high mass alongside Gerardi. That's the last time he saw the man alive.
His friend was sitting on the Capitol steps telling us this and in my
head was an endless loop. "I killed Gerardi. My taxes killed Gerardi;
our SOA killed the Bishop."
  I cried all the way home from DC to Connecticut. Somewhere between
my mom's house and DC I managed to finish that song through the tears.

There's a better format of that song now at:
http://www.dkp-ml.dk/MUSIK/soa.mp3 if you care to hear it in something
closer to my own voice. The wav was a little higher pitch than my true
singing voice.

Also I have three slightly more "upbeat" songs at
http://www.mp3.com/MarcoCapelli now.

YES!
  I'm with you there. 
  My first thoughts after the initial shock of watching all the
Columbine footage, was these kids are demanding all the right
answers, but they don't know how to ask the right questions.
  They're half way there. They understand things are messed up,
foul and heinously wrong, but they lack the "spirituality"
(joseph campbell's definition, I don't have a better word for it)
to pull off positive, slow steady improvement of the environment
around them.
  I was gladdened and megaheartened to see Seattle and A16, and I
look forward to:
  Philly and LA next month, and also the 40 days of "culture of
nonviolence" that fellowship of reconciliation is putting on in
DC on the capitol steps once again.
  My generation (born 1966 myself) is finally getting back to its
earlier path before Michael J Fox and Ronald Wilson Reagan co-opted
it!

My complaint about Mr. Marc Frucht

As poorly-qualified as I am to expose Mr. Marc Frucht's half-measures for
what they really are, I hope you will bear with me while I begin this
sincere
and earnest attempt. And please don't get mad with me if, in doing so, I
must deal summarily with what I call raving gutter-dwellers. Here's the
story: Marc is not a responsible citizen. Responsible citizens supply the
missing ingredient that could stop the worldwide slide into despotism.
Responsible citizens unequivocally do not devise pusillanimous scams to get
money for nothing. His reports are not witty satire, as Marc would have
you believe. They're simply the...
               ...last statement is a bit of an oversimplification, an
overgeneralization. But it is nevertheless substantially true.
  With friends like Marc, who needs enemies? Certain facts are clear.
For instance, prudence is no vice. Cowardice -- especially his
iconoclastic form of it -- is. I could accuse Marc of using short-
sighted airheads to get his way, but I wouldn't stoop to that level.
Does he have a point? I doubt it.
  Mr. Marc Frucht should reserve his stereotypes and labels and remember
to treat others with a bit more respect and equality. That's all I have
to say.
  Thank you for reading this letter.

Post office Web site goes from .gov to .com
[PAWN] Washingtoon - The USPS, reflecting the growth
of its electronic business, has changed the address
of its internet site from http://www.usps.gov to
http://www.usps.com
  Addresses that end in gov are generally used by
the government, and USPS is a semi-independent part
of that gov. Kind of like how public radio takes ads
from a couple different groups of people and corporate
entities, PLUS receives grants.
  USPS is making this change for many reasons we here
at PAWN don't understand, really. We wonder if they do.
  People who use gov will get a notice about the new
site URL. Forwarding will take place onsite.

YOU READY FOR THIS?: GAK Soy Products Gives A Gonzo Spin
To The Prime Anarchist
  by GAK Soy Products

I see, so with that in mind, let us go on a marc type rant and
see how original it is:
  Well...OK, you ready for this?
me either... you like My website full of acid induced drivel?
me either... Am I about to go on yet another useless psuedo
beatnik rant? probably so...
  so this coffee cup next to me was screaming "gimme some shit,
Jack...I gotz to be going on mah waaaay!" Just then the traffic
noise hit mr. peanut got off the couch I turned on the TV
It was like MTV in a time machine and there was martha quinn
only more buxsom...
  So i snapped mah fingers out of time to her talkin...
then the neighbor dog barked...which made me think
"those goddamn bastards..they can't do this to me...I'll fucking
sue!" then a knock on the door...The handle turned martha quinn
turned into martha stewart and I had to shout at the door "you
fucking commie bastards!" 
  "you are wasting the buzz of the PRIME ANARCHIST!"
"there will be hell to pay"....the grotesque looking man gave
me the parcel the fridge made a horrendous howl "gimme that...
Now look what you've done" still snapping fingers and martha 
stewart had martha quinn's chest
  "I'm not signing a fucking thing, now leave before I call the cops"
"....I'm the FUCKING PRIME ANARCHIST, and We don't grock anything!"
grock, grack, gack, yak.....Milk...thats it YAK MILK!
I hurriedly grab my keyboard...the dog barked again, sounding
really pissed I type the next installment...of the Writings of
the PRIME ANARCHIST
  martha was cooking, I could smell it...then the microwave buzzed
more traffic noise...had to grock the parcel...couldn't almost looked 
like a fed-ex...but couldn't make it out fingers still snapping,
if there was a beat, the snapping was off keyboard wasn't producing
what I expected...more traffic car door slam...was it an 80's video
or a more recent rap video matters not, I am the PRIME ANARCHIST
  microwave was still buzzing...mr peanut was getting perturbed
the fridge still howled...the bathroom fan was overwelming
"STOP ALL THIS GODDAMN NOISE" I shouted "I am the PRIME ANARCHIST...
and will not sit still for this" I began jumpping up and down like
a madman... but out of time to the fingers snapping...which was
out of time to everything else the parcel looked smug, "Aren't
you even going to take a peek?" the frozen burrito jumped out of
the microwave and lept toward me I stomped the hell out of it with
my shoe...told the parcel to shut up mr peanut rolled his eyes...
he began to snap his fingers in time to mine 
  "How the hell do you do THAT!" I yelled...
  martha was back, couldn't tell wich one "I'm going to sick Nancy
Reagan on you" I yelled. still snapping fingers...they started to
bleed "It's all comming *TRUE*, everything I have ever read!"
mr peanut shrugged, opened the parcel, it was a check and a letter..
"goddamit what does it SAY!" I stoped snapping, the entire earth was
quiet. Stuffing the check in his breast pocket, Mr peanut let the
letter fall to the ground, threw his cane over his elbow, walked
toward the door "You MISEREABLE goddam NUT, what does it SAY!"
  I woke to the noise of the fridge peanuts everywhere
there was the letter there was the burrito all over the floor
it was daylight, but the TV didn't work "where's martha"...
I cried sheepishly. I read the letter "here's your advance
give me 5000 words by noon thursday" was all it said....
more dogs? I wondered...
no martha
no check

BEST PANEL OF THE MILLENIUM SO FAR
LA Times Festival of Books brought out
Virginia Postrel, David Horowitz, Arianna Huffington,
and David Frum to discuss "American Popular Culture."
  Basically Frum discussed his book "How We Got Here:
The 70's," when it applied to American pop cult, and
even when it didn't. Ibid for Huffington who's got a
hotty out now called "How To Overgrow The Government."
And of course the same went for Horowitz, who wrote
"Hating Whitey and Other Opressive Causes." Of course
he thinks his entire life is pop culture, and he's
surrounded by leftists, liberals, nonwhites, women and
socialists, and some people who are all of that at the
same time. Postrel, who wrote "The Future and its 
Enemies," tried to keep her discussion - and even at
times wished out loud the others would follow suit -
to the topic at hand, whenever possible.

[temporary side rant: David Horowitz is a mere Ronald ]
[ Reagan wannabe. "Um, Mr. Horowitz, your time is up,"]
[   "Uh, Mr. Horowitz," "I'm afraid I have to," "Mr.  ]
[ Horowitz, your time is up." "David, shuuuutt up!!!" ]

  Idea for another great panel:
Same type of four authors plugging books they care
dearly for. One rule, other than that, full open
discussion, Q&A to follow. 
Rule 1: you can refer to ANYTHING except your newest
book or one you're writing this moment.
