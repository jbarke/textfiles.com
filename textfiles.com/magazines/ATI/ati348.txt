Bevis Head

to ATI:

You probably won't print this letter to the editor, but 
I think your review of the Grammys stinks. 

I think all you do is get yourself in a mean spirited, 
hateful space and watch it with a notepad in your lap 
ready to slam every single artist no matter how good 
he or she is.

You hate everyone don't you? Or even if you don't you're 
willing to libel us til we want to cry. You're just like 
the corporate media no matter how much you bitch and 
moan about hating the media yourself. 

Always looking for someones feeling to hurt.
Everyone's a critic. You're probably just a 
crybaby because you don't have your own contract
with a major label.

[name withheld at request of sender. (claims she's
in the industry.)]

[ed note: the re-gifting bag you get for being
nominated was valued at more than my house, lady. 
I paid for your consolation prizes manytimes over 
subjecting myself to those stupid ads and product 
placements during 3 1/2 hours of vomitous greedfest. 
I can write whatever I want about it. Thanks for 
your opinion nonetheless.]

COLUMN FROM THE PUBLISHER

"You think of Bill O'Reilly describing himself
as a 'working class guy,' this from an accountant's
son who grew up in Levittown NY., the El Dorado
of the postwar middle class."
  --Geoffrey Nunberg in his Sunday Times article
"How Conservatives Pidgeonholed Those Poor Liberals."
[easy reading if you're neither.]

"Or listen to Ann Coulter who grew up in New Canaan,
Conn., [I just knew there was something Ronnie James
Dio about her!] and her paean to the New York's other
boroughs: 

'Queens, baseball games -- these are my people.'"

Why the prime anarchist is neither lib NOR con:

1) Drives a Volvo (must be lib)
2) Drinks coffee plain (neocon)
3) IQ over 100 (must be lib)
4) Defaulted on Student Loans (must be GOP)
5) Wears Birks allyearround (DNC/DLC for sure)
6) Wears blue cashmir overcoat (republican!)
7) Refuses to wear tie OR blazer (uh, neither)
8) Comes from the working class (must be GOP)
9) Disses work as classist (neither again)
0) and the number 0 answer is:

Equally resents Bush/Lieberman/Hitler/LaRouche. 

+) Bonus answer: Although he's tabled and
given small talks at both Harvard and Yale,
he was "educated" at neither, so he's not 
ALLOWED to be a liberal OR a conservative.

Newroz is coming, are you ready? Oh, you don't
celebrate? Don't even know what it is? March
21st. Soon enough it's time to leap over a
large fire.
  That's all I'm saying for now.

I know, lets get the Turks and the Kurds to ruin
their own economies fighting each other and our
economy won't suck so bad. 
  That is sooooo Bushian!
  Any other cats out there we can tail-tie over
a clothesline? Germany/France? Ethiopia/Somalia?
Venezuela/Argentina? DNC/DLC? Mom and dad???

PRIME ANARCHIST LOOKS AT COLOSPGS SEXUAL
HARRASSMENT(S) 1988-90.
  I honestly can't tell you which was a worse
place for women in the early '90s. Fort Carson 
or Airforce Academy. I've eaten dinner and dated 
women at both. Terribly, I say it's a toss-up. 
  Compare just the commissioned ranks and AFA is 
by far the worst. But factoring in the enlisteds 
at Fort Cartoon, and even stack Peterson AFB in 
with the Academy, it's about dead even. 
  Essentially, both suck.
  Real bad.
  Each woman can tell you she was abused worse
at her post than anywhere else imaginable. The
Pentagon should take note of THAT instead of
everything else they're obsessing over!

GEORGE BUSH'S PLANNED VICTORY SPEECH FOR '92. 
     NOW MORE APROPRIATE THAN EVER.
      typed in by Prime Anarchist

     My fellow Americans, I stand here before you proud to accept 
the honor and challenge of my second term as President of the 
greatest nation on earth and leader of the Free World. In the first 
four years, we completed our policy of containment, engineered a 
peaceful displacement of communism, and ushered in a New World
Order.
    In central america, we helped install fledgling democracies whose 
governments regularly hold free elections. In Panama, we rid the 
hemisphere of a dangerous demagogue; in Nicaragua, which fell under
the control of radical-nationalists, we restored democracy; and in 
nearby Cuba, we continue to work toward  neutralizing Fidel Castro.
    Around the globe, especially in Eastern Europe, we helped newly 
liberated peoples to see the benefits of the market and privatization. 
    In the Middle East I advanced the peace process by...

THE LAST HOUR IS FREE: Review Of An Art Museum

Milwaukee Art Museum is a bargain at even twice the price.

Thank God they finished this megaopadoppadooza before the 
economy tanked, eh?

I'm looking over the middle 1600's today for free.
I was in mainly to ask about what days/hours are
free to residents because I'd heard there was a 
day but wasn't sure if you needed a drivers licence
that said this town, or just this state. "Now," they
told me would be free. It turned out every day the
last hour they let anyone in. I don't even think they
need your drivers licence. But don't quote me on that
part, they may have let me through without just because
I looked and sounded like I was willing to show if asked.

So in the baroque section I saw the world's smallest
Matisse, and almost the smallest Renoir. Yes, I've
seen some tiny Renoirs in my life. In fact, I think
when you have someone score your initials into a grain
of rice, they have to send royalties to the Renoir 
family, that's how small he went way back when, but
I digress.

Next up is a normal sized Monet. (don't ask, I'm being
very subjective here. My opinion!) The one I'm looking
at is a good size, but that's all I can say about it 
really. I'm not appreciating this one. Sorry. I don't
have a good impression of the impressionists, let me
tell you. What, were they squinting? (I've always wanted
to type that!) Some Motherwells, yuck. Some of his 
worst if you ask me.

OK. I'm very catty today. I don't know why. I'm like
Morris The Cat, or Mikey, the Life Cereal boy. "He won't
eat it, he hates everything..."  

Lois Mailou Jones "Ascent of Ethiopia." 1932. 

This one's worth the highest admin price all by itself.
I'll stare at this one once or twice a month until I 
can get in to see Picasso's "Old Man And The Guitar"
in Chi-Town.

Roy Lichtenstein always GETS MY ATTENTION BECAUSE HIS
LARGEST BODY OF WORK was the year I was born. :)
We own "Crying Girl." I've seen similar pieces in books.
It's better in person, LET ME TELL YOU. Which is rare
for contemporaries in my country.

We own Warhol's "Mao???" 

Crazy, man. Thank you Mr. And Mrs. Krikorian!

My first chuckle today, ready?

Felix Gonzalez-Torres' Untitled (Veterans Day Sale) 1989
A stack of large pieces of clean white newsprint saying
only "Veterans Day Sale" centered in a tiny NYTimes font
on each page. I'm assuming they all say this, but I
don't dare lift one. He's got my sense of humor, so the
second page prolly says something like, "Mana, you gotta
get into everything, don't you?"

Pardon me, but I totally do NOT understand Jenny Holzer.
Don't get me wrong. I've seen a LOT of Holzers in my
life so far. But I seldom understand her. I "hear" her.
I just can't articulate any kind of an understanding. So
I guess you could say these speak to me, but I just don't
know what the heck they're "saying."

There's a yellow LED installation of hers here. I got
a kick out of the name brand of the light, "silent radio."
I'm not following the text really. I know I can remark
that it's moving fast enough to bother your brain and 
eyes.

She "appears" in David Robbins' "Talent," as does Robbins
himself so that just makes me think of some of Woody
Allen's laziest works. OK, that's very subjective too
but this whole collection so far seems just like so.

So there.

OK, I'm typing this in on the road. I wrote all these
notes on slips of paper in my pocket because they made
me check my daypack. And there were some other pages
with this one. I might not be able to find them. If 
I do they'll go after this paragraph. If I don't this
is all you get I guess. Half a review.

Neat.

- ANARCHISM (from the Greek an- and arche, contrary to authority),
- the name given to the principle or theory of life and conduct under
- which society is conceived without government -- harmony in such a
- society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience
- to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the
- various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted
- for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the
- satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of
- a civilized being.

GATT: Guitar Anarchists' Tricks of the Trade

OPEN LETTER TO DERRICK SILVA:
This morning I saw a pic of you on page 13 wearing
gauze gloves. Your caption says you're 22, your
hands were burned in the Warwick fire from pushing
the bar to the HandicappedExit which saved how
many lives??? and that you hope to play guitar 
again. 
  Now I don't mean this in any way to belittle 
your pain, and it's not even a "misery-loves-
company" scenario. I feel for you. This more a
challenge really and attempt toward empowerment.
Please continue playing guitar no matter how it
seems to sound at first. Sure it'll seem rude and
crude to start. But after all is said and done you
are going to own a historically unique sound and
style that no one could ever duplicate. I will
give you two examples and send you on your way.
  When I was about 15 I met a man summering up
the street from my boyhood home. He was on a
porch and from half a block away I could hear
a style oozing out of that home that Stevie
Ray Vaugn or Eddie Van Halen could NEVER capitalize
on. 
  He played a very old Gibson with BlackDiamond
strings but that wasn't where the sound was 
beginning really. He was missing his wedding-band
finger.
  THAT is where it all came from!
  In G, B, and C blues he was able to get 2-3
extra frets out of his pinky. In E and A he
got 4-5! 
  Now I would never cut off a finger just to get
his sound, maybe some will. I won't. I "go with
what god gives ya" so to speak. Au naturel, or
something. Let me tell you, I've tried replicating
this guy's sound with open tuning, slide, whammy,
different bridges, everything. No go. I still try
every once in a while to bring out a lick or two
that sounds half as exotic as those I remember
there. This recording-studio-reject from Camden,
NJ had something no one in the industry could
get. History.
  And lastly, just remember you still have hands.
Your thumbs (if you've still got 'em) will relearn
how to oppose your fingers, trust me.
  Victor Jara had his hands removed by machete in
front of thousands of Chilean fans in a soccer
stadium when Agosto Pinochet heeded Henry Kissinger's
greenlight and overthrew Salvador Allende. I'm told
the last words Jara heard before dying was a soldier
saying, "let's see you play NOW, monkeyboy."
  He will play no more.
  Physically anyways.
  Victor's late wife Joan gave one of his guitars to
an acquaintance of mine. A year ago last April I had
the good fortune of hearing that guitar get played by
both this acquaintance and by my friend David Rovics.
  I have to speak spiritually here of course, when I
say that so many decades later Victor Jara's hands 
are still "at work."
  Every disaster, every mistake, every mutation is 
proof once again that the guitar is way more than
the sum of its parts.
  Ooh, I ought to point out one extra example and
then close. 
  Black Sabbath's Toni Iommi. 
  After their first great metal album, you'll hear
something quite unique on that second and subsequent
albums. Toni had cut off 2 or 3 of his left hand 
fingers while chopping a winter-supply of wood. After
surgically reattaching them, his new sound was still
not satisfactory to him, so he taught himself to play
left-handed!
  Now perhaps "Black Sabbath" and "Wicked World" can't
be attributed to his accidentaly inherited sound, but
"Paranoid" and some of the others surely can.

e-maestro,
marco
