Dear marc frucht:
  Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding 
the School of the Americas. I appreciate having the 
benefit of your views on this matter.
  I am appalled at the very high number of SOA graduates 
who have been implicated in human rights abuses throughout 
Latin America, especially those responsible for the killings 
of the Jesuits in San Salvador, and others cited as human rights 
violators by the U.N. Truth Commission.
  I recognize that the Pentagon and others have argued that the SOA
plays an important role in professionalization of Latin American 
military leaders by providing training in human rights and in the 
appropriate role of the military vis-a-vis civilian governments in 
democratic societies. However, I believe the long record of abuses 
perpetrated by many of SOA's graduates undermines the strength 
of those arguments.  To the contrary, closing the SOA would be an 
important signal of the Administration's commitment to promoting 
human rights and democratic institutions throughout Latin America.
  As you may know, I am an original cosponsor of S. 908, a bill
which would require the Secretary of the Army to close the SOA.
This legislation is currently being considered by the Senate
Committee on Armed Services.  In addition, the FY 1998 Foreign
Operations Appropriations bill signed into law by the President
on November 26, 1997, mandates that no funding shall be provided
for military training at the SOA until the Secretary of Defense
certifies that certain requirements have been met.  First, it
must be consistent with the training provided to U.S. military
personnel. Second, specific guidelines regarding the selection
and admission of students to the SOA must be established.
Finally, the Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the
Committee on Appropriations detailing training activities and
providing an assessment of the performance of the SOA's 
1996 graduates.
  As I have stated previously, I believe we spend too much on 
international military aid, education and training, and I'll
continue to oppose wasteful and unnecessary spending in this
area which could better be used to meet pressing domestic needs.
  Again, thank you for contacting me.  I hope that you will
continue to keep me informed about matters that concern you.
  Sincerely,

Paul David Wellstone
United States Senator

Subject: School Of The Americas' 
As Ally, Not Foe, Of Drug Trade

The Pentagon continues to maintain the 
School of the Americas purportedly to fight 
drug production and trafficking in Latin America
There is mounting evidence, ironically, that the 
military in many Latin American countries is
deployed to PROTECT the drug trade.
  Recruits to the "school" at Ft. Benning, Ga., are 
allegedly arriving with bags of drug money to be 
laundered in the States.
  About the Rev. Roy Bourgeois himself: He is the 
antithesis of the angry fanatic railing against monstrous 
foreign policy. He made his statement, for which he served 
time in federal prison, and he remains a man of hope and joy.
  Thanks to Salter's article more of us will join Father Roy's 
campaign to close the School of the Americas. Bill and Henrietta 
Griffitts Martinez Regarding Stephanie Salter's article on the 
"School of Assassins / School of the Americas," and on the 
previous page the editorial, "Margaritas at the monastery" : 
Thank you for giving us worthwhile, meaningful and helpful 
articles.
  I have one question: Why is the School of the Americas so 
protected by our government?

So how do you deal with violence?  
Run from it? Ignore it?  
  Enlighten me on how to remove corrupt 
officials from office without violence. 
One of the key points of the Manifesto 
is that refusing to accept violence 
as a legitimate option ignores the 
example of our founding fathers.  
Corrupt officials do not die and 
go away.  
  They breed and contaminate.

100 LESS GREAT MOMENTS IN THE AMERICAN CENTURY.
   What's this obsession with greatness. And
why is appearing great more important than being
great to most?
   I leave out problems I have with calling ours
the American Century, (can you say ethnocentrism
for one?) there are too many. I will just mention
one more and move on with it. In the Guitar Anarchy
Tips #'s 5,6,7 8... cha cha cha! dept: I've seen
so many albums come out this decade saying so and
so sings or plays The Greatest Christmas Songs.
Well for next year, I'm publishing "Marco Sings and
Plays The Mediocre Christmas Songs."

   Anyhow, here's a list with little or no explanation
(BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO) of the top things I think 
happened from quite a while before I was born until 
"nowish."

THE DUMBEST AMERIKAN CENTURY AS TOLD BY ANARKIST PREIM
   These 69 are about all you need to know.
   68 things happened between 1900 and 1999. There's
liable to be 70 more in the next month and a half, but
for brevity sake we dare not dally over there.

                 ...explanation if need be...

12 89 United States each begin recovering from a great
             depression. The inventor of the slide rule
             warns of a millenium bug that will ruin
             things "sometime in the next 100 years or so."
11 00 "Fighting Bob" LaFollette elected governor of WI.
2 06 "The Jungle" the book.
11 06 Teddy Roosevelt visits Panama Canal
6 09 "The Melting Pot" the broadway play. 
5 11 Standard Oil Dilutes. Rockefellor can't make a buck
             unless he wants to borrow money from the 
             Gates's up on Oak Street.
8 12 Bull Moose Party. Makes Ross Perot look like... 
             ...well, not Nader/LaDuke

             an extra buck...
8 20 A woman gets to vote. Wow, what an idea.

8 35 Social Security Act "they'll stone ya..."
10 38 WOW. And not Womens Rasslin. Orson Welles
9 40 Ed Morrow. 
2 42 Rosie the Riveter. (women still don't conscript at
             18 like I did. "We" didn't do it. We just
             danced and beat the drum!)
6 44 D Day. Everyone's favorite day. I don't see what all
             the rave is. I mean they weren't the Beatles.
             Why were that many people on one beach???
             Ira Hayes storms Iwo Jima while Forrest 
             Kassanavoid takes Utah beach with Ike trying
             for Normandy. Russia spanks Hitler and Bill 
             Gates gives the army the credit. Kissinger
             agrees to loan ITT, Maggie Thatcher and 
             Gates a couple bucks.
8 45 US kills 138,000 nuking to save "millions." Never
             ...read any of Jesus "Sheep" parables, didja?
4 47 Jackie Robinson risks his life and death.
6 47 Groton Town built on scorched potatoe fields.

7 47 Oppenheimer says "Uranium Sucks"
7 47 CIA born
7 47 Kissinger born again.
11 48 Dewey thinks he won
9 52 Checkers. Almost more important than Woodstock. 
             But then you can't have one without the 
             other, heh?
6 53 Rosenbergs murdered. Like many of Hitler's victims 
             across the giant river, they were lower middle 
             class artists who loved each other very much
             and raised children with compassion 'til death.
5 54 Brown man (topeka?) v. Bored of White man.

             I just can't stand it...
6 56 Eisenhower signs to build roads for the military, then civs!
9 56 The big E followed by the little L. (elvis?)
9 57 Little Rock. National Guard, Regular Army AND state and
             local po-lice? Surprised you didn't send the 
             Peace Corps Volunteers. The police state grows
             up. We've been plagued ever since, no thanks 2
             William Jefferson Clinton. Fascist...
7 59 Nikita wallops Dick over the head with a Converse Allstar
5 60 FDA approves the pill, herpes, unbleached needles,
             and puts out a call for some good coke.
             George George, nowhere to be found. Where's
             that little sniffer when you need him?
5 60 U2 incident. Bono throws tantrum, rejects pablum. Mom at
             a loss. Calls Dr. Spock. Ritalin invented in 
             Westchester, Conn. by someone, I forgot.
             Not Eli Whitney...
7 60 To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie
9 60 Kennedy/Nixon pretend there's forum, debate, democracy 
             and issues.
1 61 Kennedy says in 1300 words or less what his quest for
             struggle against common enemies will consist
             of. Overcoming tyranny, poverty, disease and
             war? Watch your back: Dallas 1300 hours! Who knew...
2 62 John Glenn snubbed. Whines all the way into gerentology.
10 62 Kruchev, Nixon and Castro fight over Monica 
             Lewinski's dad's cigar. Fancy that, they
             didn't know it was just bubble gum. Neither
             did Monica.
6 63 Governor Wallace uses the 'N' word publicly. "Nigger," in
             case you didn't know. No one kicks him. Shame.
8 63 MLK's famous "I have a dream" speech. "No Dick;
             You can't deport him. He was born here."
8 63 Medgar Evers, Bob Dylan, Quarter Million, DC. 
             Kissinger to Nixon: "No, you can't deport
             him, he's Jewish. They'll nuke us.
11 63 Kennedy killed. Kissinger laughs at a Lenny Bruce joke.
             Or was that Lenny Bruce killed, Kennedy laughs
             at Kissinger, I don't remember.

3 81 With just 4 words, Hollywood henchman R Reagan
             pulls off the largest newsroom coup in

             sends almost every legitimate news organ
             including radio and especially TV so far
             to the right their butts hurt. Dittoheads
             from sea to shining sea still try to 
             abuse that phrase to this day.
7 87 Oliver North subpeona'd. Edwin Meese spends three days 
             straight trying to erase every single e-mail in 
             the White House. His ISP turns over duplicates of
             all the ones between him, Reagan and Noriega. 
             Meese turns state and gets a cushy job in a midwest 
             suburb with a new wife and a new dog. Or was that a 
             new dog and a new... (wag checkers?)
89ish, 90ish. Rome vs. Dade. It's all a blurr to me. Noriega

             his mind, we lose our freedom, (have you seen spot?)

4 92 Clinton has sax with MTV. Youth ask him, if elected...

3 95 Oklahoma City bombing. Gov't tries desperately to
             paint it as not right wing terrorism
11 99 School of the Americas closes its doors. Clinton gives famous
             speech releasing Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal
             saying our people will never again support death squads,
             paramilitaries, assassinations, election fraud and verbal

"You are about to be told one more time that you are 
America’s most valuable natural resource. Have you 
seen what they do to valuable natural resources? 
Have you seen a strip mine? Have you seen a clearcut 
in the forest? Have you seen a polluted river? Don't 
ever let them call you a valuable natural resource. 
They're going to strip mine your soul. They're going 
to clearcut your best thoughts for the sake of profit, 
unless you learn to resist. Because the profit system 
follows the path of least resistance and following 
the path of least resistance is what makes a river 
crooked ... make a break for it kids, flee to the
wilderness the one within if you can find it."

As is the traduccion, (sic.) we end with a
homemade poem.
...this one's called Usury: American Style!

If you pay full price
Even when you can't
"Afford" to - you
Aren't paying as much 
As one who deals.

If you give away
Without looking back
At a loss - you'll get back
More than one who
Steals.
