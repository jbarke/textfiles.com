FLASH! PRIME ANARCHIST PARDONS JOE CAMEL
(PAWN) - GREEN BAY - Film At Eleven.

Hi, I'm prime anarchist and we're changing the order 
around a little. No, no special reason. Just that we 
haven't done that in a long time. Today's zine goes:

1) Lettuce
2) NUMBuce
3) Columnis
4) EverythingElsis.

Enjoy,
prime

"One of the Creators blessings"
At the end of our time here 
We all get to finally breathe out

A-ho !
Bro Nappyhead


Hey Marco,
   Been a real long time since I've submitted anything to ATI....

   What's this deal with Clinton maybe running for President in 
   France?
   I'd hate to see that happen. 8 years of Slick Willie killed 
   this    country. I'm just waiting to see what the Dubya 
   does....
   Clinton should be thrown in jail for the Monica Lewinsky 
   investigation. 4+ million dollars to investigate a bimbo 
   who gave Clinton a blowjob. That and millions spent to 
   find out why ketchup comes out of the bottle so slow. 
   America's tax dollars hard at work. 
   Don'tcha just LOVE it?

   Anyway, the question for this issue is:

   Has anyone seen or heard from Ground Zero?

   All accounts, email and web pages are gone 
   (except for one)
   There are several possible theories....
   Kidnapped by aliens?
   Nah.....
   Whisked away in a black helicopter never to surf 
   the net again?
   Maybe......
   Dead?
   I certainly hope not......
   Witness Protection program?
   Possibly.....
   Fled the country?
   Definately not.....
   Leader of a right wing militia group hiding 
   in the mountains?
   We may never know.....

   More stuff:

   What's so new about the "New Millenium" anyway?
   Sure seems a lot like the old one.
   The almighty dollar still controls the masses.
   The cost of electricity jumps from $35 to over 
   $300 a megawatt hour and the Dubya doesn't want 
   to get involved. Enron must be laughing all the way 
   to the bank and then some.
   People are moving out of California because they can't 
   afford to live there anymore. Would you pay $140+ a month 
   for electricity?

News from my neck of the woods:

Some dumb bureaucrat wanted to repeal I-695, the $30 
car tab bill that Tim I-Man (sp?) managed to get on 
the November ballot. She said "People should pay $75 
or $100 for car tabs."
  Who is she to decide what people should pay for car 
tabs? I wish for the life of me I could remember her name....
  Some people were paying $200 a year for car tabs. Fortunately, 
Gov. Gary Locke was smart and said car tabs should stay at $30. 
  Why isn't gasoline a nickel a gallon anymore?
  Because corporations are greedy and the consumer pays without 
question. I wonder when America will finally say, enough is enough.

   Gotta love CNN's new infoline.....

"You're tuned to CNN Headline News, an AOL-Time Warner Company"

   Isn't it bad enough AOL flooded the planet with millions 
   of disks and CD's? That crap won't degrade in landfills 
   for the next few millenia not to mention the fact their 
   software tends to mess up almost every computer it's 
   installed on. I almost hate having to fix machines AOL 
   messes up.

Some poetry:

   Some time ago, when I was young
   I knew a friend, whos time had come
   To leave this Earth, for a better place
   No longer caressed, by life's embrace
   Maybe things are better there than here
   But still I shed, a silent tear
   What the future holds, I do not know....
   But towards my time, I slowly go.
   From my beginning, to my end....
   I will always, remember my friend....

   --Deeply Shrouded And Quiet 

And finally....a joke that can be laid to rest.....

FLIM-FLAMMYS: A Prime Anarchist Review of the Grammys.
  21feb01. Green Bay, Wisconsin

[DISCLAIMER: this was previously published in ati 264.2 
(midweek crisis.) I've you've already been through all 
this, feel free to scroll on past it. =))]

Yo.
  Yo, Ingrid Washinawatok is dead, Abbie Hoffman is gone,
Leonard Peltier is still unfree.
  Live, sort of, [on the CNNsorship delay] from Staples 
Center, the theatre that looks like a big old stuffed red 
and white aspirin, it's the 43rd annual FlimFlammy awards;
and why, you ask, do I like watching them on GE-TV rather
than in Radio City MusicHall, Staples or the Baghdad Hilton?
  Because here, I can wear my blue hoodie. That's why!
  I might oughta say a quick aside: one day before the
FlimFlammys, 1 billion dollars offered out of court? Napster?
What's THAT say???
  OK.
  Hey, since when are the FlimFlammys on CBS? Last year was
Staples, but it was still on GE-NBC, wasn't it? Not Westinghaus,
right?
  [SCRATCH HEAD]
  Was I asleep?? Hey, Mister DJ.
  OK, Madonna thinks she's Clive Davis meets Ronald Reagan or
something, huh? So I'm still buggin' about this NBC-c-c-C-CBS
merger, friendly agreement thingie. I guess I shoulda called 
it each time they went back and forth between LA and NYC, huh?
  [CURTSEY]
  NBC, leaving NYC for good. Soon come - mark my words peeps.
Remember when Letterman said he'd never leave New York OR NBC?
Yeah right. Promise me another. Oh well, NARAS' loss, not NY's!
  "I feel your scorn, and I accept it," said John Stuart.
OK, so Carson Daly makes up the 3rd blueman in that dorky
abuse of avant gardism, right?
  Of course NSync is Few Man Group.
  OK, Stuart, what words are you going to NOT use? Are you 
ready? Seconds delay and the big button. You are watching,
CNNsorship Central. Fun, isn't it. Really. Are Stuart and 
Bill Clinton related? I swear.
  Heather Locklear and Kid Rock, yeah. "Wow, check out this 
teleprompter." For that matter, are Kid Rock and Jesse Camp
from MTV related, or do they just pretend to do the same 
quality of heroin?
  It's Macy Gray's year. Boyee. Clive and Madonna's old money
must be finally taking hold.
  I can't wait until next year's FlimFlammys now that Marc Rice
is out. You ain't SEEN payola yet.
  And it's Devo for Target, Pampers, Windex. Yeah, how many 
paper products does it take to turn on a lightbulb?
  One, if you burn it hot enough. 

Yup, pass me the box of Payola crayons.

  "But when it comes to violence, there's no excuse."
  QUICK! SOMEONE TIE UP GEORGE W. BUSH, QUICK.

And from Cafe YabYum, Orlando Florida, it's LipSync. Oh, sorry.
I mean NLip. I mean, never mind. Who cares what their name is,
it's five young guys wearing dumb clothing, spending dumb money,
singing dumb songs, written by dumb ghost writers.
  The only trouble is -- you and I believe in them 1.3% more 
than we should!

  In a just world?

  SCENE: Every word I say is true
  [DROPS MIC] 
  [TURNS DOWNSTAGE]
  [SHOUTS] "This sucks. I can't sing this song, I can't feel it.
Buy me a song I can feel or get me off this stage. I won't sing
this, it sucks."

  Hmmm. Did everyone else see the two comedians shooting tshirts
out into the audience from a high-tech cannon? Looked like 
something Raytheon would have invented. Well before Dan Quayle 
handed out those 3500 pink slips.
  Hmm. Does anyone wonder what this Christmas' big hype product
is going to be?
  Um wait. Steely Dan. Um. Don't get me wrong. I've liked them
for many years. MANY YEARS. But man, I gotta ask this. Does 
anyone remember ever hearing them at all this year?
  At all? I mean I think I heard "Hey 19" a couple times in an
elevator in Chicago or something... What did I miss?
  Steely Dan beat Madonna AND Britney "Hitme" Spears? Umm. 
Clive? Madonna? What's up with that? 
  Destiny's Child, wow. The first real thing I've seen happen
across that stage so far. Why do I get the feeling they'd have 
all that same presence AND talent if you DIDN'T throw all that 
dumb money at them?
  WHY DO I GET THE SUDDEN HEAVY FEELING IN MY HEART THE THIRD REICH
IS BEHIND THE FLIM-FLAMMYS AWARDS' CALIFORNIA MOVE?
  And What's with Maya slouching like an inchworm as she presents?
I mean her neck's halfway down to her knees. I saw Macy Gray do it
too. What gives? Will people get flogged if they try to touch or 
adjust the microphone?
  The Folgers School Music grant, now there's a noble idea. Now you
too can write a song that kills someone in Colombia, Chiapas or
Costa Rica.

I hate to be the one who informs Paul Simon. Nope. I can't lie - 
I love being the one. Simon without the Garfunkle is like music 
without A through F.
  And what's this song. Should I even call it that? I guess I have
to, huh? OK. I won't go there. This band-in-a-box production, 
presentation, what do you call it? It's not really fair to make fun
of the old, because I'm going there too someday, but for Pete's sake
Paul.
  Buy a pulse, will you? Or at least buy something besides a new
bohemian. Paul Simon today is like a cross between Boy George, George
W, and George Burns. 
  http://www.josiethemovie.com
  Buy Folgers, Vaniqua, Viagra, Nads and Fuji film at a Target near
you. Have you tried Staples? Ladies and Gentlemen, we're about three
strip-malls away from full-on eco-anihilation and what, we're acting
like it's no big thing, ya'all. Who's up for a great steak dinner?
  Rainforest crunch. For real.
  John Stuart sucks his scarf down. Yeah, the man snarfed his scarf.
He did, he sucks. Did I say I think he's gotta be Bill Clinton's 
illegitimate son? Gotta be, I'm telling you. He's got Bill's ears,
his stance, his hands. Right down to the posture. He's got those
Harvard hands. You know, that class they'll teach you at Harvard,
Hollywood, or your house for that matter. They can make ANYONE a
president. Or just look like one. Just hold your hand like this,
and move it like so. Now do this. There, now get out there and
imagine them all in their underwear.
  Faith Hill, be a boob or just act like one. Can you say, "tall
blonde, badly dressed StepNFetchit?" Sure, I knew you could.
And how come they panned the camera to Tim McGraw all of a... Oh
yeah. That's right. Biggest music merger since Napster and old
Bertlesmann pooled their half a billion each or so last night.
  
  Bono.

Bono is so out of it he's lost sight of who HE is even. His very
own astute observations. And here he is. Hmmm. What's next a page
three paid letter explaining that he recognizes that netaid.com
+ napster + NARAS = 666 ?  You participated hoping you can change
it from within?
  Bono, this isn't a slam, I mean this as the most constructive
criticism I can ever possibly muster up for someone who used to
be such a hero of mine. 

You care so
much
you do so
little
you earn so
much
you mean so
little

So, what's behind the gilded curtain that makes you forget you're 
you?

It's a beautiful day, can you feel it?

The 43rd annual devo for coke, bic lighters, pringles, iams, 
heinekin and hippies and you can buy it at target.

I must say I think I've knowingly heard U2's "Beautiful Day at
least three times as often as the Steely Dan song.
  Wait, Bono's assistant just mentioned Jubilee 2000. I take back
everything I said...

And now the Dutchess of York for the best weight loss program
ever designed. Air Force sorti's over the no-fly zone?

John Stuart said saran wrap, he said saran wrap, he said saran 
wrap. Wow. Moby for Blue Man Croup. And what's this Jill Scott
playing air guitar to the gospel medley vulcan music meld from
hell?
  And here's BonJovi's Richie Sambora for buying your way out 
of Boston.
  [VOICEOVER] July 4, 1987. The stage dive is invented. July
5? Heinekin usurped it, along with the bic lighter, the peace
sign and the hippy. 

  Eminem and Elton. Wait a minute. History repeats itself. Isn't
this Louis Farakhan doing dueling violins with that Jewish guy
after all his politically incorrect antisemitic comments?
  Nneena Freelon and Take 6? Now that was real. OK. Cool. Macy
Gray's got it going on. I had a feeling she'd have it no other
way. What's with all the hairdos, though. That was wack. Those 
hippy paisleys on the overhead projector brought to you by 
Target, like Staples but with some more variety. Pink Hair
Group. And Heinekin, it's all about the Germans buying 
Napster. Ouch. Did I say that?
  Dumb money and smart bombs. Dead civilians and non-combatants.
And singing, "happy days are hear again, now the skies are hazy
shade of winter for the rest of your unborn and unnamed kids'
lives. 
  Hey Christina, do yourself a favor next year. Less meth, less
heroin and less spanish. And more weight. Eat some starch or
something. You make Kate Moss look fat. Mi Reflejo? Good try
girl. You know $4,000 worth of fonetiks books could never get
you dominating the Latin charts. You're about as out-of-your-
league as when Billy Joel said he'd be back with classical 
piano. How long has it been now? How long is never? Sorry
Billy, sorry Christina. Maybe if you went and teamed up with
Christina Aguilar you could pull it off.
  You could have beaten Oscar De La Hoya and his BeeGees song,
but you'd a never gotten past Shakira, sorry to inform you.
When SHE says, "you guys," it really has meaning. And she only
says it once. "And of course my country, like always. Everything
I do goes to them, is dedicated to them. My country Colombia,
that in spite of our tough reality, we keep our spirit joyful,
and alive. Thank you so much, and. I'm so happy, my God. Yeah,
Que vivo columbia."
  Rage Against the Machine won best hard rock performance with
"Guerilla Radio."

  AOL keyword: apartheid.

  "C Major because D flat would suck." Umm. Good try, Stuart.
I know what you were trying for. Almost. No really. Stay with
comedy.
  Please.
  Next?

  And now a little bit of Chopin played live so as to help 
perpetuate this gentle little myth, (BIG LIE, BIG LIE, BIG
LIE. LIKE HITLER'S BIG LIE.) 
          ----this gentle myth that music is what we're 
about.

  "After years of convincing, the Grammys are acknowleging for
the first time, native american music. The original roots music,"
said Robbie Robertson, "of this continent. And we haven't got
freedom for Leonard Peltier yet. Maybe he's not Marc Rich enough,
but we are getting our first grammy, and Val, [Kilmer] for this 
we are grateful."
  Tom Bee and Douglas Spotted Eagle won the first grammy in a
native american music category ever, for their production of 
Albuquerque's Gathering of Nations PowWow.
  "First and foremost I'd like to give all the honor and all 
the glory to the greatest warrior, my lord and savior Jesus
Christ." Somehow that seems unpretentious, unscripted and 
real, hearing that come from Tom Bee. I can hear that from
him, sounds so much more real than anything George W. Bush
has ever uttered in his slimy, propped up contrived life.
Or most of you for that matter, if I can be so candid.

  Faith Hill - I guess it's ok to fall out of your shirt in your
seat, onstage singing, and in video, but never, never, never.
Never while walking the stairs up to the stage. Cover your you
know whats with your award or something. Hold your shirt together
til you get up there. Go.
            long....
       long....
    long....
  long....
 long...
editorial from the NARAS people. We're right back to "race-records"
days, now aren't we?
  Ladies and Gendarmes, without seven of his most important words, 
here's Eminem.

  Target, up yours.
  It happens at the Hilton. Tracers, look, in the sky, it's
a lazer, it's a fazer, it's bombings! Light up the sky, at
the Hilton. The Baghdad Hilton. 
  And don't forget, NARAS. Spelled backwards, you're nothing
but saran wrap.
  Happy mining. 
  May you someday realize music is not for conquest, 
ownership or private stock,
marco
the prime anarchist





JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
* Tommy Thompson (Health and Human Services): former
governor of Wisconsin whose major contributors were 
HMOs, hospital chains, nursing homes, prisons, clinics, 
doctors and insurance companies. Phillip Morris gave him 
$72,000 in campaign contributions.

[two extra things non-wisconsinites should know 
about Thompson: 1) it is uncertain who will spend 
less time in DC with him, his wife or a girlfriend.
2) He does NOT (I repeat: N O T ) own the 
world's largest collection of toupes.]



POETRY SUBMISSION
Hope this is to your liking...

"Jetsam"
("And presently a severe storm came up on the sea, 
so that the ship was hidden by the waves; but He 
lay sleeping." Matthew 8:24)

When I invited You along for the ride
I expected easy sailing.
When I let You borrow my life I expected
sails full of Windy purpose.
I expected docks in peaceful harbors and
Mediterranean warmth in receptive bays.

I’ve been in storms before You boarded My
life and insisted on taking the helm.
I’ve climbed myself out of craggy wrecks
leaving flotsam bobbing behind me.

But now You sleep while I strain against
the torrent and anger,
now you rest while I wake in light or dark
with plans of escape or escapade from danger.

This severity has dashed my courage upon the rocks,
this gale has torn my resolve in tatters,
these waves have hidden me from onshore help and
I fear my
loss of hope more than
loss of life.

While You sleep, I wake.

Would you bid me to leave my rescue and join Your rest?
Would I jettison personal cargo to lay my head upon Your breast?
In the storm?
Hidden from hope?

finding His rest,
mark p.
