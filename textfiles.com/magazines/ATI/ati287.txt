                ...        Issue # 287    Aug-17-2001
Hello,
  Shouts and greets from the text editor of my brand new
spiffy linux box. It took me seven failures of everything 
from freeBSD, to redHats 6.0, 6.2 and even redhat 4.5 before 
finally seeing some success with Caldera 2.3
  I still use one win95 box which I'll keep maintaining for a
time til I've hunted down each of the programs I regularly use
and come up with a decent linux equivalent. That may take a 
couple weeks or a month or so I'll bet.
  And then I'll finally be free. :)
  So it's Friday, August what, the 17th? I'd always hoped to
have *nix running on at least one box by Dec99. But I guess 
I missed it by a couple little years, eh? Oh well.
  Should I columnize some, even though I'll be writing something
up about webzine.ws this week? Hmmm. OK. But I'll make it short.
````````````````YOU'VE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Best Buy owns Sam Goody as of last November. Wish I knew that
when I went and bought my newest Luckyboys CD, "Throwing The
Game." I was making Best Buy my last resort as I checked which
stores might have it. I struck out at a couple spots, they'd 
never even heard of them yet, and one place (we won't mention 
any names, right Tom?) doesn't have copies I guess, because he 
doesn't like them very much. We've tried to get them hired
back here as headliners at least 5 other times since they'd 
been to town warming up Little Blue Crunchy Things with 
Mustard Plug. But nogo. "Nah, I just don't like 'em much," 
is all we'd get. Oh well. His loss, not ours really. We're
willing to travel for 'em.
  So I end up buying it in SamGoody, thinking ok, at least it 
wasn't Best Buy. Well, little did I know. Right? Turns out
just like buying Keystone beer because you're boycotting Coors.
What??? Adolf Coors owns Keystone too? Yupper.
  OK, how did I find out? Well, I go into SamGoody yesterday
thinking I'd just see how many Luckyboys CD's there are and
ask if there's someone local I could ask about moving them
somewhere prominent and thinking up some extra display ideas
since their first MTV video is going to hit in a couple days
and their second single got released the other day.
  Well, the woman I speak with tells me she'll ask the district
supervisor if they can maybe use one of the poles that holds
the ceiling up because they contain the only square inches that
aren't controlled by corporate HQ. "SamGoody's corporate?" I
ask. "No, Best Buy," Double-Take. "Wha??" I say, "Yup, bought
us out last November."
"Yikes," I ask her. "Didn't SamGoody just buy out MusicLand
and a bunch of other small music chains the year before that?"
"Longer ago than they were willing to tell us," was all she'd
say. Not into telling me exact dates or particulars or anything.
  So Best Buy now owns almost every record store left in the
continental United States. Perhaps the whole world soon, eh?
  I'll end this column saying that just really sucks.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY WEBZINE.WS

Holy wah! I had such a great time in the CBGB's
Gallery attending nyc's first Webzine conference.
I'll write up some of my observations and feelings
here.
  Wow, many people were able to write about Webzine2001
right after the smoke settled. I'm glad. It was good to
read many of the reflections. I wish I was able to 
write something up just minutes after the event. Hell,
I shoulda written a gonzo piece while sleeping in Penn
station between Zamboni cleanings, maybe. But I decided 
to wait because I felt Webzine deserves so much more, so 
much better. Fear not, I journalled a lot so there'll be 
plenty to "collate," or move around into this little ditty 
about the con. Hmmm. Maybe I'll go really long and need to 
continue it in 3 or 4 issues like some of our other 
"trilogies." 
  Hehehehe. I see Aaron's most recent trilogy is going
to finish up at 4 pieces. "Part four of this trilogy,"
way to go. Nothing wrong with that, trust me, it's quite
precedented. Look it up yourself. Some of your favorite
trilogies are 4, 5 and sometimes even 9 stories long,
huh?
  Yup, so webzine, what can I say about WZ2001NYC besides
that Michael Moore was his great usual self, that the
guy from http://www.fuckedcompany.com gave great panel,
that the guy who attacked staples school in western
connecticut was fun to listen to. Well, read on, and
you'll see. 
  Everyone's heard of SOHO, how come NOHO isn't a house-
hold word like Soho??? I guess because they don't have
their "woody allen."
  So how did I get involved with webzine in the first
place? Well it goes back to '98 or so when the first
cons in San Francisco were happening. I couldn't 
afford to travel there and back once a year so I find
myself wanting to help out as much behind the scenes 
year round well, why? Mostly just because I'm "down 
with all that."
  I'm leaving some of these notes very raw from my
journals because they lose too much good edge the
minute I start editing myself. :) 
  "You know the drill..."
  Scarleteen. Sysop said web porn used to be male
dominated for the longest time. Now it's 52% women
run. Hmmmm. 
  Met Ryan, met Dru, met Michael Moore again met a
ton of other great people I don't remember the names
of.
  "Many foreigners hate Americans for the exact 
reasons most Americans have said they loathe me."

  ...I notice I'm still unwinding from my NY trip for
webzine.ws. Wow. It really effected me. Left quite an 
impression. Neat.
  Aug 31, Guild will close down their Westerly, RI 
plant. Fender, which bought them in 1995 will move
all ops to its manufacturing HQs in Corona, Calif.
  "The move will allow the company to 'streamline' its
production of the Guild guitars."
  Gee, streamlined. Where have I heard that before???
Lately, I guess the question is where HAVEN'T I heard
it, eh?
  I'll end this puppy here giving a quick shoutout to
Srini. The "Go work on your website" sticker is now
placed prominently on the case to my Epiphone.

" and I'd like to do more about it than "make sure 
ALL coffee famers are paid $1.26 per lb.!!" "
  you just did.  also maybe you can open peoples eyes 
to the structures of colonialism who aren't even aware 
that colonialism even exists. believe it or not those 
people do exist.  not everyone was born knowing the
world is fucked up.
  maybe we get  a hint the first time someone yells at 
us? but in the meantime doesn't somebody have to raise 
coffee prices? isn't simply ending suffering in itself 
a good thing?
  maybe i don't have the time or the patients or the 
connections to do that, but somebody's got to.

Hey,  ATI is a *great* zine.
  I have been reading it for sometime and feel
that I may have something that I would hope could 
spark your interest.  My friend Jerome (sk8) was 
arrested while employed at Los Alamos National
Labratories in January of this year.
  A website has been setup at 
               http://www.freesk8.org 
                              and I encourage you to 
take a look.  As of now the case is very shady.  The 
FBI has been trying to use hackers as scapegoats ever 
since the giant evolutionary leaps that the PC has 
contributed.  After Hoover met his demise, they have 
been trying to find a way to secure a positive public 
image.  It seems very unlikely that anything unique 
will come from the case after many previous situations 
very similiar have been prosecuted.  I encourage you 
to watch how the new director of the FBI (Mueller) 
will handle this especially since he was the one that 
setup the so called "Cyber Crime Units" sometime ago.
  He would hate to lose his first cybercrime case with 
the units that he himself setup.  Just think of how 
the public would view his senate confirmation after 
that!?  
  hah. Regardless, I want to spread the word about 
Jerome in hopes that something positive may come out 
of the FBI's relentless scrutanizing of the online
underground community. Thanks, raganr0x

Well, I got the deal!  It's official.  And I want to tell
you a little about it, before I give you the link to pick 
up the full story.
  You know, when people come to me with the newest marketing 
software out there, I tell them, "Technology can never make 
up for a lack of marketing know-how."  Don't you agree with 
this statement?

  {ed note: not really. }

living today that has a success record at...
  Not easy to do!
  Not only that, but he helped develop some of the most wildly 
successful advertising campaigns in history
- The Marlboro Man
- Pillsbury Dough Boy
- Charlie the Tuna
- The Jolly Green Giant
- Tony the Tiger
And, let's not forget the world famous "Fly the friendly skies" 
tagline of United Airlines.
  Yesterday, I made special arrangements for you to personally 
meet this man and "pick his brain" for an entire day!...

THERE AND BACK   by Aaron Kreider
  (CON'T From Last Issue)

[ed note: part IV of this trilogy. :)]

...illegal, but tolerated. The only main rule was that I wasn't allowed to
solicit people for money (a local city rule). He was somewhat puzzled that
I was hitchhiking as he was used to seeing homeless people doing it. There
was a lot of traffic, though half of the trucks took another exit where
they would be unlikely to stop for me. I guess that most of the car traffic
was local, as I saw a lot of Iowa license plates. I didn't see a single
Indiana plate on a car. So I hitched through the night, ate two bags of
potato chips (99 cents each for about 90 grams), a 20 oz pepsi and 20 oz
coke for caffeine, and a "super biggie" order of fries (hope they're
vegetarian, they weren't from McD). Overall on this trip I probably lost
several pounds as I had brought a lot of snack food (granola, dried fruit
and nuts), but I wasn't eating that much. I took some break time, say
around 3am, to sit down, eat and drink and read the 20th anniversary Earth
First! Journal. There wasn't any good place to crash so I stayed awake the
entire time. I should have been ok, since I'd slept until early afternoon
the day before, but perhaps it wasn't good sleep as I was extremely tired.
In the morning, I was even nodding off when I'd sit-down or even standing
up trying to hitch a ride. Maybe I should have drank more caffeine? What
made my failure to get a ride even worse, was that every couple hours a
Greyhound bus would arrive, either going to Chicago, New York, or Los
Angeles. So I knew that I could easily be on a bus and take that back home
to South Bend. The first time or two that I saw a bus, I optimistically
figured that I could get a ride back to South Bend faster than the bus -
since Greyhounds don't drive as fast and I expected to get a direct ride
from a truck so I wouldn't have to wait at the Chicago station for the
South Bend bus. I took a short break from hitching when it started to rain
as a storm passed through.
Eventually, around early afternoon (2-3pm) I decided that I was too tired
to continue hitching. By this time, I was possibly not the most
friendly-looking hitchhiker as I was getting madder and more frustrated as
time passed, though I make an effort to smile at times. I think making a
sign listing how long you'd been trying to get a ride might be a good idea
to negate the free-rider problem, as everyone assumes that someone else
will pickup the hitchhiker. So you could cross out the number of hours
you've been there, or even write "Stuck Here since 3pm".  During all this
time at Iowa 80 I switched between using my "EAST I-80" and "SOUTH BEND"
signs. At first I was using the South Bend one, but when I later decided
that I'd accept a ride to Chicago I went with the EAST I-80 one. So I got
tired and decided to take the bus. It wasn't a regular stop, but the driver
figured out how much it would cost to go to Chicago by calling the
Greyhound number (around 33$). Since I wanted to go all the way to South
Bend, he asked for a $25 deposit and then we'd get a ticket at the next
station which was Chicago.
I had two seats and slept easily on the bus. By now I could have slept on a
concrete floor. In Chicago, I got my bag and waited around a bit for the
bus driver. But he'd disappeared, so I looked for him in the station, but
didn't find him. Rather than try to navigate the Greyhound chaotic
bureaucracy and get a ticket to South Bend, I decided that I'd just go take
the South Shore commuter train instead since it was more comfortable,
cheaper, and likely faster. So I don't know if my driver kept the money or
gave it to Greyhound. While I was in the Chicago Greyhound station (on my
way out), a young guy asked me for money to help pay for his ticket which
cost more than he'd been originally told. As I was pondering and somewhat
doubting his story, an elderly woman came up to us and exposed him since
she'd already promised to pay the extra money and here he was still asking
around! Even after this, she was still willing to give him the money(!!!),
but he refused and since he was caught in the act he walked away. The
problem with people making up these stories is that if someone actually had
a problem it would be very hard for them to get help. At least I have a
very hard time telling the difference. In this case, Greyhound messing up
the fare made sense since Greyhound often messes things up.
I left the bus station and walked about half an hour to the South Shore one
which I found without much trouble. Took the 5:10pm train ($9) to the South
Bend airport (note hitching would have been better since the interstate is
only a mile from my home), then caught the bus (75 cents) and transferred
downtown to take me home. I arrived home around 8:30pm. So the return trip
took three days and six hours.
Miles - On the Way There
140 - from I-70 to I-80
350 - Nebraska, west on I-80
400 - Wyoming, west on I-80
160 - north to Alpine
20 - from Alpine to campsite
à1070 miles
(2.33 days of hitching - 459 miles/day)
Miles - On the Way Back
200 - from Alpine to Ogden
70 - Ogden to Evanston
400 - Wyoming, east on I-80
450 - Nebraska, east on I-80
280 - to Iowa 80 truck stop, east on I-80
à 1400 miles
(3 days of hitching - 467 miles/day)
So I hitched for a total of 2470 miles. On average I traveled 460 miles per
day which was about the same as my first trip (where I averaged 500
miles/day), though this time I got significantly less sleep since I didn't
get to sleep in trucks. I also got really stuck twice. In comparison to
these two times, spending the night in North Dakota stuck in the Theodore
Roosevelt National Park (on my first trip) was nothing.
Apparently hitching is far easier in Europe. A lot of American truck
drivers would be willing to pick you up, but companies have rules against
it stemming from insurance reasons. So they're taking a significant risk,
unless perhaps they own their truck.
Overall I probably won't go on a long hitchhiking trip for a while. I think
shorter trips are fine, say one or two days where you can go without sleep.
But longer ones are draining. Being homeless isn't that fun, and if you're
going to pay $35 for a motel you might as well save money by taking and
sleeping on Greyhound. You definitely do meet fascinating people and it is
the most adventurous way I know to travel, but you know that, for instance,
when you start composing new verses to "The Bear Went Over the Mountain",
singing "500 bottles of soy milk on the wall" or decide to hitch-hike
standing on one foot - that there are more exciting things to do than stand
by the side of the road for ten hours. That's not to say that everyone
shouldn't try it at least once, especially males for whom it's less risky.
Hitchhiking is an ideal. I believe that people are good and by hitchhiking
hope to learn to trust and like people whom I'd never ever meet. I don't
think it should be too impossible to make hitching an effective form of
transportation. Everyone used to do it. My dad even hitched to his wedding.
Ideally hitchhiking is part, albeit a rather small part, of my radical
commitment to build a just society.
