Greetings and salivations.
I'm Prime Anarchist and here's the rant I attach
to this zine each week dealing with AMPs. Anarchy,
Music and Poetry as our main topics, and all things
in between. Some of the outskirts even. Right?
  Right.
  So New England went an entire hurricane season
without a single biggie-storm. Ne'r an H storm,
a G storm or even a D strom all year. Methinks we 
were "gone easy upon!"
  "All I want for Christmas is a president," is on
as hold music while I wait to talk to one of my
journalist friends at some daily paper. No offense
intended to the person who penned that parody, but
if you ask me, I want a whole lot more than that.
  I mean talk about asking for an unimportant gift.
I mean do you think Mother Earth gives three hoots
whether we get Gorge Bush or Albright Gore as our
next president? Both will hurt her. Both couldn't
care less about the environment.
  Does anyone really believe that one is going to
be worse than the other for the plight of the poor?
There's going to be a 20% increase in ugly grey 
blankets being distributed throughout our nation's
capitol every year for the next five no matter WHO
wins all 7 lawsuits pending.
  Do you for a single solitary moment think any
one administration is going to be better equipped
to handle the economic hard times ahead when we
begin figuring out how to go back "in budget" with
Iran/Contra, BCCI, S&L, Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia,
Hurricane Mitch, Donald Trump's bankruptcy proceedings,
and Tipper Gore's hangnail operation last Thursday???
  Do you? Do ya? Huh? Huh??? Huh, huh? Do you???
  The war on drugs is going to turn really (f)ugly
the moment Al Gore gets at the helm, both abroad AND
here in the Untied States. 
  And Bush would handle things better, because?
  Well? Do you get my point? We're about to have a
7-foot Christmas tree shoved up our butts so deeply
it'll stick out our ears or our eyesockets. Take your
pick. Gore or Bush. Which thousand pound gorilla do
YOU want humping YOU in a Wal-Mart parking lot? Choose
carefully now.
  6 lawsuits from now they're going to announce who
our president is going to be.
  For the 19th time!!! And I've figured something out.
Follow me on this one people, it's either going to be
Al Gore and his people including Monica Lewinski, er
uh, uh, I mean Joe Leiberman; or it's going to be George
"What-We-Worry?" Bush and his people including Nancy
Sinatra, John Gotti, Nancy Kissinger and some guy from-
Laramie-Wyoming-with-a-long-range-ballistic-missile-
sticking-its-tactical-nuclear-phallic-self-90-feet-
out-of-the-ground-with-red-and-green-blinking-lights-
atop-it named after him.
  Gore's people, or Bush's people. Let me be none-too-
equivocal here: which middle aged wealthy white racist
southern hick with an IQ just under his age who's the
son of a lifetime politician (can you say nepotism???)
would YOU prefer? We're going to get one of them, 
people. Brace yourselves. We haven't evolved to demand
"none of the above," in OUR nation yet.

     -=Prime=- Anarchist, and I said that.


123456789.........10.   10,9,8,7,6,5432......1!
No, not the selectric company (ibm (tm)), it's ATI.

And this is the #'s run for Thirst-day. N30. 2000.
The one year anniversary of WTO! The day an earthquake
greeted Mexico's new president, the day two schrapnel
bombs greeted Senator Paul Wellstone, (he lived) the
day people camped out dead-style in front of the Supreme
Court building for tickets. I need a miracle! The day
the mirth stood still. 120100

When are people going to began protesting the 
choping-down of all those "political-government 
Christmas trees" burn'em down! standing on their 
sacred government headquarters!

Hi Marc ,
Wow, quick response. ok.. 
well 112% profit for a loan that carrries 12% interest
<meaning ok?>
just because they can manipulate bank accounts with numbers.
It does explain why banks get wealthier and wealthier.
(Create "virtual money," and when its payed for then its 
"real" money, nice scheme eh? :)  ) Also how they crash. 
(when people take their money from the bank)
  I don't think , i can write a piece because :
I don't see myself as an anarchist. (To much alike 
groupsex to me.) I Read the ATI and a lot more 
publications to widen my horizon. (#5 needs input..)
  If you're interested, i will continue sending these, 
either by NN or direct as reply.
  btw.. real name (_______ is my internet(gaming) nickname) 
is _____, I use it all over the internet.. (icq, nttp, http, IRC)
It doesn't mean that i have "only" ONE nickname. 
  For the moment it services the purpose it was created for.

TO THE CITIZENS OF THE WHOLE KIT AND KABOODLE,
In light of your problems...
Please look up the word constitutional
in the dictionary... Rhymes with, smells
like?
...Also, please look up the words "feather-
duster, fuzzy math, and lock-box."
You've obviously lost your mandate, do
you want to lose your corporate charter
too???
  Wake up!
And for Judas' sake, man... Please tell us
who shot JR.

Re: The X-Fiels and SOA

I went to the SOA Watch vigil at Ft. Benning last year to protest the 
"School of Assassins." There was a guy there passing out fliers and
crazily screaming "Scully's sister was killed by the SOA!" He was
pretty rabid and people were scared of him but i was excited b/c 
there was another phile in the midst! Since no one else seems to 
be responding to you b/c there are a lot of misconceptions about 
the SOA and it is referenced so quickly on the eps, I will gladly
tell you where to find the mentions. I hope your intentions are
moral, like DD and CC who wrote the eps! I once found a site
that used TXF as a prop for the Chilean Nazi Party! Be careful!
#1- "They're cold blooded killers"- Byers
   "School of the Americas graduates." -Langly
    from Anasazi
#2- Skinner is talking about Louis Cara-something 
    (the guy who shot Melissa) to Scully.  He tells 
    her that he was a killing machine or something, 
    "a School of the Americas alumni" I'm pretty sure 
    its from from Paper Clip
>Can someone tell me which X-Files eps mention the School 
>of Americas or SOA, there is one that mentions the name 
>outright and another that mentions death squad training 
>at a school in Georgia with U.S. tax dollars.  I just 
>need the names of the eps.
>thank you for your help.

Peppersprayed For Christmas
To The Tune Of "I'm Getting Nothing For Christmas"
  Tepper/Bennett (c) 1955 
  new words by PAP - Prime Anarchist Productions
            [copyleft] (cl) 2000

I'm gettin' pepper sprayed for Christmas 
Georgie and Albert are mad.
I'm getting pepper sprayed for Christmas 
'Cause I ain't seen nuttin' but bad.

They infiltrated our whole group;
Somebody snitched on me.
All I did was hollar and whoop;
Somebody snitched on me.
I don't like cops morphin' into troops;
They get so cocky and act like poops;
I'm sure they didn't wanna be like that, oops;
Somebody snitched on me.

Oh, I'm gettin' pepper sprayed for Christmas 
Jeb Bush and Neil is mad.
I'm getting pepper sprayed for Christmas 
'Cause I ain't seen nuttin' but bad.

I put some KrazyGlue on WarBucks's chair
somebody snitched on me.
I pointed out arresting's just not fair
somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on top o' the ruins
Of multinational corporate doins,
Filled the streets with my own peeps -
somebody snitched on me.

Oh, I'm gettin' pepper sprayed for Christmas 
The Dow and the NASDAQ are mad.
I'm getting pepper sprayed for Christmas 
'Cause I ain't seen nuttin' but bad.

I won't be seeing Santa Claus;
Somebody snitched on me.
He won't come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me.
Next year I'll be here again;
We'll be twice as many and then
Even infiltrators can't stop us when;
Somebody snitches on me.

So you better be careful whoever you are
Pick which side of the street's for you,
And maybe you'll get peppersprayed too.

 Jeb’s defaulted loan from Broward Federal Savings and Loan in Sunrise,
 Florida transpired as follows.16  On February 1, 1985, Broward Federal
 loaned $4,565,000 to real estate developer J. Edward Houston, secured
 only by Houston’s personal guarantee.  The same day, a company headed
 by Houston turned around and loaned the same amount to a partnership of
 Jeb Bush and Miami real estate developer Armondo Codina for them to buy
 a five-story building in Miami’s financial district.

Litany of the Full Moon
  a poem by Rafael Jesús González

Mother of the eggs
in their shells -
        lull us.
Queen of the crystals
& of the mirrors -
        bewitch us.
Sister of the suns
of the south & the north -
        enlighten us.
Godmother of frost
& of jasmines -
        console us.
Mistress of the tides
& of the waves -
        remind us.
Goddaughter of the planets
& of the stars -
        guide us.
Shepherdess of the clouds
& of the mists -
        protect us.
Grandmother of the snowy sierras
& of the fevered mountains -
        heal us.
Wet-nurse of dreams
& of illusions -
        give us courage.
Bless us holy light
        of the night.

We hope: you

or c)will use it some.

And of course, we end with a poem.
Because after all is said and done, 
all we got left is myth and metaphor, 
huh?

A Poem for Muhammad al-Dura
[in English, for a reason]

sent in by secret squirrel

Aaaakh, ya M'hammad...
How could they do that to you?
I could not bear to see the pictures
Of your final moments of terror

And when the brave ambulance men came to try to help you
They shot and killed one of them too

I have no words to express
My revulsion
My bitterness
My deep, deep sadness

Despite the world's best propaganda,
The undeniable disparity cannot be blurred 
Between your poor, but noble, people whose human rights have been violated
For so many decades
And the well-armed, well-fed, divinely arrogant zealots
In their 'NY Yankees' baseball caps
So pampered and protected by their American lackeys
In the face of universal condemnation (for so many decades)
Goliath cannot masquerade as David any longer
No, you don't fool me

A child's life should be more precious
It is more precious, damn you!

How could you shoot him, that little boy?
How can anyone console his poor father and mother?
Chosen by the devil you must be
Where is the shame that should consume your society?
His life was no less sacred than one of your own

The brutal state of Israel, the biggest terrorist of all,
Has yet to account for its record of racist evil
Inflicting so much suffering upon so many families, daily now... 
For half a century
Instead, it continues to gloat as the favorite brat
Of the side with the big guns
(for the time being...)

They deleted your life, ya M'hammad
And I can only offer you these tears
