who lost fourteen hundred pounds eating nothing but
HUNZA DIET BREAD seventeen times a day is a volunteer

     Welcome to ATI313. You might think
   our opening logo looks a bit different.     23ish Apr.
       You're right.  We're just on              2002
         a tight budget this week.

TIE GOES TO THE REPUBLICRATS

Working class people of the world unite. They're both messing
with us.
  Bush and Gore both won. And here I'll show you why.
  War in the middle east serves Cheney and Bush -- but
the Anthraxings that came along with it serves Lieberman
while Colombia mostly serves Gore.
  Why would Gore concede when he clearly felt he won? Bush
showed him a win-win situation that was better by far than
just being president. Hahahaha. Bush not only got over on
all the amerikan people, he got over on a man with twice 
the IQ of he.
  WTC? Brings all four of them to the feeding trough when
you really think about it. A bi-partisan wet-dream.
  Oh, and hey Catholics, I hope I'm speaking merely figuratively
here, I fear I'm not. 
  Bush killed an ArchBishop just especially for Al Gore.
  "Thanks for dropping all your law suits. They surely would
have brought my financial ruin."
  Why did democrans and republicats attack the Green Party so
venemously when it really affected nothing in outcome? They
needed everyone fully distracted, looking the other way if
we were going to miss all this.
___________You know, there's something_____________
  Really prurient about watching Danny Bonaduce, Dick Clark
and {who's this other guy???} playing with Barbie dolls in
front of a studio audience. A show called "The Other Half."
  Apparently Emmy's got bigger hips among other things than
Barbie. Seperate company? Subsidiary? Not entirely sure. 
Bonaduce in his life-long attempt to have the same quick
timing with one-liners as when he was a little kid strumming
a bass guitar, (yeah, we're trying to be Cassidy's dad, aren't 
we all?) blurts out "Barbie got back."
  He also made some comment about "should the DeBeers cartel
continue trusting people like Winona Ryder." hmmm. Keep in mind, 
he also ran with a comment a woman in the studio audience made
about Barbie, if she were a real woman, would have to walk on
hands and knees because of her messed up proportions. "Hoo hoo,
you know I'd love it if..." Also keep in mind the next guest
on this show is going to be Lorena Bobbit. Or is it going to
be that next woman who married him after he left Lorena for
Mike Tyson? 
  I channel surfed away, so can't tell you what happened next.
But I want to say I feel that Bonaduce's sexist comments, or 
Emmy doll's fishnet stockings are only so obscene. What's icky
is going to be the billions of dollars _____________ [insert
utility company who owns defense contractors and TV channels
here] is spending on this new show in their desperate and
pathetic attempt to manipulate your mind.
________Nepotism alert_______________ 
  Dottie Brewer, she's the one who married John Wayne Bobbit
after "the incident." Is she related to Theresa Brewer?
___________________Enough Already______________
  3 Israelis died today. 2 or 4 depending on which news service
you look at until they all have a chance to watch each other
and line themselves up with something that sounds true, and
balanced.
  Sometime in the next 10-20 hours there are going to be a
dozen or two dead Palestinian human beings. Yes, at the hands
of helicopters made in Connecticut, tanks and tractors made
in Kansas and Minnesota and M16A1 assault rifles made by the
same people who brought us the Barbie doll!
  Whatever moment the truth is clear I am going to add up 
the dead humans from both sides and report that __ semites
are dead at _suchandsuch_ a time in continued warfare egged
on by Washington DC directly and Fort Benning School Of Americas
indirectly. 
  If you need to kill me for this, go ahead.
  If you have to sick David Horowitz and Christopher Hitchens
on me for months at a time, have at it. Knock yourself out.
  If you must try to flood this newswire article off the 
front page by posting 45 useless texts drafted right up in
Herndon, VA go for it, because you know what?
  The truth will NOT be silenced. Put off for decades at a time
maybe -- but never silenced.
  I've had enough.
____________thank yous to Macy's for clothing and__________
__________Peter Frampton____________ for makeup and hair______
  You people have been playing Hatfields/McCoys in Israel since
well before I made it to nursery school, and for what. So Rockefeller
Brzezinski and Kissinger can make billions act like trillions?
  Fuck you.
  Ya Basta!
  I will NOT ALLOW you to continue putting dead middle class and
poor human beings on a bell-shaped curve. Your complicity, silence
or apathy (depending on who you are reading this) is corrupt, 
immoral and unjust, is now predictable in its bad form.
  It is time to discuss linkage. We will save lives minute by
minute in our very discussions I think. WE MUST! Palestine, 
Iraq, Israel, Kabul, Connecticut, Quito, Putamayo, Manhattan and
Herndon... it's all the same little world. It's my world and it's
your world. 
  You must help me stop this. "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going
to take it anymore..." 
  See you at A-20




No Lettuce This Week. Neat, huh?

8:45 pm: We have reached the Columbus statue. 
The stewards are telling everyone to calm down, 
but the cops are still firing rubber bullets and 
are baton-charging us to the rear. I am caught 
in a big crowd surge and the cops come perilously 
close to hitting me with their big sticks. I am 
not as fit as I used to be, but with about 500 
riot cops pegging it up the street after me, 
I ran like an Olympic champion!

Poet Jailed Over Protest Poem

9:41 a.m.  Wednesday 20mar02

POET JAILED OVER PROTEST POEM

A Saudi poet who penned verses which said Saudi Arabia's 
corrupt judges serve "tyrants" has been jailed and the 
editor who published the poem in a newspaper fired, a 
Saudi official told Associated Press Wednesday.
  Tarek Al-Issawi writes from Dubai that Prince Nayef, the 
interior minister, ordered Mohammed Mokhtar al-Fal, editor-
in-chief of the Arabic-language Al-Madina, to be fired a few 
days after the poem, titled "The Corrupt on Earth," appeared 
March 10. 
  It's not clear what poet, Abdul Mohsen Musalam was charged 
with or whether he would be formally tried. 
  The poem accuses the judges of taking bribes and ruling 
unjustly to "please tyrants." It took its title from the Quran, 
which rules that "the corrupt on earth" must be put to death.

Poem's introduction:

It is sad that in the Muslim world, justice is suffering 
from a few judges who care for nothing but their bank 
accounts and their status with the rulers.

Some of poem:

How many (sacred) verses and 
Sayings you have slaughtered.
Your beards are smeared with blood.
You indulge a thousand tyrants and 
Only the tyrant do you obey.

[caveat: I have not seen the whole poem, and this 
story was smothered in anti-Saudi context which I've
tried to remove here. I'm hoping I've kept in the
right facts. I'll include the URL here to the story
I read, but because it's Washington Post/AP I don't
expect it to have a shelf-life any more than an hour
or two (I'll try to find other references to this on
the net)]

WHY PAY BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD FOR THE RECIPE
TO HUNZA DIET BREAD WHEN IT'S HERE FREE:

After much searching I found the real Hunza Diet bread that everyone's 
trying to sell for eight dollars as multi-level network marketing fodder.

Here you go, my gift to the free world.

Dough:

3 ½ C of millet (or any grain for that matter. Darker is better for you, 
  lighter tastes more pleasing. Find a balance I guess.)
4 Tbl. brown sugar
1 Entire garlic (chopped up as finely as you can get it. Use powder or 
  salt if you have to but fresh is preferred)
2 t salt (sea salt preferably)
1 tsp. yeast, dissolved in the water
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (Vermont or Wisconsin whenever possible)
1 1/4 cups beer (micro-brews from Colorado if you can)
1 egg, beaten
1 C water (120°) fairly warm but not hot.

Glaze:

Tbl.. baking soda 
1 Cup boiling water
1 egg beaten 
1 t water

Directions:

Mix water, yeast, brown sugar, garlic and salt in 
a Food processor, or a large mixing bowl. Add flour
and mix until dough is smooth. Add more flour if 
sticky. (If Possible let the dough sit overnight 
in a plastic container in the fridge.)

Now divide the dough into 4, 6 or 12 pieces. Roll 
each piece into a rope, very thin, a little bigger 
than a pencil if your making 4 you can roll it about 
cigar size and 36 inches long .

Shape into an upside down U shape on your table. 
Bring the ends together and twist them.

Flatten the ends with your fingers and bring to the top 
of the bread and press in the dough to secure, making it 
look almost like you've tied it into a knot. Place on a 
greased cookie sheet.

Now let the dough raise for 30 minutes or til about double 
in size.

For a chewier crust put 2 Tbl. baking soda mixed with 4 Cup 
boiling water drop the dough in there for about the count of 
10 and then lift out with a strainer or pancake turner.

Brush with beaten egg and water solution. Sprinkle with coarse 
salt, garlic and parmesan cheese, cinnamon sugar, or sesame 
seeds. Bake in a hot oven 400 to 450 degrees (225 degrees C) 
for 12 to 15 minutes or until well browned.



PARODY SONG

Thank U Israel

How bout getting off of these antisemitics
How bout stopping whining when you're at war
How bout them transparent malingering degos
How bout that ever elusive shalom

Thank you israel
Thank you terror
Thank you ungratefulness
Thank you censorship
Thank you inconsequence
Thank you thank you violence

How bout me not blaming you for anything
How bout me enjoying the moment for once
How bout how good it feels to always forgive you
How bout shooting them all one at a time

Thank you israel
Thank you terror
Thank you ungratefulness
Thank you censorship
Thank you inconsequence
Thank you thank you violence

The moment I let go of it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

How bout no longer being intellectual
How bout remembering your divinity
How bout unabashedly blowing their brains out
How bout not equating death with murder

Thank you israel
Thank you providence
Thank you hatefulness
Thank you cunningness
Thank you fascism
Thank you thank you violence

24 Years Ago
  poem
  by lukexxiv

I do remember
our sorrow.
I could remember
our laughter.
I know that surely
we kissed,
and cried,
and ate
together.
I remember our
places, games
and plans we had.
Today is a song
out of tune.


"The death of Howard K. Smith last [ week ]
helped to emphasize how long it has been since American journalism has enjoyed real freedom to use the First Amendment for what it was intended to do. Smith was among the last of those who dared to inject his own opinion into the news he presented, regardless of whether that opinion was popular. He owned the only three abilities a newsman absolutely must have: he could read, he could write, and he could reason. He graduated from no school of journalism, where would- be reporters are today relieved of as much of those three abilities as possible, and he scorned the illusion of objectivity advocated by those schools, where students are evidently taught to feign stupidity if they cannot produce the real thing.







LINE
  a poem
by Katie Byrne

A line
white in color
with an insignificant size.
Holds my faith, my soul, my fate.

But why this line?
There are millions all over the world
who have been persecuted, tortured, and killed.

This ordinary white line,
stands for all those who have
experienced the rath of an unjust world.

What an extraordinary line.
Not as insignificant when looked at,
from the eyes of the innocent it's claimed.

they also sang "hey hey, ho ho, classic rock has got to go."
[08:56] <-------> jejeje
[08:57] <=====> _____:  I saw the video, but is dificult 
understand all for me
[08:59] <_____> I'm tempted to try to write up a transcript, 
but it's hard with realplayer I think.
[08:59] <-------> yo no entiendo mucho
[08:59] <=====> tell about what talk the video
[09:04] <_____> =====: ok

So rather than write a full transcript I'll write 
down a "loose paper" of what the people generally 
say and sing as I watch it a couple more times.

Lonely Lady in the Green House
  by Luke M

She rocked, waiting for the roof
to chip behind her eyes,
for the electric vibration to lift her bones from the ground.
She paused with her fingers wrapped
around the rose she concealed
knowing the lingering nails of respite
would peck into her body
as she brought the sweet relief of twilight
down upon herself.
