Spring Comdex '93
by Mark Maisel

     Once again, another Comdex is behind me and I'm glad.  I always
look forward to the shows and enjoy them, but there is a special
satisfaction in having it behind me.  They are really draining and the
time they take from my other activities makes it really tough to catch
up once I get home and sleep for a few days to recover.

     The Georgia World Congress Center expansion is nice.  The MARTA
train station is directly across the street from the site so commuting
via rail is quite attractive and leaves one sane at the end of a
frenzied day of mingling, gawking, and otherwise enjoying Comdex.  The
traffic in Atlanta is pretty stout stuff.  It doesn't quite compare to
New York City but it is getting there.  I had to drive some because of
parties after the show so I did my share of rush hour madness.
Fortunately, it was limited exposure and I had Raymond Hugh to keep me
company and mock the traffic.  The Center is a huge facility and was not
at all taxed to host all exhibitors who chose to exhibit for all comers.
As a matter of fact, substantial room remained empty in both halls so
Spring Comdex has plenty of room to grow if the Interface Group can
market Atlanta better than it has in the past.

     This year, IBM and Microsoft were attempting to make friends and
influence people.  Respectively, they were hawking the latest versions
of their new operating systems, OS/2 2.1 and Windows NT.  I didn't spend
much time with either of them as my mission was oriented toward
graphics.  I did stop at one of the five IBM booths to ask some
questions about the new OS/2 only to find that IBM still has a problem
with some of its people not knowing a damned thing about their products.
The woman I talked to could not answer any of my questions about the new
release.  I asked real basic questions like, "What is different in the
new OS/2?".  Her answer to that was, "I don't know.  They seem the same
to me."  Is this scary or what?  Microsoft provided space for myriad
vendors who have written applications and utilities for Windows NT.  I
thought it was a good way to show the products and the new operating
system.

     Word Perfect was another vendor trying to entice folks.  They
showed the new Word Perfect 6.0 for MS-DOS as well as many other
products for a variety of platforms.  I stopped to check out the new
Word Perfect since I have become quite the Word Perfect junkie over the
past few years.  I liked what I saw though the graphics mode available
in it was awfully slow on the machine I used at their booth.  The
software, as I recall, was not the release version so maybe they'll get
it running better before it is released.  The big change I was hoping
for is included in the new version; support for True Type fonts.  I have
Corel Draw 3.0 and it came with oodles of TT fonts.  It will be nice to
have access to them from DOS and Windows.

     As I stated earlier, my primary focus was graphics.  There were
lots of video adapter manufacturers there and I met with several of
them, hoping to obtain press information and evaluation units for
review.  I also met with folks from Viewsonic and Sampo in regards to
same for their line of SVGA monitors.  Viewsonic has a particularly
impressive new monitor they say will begin shipping in July.  It is a 21
inch, microprocessor controlled, multi-frequency monitor with a .26 mm
dot pitch, color control, and a top resolution of 1600x1200 pixels.
Needless to say, it is quite impressive.  It is also expensive as the
list price is around $2400.  If you are doing heavy duty CAD, DTP, or
other graphics work, you should definitely consider this monitor when
becomes available.  I was very impressed though I'd be terrified to have
something that large on my desk.  I expect that the DOS prompt would be
nearly an inch tall.

     Nothing at the show really caught my eye as have some things at
shows past.  I would say, however, that this show was an excellent one,
as such things go, since the overall quality and quantity of exhibits
was very high.  It was impressive and informative, a tough thing to
accomplish in such chaos.  If you wanted to go and didn't, it is too
bad.  You missed a good one.

     The nightlife was fun too.  I always like Spring Comdex because all
my Atlanta friends and those who are traveling show junkies like me get
together for parties and socializing after the show.  Sunday before the
show, Valeria Palmer hosted a dinner at her home for mostly ByteBrothers
participants and lurkers.  We viewed the latest GIFs, FLIs, and photos
as well as swapping stories.  Monday, we had a dinner at Manuel's Tavern
in the Virginia Highlands area of Atlanta.  It was a lot of fun though
there was some confusion that prevented some folks from finding us.
Wednesday evening, Hayes Microcomputer Products (the modem folks) gave a
reception for bbs types, sysops, and other folks who were interested.
It was a lot of fun.  Jim Harrer (Mustang Software), Mark Herring
(Sparkware), and Dennis Hayes (Hayes Microcomputer Products) spoke to
the assemblage briefly.  Dennis spoke primarily about ISDN
implementation.  If you don't know what ISDN is, please say so in a
letter to the editor and we'll whip up a tutorial.  ISDN is a
potentially wonderful way to increase flexibility and throughput on your
phone lines that is not receiving nearly the publicity or push it should
from the Regional Bell Operating Companies.  I made some grumbling
noises and one of the guys from Hayes overheard me.  He came over and
introduced himself.  Terry Rutter is his name and he knows a great deal
about ISDN.  We had a very nice chat for 20-30 minutes and I now have a
good source for information about ISDN should there be any interest in
an article.  I hung around after the show had ended, waiting for Friday
as I was invited to a barbecue in north Georgia.  It was great!  Thanks
to Greg Roberts for the fresh shoulder and ham and to Johnny & Paula
Bridges for extending the invitation.  It was an hour drive to and from
the Bridges residence but it was well worth it.

     It was a great week and while I'm glad it is over, I can't wait to
do it again.  As a matter of fact, I'll be leaving at the end of June
for PC Expo, yet another computer show that takes place each year in New
York City.  This will be my first time at this show and I hope to have
exciting things to share from that when it is over.  Unfortunately, I'll
probably miss the July issue but I'm sure it will keep till August if it
must.

     In closing and totally unrelated to Comdex, I am taking this space
to solicit suggestions for articles to be written by me for BTN.  I have
already taken a suggestion from Damion that I will try to have ready for
the July issue.  Please feel free to leave me a message on MATRIX main
board or in EZNet as I check those places most often.  If you are not
local or do not have access to these places, you can send me e-mail via
the Internet at the following address: PCWMARK@AOL.COM.  You may also
reach me on CompuServe at Mark Maisel,71154,365.

                      SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION


Featured herein are a couple of special features which weren't ready in
time for last month's issue:  Gwendolyn Norton's comments on being a
female BBS user in 1993, and my own BBSography of the last five years.
Enjoy, friends.

                  Women in BBSing, Or the Lack Thereof

by Gwendolyn Norton

     While the number of women using modems has been slowly increasing,
women are still an underwhelming minority in the BBS community.  I
became even more aware of as this as I was trying to find women on©line
to ask their opinions for this article.  Practically every time that I
logged on to The Matrix, I was the only female on.  This article is a
compilation of popular theories as well as my own interpretations on the
scarceness of women in BBSing phenomenon.

     For starters, I think that one big reason that most females never
even touch a computer is social conditioning and stereotypes.  Whenever
someone portrays a computer nerd, it is ALWAYS a male (such as can be
seen on the present EGGO commercial.) This kind of repeat conditioning
advertises it as something that females would not be interested in the
same way the Barbie and My Little Pony suggest that males would not be
interested in them by always portraying girls playing with them in the
commercials.  Also, for the females who choose to be "fashionably
stupid" because the men that they are interested in prefer to be
smarter than their women, computers have the image of being for
intelligent people (hence why they are operated by nerds.)  However, the
increasing simplicity and user friendliness involved with modeming and
computers in general decreases the need for technical knowledge and
opens the doors for socializing is likely largely accountable for the
building increase in our numbers.

     However, for those who do get into modeming (almost without
exception because they are an active male user's wife, girlfriend, or
sister) they are often quite horribly harassed and leave before they
ever get their roots planted.  Although I have experienced this from men
of all ages, mostly the males responsible for driving the females off
are 13-year-olds exploring the world of hormones.  Female new users have
no way of realizing that the guy explicitly proposing sex to them is
some 8th-grader, and instead pictures someone older and more
threatening.

     It takes a sense of humor to put up with the various offers/
proposals/predictions of future encounters.  I tend to find them rather
amusing (laughing at them, not with them) and remain completely
unoffended.  One of the more amusing opening lines that I ever got from
one of these cases was, "Hey, baby!  Wanna chat?  Wanna do OTHER
things?"  Assuming females to be innocent and naive, he went on to
explain to me what he had meant by "OTHER things."  However, even what's
amusing at first can become annoying, as one case (luckily, this only
happened this once) went on to constantly plague me with chat requests,
messages ("I love you.  There, I shocked you, didn't I?"), and would
continuously jump into chat with me while I was waiting for another node
to answer.  He was eventually locked out due to the complaints of others.

     So, what can be done to increase the female population in the
BBS community?  Well, for either gender, you can encourage your female
friends towards modeming, accenting on the communication benefits and
the simplicity of the process.  For males, if you're planning on
proposing sex to someone electronically, save it for an adult section
that would deem it appropriate.  For females, if you get harassed, don't
be driven away by it.  Either laugh at the guy and forget about it, or
if you are truly offended, leave a message explaining what happened to
the sysop.  S/he can check the chat records and verify your claim.

     I have noticed in the last four months a drop off in over-the-modem
sexual propositions to me.  Maybe it's because all the males out there
who wanted to proposition me have already done so, as I have been
calling BBSs for over a year and a half now, or more hopefully the guys
involved have either been warned by sysops or users to stop, or have
gotten the idea that what they might have considered to be a bit of fun
was actually horribly offending some users and stopped of their own
volition.  Whatever the means, the ends are certainly desirable and
hopefully will aid in a continued increase in the female population of
our BBS community.

               Known BBS Numbers for the Birmingham Area

                              1988 - 1993

                    -----------==========-----------

What you're about to see is a more-or-less complete index to all the
full-time bulletin board systems to grace our fair city since the
beginning of BTN's publication in April 1988.

The list itself is pretty self-explanatory.  Note that each system's
ORIGINAL number is given; if a board changed numbers, the newer number
is noted below the name in brackets.

SUPER-IMPORTANT!!  PLEASE NOTE! that this is ONLY a representation of
the BBS lists that appeared in BTN from issue #1 to last month.  It
is NOT intended to be a completely accurate chronology of exactly when
systems went up and went down; the month and year given indicate the
issue of BTN in which the BBS was listed.  Therefore, any errors
inherent in those original lists will be carried over into this list.

In other words, don't come complaining to me because your board was up
for longer than it says in this list!  This list only reflects what was
in BTN, which, I think we can all heartily say, is neither divine nor
error-proof.

It should also go without saying that this list is provided merely for
the historically curious; for a list of boards that are CURRENTLY
ACTIVE, please refer to the BBS list at the end of this issue of BTN.

"Available for Chat"
    by Jeff Vaughn


    Hello again folks.  It's time again for me to put my keyboard to the
test and talk about something mildly interesting or amusing.  Since The
Matrix has just upgraded to version 15.0, there's a little something to
work with this issue.

    One of my favorite past times is using the CHAT function on Matrix.
There are three good reasons for this.  One, Rocky has roughly eighteen
lines running simulultaneously.  Two, there are thousands of people to
abuse.  Three, the CHAT has finally upgraded to a bareable level.

    In the earlier versions of PCBoard, the node chat, well, sucked.
That's the only way to describe it.  BBS software like Telegard, VBBS,
and WWIV had long since gone to real-time chat and i was quite used to
it since i ran a BBS some time back myself.  PCBoard's chat was a
constant wait state and if someone was a bad typist, you really had to
have some serious patience to chat.  Now all that has changed.

    The new version 15.0 of PCBoard has greatly improved it's chat
function.  It has upgraded to a real-time chat with channels insted of
the old (G)roup chat or one on one with only one channel.

    Below is a cut and paste from the Matrix of the command list of the
CHAT function.  Everything below is 100% accurate to the letter.


()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()

Node Chat Functions
-------------------

Subcommands:  (G) (Q) (X) (CALL) (CHANNEL) (ECHO) (IGNORE) (HANDLE)
              (MENU) (MONITOR) (PRIVATE) (SEND) (SHOW) (SILENT) (TOPIC)
              (WHO)

              (G)        Goodbye, logoff system
              (Q)        Quit chat, return command prompt
              (CALL)     Calls another user into chat
              (CHANNEL)  Change to another topic (or channel)
              (ECHO)     Enable "echo" mode
              (IGNORE)   Ignore input from one or more nodes
              (HANDLE)   Change your name (or handle) for use in chat
              (MENU)     Redisplay the menu regardless of Novice/Expert
                         status
              (MONITOR)  Toggles monitoring of channels (optionally
                         accepts numbers indicating which channels to
                         monitor)
              (NOECHO)   Disables "echo".  Non-Echo Mode is useful for
                         split-screen chatting.
              (PRIVATE)  Make a conversation (or channel) private
              (PUBLIC)   Make a conversation (or channel) public
              (SEND)     Send a private message to another node in chat
              (SHOW)     Show users currently in chat
              (SILENT)   Toggle display of user entrance and exit
                         information
              (TOPIC)    Change the topic for the current channel
              (WHO)      Display who is online and what they are doing

Description:  Node chat allows 2 or more people to communicate with each
              other across separate nodes of the BBS.

              A Channel is a separate group of people or topic of
              conversation.  There are 255 channels available.  Use of
              the SHOW command will allow you to see what
              converstations, by topic, are currently taking place and
              who is involved in each.  The MONITOR command will let you
              listen in on all non-private channels to help you decide
              which conversations you might wish to join.  Typing
              MONITOR alone will toggle the function on or off.  Typing
              MONITOR followed by numbers will monitor specific
              channels.

              A Handle simply allows you to identify yourself without
              requiring that your entire name be used.  A Handle does
              not hide your identity (as seen by a WHO command in
              PCBoard) but merely provides you the ability to be known
              by another name while in chat.

              An Open Discussion is one in which others may freely
              join.  A Private Discussion prevents others, not already
              in the channel, from monitoring or joining.  The PRIVATE
              command can be used to make a channel private.  The PUBLIC
              command will make it public again.  Channel #1 can never
              be made private which leaves it open for newcomers to the
              chat.

              During the course of an open discussion you may notice
              other callers joining in.  An announcement of each arrival
              or departure is made to let you know who is in chat.  The
              SILENT command can be used to turn these announcements
              off.

              The CALL command lets you invite other users into your
              chat session.  These users may already be in group chat,
              or they may be out in the main part of the BBS.  As long
              as the user has not made himself unavailable and isn't
              busy performing other duties you may issue a CALL command
              to request his presence in chat.  It should be understood
              that the caller may decline your offer to chat.

                  NOTE: The CALL command is the ONLY way that someone
              outside of a Private Discussion can join.  Once you CALL
              the user, a flag is set that allows that user join.

              The SEND command can be used to privately send a one line
              message to another caller that is already in group chat.
              The caller does not need to be in the same channel as
              yourself.

              The IGNORE command allows you to ignore the input coming
              from one or more nodes.  If a caller, in your channel, is
              becoming a nuisance, that caller can be ignored.  However,
              ultimately the better solution would be to switch to
              another channel and make it private.

              The NOECHO command allows you to disable the input
              echoing that normally occurs.  With echoing enabled, your
              system must be capable of handling ANSI cursor position
              commands and even then you are limited to ONE line of text
              that can be typed ahead while another caller is typing.
              With echoing disabled, ANSI is no longer required and
              since a local split screen is used, none of the text is
              transmitted until you press enter so you may type more
              than a single line of text while others are typing. Type
              ECHO to re-enable echoing.

    Some of you might have noticed the SEND command.  That's a nice
little quirk that ORACOMM has used for quite some time.  It allows one
user to send a one-liner to another user privately.  It's sneaky, I like
it (grin).

   I would say that in the last two months, the CHAT has picked up a
good 80%.  A friend of mine, Marikae Worley, and I were constantly
getting into group chats after she got a computer and we seemed to
arrtact a lot of attention.  We'e been known to easily have 8-12 people
chatting at once.  Believe me, on the old group chat function, it was
totaly chaos, which was great 'cause that's what we had intended in the
first place.

   Names that are commonly known around the Matrix like our own Sysops
(Tom Egan and Rocky Rawlins), Richard Foshee, Scott Hollifield (yes, our
own BTN editor), and several others get on the chat occasionally and
create thier own personal havok for the fun of things.  [Editor's Note:
I deny everything.]  Since the introduction of handles to the new CHAT,
the names have become quite colorful as well (yes, you all know who you
are).  I have to give Richard credit for some of the more creative
handles (grin).

   I can honestly say that i've probably had some of the most
interesting (that's one way of putting it) concersations in my life on
the CHAT lines.  People tend to get very open behind the screen.
Sometimes they get a little out of control, but a user should know what
he or she is getting into once they type that CHAT command.  It ain't
Kansas by a long shot and is too weird to the Twilight Zone.  A hint to
the naive, expect anything in there.

   As a last note, if you happen to log on and want someone to abuse,
you can find me on channel 42 usually (it's a Hitchhiker thing).  Don't
forget to bring a towel.

                          Mail Doors.... continued

                          by David Moss


    In the last issue of BTN, Damion Furi and myself wrote articles
covering the two most popular mail doors (MarkMail and Tomcat).  In
this issue we'll cover the offline reader.  The offline reader I have
selected is OLX-TD.  Defined, this acronym stands for "Off-Line Xpress,
Test Drive."

    OLX-TD is a shareware mail reader and can be found on most of the
bulletin boards around town.  The registration cost for this program is
$40.00.  With that said, let's talk about shareware programs for a
minute.  There are a lot of good shareware programs that are written for
the purpose of allowing you to "try it before you buy it."  OLX is no
exception.  This test drive version does come with a lot of features,
but with registration, you'll get even more, as with all shareware.
So please consider registering your shareware.  This will insure the
continuing quality of shareware in the future.

    The shareware version of OLX comes in self extracting form.  The
full name of the file is: OLX-TD.EXE.  You will need to make a directory
for this program.  Also, you will need about 525k free disk space.  The
program comes with a 69-page manual that is comprehensive enough even
for the tough questions.  Once you've made the directory, copy the file
"OLX-TD.EXE" into that directory and type OLX-TD.  The files will self-
extract and you will be ready to go.

    The first item on the agenda is to browse through the documentation
that comes with OLX.  The name of this file is OLXTD.DOC.  It will give
you some good information about the use of the program.  The
documentation of OLX is very in-depth, so I will not cover it.  I will
leave that to the user.

    Now after browsing the documentation, and becoming familiar with
some of the options available to you, it's time to open the program.
Type OLXTD and the main screen appears.  The first thing we'll do is
cover setup.

     You'll notice that in the lower right of the screen the ALT-N -
Configuration on the menu.  This is where we want to go.  Hold down the
"ALT" key and tap the "N" key.  This will bring up the Configuration
Screen.  The first item is to define which directories you will keep
your QWK and REP packets.  QWK's are the packets you will download from
your favorite board, REP's are the replies that you will be sending back.
Here, I accepted the defaults of the home directory of C:\OLXTD.

    Next is the General configurations.  I accepted the defaults here
also.  You may want to change some of these settings, but for now they
should be sufficient to get started.

    Next is the Toggles configuration.  Since this is more of a
customization option than anything else, I accepted the defaults.  You
can always come back later to customize these settings to suit you.

    Next, is the Editor configuration.  I accepted the internal editor
provided with OLX.

    Next is the Replies option.  Here again I accepted the defaults.

    Next is the Packers option.  Unless you are dealing with an exotic
packer, accept all the defaults here.  Make sure the packers are in your
path.  Other than this, I see no reason to change any of these.

    Next are the final three:  Colors, Function Keys, and ALT Keys.  I
accepted all of the defaults on these as well.

    So far, I've learned that OLX comes ready to use.  Unless you have
some need to alter the basic configuration, I would accept the defaults
across the board.

    You will notice that OLX comes with a sample QWK from Mustang
Software.  This is a Welcome QWK which will take you on a tutorial of
OLX.  I highly recommend going through this tutorial.

    Ok, by now you're ready to make your mail run to your favorite
board.  One note here:  your communications software will download the
QWK to the directory you have specified in the set-up of that software,
usually the "down" directory.  However, you have told OLX that your QWKs
will be in the home diretory of OLX.  The solution is, that after every
mail run, you copy the QWK to the home diretory of OLX.  This can best
be achieved by a simple batch file that will do it automatically.  One
other note:  if you leave the QWKs in your "down" directory, the next
time you wish to download a new QWK, your communications software will
look in the "down" directory and see that the QWK is already there and
you will not get the new QWK.  The solution here is to erase the old QWK
prior to downloading the new one.  This too, is best achieved by writing
a batch file that will perform this chore for you.

    Now, simply copy the QWK to the home directory of OLX, start OLX,
highlight the name of the QWK and hit <ENTER>.  OLX will unzip the QWK,
and allow you to read the messages as you choose.  You will have the
option of replying to each of the messages or continuing without
replying.  Upon opening the QWK a separate screen will appear that will
give you the option of reading the new Bulletins, News, Mail, and the
new Files list of the particular board you have selected.  The new files
list is invaluable to all of us, as it will keep you up to date on new
uploads to the bulletin board.  This was covered in the first part of
these articles, and I would consider setting the mail door up to deliver
this to you as well as the bulletins and the mail.

    Back to OLX.  You will notice the options in the upper right corner
of the screen.  Reply, Next, Prev, ( for previous message ) Index, and
Other.  At any time, while reading a message, you have the option of
replying to that message.  Simply position the mouse on the Reply box or
use the "R" key.  OLX will then present a pop-up screen that will ask you
to confirm the choices of: From, To, Subject, Private, Carbon Copies,
Return Receipt, Conference #, and the Tagline you wish to use.

    A couple of notes on these subjects; follow the general rules of
etiquette, watch the profanity, do not attack the individual, if
engaged in a debate, debate the issue not the person, DON'T TYPE
EVERYTHING IN UPPERCASE, THIS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING, consider leaving
the reply "Private" or "Public", public mail generates new mail for you,
private mail generates very little, if any.  Confirm the other choices
such as Conference #.  If everything is agreeable, then the "F10" key is
used to edit the reply.

    During a reply, you will have the option of quoting the original
message.  Here, you should quote enough of the original message so that
others will have the gist of the conversation.  Delete the lines that
have no bearing on the subject in question.  In OLX the command to
delete the line is "Ctrl Y." If this conference is being echoed long
distance, then remember that the sysop pays for this out of his/her own
pocket.  So delete the appropriate lines as well as all the old tag
lines.

    After your reply, you will be given another chance to confirm the
choices you originally made.  Once you are satisfied, the "F10" key saves
the reply into a REP packet ready for upload when you are finished
reading the rest of the mail in this packet.

    A couple of final notes:  when you are ready to send the reply back,
rember that the REP is in the home directory of OLX.  This is often the
most troublesome area.  Here is how I do it, I call the board, enter the
mail room, select "U" for upload, at the prompt I hit the "Page Up"
key, next I hit <ENTER> to accept my default of Zmodem, next, I turn on
the "Insert" key where I type the complete path to the REP, in my case
it's C:\olx\ you won't have to enter the name of the REP, that will
already be displayed for you.

    I have just recently learned the fast way into Tomcat, the mail
room of Wildcat bulletin boards, it is (!John Doe Password) without the
parentheses.  This command takes you straight to the mail room on the
Wildcat board where the sysop has granted fast access.  You should enter
this all on one line.  This command is different from the regular fast
access command in that you would replace the "!" with an "*" in front of
the "Firstname."  The "*" in front of the "Firstname" takes you straight
to the Main Menu.  Remember, if the sysop does not allow fast access,
then these commands will not work.

    Final comments:

    At any time, while in OLX, remember that the F1 key provides on-line
help.  The F3 key provides a "Pick List" of options that are available
on a particular subject.

    When selecting a mail reader, keep in mind that there are several to
choose from.  If you find one a bit complicated, then try another one.  I
do not endorse any in particular.  I have just selected OLX as the one
to write about for this article as it is one of the most popular ones on
the bulletin boards.  However, it is the one I have chosen to use as my
personal mail reader.

    If you do find one you like, then please consider registering it.
You will get a lot of added features for a nominal cost.

    Last but not least, don't hestitate to ask the sysop of the board
you happen to use for assistance.  I have never found a system operator
that is not willing to spend time to help someone get acquainted with
the mail room.  The system operator is there and knowledgeable, so don't
be timid about asking questions.  I do it all the time!


NOTE ON SLMR FROM DAMION FURI: OLX-TD is a the commercial version of SLMR
(Silly Little Mail Reader, also known as SLiMeR).  Current SLMR users may
want to seriously consider switching because of the new utilities included
with the package.  SLMR provides nothing more than a limited tagline
manager, and the basic ability to unarchive, read, edit, and re-archive
.QWK and .REP packets.  OLX-TD allows the user to delete, rename, sort, and
mark as unread the available .QWK packets. Because SLMR was abandoned to
the public domain, many users (myself included) have hacked out the random
Fn screen characteristic of the unregistered version.  Since SLMR is now
impossible to register, my understanding is that this is legal (I could be
wrong; I'm not an attorney).  The $40 registration is more than worth it
for the majority of OLR users.

                        How I Spent My Saturday

                                  or

                           Jeez, I'm Tired....

                                  by

                             Lurch Henson



        Well, I'm kinda glad that's all over with, though knowing the
state of TV news in B'ham, it won't be for long.....  Let's see, how did
*I* spend last Saturday?  Hmmmmmmmm, not sleeping, like I should have
been, that's for sure....  In fact, I didn't sleep from Thursday night
through Saturday night, and FELT IT too....

        Ok, Saturday morning arrives.....I get off of work around 7am,
jump in the car and hunt down the Southern Museum of Flight, a place
I've never been to before....  I find it, a little later than I wanted
to, and stand around out front with Bob and his cohorts....  When the
museum lady finally shows up, I helped them carry in some of their last
minute goodies (including some popcorn, something I KNOW Lindy didn't
have with him... <<Smile>> ), and then stood around heckling Bob while
he warmed up for take-off.  (And yes, people, Bob DID fly into the trees
at the end of the runway during one of his practice take-offs....I guess
he just wanted to get it out of his system, eh?)

        Anyway, not too long after we got inside, other people started
showing up, and I let them take over my heckling duties (Bob seems to
draw this out of people....he's SO much fun to rib), while I stood
around and watched things for awhile.  As take-off time approached, he
kicked off the engines on the plane, and let it "warm-up", for dramatic
effect, I suppose...  Someone decided that I wasn't doing enough, so
they shoved Bob's video camera in my hands and told me to walk around
and film everything.  Tom Egan managed to have a tape delivered right
before take-off, so he covered what I didn't, and there should be plenty
of GIFs and a few tapes of everything available soon (or already, by the
time you read this).  After Bob cleared the trees at the end of the
runway, and was on his way to France, Tom told me I could put away my
gun, then told Bob he was going to have had me shoot him if he screwed
it up and didn't make it off the ground.  I don't think Bob would have
noticed....  <<GRIN>>

        After he was well on his way, I handed the camera off to someone
else, said my good-bye's, and went home to get out of my uniform and get
cleaned up.  I caught a quick shower, checked my msgs on Teasers, then
rushed out to make it to the picketing.  I managed to get there just as
Rocky was getting everyone together, and herding them all across the
street.  From what I was told, Channel 13 said that if we showed up,
THEY would show up, and would cover the story.  I guess that was too
much to hope for, eh?  Anyway, WE showed up....we DEFINITELY showed up.
I've heard many different counts of how many people were actually there,
but the one time, early in the demonstration, that I counted heads I
came up with about 56, and that's not including the people that were out
of my sight around the various corners....because we were spread out
quite some distance at the time.  I made the mistake of standing on the
side of the street with the 13 sign, and got rather burnt.  Took me
several days to heal from the damage, but I consider it as having been
in a good cause.  I got smart after about a half hour and moved to the
other side of the street, standing in the shade of the large tree on the
corner, watching all the people drive by, trying to read what we had on
our signs (mine said "13 Misled You").  I think we actually might have
had too many people there to be truly effective in getting the word out,
because people couldn't read the signs, there were too many of them to
read while in motion (the accident that happened when we first walked
out should show that).  But, those stopped at the light DEFINITELY knew
that all these people were more than slightly upset at Channel 13, even
if they didn't know why.....(Janet's oldest son did a great job of
rushing out to the cars stopped in traffic and handing out the little
Matrix handouts, though, so some people managed to learn a few things
that day).

        After we'd been out there about two hours, Rocky gathered
everyone together, snapped yet another picture (Tom made sure the event
was WELL documented in both film and video), and sent everyone on their
way.  I'm VERY glad that he did it that way, because I REALLY didn't
like the idea of it ending up being 5 or 6 people standing around waving
a sign late in the afternoon, after everyone else had drifted off,
because you KNOW that would be the time 13 would come down off the hill
to cover the picketing.  (One little side note here.  A friend of mine
that couldn't show up because she was walking a dog in the Doo-Da parade
that day told me that there were several Channel 13 people in the
dunking booth at Doo-Da Day.  If we'd known about that at the time,
wouldn't it have been fun to show up there, and line up at the booth,
smiling for the cameras while dunking the 13 people?  We could have
carried our signs over there and made our point, while spending the
dunking money on yet another good cause, the Humane Society.)

        When I left the demonstration, I hustled back to the museum to
see how Bob was doing, to see if he had splattered on the pavement or
ran into a tree (ask him about the reporter that scared the Hell out of
him at 4000 feet.... <<Smile>> ).  By this time I was REALLY feeling the
lack of sleep, and was probably less supportive of Bob than I should
have been, but I figured he needed a good ribbing to keep him going, and
he WAS doing it for a good cause, remember.....  So, I looked around the
museum a little, talked to the woman that ran it for a few minutes, and
told Bob I'd be back that evening to watch over things for him like I'd
promised.  I stumbled out the the car and managed to get back to the
house ok, and when I got here I fell out into the bed, not in the mood
to deal with anyone or anything for a few hours, hoping to be able to
sleep.  No go, phone rings, have to deal with a few problems, fall out
again.  Phone rings again.....few more things to deal with.....fall out
again....  You get the idea, one thing after another, and SURPRISE, time
to get dressed and head out to the museum.  I pull on my uniform, go see
the woman running the place, make a few suggestions to her concerning
security a the place, then lockdown, and watch Bob fly awhile.  After
things have run smoothly for awhile, and nothing is going wrong, I take
off and get me some sleep....FINALLY.

        P.S.  That was Saturday....Sunday I ran back out to the museum,
and donated some archaic computer equipment, and a few bucks I couldn't
spare, to Bob's cause, and heckled him a little more.  As time for his
landing approached, more and more of the BBS community showed up to see
if he'd actually make it, or if he'd screw up and land it somewhere he
wasn't supposed to be.  By the time he was approaching the airport, he
had quite a few people leaning over his shoulder, and a TV camera and
newspaper reporter practically in his lap.  I know Lindy had it rough
after flying 33 1/2 hours, but he was alone in the cockpit, he didn't
have to worry about everyone in the room, and at home later on the news,
watching him crack up.  Bob did a nice job of it, and after flying all
the way across the ocean only missed it by 40 feet....I'd call that
good shooting, wouldn't you?

        P.P.S.  I know this isn't my normal raving, but to tell you the
truth, I really didn't feel like it tonight, and besides, I'm sick as a
dog right now, and you're lucky to get anything from me this month....
Hope it isn't TOO disjointed....I know I'm going to have fun reading
this when Scott puts out BTN this month....it'll be a surprise to me....

                             Telecommunications

                                    by

                                Damion Furi


   I have been immersed in Turbo Pascal, Unix, system configuration
arguments with my mother, my girlfriend's BOOMING flower business, and
a lot of other things.  Consequently, I didn't have time to write a
technical article on OLR-related subjects (scheduled for June), and I
apologize to everyone that was looking forward to it; I will make every
effort to resume my part of the OLR series next month.

   I do have an announcement to make, though, that will probably be of
interest to the majority of BTN readers.

   I am currently in the midst of designing a comprehensive modular
integrated telecommunications package for active BBS users and sysops.
The basic idea is to cover all bets in one package in such a way as to
make it easy for novices and advanced users alike to maximize the
potential of BBSes and related services.

   The following is my current list of potential modules:

                           1) Terminal
                           2) Offline Mail Reader (similar to RoboMail)
                           3) Tagline Manager (multiple assignable files)
                           4) Spell-Checker (10,000 words + user entries)
                           5) Dictionary (10,000 words + user entries)
                           6) Thesaurus (5,000 words + user entries)
                           7) Bulletin Board System
                           8) Archive Interface (such as SHEZ)
                           9) File Catalog Utility w/disk stuffer
                          10) Automated Utility (such as RoboComm)
                          11) Script Language w/compiler
                          12) Universal Editor w/ANSI art capability
                          13) BBS QWK Door
                          14) Fax Utility w/OCR
                          15) DataCore Shareware Security (unregistered)

   Version 1.0 is scheduled to be a single node system.  Version 2.0 is
scheduled to be a multi-node system with a multi-tasking kernal for
internal module use (the multi-tasking capability with not be available
for unrelated software use).  Context-sensitive hypertext help will be
available from version 1.0 and up.

   Each module will have a number of hooks available for external
additions, including third-party software.  For example, my editor will
be for use with all of my modules, but you could install one or many
third-party external editors in whatever fashion suits you.  As another
example, you could use either my QWK mail door or another one (such as
MarkMail or BGQWK) with the BBS module.

   Originally, I had scheduled six months for designing this behemoth.
However, after actually getting into this, I have moved this deadline
to one year.  Further, after having outsmarted myself in numerous ways,
I have decided to throw the door open for suggestions.

   If you have a pet peeve about your favorite communications-oriented
software (DOS only; this will NOT be a Windows, OS/2, or DesqView
compatible package), or if your favorite package has some exceptional
quality, or if you simply have a wish list, please let me know.  Your
contribution to this project stands an excellent chance of being
incorporated.

   For example, editor macros will be assignable as: Fn, ALT+Fn,
CTRL+Fn, SHIFT+Fn, CTRL+ALT+Fn, SHIFT+ALT+Fn, SHIFT+CTRL+Fn, and
SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+Fn, for a total of 96 possible macros.  If someone can
demonstrate that this will not be sufficient, I will seperately define
left and right SHIFT keys (for 180 possible macros) and leave the
physical problems of actually accessing these keystrokes to the user,
AND I'll make it possible to use named macros (stored as files)
WordPerfect 5.1-style.  I may do that anyway.

   All user-configured files will be in ASCII format, rather than some
cryptic format that I would have to design.  The editor will have a
special forms utility included that will allow the user to specify file
type to be edited; it will come up in a dBase IV-style predefined fields
setup, so that no one can accidentally create a file that my modules
can't read.

   As much as possible, I'm going to write the software equivalent of
Silly Putty, and let my users worry about how to implement it.  Your
input is requested.

   For those of you that took one look at this and decided that I'm not
going to let it go cheap, you're right.  However, each module will be
available for registration independently of the rest, and each module
will be totally independent of the other modules (for example, you will
be able to use my QWK door with PCBoard or GT Power instead of MarkMail
or BGQWK).

   My BBS module will be designed to compete against PCBoard and
WildCat!; my offline mail reader will be designed to compete with
RoboMail; my automated utility will be designed to compete with both
RoboComm and IntelliComm; my terminal will be designed to compete
with Telix and QModem, etc.  This is in terms of practical usage, not
price.  In terms of price, my package will probably be somewhat more
expensive.  The advantage is that it will be worth every penny.

   The drawback is that shareware users that have a bad habit of not
registering their software won't like it.  The shareware version will be
built around what I call the DataCore, which will utterly control every
aspect of every module.  The shareware version of each module will work
ONLY with the DataCore present, and only on the following schedule:

                           1 - 30 days = Fully Enabled
                          31 - 60 days = Nagware*
                          61 - 89 days = Crippleware**
                               90 days = Self-destruct***


* Minor nags will pop up at random, but well-spaced, intervals.  Nags
  will not interefere with normal operations.

** Annoying utilities and functions will be disabled.

*** The DataCore will perform a series of events that result in the
    modules being rendered unusable; the only way to get around this
    will be a complete re-installation from scratch (even
    user-configured files won't be useful).


   Registered users will receive a special version of the module(s) that
will not rely on the DataCore, and will execute MUCH faster.  Users that
register the entire package at once will receive a discount and a
completely integrated system with certain functions and utilities that
other users won't receive.

   Source code will not be distributed.


   Again, I am actively soliciting suggestions.  You may contact me via
The Matrix, Alter Ego, Crunchy Frog, Owlabama, Weekends, DPA, or
Nirvana.

   Many thanks!

Masquerade



     Clutching your invitation in your hand, you find yourself facing
the entranceway to what appears to be the manor house of an ancient
plantation.  Forsaken by humanity, this world seems frozen in time; even
the Spanish moss which adorns the ceiling of the veranda dares not stir.
You glance down at the silver-embossed invitation.  The time and place
are correct.
     As you approach, the double doors swing silently open.  Before you
is a long corridor lined with doors and illuminated by ten candlelit
chandeliers hanging from high Gothic arches.  The faint strains of a
Rococo waltz beckon to you from somewhere within.
     A chill draft envelops you as you step into the dimly lit interior.
Your eyes are drawn to the massive inlaid doors which fill the far end
of the corridor.  The intricate melody grows imperceptibly louder as
you wander deeper into the labyrinthine structure.
     After walking for several moments, you are overcome by a sudden
disquieting feeling.  Glancing upward, you realize that you seem to have
made no progress: ten chandeliers hang before you.  You look back,
momentarily confused.  The corridor extending into infinity is
featureless.
     Impulsively, you reach for the nearest doorknob.  Your hand closes
on nothingness.  The doorway fades into oblivion and you find yourself
facing a blank wall.  Startled, you glance about.  The large
silver-inlaid doors loom not three feet before you.
     As you step cautiously forward, the ceiling-high mahogany doors
swing slowly inward,  revealing an immense ballroom.  The haunting tune
entwines you as you step forward into the light of three crystal
chandeliers and innumerable candles in silver and crystal wall brackets.
Mirrors catch the candlelight and splinter it into rainbow shards on the
gleaming ebony floor.  Silver cornices sparkle above the wine coloured
velvet draperies.  A dais lies at the far end of the room, draped in
black velvet, and a small army of silver and ebony chairs with deep
velvet cushions line the champagne tinted walls.
     You walk slowly forward into the spacious room, hearing the doors
close softly behind you.  A backward glance shows no visible presence;
you appear to be alone in the room.  The music intensifies suddenly, and
you whirl to see one corner of the room filled with a seated chamber
ensemble.  They play on, seemingly oblivious to your presence, as you
cross the room toward the dais.
     Before you are halfway there, you notice a sudden change in the
quality of the light.  It takes you a moment to locate the source, a
shimmering field of luminescence at the center of the dais.  As you
watch, it takes on the outlines of a human and begins a prismatic shift
toward darker hues.  In the space of a single breath, the light is gone
and before you stands one of the strangest figures you've ever laid eyes
on.
     The newcomer stands about six feet tall, with silver-streaked black
hair braided over one shoulder and deep green eyes.  His slightly
angular features are covered with white powder and greasepaint almost in
the style of a clown, with a red diamond surrounding each eye and his
mouth.  He is dressed in a bulky gray duster and darker suit, and holds
a chrome guitar in his left hand.  His right rests on the silver swept
hilt of a rapier jutting from inside his coat.  His eyes meet yours and
he grins widely and sincerely.
     "Good evening to you, my friends!" he calls out, in a clear voice,
and suddenly you realize that you are not alone.  You stand in the midst
of a crowd of people, whose eyes are all fixed on the figure on the
dais.  "I am Lord Harlequin, Primus of House Merinita, and I welcome you
to the Masquerade!"
     Harlequin sets the guitar down almost reverently, then leaps off
the dais and strides quickly across the room toward you.  He clasps your
hand in both of his, smiles, and greets you by the name and title given
in your invitation.  He goes through the crowd, welcoming everyone.  As
he passes, you notice that his ears are slightly pointed, and the left
one appears to be made of steel.  Before you have much time to think
about it, however, he begins leading everyone forward.
     "Gather round, everyone.  There's a bit of business to resolve
before we get started, so if you would just take a seat, or stand if you
prefer..."  Harlequin trails off as he ascends the dais.  He lifts his
guitar from one of the two chairs and turns back to face the crowd.
     "Ours is a gathering of noble, enlightened souls, but I find that
one rule is indeed necessary to sustain the atmosphere of the
Masquerade.  All correspondences must be in the descriptive style, as
you see here.
     "I'm sure many of you have myriad questions to ask, and I promise
that I shall try to answer them as best I can.  However, I have a small
matter to attend to at the moment, and I shall leave you in care of your
very capable hostess, Lady Ariana.  I will return as soon as I can, and
hopefully more properly attired for the occasion."  Harlequin steps
backward, shifting colors, and vanishes.
     As the pale, slender woman rises from the left of the two chairs
on the dais, you realize that she has been there all along.  Her
shimmering white gown, simply cut with wide sleeves and a deep V
neckline, reaches the ground.  Her waistlength amber curls are adorned
only by a wreathe of white flowers.  A distinct hush falls over the
room, and she addresses you in a light melodic voice.
     "I bid you welcome, noble guests, for I am Ariana Elanor.  I
formally declare the commencement of the Masquerade, and bless it as I
am able.  And now, a toast, as we await the return of the Master,"
Ariana gestures imperceptibly and several female servants in very simple
champagne tinted robes weave throug the crowds bearing intricately
etched circular silver trays.
     Each tray is laden with flowing crystal goblets overlaid with
silver in a delicate pattern.  Ariana takes one from a passing tray and
it immediately fills with a slightly iridescent clear liquid.  Taking a
goblet from the nearest tray, you watch it fill with a similar
substance.  Ariana raises her glass, her grey-blue eyes filling with
memories.
     "To the shafts of sunlight that filter through the clouds tprovide
us with illumination, to the healing moonlight which floods the midnight
world, and to the stars which guide and keep us."
     Ariana drains her glass in a single toss.  Taking a sip, you find
that it tastes of honeysuckle and something else you can't identify.  As
you finish your drinks, the champagne-clad women return to collect the
goblets.
     Harlequin reappears in the now-familiar prismatic gateway, this
time dressed in Baroque finery, all black.  He carries a violin case
under one arm and the rapier hangs at his side.  Ariana steps to the
edge of the dais, and Harlequin kisses her hand lightly and assists her
to the floor.  He then leaps up to the front of the dais and turns to
face the crowd.  "Let the Masquerade begin!" he shouts.
     The musicians take to their instruments and the low hum of strings
fills the air.  Harlequin places the violin case on the dais and opens
it, revealing a beautiful Stradivarius.  As he raises the instrument to
his shoulder, the very air seems to stir, ghostly figures whirling into
substantiality.  Ariana curtsies to a tall, dark-headed shade.  He takes
her in his arms and they seem to fade into the panorama.
     And then Harlequin brings down the bow and launches the orchestra
into Saint-Saens' "Danse Macabre".  He moves with the music, lost in his
art.  Now the room is full of dancers, spirits whirling and laughing and
beckoning for you to join them.  Your gaze, however, is drawn back to
the violinist.  Every move Harlequin makes is grandiose and expressive.
It seems almost as if he's drawing the music out of the air by sheer
force of will.  And then he locks eyes with you, grins widely, and
winks.
     The dance continues.

                                          Lord Harlequin
                                          Lady Ariana

"A little dazed, a little confused, and a little excited"
    by Jeff Vaughn


    Well, here we are again, standing at a crossroads.  I just wrote a
very large article concerning Led Zeppelin, and a week later I hear
they're getting back together.  It's all too bizzare, and a little
phenomenal.  I would consider this a bogus rumor, but I heard it on a
morning news show on ABC and that's really not to be taken lightly.

    For the last thirteen years I have been a diehard Led Zeppelin fan,
and one of my lifetime wishes was to go to a Led Zeppelin concert.  For
a long time, I was really down because of the fact that the band split
up in 1979 and all had claimed they would never get back together
because of the loss of John Bonham.

    Now it seems as though my dream may come true.

    Jimmy Page and David Coverdale had recently taken on a joint
venture that was to be originally called "The Page/Coverdale Experiment"
and then they changed it to just "Page/Coverdale".  David Coverdale,
having a voice that was close to Robert Plant was an ideal choice, and I
think Page had that in mind when they got together.  Coverdale wasn't
going very far since the break-up of WhiteSnake, so he had everything to
gain by accepting.

    Jason Bonham had recently put together a band named "Bonham" and
released only 2 albums.  Both of their albums, in all realities, really
bombed.  There were maybe 2 good songs on the entire set and you can't
tour on just two songs.

    John Paul Jones, I have heard, has been doing session music and not
much more.  He's sorta been out of the picture because he was considered
the 'silent' member of the group.

    Robert Plant seemed to have the best running solo career of the
group.  Plant went on after Led Zeppelin and put out great albums such as
"Principle of Moments" and "Now and Zen".  Personally, I think "Manic
Nirvana" really sucked and I only listened to the tape once.  That was a
wasted $8.  When Plant put out "Now and Zen" he claimed that he didn't
want to recreate Led Zeppelin, but I guess he couldn't help it.  The
whole album had a Zeppelinish sound to it.  "Principle of Moments" had a
few good cuts on it such as "The Big Log" and "In The Mood".

    Jimmy Page went on several ventures.  Only one of them seemed to get
slightly noticed and that was when Page pieced together a band called
"The Firm" and recorded a song called "Radioactive".  The song had
ultimate Zeppelin guitar licks in it, but didn't have the Plant voice to
back it.

    I believe their most memorable moments were when the band got back
together for their reunion jams.  People crowded and they felt like Led
Zeppelin again.  Honestly, I think that's the way it should be.  Some
people say there's no room for Led Zeppelin in the '90s.  I totally
disagree.  There are too many memories and too much good music to throw
away.  All Zeppelin has to do is bend a little without breaking the
Zeppelin sound.  I believe it can be done.

    As a final word, all I can say is I, for one, will look forward to
their return if the rumors are true.


    Welcome back, guys.......
