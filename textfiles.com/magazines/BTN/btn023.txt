WHITHER BTN?
by Dean Costello

     It occurred to me one fine evening when I was parasitizing off of
dear Mark; what would the Birmingham telecomputing scene be like without
Mark Maisel.  I don't know.  Let us take a look at the occurrence.

     It is 1992.  Mark has surrendered the collating of BTN to a
consortium of people who decided that they could take over the reins for
a while.  It prospered for a couple of months, and then died a thankful
death.

     Why?

     Because Mark was not involved in it, that's why.  It is his heart
and soul that keeps BTN in production.  It is his ceaseless whining that
makes people write articles for him.  It is his (and Kathy's) pizza that
keep people happy.

     Consider a BTN party that Mark does not have a large hand in
preparing.  Would people still come to them? Undoubtedly, but that begs
the question of how many people would still come to them if he was not
involved with BTN anymore.  For example, let us say that Mark has
dropped out of BTN, and a given sysop hosts a BTN party. I would assume
that a pretty good percentage of people would still come.  Then about 2
months later, another sysop gives a party.  I would say that with each
succeeding party less and less people would attend.

     Why?

     Because Mark is not involved anymore, that's why.  And I feel
confident that most of you will agree to that assessment.  So, the
upshot of this? Without Mark Maisel involved with the telecommunications
systems of Birmingham, we would be much the poorer...

     MY GOD! What have I written? Jesus, my pancreas is starting to
hurt, this is so sicky-sweet.  More importantly, why have I written this
drivel? Oh yes, now I remember.  OK Mark, are you satisfied? I
humiliated myself in front of thousands (or at least tens) of computer
users all over the city, and even in Torino, Italy.  I trust the debt is
paid off, right?

     I feel like I have been raped... at least metaphorically. Forced to
give up something (my dignity) against ones will is always a traumatic
experience.  This is the kind of thing that happens whenever it is close
to deadline, and there is no editorial written, and Mark has the ability
to hold something over my head. Be fair, picture the situation.  We go
out to lunch, and he offers to pay.  Good enough, in and of itself,
right? WRONG! Since as a result of that, he then has a stick to use
whenever the mood strikes.  And apparently the mood has struck this fine
day. ARGGGHH! I hate doing things against my will.

     Do you know how this all started? One fine day I was on Crunchy
Frog, (where he was visiting, and that spineless sysop, Monty let him
near the keyboard) and he popped in and said, "Hey Dean <this being
before he called me Deanie Weanie> why don't you drop by so we can meet
each other>" I said okay, and wandered over.  He seemed nice enough, and
so did his wife, Kathy, for that matter.  And do you know what I do now?
He calls me up and says that he is too 'busy', and he wants me to do the
shopping for him.  Ch-rist, this is too much! Way too damn much!

     The conclusion to be drawn? Hell if I know.  He seems to have made
a difference in the local computer scene.  Would someone else have
filled his position if he weren't around? Got me.  All told, probably a
net gain for Birmingham.  For me, it is a different story, but I do know
this much, I am not convinced that I have gotten the good end of this
relationship, the way he takes advantage of me all of the time.  But
maybe, just maybe, before I leave, it will all even out.

     Oh yeah, another thing, my folks came down about 3 weeks ago or so.
Guess who made a good impression on them? You guessed it.  And people
wonder why I want to leave the South.  Oh, by the way, I am down here
against my will since my GPA was so low out of college that UAB was the
only school in the entire U.S. that would accept me to their program. My
last day down here cannot come to soon.

     And you know all the articles in this issue? I couldn't care less
about any of them.  So read them for your own lazy-ass self.  I don't
give a damn anymore.

What Is the SDN?
by Howard Duck,
Sysop of The DUCK Pond

     Late last year, I decided I was bored with seeing the same old
IBM/MS-DOS files lying around here.  Some had been here since 1985! I
couldn't decide which ones to throw away (basically because I was too
lazy to look at each and every one of them, one at a time).  So... I
threw them ALL away.

     Not really.  I did decide to sort of start all over, though.  You
see there was this network that I had heard about some time ago, called
the SDN. (Actually, the creators of SDN keep insisting that it should be
called "SDNet/Works!" or something like that, but everyone I know just
calls it SDN.) At any rate, it's an international network of bbses like
Fidonet except instead of trading messages, these bbses trade files.  I
had looked into it before when it was just getting started, but now it
had had time to grow and as I said earlier, I was feeling awfully bored
with the same old filenames staring me in the face, and besides, my
phone bill isn't big enough, so...

     I checked around, and I found there was no SDN source in the area,
which meant I could apply to the gods of SDN for a node number and a
pickup point.  They were satisfied with my credentials (fooled them!)
and sometime in December (I think, though my memory is notable only for
its failures) I set-up to receive SDN files.  I then threw away 90% of
my MS-DOS software.  Out went all the games, and gifs, and most of the
utilities.  I kept the archivers like ZIP, LHARC, ZOO, etc., and I kept
some term programs like TELIX.  (I figured this is the kind of stuff all
bbses need for novices.) I also kept about a month's worth of recent
local uploads.  But all the rest I just junked, and now I had plenty of
room for the files to come.  (And boy, it really makes my backups go a
lot faster!)

     So I began polling my pickup point in North Carolina.  The bbs
automatically calls there three times per week, on Saturday, Monday, and
Wednesday mornings around 5 a.m.  New arrivals are automatically posted
to the SDN_NEW directory and retained there until early Saturday when
they are tossed into appropriate directories.  I seem to be getting
about 1 MEG per week, though it fluctuates greatly from week to week.
(Backups are starting to get a little longer... Hmmm, I wonder what I'll
do when I've got as much SDN stuff as I had regular uploads? Well,
that's a long way off.)

     But what are these SDN files? Well, SDN distributes shareware,
"almost direct" from the author.  The author sends his software to a
central location and from there it is sent via phone to other bbses in
the network.  The idea being that users of these SDN points are thereby
guaranteed virus-free software, and the authors are guaranteed a speedy
distribution of their work, without tampering of any kind.  I may be
pressing my luck to say this, but I have yet to have any problems with
viruses, so this aspect of the SDN doesn't seem all that big a deal to
me.  I did find it frustrating to get uploads from users who had taken
it upon themselves to remove doc or in some other way alter the
archive.  It is nice to get software and be able to refer to doc files
instead of curse the uploader for his oversight.

     Anyway, I have been receiving SDN shareware for several weeks now
and am now a bit more familiar with the kind of thing one can expect
from the network. Most of what comes through is business-oriented
programming.  Here's a sample of a recent week's worth of SDN
transmissions (This is a copy of my files list from the SDN_NEW files
area, including the header.):


-   THE FOLLOWING SDN FILES ARRIVED SINCE THE PREVIOUS FRIDAY   -
-(As with all SDN files, use PAK210 to extract individual files)-

     The files with the .SDN extension are archives.  The files ending
in .SDA are ASCII text files that the user can read via the OPUS Type
command while online.  They contain brief descriptions of the associated
.SDN files. As you can see, the files aren't all fun'n'games.  In the
past two or three months I don't think I've yet seen one game come
through.  Maybe someday.

On The DUCK Pond, the SDN files are in the following areas:

# 9  SDN: NEW ARRIVALS
#10  SDN: Business and Financial
#11  SDN: Communications
#12  SDN: Databases and Spreadsheets
#13  SDN: Graphics, CAD, Entertainment, Learning
#14  SDN: Programming and Programming Languages
#15  SDN: Miscellaneous Shareware
#16  SDN: Utilities, File Management, etc.
#17  SDN: Word Processing, Text Editors, Printer Utilities
#18  SDN: Non-shareware Specialties & SDN HELP FILES

     Note, that unlike the other file areas on The DUCK Pond, users
can't upload to SDN areas.  That is part of the no-tampering/virus-free
guarantee.  Files in these ten areas are provided by the author, not
uploaded by a local user.

     By now, most of these areas have something listed.  One of the
more useful ones appears to be AMTAX89.SDN, a rather full-featured tax
program.  It has the more common forms built-in, and can even print them
ready for submission to the IRS.  Probably not as good as the commercial
programs like MACINTAX but it looked superior to anything I'd seen
before in the shareware category. Here's the way the AMTAX89.SDA file
described it:


AM-Tax 1989                               REGISTRATION $20-60
BUSI FEB90 AMTAX AM TAX 1040 IRS FEDERAL
FILES: amtax89.sdn

New to SDN


AM-Tax is  a  software  program designed to assist you in the
preparation of your 1989 federal tax return.  There are three
versions of AM-Tax, a shareware program and two  versions  of
the  registered  program.   This  is the shareware version of
AM-Tax.  It can prepare a complete tax return  consisting  of
the  Form 1040 and any of the Schedules (A, B, C, D, E, F, R,
and SE).

The printed copy of the Form 1040  cannot  be  filed  (you'll
need  to transfer the figures to an official form).  However,
this program will print all of  the  Schedules  in  a  format
accepted  by  the  IRS.  For those with relatively simple tax
situations, the shareware version may be all you need to use.

You should find AM-Tax easy  to  learn  since  it's  designed
around  the  federal 1040.  Supporting documents are accessed
by pressing the F6 key when you're on a line calling for  one
of  the  schedules  or  forms included in the AM-Tax program.
General-purpose worksheets are also available to enhance your
record keeping.  For instance, to keep a permanent tax record
of your medical expenses, tell AM-Tax to itemize that line of
the Schedule A.  AM-Tax will add up  the  expenses,  transfer
the total to the line itemized, and print a detailed list for
your  records.   Up  to  50  lines  of your tax return can be
'itemized'  and  up  to  45  items  can  be  listed  on  each
worksheet.


(SDA format Copyright 1990 SDN Project for SDNet/Works! (sm))


     Sounds pretty good to me, but I'm too poor (sob) to have any use
for a tax preparation program, so I've not used it.  Maybe someone else
out there will try it and give the rest of us a review.  (Mark paid me
to say that.)

     So that's it.  SDN is here in Birmingham if anyone is interested.
(It's even here if no one is interested.) So if you are paranoid about
viruses, and especially if you are looking for productivity software for
business, word processing, graphics or education, I think SDN is worth
investigating.  The phone number for The DUCK Pond is (205) 822-0956.
First-time users are allotted 30 minutes and can download up to 300k.
Registered users get 120 minutes and a 3 MEG download limit per day.

A Review of Norton Commander 3.0
by Mike Tyner

     Every now and then, a piece of software comes along that makes
itself indispensable. One such program is Norton Commander. NC is a
directory program and application launcher which nearly eliminates the
need to know DOS commands. NC version 3.0 is available mail-order for
about $55, is not copy-protected, and works with DOS 2.0 and above.

     For the novice user, NC shortens the DOS learning curve immensely.
After introducing several beginners to it, I find they need about two
minutes to learn what directories are and how to navigate them. After 10
minutes, they can copy, move, delete, and edit files with ease.

     For advanced users, NC saves time and keystrokes. There are other
shell programs and directory guides, with diehard user bases. And there
are some users who will refuse to quit pounding out "CD \". This article
is for the rest. It reviews the highlights of NC version 3.0, released
in October, 1989.

     NC 3.0 occupies only 13008 bytes of main memory. It prefers to be
the last file loaded by AUTOEXEC. When loaded, it displays two
independent DOS directories in panels on each half of the screen. The
familiar C: prompt remains at the bottom of the screen, ready for typed
commands, which are seldom necessary. NC is designed to run full-time
underneath other programs, and runs with no open files: it does not need
to be exited before the computer is turned off. An integral
screen-blanker (with a pleasant twist) can be set for different
intervals or defeated.

     Parent directories are identified by ".." at the top of each
listing, and subdirectories are capitalized. A cursor highlights one
file or a group of files, and the file is launched by pressing <Enter>
on the highlighted file. Pressing <Enter> on a parent or subdir entry
displays the contents of that directory. A menu bar at the bottom of the
screen labels the function keys, which NC uses heavily. If NC finds a
mouse driver, the mouse can be used to highlight files and select
functions.

     Applications can be started from either panel, and the TAB key or
mouse will switch from panel to panel. When the application finishes, NC
resumes at exactly the same point. Either or both panels can be switched
off. Directories in either display can be sorted by name, size, time, or
unsorted with simple commands. The displays can be brief, showing only
filenames, or full, showing size, time, and date. In the brief display,
the bottom line of each panel shows size, time, and date for the file
under the cursor. One panel can be dedicated as a "Tree" display,
showing the user exactly where the displayed directory is in the overall
disk structure.

     Function keys F1-F10 are used to edit, view, move, copy, and delete
files. F1 calls a hypertext help system. F3 safely displays the contents
of ANY file, in ASCII or HEX, wrapped or unwrapped. The function keys
are relabeled for search and display options. F4 similarly displays any
file, with the added ability to edit the file. (This makes batch files
and BBS messages a breeze!) Text and program files are viewed or edited
by overlaying the included program WPVIEW.EXE. NC 3.0 also includes
viewers for WordStar and other formats, selected at installation, or you
can choose your own such as QEdit, E88, or Blackbeard.

     If F3 is pressed on a Lotus file, a different viewer is overlaid,
displaying the file formatted and totalled as it would appear in Lotus.
If the file is a .DBF file, the viewer DBFVIEW pages through the dBase
file record by record. If the file has a .PCX extension, PCXVIEW will be
called, displaying the graphic as PC Paintbrush would show it. Are you
impressed yet? Wait... there's more...

     If the user presses <Enter> on a non-executable file, NC politely
does nothing. But NC accepts definitions in an "extension" log, which
will run the application you choose based on the extension of the chosen
file. I set up a definition for ZIP files, so that when I press <Enter>
on any zip file anywhere, NC runs PKUNZIP to unpack it into the
directory C:\COMM\ARC\WORK. If I press <Enter> on a Lotus worksheet, it
runs 123 with that sheet loaded. If I press <Enter> on a .FOX program,
Foxbase runs that application. In this way, NC becomes a true
"point-and- shoot" directory manager.

     F2 is a menu key. NC allows one or multiple "user menus" to be
defined. For the absolute beginner, this menu system makes navigation
foolproof. For the power user, it starts any application with one or two
keys, from any directory.

     F5, F6, and F8 move, copy, and delete, either the single file under
the cursor, or multiple files highlighted with the <Ins> key or right
mouse button. F7 creates a subdirectory (F8 will delete a highlighted
directory if empty). NC asks for confirmation on all destructive
operations and actions on multiple files.

     F9 is the configuration key, calling a pull-down menu system of
general options and commands, or independent settings for each panel.
F10 removes NC from memory completely.

     The <Alt> key reassigns several function keys for miscellaneous
tasks. <Alt>-F7 performs a directory search. <Alt>- F8 calls up a
command history, where previous commands (typed or generated by NC) can
be chosen with a menu bar. F10 generates a full-screen Tree display so
directories can be chosen with the cursor.

     My favorite is <Alt>-F9: it switches between 25- and 50-line VGA
display. NC handles EGA and VGA nicely, and it's awesome to see nearly
300 files neatly sorted and organized every time I exit to DOS. I'll
never "CD" again!

ProDoor 3.1 of 10-08-89;
Copyright (C) 1987, 1989 Samuel H. Smith
by Ricky Morgan


                           ProDoor Utilities

     I hope at this point that everyone who has had the perseverance to
wade through all these articles has learned something about ProDoor.
This is the last installment, I promise. There are just a few commands
that I would like to cover and then I will return you to your regularly
scheduled BTN.

     (H)otkeys!    [on/off]

     This is a neat little command that allows instant response to your
typing.  You don't have to press ENTER after each command. When you
select Hotkeys, you have block cursor pop up in place of the regular
cursor. This is to remind you that you are in Hotkey mode.

     From this point on, ProDoor will respond to any letter you type.
You will have to remember not to hit the space bar if you are stacking
commands. The space bar will act just like pressing ENTER. To stack
commands you would just use a semi-colon instead.

       F;1;ns           To list file directory 1 in non stop mode.

     If you don't want to stack the commands, just type the letter of
the command you want and press Enter, space or wait a second or two and
ProDoor will automatically initiate the command for you.

     Hotkeys are good for people too lazy to hit enter.

     (M)ode          [graphics]

     This mode should be fairly self explanatory. It turns the ANSI
graphics capabilities of ProDoor (and PCBoard) on and off. If you have
ANSI capabilities I recommend at least looking at the graphics of the
board you are on from time to time. There are some talented people out
there and some real great graphics.

     (X)pert  [menu on/off]

     This turns the full screen menu on and off.  With the menu on,
after each command you get a full listing of the Main menu. Then, as you
issue the commands, you will receive prompting for choices. In the
Message section you will have a two line prompt to remind you of your
choices:

(?)help,    (S)ince-last,  (+)next,  (-)prior,  (J)oin-topic,  (NS)non-stop,
(N)o more,  (Q)uick-scan,  (RE)ply,  (X)pert,   (Z)ip-search,  (H)otkeys!

     With Expert off, you are on your own and must rely on memory for
the commands. You can toggle expert on and off at any main command
prompt.

     How about <Elsewhere>?

     This is for areas that are generally outside of ProDoor.

     (LIB)rary disks

     This is for the larger systems that have extra storage areas, (such
as CD ROM disks), for storing files. If the system supports Library disk
follow the prompts. If the system doesn't support the function you will
be prompted: (LIB) Function is not supported.

     (OPEN) other doors

     This is how you got into ProDoor in the beginning. Some systems
have all sorts of DOORS. Game doors, Caller Verification Doors, Mail
Doors, the list goes on and on. This command simply allows you to move
from one door to another without going back to PCBoard first.

     (QUIT) to BBS

     This returns you to PCBoard.

     (G)oodbye [logoff]:

     This command logs you out of ProDoor and off the system. You do not
have to exit ProDoor to quit off the system.

     That about wraps it up people. I hope you have enjoyed these at
least a little and that a few of you have learned something. Enjoy!

G

Thank you for using ProDoor, Ricky.

                                     telecomputing harmony with a global BBS

The single accomplishment of which I am most proud is: Getting thru High
     School and getting enough scholarships to carry me thru college.

My favorite performers are: U2, Mr. Mister, The Independant Presbyterian
                            Church Choir (NOTE: that is not my home church,
                            I am Baptist)

The last good movie I saw was: Parenthood

The last good book I read was: Hmmmmm. I read The Satanic Verses for my
                   English research paper in January, but I just finished
                   reading Ringworld and The Ringworld Engineers by
                   Larry Niven

If they were making a movie of my life, I'd like to see my part played by:
      No one, they couldn't do a good job.

My pet peeves are: Crazy drivers, and people who do not care when they
                   should

When nobody's looking, I like to:  Pick my nose, eat pork Chitlin's and
                         be a good ole' Southern boy (That was for you,
                         Dean) [Really, I like a good nap as well as the
                         next guy]

Book Review with
Karsten Propper

     The book I shall be reviewing is called "Prince of Whales" by R.L.
Fisher.

     The book is about, as you may have guessed from the title, whales.
You find out that are different types of whales. There are regular
whales and dream singers, whales that sing their song while asleep. Most
dream singers are outcasts, as was young Toby.

     He was a dream singer, and all whales thought he would attract the
iron beasts, or whaling ships, with his singing, or maybe even sharks.
So, Toby was put on trial, whether to be forced to leave the herd, or
stay with them. They could come to no decision, so Toby had to make it
for himself.

     And he did just that, Toby decided to leave, to brave all the
dangers of the mysterious sea and go out on his own. He would run into
more interesting troubles than anyone could imagine. Before he left, he
had a talk with his aunt, the head of the council, and she said that he
must find his true voice. Only then could he come back to the herd.

     This begins a new era for Toby, as he meets many an interesting
creature on his voyage. For instance, he meets a crab who is slowly
dying from the pressure at that low a depth. He meets four killer whales
who take him to a dance club. They ask him to work for them because of
his beautiful voice.

     Through working at the club, he plays for prestigious people. He
also finds out the origin of his dream singing. It is the dream master,
a creature not really considered as anything. He's not a whale, a crab,
an orka or anything, just his own species.

     He's very powerful, and he invades dreams, trying to suck the life
out out of anything whose dreams he can invade. Well, the story goes
into Toby's fight between the dream master, millions of people who want
to kill the whales, and himself. It is a very emotional and touchy book
at that stage, and was very enjoyable.

     I don't want to give it all away, so find out who wins. You really
enjoy the book.

Boards with a "*" before their name are members of our local network,
EzNet, and public messages left in the EzNet Conferences of any of these
boards will be echoed to all members.

Boards with a "+" before their name are members of FidoNet, an
international network that provides a variety of public forums as well
as private mail services all over the world.

EzNet Multiple Echo List

     EzNet now supports multiple conference echoing but there are a few
things you should be aware of regarding private mail.

  A. You have one 'address' for private mail.  If you are registered for
     private mail on Channel 8250 and someone sends you a private
     message in the MS-DOS conference from Crunchy Frog it will wind
     up in the Hardware conference on Channel 8250 as it should.

     However, if you were registered for private mail on Magnolia and
     someone sends you a private message in a conference that Magnolia
     does not support (echo) then the message will wind up in the
     twilight zone.

  B. If you go by a handle on one BBS and your real name on another even
     if the private message goes where it is supposed to, you will not
     be able to read it because it is addressed to someone else as far
     as PC Board is concerned.  PC Board has no way of knowing that Red
     Foxx and John Doe are the same person. No tickee, no washee.

     Advice on sending private mail: If you don't know if the person you
are sending private mail to is registered for private mail then keep a
copy of the message in case you have to find an alternate route. EzNet
Central will delete your private, undelivered message and inform you
that the user you attempted to reach is not registered for private mail
on any EzNet Node.

     This is a list of the current echoes that I am aware of.  More are
in the making and will be posted in future issues.  If you are a sysop
and are running an echo not listed for your board, please make us aware
of it so we may correct it next issue.
