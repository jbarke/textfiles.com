Error Messages Made Easy To Understand
--------------------------------------

All ATM machines have a 3 digit code, when a machine goes down, or the power
supply is interupted, or the host system pulls the machine down, you will get
this nice friendly screen:

ATM TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE
PLEASE TRY ANOTHER LOCATION

xxx         Mpact

If you take a little time to read the following codes, you WILL know what is
happening.  Also, ALMOST, not all, BUT almost, all machines, are serviced by
the institution that the machine is from, your own bank may have about 10 or so
machines throughout town, and they WILL say the name of the institution on it.
Anyways, the institution has a person, or several ( depending on size of the
institution ) people that serve the machine ( Gives Slavery a new twist does
it? ), anyways, the machine will send out an error code, which is echoed to the
screen for the INSTITUTIONS needs, and generaly there IS a person either on
their way, or they are there already, so watch around for people when you are
looking at these machines.  Also depending on which "Network" ( Mpact / Pulse
/ Cirus etc, ), there will be a service that will call the Bank and
notify the Mpact "Cooridinator", which is in charge of the ATM department at
said bank, and they will come to the machine, or send someone to the machine,
or depending on the codes listed below, may not send anyone at all.

THREE LETTER CODE ON ATM "OUT OF SERVICE":

AAA -- The ATM is down by host command in response to a fault or a supply out
       status.*

CCC -- The host computer is out of service.**

DDD -- The ATM is not being polled due to a communications failure.

EEE -- The ATM supply switch is on.*

*   -- EEE is displayed in the lower right-hand corner when the Supply switch
       is on.  When the switch is turned off, AAA is displayed until the
       "go in service" command is received from the host.

**  -- CCC can also be displayed if the ATM is not being polled.  This occurs
       when polling stops during a customer transaction.

Without going into to much detail, the following list which ranges from code
#600 - #684, contains the codes that are reflected when a machine goes down,
and you are forced to look at the stupid message, just look at the code at/near
the bottom of the screen, and look down this list.  The code will be like this:

                     ---------------------------------------
                     -                                     -

Well that is it, now if you EVER are at an ATM machine and you see the
Temporarily Out Of Service, just scan for the Triple Letter/Triple # code and
you'll be more educated, probably, than the person that will eventually show
up to fix the problem.
