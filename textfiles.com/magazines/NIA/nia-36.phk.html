                        :    Otherwise Known As CBI   :
                        HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM<

I would like to say that in a recent issue of Hackers Unlimited, The Dark Lord,
wrote a file entitled, CBI's.  After laughing my way through it, I thought I
better correct the damage he has done, before someone ( Apollo? maybe yes
and then maybe no ) attempts and or believes the CRAP he wrote.

In the first paragraph The Dark Lord, here on out mentioned as HE, states
that "THESE ARE AS TOUCHY (DANGEROUS) TO USE AS TRW'S BUT JUST AS MUCH FUN",
this small little statement is a joke, w/ the correct information, you could
log onto the CBI's dialup during regular business hours, without ever being
bothered about it.  Better yet, think of it this way, as you may/may not
know Folyes ( Of Course! ), has an Instant Credit Plan, where they will
generally nine out of ten times, give you a Foleys Charge Carde, right there
on the spot, well they take your information that you just filled out, and
run into another office, where someone enters the information and dials up
the Credit Bureau ( CBI or TRW ), and enters in the information, and based
there you are either approved or denied.  Remember this if you are EVER
denied a Credit Card, Charge Card or something like that, based on your
credit rating, you have up to 60 days ( they upped it from 30 a few months
ago ), to see your credit report, quite a handy trick, to piss off people,
and besides you have the right to know and SEE the report.  But the point I
am trying to make here ( sorry for the tangent there ), is that Foleys,
state wide, offers instant Credit through CBI or TRW's Credit Reporting
Services, if you ever been to a Foleys, you will know that there are
literally THOUSANDS of people attempting to get credit, and this is STATE
WIDE, so I would assume the number is much much higher, but THINK, if you
stay with business hours, and you had Foleys account, password, user name
and password, you could pull reports all day long, AND NEVER WORRY ABOUT
BEING BUSTED.  They don't trace calls, which to my knowledge, no one has
ever mentioned about it.

"THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR CARDERS.  IT IS A WAY TO FIND A PERSON THAT IS
RICH, AND GET THE INFOR THAT YOU NEED ON THEM, AND THE GET THERE CARD AND
CHARGE, CHARGE, CHAGE!"

Again HE, makes yet another stupid mistake, you can do NOTHING on the system
without the following bits of information:

NAME ( Must Have )
STREET ADDRESS ( Must Have )
CITY ( Must Have )
STATE ( Must Have )
ZIP ( Must Have )
SOCIAL ( Optional )
EMPLOYMENT ( Optional )
SPOUSE ( Optional )

You can not just dial up CBI or TRW and enter the Account # and go ok, where
is a rich person, unless you KNOW that Joe Blow is wealthy, you can not do
to much till you have someones name and address.

When I read the file I got the impression that he was attempting to say that
CBI's is a computer system, well it IS NOT.  It IS though, a Business, and
if you care to know, and maybe you should, so that you could point out the
fact that CBI stands for The Credit Bureau, Incorporated of Georgia, they
are located ( obviously ) in Georgia, here is the complete address, in case
you care to write to them:

                                  CBI/EQUIFAX
                           1600 PEACHTREE STREE, N.W.
                               ATLANTA, GA 30309
                                 (404) 885-8000

Ok, next part, of his "file" is the actual pulling of information, which he
states:

"1. YOU WILL CALL AND GET A CONNECTION.  MOST CBIS WILL BE 300 BAUD AND YOU
WILL NEED THE SETTINGS OF 7-E-1."

This is pretty much almost correct, if you have a 1200 BPS system you will
need to Carriage Return only three times to get it activated, two times at
300 BPS.  Remeber if you CONNECT 1200 hit your enter key THREE TIMES, if you
CONNECT 300, hit your enter key TWICE.  You should have no problems with
that, the system will say SIGN ON, so you should not have to worry about
that.


"2. YOU WILL NEED TO CARRAGE RETURN THREE TIMES.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THAT
HIT CTROL-S FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER RETURN."

In all actuallity refer to line # one, wait till you see a little message
that says:

"SIGN ON"

That message means that you are logged onto the Credit Bureau, and their
system is now awaiting for the signon information.

>From there you will need the following bits of information that are friend
sort have left out:

COMPANY ACCOUNT (10 Alphanumeric in length)
USER PW
USER NAME


Well, the format is say for example "XXXXXXXXXX-KK,JOE,Z. (RETURN) CONTROL-S"

I will think that will help you slightly more then the method as described
by the original writer.

"3.  ENTER THE ACCOUNT.  THEN ENTER ANOTHER CTRL-S.  AFTER THAT INPUT THE
LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, THEN THE MIDDLE INITIAL."

Wrong, there is a format in which you enter the users information, you can
NOT just enter the name and get stuff, you have to use the following format,
if you mess up 3 times in a row, you get kicked off.

NM-LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME,MIDDLE.(ENTER)
CA-#,STREET,DESIGNATION,CITY,STATE,ZIPCODE. (ENTER)
ID-SSS-XXX-XX-XXX. (ENTER)
CONTROL-S

NA = Name
CA = Current Address
ID-SSS = Social Security Number

You might have noticed that there are periods at the end of each line, well
if you don't add those, the system will NOT know that you are finished
inputing information. Also you may noticed that ENTER is used, but then so
is CONTROL-S, Control S is what the Enter Key is to us, so be sure you USE
that control S, which basically means SEND, that tells there system, that
you Entered all the information and you are ready to SEND and then RECEIVE
your information.

"4.  HIT A RETURN AND WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS (5-10)"

You don't need this step at all, stupid.

"5.  ENTER THE ADDRESS, APT NUM. ETC..., CITY THEN THE STATE AND LAST BUT
NOT LEAST THE ZIPCOME.  THE STATE MUST BE AN ABREVIATION."

"6.  ONCE AGAIN HIT THE CONTROL-S AND YOU CAN WORK IT FROM THERE, DOING WHAT
YOU NEED TO WITH THE CARD."

Lines five and six, go together, which if you followed it, you would have
been logged off many times, and thus arrising suspicion on the CBI side.

If you enter the information correctly as stated in line number three, you
will have no problem.


Conclusion:

The rest of the file is trash, I know I don't have any accounts to give you,
I am sorry, but now you know more of what to look for, you now have enough
information to gather before you attempt to do something.

Again, this is a reason why people get into trouble, because they are
reading files that ARE WRONG.  The information in HACKERS' UNLIMITED, FILE
CBI's is wrong, do NOT go by it, I have stated here, why, how, and what to
look for, and I will also give you a promise to come out with another report
on how to READ CBI's, and just for your own peace of mind, if you have my
other file on TRW's format, its NOT much different then that.

Thanks To:

Judge Dredd : "GOT, you know this stuff, correct him, NOW!"
The Dark Lord: With out him, this file could NOT have been possible
Lord Kalkin: Hey guy how is Germany??
Chester The M0lester: "When are you guy's going to come out with another
                      "Issue, I'm WAITING".
