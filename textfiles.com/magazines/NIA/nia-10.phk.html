Well if you want to know what South Western Bell is sending people,  well
here is your chance to see.  I got this "manual" which is not a true
informative book, this is the kind of stuff they send to people to get you
into buying their stuff.

So word for word here is the manual that was sitting on my desk the other
morning, its for your INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:

Plexar is a flexible telephone system specifically designed to meet your
business communications needs.

Although Plexar is a very sophisticated telephone system,  it is very
simple to use.  Plexar uses the central computers at the Southwestern Bell
Telephone switching office that work directly with your Touch-tone
telephones.   That means no additional phone equipment needs to be leased
or bought in order to enjoy the many services of Plexar.    You have no
capital investment and no maintenance expenses.    You simply lease Plexar
on a month-to-month basis.

And as your business grow,  Plexar can grow with you.    Optional features (
listed in the back of this manual)  may be added to your phone system
without having to add any additional equipment.

Please read the information that follows,  for an easy understanding of
how your Plexar system works.    Then you can begin to enjoy the
conveniences of this intelligent telephone system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

LEARNING TO USE PLEXAR:

There are two important sources you can use to familiarize yourself with
Plexar.

One is this manual.

The other is the small desk-top reference booklet with which you have been
provided.  Both offer easy access and abbreviated instructions.

Should you ever have additional questions,  your Southwestern Bell
Telephone service representative is always available to help you learn to
use your Plexar system or just to give you a quick refresher course.
Just call your local Southwestern Bell Telephone Business Service Center.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

THE SWITCHHOOK AND DIAL TONES

Located on the top of your phone,  under the receiver,  are plastic posts
or a tab called switchhooks (or switch buttons).  Ordinarily,  the
switchhooks are what disconnect a call when you hang up the phone.    But
with the Plexar system,  the switchhook becomes one of your key
communication links.  When you have used your switchhook to activate
Plexar Features, it will give you audible tones so you will know whether
you should proceed with your call.  Some phones use the flash or recall
button instead of the switchhook.  You should familiarize yourself with
these simple tones so you can quickly and easily take advantage of the
Plexar system.

DIAL TONE - A single,  steady uninterrupted tone that you hear when you
            release the switchhook of a phone.

RECALL DIAL TONE - A stutter dial tone consisting of three short beeps and
                   then a continuous dial tone that you hear after
                   depressing and releasing either switchhook for
                   approximately one second.  Used in this manner,  the
                   switchhook allows you to switch calls (engaging and
                   disengaging existing calls)  to other lines without ever
                   fully disconnecting them.

it is important that you depress and release a switchhook the correct
length of time.  Otherwise you could accidentally disconnect a call.  But
this is an easily acquired knack.   Just a little practice,  and you will be
using the switchhook correctly whenever whenever you need.

CONFIRMATION TONE - Two Short tones followed by a continuous dial tone
                    confirms that the phone function you are activating has
                    taken place and you should proceed.

REORDER TONE - A continuous series of tones (fast busy) indicating that
your call is temporarily blocked.   You should try again later.

If you have any problem locating the switchhook on your telephone,  call
your local Business Service Center for assistance.

------------------------------------------------------------------

THE * AND # BUTTONS

The * and # buttons (located on the phone dial) are integral parts of the
Plexar system.  When pressed in the correct sequence,  they allow you to
"assign" phone calls to other telephone lines in your system.  They also
allow you to access the many convenient features of the Plexar system.

Together, these special buttons and the switchhook are the foundation of
your Plexar system.  The switchhook engages and disengages calls from your
phone,  and the special buttons assign the calls to various lines and give
you access to system features.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

INTER-OFFICE CALLING (INTERCOM CALLING)

This allows you to call other Plexar telephones in your office,  using an
abbreviated code.

TO CALL ANOTHER PLEXAR STATION:

1. Lift receiver,  and listen for a dial tone.
2. Dial * and the appropriate 2 digit station code.

The station codes cover numbers 20 - 49,  inclusive, each of which is the
abbreviated code for one of the seven digit telephone numbers in your
Plexar system.  The two digit codes were assigned at the time you Plexar
service was ordered.

NOTE:  You do not need to use the switchhook in this instance,  because
you do not engage or disengage an incoming call.  You simply need the *
button to assign your call to the desired station.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

HOLD A CALL

you are on the phone with someone, and you wish to put that person on hold.

TO HOLD A CALL:

1. Depress and release the switchhook within one second.  Don't keep the
switchhook depressed for more than 2 seconds.  Otherwise you will
disconnect your call.

2. Listen for the Recall Dial Tone (stutter dial tone).
3. Dial * 0.  Don't hang up - you are caller is now on hold and can not

conversation.

TO ALTERNATE:

If you are at your desk and you hear another telephone ringing nearby,
you can pick up the call from your phone.

TO PICK UP A CALL FROM YOUR PHONE:

1.  Lift receiver and listen for the dial tone.
2.  Dial * 7.
3.  Then Talk.

The call will be directed to your phone the instant you touch * 7.  So be

phone call intended for someone else.

Remember, when you pick up a call, it becomes your call and is no longer
on the telephone at the nearby desk.  You can handle the call like any
other call to your phone: transfer it, add a third party, etc.

NOTE:  at larger companies, you have the ability to assign call pick-up
groups when you order your service.  This allows you to selectively pick
up calls from only those phones in your designated pick-up group.

hold your call and answer the ringing phone.
