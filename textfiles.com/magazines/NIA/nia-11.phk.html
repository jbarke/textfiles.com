                           PREFACE AND CHAPTER 1

APRIL 1988

This Manual provides the basic concepts and procedures for VMS system
management; it is especially intended for managers of small clusters and
systems.

PREFACE

The VMS SYSTEM MANAGER'S MANUAL provides system managers with the concepts and
procedures needed to manage daily operations on a VMS system.  This manual
contains a subset of information included in the Extended VMS System
managements documentation subkit.

INTENDED AUDIENCE

This manual can be used by anyone who performs the functions of a system
manager or operator on a VMS system.  It is especially intended for managers of
small clusters and systems.

Document Structure

The VMS SYSTEM MANAGER'S MANUAL is divided into two main sections:  System
Management Tasks and Reference.

Part I ( Chapters 1 through 11 ) are task-oriented descriptions of the
functions that are generally assigned to system managers.  Part II, the
Reference section, documents the utilities that serve as system management
tools on a VMS system.

Chapter 1 describes each chapter in some detail.  REad Chapter 1 to determine
which of the remaining chapters in the book are appropriate for your needs.

The Reference section contains quick reference information on the VMS system
management utilities.  Each utility chapter includes a usage summary and a
subset of frequently use commands and qualifiers.

The Reference section includes the following utilities:

:  Accounting Utility
:  Analyze/Disk_Structure Utility
:  Authorize Utility
:  Backup Utility
:  Bad Block Locator Utility
:  Error Log Utility
:  Exchange Utility
:  Install Utility
:  LAT Control Program Utility
:  Mount Utility
:  Network Control Program ( NCP ) Utility
:  SYSGEN Utility
:  SYSMAN Utility
:  Terminal Fallback Utility

The VMS operating system and the other software products that run on your
computer provide you and the other users on your system with a wide range of
computing capabilities.  In order to create and maintain a proper and
efficient computing environment, certain administrative tasks must be
undertaken.  These tasks are called SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, and they include the
following:

: Setting up the system
: Giving individual users access to the system
: Installing software (and software updates)
: Managing acceptable performance levels
: Preventing the loss of important information that you keep on line
: Making sure that the system is secure
: Handling media (such as disks/magnetic tapes)
: setting up the software to allow for printers and for batch jobs
: Setting up a cluster
: Setting up a network

As system manager, you may need to do some of these tasks only once (for
example, setting up software to allow for printers or batch jobs, or setting
up a network); others are done on a continuing basis (for example, maintaining
system security and preventing the loss of data).  At some sites, one or more
people are designated as SYSTEM MANAGERS, and other individuals are designated
as OPERATORS.  In these cases, operators are responsible for tasks such as
physically mounting magnetic tapes and disks, monitoring printers, responding
to emergencies or security alarms, and maintaining system log files.

Not all of the tasks described in this manual may be necessary for your site.
This chapter provides an overview of the information that this manual
contains.  You should read this introductory chapter to determine which parts
of the manual may be applicable to your site.

1.2  SYSTEM MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND TERMS

Some concepts and terms are used frequently in system management, and you
should become familiar with them.  The following terms and concepts are used
both in the context of everyday general use in a VMS system and in the context
of system management; they are described in the VMS GENERAL USER'S MANUAL:

:  Accounts and directories
:  Command Procedures
:  Digital Command Language (DCL)

The following concepts and terms apply primarily to system management:

:  SYSTEM account and [SYSMGR] directory

   The SYSTEM account is reserved for use by the system manager.  When you
   are logged into the SYSTEM ACCOUNT, your default directory (Which is also
   reserved for the system manager) is SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR].

   Always be careful when you are logged into the SYSTEM account.  When you
   are logged into the SYSTEM account, all privileges are enabled, by default.
   You need these privileges to perform many system management tasks; however,
   they can also produce unwanted or even destructive results if you use them
   carelessly.

:  CONSOLE (OPERATOR'S) TERMINAL

   You can perform most system management tasks from any terminal that is
   connected to the processor (or the cluster).  However, certain tasks such
   as bootstrapping the system and communicating with the VAX processor's
   console subsystem must be performed at a special terminal called the
   CONSOLE TERMINAL.

   The console terminal, which always has the designation OPA0, is also
   usually designated as the OPERATOR'S TERMINAL.  You use the operator's
   terminal to send messages to system users and respond to user requests,
   using the operator communication process (OPCOM).
