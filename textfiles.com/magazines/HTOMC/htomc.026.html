                   Divinely Inspired Comics

**** A-Bomb #2 - Lots of very explicit, manga-style adult cartoons. Why is it
that the characters in so many of these stories are drawn in "Archies" style?
Maybe there's a message there...  Plus, a couple of gender-bending stories
by Donna Barr.  This series is better than a stack of Aircel's, although not
as intense as Cherry or Demi.  Venus Comics.

*** Bangs and the Gang #1 - After the high-school sitcom is cancelled, Bangs
is nearly gang-banged by the entire cast.  She escapes, only to unintentionally
go from one scandalous orgy to the next.  Extremely explicit, with stories
done by Felipe Gru, Chuck Austen of "Strips", and more.  Shhwing Comics.

*** Beavis & Butthead #3 - Escaped convicts are no match for the boys, as the
bad guys become entangled in the dangerous chaos of Burger World.  Plus, they
wreck Home Economics class while making brownies.  The pranks page is a review
of standard bathroom gags, like M-80s, plastic wrap, etc.  Marvel Comics.

**** The Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Prequel to the "Mishkin File", by Kim
and Simon Deitch. This one follows the story of early cartoon animators, and
the tragic story of Ted Mishkin, in their unmistakable style.  These stories
really do evoke the wonder of watching cartoons as a young kid.  Fantagraphics

*** Buck Godot #2 - In this outer-space adventure, Buck is a large, rough
humanoid employed as a bodyguard.  At a party at the space station, Buck
destroys a robot auctioning information among humanity's enemies, and prepares
for a riot at the main ceremony.  Drawn by Phil Foglio, Palliard Press

**** Crap #3 - Milton meets the drag queen who hosts the low-budget horror
movie show, interviews him, and gets to know why female impersonators do it,
and how they feel about it.  Plus, Milton gets the chance to break down some
of his roommates' hangups and misconceptions.  Plus, a neat comic telling 
all about the great northwest, and the people there.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Duplex Planet Illustrated #6 - An interesting, but tame, set of stream-of-
consciousness stories by David Greenberger, with artwork by Moriarty, Wayno,
and others.  I liked the one-page "Baldness", and "What's More Important-
Romance or Food?".  Some stories are a bit repetitive.  Fantagraphics Books

*** Adventures of Fat Freddy's Cat, book 1 - Lots of fairly old, but still
good, tales of the original cat-with-an-attitude, and his scatological revenge
on those who abuse him.  Rip Off Press.

*** Insomnia - by Andrew Moran - A man who hasn't been able to sleep for 17
years drives across the country to seek medical help.  Along the way, he buys
a doll which turns out to be a real, live girl, whom he rescued from abuse.
After resolving past problems, he gets relief.  Fantagraphics Books 

**** Jim vol 2 #1 - Theseare a couple of great -and long- stories from JIm
Woodring.  The first one, in color, is an adventure with the disgusting and
repulsive Manhog.  After receiving a nasty head injury, he is tortured by
hallucinations and disfigures himself in a fit of stupidity.  The book is
well worth it for this story alone.  The other story is one of Jim's dreams,
of a hard-luck artist on a temple construction project.  Fantagraphics Books

*** Negative Burn #8 - One of my favorites of this series, it has several
Classics Desecrated, plus Boneshaker III, Mr. Mamoulian, and other stories.
"Little Neil in Slumberland" by James Owen is neat.  Caliber Press.

**** Negative Burn #9 - Nope, this one is the best.  Every story in it is
hard-hitting and great, from "Dominique- Size" to the "Twilight People",
and much more.  With sketchbook by Dave Dorman, there is more -and better-
material in this one than any other.  Caliber Press.

*** Post Brothers #35 - The truth finally comes out - Jeri was the one who
erased Russ's tapes, and Boche was the one who actually killed her father.
Also, alien mutants break into the warehouse, seeking revenge on Ron, and Big
Ed removes all his safety spells on Bugtown as revenge on Russ. Rip Off Press

*** Pressed Tongue #1 - by Dave Cooper - This comic reminds me a lot of Crumb's
style, along with the disgusting characters.  A perverted building super who
spies on all the tenants with hidden cameras finds that one couples baby's
shit will cure his gross sores.  Fantagraphics Books.

** Radioactive Man #2 - This is a spoof on super-heroes, using Simpson's
characters.  Homer is the Radioactive Man, and Bart is his sidekick, Fallout
Boy.  Although the story is filled with some sly and subtle jokes, perhaps the
best part is the inside-cover parody of all those ads in old comics peddling
x-ray glasses, spy telescopes and other junk.  Bongo Comics.

*** Real Stuff #16 - continues with Dennis Eichhorn's real-life adventures,
as drawn by different artists.  This one has part 2 of the Wild Man Fisher
story, fraternity pranks, drunken teenage scrapes with the law (by Chester
Brown & Sook-Yin Lee) and Vancouver BC eco-terrorists.  Although the one story
tended to glorify the environmentalists blowing up factories and attacking
various non-politically-correct targets, they look like little more than
left-wing Nazis to me.  Good stories, though.  Fantagraphics Books

*** Ren & Stimpy #18 - R&S go to war; when surrounded by enemy troops, Ren
uses a secret weapon: Stimpy's belches and farts.  After capturing all the
enemy troops, they are rewarded with an awful chicken comic in a USO show,
which they can't escape no matter how hard they try.  Also in this issue,
Powdered Toast Man, meets the girl of his dreams, the Weezi-Bake Oven Girl.
Nearly as many ads as there are story pages in this issue.  Marvel Comics.

** Sally Forth #3 - An amusing story, but for an Eros comic, its long on story
and short on erotica- which consists of a large-but-gravity-defying-breasted
woman getting her clothes destroyed as often as possible.  A tiny republic
is building a robot army to conquer the world, and an army group, with Sally,
is sent in to investigate.  Eros Comics

*** Spotlight on the Genius that is Joe Sacco - this is an anthology of Joe's
earlier works, most of which were printed in smaller, forgotten collections.
There's a variety of different stories, including the Edwin Smallcabbage
story that ran in Suburban High Life.  A few gems in here. Fantagraphics Books

** War Sluts #1 - Actually, there's a pretty good story to it- in an alternate
Reality, WWII never ended, and a german biological program backfired- creating
a race of super-strong and powerful valkyries.  Naturally, they are blonde,
large-breated, and scantily clad, as one of the Slut Fleet heroes goes to the
moon to retrive an artifact.  The action could be a bit more credible, and the
artwork didn't do that much for me.  Pretty Graphic Comix.

*** Vamperotica #1 - 3 stories for those who want more than the subtle erotica
in the original story.  Hot stories, although not too explicit, with some
interesting plot twists, but basically its variations on the theme of: vampire
girl meets guy, screws guy, and drinks his blood.  Brainstorm Comics.

                ZINES sacrificed to the Sacred PO Box

Asylum for Shut-Ins #2 - The direct, church-approved continuation of the
High Weirdness by Mail concept, continues with its second awe-inspiring issue.
Great rant-like reviews of organizations that deserve it (I've even used AFA
material in *exactly* the same way myself...)  They list all sorts of
political/religious/conspiracy/etc. groups that take themselves and their
worldviews a bit too seriously, plus great publications, catalogs, music, and
updates to HWbM listings.  This is a must-have.  $9/year, $10 in Canada.
>>>>>>>>  PO Box 46581, Bedford OH  44146  <<<<<<<<<<

Ambassador Report - I don't know how in hell these people got my address, but
their newsletter was fun anyway.  It turns out that one of the latest slackless
"churches", namely Herbert Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God (you know- the
ones who run that doom-and-gloom "The World Tomorrow" show), is splintering
into a zillion different sects, each with its own view toward controversial
doctrine issues large and small.  Not surprising- this is even happening to
the Scientologists.  The newsletter goes on to list page after page of schizmed
groups and their antics, including one whose minister received a "prophecy"
that the local BMW dealer was going to donate a car.  They didn't.  Tons of
unintentional yuks here.  No price listed, PO Box 60068, Pasadena, CA  91116  

The Bureau of Control - They sent a couple of great pamphlets - the first is
a GREAT little SubGenius tract made up to look just like one of Jack Chick's.
Every page is filled with inspirational graphics and mind-opening dialogue.
The other one, "State of the Art", is a long and scathing look at the crap
that makes up modern "art", and the mindset that goes with it, juxtaposed with
Army biological warfare educational material.  I liked the Chinese Hell money
too, probably from Archie McPhee.  18210 Blanchmont, Houston TX  77058

Bovine Gazette vol. 2 #9 - In a tribute to Heidi Fleiss, this issue has a
couple of articles looking into what kind of women are prostitutes, and what
kind of men are likely to seek their services. It really reveals how fucked-up
the standard "morality" is toward such people.  Plus, a long "Adventures of
Prof. Slug" cartoon, and a couple of others.  $1 or $5/6 issues from
Mad Dog Productions, PO Box 2263, Pasadena CA 91102

DystOpinion #16 - by Wangifesto Press, reviews and articles from the Seattle
perspective. Everything from bands, comics, zines, and books are reviewed.
They do a very insightful comparison of two of my favorite comic artists, Dan
Clowes & Peter Bagge.  I can definitely agree with the hostility toward the
"corporate" mentality creeping into the "alternative" or "underground" scene,
but be careful of the "slave to anti-fashion" trap.  PO Box 45622, Seattle, WA
98145-0622 or rwang@elwha.evergreen.edu. Lots of stuff not seen anywhere else.

Lost Armadillos in Heat - This is a zine put out by a whole bunch of people in
Austin, Texas, which, if you've ever been there, is quite unlike any other
place in Texas.  This is a neat place, with great bars (the Dog & Duck was
fantastic) and fun people.  This is also where Slacker was filmed.  This zine
is a collection of rants, articles, various columns, and lots of cartoons
covering just about the whole scene.  $2 from 1113 W. 31st Street, Austin,TX
78705, or $8/year.  More fun than the bats under the Congress St. Bridge.

Prometheus Books - Spring/Summer catalog - The skeptics resource, and no topic
is beyond examination.  This one highlights books which take a critical look
at whether "sports builds characters", police psychics, fundamentalist
disinformation over the separation between church and state, and lots of other
social/personal development issues.  Plus, they have the X-Rated Videotape
Guide IV, which is a great resource for porno lovers.  59 John Glenn Drive,
Buffalo NY 14228-2197 or call 24 hours at 800-421-0351.

Smite #2 - A great small zine that does what I'd like to see more of, stories
that dig beneath our most valued cultural icons to see what kind of slime and
sleaze might REALLY lurk just below the surface.  This issues articles on
Harvey comics (the theory of Casper the Ghost actually being the kidnapped and
murdered child of Charles Lindburgh makes a lot of sense), Barbi's master race,
society's unsung savior Norm Peterson, and getting fired from horrible jobs
are great.  Thanks for the kind words about HToMC too.  Send $1 or $10/year to
Smite, PO Box 624, Diboll, TX  75941.

Stay Free! - Lots of articles from the Chapel Hill scene.  Interviews with
Versus, the Grifter, plus tons of music reviews, and fun articles round out
this issue.  I expecially liked the Adbusters article on the front.  Write
to PO Box 702, Chapel Hill NC 27514 or cpalmati@email.unc.edu

Trash #14 - Of the various Chapel Hill street zines, this is probably one of
the best. Much better record/band reviews, plus much more imaginative articles.
The cover story reminds us that the Republicans who are giving Clinton a much-
deserved hard time are no good guys themselves, lest we forget all of their
scumbag antics in the 80s.  Plus, the GREAT cartoons T-Square and Mickey Death.
$7/6 issues from 405 E. Main St. Carrboro, NC  27510 (Videodrome)

Trigger Cut #6 - Being up out by Ohio high school students, this zine perhaps
isn't as flat-out intense of a zine as some people like (Karma Lapel was a bit
unfair in their pan, IMHO) but for people coming to grips with the state of
the world, I think they're doing ok.  Record reviews, articles, poetry,
commentary, stories, and silliness makes it a fun read.  No price listed, but
send a buck or two.  PO Box 891, North Olmsted, OH  44070

     Sub-orbital runs from the Third World are always the most fun.
 
     Every passenger has just stepped out of a Mach 20 tin can which,
two hours ago, was parked on a tarmac on the other side of the planet.
Each one of them paid enough for his ticket to buy a thousand bicycles
or a hundred horses for his countrymen whose only option is the
Mach .005 of footpower.  So it's not that difficult to raise their
entropy level a notch or two.
 
     They tend to divide pretty much into two groups:  government officials
and just-plain-rich, and if you can tell which is which, that's frequently
a useful bit of data.
 
     Three just-rich.  Husband, wife, teenage son taking it all in.
Obviously first time this far from home.  OK.
 
     "Hey, buddy, c'mere.  Check this out."  I pop a chip into the goggles
and offer them.  "Tell me you see this kind of V.R. every day at home.
 
     Keeps walking.  No interest.  Didn't really expect any.
 
     "You a gambling man?" I ask, continuing to walk alongside.  "My
five thousand dollars against your ten bucks.  Watch one minute, and
you won't want to take them off until the program is over."
 
     Sees my certified credchip for five kilobucks.  Breaks stride.
You don't get super-rich by passing up sweetheart deals, and five grand
for a couple minutes' effort is a respectable wage.  Especially if you
can take it off an obnoxious hustler.  Stops to listen.
 
     "Ordinary Virtual Reality goggles.  No hardwire to the pleasure center
or anywhere else in the grayware, so if your God or your government thinks
that's naughty, save it.  Nothing to do with what's happening here.  There
will be signals broadcast out at radio frequencies, and applied at skin
contacts, but only in the nano-to-microwatt level everybody's been using
forever.  And of course, the goggles do receive EEG patterns, and the
program modifies itself based on what your brain is doing.  Fair enough?"
 
     Looks at the goggles.  Satisfied.
 
     "The program on this chip runs about five minutes.  You agree to
keep your eyes open and to watch for at least the first minute.  After
that, you can win the bet on the spot, just by taking the goggles off.
My wager is that you will in fact keep them on until the very uttermost
photon has whacked your retina and the screens go dark--even though you
know that you will thereby lose.  That's it."
 
     Agreement.  Program begins.  After the initial minute I remind him
that his time is up, he can take off the goggles now and pocket the 5K.
No response.
 
     Remind at two minutes.  Brief snarl to shut the hell up.  Otherwise
as motionless as a zombie falling thru an event horizon.  Remind once more
at three minutes.  Looks dangerous.  Back away.   Wife and son were offering
"Take them off!" counsel, but have now shut up and have also backed away.
Good decision.
 
     The five minutes elapse.  He loses.  Am not surprised.
 
     Finally takes off goggles.  Disoriented.  Inquires, "Are not such things
as this illegal?"
 
     "Oooooh!  Illeeeeeegal!  Oh, help me Mr. Policeman:  This evil criminal
is hurting me and violating my rights because his hardware's running an
illeeeeegal pattern of ones and zeroes!  Make him stop!  Pleeeeeze!  Help me,
Mr. Lawmaker:  Draw us up a list of which of the 1024 by 1024 by sixteen
bloody million possible bit patterns are illeeeeeegal--like you had a
fuckin' clue about the technology you're trying to control at government
gunpoint--and pleeeeeze tell us which of the two to the power one gig ways
of filling our memory chips we can use without going to jail for doing something
illeeeeeegal . . .
 
     "It's a genuine pity that the phrase 'Congress shall make no law'
is so fuckin' ambiguous that those guys can't figure out what they're
allowed to do, but, I guess it is, and so there we are.
 
     "Oh . . . and ain't it a weird co-inkydinky that public-key cryptography
got hot almost exactly when my government started--and here you must forgive
a gross crudeness, but it is absolutely essential to describe the precise
nature of the deed--when my government started to blatantly, clearly, repeatedly
wipe its ass in public with the First and the Fourth Amendments to the
Constitution that is supposed to protect its citizens?
 
     "Almost makes you think of the walnut-brained dinosaurs getting a monster
meteor up the wazoo right when the faster-smarter mammals needed a break, 
n'est-ce pas?
 
     "Oh, thank you, Illuminati!  Thank you so bloody much!  Sure took
your fuckin' time about it, though, didn't you?  Or were you gonna wait
'til they repeal the goddamn Constitution outright and your baby pictures on a
bearskin rug get you shot dead as a child pornographer and there are guys
in Red Square carrying signs WILL BUILD NUKES FOR FOOD and poor Harry
Bergeron gets blown away by a bitch with a twelve-gauge and you gotta piss
in a bottle to mail a letter and you need a fuckin' Class 3 Federal
Firearms License to buy a box of .22s?  Federal Firearms License up your 
ass, man.  You ask my girlfriend real nice and she'll tell you where to buy
The Finest Energy Weapons in the Known Universe for 10% on the dollar, and
they'll even take those worthless obsolete pictures of Weishaupt which, for
obvious reasons, nobody else this side of Andromeda will take.

     "Hey B.A.T.F.: F.U.!  I don't keep guns in my house any more.  They're too
dangerous to have around.  'Cause I might trip over 'em when runnin'
to dial 1-900-BIGBANG on the fuckin' ansible, for hot nonlocal noncausal
phone sex with the nymphets who work the superluminal lines . . ."
 
     Definitely having an effect on them.  Speaking very loudly now,
and seem to be drawing a crowd.  Immediate audience is freaking somewhat.
Chill out.
 
     "Seriously, though, there are a few places on the planet where
people actually hallucinate that political control of information is still
remotely possible.  So I've got two separate ways to turn that chip into twenty
gigs of flatline-zeroes, on a microsecond's notice, if I had to.  Haven't had
to in a long time.  Most places where the average computer uses silicon instead
of beads-on-a-fuckin'-stick gave up the idea of prison for bit-patterns
about the same time they gave up their laws against consciousness-altering
vegetation.
 
     "But, hey, I've taken enough of your time.  Here's my card.  Modem
or voice me if you ever want to see again pixels like you just did.
In any case, welcome to my country, and have a great time while you're
here."  Shake his hand, kiss hers, and palm a chip into the son's.  Works
for one run only of What His Father Saw and then overwrites itself with
polemic to make him think, and crypto software to let him keep his thoughts
private.  Plus my modem and voice numbers.
 
     So, ten bucks in, one chip out.  I'm ahead enough to buy a drink.

     Her first time was with me, you know.  Sun-dappled days at camp,
naked among the wildflowers.  Like puppies frolicking in the grass.  That
made her very special in my eyes, and that's why I always felt kind
of protective toward her.
 
     I think sometimes she thought that I was kind of nerdy and a "brain,"
as they called them then.  Not "her type."  She wasn't really into intellectual
pursuits.  That's OK, Lo.  You don't have to be.  Not you.  You were fantastic,
Lo.  Never forget you, Lo.
 
     We remained great friends and stayed in touch after she went back to
Ramsdale.  We'd exchange letters and talk on the phone about all kinds of
things, but mostly I remember Lo was always having boyfriend problems.
 
     "Like, he is just soooooo possessive, you know?" she would go on.
"I mean, OK, he takes me on cross-country trips, right?  And, like, he
buys me lotsa nice presents.  But, Jeez, he's got all these rules,
you know?  He doesn't want me dating other guys. I can't smoke, I can't
do amateur theater, I can't do this, I can't do that.  I mean, honestly,
he treats me like a child!  I don't need this."
 
     I'd try to sympathize, of course, but it wasn't easy, because I still
carried a torch for her myself.
 
     "You know, Lo, sometimes in a relationship, one partner keeps growing
when the other has stopped.  Maybe you're going through changes that he can't."
 
     "Like growing breasts, you mean?" she'd giggle.
 
     She knew I still wanted her, the tantalizin' little tease.  But just
Geographically Unpossible.
 
     Well, she ultimately dumps this boyfriend in favor of another guy
who is rich and famous and who lets her do anything she wants.  He uses
his influence to try to get her into motion pictures, but she proves
to be a "difficult" actress due to unwillingness to take direction,
friction with others in the cast, etc.  And again she's unhappy about
the relationship:  This time she wants an exclusive commitment, but
he wants to be able to see other girls besides her.  She forces the issue,
and they break up.

     I lost touch with Lo for a while when I went into the Army.
Officers' Candidate School.  Manhattan Project.  Heavy-duty computer
simulations of all kinds of things.  They offered me incredible Access
to Toys.  At that time, the Project had carte blanche for men and materiel.
Lots of slack.  Open loop.  Implosions and Krytrons and Booms, oh my!

     Couple of ChiCom bureaucrats.   Very impressive that they've managed
to hold it together with over a billion beings under one authority into
the twenty-first century.  Hell, maybe I should buy these guys a drink
--try and pick their brains a little.

     Naah.

     "God bless you, my friends.  Jesus loves you.  'Bob' loves you.
Gimme a dollar."
 
     They just keep walking.  Veterans of airports, apparently.
 
     "Oh, do not turn away from me, my friends.  The Eye in the Triangle has
given a sly wink to that tantalizin', teasin' girl-Goddess Eris Discordia,
and the forces of chaos are on the march!  Gimme a dollar."
 
     Walking faster now.
 
     "My friends, there are rumors that, even while we speak, the Discordians
are designing circuit boards that will interface your telephone to the crypto
program in your PC and are planning to put the schematics out as free soft-
ware!  Were it not for the power of great Cthulhu and his minions, this hor-
rible blasphemy might even have occurred back during the Twentieth Century!
Do you understand what I am saying, my friends?  Do you?  Gimme a dollar."
 
     Much faster.
 
     "You can even have your choice of one of these stupid flowers, or a
chip with the phone numbers of ten thousand bulletin boards and fax
machines throughout China, and the on-chip digitized engineering
drawings for a submachine gun you can make out of scrap metal and
old woks!  Gimme a dollar."
 
    Running.
 
     One of them finally does stuff a dollar bill into my hand.
 
      "A million-dollar-bill!  Oh, thank you, my friends, thank you!
Your generosity will be rewarded, I promise you.  Since you gentlemen
seem to be in a hurry, I won't hold you up.  I'll just take a million of
the chips and airdrop 'em over Tien An Men Square.  You can pick one
up when you get home.  Praise 'Bob!' Cthulhu fhtagn!  Have a nice day."
 
     The bureaucrats continue to run, even faster than before.
 
     I turn and head for the bar.
 
     I join a good friend and two ladies there.  Since the ladies appear
quite young, at first the bartender refuses to serve them.
Various documents are produced, and I can overhear the phrase,
" . . . not only fire you but close down this whole fuckin' airport . . ."
Shortly all four of us are cheerfully imbibing.

     "Well, the point spread is 5 1/2, but I think they can cover it."

     Forgot.  Deaf and not too bright.  Jesus Christ Almighty, what a
Christmas Day this has been.  Losing it.

     Shouting:  "Listen to me:  The bitch bought it.  The brat bought it.

     Obviously, given the value of simstim royalties, the only way I could

     Way too close to the truth.  We almost lost her.  Honest to
Christ, we almost lost her.  My God.

     Remember: almost.  Only almost.  Lo is OK.  Girl-child is OK.
Gave birth on the chopper enroute to hospital.  Better than the
snake pit they found her in--but there were complications.

     Lo almost died.  Thank you, God, that she didn't.  Thank you, God,
for Lo.

     Lo is OK.  Now nursing daughter in the Army hospital.

     Couple deep breaths.  Pull it together.  Lo is OK.  I gotta let this
asshole live, I guess.  Lo is OK.

     Planned to fake deaths of mother and child anyway, but did originally
intend more tactful treatment toward "bereaved."

      Get it done.   Lo is OK.

     "Mr. Schiller, the bodies of both mother and child were unfortunately
burned beyond recognition in the fire."  (Which I started.)

     "The Army will pay for the damages and for a closed-casket funeral."
(Then you can go back home and diddle one of your six-toed cousins under
whatever goddamn rock you crawled out from.)

     "I am going to go wait for my chopper.  My little Chum here"--unholster,
point in air, not at him--"can print the whole clip into K5 at 50 feet, so I

talk about anything, look for a chubby merc packing better hardware than

     The bad parts are over for you, Lo.  You hung in this far from the
Primal Singularity, now lean on me for awhile.  Like from now on out to the
Cosmic Mind or the Big Crunch or Whatever Happens Next.  Just tried to make
you a smile out of a pain by rotating it through hyperspace along the axis
of surreality.

     (Jeez.  I keep thinking of the old joke about Yasser Arafat dying
on a Jewish Holiday.  Have people so misjudged you, my cute little
Lilith/Lo Deity-Darlin', that they might actually want to celebrate
your deathday?  Maybe you need a new P.R. man, somebody friendly
and easy-goin'?  Saw a guy carryin' a sign WILL WORK FOR GRASS AND
NYMPHETS.  Maybe we can get him.  You were fantastic, Lo.  Never forget
you, Lo.)

     Anyhoo, it's not one-two-three-strikes-you're-out in this
Universe, Lo.  Maybe in the Universe next door.  There's somebody in
this piece of the space-time continuum payin' attention to nymphets
in trouble, and ready to jump into my Calvin Kaluza Kleins and superstring
together a couple of infinitely long rotating cylinders of star-stuff
if that's what it takes to save your cute ass.

     So don't cry, Lolita darlin'.  Nobody's gonna collapse your state

     Say, Lo, now that Lolita the Second is in her nymphage, that fat
merc is back in town hittin' on her all the time, and she finally agreed to go
to Europe with him, and if they end up shackin' up, we oughtta probably
either cut them in on the simstim biz or at least buy them their own
airport to work in.

     And, listen, Lo, I made you an appointment with the gerontopediatrics
people to see about gettin' you your figure back.  No offense, but you ain't
5,300 days no more, Darlin', and you startin' to show a little wear and tear.

chokin' gargle that other cheap bastard wrote ya'.  Hey, Humbert,
in case you ever get another nymphet--which you probably won't, 'cause
you too stupid to even keep the first one--here's a tip:  You don't
buy 'em cookies, you buy 'em cars!)

     Yeah, I suppose I shoulda known that it was you all along--unrecognized
eponym and archetype--well, excuuuuuuse me, I got other things on my mind,
so why don't you just punish me by cooking up a worldwide sexual plague
so I gotta wear a goddamn inner tube and so then I can't just emigrate
to somewhere the age of consent's sane enough you don't gotta be a fuckin'
gerontophile to stay legal?

     But I digress.

                    *          *          *           *

     Merry Christmas, Lo.

     God bless You forever, my most precious of Christmas presents.

     We got a great future ahead of Us.

     (Oh, Lo, this is just between us:  Let 'em keep thinkin' that you
were really in danger back there.  Chatted briefly with Kip and Tip
on the astral plane, and it turns out that you only gotta spin the cylinder
faster than half the speed of light at the surface.  So you can see that
it woulda been possible for me to come get ya' in time even if I had
been too late.)

     You were fantastic, Lo.  Never forget you, Lo.

     May God bless and guide Us both, my Darling.

     It's gonna be an interesting ride.



********************************************************************
 CLIFF's NOTES TO ADD TO SURREALITY
 BUT READ THE STORY FIRST
 
     To begin with, a meme is a concept from Richard Dawkins' The Selfish
Gene.  It is roughly analogous to a gene, except that it exists in the
world of human culture.  Dawkins writes
 
          Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes
     fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches.  Just as
     genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body
     to body via sperm or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the
     meme pool by leaping from brain to brain. . .  If a scientist
     hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to his
     colleagues and students.  . . .  If the idea catches on, it can
     be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain.
 
     The story is intended as a weird cyberpunk riff on Nabokov's Lolita,
with distinct quantum-relativistic overtones.  In the course of the telling,
various respectable, honorable and noble memes find themselves inextricably
interwoven with disturbing, scandalous, and subversive ones.  Good.  That's
the plan!  The reason they call it "mind-fucking" is that it feels so good!

     First, much of the reminiscing in A New Lo is done by a character
who actually appears in Lolita, but gets maybe four sentences all together.
His name is Charlie Holmes (Galactic Coincidence Control gets credit for
the first name and last initial), he does take Lo's virginity, and
is (in the book) killed in the war.  The point at which one realizes
that Lo = Lolita makes her "boyfriend problems" with Humbert and Quilty
sort of mind-tickling, and even Joycean.  (Nabokov himself pays homage to
Joyce with phrases like "portrait of the artist as a younger brute" and
"internal combustion martyr"--and to surreality generally with Quilty's
observation, "Really, Mr. Humbert, you were not an ideal stepfather.")
One gets a single clue with the reminiscence about Lo going home from camp
to "Ramsdale," but it's a thin one.
 
     The doggerel poetry generally matches the rhyme pattern of that in the
original novel, part 2, Chapter 25, and even reproduces the key line "Where
are you hiding, Dolores Haze?" which is another clue to who Lo is.  Also a
thought about Virtual Reality's utility beyond letting architects show you
their fuckin' buildings.  More doggerel appears throughout, frequently
matching the rhyme scheme, meter, and at times duplicating (or almost)
entire lines.
 
     However, none of this comes up until after a reasonably solid cyber-
punk opening, and what I immodestly consider a great rant on "freedom to
compute and possess pixels."  The technical language is there to let those
who know relativistic physics realize whom they are dealing with.
 
     After the quatrain, then a set-up to twist your head later, a nod to
sub-Genii, and finally a straightforward clue and jab at lawyers, since
the first page of Lolita mentions the name of Humbert's attorney,
and the "advice" is precisely what Hý proceeds to do.
 
     We then pick up the plot of the novel, since, even though Lolita and her
deaf, stupid husband are awash in cash, they do (in the book) trek
to the godforsaken Alaskan wilderness outpost of Grey Star in her ninth
month for her to give birth.  Charlie Holmes--Lo's first lover, recall--
departs now from his negligible role in the actual novel to check this out.
 
    Weirdness begins to escalate, as the fat, crazy mercenary he works with
is also an ex-boyfriend of Lo's (which is possible, since she does spend
a couple years traveling around the USA) and so he takes a personal interest
in his job.
 
     Straightforward plot development, and the "check also first name
Lolita" made explicit for the not-too-swift.  And a key observation
that Lo's husband may be so stupid as to be dangerous.
 
     Ever-more-obscene poetry, introducing the phrase "giving wirehead"
into cyberspeak, and the key word (nano)nymphet for those who still may
be puzzled about who's who.  Some of the text from Charlie's message
is in fact verbatim from the ID cards issued to CIA operatives in Vietnam.
Charlie then turns out to be a second lieutenant.
 
     Cut to another airport harangue.   With definite cyber-applications.
 
     Cut back to Lo.  Doesn't look good for her.  Stupid mates can kill
ya', it seems ever more clear.  As in the novel itself, Lo and her girl-
child do endure a very unlucky childbirth on Christmas Day.
 
     More obscene poetry.  Suggests maybe something survived, though.
 
     Cut back to first airport haranguer.  Are we beginning to guess what
was on his chip?  How monetarily valuable the idea?  Still thinking about
fuckin' architects takin' you through buildings with V.R. goggles?
 
     Couple more quatrains, one using actual first two lines of one poem in
the actual book, one cutely mentioning a couple of currently sexy cyber-ladies.
 
     GOTCHA!
 
     Now, gets still weirder.  Jab at FDR.  Heavy-duty quantum-relativistic
names and buzzwords.
 
     Still weirder.  Tying up loose ends.  The bit about her age as
5,300 days comes from one of Humbert's poems in the book.
 
     Quatrain in French, like in original, but got a great rhyme
for French term for nymphet.  Quite proud of that.
 
     Still weirder.
 
     Really put out enough relativistic physics to blow 'em away.
Kip (Thorne) and Tip (Frank Tipler) are quantum physicists, and Tipler
wrote a paper about time-travel via (what else?) infinitely long rotating
cylinders of super-dense mass which was my throw-away line from a page
before.  One-half the speed of light is the surface speed at which such
cylinders must rotate to permit time-travel, and make for a very weird
quantum-relativistic sentence.  The bit about the astral plane was added for
extra spookiness, and also in case Kip or Tip should croak before I sell the
story.
 
     Covered a lot of territory, n'est-ce pas?

-----------------------------------------

          <miscellaneous artwork on this page>


My method of time travel is not particularly
effective, unless the vehicle is traveling 
at or near the speed of light, in which case
bailing out would hurt like a sonofabitch.
It is not recomended for anyone who can die
to use this method of time travel.

So there I was, driving my car down the freeway,
when it suddenly occurs to me that the ROAD is 
DRIVING down the bottom of MY CAR, and TIME is 
MOVING past ME, So all you have to do to travel through
time is to jump out of a moving car at high speed and
grab onto something  HEAVY.

Please share this information with all.

SPAM JAKE DAY -- A Summary
--------------------------

	By Reverend Brother Lee Harvey Oswald Smith, KSC WMD SPAM
	Episkopos, John Friedrich Cabal, Discordian Society

1) WHAT IS A JAKE? (AND WHERE CAN I GET SOME?)
----------------------------------------------

A Jake is defined as part of Operation Mindfuck. Basically, it involves
a lot of people collaborating to send a lot of weird stuff to some
bureaucrat/official/someone somewhere, asking for some information/help/
whatever, preferably in an obscure or unusual way. The letters are timed to 
arrive on the same day, and to make the bureaucrat/official/etc. think
that either he is the target of a global conspiracy of lunatics or the
general public are much more imaginative than he has previously thought.

2) WHAT IS THIS SPAM JAKE?
--------------------------

The plan: on Spam Jake Day (the twenty-third of May, 1994), a lot of
mail will arrive at the headquarters of Hormel Foods, the manufacturer
of Spam, from all over the world. This will be from various Discordian,
SubGenius and other weird religious groups; on official letterhead
(which looks rather weird), and from people with long, bizarre religious
titles. Each letter will claim that the sender's own group is the
original Church of Spam (with appropriate embellishments), and
requesting official endorsement from Hormel Foods as such.

3) HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?
-------------------------

If you wish to be involved in this global mindfuck, all you have to do
is write such a letter, in the name of your religion/conspiracy (if you
don't have one, found one), adding any embellishments you may wish to
add and send it to:

	Hormel Foods
	Corporate Offices
	1 Hormel Drive
	Austin, MN 55912

Send the letter before Spam Jake Day, if possible timing it so that it
arrives on Spam Jake Day. The rest is fnord up to you.

4) WHAT WILL THIS ACHIEVE?
--------------------------

With luck, somebody at Hormel will find their desk inundated with
curious missives from all sorts of strange groups from all over the
world asking for official sanction for some esoteric activity involving
Spam, or, in the parlance, "weird shit". Unable to dismiss this as a small, 
localised prank they will be very much puzzled by this and possibly
shall attain illumination from the shock. Candidates for official
approval may receive interesting replies; furthermore, the media may pick
up on this, distorting it and adding further chaos to the equation.
In any case, the ripples of this should be felt far and wide, if enough
people get involved.

5) WHY SHOULD I GET INVOLVED?
-----------------------------

Because if you don't, ye shall verily be transformed into a
Precious Mao Button and distributed to the Poor in the Region of Thud.
Or not.
