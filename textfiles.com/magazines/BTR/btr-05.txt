All about pot.

This Text is gonna be 1oo times better then the other BTR on growing pot..
Sorry that peice of shit slipped thru somehow. It shouldnt have though.
The guy who wrote it is gone now. :( So, heres to make up for it.

Growing, Cultuivating, Harvesting it etc. etc. etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you buy a bag, break up the bud's a little and pick out all the seeds.
(Seeds will now be refered to as Beeners)  These should NeVeR be thrown away
for they are the most important part.  For they are what will bring you more
pot! So save 'em all and smoke away... You'll thank yourself in the morning:)
If you cant get beeners dont goto some lame store like De Ja Vu and buy those
roasted hemp seeds and waste your money, they'll never grow, and even if they
did, they spray them so it would be shitty any ways. 

[ş úGrowing Marijuana Indoorsú ş]

What you will need is beeners (about 1 in every 3 grows) (to tell if they
will grow, throw them on a hot frying pan and if they crack, they will). 
You will also need a good source of light. Use a 75 Watt bulb in a desk lamp
(if you dont have a plant lite handy), dont use the kind that has a shade
use the kind that has an arm.  You'll also need some good soil (Potting soil,
hence the name) and miracle grow, and water).  Soak your beeners in a small
cup with toilet paper in the bottem, put in luke warm h2o.  Leave them alone
for 2 or 3 days, you'll see a little root possibly, but if not, dont fear
just plant them and they'll come up when their ready.  The great thing about
growing indoors is, less chance of getting busted and the plants are skimpyer
but more resin! So all the better.  Get a planter box about 4 ft long and 9 "
wide (depending on amount of beeners)  Put potting soil in it, and dig small
hole (about 1/2" deep) about 6" apart.  Put 3 or 4 beeners to each hole, for 
some wont grow. (Once, I was growing for about 6 months, with nice healthy
plants, and a new one came up, just a late starter :))  Pack the Dirt in all
over.  Now water, and give 1o - 12 hours lite, (With the sun schedule), then 
give them darkness.  You'll start to see them come out of the soil in about 
1 or 2 weeks.  Use a small amount of Miracle Grow mixed in with the water and
you'll see a big difference in growth.  Now about 4 months or whenever you 
feel ready (for they are YouR plants) Harvest, if you are in a hurry, but if
your not in a hurry then let them grow until they are starting to die (*you
might not be able to let them grow till they die, cause some get quite big*)
Now pick and dry and smoke.  

[ş úGrowing Marijuana Outdoorsú ş]

You dont have to do as much for this, for you are plating your Marijuana in
its natural habitat.  Soak beeners the same way as indoors, for a few days.
Find a sunny, not noticeable spot.  Dont do it on your land, unless you plan
on denying you ever knew about it. (Dont)  Dig the holes about 1" deep a few
feet apart.  4 - 6 beeners to a hole.  (its harder to get them growing).. Now
water, and let be.  Hopefully mother nature will be kúrad kool to you, and
you'll get some nice buds..  The plants will look much stronger, and thicker
then the indoor ones.  But a little weaker.  You cant change male or female
if growing outside. 




[ş úGetting more out of your WeeDú ş]                   

If your weed is realitivly weak, or you want it stronger, try this, get
an amout of weed in a ziplock baggie, and dampen the weed. Zip it up, and
put it in a dark closet for 2 or 3 weeks, it will get a little moldy but
its better, better potency.

When your done with your bowls worth, tap the bowl (and all the ash) into a 
baggie, and save it for a while.  Believe it or not, ash has THC still in
it, you just have to extract it.  Put the amount of ash into a pot of water
and bring to a boil. When it boils lower the heat to about Medium. Boil till
there is no more water, and just nasty shit.  Scrape up that nasty shit into
a bunch of bowl size cubes (make sure it is small enuf to be smokealbe in a
bowl)  Wait till it drys (Dont microwave), smoke.  That will kick all the THc
and res out of the ash.  Ash should never be thrown away.  Do the same with
stems, for they also contain ALOT of Thc.

Scrape your bowl, about every 2 months, save the black thick stickey stuff, 
that is all the weed you have smoked all condensed. it is strong, so keep 
saving this shit into a ball, untill you have some weed less nite..

If you smoke out of a bong then Never change the water, use the same.  Also
dont be stupid and think your cool by drinking the bong water, this will not
only make you look stupid, it will make you very sick.  It is all the crap
from the weed you've smoked. Even though its all crap, you can get baked off
it, so dont waste it.  This is the prcedure for extracting hash from bong 
water. Im not really sure if this is hash that you will be making, ive just
heard that it is. No garuntee.  Take the bond water, put it in a pot, and 
boil till the water is gone.  Then take put in fresh water, and boil again.
When it is all gone, compress all the crap left (No where NEAR as much as you
started)  and smoke.  Very good, potent stuff.  You could sell it, but dont
get into selling.  You'll get in a lot of Trouble if busted.



[ş úSome notesú ş]

You can Dry pot in a microwave, buts its always better in a book (for a small
amount) or just air dry.  In a microwave, Be sure not to over cook it, or it
will have been a total waste of time reading this, and spending some of your
life growing, put the weed on a paper towel, and put on TiMECooK for 20 sec's
and then if not dry enuf, change paper towel and do again.

There are two types of plants out there. Male & Female, you want more Female
and its possible to get more, thats in the next note.  Male plants can get you
stoned but they are no where as strong as female.  

To get more females try interrupting the sun schedule with 1 hour of light
in the middle of the night, every nite for a while, and it will shock the
plant into budding, which is good (incase you didnt know?)  That will 
produce more females.

Most weed contains from 1 to 4 % THC (tetrahydracanaboil (sp??)) which gets
you ripped in the first place.  4 Percent THC weed is considered good shit,
and 1 you shouldnt pay more then 50$ for an ounce of it.  

When your buying weed (in a large amount) make sure you sample it before,
it really sux getting ripped off, when you cant do anything about it.
And also make sure you know and trust the dealer.


[ş úForward, and afterwardsú ş]

Good luck on growing your pot and dont blame me if you get busted, this is
a text, and only a text..  If this has been a reel text, you would be 
notified by instructions flashing at the bottom of your screen.  Until next
time...  Have fun..

I would call this book:

'Tales From The Knightmare And Other Short Stories'

The author, 'The Knightmare' is the 'Super Hacker'. At first
you may be a little skeptical about this title he has, but
read on and you will say "WoW he seems to be a some form 
of a super hacker". I say this because this book is chock 
full of stories of how The Knightmare did this and The 
Knightmare did that. In most books that would be a negativo. 
But not in this case. He tells of dumpster diving, sneaking 
into cubicles, breaking and entering and many other fine arts.

On one story he gets his library card validated to a full 
librarian access so he has access to do whatever he wants
with books and peoples accounts. He does this by writting
a program that throws random bar code numbers into the pen
light in the library computer. NiCE job.

Look for this book at 'Barnes & Noble' (WoLF RoAD, LaTHaM,
New York) Or Borders across the street. Theres this guy that
works at B&N I social engineered him and got him to pay for some
of the book! I could tell you about the B&N computer but that  
would take too long. Maybe in another issue or something. Just 
ask for it by title all of the salespeople (well almost) have 
heard of it, if they haven't they sure as hell will know how to 
find it by the title. But sometimes certain salespeople don't 
feel right letting books like that into the open public even 
then they are in the open public. (To back me up by saying this 
just read the letters in 2600!)

Or just look down...

We got books for:

HaCKERS
CRaCKERS
aND
PiSTOL PaCKERS!

Includes a brief history of hacking, lists of likely password, a summary of
computer crime laws and a glossary.

In my opinion The Knightmare did a good job of the history of hacking by 
including the major milestons and things that have populated the hacker 
community as we now know it. If you want to buy a book on Computer Hacking
History then read Bruce Sterling's "The Hacker Crackdown". The Knightmare
did a good job of covering a lot in a little amount of space. But again the
point of the book was to be a new wave book on hacking. Chapter Two: The
History of Hacking is the only real section on the history it is 5 pages long.
That doesn't seem like much but I'd have to take a guess the book is about
12"tall by 7" wide. So it makes good reading.

At the begining of this book there is an introduction by a man named Gareth
Branwyn who seems to be pretty intouch with Cyberspace and the whole consept
of hacking. And Gareth goes through the many scenarios that would go on as:
Hacker as Independant Scientist
Hacker as Cowboy
Hacker as Techno-Terrorist
Hacker as Pirate
Hacker as Biblical David
Hacker as Security Informat
Hacker as U.S. Calvary
Hacker as Cyborg
and The Knightmare's Vision.

After the main book theres a section "Further Reading" that contains about 20
books on things that can make you a better hacker and have a better hacker
backround. Theres even a book of phone numbers on people to call who will
know numbers for just about everything!

Secrets of A Super Hacker goes by 3 sections with many chapters in each 
section.  PART ONE: Before Hack. PART TWO: During Hack. PART THREE: After 
Hack. Then after all of that fine reading there is a glossary that contains
words from 'acoustic coupler' - 'worm'. It is a very fine developed glossary
containing roughly 175+ definitions. Then the Appendices.

                        How to merc shit from Radio Shack
                                by:  Ramon!


Part One - Security:

Ha! What a joke! There is no security whatsoever at ANY Radio Shack I've ever 
seen. There are no magnetic alarms at the door,that thing that beeps as you 
enter the store is just to let employees (who are probably goofing off in 
back) know that there's someone coming in or out.  Go ahead, stuff your 
pockets when no one's looking and walk out.  They'll never know!

Cameras?  Not!  If a Radio Shack has a camera, there is only ever one and 
it can't cover the whole store.  Find the camera, which is usually in full 
view, and steal shit from where it's not pointing.  Even if you get filmed, 
most likely they'll never know what you stole is missing until they've 
already re-used the tape!  Another tip is to go at the end of the day just 
after they've been open for 8 1/2 hours.  By then the VHS tape will have run 
out and stopped recording.  Employees are either too busy or too lazy to 
change it anyway.  Most of the time they forget to start the tape at all!

Part Two - Tactics:

I suggest you go in with at least one or more partners.  However, if you go 
in alone, Go when it's packed with people looking at expensive shit like 
computers.  They'll keep the salesmen occupied while you rob them blind.  
Radio Shack employees are REQUIRED to greet you when you enter the store and 
offer you help.  To get rid of them, act slightly rude and tell them that 
you can find what you're looking for yourself.  That will get rid of them 
for good and they'll return to goofing off.

If you've got a couple of accomplices (I suggest three people total), go to 
one of the strip plaza stores (mall stores are riskier because they have more 
employees). Strip plaza stores usually only have two employees working at the 
same time, and if you're lucky there will only be one.  Find the deadest 
store possible.  Have the person with the light fingers go in first, be rude 
to the saleman and then go skulk in the corner with all the resistors and 
shit.  The salesmen work on commission and hate people who buy .99 cent shit.  
Have the second and third person arrive shortly afterward (remember: you 
don't know each other!!!).  Have these people distract the salesmen by 
inquiring about expensive products (not the ones you want to steal obviously)
Ask dumb questions like technical specifications and when the salesman can't 
answer them, demand to see the manual for it!  This will cause the person to 
go digging around the disorganized stock room for a while trying to find the 
box for it. One down.  Another tactic is to ask for a demonstration.  Two 
down!  While these idiots are distracted, the first person is free to fill up 
his coat or whatever with valuable merchandise!  I've seen people get out of 
there with VCRs, CD Players, cordless phones, even a fax machine!  Radar 
detectors and scanners are the easiest, though, so you might want to start 
with them.  The sale displays by the door just beg you to rob them!  Some 
even have full boxes that you can return without a receipt and exchange for 
what you really want.  They do require a receipt for cash back, tho'.

The only danger that you should possibly worry about is someone in back 
watching the camera monitor.  Easily found out if you call the store from a 
payphone during the robbery and see if someone other than the people up front 
answers.  (also a great distraction!)

Part Three - Disclaimer:

***ATTENTION!***  If you are stupid enough to get caught doing this, then 
you deserve to go to jail!  It's so fucking easy, though, a moron could do 
it.  Nonetheless, I take absolutely no responsibility for anything that might 
happen to you, so go ahead and tell 'em I told you to do it.  They'll probably 
laugh in your face.

I was just watching 'Australian Rules Football' then I changed the
channel. And what do I see on USA? A commercial for this handy
toy called 'Memo Mate'. On Memo Mate you recorded a reminder then
played it back at a later time. Example: Pick Up Judy At 4:oo PM.
It seems to record longer messages than a Voice Greeting Card. 
Plus the Memo Mate is smaller than a business card. Very portable.
It has a black case with a button big enough to fit on your thumb.
The rest is all the speaker. And I believe it takes batteries.
So this toy Memo Mate could be used to make a Red Box, record misc.
tones. Or just totally PHREaK OuT! I myself have not taken the
time to order this. Nor plan to. So if you find out that this is
a nice handy phreaking tool. Drop me a line or something on

Is Scanning Legal?
------------------

Defination of Scanning :

Scanning [skannin] : Calling #'s in sequencial order looking for intresting
                     things, carriers, loops, pbx's etc. etc. etc.


A while ago I was scanning 8oo nums like mad [using PsychoScan of course :)]
I was doing it 24/7 every day for 5 days to a week.I was getting mad karryerz
I had about 70 or 80 a day!  I thought this was all well and good until a week
later when i got a letter from AT&T's 8oo watz services saying: (something 
like)

You have been abusing the AT&T wats service and exceeded your maxium number
of calls 2ooo a month. If you are running a business then please tell us, or
else the next offense will result in a $1o,ooo fine and/or imprisionment.


I called an operator and asked to be transfered to AT&T, then talked to an
operator for a while, and asked why couldnt i dial 8oo nums? she was nice in
the begining then she said she'd call me back with the info, when she did she
was a bitch about it.  She said that i was breaking the law and might get a
fine, so i kindly told her to fuck off. and hung up..  They turned off my 8oo 
services for about 2 weeks, then it came back on.  This is all well and good
but now we get to the question :  Is scanning legal.  Well we dont relly have
an answer for you.  Once i called an operator and said 'I was wondering if
it would be legal if I (with my computer) called every 800 number sequencially
and she said 'Yes i dont see why not, as long as you dont prank call anyone'
and as long as i dont call the same number over and over its okay.  Well she
says it is and they say it isnt.  I have a good mind to write them a fucking
letter telling them to get their story straight.  So my question was never 
answered. Is skanning legal?


I think we should find out, and make it legal if it isnt.  Afterall they dont
know we scan to find things to hack.  We could just say were looking for not
known bbs's in the 800 exchange?

If anyone gets any info on this topic, please send it in imediatly to AWoL

Later

ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

DESCRIPTION:
The Nine Inch Nails box is a box file that allows you to broadcast music and
voice over the PA system at your local school.  It is illegal, i should guess,
but it is lots of fun, and it would be hard to get caught after it is installed
(unless you are an idiot and you blab it all over.  Remember, i am NOT
responsible for what you do, so Nyahhhhh!

BUILDING IT:
In order to build it, you will need:
<=A microphone ( for those of you who find a secluded spot, or those idiots)
    --or--
<=A Lunch Box (i will attach a piggyback to the arj containing the destructions)
    --or--
<=A standard stereo or Walkman

<=Wirecutters
<=Screwdriver
<=A Good Diversion (tm)
 
Step I
First off, find the box containing the PA speaker.  Then, using your Good 
Diversion (tm), unscrew the box and quickly cut into the two wires connecting 
the speaker to the school.  Be sure to leave these connected to the speaker, or
your box will be over shortly, as the speaker won't work and the school will
repair it, finding your box.  Just strip the wires, and attach a piggyback
wire to each.  Cover these quickly with electrical tape or shrink wrap, or the 
sound signal might get fuzzy.  At this point, you may want to replace the PA,
should your Good Diversion (tm) run out of late.

MICROPHONE:
Step II
De-attach the plug with the wire cutters.  Strip the wire back.  There may be
two wires parellel to each other, in which case attach one to each side of the
speaker.  In another case, there may be another insulateds wire inside the 
first.  In this case, attach the outer wire to one wire of the speaker and the
other to the remaining wire.  Should the mic have two different color, mettalic 
wires (ie one blue, no insulation, one red, no insulation), it is too hard to
do, and you should get another microphone.  Tape up the entire ensemble and
to what you will with it.  
To Use
Just talk into the mic.  It should work over the whole system, lest you have an
newer system.  Still, it may work.  By the way, if the microphone is not a 
battery operated one, you will need to wait until the PA is used to talk to the 
students.
WALKMAN:
Step II
Get an old pair of headphones (REAL old; the new ones have that stupid blue and
red metal wires).  Cut off the phones.  Attach the two inner wires to the two
outer wires, or red to red and blue to blue (strip the insulation first, 
please), etc.  Attach one side to each speaker wire.
To Use
Attach the unit to the headphone jack.  In order to work it, just press play.
LUNCH BOX:
Step II
Get the receiver.  Take off the part attached to the earphone.  Attach one side
to each speaker wire.
To Use
Make sure the unit is on.  Transmitting should play through the unit.  In order 
to play music, make the headphone attenuator described under WALKMAN, only 
attach it to the wires where the microphone goes.

APPENDIX B:  Simple troubleshooting.

Problem                 Reason                Solution

Unit does not work.     No power.             Add in an amplifier, between the 
                                              speaker wires and the sound unit

                        Wires not connected.  Connect the wires and try again.

                        You fucked it up      Take up a new hobby, maybe 
                        real bad.             woodcarving or toy collecting.
                        
Sound is fuzzy.         Tape isn't on good    Readjust the tape.
                        enough.

                        Connetion is bad.     Solder the wires.

Sound is too loud.      Too much power.       Tone it down with resistors.
        
                        Too loud volume.      Turn down the volume.

Sound is too soft.      Not enough power.     Add in some capaciters.

                        Too soft volume.      Turn it up, dumbass.

The music sucks.        Stupid tape.          Play something cool.

You get caught.         You are an idiot.     Get a knife and slit your 
                                              wrists, chode.

Have fun, and always remeber, TUESDAY'S THE DAY!.

Getting Money out of Radio Shack :

Doesnt BTR Just Kill Radio Shack!?

O-ke-do-ke..  First obtain 2 Radio Shack stores in the same near vacantety of
each other.  Go in with a few friends.  Distract the Employees, and have 1
friend rip off a bunch of phone supplies. (biege boxes, wall plates etc. etc)
Next, get out of the store (make sure you get about 15-20 $ worth of phone 
stuff.  Go to your car (or bike :() and add up the total of all your merchan-
dise.  Then goto the other Radio Shack and return it. As long as it's under
3o.oo (i believe) you can get the cash back!  I did this a few times and never
had a problem, its the easiest muny ive ever made.  And the funniest.  Just
tell the guy at the counter your mom bought this 4 you and its not what you
wanted, so you need yer money back!  Easy as that...  Try it..
