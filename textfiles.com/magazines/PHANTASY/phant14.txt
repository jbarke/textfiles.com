 Section [2]: Rune Stone BBS Information
              By: Mercenary

 
 Well Folks, I've got good news and I've got bad news.....

 First the bad news, The Rune Stones public line will not be installed most 
 likely until May of 1993. This is due to the fact that I'm moving again.
 For those IIRG Members with access to the private line, please note that
 that the number will be changing. Please pick up the newest member package.
 My move is prompted by the current economy, hence where the money is, so am I.
 So whem Im settled in at my new location, so will the Rune Stone.
 
 Now the good news...

 The Rune Stone BBS number will be made generally available to all readers of
 Phantasy and when you log-on and become a Validated user,you will have
 access to over 3000 H/P/A Text Files.
 
 Please note that due to my changing locations, the next several Issues of
 Phantasy may be slow in appearing as I'll be busy and wont have much time
 to devote to the magazine till after the move.

                               Thanks for the Help and Support

                                       Mercenary/IIRG

 Section [3]: "Operation Gray Chip Completed"
               By: Knight Hack


                       OPERATION GRAY CHIP COMPLETED

  The FBI,US Customs Service,and Internal Revenue Service along with
 detectives from Santa Clara,San Jose,and Fremont California have just
 completed a four month sting operation code-named "Operation Gray Chip".
  Undercover agents and detectives reportedly bought and sold allegedly
 stolen semiconductors and computer parts on the "Gray" Market.
  The sting operation targeted brokers and dealers in California,Taiwan,
 Argentina, and Singapore. Most of these dealers have reportedly been 
 selling parts to legitimate computer companies in the United States and
 Far East for years. Some 30 "Gray" Market brokers have been arrested
 as a result of the sting operation.
  The sting operation is said to have been designed to send a message to
 those who purchase semiconductors,disk drives, and other parts from less
 than legitimate sources According to Sgt. Paul Kirby of the Santa Clara
 Police Department.
  Those individuals arrested have been charged with criminal conspiracy,
 and multiple counts of attempted receipt of stolen property. Names of 
 those arrested and the companies involved are expected to be released 
 soon.
  Parts for the sting were provided by Intel,Quantam Corp,and Conner 
 Peripherals,along with other well known companies. The sting involved 
 sales by undercover agents to brokers who thought they were getting a 
 deal because the merchandise was HOT.
  More than 2 Million in Cash and 1.55 Million in parts were confiscated
 over the 4 month duration of the operation.

The following text is transcribed from a message which was left on Predat0rs 
answering machine at 502-499-8933.

Hello, this is John or Predat0r the former SysOp for Blitzkrieg BBS. I'd like 
to say as of the 12th of January, 5.00pm, 502-499-8933 will no longer be an
active line which means the system's gone.

When I get a new line and a new number I'll put it on Pentavia, Ripco, other 
real popular boards like that. I'd like to say thanks for everybody who
supported the system while it was up.

From February of 1990 to January 1993 it had 27,834 callers. The last official 
user to call was Sinister Solution.

I'd like to say when the new system goes back up it'll be bigger, better and 
even more underground than it was now.

I officially retire as Predat0r and I officially retire Blitzkrieg. So when the
 new system goes up, I'll have a new handle and a new name for the board.

If you need to get in touch with me, use the post office box, there still good 
and if you want my new voice number you'll figure out how to get it.

Stay free and I'll see you all again real soon...

                 FOR RELEASE TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1992        AT&T SMART CARD VOICE PRINTS INCREASE SECURITY OF NCR ATMs     SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- NCR Corporation and AT&T Smart Cardshave demonstrated a prototype of a new generation of automatedteller machines (ATMs) they are developing that will use AT&T'scontactless smart card technology to offer customers additionalservices, like a security system that works by verifying thecardholder's voice print.     The prototype and several potential applications of the newterminals are being shown at the Retail Delivery Systems Con-ference here this week.     The two AT&T units also announced that AT&T's smart cardreaders can be connected to NCR's point of sale terminals, andthat they will begin working with banks to develop new smartcard-based applications that will run on ATM and point of salemachines.     NCR, a unit of AT&T, is the world's largest supplier ofATMs.  AT&T Smart Cards is a leading supplier of contactlesssmart cards and applications.     AT&T contactless smart cards look like other bank cards--they're the same size and just as thin--but they havemicroprocessors and memory chips laminated within their plasticshells.     Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the United States,their electronic memory can hold the equivalent of several pagesof typewritten information, personalized to the card's user.     That data is accessed by a reader/writer device, which, inaddition to being installed in an ATM, can be connected to a cel-lular or wired telephone, personal computer, automobile (forelectronic toll collection), or other device.  Because the readerhas no moving parts, it is more reliable than contact-cardreaders.     "Our smart card can be viewed as a secure, portable, per-sonal database that will provide banking customers with enhancedsecurity and a broad spectrum of new services," said DianeWetherington, president of AT&T Smart Cards.     {familiar ATM into a new kind of financial transactionstation," said Jim Adamson, vice president of NCR Self-Serviceand Financial Systems Division in Dundee, Scotland.     "One obvious benef{ion beyond PINs (per-sonal identification numbers), which a thief might be able tofind out.  For example, one of the demonstrations at the RetailDelivery Systems Conference will be a voice-based security systemthat works by comparing the cardholder's voice print with onestored on the card.  Unless the two match, access to the accountis denied.     "But that's just the beginning," Adamson adds.  "Since muchof a customer's account information is stored on the card, he orshe doesn't necessarily need to go to an ATM if all they need todo is check that information.  You can use a personal computerwith a smart-card interface, for example, or a similarly equippedpublic telephone.     "Of course, security features on the card will prevent usersfrom changing the information on the card when they are notlinked to their bank's computer network."     When customers do go to an ATM, they are given customizedmenu options based on their account profile stored on their smartcards.  This might even include offering them a connection to afinancial institution not normally on the ATM network, such asa brokerage house where they have a money market account.     In addition to convenience and security, another benefit ofusing AT&T contactless smart cards with NCR's terminals, is thata single card can be used for multiple applications--a solutionto consumer complaints about the proliferation of cards they needto carry around.     Using AT&T's communications network and NCR's installed baseas a backbone, AT&T can develop and deploy applications for avariety of customers.  For example, a single card could serve asan ATM card, an insurance information card, and a debit card formaking purchases in a store, placing phone calls, paying highway,bridge and tunnel tolls, paying mass transit fares, and evenbuying from vending machines.     Funds for each of these uses can be transferred at any ATMfrom the customer's bank account to the debit portion of thecard.  With a smart card reader/writer connected to an NCR pointof sale terminal, the consumer has access to a full range of pay-ment options.     AT&T smart cards also make it possible for ATMs to expandbeyond mere banking functions.  For example, "electronic tickets"for airline travel, sporting events, plays, or concerts could bepurchased at an ATM and loaded onto the smart card.  The cardwould then be accessed at the airport, stadium, theater or con-cert hall.     "The AT&T contactless smart card reader is a perfect exampleof the potential for joint technology development between NCR andAT&T," said Adamson.     AT&T plans to make the smart card interface available toother terminal developers, as well.     NCR, an AT&T company, develops, manufactures, markets,supports and services enterprise-wide information systems forworldwide markets.     AT&T Smart Cards, based in Bridgewater, New Jersey, is anAT&T strategic business unit that develops and markets smart cardproducts and applications.     The business does all of its development and manufacturingin the United States (its factory is located in Little Rock, Ar-kansas).  AT&T also has a cooperative agreement with NippondensoCo. to market smart card applications in Japan.                            #   #   #NCR is a registered trademark of NCR CorporationADDITIONAL BACKGROUND ABOUT AT&T'S SMART CARDS     AT&T's smart card consists of an 8-bit microcomputer, andfeatures its own operating system, 3 kilobytes of electricallyerasable read-only memory (EEPROM), an asynchronous serial datalink, and a security system to prevent files from unauthorizeduse.     AT&T's smart card differs from other smart cards in severalimportant ways:   o It uses a contactless interface to provide power to the card     and to perform data transfer.  Other smart cards have ex-     posed metallic contacts, which produce reliability problems     with wear, contamination, and damage due to electrostatic     discharge.  AT&T pioneered a design that allows the smart     card to transmit data to a card reader without metal-to-     metal contact.  The card transfers data by changing the     charge on capacitive plates in the card and the reader.   o The microprocessor uses a flexible, UNIX(TM)-like operating     system designed specifically for AT&T's smart card.  Host     computers or terminals can interact with the card using     predefined, high-level software commands.   o Security is also enhanced by the inclusion of a security al-     gorithm.  Encryption, decryption and message authentication     can be performed to facilitate secure transmissions over in-     secure links to and from the host system or terminal.   o The card's file management architecture allows a number of     applications to reside on one card.  For example, in     banking, one card can be used to hold information on a     customer's checking, savings, loan, and line-of-credit ac-     counts, while also storing biometrics, such as the     customer's signature, voice and fingerprints for security.     In addition, that same card can be used for travel or other     applications.   o The card has built-in security features.  Information stored     on the card can be isolated in such a way that access to     data in a particular file on the card can be limited to     users authorized to access that portion of the card.  This     allows different applications to reside on the same card     without giving all handlers access to the entire database.     AT&T smart cards are already being used in several ways:ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION     Without stopping, drivers approaching a toll plaza insert asmart card into a transmitter mounted on their dashboards.  In-formation stored on the card is transmitted to the toll stationvia radio link, and the cost of each toll is either debited froma pre-paid amount on the card or recorded for billing later.PENSION RECORD-KEEPING     Italy's post office is now using a pension-administrationsystem supplied by Olivetti that uses AT&T's smart card as arecord-keeping device for pensioners.COMPUTER SECURITY     Other customers are using the AT&T smart card to limit ac-cess to computer systems containing proprietary information.Authorized users dial into the systems from their portable com-puters, and the systems have been programmed to interface witha smart card.  Without the card, the systems cannot be accessed.BUILDING SECURITY     AT&T has several applications in the U.S. and Japan in whichthe smart card is used for employee identification and buildingaccess control.     But these are just the beginning.  The government could usesmart cards to replace printed food stamps, driver's licenses andvoter registrations.  And a medical smart card could provide aphysician with a patient's complete and up- to-date medicalrecord.  The same smart card can also store insurance informationin a separate file.  Having this information on a card would alsoexpedite admittance to a hospital.     "The 1990s is a decade of customization," says Wetherington."Businesses will need to redesign the way information is gatheredand processed, in part because customers' definitions of ac-ceptable service times and intervals are changing.     In some cases, this will require reengineering where and howproducts and services are delivered.  "Smart cards willrevolutionize personal and business information access andprocessing by providing instant point-of-need transactions," shesaid.

                      DEA SECURITY - NOT THAT SECURE!

  The Government Accounting Office (GAO) has just released a new report
 titled "Computer Security: DEA is Not Adequatly Protecting Sensitive
 Drug Enforcement Data".
  It seems DEA Agents reguraly made standard Security Violations in the 
 areas of,

    1. Sharing Computer Passwords
    2. Left Passwords Taped to Terminals
    3. Used easily identifiable Passwords (Such as "DEA")
    4. Threw out Classified Materials in the Trash

  So for all you Console Cowboys hacking the DEA, times a Wastin
  these boys know nothing of proper security procedures!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The IIRG recieved the following message at Mercenary's mailbox from an
 unidentified user at llwnet.linknet.COM (Cheshire HS) and we found it most
 interesting, We'll explain why afterwards...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 LOSER ALERT! LOSER ALERT!
 FROM AN ANONYMOUS PIRATE SYSOP
 ------------------------------
 HANDLE:    Homicidal
 REAL INFO: Jason L.(IIRG Deleted)
            (IIRG Deleted)
            Wallingford, CT 06492
            (203)(IIRG Deleted)
 AGE:       16
 ------------------------------
 This kid is every pirate's nightmare. In his infinite
 stupidity, he lost his access on the one major Connecticut
 pirate board he had access on. Then he wanted revenge. He
 called up the SPA (Software Publishers' Association) piracy
 reporting hotline and the Apogee piracy hotline. He turned in
 several big-time pirate boards. He gave BBS names, BBS
 numbers, Sysops' handles, Sysops' real names, Sysops' voice
 numbers, Sysops' addresses, Sysops' ages, his accounts on
 small-time pirate boards, EVERYTHING! This kid fucked
 EVERYBODY over! Several decent pirate Sysops deleted their
 entire hard drives for fear that the FEDS would come knocking
 at their doors. He shattered the fragile trust that exists
 between the members of Connecticut's pirate community. In a
 taped phone conversation (which was eventually made into a
 Sound blaster VOC and then distributed) he admitted to
 turning in pirate boards and also uploading viruses to
 several BBS's. He also said that his "master plan" consisted
 of bringing down all pirate boards and trashing the local
 modem scene with "outside help from ex-modemers" who
 supposedly hold grudges against current-day users. He turned
 in kids who were hacking Internet also. If this kid ever
 calls your BBS, just fucking delete his punk ass!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We didn't know if the information was true as Mercenary is based in CT. and
 He'd heard nothing of any Major BBS Busts or actions in the area.
  But all of a Sudden this appeared in the Paper as well as in CUD 5.03.

  From the 1-7-93 Issue of The Cheshire Herald (Front Page)
    Typed by Lord Valgamon (YUNSANJ@YALEVM.YCC.YALE.EDU)

          THREE CHS STUDENTS CHARGED IN BURGLARIES
           Former CHS Student Also Charged in Case
               by Amy Carpenter, Herald Staff

     Three Cheshire High School students and a former student charged
with the theft of $23,000 worth of computer and electronic equipment
from the high school have turned themselves in to Cheshire police.

     Jared D Bishop, 17, of 500 South Meriden Road, William J Vallo,
17, of 1081 South Meriden Road, and John Beltrami, 17, of 12 Woodland
Drive, have each been charged with 6 counts of third-degree burglary,
6 counts of third-degree conspiracy to
commit burglary and first-degree larceny by common scheme,
police said.

     Brendan Monahan, 17, of Littleton, New Hampshire, was
charged with third-degree burglary, third-degree conspiracy
to commit burglary and third-degree larceny, police said.

-Lesser Charges

     Monahan, a former CHS student, received the lesser charges
because he is believed to have participated in only 1 of 6 burglaries
at the high school, said Detective Thomas Stretton.

     Bishop and Vallo turned themselves in last week, and Beltrami and
Monahan turned themselves in early this week, Stretton said.

     All four were released to the custody of their parents
and are scheduled to appear in Meriden Superior Court on
January 14, police said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 It seems funny to us that these two incidents would originate from the same
 place, so there may be some validity to the Rumor we recieved.

                      IBM WORKING ON SUPER DRIVE? 

  IBM Corporation is rumored to be working on a read/write head for hard-disk 
 drives that will propel disk bit densities up into the range of 8 billion bits
 per square inch. Current leading edge Winchesters area densities are in the
 neighborhood of 250 million bits per square inch.
  Even this may fall short of the rumored that students at the University of
 San Diego are working on a head capable of 10 Billion bits per square inch.

                        THE GRIM REAPER IS A NARC
                Oh No!, Mr. Narc has kicked me out of TDT!

=============================================================================
        
  Today at about 6:00 Central time I was talking with my girlfriend. 
 I clicked on my call waiting button and it was The Grim Reaper 
 (Mike A.(IIRG DELETE). He told me to call him back because his didn't want 
 to pay for the phone call. I told him I would call him back in 5 minutes and
 he said fine. I was called back 10 minutes later by Grim and he told me I was
 kicked out.I asked why and he said it was because I hadn't called him
 back. He said I didn't respect him and wasn't loyal to him. He went on and
 on about how I've never done anything for TDT, but now that
 he has kicked me out,I guess I might as well tell everyone the real story
 about The Grim Reaper.
        The truth is Grim is a narc.  He is the one who got Mind Bomb nailed.
 He went off on Sought After and has been trying to get him busted for
 a while.  His next targets are Renegade Chemist and Butcher.  He always
 told me that all other cracking groups would eventually die out.  And the
 way this would happen would be through his great ability to narc.  Why do 
 you all think I followed him from FLT to OFG to TDT?  Remember Infinite Range 
 Rock?  He wasn't loyal to Grim, he was nailed.  I've stuck with that fucking 
 Narc for 3 groups.  He has told me a lot of shit, and now I'm going to tell 
 it all to you.  
        I have nothing against TDT, I have nothing against Sought After, or
 anyone in the pirate scene.  I do have something against Grim.  He was the  
 person who took the fun out of all the groups I was in.  He wanted people
 to fear him.  And when I wouldn't kiss his ass he kicked me out.
        Grim didn't even go to court when he got busted with TNSHB.  I don't
 know all the details about the deals he cut, but I know he is a narc.
 He is putting out shit about me not doing anything for the group which is
 complete bullshit.  People like the Grim Reaper should not be in the pirate  
 scene.  He kills accounts, he busts people, and ruins BBSing to further
 himself. 
        Luckily, I have a life!  People like the Grim Reaper who quit
 college, have no job, and no friends to BBS are sorry.  I'm going to lay
 low for a while, and just hang out on a few boards.  I'm done with groups.
 TDT is and will be my last one.  I have a girlfriend, I have school, and  
 now I don't have to deal with Grim's bullshit.  My warning to guys in TDT
 and the pirate scene.  Grim is a NARC, you don't screw with people like
 that.  I've learned my lesson.  All I can say is get out of TDT.  Get out
 from under the thumb of Grim.  He will fuck you over.  
 
 Grim Repear [TDT/NARC] ÄÄ Go ahead bust me.  I can care less. Hell, you can
   even post my address and come to my house.  The last time we talked I had
   it .VOC'ed.  I kept tabs on you Mike.  I'm not going to release it unless
   you try something.  Like I said before, I'm not here to take TDT down or
   do any bullshit like that.  I'm here to tell the truth.  Don't fuck with
   me Mike.  The only way to learn from a narc, liar, and thief like you is
   the hard way.  I've learned, and now it's over.  Go to hell, die, and
   get a life fat ass.

 Sought After [TDT] ÄÄ  I have nothing against you.  You are cool Zach.
   Everything I thought about you was wrong.  I was brainwashed by the big
   Narc.  Get out while you can.  You know he busted Mind Bomb, you were
   on the fucking phone, don't deny it.

 

 To All ÄÄ  I never tried to break apart TDT after I found out I was kicked 
            out.  I'm not interested in going after Grim or narcing on him,
            unless he pulls his bullshit on me.
