 Section [1]: New Onslaught of Hacker Mania
              Editorial By: Silent Botherhood

              Staying Alive and Surviving in the Nineties.

   Seems to be a common theme amongst everyone nowdays, from the layed-off
  factory worker to the grandmother on Social-Security.
   And yet Big Brother seems fit to be on another current wave of round-ups
  of those "EVIL HACKERS" once again.
   Those of here at the Brotherhood have a few questions to ponder, and we'd
  ask you to join us on our contemplation.

   1. How come during a declining Economy, Federal Agencies such as
      the Secret Service and F.B.I., always seem to Dig-up
      "Domestic Threats"?

  Response:

  Job Security, Who do you know that wants to be layed off?
  Agents must look busy, especially during an election year, and what better
  way to pad the payroll then by chasing a 15 year old computer enthusiast.
  Plus, this is  much less demanding than say, rounding up real terrorists
  who just might actually have the gall to shoot back.

  2. Why do Government Agencies such as the Secret Service and F.B.I.
     Confiscate equipment, Never press charges, then never return those
     items?

  Response: 

  MONEY!! What better way to line the old pockets with a few extra bucks,
  Ever seen those ads for Government Auctions? I bet you have boys and girls!
  And it saves those agents the trouble of shoplifting, such as Secret Service
  Agent Joyce Fletcher,(A Dan Quayle Body-Guard), they're not very good at it.

  3. Why Target Hackers,Phreakers, and Pirates?

  Response:

  Like we said earlier, a computer enthusiast makes a nice easy mark.
  Whens the last time you saw this headline,

 "SECRET SERVICE BUST GOES BAD, 15 YEAR OLD HACKER KILLS 5 WITH DISK DRIVE"
  
  Nice to know you won't be shot at, plus the real people ripping off
  more phone service than you can shake a stick at,"THE MOB", has guns
  and a few trigger happy boys to use them.
  As for Pirates, a little under the table "Bonus" for cracking down on
  someone dealing in your product has become a way of life.

  Well, it all boils down to Survival.... And unless the economy shores
  up or we get in a nice little war again, We won't see a let-up of
  pressure on the Federal Agencies to legitamize their payrolls.

                         THE SILENT BROTHERHOOD

  P.S.: If your an F.B.I. or S.S. Agent reading the above article
        I own nothing, I live off of Food Stamps, I live under a bridge,
        and I sure as hell hope you don't hold a grudge....

 Section [2]: New Information on USA Bust
              From: CUD #4.06

   The following appeared in Computer Underground Digest Issue 4.06, it seems
  to conflict with what else we've learned about the Bust here at Phantasy.
   We present it here in its original form as to offer both sides of the
  story, as CUD's story appears to conflict with the news file currently 
  circulating on the Pirate Community Boards. (SEE SECTION [4])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Date: 8 Feb 92 17:31: 39 CST
  From: Moderators (tk0jut2@mvs.niu.edu)
  Subject: File 1--Bust of "NotSoHumble Babe" / USA

 The recent busts of three persons in the Detroit and Los Angeles areas
 for alleged carding, theft, software copyright violations and fraud
 raise a number of issues of CU relevance. Because of misinformation
 circulating on the nature of the case, we summarize what we know of it
 below.  "Amy" (handle: "NotSoHumble Babe") was busted on her birthday,
 and is not untypical of many CU types, so we focus on her.

 1. "Amy" was busted on Jan 30, in Farmington Hills (Mi), by local,
     state, and federal agents. There were reportedly up to 20 agents.
     The large number was because there were several from each
     department, including the FBI, SecServ, Mi State police, and
     others. They reportedly showed no warrant, but knocked on the door
     and asked if they could come in. When "Amy" said "yes," they burst
     (rather than calmly entered) with weapons, including
     "semi-automatics." Her boyfriend was reportedly asleep, and the
     agents awakened him with a gun to his head.  The agent in charge
     was Tony Alvarez of the Detroit SecServ.

 2. There has been no indictment, but the agents indicated that charges
    would include theft, fraud, and copyright violations.  (software
    piracy and carding). The initial figure given was a combined $20,000
    for the three ("Amy," "Tom," and Mike").

 3. All equipment was confiscated, included "every scrap of paper in
    the house. She was informed that, whatever the outcome of the case,
    she would not receive the equipment back and that it would be kept
    for "internal use."

 The above account differs dramatically from one given by "anonymous"
 in "Phantasy #6," which was a diatribe against the three for
 "ratting." However, the above account seems fairly reliable, judging
 from a news account and a source close to the incident.

 "Amy" is 27, and reported to be the head of USA (United Software
 Alliance), which  is considered by some to be the current top
 "cracking" group in the country. If memory serves, "ENTERPRISE BBS"
 was the USA homeboard.  She was questioned for about 10 hours, and
 "cooperated." She has, as of Saturday (Feb 9) *not* yet talked to an
 attorney, although she was put in contact with one late Saturday. The
 prosecutor in Oakland County is the same one who is prosecuting Dr.
 Kavorkian (of "suicide machine" fame). He has a reputation as
 excessively harsh, and his demeanor in television interviews does not
 contradict this.

 The other two defendants, "Mike/The Grim Reaper," and "Tom/Genesis"
 are from the Detroit and Los Angeles areas.

 What are the issues relevant for us?

 My own radiclib concern is with over-criminalization created by
 imposing a label onto a variety of disparate behaviors and then
 invoking the full weight of the system against the label instead of
 the behaviors. It is fully possible to oppose the behaviors while
 recognizing that the current method of labelling, processing, and
 punishment may not be wise. Len Rose provides an example of how
 unacceptable but relatively benign behaviors lead to excessive
 punishment. This, however, is a broader social issue of which
 computer-related crimes is simply a symptom.

 Of more direct relevance:

 1) It appears that the continued use of massive force and weaponry
    continues. We've discussed this before in alluding to cases in New
    York, Illinois, Texas, and California. The video tape of the bust
    of the "Hollywood Hacker" resembles a Miami Vice episode: A
    middle-aged guy is confronted with an army of yelling weapons with
    guns drawn charging through the door.  Others on the board have
    reported incidences of being met with a shotgun while stepping out
    of the shower, a gun to the head while in bed, and (my favorite) a
    15 year old kid busted while working on his computer and the
    agent-in-charge put her gun to his head and reportedly said, "touch
    that keyboard and die." The use of such force in this type of bust
    is simply unacceptable because of the potential danger (especially
    in multi-jurisdictional busts, which reduces the precision of
    coordination) of accidental violence.

 2. Until indictments and supporting evidence are made public, we
    cannot be sure what the occured. But, it seems clear that, for
    "Amy" at least, we are not dealing with a major felon.  Carding is
    obviously wrong, but I doubt that, in situations such as this,
    heavy-duty felony charges are required to "teach a lesson," "set
    an example," and re-channel behavior into more productive outlets.

 3. We can continue to debate the legal and ethical implications of
    software piracy. There is a continuum from useful and fully
    justifiable "creative sharing" to heavy-duty predatory rip-off for
    profit. This case seems to be the former rather than the latter.
    There is no sound reason for treating extreme cases alike.

 3. We should all be concerned about how LE frames and dramatizes such
    cases for public consumption. The Farmington newspaper gave it
    major coverage as a national crime of immense proportions. We
    should all be concerned about how piracy cases are handled, because
    even extreme cases have implications for minor ones. Does
    possession of an unauthorized copy of Aldus Pagemaker and Harvard
    Graphics, collective worth more than $1,000, really constitute a
    major "theft"? We have seen from the cases of Len and Craig how
    evaluation of a product is inflated to justify indictments that
    look serious but in fact are not.

 I'm not sure what purpose it serves to simply assert that people--even
 if guilty of carding or piracy--should "get what's coming to them"
 without reflecting on what it is they get and why.  The issue isn't
 one of coddling or protecting "criminals," but to examine more
 carefully what kinds of computer-related crimes should be
 criminalized, which should be torts, and which should be accepted as
 minor nuisances and--if not ignored--at least not criminalized.

 To give the dead horse one last kick: I am not arguing that we condone
 behaviors. I am only suggesting that we reflect more carefully on how
 we respond to such behaviors. I do not know the circumstances of "Tom"
 and "Mike," but "Amy's" case raises many issues we can address without
 condoning the behavior.

 Section [3]: QUICK COMMENT ON BUST
              By: MERCENARY

   CUD does not name its sources, but the following article in section
  four appears to Substantiate the Article supplied to our Headquarters BBS.
  by an Anonymous Donor.
   Although the article claims Five Men were detained, its suprising in its
  similarity of the original article supplied to us.
   Even the file Circulating By The NotSoHumble Babe says the members were
  going to pick up their carded packages.
   At the time of this printing, We're trying to prepare an interview with
  One of the busted members.
   In closing please read section Four and try to formulate your own
  conclusions.

 Dateline: Livonia Observer, Monday, February 3, 1992 , Volume 52 Number 1

               AUTHORITIES CRACK NATIONAL COMPUTER FRAUD RING

 In a continuous 36-hour investigation, Farmington Hills Police, U.S.
 Secret Service and Michigan State Police cracked what is believed to be a
 nationwide computer fraud ring operating from Farmington Hills and involving
 men from Livonia, Canton, Plymouth.

 Farmington Hills police briefly detained the five men, who they say agreed
 Thursday to cooperate with the investigation.

 Oakland County and federal prosecutors are reviewing the case to determine
 what charges will be filed against the five men - two from Livonia, one form
 Farmington Hills, one from Plymouth and one from Canton, said Farmington Hills
 Det. Sgt. Charles Nebus.

 The five men were not identified pending arrest and arraignment.

 "They are computer hackers," said Farmington Hills Det. Patrick Monti.  "They
 have a high level of expertise in computers."

 Members of the alleged fraud ring apparently gained access to computers of
 credit reporting companies and used information, such as credit card numbers,
 credit limit, card balance, and card holder names, to order computer
 equipment, Monti said.

 Purchases of computer equipment were billed to people who had no idea their
 credit card numbers and information were being used to place the orders, Monti
 said.

 The 36-hour investigation began early Wednesday, Jan. 29, with a telephone
 call to Farmington Hills police from a computer company with offices in Hawaii
 and Texas.

 Company officials told police they believed they had a fraudulent order that
 led to Farmington Hills.

 Police got in touch with Federal Express in Novi where packages where expected
 to arrive.  Dectectives Monti, Tim Swanson and David Loe conducted
 surveillance of the area. They saw three men in three cars arrive to pick up
 packages from the computer company, Monti said.

 Detectives followed the men to a Farmington Hills apartment where a fourth man
 was waiting. "At that time we confronted the occupants of the apartment.  And
 they agreed to cooperate with us." Monti said.

 Police surveillance continued to Meijer Thrifty Acres at Eight Mile and
 Haggerty roads, Northville Township, where the Canton man - considered to be
 the brains behind the operation - retrieved the packages, Nebus said.

 "It was a ring of people with the man in Canton as the main actor.  He placed
 the orders and others delivered the packages to him."

 Police recovered packages, valued at about $20,000, ordered by the ring.

 Forfeiture proceedings are expected to intitiated on equipment owned by one of
 the men in the ring.  The other packages of computers will be returned to the
 companies from which they were ordered, Monti said.

 "We determined all the packages we picked up were fraudulent," Monti added.
 "When they would go to Federal Express they would sign the name of the person
 (whose credit card numbers they used) for the packages.

 Farmington Hills police, Secret Service officers and the Michigan State
 Police searched the Canton man's house Thursday.

 "The Canton man placed the orders and advised a Farmington Hills man to go to
 Federal Express in Novi and pick up the packages," Monti said. "It is our
 belief they were selling the computers."

 The ring would make use of what is called a "bulletin board," which is
 computer information available throughout the country.  While using the
 bulletin board is not illegal, the information ring members used is, Monti
 said.

 "The detectives did an outstanding job," Nebus said. "From the time the
 information came in, these guys really had to scramble. I credit them with
 doing an excellent job on surveillance."

 Nebus also credited Federal Express. "We really depend on them a lot.  They're
 good folks to work with."

 Section [7]: FireCrackers Part I
              By: Saint Anarchy/D.O.A.

       FireCrackers are so simple to make that many books on fireworks
      often ingnore them.
       There are two main types of FireCrackers, but many different mixtures
      or powder formulas.
       This month I will only look at the "GIANT" FireCracker Class.
       Handmade "GIANT" FireCrackers are made by first rolling paper around
      a 3/4 inch wooden dowel until the paper is 1/8 inch thick. This is the
      casing of the FireCracker.
       The best paper to use is from a brown paper grocery bag. It is cut into
      the desired width and length to make 1/8 inch when rolled.
      On the last layer of the rolling process, the paper is glued and the
      completed paper tube is slipped off the dowel.
       1/4 Inch thick slice of the dowel is used to plug the end. The plug
      for the fuse end is drilled to allow for the fuse. The plugs are smeared
      with glue before being pressed into the end of the tube. More glue is
      squeezed around the fuse after being inserted.
       In all the directions I have for making giant FireCrackers, it is
      recommended that they be filled only about 1/3 full. It is generally
      accepted that completely filled ones are not as loud as 1/3 filled
      tubes.
       If you choose to only fill the tube 1/3 of the way, make sure you
      insert the fuse deep enough as to reach the powder.
      Adequate FireCrackers can be made with commercial gun powder, pistol
      powder being the best to use,but even shotgun powder will do.
      In Part II next month will look at complete powder formulas and
      the second class of FireCrackers.

  A man apparently irritated by the amount of time his son spent using a
 Computer was arrested after firing seven shots into the machine, police said.
  Charles R. Hubbard,44,of Spokane was arrested late Tuesday for investigation
 of assault, He was released Wednesday after posting $20,000 Bail.
  "He appeared to be upset because his son was unemployed and all he did was
 mess with that -qoute- "STUPID" computer" police Sgt. Al Odenthal said.
  The assault charge was for allegedly pointing a .45-caliber semi-automatic
 handgun at his son, Odenthal said.
  "Im not sure if its against the law to shoot property in your own home,"

   Phantasy Note: It appears that MIT is having similar woes to Prodigy
                  of Anti-Semitic Messages being placed on-line
                  The following two letters have appeared in "The Tech",
                  Volume 112,Number 5, (an MIT Newspaper).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 LETTER ONE:

                 FREE SPEECH DOES NOT PROTECT ETHNIC "JOKES"

      Freedom of speech and the privilege of attending an institution like
     MIT imply, (but do not always require), responsibility.
     As MIT's president, it often falls to me to defend freedom of speech
     and academic freedom on our campus. I do so gladly and with conviction,
     because it is important that our campus and society allow people to give
     voice to difficult questions and analyses that may differ radically from
     the norm.
      Such defenses begin to ring hollow, however, when individuals engage in
     mindless,offensive,and hurtful behavior just to "prove a point".
     This is precisely how I would characterize the use of computer bulletin
     boards by an MIT student to disseminate repugnant ethnic "jokes".
      Surely those who exercise freedom of speech have a responsibility to
     consider the consequences of what they say. Disparaging remarks about
     certain groups within our cumminity are hurtful to those individuals
     and diminish us all.

                                                 President
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 LETTER TWO:

             COMPUTER NETWORK NOT THE PLACE FOR ANTI-SEMITIC HUMOR

      I'm deeply disturbed about reports that at least one student at MIT
     is using the computer network to broadcast misogynist and anti-semitic
     jokes, even holocaust jokes.
      The use of our communications technology in this way can only diminish
     and dehumanize the members of some groups in the eyes of others. To
     dehumanize is a precursor to harassment, and even to persecution and
     terror. If individuals want to demean themselves by telling such
     jokes in private, they are free to do so. But to use MIT communication
     facilities to greatly amplify the audience for such jokes should not be
     considered acceptable behavior at MIT.
      It is difficult enough to create a community of civility and caring
     where people feel safe to share and learn without being confonted with
     such ugly assault.

     DIGITAL ANNOUNCES THE ALPHA OPEN COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE,
                THE WORLD'S FASTEST MICROPROCESSOR,
                    AND NEW BUSINESS PRACTICES


    ...Lays the foundation for 21st century network computing
               with a solid bridge from the present.


HUDSON, MA -- February 25, 1992 -- Digital Equipment Corporation
today announced Alpha, its program for 21st century computing.
According to Kenneth H. Olsen, President of Digital Equipment
Corporation, "Alpha is a totally new, open computing
architecture that will be the foundation for advanced 21st
century computing.  It will give computer users a clear and
consistent growth path from today's computing technology to the
benefits of advanced 21st century computer technology.  The
Alpha program is a major element in the new, more competitive
Digital Equipment Corporation, and we believe it will
significantly fuel Digital's growth in the coming years."
"This new architecture will, over time, address the needs
of a broad range of computer users by providing systems that
span the desktop to the supercomputer.  Alpha will offer users
the flexibility to deploy current applications on popular
operating environments, beginning with OSF/1 and VMS.  It will
enhance and extend the capability of today's Digital products.
Customers can continue to buy today's leadership VMS and UNIX
systems from Digital knowing they have a clear entry path into
21st century computing," added William Demmer, vice president of
Digital's VAX VMS Systems and Servers group.  "The beauty of
Alpha is that it opens the future with a solid bridge from the
present," he added.

Announced today were:

o The Alpha architecture.  This advanced, full 64-bit
  Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture is
  optimized for speed, engineered to support multiple
  operating systems, and designed to increase performance
  by a factor of 1000 over its anticipated 25-year life.

o The first Alpha product  -- Digital's 21064-AA RISC
  microprocessor.  This 150-MegaHertz microprocessor is the
  first in a family of full 64-bit chips with address space
  many thousands of times larger than 32-bit
  implementations from IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun.  The
  new chip has demonstrated performance at 200 MegaHertz,
  and over time Digital will offer versions of this
  microprocessor at various speeds.

  Evaluation quantities of the 21064-AA microprocessor are
  available now.  It is priced at $3375 each in units of 1
  to 100; $1650 in units of 101 to 1,000; and $1559 for
  over 1,000. Quantity shipments will begin in July, 1992.

  The new RISC microprocessor chips are manufactured at the
  company's high-volume, state-of-the-art manufacturing
  plants in Hudson, Massachusetts, and South Queensferry,
  Scotland.

o New business practices to achieve the broadest possible
  use of the Alpha architecture, and to make the widest
  range of software available on Alpha.  Digital will sell
  Alpha at all levels of integration  --  chip, board, and
  system -- to other computer companies and to OEMs.
  Digital also will license its operating systems
  (including DEC OSF/1 and VMS), compilers, and layered
  software products.

  To ensure a broad applications portfolio, Digital is
  offering a comprehensive support program to help leading
  software companies quickly move up to Alpha.  Thirty
  Alpha Upgrade Centers are being located in the US, Europe
  and Asian Rim, staffed by software support personnel with
  expertise in VMS, ULTRIX, and DEC OSF/1.  Complete
  documentation, seminars and training session are
  available now, and seed Alpha system will be available
  this summer.  The Alpha Upgrade Program already is
  underway with many leading software companies.  Major
  vendors supporting the Alpha platform will be highlighted
  at DECWORLD '92 beginning in April.

o A variety of ways for customers to enhance their VMS and
  UNIX computing environments with Alpha.  Customers can
  develop and run applications on today's leadership VAX
  and DECsystem products with the assurance that they
  easily will be able to add Alpha systems into their
  computing environments.  Alpha systems will provide data,
  image, source code, and user interface compatibility with
  VAX systems running open VMS and DECsystem products
  running DEC OSF/1.  Alpha systems will network with these
  products to share information and processing tasks, and
  will work in VAXcluster configurations.  Common buses for
  VAX, DECsystem, and Alpha systems means that many
  peripherals will be able to be used between systems.

o A complete portfolio of service programs for users and
  other vendors who incorporate Alpha technology into their
  products.  Digital will support customers with services
  ranging from consulting to training, systems management,
  and integration and upgrade services.  Digital will
  support vendors during product design and implementation.
  Through OEMs, VARs, or direct distribution channels,
  Digital also will provide services for vendors'
  Alpha-based products.

Alpha will extend the ability of Digital's current software
systems environment to address major business opportunities.
Supercomputer or large mainframe  applications -- seismic data
analysis, econometric forecasting, molecular modeling,
engineering design verification, and many others -- will be able
to run on Alpha at a fraction of traditional mainframe price per
unit of performance.  Alpha will expand the market for networks
of high performance distributed production systems and servers,
replacing mainframes.  The powerful new single-chip Alpha
microprocessor will open new markets for embedded OEM
applications and board-level products.  Alpha will provide the
power for emerging personal use applications that are beyond the
capability of most of today's PCs, such as voice and video,
visualization systems, imaging, and artificial intelligence.
With Digital's NAS (Network Application Support), customers will
have the flexibility to integrate leading-edge, Alpha-based
applications with their current applications environment.
"Alpha is based on the expertise Digital has gained from 35
years of providing systems and networking based on leadership
architectural design," noted Robert B.Palmer, Digital's vice
president of manufacturing.  "In addition, Digital has 15 years
of experience in designing and delivering chip technology,
including leading-edge CMOS technology.  We have some of the
industry's most advanced fabrication technology, and most
experienced chip design teams using a leading-edge suite of CAD
tools, involved in delivering the world's fastest RISC
microprocessor."

                    CYBERTEK: The Cyberpunk Technical Journal
                        P.O. Box 64, Brewster, NY 10509

                               What is CYBERTEK?
                            by Thomas Icom, editor

    CYBERTEK is The Cyberpunk Technical Journal.  Our first issue was printed
in April, 1990.  We publish an issue once every two months.  CYBERTEK is an
informational and discussion forum for technological enthusiasts/survivalists/
activists, and others whose desire is to maximize their freedom and be able to
function as free citizens in a totalitarian society.
    CYBERTEK was created because within the past years, The United States,
once the model of freedom, has slid downward to become more and more of a
totalitarian state.  With this downward slide has been the withholding from
the people of certain knowledge and information which is essential to have if
they desire to exist as free citizens in a free country.  An ignorant populace
is very easy for a tyrant to keep down, but people who are knowledgeable in
the ways and means to live independently and fight totalitarianism are
impossible for despotic state to have control over.  As James Madison, the
father of the U.S. Constitution, once said, "A people to mean to be their own
governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives."
    CYBERTEK's primary objective is the dissemination of easy to understand by
the average person technological survival information.  This is also better
known in Cyberpunk literature as "street tech".  This covers, but is not
limited to, COMPUTERS, ELECTRONICS, PHONES, ENERGY, WEAPONS, CHEMISTRY,
SECURITY, FINANCIAL, and HEALTH/MEDICAL.  Knowledge of these topics is
necessary for anyone seeking self-reliance and personal independence in
today's world; as well as for preparing for any "unforeseen circumstances".
    The secondary  objective of CYBERTEK is the discussion of political,
libertarian, populist, alternative & underground culture and opinions.  It is
our aim to allow people to exercise their First Amendment right to freedom of
speech and discuss their opinions and views.  In this respect, if we print a
submission, it will be printed unedited, uncensored, and in it's entirety.
Unlike the majority of the traditional mass newsmedia, CYBERTEK takes the bill
of rights seriously, and will prove it.
    CYBERTEK is published for educational purposes only under The First
Amendment of The United States Constitution.  The subject matter, while
controversial in the eyes of some, is 100% legal to own in the United States.
Although some of the information presented in CYBERTEK could be used in an
illegal manner, no illegal acts are suggested or implied.
    Subscriptions to CYBERTEK are $15 a year for six issues.  Sample issues
are $2.50.  Payment is by check, M/O (recommended), or by cash (not
recommended.  do at own risk).  You can send payment to the address at the top
of this textfile.

We were busted today, by some Secret Service guys and some FBI people..
This is no bull shit, they were here and made me delete everything I had and
get rid of all my disks or they were going to take my hardware with them.

There is no hidden section anywhere on this system, from now on everything is
Public Domain.. IE: Gifs,mods, stuff like that. When I get done cleaning the
place of all my disks I will re-do the system to make the sections look right.

They have my user log, so change your passwords. I am not helping them bust
other boards or narcing on anyone, this is our deal and we will pay the price.

I hope that all of you continue to call here, I will try to run the board the
best I can.. We will go multi node soon as things settle down. And we will run
a large gif section as they told me that was ok to do.

   Association. Call 202-364-8252 to learn more about viruses and what you
   can do to fight them.



    The Michelangelo virus is based on the Stoned virus replication
   process and is extremely destructive.  It was only discovered in
   mid-1991, but it has spread extremely rapidly across the United
   States.  Recently, several major companies have shipped products
   infected with the virus.  Among these are Leading Edge Products,
   who shipped up to 6000 infected machines [San Francisco
   Chronicle, 25 Jan 1992], and DaVinci Systems, who shipped about
   900 infected demo disks to customers and resellers [Virus-L Digest,
   Feb 4 1992].

    One of the major reasons for the growth in the number of
   Michelangelo infections is the fact that the virus is new and is
   undetectable by recently outdated scanners.  Additionally, it is
   based on the same efficient replication process found in the Stoned
   virus, which is the most common virus in the United States today. 
   Finally, the virus presents no messages to the user and so masks its
   presence until triggered.

    On March 6 of any year the virus will overwrite the hard disk with
   random information found in memory.  The portions of the disk
   overwritten include the FAT (File Allocation Table) and Master
   Boot Record (MBR).  Recovery from the damage caused by the
   virus is extremely difficult, if not impossible.  For this reason,
   users should remember to keep updated backups and to check their
   systems for the presence of the virus before March 6.

    The virus infects the boot sectors of floppy disks and the master
   boot records of hard disks.  When a system is booted from an
   infected disk, the virus will place itself into memory and infect the
   hard disk (if not already infected).  The virus occupies about 2K
   (2048 bytes) of memory while resident, decreasing the available
   memory reported by DOS accordingly.  While resident in memory,
   any action which accesses a floppy disk (via interrupt 13h) will
   cause that disk to become infected.  The virus places itself in the
   last sector of the area on the diskette reserved for the root directory
   entries.  Therefore, a disk with a full (or nearly full) root directory
   may experience an immediate data loss.  Similarly, data loss can
   occur on an infected hard disk when the virus moves the original
   master boot record to a new location.  Some reports indicate that
   the virus mis-interprets the Disk Parameter Block of 1.44 MB
   floppies, causing them to return the message "Invalid Media" when
   accessed again.  Note that every floppy disk has a boot sector,
   regardless of whether or not it is a bootable disk.  Therefore, any
   floppy disk can be a carrier of the virus.

    Michelangelo is relatively easy to remove.  Before performing any
   disinfection, cold boot the machine with a clean, write protected
   diskette.  To disinfect floppies, use the DOS "SYS" command to
   place a new boot sector on the disk.  Syntax is "SYS X:", where 
   X is the drive containing the infected diskette.  The only easy way
   to remove a hard disk infection with DOS is to use the DOS 5.0
   FDISK program.  Use only DOS 5.0 for this procedure; all other
   versions may destroy data!  Type "FDISK /MBR" to remove the
   virus by rebuilding the MBR. 

    All major recent anti-virus packages should be able to reliably
   remove the virus.  Two shareware products available on the NCSA
   BBS (202-364-1304 8/n/1) are SCAN/CLEAN from McAfee
   Associates and F-Prot from FRISK software.  With Clean, type
   "CLEAN X: [mich]", where X is the infected drive.  With F-Prot,
   type "F-Prot /Auto /Disinf X:", where X is the infected drive.  Call
   NCSA at 202-364-8252 for free help in removing this and any
   infection.

        OK,

                In Dayton Ohio we have a little problem.  A few months ago,
someone pulled up this pd sysop's credit report, who was getting on our nerves
with his anti-virus shit.  Anyways..  over $7000 worth of charges were put on
his credit cards.  Some shit was sent to his house.  But still I think it's
$6300 is still unaccounted for.
        From there on, the PD has pretty much declared war on the underground.
They have formed a group called LPACHUL with the main constituant being Hells
Furrie.  Hells Furrie gets information from narcs in the underground, and also
get's people to try to infiltrate the underground boards.  Then they capture
everything they see and put it in these newsletters.
        I've locked out probably 10-15 people who could be narcs.  I know a lot
of other people have locked out a lot more also.  I'm trying to run a not so
super elite board.  But one with Phreak Klass, Hack Klass and trying to teach
the 'lamers' how to get around and not look like idiots.
        What I'm asking is this.  We've done all kinds of shit.  We played up
and made them look like idiots by creating a group called Smells Furrie and
made newsletters like Hells Furries' but with everythign turned around.  We
made annoyance dialers that would call the sysops home fone number.  We made
programs that plain made fun of the pd.  And passed it around the pd.  We had
the main guy's fone disconnected (Al Lee).  He got it reconnected the next day.
We've tryed a lot of shit.  But they still keep coming. And each newsletter
they put out exposes more and more about the underground..
        So.  We tryed to control it, but I think their views maybe nationwide.
That they might want to take down h/p and warez boards around the country.  If
we don't stop them now, they may start telling other people in other towns to
try the same thing.
        This is a big problem.  So I'm asking for EVERYONE's help.  If you can
infiltrate their boards, and trash/crash them.  Send shit to their house.
Cause general Anarchy we can win this war.  It's getting out of control.  And I
think that WE NEED TO STOP IT!
        So..  If you guys would like to terrorize, here is an address.

        [IIRG Edited]

        Dayton Ohio 45414
        Home Fone Number [IIRG Edited]
        Data Fone Number [IIRG Edited]

        His board is called [IIRG Edited].  He is butt buddies with John
McAffee and sends every file he gets to McAfee to get it checked out and shit.
He passes around all them damn virus scanners and cleaners and shit, which make
it hard to trash boards.



        Get this guy first.  I'll have more address and fone numbers soon!

Well, tonight at around 10:00 I got a call from my friend Genghis Khan, yes
the one who is on my board and always posting on this net.  It turns out that
today, he recieved a visit from the Secret Service and the Sheriif.   They
confiscated about everything, his computer, all his disks, papers, printer, and
everything else.  He was busted for hacking and using the 1-800-733-5000
extender and for pulling CBI's.   It turns out that the head PD guy that we
have been telling all of you about, reported him and there was also a narc (who
we are almost positive was THE ENFORCER a.k.a THE PREVENTOR a.ka. Dave Rowe)

I don;t have much time right now to go into further detail, but i will post
more tommorrow and when i talk to him again.  Along with Genghis, TERM INAL,
was also busted, and possibly others.   IF YOU RUN A SYSTEM OR ARE ON A SYSTEM
THAT HAS EITHER OF THESE USERS, I WOULD RECOMEND DELETING THEIR ACCOUNTS,
BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE CALLING ANYMORE.  Please let people know that 733's
and CBI have busted them, and play it safe.
