 Section [2]: NYX Tightening Security

  From the System Administrator of NYX.CS.DU.EDU 

   [Synopsis of what happened late November 1992.]

  A vandal, completely and irresponsibly wiped out the "password" file (Unix's
 list of all users) after finding a means to break into the "Superuser"
 level of the system; this crippled the system for days since your friendly
 sys admin was out of town, and caused him much grief upon return.
  This vandal claims it was an accident, but that doesn't
 alter the fact that it should never have happened; the only way to avoid
 accidents like this is not to be doing anything where an accident could
 be harmful.  His breakin is intolerably irresponsible.  
 [Further note that crackers like this rarely understand what they're doing; 
 they just follow instructions for breaking in often written by the people 
 who are trying to fix the holes.  
 Most crackers are not above average intelligence; indeed, based on the messes
 they cause, I tend to think of them as below average.  
 Breaking in does not impress me!]
 
 Other recent problems have been the rash of crank accounts -- phoney names
 used to harrass other users or cause other kinds of problems.

 These events are the direct cause of Nyx moving toward full validation of
 all users, grrrrr.

 Grow up, people!  Think about someone other than yourself for once!


 IIRG NOTE :  The IIRG has found numerous referrals to this "Accident",

             ---------------------------------------------------------
       
       If you are on NYX , We here at the IIRG would suggest changing your

 Section [4]: Randy Weaver Follow-Up

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Part 1 : UNDECLARED WAR AGAINST CHRISTIAN AMERICANS
                             By: Jack McLamb

    Jack McLamb, a retired lawman from Phoenix, Arizona, was on the 
scene at the bloody siege of the Randy Weaver household in northern 
Idaho. He arrived with Lt. Col. James "Bo" Gritz, who together with 
McLamb established contact with the Weavers and defused a situation 
that would have turned even more bloody had they not intervened. This 
is McLamb's dramatic account, told here in the first person, drawn 
from his interview on the September 2 broadcast of Radio Free 
America. McLamb has been investigating a similar incident resulting 
in the death by incineration of Gordon Kahl in Arkansas at the hands 
of federal officers. He begins his narrative account on the day of 
the first shootings. The transcript follows: 

          ------------------------------------------

    On Friday, August 21, six federal officers were conducting 
surveillance on Randy Weaver's cabin. They were on the property, and 
they had no legal reason to be there. They were not there to serve a 
warrant of any kind. 
    What happened was that the Weavers' dogs picked up their scent. 
These gentlemen were in full camouflage uniforms, meaning that you 
could walk right by them in the forest and never see them. However, 
the dogs began chasing them. 
    When Randy, Samuel [his 14-year-old son] and Kevin Harris 
[a young friend who had been living with the Weaver family since his 
early teens] heard the dogs barking, they did what mountain men do: 
Tney grabbed their guns, thinking that there might be an antelope, an 
elk, game of some kind, in the vicinity. 
    Kevin and Samuel went to the forest. Randy took the road. They 
expected to encircle the animal. Kevin and Samuel ran into the 
camouflaged men. The dogs, of course, were going after these 
strangers on the property. The marshals turned around and killed one 
of the family dogs, in fact, Samuel's favorite dog which he had 
raised and trained from a pup. It was trained to carry water from the 
creek up to the home on a sled during the heavy winters up there in
the mountain.
    Young Sam, not knowing who these men were, yelled, "You're 
killing my dog," and opened fire on them. Sam was then shot in the 
shoulder, and as he turned around to run to the cabin he took a bullet 
in the middle of his back, and it killed him instantly. 
    Kevin went over and took Sam's pulse and found that he was dead 
and then opened fire on these men who had killed Sam and who had not 
announced what they were doing. 
    Randy heard this happening from the road. Just about this time, 
two of these camouflage-clothed men came out of the woods and said, 
"Randy, you're under arrest." 
    Randy started running back to the cabin, fired his gun a number 
of times, and yelled to Kevin and Sam to "Get back to the cabin." He 
met Kevin at the cabin, who told him that his boy had been killed by 
these men. At that point they barricaded themselves in the cabin. 
    Now, Randy had called Bo Gritz the month before. They knew each 
other from Fort Bragg when Randy was a Special Forces soldier. He 
asked Bo to come up and help him since he was afraid that the 
government was going to come in and destroy his family. Bo was on the 
campaign trail and was extremely busy and could not go. 
    Well, Tuesday of last week [August 25], I was sitting at lunch 
with Bo when he described to me how bad he felt about not having gone 
up there when Randy called. By this time we had heard about the 
barricade situation and the loss of the marshal's life in the news. 
However, I had no idea that Bo knew him [Randy]. 
    Bo was quite distraught and kept saying, "I should have 
responded. I should have responded." Then he said, "I want to ask you 
something. If I were to go up there now, would you go with me as my 
backup? I want to go up there and see if I can help Randy and his 
family." 
    So I agreed to go
    We put everything on hold, and by Wednesday, August 26, we were 
there in Idaho. We went straight to the roadblock and announced 
ourselves to the 300 or so supporters of the family who were there. 
    As a police officer, I've been in riots, and this situation was 
very tense. The people were in a very bad mood. And on the other side 
of the roadblock were about 1OO Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms [BATF] officers, FBI officers and Idaho State Police 
officers. The officers were on edge and ready to go to war against 
these people. 
    These people were friends and neighbors of the Weavers. They knew 
that the Weavers were no bother to anyone. There were witnesses who 
told us that they had seen a helicopter hovering around the mountain 
top carrying a fuel bladder, to drop on the cabin and set it ablaze. 
We didn't see it, but this is what they told us, and shows that the 
crowd had good reason to be concerned about the family's safety. 
    When Bo got out of the car, it was amazing. They calmed right 
down. Bo spoke to them and told them why he was there--to try to save 
the rest of the family and get them out of there. 
    Then he approached the barricade and told the soldiers that he 
wanted to talk to the FBI man in charge. That was Special Agent Gene 
Glenn. They sent the message up to the top of the mountain, but Glenn 
said he was too busy. 
    We stayed there until Friday, and Glenn was still too busy. But I 
know that when you've got somebody surrounded in a building and 
control the perimeter of the area you've got nothing but time on your 
hands. I knew and Bo knew that Glenn just didn't want to have 
anything to do with him. 
    It was also on Thursday that [radio personality] Paul Harvey--not 
knowing either Bo or Randy or their relationship--got on the news and 
said, "Randy, if you are listening, do not have anything to do with 
the people coming up to see you. They are there for political 
ambition. Please pick up the telephone outside your cabin and call me 
and talk to me, and I'll make sure you get the best lawyer in the 
country." 
    He was, of course, talking about Bo. 
    However, when Randy looked out the door of the cabin, he saw a 
robot that they sent up carrying a telephone and monitoring the cabin 
with a camera. Mounted on the other side of the phone was a 12-gauge 
shotgun. So Randy would have thought twice about reaching out and 
picking up the telephone that Paul Harvey was urging him to pick up. 
    Obviously, it was kind of disturbing that Paul had said Bo was 
going out there for "political gain." 
    In any case, luckily, Randy didn't even hear Paul Harvey. Just 
imagine what would have happened had Randy not known Bo that much, 
and he might not have communicated with Bo, based upon what Paul 
Harvey was saying. 
    It was a very serious thing for Paul Harvey to have done. We 
didn't understand why. 
    On Friday we had been there for 2 1/2 days waiting for Gene 
Glenn. The FBI had had no success whatsoever in communicating with 
Randy, so by Friday afternoon Bo was getting angry. He knew that he 
could have a dialog with Randy, and Randy had asked him to come up. 
    At this point, Bo put together citizen's arrest warrants to 
arrest the head of the FBI, the head of the U.S. Marshal's Service, 
the governor of Idaho, and FBI agent in charge Gene Glenn. At about 
1 o'clock on Friday we approached the roadblock and read aloud the 
citizen's arrest forms and the indictments and asked the persons to
step forward [to be served].
    Bo had requested that the people in Hawaii who had first 
described this citizen's arrest tactic on your show fax him the 
information. So they did so, and Bo served those people in the 
afternoon on the barricade. 
   We did this in a legal fashion, since I, as a police officer, know 
how to do it. Bo read the indictment and the charges, and asked the 
people or their representatives to step forward. No one did. So then 
we placed the papers under a rock and placed them on the other side 
of the barricade. Service was complete. 
    Then the county attorney came through, read the papers and said 
they were of no effect--that they just weren't any good. But within 
half an hour, Special Agent Gene Glenn called for Bo, and he was 
transported to the top of the mountain on Friday afternoon and made 
the first contact with Randy that had been made throughout the 
ordeal. 
    If the papers were of "no effect," something sure moved Special 
Agent Glenn. 
    Bo spent the evening up there talking to Randy, and he came back 
and reported to those of us at the roadblock. The crowd had calmed 
down considerably, and the po]ice at the roadblock told me that they 
were very appreciative that Bo had come. They were thinking there was 
going to be quite a riot. 
    I stood at the front of the roadblock, and because I was a police 
officer myself I had good communication with the other officers there. 
    This was good for all concerned, because the scene was getting 
out of hand. The BATF and FBI officers thanked us for the calming 
effect we had on the crowd. These men were not intimidated by the 
fact that Bo and I had come. 
    Those on the mountain, the higher management people, were not too 
pleased that Bo had come, but they were quite amazed that he had 
picked up the ball and started talking to Randy, and Randy started 
responding. They didn't know that Randy and Bo had a good 
relationship. 
    Bo came back down about 9:30 that night and told the crowd that 
he had good news and bad. The good news was that Kevin was still 
alive, although shot and seriously injured. The bad was that Vicki 
Weaver was killed last Saturday by a sniper bullet to the head. Now 
when Bo told the people what had happened, it was quite a shock, and
even the officers on the gate who had heard this for the first time 
were shaken. All of the officers I talked to were very upset that the 
special operations unit of the Marshal's Service which was on the 
property illegally had really instigated this terrible tragedy. They 
were upset and knew this was wrong. 
    Vicki was killed the day that she and her family had prepared 
their dead son's body for burial. In accordance with the Old 
Testament they wrapped his body in white clothing and had taken him 
to an outbuilding beside the house. Kevin and Randy went to the 
outbuilding to be with the boy's body for prayer, and a sniper shot 
Randy through the arm. He told Kevin to run for the cabin, and they 
did, not returning fire. 
    As they reached the cabin, Vicki had opened the door and was 
holding the eight-month-old baby, Elishaba, in her arms. As Randy and 
Kevin ran by her, she was shot through the head by a sniper using a 
highpowered rifle. She fell dead on the floor, dropping the baby, who 
was not injured. Now there were three people who had been wounded. 
    Vicki had not yet died. Kevin, however, was struck by shrapnel 
and probably bone particles from Vicki's injury. Bo looked at the 
hole in the building and realized that it was probably a .300 Magnum 
rifle, a very high powered rifle. That kind of rifle could be shot 
from about 300 yards without missing the target. We're not sure how 
far away the sniper was. 
    Randy helped the girls put the mother under the kitchen table, 
and that's where she lay for the next 10 days, and they barricaded 
themselves in the cabin. They did not come out until the 11th day. 
    On Saturday, after Bo had told the crowd that Vicki was dead, Bo 
took a local preacher and a friend of the girls named Jackie up to 
the cabin. Jackie was able to start a dialog with the girls: Sarah,
16, Rachel, who turned 11 during the time they were up there, and, 
there was, of course, eight-month-old Elishaba. 
    When Bo came down on Saturday evening, he told me that Randy had 
heard on the radio that they were spendirg $1 million a day to tap 
his phone. Randy said that they should take the money and "give it to 
Jack McLamb to investigate the Gordon Kahl case." 
    Neither Bo nor I knew that he even knew of me. Well, Bo told 
Randy that I was down at the bottom of the mountain, and Randy said 
that he'd love to talk to me. Then I went up and was able to speak 
for quite a long time to Randy. It was good to be able to talk to 
Randy and the girls. 
    The FBI man in charge, Gene Glenn, was happy that we were able to 
get Randy talking. They had been there and had been unable to get him 
to talk. 
    We went back up on Sunday morning, and by around noon, Bo had 
talked Kevin into ]eaving the house. He knew he would die if he didn't 
get medical assistance. We had called up a National Guard doctor. Now 
the young Weaver girls, who were very well trained in medical 
treatment and survival by their parents, took his vital signs and 
made a list of his injuries. The girls gave this information to the 
doctor who made a diagnosis that Kevin needed immediate treatment 
because his lung was filling up with blood. 
    When I entered that house for the first time, I was shocked. It 
looked like a tomb. The air was stale, the windows had been blocked, 
and they hadn't seen sunlight for some 10 days. It was macabre. I had 
never seen anything like it. 
    These young people had been in the house with their dead mother's 
body in the kitchen for 10 days. Randy's arm was festering terribly 
and smelling very bad. In the meantime, we put Kevin in a rocking 
chair on the front porch. 
    The minute Bo and I saw the young faces of these beautiful little 
girls, tears started running down their faces, and Bo and I just 
burst out crying. Sarah put her arms up to me, and I hugged her and 
told her I loved her. Rachel put her arms around Bo. Randy started 
crying, and we hugged him and told him we loved him. We spent a few 
minutes there, just stroking their heads and telling them we would 
get them out safely. 
    [McLamb's voice breaks, he is momentarily overcome, and then 
resumes his narration.] 
    You can't imagine what they've been through. One minute they were 
a whole family. The next minute the family was pretty much destroyed. 
    Now the FBI had promised that Kevin would not be handcuffed and 
that I could accompany him all the way to the hospital in Spokane. I 
patted him down and made certain that he had no weapons. Then, Bo and 
I got Kevin down to a stretcher and carried him down the hill to the 
waiting doctors. He and I flew by helicopter to Sacred Heart Hospital 
[in Spokane, Washington] where his parents were waiting for him. 
    He was just a frightened kid. His eyes looked like he was just 
going to die of fright. He, of course, hadn't wanted to shoot anybody. 
When they went out thinking they were chasing a deer they had no idea 
they were going to be shot at. He wanted me to hold his hand in the 
helicopter. I left him with his parents at the hospital and returned 
to the mountain top with Bo. I understand he's doing much better. 
    While I was gone, Bo had gotten Vicki's body out of the house and 
put her in a body bag with Randy's help. A friend of the family named 
Jackie came up at this point and began cleaning up all the blood as 
Bo walked down the hill with Vicki's body over his shoulder. 
    God bless Jackie. We thought she was going to break down--she had 
loved Vicki so much. 
    We were told by federal officials that Randy would have to come 
out of the cabin by Monday and that Bo and I would have to leave the 
mountain. Bo and I knew that meant that they were going to storm the 
house and that there would be further loss of life. 
    Sunday night Bo and I talked about our plan for Monday. We didn't 
know what we were going to do. I drafted a letter to Randy and got 
some of Randy's friends to rewrite the letter and sign it themselves. 
The letter asked Randy to come out and to p]ease fight the battle in 
the court. 
    However, we didn't know how we were going to talk Randy out. So 
we prayed in earnest for some time that night. Now Bo and I knew that 
if we were able to get back into the house we might well have to grab 
Randy and capture him and bring him out that way. Bo decided that he 
would grab Randy, pin his hands to his sides, and I would grab the 
two girls, and that way we would get them out of the house.              
    The code word for the FBI was "Alaska." If we hollered "Alaska" 
that would mean that we would need the FBI's help. The girls were 
afraid that the federal agents were going to kill them, and they had 
real good reasons to believe that.                 
    The little infant girl was still there. Bo and I were very 
concerned that eight-month-old child would be killed if the house 
were stormed. That's why we developed the "Alaska" plan. That was the 
last-ditch effort we had in mind.                           
    On Monday morning we took the letter signed by some of Randy's 
friends and shoved it under the door and let them know how Kevin was 
doing at the hospital.          
    They wouldn't open the door, but Bo and I got down and began 
praying as hard as we've ever prayed before, for nearly an hour. 
However, by 12:15 that door opened, and Randy gave up.
    We came in and hugged everybody again and prayed together. It was 
an unbelievably emotional situation. We walked down the hill hand in 
hand and presented the children to their relatives and Randy to the
marshals. 

                     It was a glorious day. -*END

                         WEAVER SET UP BY FEDS
                             By Mike Blair
                           Spotlight Magazine

    The SPOTLIGHT has learned Randy Weaver has confided to at least 
two persons he had been set up on federal firearms violations to get 
him to act as an informant for FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agents investigating the activities of right-wing groups in 
the area. 
    Weaver recently held hundreds of federal, state and local law 
enforcement at bay in his primitive mountain-top cabin in northern 
Idaho. 
    Weaver has since surrendered, only after the murders of his wife 
and his teenage son by federal agents. 
    Another man, Kevin Harris, who had been raised by the Weaver 
family since he was a teenager and who has lived with them ever 
since, is in critical condition in the Sacred Heart Medical Center in 
Spokane, Washington with a collapsed lung and bullet wounds in the 
arm after surrendering the day before Weaver led his surviving family 
members out of the cabin. 
    Weaver had been holed up in the cabin since February, 1991, after 
he failed to appear in federal court to face charges of selling an 
allegedly "sawed-off' shotgun to an undercover federal agent. His 
wife and son were murdered by federal and local law enforcement 
agents during the confrontation. 

OFFICIALS TRIED TO BLACKMAIL VETERAN

    Weaver, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, revealed in separate 
conversations with two SPOTLIGHT sources, both previously unknown to 
each other, that he was set up by federal officials who tried to 
blackmail him into infiltrating the right-wing Aryan Nations group 
and report its activities to them. 
    They intimated, he said, that if he cooperated as an informant, 
the federal officials would make a deal regarding the charges he 
faced. Weaver said he refused. 
    Prior to his arrest on the gun charges on January 17, 1991, 
Weaver had apparently attended some meetings of the Aryan Nations
White separatist group, but was not, according to a number of 
sources, a member himself. 
    He was indicted on the federal firearms violation charge by a 
grand jury in December, 1990. Although it has not been reported 
elsewhere, Weaver was apparently indicted at the time on other 
unspecified charges, which remain sealed by the court, and federal 
authorities, have not taken action on them up to this point. 
    Weaver's claim of being set up by federal officials has also been 
reported to The SPOTLIGHT by a Bonners Ferry, Idaho man. Bonners 
Ferry is near the Weaver cabin, located in Boundary County and about 
40 miles from the Canadian border. 
    The Spokane man said "Weaver told him he had some trouble while 
in the Army with an officer involving a drug investigation, but he 
(Weaver) did not think his knowledge of this was connected to his 
current problems. Weaver did not volunteer any details of the drug 
case to the man. 

LOCAL HONCHOS TAINTED  BY DOPE?

    However, the source in Spokane told The SPOTLIGHT that people 
close to Weaver have revealed to him that drug trafficking was 
involved, that Weaver may have encountered evidence of the 
involvement of local officials in illegal drug operations during 
Weaver's unsuccessful run for sheriff of Boundary County in 1988. 
    Various sources have told The SPOTLIGHT the area has for years 
been used for drug trafficking due to its remoteness and proximity to 
the Canadian border. 
    The charges for which Weaver was wanted--selling a sawed-off 
shotgun that was allegedly only a fraction of an inch below the legal 
limit to an undercover government agent, and failure to appear for a 
court hearing stemming from that charge--hardly merited the 
"take-no-prisoners" assault by law enforcement--unless, of course, 
Weaver's accusations are true. -*END

                   CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ON TRIAL IN IDAHO
                             By Andrew Arnold
                            Spotlight Magazine

     The latest developments in the police massacre of Vicki and Sam 
Weaver, and the upcoming trials of Randy Weaver and family friend 
Kevin Harris, include a fundamental test of the rule of law in this 
country.
     The trial of Randy Weaver for aiding and abetting Kevin Harris 
in the alleged murder of a federal marshal, according to lawyers in 
the West, will decide issues of paramount importance to all citizens 
of this country. 
     Weaver's daughters were mentioned in the indictment, but, 
according to a court spokesman they will not be charged with a crime. 
     Fundamental questions such as whether individuals have a right to 
protect themselves and their families from the government and what 
role an individual has in relation to the government in this society 
will be tested. 
     Gerry Spence, the flamboyant cowboy attorney, along with Kent  
Spence, the attorney's son, and Boise lawyer Charles Peterson, are  
defending Weaver. Spence said that while he does not "see eye to eye" 
with Weaver on social issues, the quest for justice burns deeper than 
politics and religion. 
     "We cheer on the cops, the power structure; and we want to give 
them this unlimited power to do whatever they want to do," Spence 
said in a prepared statement reported in the *Casper [Wyoming] Star 
Tribune.* "And we think it's all right if it's exercised against a 
White supremacist, or a nazi or a Black or a Jew, or our neighbors... 
everybody except us." 

RIGHTS IMPORTANT
     
     But by diminishing the rights of "the most vicious criminal, or a 
White separatist... what we are really doing is taking away our own 
rights," he added. "We'll wake up one day and have none... and we'll 
wonder what happened to America. 
     "We [Weaver and the lawyers] agree on the only important issue --
that in America all citizens have the right to think, to speak and to 
worship as they please," Spence said. 
     Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with assault and murder. The 
trial has been set for October 26 in the Boise, Idaho federal court. 
Peterson said in a telephone interview, prosecutors are expected to 
add more charges against the two. This would delay the trial. 
     Harris, a friend of the Weaver family, admitted shooting William  
Degan, a federal marshal, after he and two other camouflaged men were 
spotted on Weaver's mountaintop property by family dogs. The men 
killed the dogs. Then (according to Weaver's account of the story 
relayed by Spence to Radio Free America host Tom Valentine) 
14-year-old Sam Weaver and Degan were both shot and killed in a 
fire-fight. 

NO WARRANTS
     
     According to accounts of witnesses on the scene of the Idaho 
mountaintop standoff, the marshals did not have warrants nor did they 
announce they were federal agents. Peterson said this information did 
not come out at the indictment hearing. 
     Harris admitted killing Degan while he was in custody at a 
Spokane hospital, according to press accounts. 
     "Spence told this reporter that during the preliminary hearing it 
was obvious to everyone Weaver did not participate in the fire fight," 
Valentine told The SPOTLIGHT. "FBI agent [Greg] Rampton said only that  
'sometime during the exchange of fire, Randy Weaver showed up.'" 
     Rampton was not at the Weaver hearing. Two federal marshals, 
Larry Cooper and Arthur Roderick Jr., did testify, according to 
Peterson.  Neither placed Weaver at the scene of the shooting or 
definitely with a weapon. 
     "They didn't have any evidence Randy Weaver fired a shot," 
Peterson said. "Both federal marshals said they saw Weaver turn and 
run up the hill [toward his cabin]. Both testified he ran away. They 
said they thought they saw a weapon." 
     "It became very clear in the last week that there was no evidence 
that tied Randy Weaver to any misconduct," Spence said outside the 
court. "There is not one iota of evidence in this case that Mr. Weaver 
did anything." 

DEATH DETAILED 

     At Harris's separate detention hearing, Rampton testified how 
Mrs. Weaver was shot to death on August 22, according to the 
Associated Press. 
     Rampton said an unnamed agent in an FBI surveillance helicopter 
thought Harris was about to shoot at the helicopter, and the agent 
shot twice. The second shot came as Harris ran back into the cabin. It 
allegedly struck Harris in the shoulder and also hit Mrs. Weaver in 
the head, blowing off half of her face and killing her as she held her 
10-month old child in her arms.  
     The Weavers' daughters are referred to in the body of the text of 
the federal indictment, but a court spokesman said they are not 
indicted for any crimes, and the children will not stand trial. 
     The government has said it will seek the death penalty against 
both Weaver and Harris.

                             FED ALERT (?)

  Sources from the group BUSTINFO say that the Chicago suburban board,
 The Hell Pit is co-operating in a FED board bust and are keeping
 complete INFO and global trapping on ALL their callers as well as
 collecting screen captures and file lists from other Chicago area
 boards.  They can be reached at (708) 459-7267 (NOT a wise move to
 call though).

  BUSTINFO's aim is to literally paralize the board (and any other sting 
 boards) by stopping all callers to it via public information.
  Please post this alert on any other boards that can get the word out.  
 Your co-operation is essential in stopping the unfairness of
 FED board busts.

  What this means, Boys and Girls. Is that once AGAIN, Your wonderful
 GOVERNMENT is trying to gather information on the general public
 for the SOLE purpose of gathering information. I did NOT get this file
 from "The Hell PIT", which means that the GOV'T is ONCE more trying to
 STOP the free exchange of information and IDEAS.  Any and ALL info
 that "The Hell Pit" has on its users is now in the hands of Uncle Sam.
 This info includes Info on what you uploaded, what you d'loaded,any
 and all messages you sent or recieved.  PERSONALLY I don't think that
 it is ANY of the Gov'ts BUSINESS how I spend my time on ANY BBS. 

  If the GOV'T REALLY wanted to know arout BBSing and what goes on on a
 BBS, They should set up their own BBS. NOT hide behind someone elses!

 PLEASE POST THIS ON ALL BBS'S,WE DON'T NEED MORE INTERFERANCE from UNCLE SAM.

NINTENDO JOINS IN SEIZURE AGAINST ILLEGAL BULLETIN BOARD SOFTWARE 
  
     REDMOND, WA -- As part of a continuing and aggressive effort to 
halt counterfeiting of video games and business software, Nintendo of 
America Inc. and six major software manufactures filed an action 
against distributors of computer "bulletin board" network system giving 
software access to users. 
  
     Illegal software was seized by authorities from APL, an electronic 
bulletin board computer system (BBS) headquartered in Baltimore, MD. 
  
     "Counterfeiting and illegal use of video games and business 
software has grown immensely over the past few years.  We have and will 
continue to prosecute those who've become part of the underground 
counterfeiting network," said Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo's General Counsel. 
  
     The legal action outlines that illegal software was accessed 
through opperators who provide personal computers a code to enter the 
system via telephone and modem.  Illegal bulletin boards have become a 
popular trend, with an estimated 5,000 systems in the United States. 
Illegal bulletin boards also have been found in Europe and Asia. 
  
     This case represents the first time video game and business 
software companies have joind together to fight software pirating.  The 
business software companies, represented in this case through the 
Business Software Associatiom (BSA), includes Aldus, Autodesk, Lotus 
Development, Microsoft. Novel and WordPerfect.  All companies, 
including Nintendo, are individual plaintiffs in the legal action. 
  
     The action is part of Nintendo's large anti-counterfeiting 
campain, much of which is aimed at illegal video games being 
manufactured, sold and shipped from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other

     "Counterfeiting is a very serious crime and Nintendo is working 
hard to let violaters know they will be pursued and charges will be 
brought against them," added Hvalsoe.  Hvalsoe pointed to success this 
year in the signing of Federal legislation (S893) which elevates 
copyright infringement, such as that engaged in by bulletin board 
operators, to a felony with penalties upto $250,000/and up to five years

                       Edwardsville Teen Charged with theft
                       ------------------------------------
                        Belleville News Democrat 11/21/92 
        
                                (Sec. B Pg. 1)
   
 Edwardsville-A $3,500 scheme to order computer parts through the mail
with filched credit card numbers fell apart when an Edwardsville 
teen-ager overspent someone else's credit limit. Edwardsville police 
alledged Friday.
 Edwardsville High School Senior and former cheerleader Jason 
McDonald,17,of 201 S. Myrtle St. was arrested at school Friday morning
and charged by the Madison County state's attorney with felony theft,
authorities said. 
  
 His arrest followed a three-week investigation in which police 
intercepted two shipments of computer parts sent by an Ohio company 
to a fictitous name and paid for with fraudulent credit card charges,
Detective David Bradford said Friday.

 Police are looking for a third shipment-belived to include three 
computer keyboards, 20 modem and telephone facsimile cables and 
various other components-that slipped past their net,Bradford said.

 Investigators now know of four total orders involving four different
credit card numbers and are working to determine whether there are 
more,he said.
     
 McDonald's older brother,Christopher McDonald,was stabbed to death
in Feburary 1988 in a high profile murder case that led to a 15-year 
prison sentance for a former classmate.Jason McDonald was at home with
his brother ,then an 18-year old honor student,when Christopher was
stabbed by Alec MacDonald,now 22.

 McDonald's father,Gary McDonald,lost a bid Nov. 3 for a Madison
County Board seat. He also campaigned briefly for county sheriff 
in 1990.

 Bradford said the computer scam began to unravel early this month
when a credit card company informed an Edwardsville man that an order
to Midwest MicroPeripherals of Fletcher,Ohio,had exceeded his credit 
limit.
 The credit card owner said,"No,not me," Bradford said.
     
 McDonald was in Madison County Jail in Edwardsville on Friday in   
lieu of $30,000 bail set by Circuit Court Judge Charles V. Romani Jr. 
Unless he is deemed eligible for the county's pretrial release 
program,
 McDonald will have to post $3,000 cash or $60,000 in property to go 
free until his trial.
