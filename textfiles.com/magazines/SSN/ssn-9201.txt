         This is the premier issue of Sub Space News. I hope you  like
         it.  Later;  I  hope  to have more Trekkers to take an active
         part in SSN by posting trivia, Star  Trek  Parodies,  general
         rumors, and etc.

         This will not be the nicest looking Fan Club publication, and
         the grammar will not be perfect. But; the strong suit will be
         Trek related information.

         I  had  better tell you something about myself.

         I  have been a fan of Star Trek since 1967 when I watched the
         episode "Arena" with an older cousin.

         I  am  very active on the BBS networks.  Especially so in the
         Star  Trek  conferences.   In  fact;  I  read  6  Star   Trek
         conferences on a daily basis, and moderate three of them.

         Intelec (Conference Host)
         Smart Net (Conference Host)
         Lite Link (Conference Host)
         U'NI Net
         Ilink
         RIME

         If you have access to one of the Star Trek conferences listed
         above, drop a note to Bill Lambdin, and say hi. I would  love
         to hear your comments.

     This essay is the author's compilaton and interpretation of
the various sources available on the theory and evolution of warp
travel as presented in Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next
Generation by Gene Roddenberry and the various Star Trek authors
and writers.
     Almost all sources have been considered (except most fan
created stuff which I don't have access to), and a compromise is
arrived at to reconcile most differences.  When there are
conflicts among the sources, the TNG Technical Manual is chosen
to be the undisputed source, due to the fact that it is the only
manual done by people who actually work on the show.

     There will be periodic updates as new information came to
light, so stay tuned.
     Enough of the legal jargon...  Let's get to the story.


PRE-WARP

     Before warp engines, there was impulse engines.
     Impulse engines are what enabled the first scouts to reach
Alpha Centauri from Terra.  They are based on the Newtonian
action-reaction principle.  The energy obtained from the fusion
reactors is used to convert deuterium to plasma, and eject the
plasma via forcefields.  The impulse engines also act as power
generators for the ship.
     Obviously the acceleration is rather slow and maximum speed
is definitely nowhere near speed of light.  After long periods of
acceleration high impulse speeds approaching speed of light can







         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 6




be achieved.  However, due to relativistic time dilations, high
impulse speeds are not used except in emergencies.  Normal
impulse operations are limited to a velocity of 0.25c. (1)
     One of the new ships equipped with impulse engines, the SS
VALIANT galactic survey cruiser, went through a wormhole and
encountered the edge of the galaxy.  It did not return in the
process. (2)


EARLY WARP

     Zefram Cochrane was credited with the discovery of the
principles of "warp drive".  In short, single shaped fields,
created at tremendous energy expenditure, could distort the
space/time continuum enough to drive a starship.  (3)
     The earliest Continuum Distortion Propulsion (CDP) Drive, or
what became the warp drive, was completed by the Cochrane team in
2061, which they named the "fluctuation superimpeller."  It is a
fusion power source coupled to a subspace distortion generator
coil.  Unmanned tests showed the device allows the probe to
travel at light speed without being subjected to the limits of
relativity.
     What the drive did is to create a portal between Einsteinian
space and "subspace".  The portal is unstable due to lack of
sufficient power.  However, the probe is able to move into the
portal and stay within for Planck time (1.3x10^-43 sec), and stay
in this universe for Planck time as well.  The probe then
fluctuates back and forth, as the subspace distortion exerts an
overall force on it.  The net effect is the probe travelled at
lightspeed without spending the infinite energy as being
predicted by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.
     The CDP engines are soon fitted to all ships.  The Cochrane
team moved to Alpha Centauri later on a CDP-powered ship, where
they continued their research.  The trip took "only four years"
due to the CDP drive.
     The space and subspace distortion is measured in Cochranes,
in memory of Zefram Cochrane, who disappeared one day when he is
about 80 years old. (4)


IMPROVING WARP

     As the CDP drive distorts space but could not maintain it,
research is underway to cut down the power:volume ratio in order
to generate more power in order to maintain a stable portal.
There were no suitable answer for sufficient power density until
the answer was found: anti-matter.
     Research have long found that matter-antimatter annihilation
produces the most power.  However, the potential danger is so
great that the research in the area is quite slow until
artificial gravity is mastered, and the anti-matter can be safely
contained and controlled.









         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 7




     The reaction between matter and antimatter produced clean
photons, which is captured and used to generate the subspace
field via drive coil(s).  It was measured that the CDP engine
uses approximately 5x10^4 megajoules to travel at lightspeed.
Anti-Matter can provide ten to one hundred times the power in the
same volume.
     Theorists argued over what would happen once the continuum
distortion field could be maintained.  Most agreed that the power
usage will drop when the field is established.  However, no one
knows what will happen after that, or how they will use it.
     The probe using anti-matter power was readied and sent.  It
sent back surprising news:  once lightspeed is breached, the
power use drops back down to approximately 2x10^2 Mj.  Attempt to
increase subspace distortion beyond the point created an
approximately cubic relationship between power applied and
subspace distortion amount, which in turn affected apparent
speed.  The probe at one time exceeded 30c, which is a record.
The power consumed at that time is approximately 3.1 times the
amount used at light speed.
     Later studies shows that the probe generated subspace fields
(later warp fields).  The field is assymetrical, and exerts force
in some directions.  The probe is moved by the counterforce.
     To measure the supralight speed, the new unit called "time
warp factor" is invented.  It is named for the time-space
distortions created by the drive. (5)  Based on the empirical
relationship established during the probe run, the Cochrane team
decided to start a scale with lightspeed as the reference point.
Based on the proportionality between power consumed and apparent
speed, they derived a simple formula, S = W^3 c, where S = speed
in multiples of c, and W is the "time warp factor".  Later,
"time" is dropped for simplicity, and the factors simply became
known as "warp factor", or more simply "warp".
     The subspace field that is maintainable became known as the
now familiar "warp field".  Measured in Cochranes, the its definition
is amount of subspace distortion at warp 1, or lightspeed.
     The cigar-shaped probe originally virated heavily during
entry into warp space.  Study of its telemetry lead to
experiments with several designs.  Finally, upon chance, it was
discovered that a saucer-shaped hull helps facilitate entry into
subspace.  Later ships are mostly designed with a saucer-shaped
primary hull.
     The first Federation warp-equipped ship is BONAVENTURE,
which disappeared years later on an exploratory mission.  (6)
     Improvements are soon added.  Instead of a single coil,
multiple coils are used to generate multiple fields.  Each field
is projected from the ship, which pushes upon each other only in
certain directions.  The ship then moves in the opposite direction.
     By varying the frequency of the field generation and the field's
direction, speed and direction of the ship can be controlled.
On the other hand, by having multiple coils, and varying the frequency
the coils are energized, different amount of acceleration can be
achieved.  GALAXY-class starships can go from 0 to warp 9 in less
than a second at top acceleration.








         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 8




     However, there are limitations.  One, due to manufacturing
technologies, subspace coils can only go up to a certain size,
which puts a limit on the size of the field possible, and
therefore the size of the ship carrying it.  Two, the higher the
speed, the higher subspace compression becomes.  That means more
power must be consumed to generate the same subspace fields at
higher velocities.
     The anti-matter powered ships have a maximum speed of
approximately warp 4, or 256c, due to lack of power.  The warp 4
limit became know as the first warp barrier, since researchers
predicted that unless a breakthrough is found, there is no way a
ship can fit the engine needed to break the warp 4 barrier due to
limits on energy density.
     A second problem that arises is in order to make sure all
matter reacted with antimatter, only minuscule amounts of each
are injected into the reaction chamber in order to keep the
reaction under control.  This slow rate of injection limits the
top speed and acceleration of the ship.

presented in ST:TNG Tech Manual, with some historical references
and my own conjectures thrown in)


SUBSPACE RADIO

     Once we can travel, we need to communicate.  Subspace radio
is then invented, since if we can send matter beyond speed of
light, why not energy?
     Subspace radio is based on this principle.  Energy with
encoded information is sent into warp/sub-space.  Its propagation
speed and distance depends on how "deep" it went into the warp
space, which depends on how much power is applied and how focused
and polarized it is when beamed.
     Early Subspace radios went up to warp (8), which is quite a
bit faster than most ships at that time.  Later, the speed is
regularly upgraded as more efficient means of transmission are
found, driving the energy "harder" and "deeper" into subspace,
thus achieving greater warp factors.
     However, there is a problem with the subspace radio
propagation distance.  No matter how focused the signal is, the
signal will eventually "float" out of warp space, and drop back
into normal space as regular EM waves.  For this reason, there
are regular subspace booster beacons in a network around the
Federation and beyond to retransmit the subspace radio waves that
are almost out of energy or already out of energy.

DILITHIUM

     Dilithium is the most useful material to a starship due to
its ability to regulate antimatter flow.  In a way, it acts as a
sponge to anti-matter when subjected to a high-energy field.  It
will not react (maybe react very minutely) with anti-matter itself.
     If matter is injected into the crystal with equal amount of
anti-matter (from opposite sides, of course), the result is
almost perfectly tuned plasma, yielding much higher energy
efficiency than pure matter-antimatter reaction without dilithium.
     Previously, in order to ensure the matter-antimatter
reaction do not leave any residue, only minuscule amounts are
injected at a time.  Now, with dilithium, larger engines could be
built since total reaction between matter and antimatter can be
virtually assured.
     Early ships with dilithium crystal equipped warp engines
needs to replace the crystals frequently since the crystals
decrystallize after certain amount of usage.  (7)  It was not
totally understood why this would occur other than the simple
explanation of "aging".
     Later on, it was found that imperfections in the crystal
traped antimatter atoms, which then reacted with the crystal
itself, causing the molecular chain of the crystal to fall apart
over time.  However, scientists are puzzled since if that is the
case, the crystal decay rate would be thousands of times faster
than the actual rate.
     A theoretical explanation was offered much later, that high
energy photons, when absorbed by dilithium, rebuilds the
molecular chains.  The matter-antimatter reaction produced
photons, which means the crystal is self-repairing, up to a
point, beyond which it starts to disintegrate. (8)
     So theoretically it is possible to regenerate a dilithium
crystal.  However, it was found that it is much more practical to
mine dilithium that the idea was not tested or put to use until
much later.
     In TNG's time, dilithium crystals are synthesized so
imperfections are virtually nil, and reactions efficiencies are
approaching theoretical maximum.
     Dilithium provided the necesary breakthrough to leap beyond
the first warp barrier.  Sufficient power is now available to
power warp engines to deal with high power expenditures needed to
surpass the power peak found at warp factor 4, and beyond.
     Later improvements brought about at the time of ST:TMP
brought the theoretical maximum speed to warp 12, or 1728c.
Although this speed limit has been broken, those are under
extraordinary circumstances and cannot be repeated.
     After further research, it was found that speed increase
beyond warp 11 requires exponential increase in power
consumption.  There seems to be no end in sight.

TRANSWARP

     No information available, as the subject is still classfied.
Several conjectures are available though.
     It is believed that the term "transwarp" is short for
"trancendental warp".  While the term could mean above all warp
before it, the term also has a second meaning: above and beyond
the material universe.
     What we do know is that the implementation in EXCELSIOR was "an
abysmal failure".  The failure itself was classified, but it was
mentioned that EXCELSIOR was later converted back to use normal warp
drive instead of transwarp.
     We shall leave the rest to your imagination.


REDEFINING WARP

     For many decades, scientists have demanded a revision of the
warp factor scale.  The early scale was based on incomplete
information.  The power consumption ratio does not follow the
cubed formula at warp factors greater than 4, and falls entirely
out of proportion when approaching warp 11 and beyond.
     Vulcan Academy of Science, after decades of studying warp
factors and related power consumption, found a series of
repeating peaks and bottoms.  At certain intervals along the
power consumption curve, there are vertical drops, then
geometrical increases of power usage vs velocity.
     A revised scale used these regular peaks and valleys to be
the basepoints for the warp factors.  There are nine valleys
between warp 0.9 and warp 10, and at warp 10 the speed is
infinite.  Please see TNG Tech Manual's chart.

Here's a conversion chart for those who do not have the TNG Tech
Manual handy:

NEXT GENERATION WARP DRIVE

     Other than greater efficiency and better intermix control,
there are no breakthrough technologies in The Next Generation,
nor are any expected.
     Top speed in TNG is warp 9.99, and a starship can only maintain
this speed for minutes.  Anti-matter consumption is so great in this
case that the cooling system cannot cope with the task for too long.
Further usage risk coolant leak and runaway catastrophic reactions.
     On the other hand, acceleration have been much improved in the 24th
Century.  By employing multiple coils, each coil generating its own
field, a larger amount of subspace distortion can be generated at once,
and larger acceleration is achieved.  GALAXY-class starship can
accelerate from standstill to warp 6 in less than a second.


LOOKING BEYOND

     We will just say that the following are under consideration
or further research:

**   A "shunt" drive, almost instantaneous transport from point A
to point B, similar to wormhole but controlled
(TNG: To The Nth Degree)

**   Psi-assisted warp drive, as demonstrated by the "Traveller",
with speeds up to warp 9.9999999996
(TNG: Where None Have Gone Before)

     Could Transwarp be one of the above?
     It was speculated that the ENTERPRISE of the year 3000 will
by using the "shunt" drive as previously shown in TNG:The Nth Degree.
Indeed, who will know for sure?

                                  TREK HUMOR

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the ship
Not a circuit was buzzing, not one microchip;
The phasers were hung in the arm'ry securely,
In hope that no aliens would get up that early.

The crewmen were nestled all snug in their bunks
(Except for the few who were partying drunks);
And Picard in his nightshirt and Bev in her lace,
Had just settled down for a neat face-to-face...

When out in the halls there arose such a racket,
That we leapt from our beds, pulling on pants and jacket.
Away to the lifts we all shot like a gun,
Leapt into the cars and yelled loudly, "Deck One!".

The bridge Red-Alert lights, which flashed through the din,
Gave a luster of Hades to objects within.
When, what, on the viewscreen, shold our eyes behold,
But a weird kind of sleigh, and some geek who looked old.
But the glint in his eyes was so strange and askew,
That we knew in a moment it had to be Q.

His sleigh grew much larger as closer he came.
Then he zapped on the bridge and addressed us by name;
"It's Riker! It's Data! It's Worf and Jean-Luc!
It's Geordi! And Wesley, the genetic fluke!
To the top of the bridge, to the top of the hall!
Now float away, float away, float away all!

As leaves in autum are whisked off the street,
So the floor of the bridge came away from our feet,
And up to the ceiling our bodies they flew,
As the captian called out, "What the hell is this Q?!".
The prankster just laughed and expanded his grin,
And, snapping his fingers, he vanished again.

As we took in our plight and were looking around,
The spell was removed, and we crashed to the ground.
Then Q, dressed in fur from his head to his toe,
Appeared once again to continue the show.
"That's enough!" cried the captian, "You'll stop this at once!",
And Riker said, "Worf! Take your aim at this dunce!",
"I'm deeply offended, Jean-Luc," replied Q.
"I just wanted to spend Christmas with you."

As we scoffed at his words, he produced a large sack.
He dumped out the contents, and took a step back.
"I've brought gifts," he said, "just to show I'm sincere.









         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 13




There's something delightful for everyone here."
He sat on the floor and dug into the pile,
And handed out gifts with his most charming smile.

"For Counselor Troi, there's no need to explain,
Here's Tylenol-Beta for all of your pain.
For Worf I've got mints as his breath's not too great,
And for Geordi LaForge, an inflatable date.
For Wesley, some hormones, and Clearasil-Plus;
For Data, a joke book; for Riker, a truss.
For Beverly Crusher, there's sleek lingerie,
And for Jean-Luc, the thrill of seeing her that way."

Then he sprang to his feet with that grin on his face,
And, clapping his hands, disappeared into space.
But we heard him exclaim as he dwindled form sight,
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good flight!!"

                <Star Trek : The Next Generation Style>

                <the following text is by Anthony Moses>

During a recent routine uplink to a communications satellite while
attempting to call an Alaskan BBS, I happened to intercept the following
mail packet.  According to a physicist friend of mine at the university,
unprecedented solar flare activity on that date may have resulted in a
transient chronophase (or time-shift) in the subspace frequencies, with
the result that I have, astounding as it may seem, apparently downlaoded
seasonal E-mail from the crew of the USS Enterprise 1701-D.  These
holiday greetings are reproduced here as received (with editorial
comment by myself), and with no guarantee of their authenticity (or
quality).

 FROM JEAN-LUC PICARD (to the tune of "Let It Snow"):

 Oh, the vacuum outside is endless,
 Unforgiving, cold, and friendless,
 But still we must boldly go--
 Make it so, make it so, make it so!



















         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 14




 FROM WILLIAM RIKER (to the tune of "Deck the Halls"):

 Here's a vexing Christmas riddle:
 (Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la la)
 Why must I play second fiddle?
 (Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la la)
 How can I impress Deanna
 (Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la la la)
 When I'm number two banana?
 (Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la la)

 FROM WESLEY CRUSHER, Starfleet Cadet
(to the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"):

 I'm at Starfleet Academy,
 And I'd just like to say
 I miss the opportunity
 To weekly save the day--
 To make things worse, I have to be
 In some dumb Christmas play!
 Yes, I'm bright, though I'm just a teenaged boy,
 Only a boy,
 And the Enterprise was my most favorite toy!

 FROM DATA:

 Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
 Jingle all the way!
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh--
 or so I am reliably informed; lacking a subjective
 and intuitively perceived referent for the term "fun,"
 I am able only to report the phenomenon as experienced
 by others, whose individual perceptions somewhat color the--
 yes, sir.

 WORF E-MAILED two different greetings.
 The first appears to be to the tune of "White Christmas":

 I'm dreaming of a dead Pakled,
 Just like the one in Rec Deck Eight.
 They all think they've hidden,
 But this one didn't,
 And I'm using him as bait.
 I'm dreaming of a dead Pakled--
 Their mental skills are rather lame.
 May your foes die sonless, in shame--
 And I hope you're wishing me the same!













         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 15




 The second is most easily sung to the tune of "The Christmas Song"
 ("Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire"):

 Phasers flashing in the depths of space,
 Ripping up an airtight hull;
 Signs of fear on your enemy's face,
 And life-support signs reading null!
 Ev'rybody knows a Romulan's a spineless foe
 Who lacks the Klingon will to fight!
 Phaser beams set his torso aglow--
 He'll find it hard to breathe tonight!
 He knows that Worf is on his way!
 And soon he'll be the object of the verb "to slay"!
 And ev'ry slinking Rom and Pakled spy
 Will soon become the subject of the verb "to die"!
 And so I'm offering this simple threat
 To Roms, and all Ferengi, too:
 You'll be as dead as a life-form can get--
 Merry Christmas to you!

Evidence suggests that these last two greetings are samples from a
proposed anthology entitled "Klingon Kristmas Karols," published by the
Federation as an attempt to translate certain aspects of Terran culture
into Klingon terms; further examples from this festive book of holiday
glee would be (to coin a term) fascinating to contemplate.  The reader
will note that Christmas felicitations from Deanna Troi, Beverly
Crusher, Geordi LaForge, Guinan, and M.E.  O'Brien are curiously absent;
perhaps some other user has intercepted these, and will post them for
our continued edification.

Editor's Note:  As our story begins (?), the Borg have returned to the
Enterprise, and are serving up music for the wedding of Data and the
Ship's Computer, arranged in a hallucinatory frenzy by Data under the
influence of Kieko's Kung Pao chicken (MSG acts like LSD in androids).

                                 PROLOGUE
                          ***********************


   Resplendent in his polyester tuxedo, Data entered Ten Forward and strode
down the makeshift aisle, as his bride-to-be was wheeled in by four grim-
faced engineering ensigns.
   The computer access terminal was a vision of loveliness in white peau de
soie and lace.  Data approached it, light-footed.
   "You do look lovely, my dear," he breathed.
   Amid mutterings of "matrimony is irrelevent," the Borg struck up "Here
Comes The Bride".
   In formal dress, Jean-Luc Picard approached the happy couple.  This is
the most absurd farce I've ever witnessed, he thought, but kept his private
musings to himself and prepared to direct the vows.
   "Do you, Data..."
   Data interrupted with a hiccup, and then another.  The MSG was wearing
off!  He glanced regretfully at the ferrous bride.  Picard wished he were
elsewhere.
   "It would not work out," Data remarked blithely.  "Our ports and plugs
are incompatible.  I am serial, while you are parallel.  I am DC, while you
are AC. I..."  He was unable to finish his apology because at that moment,
the access terminal began sobbing and quickly shorted herself out.

   The bridesmaids (all confirmed and hopeless DSBSG's) quickly saw their
chance and surrounded the groom, determined to get rid of those blasted
yellow contacts once and for all and see what color his eyes REALLY are.
   The Enterprise continued careening off into the depths of space out of
control.  Someone, somewhere, wailed pitifully:
   "Where is Wesley Crusher??"



                          ***********************
                        THE PART AFTER THE PROLOGUE
                          ***********************


   Meanwhile, the jaded and rejected Geordi LaForge sulked in the enginnering
lab, plenty pissed that even the robot got a fiance.
   Data, reeling from the electronic signals pressed into his skin by the
Borg and bridesmaids, stumbled into the lab just in time to see Geordi
ready to leave this happy world via a cable attached to the warp engine.
   Data knocked into him and got the cable shoved up his nose.  The energy
boost from the nasal link caused sparks to fly out of his ears and smoke to
rise from the thin cracks where his scalp patches met.  He turned, smiled
lecherously at Geordi, and gurgled, "What's a blind babe like you doing in
a place like this?"
   Geordi's hair stood on end.  He frowned in dire anticipation of what Data
was grinning about, and started to run as fast as he could, sprinting into
the turbolift, just in time to avoid the randy robot.  He turned around and
was surprised to see the chief medical officer standing in the corner with
the captain.
   Damn!, thought Beverly.  Just when I was about to tell Jean Luc what
I've been trying to tell him for the past 4 seasons!
   When the turbolift arrived at its destination, Geordi exited and escaped
into Ten Forward, where he found Guinan busy cleaning up the mess made from
the aborted wedding.  Sweeping bridesmades & Borg into an untidy heap,
Guinan turned toward Geordi to ask what was wrong, but accidentally knocked
him unconscious with the brim of her hat.  Geordi plopped into the pile of
discarded wedding guests.
   Guinan sighed and turned to look at the unconscious Geordi.  His VISOR had
flown into the Borg pile when he fell, ending up somewhere in the hopeless
tangle of cords and metal.
   She stared at Geordi for a moment, then frowned, thinking of her
ex-husband, Q!  Oh, yes, she better not let anyone ever hear about that
mess, or she'd be the laughing stock of the ship.  Now, why didn't she pick
something a little less arrogant, a little less powerful, something like
this Geordi?  She wandered over to the pile.

   Meanwhile, in search of the object of his desires, Data bumped into a
cleaning droid, busily vacuuming up the remains of the Conga line.  Data
heard the strains of an obscure ages-old earth ditty as he gazes into the
video receptors of the droid. Figuring if he can't be with the one he
loves, he will love the one he's with.  Sweeping the droid into a nearby
broom closet, he whispered, "Did anyone ever tell you how lovely you are
when the red alert beacon shines off your chrome outer covering?"
   The droid, beeping and blooping, began tingling all over, and started to
overheat. <insert commercial break>


                          ***********************


   Riker, finally becoming somewhat lucid after being clobbered by Data and
Deanna, limped down the corridor, concerned about his ship and not half
hopeful that he'd find Troi.
   Suddenly, he saw and smelled smoke from further down the corridor.
Limping faster, Riker found the source of the smoke emanating from the
broom closet.  He pushed the contact, and out fell a totally dissassembled
cleaning droid and a maniacal looking lieutenant commander.
   Data looked at him with delight. "Ah!  Commander!  Intriguing!  I am
feeling more fully functional than ever!" he yipped, and leaped out at his
superior officer.
   Startled and remebering the bashing he just had at the robot's
hands, Riker made a short sqeaking noise and backed into a laundry shaft
he didn't know about.
   He felllllllllllll...........landing with a THUD on top of the pile of
dirty laundry.  OUCH!!
   "Ouch?" thinks Riker.  "Why did I say ouch?  I'm not hurt and my 2 x 4
is still in place."
   Feeling a movement beneath him, Riker dug down into the dirty pile to
find who or what was lurking there.  He pulled out the squirming form of
   "Wesley! Is THIS where you've been the last year?"
   Wesley looked up at him and yelled, "Geezus!  I've been down here
yelling for someone to notice me since stardate... uh... well, a long time!
Commander!  Wha..hey, what happened to your face?"
   "Oh, Wesley, shi-  you wouldn't believe it.  Data and Deanna beat me to
shreds because Tasha... well, you've got a lot to catch up on.  Tasha is
alive, though!  ALIVE!"
   "Is she still..."
   "Stacked?  Oh, yes..."
   They sat for a moment in quiet reverence.
   Wesley finally turned and bit his lip (like he does) and said, "We need
to get out of here, Commander.  I'm too puny and spindly to bust this grate
open; I haven't eaten anything in a year or so.  But *you*..."
    Riker stood precariously on the pile of clothing, gave a manly smirk,
adjusted his shirt and walloped the grate with a spinning kick.
   "Ooof!" he bellowed, and fell back into the laundry; but the grate had
been bent open, and so he and Wesley bent it further back and crawl out.

   They found themselves deep in the body of the ship, damn near the bottom
hull.  The grate opened to a service corridor.  Looking around, Riker
noticed that there were no comm panels nearby, and no personnel.  Well, at
least here I can gather my thoughts for a while, decide on a plan, Riker
thought.
   Thank god he doesn't have a thing for teenaged boys, Wesley thought.

   Keiko O'Brien, drunk on Saurian brandy and pissed off at her two-timing
husband, lurched over to her special voice-print locked drawer, opened it
and retrived her family heirloom: an ancient samurai sword.  With the
stealth of a ninja, she stole out into the corridor.

   In Ten Forward, one Borg, still stunned by the jazz rhythms, grabbed
the VISOR and places it over its eyes.  Mesmerized by all the pretty
colors, it shorted out, thereby destroying the entire Borg pile.
   Well, thought Guinan, that's one less mess I'll have to clean up.  She
picked up the VISOR, stroking it lovingly.  Yes, she thought, someone like
Geordi could make me forget all about that insufferable Q.
   Suddenly there was a blaze of white light.  Guinan turned to see her
ex-squeeze standing before her, dressed in a Star Fleet Admiral's uniform.
"You again," hissed the Hostess.  "You really must do something about your
wardrobe!"
   "Guinan, dear!  Is that any way to greet me?  You WERE thinking of me,
you know. So here I am in all my magnificence!"
   "MagNIficence?  Oh PLEASE.  You have the worst timing. I just got through
cleaning up the mechanical conga line and knocking out the chief engineer,
and honey, I don't need you showing up right now." Guinan shook her head
mournfully, and waved a warning finger at him, which he dodged.  "You know,
you colossal bastard, the last time we were together, I told you you'd
better not cross my path again.  I think you just made a big mistake.  Now,
I've put up with you visiting Picard, but to think of popping in on *me* -"
   Q laughed. "Don't give me your idle threats, Guinan dear - I KNOW you
have a pretty mean gonad-disruptor-ray hidden in that hand, but I haven't
spent eternity without a few tricks of my own, even for *you*!"  Q snapped
his fingers, and in a bright flash of light Guinan transformed into an
exact likeness of Tasha Yar!
   "Damn you Q, turn me back!" Guinan shrieked.  Q smiled/glared at her.
"Oh no.  I think this situation warrants you remaining just the way you
are.  Now, I'm going to go pop in on an old friend of mine."


                          ***********************

   Q found the one he was looking for in an unlikely setting.  Data was
still in the broom closet, futilely trying to repair the object of his
desires.  Q took one look at the burnt-out cleaning droid and Data's
enamored expression and put two and two together.
   "Q!" said Data, "Why are you here?"
   "Why ask why?" chastized Q.  "It looks like I arrived too late to save
you from such a sorry state.  For shame!  And to think you would settle for
a glorified vacuum cleaner when I have such a nice present waiting for you
in Ten Forward!"
   "Present?  Oooooooo...I love presents!" croaked Data.  And off he
stumbled in search of his surprise.


                          ***********************


   Back in 10 Forward, Guinan was still trying to figure out how she was
going to get out of this latest mess Q had so generously created for her.
She cautiously looked in the mirror.  Instead of seeing her own familiar
face, the visage that stared back at her was a woman who could not act her
way out of a paper bag.  "I'll never get used to THIS!" wailed Guinan.  Her
hat was so frightened by the prospect of being worn by a blonde floozey
that it flew off Guinan's head and burrowed deep into the pile of wedding
guests, muttering something about wanting its Mommie.
   Just when Guinan thought things couldn't get any worse, in walked Data.
In an instant, his fried former flame was forgotten.
   "Tasha!  Baby!  Come to Papa!" leered Data as he approached Gui-Yar with
outstretched arms and twinkling eyes.
   "No...Data...you have me confused with someone else," stuttered Gui-Yar
as she backed up toward the bar.  Not wishing to play footsie with an
amorous android, Gui-Yar furiously tried to come up with an idea (before
Data came up with...never mind).  I can transform back into myself if I
just have something to focus my energies on! she thought.  Scrambling, her
hands found the phaser rifle she kept hidden behind the bar.  Quickly
thumbing the switch to setting 13 1/2, she fired!  Data's eyes grew wide as
he saw his beloved Tasha disappear in an explosion of sparks.  Gui- Yar was
gone.  But in her place stood another woman with a strange hairdo and a
hideously stiff uniform that hid her shapely form. She had become...
RomuYar!
   Sparks flew from Data's earholes. "B-b-b-b-b-ay-bee!" he moaned
mournfully.  "What hap-p-p-e-nnn-ed to You? You look dreadful in that
getup!"
   Before the mystery woman could reply, Geordi bleated "Help me!" from the
pile of dead Borgs.  Data turned and studied the pile one brief moment,
then helped his friend out of the tangle.
   "Who's that?  Wha- is that you, Data?  Oh no...."
   "Do not be alarmed, Geordi" Data replied. "I am no longer interested in
you as a potential mate.  Where is your VISOR?"
   "I don't know," Geordi said.
   "I think it's in this -"

   Just then a shaft of phaser beam pierced the light control panel,
darkening the room so that only the glow of the stars outside remained.
Startled as a machine gets, Data picked up Geordi and flung him over his
shoulder, and dashed out of 10 Forward, too concerned with protecting his
friend to remember to question the strange woman who so resembled his Tasha.


                          ***********************


   Riker leaned up against the wall of the corridor.  He had managed to
ascertain that ship was not being captained because Picard would not answer
his communicator call.  For that matter, neither would anyone else.  Wesley,
though not knowing what was wrong, was already babbling about a technological
solution.
   "Commander, if I attach a warp coil degeneration unit with an overhead cam
and daisy wheel braking system, and insert a specially programmed virus into
the ROM of the computer core, along with hooking up a special project I had
in my lab when I disappeared and which by lucky coincidence just may be the
thing we need, I think I can save the ship and increase gas mileage by twelve
percent.  And Commander, listen to this..."
   "Shut up, Wesley," Riker growled.  "I am so sick and tired of you always
popping up with some gadget to save the ship."  He turned to face his
companion.  "You know, I worked hard to get where I am.  Damned hard.  I
never asked for favors, like you do.  I never brownnosed or kissed butt like
you do.  I never did the Captain's laundry like you do.  I really don't mind
when you have valid suggestions, but I wish you would for once let me think
of some of my own solutions.  You think that manipulating the hardware on
this ship is all that'll ever save it.  I don't see things that way.  And
Wes...get a real haircut, willya?"
   Wes bit his lip (like he does) and tears rolled down his cheeks. "Gosh,
Commander," he wimpered, "I was only trying to help."
   "Yeah, well, help by thinking about this, kid: how do we find out what's
happening without getting killed or kissed, and how do we get control of
this ship?"
   "Yes sir," Wes replied, looking chipper.  "And Commander...I won't let you
down."
   When has he ever, the little brat, Riker thought.


                          ***********************


   Data raced down the corridor toward the turbolift.  "Engineering," said
the android as he gently placed the still-groggy Geordi on the floor.
   "Engineering?" replied the turbolift voice.  "Why would you want to go
there?  Why not the holodeck?  We could have a lot of fun and..."
   "What the hell is wrong now?" exclaimed Geordi.
   "The computer was in a somewhat...unusual state when I last saw it,"
admitted Data.
   "Take us to Engineering," Data ordered the turbolift.  "Now!  That is an
order."









         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 22




   "Well, if you're going to be that way about it..," whined the Voice.
   "What good will I be to you in Engineering, when I can't see a thing!"
complained the engineer.  "My VISOR is still in Ten Forward, remember?"
   "We can construct a temporary replacement there, Geordi," said Data.
   "Yeah," Geordi sighed.  "I keep forgetting you can build anything."


                          ***********************


   Wesley was still sniffling (yet another thing he does better than any-
one).
   "Oh, wipe your nose, kid," grumbled Riker.  "It looks like our best bet
is to head toward engineering where you can construct your super-duper fix
of the week."
   Wesley dabbed his nose with something he pulled out of his pocket.
   "Where the hell -" snapped Riker as he saw the piece of cloth.  "What
are you doing with Deanna's bra?"
   "Commander," wailed an embarrased Wesley, "How do you think I passed
the time that whole year I was trapped in the laundry room?  Besides...how
did you know it was Counselor Troi's?"
   "Never mind, kid," said Riker, clearing his throat.  "Just keep moving."


                          ***********************


   In the ready room, Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher were in the middle of
heavy breathing exercises (very good for the pulmonary system, dontcha know).
   Beverly cooed, "Oh, Jean Luc.  I thought you'd never..."
   "After all, Bev," said the captain.  "I couldn't have you falling for
nothing but invertebrates every week.  It's time you had a real man."
   Just as the couple was about to do something everyone has wanted them to
do for four years, the red alert klaxon sounded.  "Noooooo!!!!" wailed
Bev.  "Not NOW!!!"
   "Calm yourself, Beverly," said Jean Luc soothingly.  "You know the ship
has to come first."  The couple, straightening their uniforms, strode into
the bridge.  "What the hell is going on, Ensign?  Where are the rest of the
bridge officers?"
   "I don't know, Sir!" said Ensign Bimbo-of-the-Week.  "No one will answer
their hails.  And the computer refuses to help find them!"
   "Merde!" spat the Captain.  "I can't leave the bridge for 5 minutes...
Computer!  Locate Commander Riker and Lieutenant Commander Data this
instant!" he barked, tugging on his uniform.  This powerful gesture
miraculously restored the computer to full working order.
   "Lieutenant Commander Data is in Turbolift Four, heading toward Engin-
eering with Lieutenant Commander La Forge," said the computer. "Commander
Riker and Ensign Wesley Crusher are in access crawlway twelve, same heading."
   "Wesley!" cried Bev.  "Damn!  Just when I thought he was out of my hair!"


                          ***********************









         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 23




   The turbolift sped towards its destination in perfect working order, for
a change.  Geordi leaned back against the wall and wished Data would make
more noise to reassure him that he wasn't alone.  If Data wasn't talking he
would often not bother to "breathe" either.  Geordi imagined putting a bell
around Data's neck, when the whoosh of the turbolift ceased and he heard the
doors open, then Data's solid arm guiding him forward.
   "Come on, Geordi, we are here," he prompted and shoved Geordi forward into
an Engineering work panel.  Geordi's head racked across several of the touch-
sensitive panels and landed on one in particular with a loud "crack".
   "Self-Destruct sequence initiated!" the computer moaned suavely.
"Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc.  Recognize Riker, William T.  Recognize that
sexy Data.  Recognize La Forge, Geordi.  Recognize ice cream bazooka.
Recognizzzblurp--" and the panel sizzled blue and smoked.
   Data stood in the blue glow and said, "I believe 'Oh shit' is the proper
expletive in these circumstances."
   "Wouldn't you rather interface with me?" the computer pleaded.


                          ***********************


   "Look, Commander!" Wes yelped, pointing to a red alert light. "Red
Alert!"
   Riker rolled his eyes.  "No kidding, pimple-head!" he muttered.  Riker
wiped his brow with the back of his hand, and shook his head. "I'm sorry,
Wes" he said. "It's been a horrible day.  Female trouble included."
   Out of nowhere, the computer blurted, "Don't play coy with me, honey-
bunch."
   Riker thought, "At least we're almost to engineering.  I think it's just a
little more.  I've got to believe that.  We'll save the ship and be happy and
politically correct again."


                          ***********************


   Keiko returned to her quarters with a carton of two dozen glass jars and
a container of formaldehyde.  Once she finished her task, she would keep of
the trophies safe where no one would bother them.  An ancient method of
preservation that they would deserve.
   She stood in front of her mirror, brandishing the sword masterfully.
Turning, she swiftly sliced a patch out of a Starfleet transporter chief's
uniform which had been left on the floor.  That patch floated down like a
leaf in autumn, having been excised from the crotch of the uniform.  Keiko
smiled sadistically, and stomped out of the room, heading for no particular
reason (except to force speculation out of tons of viewers) straight to
Engineering.


                          ***********************

   The Ensign-Bimbo-Of-The-Week smiled and thought that the Captain was
talking French in a secret signal that he wanted her.
   "Merde," she thought.  "I must look that up - must be for me".  She
imagined her life as the wife of such a famous Starfleet figure, and randomly
touched her panels to look like she was concentrating.
   Meanwhile, Picard had turned and looked at Bev.  "I guess we are not yet
free from your son, Doctor."  He grimaced.  "I would like to get to the
bottom of yo- er, I mean, this, get all the ins and outs of the situation,
but how can I when all of my bridge crew has either left the show or is
cavorting on my ship?"
   Bev glanced around, made sure no one was looking, and gave the top of
Picard's head a quick rub.  "Shhh" she said. "I had left a smudge".
   "Harrumph," the captain said, and sat up straighter in his chair.


                          ***********************


   As Geordi attended to the cut on Data's leg, Riker swiftly removed the
sword from the still unconcious Keiko.  Just then O'Brian burst into the
room.
   "Well, here she is!  Is she alright?  It's been all over the comm channels
how she's been slicing and dicing every man she meets.  Horrible!" said the
Chief as he cradled his wife cautiously in his arms.
   Keiko opened her eyes and looked around groggily.  "Miles!  What am I
doing here?  What happened?  Why does my head hurt?"


                          ***********************


   Beverly's head was throbbing on the bridge after hearing the reports
of the havoc Keiko caused on a good percentage of the male population on
the Enterprise.  "I'm off to sickbay, Jean Luc.  All the transplant surgery
and prosthesis implants I'll have to perform...."
   Picard just grimaced and quickly crossed his legs as he watched Beverly
exit the bridge.  "Merde!" he mumbled under his breath.  Ensign Bimbo-of-
the-Week uttered a small EEP! at the magic word and decided now was the
time to make her move.  Quickly, she leapt into the Captain's lap and
began to kiss him all over his distinguished face.
   Just then, a bright light flooded the bridge.
   When it vanished, Q and Vash stood with arms linked congenially, decked
out in safari garb once more.
   "We're back," said Q, with a smile and twinkling eyes.


                          ***********************

   Meanwhile, RomuYar entered the turbolift and purred, "Engineering!"
   "Oh, no you don't, sister!" spat the computer voice.  "You're not going
anywhere near my android!"
   With that, the computer turned off the gravitational field in the turbo
lift and sent it plummeting down the shaft.


                          ***********************


   "Jean-Luc!" Q said mockingly.  "Your French sensibilities rising up again,
eh?"
   Picard was in a whirlwind of arms and legs trying to free himself from
the Ensign-Bimbo-Of-The-Week.  "Q!" He yelped.  "And- and VASH!"  Vash looked
brilliantly angry.
   "Jean-Luc, did you miss me that bad?"
   Picard finally managed to throw The EBOTW onto the floor where she
sprawled and squeaked, "Oh, captain!", and, springing to her feet, ran into
a turbolift and left the bridge.
   "Very well, Q.  Are the disasters on my ship your doing?"
   "Oh, Picard.  You dissappoint me.  I haven't done anything to your ship.
You humans have managed to get yourselves in this mess all by yourselves.  I
just stopped in so Vash could say hello."
   As Q said this the turbolift doors opened and out stepped a disheveled,
bloody-nosed, pissed off Romulyar with a lar ge phaser-type weapon.  "Haven't
done a THING, have you, you bastard?" the Romulyar grumbled.  "Do you think I
want to spend the rest of my life looking like this and mixing drinks?  Good
thing I made sure this weapon still works!"
   And with that she deftly fired at Q, missing him entirely but taking off
the top of Vash's head.  (And a good thing at that; she could have hit the
main viewer instead.)  Vash slumped to the ground with brains oozing all over
the carpet.  Q, startled, quickly snapped his fingers and the Romulyar became
Guinan again.  He then snapped again and Vash was standing beside him unaware
of what had just happened.
   "Guinan, you and I have got to have a talk!" Q said.
   "In a pig's eye," Guinan muttered and went back into the turbolift.  Q's
expression quickly evolved from an abashed frown to his standard smug grin.
   "Well, Jean-Luc, you have alot to clean up around here so I'll say farewell,
mon capitan.  Vash?"
   Vash smiled at Jean-Luc and said, "When you least expect it, I'll be
back".  They vanished.
   Jean-Luc sighed and got up to go into his ready room, stepping in the mess
on the carpet.  "Merde indeed," the captain groaned.


                          ***********************


   In Sickbay, Beverly found that she was the most important person on the
Enterprise.  "What a job!" she thought, and called out, "Next!"


                          ***********************

   Keiko's sword had removed the "Self-Destruct" sequence.  In Engineering,
Geordi, Data, Riker and Wes the Wonder-Boy were trying to figure out the
computer.
   "I just don't get it," Geordi said.  "Why does it still have this romantic
glitch about you, Data?"
   Data smiled innocently.  Geordi continued, "We need an expert on computer
interfacing.  Lieutenant Barclay, report to Enginnering!"
   Riker leaned over to Data.  "Close call there, Data.  No offense, but I'm
glad she went for you first."
   Data nodded.  "My replacement parts are easier to manufacture, Commander."
   Wes looked at the patch on Data's leg under the torn uniform, and said,
"Gosh!"  Surely life aboard a starship brought him close to unimaginable
possibilities.  He shuddered, and went off to build another gadget.
   Meanwhile, Troi seethed in her room, wishing she had a counselor.  In the
end, she decided to go have a drink in Ten Forward.


                          ***********************


   Guinan stormed through the doors of Ten Forward.  Happy to be restored to
her original form, she was nonetheless agitated by the recent trouble.
Eeping feebly under the crush of discarded wedding guests, Guinan's hat
peeked out into the room.  Spying its owner, the hat burst out from under the
pile, intent on landing atop its mistress's head.  In it's excitement, it
missed its mark and went careening into the food replicator.  This, with the
simultaneous Picard Manuver performed by the Captain as he tried vainly to
explain to Beverly about his previous lapful of Ensign Bimbo-of the-Week,
sent a massive surge of energy deep into the bowels of the computer core.


                          ***********************


   Meanwhile, Data made his way back down to 10 Forward.  Fully himself again
after the shock of Keiko's attack in Engineering, part of him still looked
forward to seeing his Tasha again, even in her altered Romulan form.
   "Data," said Guinan while retrieving her hat from the replicator, "Tasha
is gone.  So is RomuYar.  They were never here.  It was all a nasty trick
that Q played on all of us."
   "So it was all just an illusion," whispered Data.  "Even though my system
has been cleared of all chemical and electrical effects, I was still
anticipating seeing Tasha again."  After some thought he asked, "Guinan?  Do
you believe I will ever find a mate?  Though I cannot explain nor understand
the need for a relationship, I feel somehow incomplete."
   "The last I heard, the computer was a bit taken with you," the bartender
winked.
   "That is not exactly what I had in mind," said the android.
   But Guinan stiffled a giggle as Data tapped his communicator.  "Computer?"
   "Yes, Commander," was its efficient and businesslike response.
   "Commander?!" said Data, bewildered.  "What happened to "Honey bunch...
Sweet cheeks...Cutey?"

   "I am not familiar with those names," intoned the computer.  "Do you wish
me to located those individual's locations on board the Enterprise?"
   "No, computer.  Data out.  The computer malfunction has obviously been
repaired," he told Guinan glumly.
   "Don't take it so hard, Data," Guinan soothed. "You'll find someone to
call your own.  Very soon.  I tend to be very perceptive about these things,"
she said mysteriously.
   Just then, one lone Borg stirred among the party guest pile.  Vaguely
female in appearance, it looked up at Data and smiled a little Borgy smile
while twirling one of its/her appliances suggestively.
   "Ohhhh, no!" yelped Data.  "I am not THAT desparate!" and exited the bar
at superhuman speed.
   Guinan smiled as she swept the Borg out with the rest of the trash.


                            **** FINIS ****


   "So what do you think of my editing job?" I said.
   Data looked over my shoulder.  "You did seem to capture many of the
subtle characterized nuances," he remarked with a slightly crooked
expression.
   "Well, Deborah and Judy did all the work, Data.  My contribution wasn't
much more than just...cleaning it up a bit."
   His eyebrows narrowed as his eyes scanned and rescanned the last part of
the story.  "Might I suggest that you further personalize this work by...
adding a kind of narrative coda after the end of the story.  It is possible
that such an addition may further enhance the irreverent yet benevolent
mood of the fiction."
   "Hmmmmm," I contemplated, and began typing again.

                         Last Update : 11-23-91

This timeline is the history of all the vessels that beared the name
ENTERPRISE, from wooden sailing ships to majestic starships.

The objective of this timeline is to provide some reference to the
curious Star Trek fans, while satisfying my own curiosity.  I've always
wondered what is the history of the Enterprise.  I started some
research, and found so many contradicting dates that I decided to put
in my own educated guesses.  Here is my result.

I documented why I put things the way they are to the best of my effort
and knowledge.  Most entries are footnoted, with some explanations after
the timeline itself.

And now to explain the dates.

Everything before 2001 is based on historical research.

The PEACEKEEPER-class vessel is entirely my imagination, due to the now
relaxed global atmosphere.

The BONAVENTURE-class warp scout is a tribute to the animation episode
TAS:Time Trap, where the BONAVENTURE herself was seen.  It is almost
logical that one of its class would be named ENTERPRISE.

The DECLARATION-class transport/liner is based on older timelines, where
the ship is mentioned.  I added some details to it.

The commission date of the original NCC-1701 is 2245, given in TNG Tech
Manual, page 3.  Previous estimates are approximately 2249.  The rest of
her history was based on logical guesses.

Refitted NCC-1701 (ST:TMP) was in the year 2271 because according to
TOSN:A FLAG FULL OF STARS, they are just about to celebrate the
Tricentennial of the Apollo landing of Luna, which is mid-1969.  One and
a half year is added since the Enterprise was not yet complete at that
time.  Approximate result is 2271.










         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 33




Admiral's Morrow's comment in 2284 that the ENTERPRISE is over twenty
years old is made when the ship is 42 years old.  If one counts from the
point when the ship is rebuilt in ST:TMP, then the ship is about 12
years old...  What is Morrow counting from?  The only possibility
remaining is Morrow counted from when Kirk first took command in 2262.

Destruction of NCC-1701 in 2285 was confirmed by TNG Tech Manual page 4.

TOSN:THE RIFT have some good historical references.  The rift opens
every 33.4 years.  Due to Kirk's references in the book to his son's
death, transwarp, and so on, Kirk is on NCC-1701-A.  If the adventure
happens sometime after ST5:TFF, in year 2286, 2286-33.4=2252.6, which
coincides with early Pike's command, as Pike had already met the
Talosians at that time.

There is one more piece of information gleamed from TOSN: THE RIFT...
According to Peter David, the next time the rift opened, Federation is
involved in the Klingo-Romulan war...  Assuming the events in THE RIFT
occured soon after ST5:TFF, which is in 2286, 2286+33.4 = 2319 or
2320.  As NCC-1701-C was destroyed in 2345...  The war sure lasted a
long time!

In the episode TNG:Unification, Spock hinted at the fate of Kirk and
company.  On page 118 of the novelization, Spock said, "It was I who
asked Kirk to lead that peace mission [to the Klingons].  And I who had
to accept the responsibility for the consequences to him and his crew.
Quite simply, I am unwilling to risk anyone's life but my own on this
occasion..."  On page 119 of the novelization, Spock said, "In your
own way, you are as stubborn as another captain of the ENTERPRISE I
once knew."

From the statements, it could be inferred that NCC-1701-A, with Kirk
onboard, was lost during a peace initiative by Spock to the Klingon Empire.
Of course, this is not official, but could be inferred upon.  Since McCoy
and Spock survived, it is obviously they were not onboard at that time.
Whether other of the famous crew survived would be up to the writers.

Which raises the question whether Spock ever took captaincy of the
NCC-1701-A...  Probably not, at the present progression.  It is likely
that after the loss of Kirk, Spock quit his StarFleet commission and
became a diplomat, as we saw Ambassador Spock in TNG.

For more detailed analysis of the fate of NCC-1701-A, see my essay on
"Fate of Kirk".

A previous version of this essay/timeline stated that EXCELSIOR was
destroyed.  This was found to be incorrect.  TNG Tech Manual stated that
"Indeed, EXCELSIOR herself ultimately proved to be a distinguished part
of the Starfleet" on page 4.  NCC-1701-B is EXCELSIOR-class.  I stated
EXCELSIOR II class because the design is modified so normal warp drive
is used, not transwarp.

The launch date of the NCC-1701-B and C are estimated.








         SUB SPACE NEWS; Star trek information zine           Page 34




The destruction date of the NCC-1701-C was provided by Data in the
alternate timeline TNG:YESTERDAY'S ENTERPRISE, as having disappeared "22
years, three months, and four days ago".  Leaving the odd fractions
behind, and noting that the episode is in the fourth season, the year is
2364+3-22=2345, which is confirmed by TNG Tech Manual.

NCC-1701-D was commissioned in 2363.  Previously this was thought to
be 2364, which Data specifically stated OED year in TNG:THE NEUTRAL ZONE,
a first season episode.  However, the TNG Tech Manual specifically
stated the date of October 4th, 2363.

NOVA-class is given in TNG Tech Manual.  While we haven't decided on
which of the designs to take, the entry is included.

That's all for now...  If there are any comments about this, I am
reachable through PC-Link, America On-line, and Promenade.  Or, if you
prefer, through the US Mail service.  Address is at the front of this
essay.  Till then, happy trekkin'!

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

         Q: Can I travel up or down, in that axis? Can I travel in all
             conceivable direction? Kraig Mottar

         A: Space is somewhat spherical,  and  you  have  often  heard
             Picard  and others call out directions in this format. 23
             mark 57.  This equates to two compasses turned  at  right
             angles  to  each  other.   A heading of 0 mark 0 would be
             toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

         Q: I recently heard of Gene's death,  and  I  would  like  to
             express my condolances to his family. How can I do this?

         A: Send all cards,  letters,  and  whatever  to  the  address
             below.

         Majel Barrett-Roddenberry
         Paramount Pictures
         5555 Melrose Avenue
         Hollywood, CA  90038-3197

         Q: I am having some problems with the warp scale for the Next
             Generation.  What is the problem with attaining warp  10?
             Joseph Smith.

         A: This is very complicated, and I don't know the real answer
             myself,  so  I  will  post two rumors, and let you select
             the one you like the best.

                A. It takes an infinite amount  of  power,  and  warps
                   space too much,  so  the  ship  would  literaly  be
                   every where at the same time (infinite velocity).

                B. It takes an infinite amount of power to attain warp
                   10, but Warp 10 is not infinite velocity.

         Naturally, I believe the later.

         Q:  Where  do  you get all of your Trek information. You were
             the first one to say that Star Trek 6 was to be  released
             December  6th when everyone said December 13th.  You were
             right, and I would like to know how you knew. Brian Jones

         A: I read 6 Star Trek conferences on a daily basis, I am also
             a  member  of  three  Star  Trek  Fan clubs. I am nothing
             special. I just pass along rumors to others.

         I have been a fan of Star Trek since 1967, and I am a serious
         trekker. In fact, I read 6 Star Trek  conferences,  and  host
         three of them.

         I  host  the  Intelec,  Smart  Net,  and  Lite Link Star Trek
         conferences. I participate in the U,NI net, Ilink,  and  RIME
         Star  Trek  conferences as well. If you have access to any of
         these nets, leave a message to Bill Lambdin, and I  will  get
         back to you.

         I   am   dedicating   this  publication  in  memory  of  Gene
         Roddenberry, and to his ideals for the future.

         I hope to publish this publication on a bi-monthly  basis  to
         start. If the Trekkers support this, it may move to a monthly
         schedule.

         Live long and prosper.
