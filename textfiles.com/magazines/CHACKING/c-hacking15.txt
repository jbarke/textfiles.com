Features
   6. Click to Mode Switch:  The 40-80 Mouse switch by Michael Nausch
      (Reference: hw)
        You have graduated from a 64 to a "you'll have to pry my dead fingers
	from the keyboard" 128.  However, your favorite editor works only in
	40 column mode and your application runs in 80 column mode.  Your
	40/80 key is giving you carpal tunnel sybndrome, and you think no end
	is in sight.  Well, let Michael Nausch relieve some of your problems
	with this innovative project.
   8. The Canonical List of Commodore Produced Products, v2.0 by Jim Brain
      (Reference: list)
        In 1994, I decided to determine what specific models of CBM equipment
	I had in my collection, and I posted the results on the Internet, with
	some simple questions I had.  Well, responses came in, and thus began
	the Commodore Products List, aiming to catalog every model and
	mutation of every product Commodore ever produced.  Extended with
	information gleaned over the last year, I present version 2.0 of this
	reference work.
  11. Scott Ballantyne : Blazing into Forth - An Interview by Jim Lawless
      (Reference: forth)
        Have you ever wondered who wrote the programming language you use
	for your projects, or why?  Well, for those who have ever used Blazin'
	FORTH, here's your chance to get the scoop on how the Commodore
	implementation of FORTH came to be.
  15. Technical Information on the VIC-20 by Ward Shrake
      (Reference: vic)
        Of the CBM 8-bits, the 64/128 machines garner the most talk and
	support.  However, the VIC-20 maintains a loyal and devoted following,
	in spite of living in the shadow of its bigger brothers.  Ward Shrake
	provides some pin out information and technical notes on the "friendly
	computer", Commodore's first home computer system.

Columns
   4. Hi Tech Trickery by Sean Adams
      (Reference: trick)  
        Well, just when you thought everything about the NMOS 65XX line had
	been documented, exploited, and understood, Sean proves everyone
	wrong.  Sean discusses a previously unknown side effect of the illegal
	$AF opcode that turns on extra cicutry in the NMOS code and reduces
	cycle exuction times by almost half for 3+ cycle opcodes!  Imagine
	executing an Indirect X EOR (Opcode $41) in 3 cycles.  
  10. Hacking BASICs by Richard T. Cunningham
      (Reference: basic)
        The JAVA community does not have a monopoly on the concept of "write
	once, run anywhere".  Richard discusses ways to write your BASIC apps
	so they will run equally well on both the C64 and the C128, while
	not compromising speed or flexibility.
  13. Twiddling the Bits by Frank Kontros
      (Reference: bits)
        In this age of 33,600 bps modems with a 56K standard on the way,
	Getting by with the software UART in the 64 and 128 is even harder
	to smallow.  In the past, commercial offerings like Swiftlink and the
	new Turbo232 have offered us hope in the form of a hardware UART
	replacement.  However, many do-it-youself folks have put together the
	DataPump circuit by Perry M. Grodzinski.  Well, Frank Kontros has
	updated this useful circuit with simpler circuitry and an easier
	layout.

@(#)rch: Reading C=Hacking
  
Starting with Issue 11 of Commodore Hacking, the new QuickFind indexing 
system is utilized to aid readers of the text version in navigating the
magazine.  At the top  of each article or other important place in the
magazine, a word prefixed with a special string is present.  (See the
title of this article for an example.)  Throughout the magazine, if an
article is mentioned, it will be followed by a reference string.  For
example, if we mentioned this article, we would add (Reference: rch) after
the name.  By using your favorite editor's search function and searching
for the string after the word "Reference:", prefixed by the magic prefix
string, will move you directly to the article of choice.  To merely skip to
the next article in the magazine, search only for the magic prefix string.

Some handy indexing strings possibly not referenced anywhere are:

top      top of issue
bottom   bottom of issue
contents table of contents
legal    legal notice

For those with access to a UNIX system, the command "what" can be
run on the issue, which will result in all the article titles being
printed.

A slightly different magic prefix string "@(A)" is used to delimit
sub-topics or main heading in articles.  The text after the magic string
differs depending on article content.  For the Input/Output column
(Reference: io), the text after the magic prefix will either be "c" for 
comment, or "r" for response.  In features and columns, a number after
the prefix indicates the ordinal of that heading or sub-topic in the
article.  If a specific sub-topic is referenced elsewhere in the article,
a sub-topic reference will be indicated.  A reference to "@(A)r" would
be written as "(SubRef: r)".

As time goes on, the role of this indexing system will be expanded and
changed to ease navigation of the text version, but minimize the clutter
added by these extra items.

@(#)editor: The Hacking Editor
            by Jim Brain (editor@mail.jbrain.com)

Better Late Than Never

Unless you've been offline and out of touch for the past year, you've no doubt
wondered what happened to Commodore Hacking.  Many thought we had given up the
ghost.  Well, we are still kicking, although a lot has changed in the time
since issue #14 went out.  Readers deserve an explanation for our absence, but
I'll try to keep it short. 

The Hacking Headquarters move in '96 delayed issue 13, which delayed issue 14,
even though I tried unsuccessfully to meet the issue 14 October 1996 deadline.
I tried to edit issue 15 in January 1997, but stopped due to a low number of
technical articles.  C=H received some criticism after issue 13 for its
"diminishing technical content", so I wanted to make sure issue 15 didn't 
disappoint.  The article selection improved by May, but a post in comp.sys.cbm
caused work to stop, and I didn't pick up the work again until August.  At
that time, I chatted with Stephen Judd, who motivated me to get back on the
issue.  However, just when things started rolling again, my wife took ill, and
that brings us to a few weeks ago.  In short, it's been a trying time for
your editor, but things are finally looking better.  Not only is the issue
taking shape, but my wife's illness has a silver lining: a tiny BRAIN will be
joining us in late July.

The astute reader have noticed a trend developing, but I'll clarify.  It's
safe to say I have more than a few CBM projects in progress, Commodore Hacking
being just one.  The above underscores the fragile nature of my environment at
present, and I have been warned that chaos will rule starting in August.  So,
it's time to make some changes.  The delay for this issue is unacceptable to
me, even considering my explanation, and I do not wish to "kill" the
publication; I took over editorship expressly to continue this fine journal.

With this issue, It is with bittersweet feelings that I formally turn the
editorial office over to Stephen Judd.  I am convinced that Steve can take
this publication into new territory and satisfy even the most discerning of
technical reader.  I regret that I can no longer provide this publication with
the attention it deserves, but I find happiness in returning as a reader and
"sometimes" article writer, if Steve deems my work worthy of merit :-).  I'll
comfort myself with issue 16. I'll just print it out and peruse it at my
leisure.

Since I still hold the office, I'll introduce our new editor, and hopefully
set the correct expectations for the future of Commodore Hacking.

In 1995, when Craig Taylor (the originator of C=H) graduated and inquired
about a editorial successor, Steve and I both applied.  If memory recalls,
Steve was active at school, so I took the editorship.  Now, my operating
environment is less stable.  I rather think of it as "tag team editting".  

Steve brings with him a desire to focus more intently on technical articles
and projects.  During my tenure as editor, I've tried to create a more
"balanced" publication, based on the status of CBM publications in 1995, when
I started.  In fact, Craig Taylor, this publication's originator, applauded
the changes.  Nontheless, Craig's early work set the tone for this
publication, and I've been remiss in maintaining the level and number of
technical articles.  Steve and I still feel the "lighter fare" I've introduced
has merit, but we think the two should exist in separate publications.  To that
end, Commodore Hacking will concentrate on delivering plenty of technical
content, while I am investigating a monthly newsletter publication for the
less technical items.  This way, the less technical readers won't have to wait
for three months or more for a new installment of Hack Surfing, but the
technical readers can concentrate on new algorithms and applications.  

Steve runs with the technical crowd more than I.  This has distinct benefits
when publishing a technical magazine.  After I took over in 1995, some regular
C=H writers had to forego authoring for the publication.  That left me
scrambling to find new talent to write.  Aside from being one of the regular
contributors, Steve knows many folks with new ideas and concepts that can only
benefit from publication in this journal.  

So, many changes will accompany issue 16, and I feel confident that most will
welcome the changes.  However, there are a number of items that will not
changes:

Commodore Hacking will always succeed or fail on the quality of its content,
not Steve's editorship ability.  With this new direction, technical articles 
will comprise the bulk of the publication.  If you enjoy the technical aspects
of the CBM platform, I ask that you support this journal with an article about
your insights or discoveries.  It cannot succeed without you.

www.jbrain.com will continue to host the home page for Commodore Hacking.  I
will need to retool the site to convert the new issues, but text issues will
always be available, and you can continue to contact the editor of Commodore
Hacking at editor@mail.jbrain.com.  In addition, the chacking distributions
lists will continue to be offered at jbrain.com.  In short, only the editor
and the style are changing.

I would like to thank all of you for supporting Commodore Hacking.  In
addition, I would like to thank the article contributors.  Without you, there
would be no publication.  And to those who think I am moving on, save your
concerns.  I am not discontinuing support for Commodore, just making some room
in my schedule for some family (and baby) time.

Enjoy YOUR magazine,

Dear C=Hacking,
       
I've hit the jackpot...
Browsing the Web under the topic C64 I hit this treasure trove
of information, all neatly laid out waiting to be downloaded.

You are a total and utter star!

Keep up the excellent work.

Kind Regards,

@(A)r: 
Well, <blush> I am not sure I deserve the credit.  I simply package what the
Commodore technical community offers and disseminate it to the public.  The
success of Commodore Hacking ahs more to do with the quality of the folks who
compose the content than the dude that pastes it together.  So, this goes out
to all the past and present article contributors to Commodore Hacking.

@(A)c: The "Virtual 1541" Revisited
       	
From: HOFMAN%NLEV00@btmv56.se.bel.alcatel.be (Peter Hoffman)
		 				
Dear C=Hacking,
       
In issue #14 of C=Hacking, there was a small article about a virtual 1541.  
You wrote: "The closest thing as yet is the 64NET package, which allows you to
load and save programs to the IBM PC hard drive like it was a regular CBM 
drive." I do not agree, I tried an old version of SERVER64, and it comes much 
closer, since it uses the same cable as X1541, so you just need to build a 
cable. 64NET is a bit more complicated.

I do not know where I got it and who wrote it, but I will look that up. The 
version I have at home, has some flaws, but I used it with a 286-12MHz PC and 
that worked.

Regards,

Peter Hofman

@(A)r: 
We stand corrected.  SERVER64 offers the advantage over 64NET that no code
modifications are needed to programs to allow them to "see" the virtual drive.
The downside of SERVER64 is the slow speed of the serial bus (64NET uses a
parallel cable).  So, users have two choices for a "virtual drive".  For yet
another offering, see the next letter:

@(A)c: The "Virtual 1541" Revisited, Part 2

From: Torsten Paul <paul@os.inf.tu-dresden.de>
       	

Dear C=Hacking,

I have good news about your statement about a "Virtual 1541" in Issue 14:

I've written a program that emulates the standard serial protocol with a PC 
(under DOS). This makes it possible to load files without any special software 
on the C64 side. The only thing needed is a so called 'X1541 cable' to connect 
the C64 to the PC.  It's not possible to load disk sectors or read drive memory
and for fastloaders there is no chance at all, because there is no
hardware emulation. But you can transparently access disk images, tape
images and lynx archives.

The program is quite new and not very well tested on different
platforms but it works on my two PCs at home (a 486DX4/100 and a
really old 386sx/25).

It's available under 'http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~paul/VC1541/'.

Torsten.

@(A)r:
We tahnk you for the information.  So now, users have not one, but three
choices if they want to use an IBM PC as a glorified file server.  How ironic
that a PC would be used in such a way.

Dear C=Hacking,
       
I'd just like to say that you're doing a terrific job with this mag!

Also: could you make multiple copies of C=Hacking? (a "small" version
and a full blown version) I divide my time between Commodores and PC's
pretty evenly, and since I read your mag on a PC with about 200 megs of
free space, size is no object to me. So PLEASE! Pack it with stuff!

@(A)r: 
Well, as we noted above, we appreciate the great reviews, but we really need
to pass on those congratulations to the authors and contributors.  

As for your request for two versions of Commodore Hacking, your wish has been
granted, at least in a roundabout way.  Check out "The Hacking Editor"

From: Marcus Ickes <ickes@iglobal.net>
		 				
Dear C=Hacking,

I read your article on spending your savings on the VIC instead of the
TI.  When I was 16 years old, I got the TI99/4A, I want to say, you are
right when you said you were fortunate to get the Commodore computer
instead.   I learned to program in BASIC and did a good job, but that
was all I could do.  I got an old C64 a few year ago and I am impressed
with the engineering that went into it.  It is a very well made
computer.  If I got that when I was 16, I would have learned much more
than just BASIC.  Thanks for all your hard work putting out Commodore
articles.  I'm going to start reading them from the first one and try to
learn the machine language. 

Marcus Ickes  (ickes@iglobal.net) 

@(A)r: 
Well, in spite of our subject, we don't want to slam the TI folks.  However,
I am very happy fate brought me and the CBM together at that time.  At the
time, it seemed like I lost out, but 20/20 hindsight tells a different story.

@(A)c: "First Computer" Stories, Take 2
       	
From: Lyle Kopnicky <qseep@ae.net>
		 				
Dear C=Hacking,
       
Wow!  I'm excited about your magazine.  My first computer was a C64, which
lasted from 1982 to 1984.  My parents replaced it with another which I used
until 1986, when I got a C128.  I used that faithfully until 1990 when I got
an Amiga 2000.  In 1993 I attempted to upgrade it, but a crack in the
motherboard kept me frustrated for a year or two.  Finally, I broke down and
bought a Gateway 2000 in 1995, on which I run Linux and Windows 95.  I've
hacked away on all those machines, although it isn't much fun in Windows.  I
now have access to a working C64, 1541, and Datasette, and occasionally a
C128/1571.  I also found a great C64 emulator for Windows 95/NT called PC64.
My friends and I just set up a 4-machine network, and we'll be installing
Red Hat Linux on a couple of machines.  We're looking forward to a lot of
hacking fun, and have considered using a C64 or Apple II as a part of the
network.  Your e-zine will be a great help!

I'm happy to say I will be able to contribute as well.  Two years ago,
over Christmas break, I worked on an interesting C64 software project,
designed to take the machine to previously untouched territory.  I spent a
week or two working on a Scheme interpreter for the 64.  If you're not
familiar with Scheme, it's a simple but powerful variant of Lisp.  I
actually made quite a bit of progress, but abandoned it when I no longer had
access to the development machine (a C128 in 64 mode).  Now, with the
availability of the C64 emulator, it will be easier to develop and test this
software.

I had thought that perhaps no one would find this software useful any
longer, but I see now that I have an audience.  I'll get back on this
project sometime, hopefully soon.  Thanks for editing this great e-zine!

@(A)r: 
YES!  Scheme needs to be on the 64/128.  Please let us know when you get going
on the project again.  It never ceases to amze us what seemingly "impossible"
projects and products manage to appear on the 64/128 platform.

@(A)c: The 'I's Have It!
       	
From: epratt@andrews.edu (Eric Pratt)

Dear C=Hacking,

I am pretty happy about the C=Hacking magazine.  I access it through lynx at 
Andrews University.  I love to read it from my 64 using Novaterm and I tried 
to download it recently.  But, when I did, I got a few letter 'i's.  I 
contacted Nick Rossi about this and he said that the i's were tabs when there 
should have been spaces.  I would like to save this as a seq file for my word 
processor (Easy Script) but I don't want to have to edit every issue.  That 
would take a load of time!  I am downloading the text version of course and I 
would like to know if there is any way to get around the tabs.  I would just 
like to download and print to paper.  I appreciate your time and your magazine.

Thanks.
Eric Pratt

@(A)r: 
The earliest issues do indeed exhibit this problem, due to the way they were
created (on UNIX).  When we get some time and motivation, we'll fix the
problem.

However, in the meantime, folks with a rudimentary grasp of BASIC should be
able to write a "quick and dirty" app that simple reads in the C=H issue from
disk, searches for and replaces every occurence of a TAB char (we're pretty
sure its 12, but check with your handy reference guide) with 3 or 4
spaces, and writes out the results to a separate file.

From: Piotr Walczak <piwa@loxinfo.co.th>

Dear C=Hacking,

Just to let you know - I heartly agree with your writing.
My adventure with computers started somewhere around 1982.
Actually it changed my life. Now as computer professional,
dealing everyday with the latest computer technology,
I am recalling amazement of my first computer experience
with VIC-20. Miracle of *programming* =), PEEKing and
POKEing memory, frantic drive to master ML, ROM hacking.
It opened whole new world and turns to be very emotional
unforgetable experience. I guess, there is a lot of people
feeling this way.

Cheers, Piotr

P.S. I really pity those clueles guys who compare 8-bits
     to Pentium. They are lacking something very important,
     something what distinguish USERS from lUSERS =)

@(A)r: 
I read the other day how the embedded computer field is having trouble finding
employees who can write code in ML that will fit in the cramped quarters of
the embedded computer platforms in use today.  It seems most new graduates
can;t fathom that in todays 64 bit multiple megabyte world, the world is
mostly run by machines with are blessed with an 8 bit micro, RAM is a luxury,
programs MUST be in ML, and 64 kB of program space is almost unheard of.

From: chuck.sommerville@3do.com (Chuck Sommerville)

Dear C=Hacking,

I wrote a few games for the C64 a while back. Reading your stuff about the
C64 brought back some fond memories.  I thought I pushed that machine to
its limits back when I worked for EPYX.  I see There was still some room to
do some other wierd stuff.  The worst this I ever did was the raster code
for Ball Blazer, which had to figure out whether there were 63, 64, or 65
cycles on the scan line, and run 8 different pieces of interrupt code
depending on how close to the 40 lost cycles it was.  The problem was that
I had to write to 2 color registers on two consecutive lines.  This is a
problem if you have to do it on the bad line.  I had to get the timing down
to the cycle, syncronized by a timer tuned to the horizontal rate.  It
actually had to lose the 40 cycles in the middle of a particular
instruction.  You should have seen the jury rigged logic analyser we built
to see the timing!

Well, I probably don't have time to read all the back issues of C= hacking,
but it is fun to see this is still a topic of discussion.

Sincerely,

Chuck Sommerville.

@(A)r: 
All we can say is, WOW!  We bet there are hundreds of stories like this, where
the programmer simply didn't take NO for an answer, and made the 64/128 do
what needed to be done.

From: lpar@toto.pitton.com

Dear C=Hacking,

I just *knew* I'd seen something about an idea for a HTML viewer for the C64, 
found it last night in Hacking #13. I just recently got interested in this, 
and was wondering what the status is on this project?  I wish I could be of 
some help in contributing to its development, but I'm just not that good a 
programmer, and my experience with writing HTML documents goes back, uh, 
almost a week. :) From what little I do know of it, I'd think it could be 
done, at least most of the important stuff. Maybe a highlighted routine 
similar to Lynx browsers, with different colors for the different <Hn> 
markers, for instance?

Anyway, just got to wondering. Thanks.

Steve

@(A)r: 
You are correct.  I started an HTML article series, and I do hope to finish
it.  When I started the series, I hoped that by the time the first installment
came out or a little while after, a TCP/IP protocol stack would arrive for the
64, and I could write the HTML viewer to sit on top of that.  Well, the TCP
stack has not yet arrived, and I lost some motivation.  But, it's been moved
up on my list of projects, since I now need a viewer for the 64/128 for some
work I am doing.  Nothing like neccessity to get you going.

From: "Kevin Rowan" <k-rowan@midcoast.com.au>

Dear C=Hacking,

Over here in Australia, sources of cutting-edge Commodore article
es and hardware/software hacks are even harder to find than they are in 
the USA. I've been studiyng your publication schedule for a number of 
months now, eagerly awaiting C=Hacking Issue 15. Can you say when it might
be published? Has something gone wrong?

From: rikard.l@home.se (Rikard Lundblad)

Dear C=Hacking,

Is C-Hacking still active?  I just found this site and I can see that no 
issues at all was published during 1997.

Are all issues available in the .zip-format?

From: Ernst Stavro Blofeld <SPECTRE@jhu.edu>

Dear C=Hacking,

I found C=Hacking in the middle of last year and discovered who much I
could still learn about the Commodore.  Since I have waited and waited
but not gotten any mailings.  (I think I have since unsubscribed.)

My questions are why do the issue dates on the HTML/TEXT versions not
agree with the publication dates in your web-page, and why have the
publication dates after Nov96 not been adhered to?  Are there no
submittions and C=Hacking has shut down??

I know there is a great deal of information being gathered and acted on,
just from emailing other Commodore enthusiasts.  Also many of the
C=Hacking articles were "To Be Continued..." and never were.  Please
enlighten me.

Alex (aka Blofeld)

@(A)r: 
Yes, we're mighty late.  The full scoop on the reasons is spelled out in "The
Hacking Editor" (Reference: editor), so we won't reprint it here.  However,
everyone seemed to have a secondary question when asking about when the next
issue was to arrive, so let's tackle those:

George Taylor:  As per the copyright, users can reproduce and redistribute the
issues without any problems.  As for conversions to HTML, Make sure you do not
alter the magazine contents except to mark it up in the HTML format.  

Rikard Lundblad:  Only Issues 11 on are available in ZIPped format.  If time
permits, we'll convert the older issues to this format.

Ernst Stavro Blofeld: Well, submissions did fall off, but the main reason the
dates are wrong is that they were never strict.  I had tried to get an issue
out every 3 months, and I based the schedule on that, but quickly determined
that it's tough to stay on target with this magazine.

In any case, you are now reading issue #15, and I hope that everyone will
forgive the publisher for being late.

@(A)c: The Mystery Logo Designer Unvieled

From: "Lawrence, Mark" <Mark.Lawrence@regency.tafe.sa.edu.au>

Dear C=Hacking,

It's been a very long time since I'd heard anything about the C= Hacking 
publication, but the other day I'd received an email from someone or other who
had read one of the early editions, and my article (sad as it was), and had
questions to ask of me!

I sniffed around, found that C= Hacking had not only continued on but evolved 
into something much bigger and better, and it still has the big ascii C=Hacking 
logo I designed at the top!!!  Wow...

Still awestruck,

Mark.Lawrence@Regency.TAFE.SA.Edu.Au
(also 9152427d@lv.levels.unisa.edu.au)

@(A)r: 
So, you're the one who penned our mighty logo.  Well, it's been rightly
attributed to you on this issue, and we appreciate the check-in after a long
trip.  My hope is that C=H makes it to 2001, so we can revel in the new
century with our magazine and maxhines.

@(A)c: CBM and Satellites: Bosom Buddies!

From: Alex Measday <c.a.measday@ieee.org>

Dear C=Hacking,

Hi!  I liked your web site when I happened upon it a year or so ago
(back when it was "garnet.msen.com") - you seemed to be a real
Renaissance type of guy! - and I just recently revisited it (via
Alta-Vista because your address had changed).  I thought you
might appreciate the following, Commodore-related story.

Our company is building the ground control system for AT&T's next
Telstar satellite, to be launched in May.  (As you might have heard, one
of the existing Telstar satellites was killed off by the solar magnetic
burst in January.)  Although the telemetry rate is fairly slow, the
system is pretty high-tech: Solaris workstations, VME PowerPCs running
LynxOS, and special hardware for encoding/decoding the command and
telemetry data streams.

We've been flowing simulated telemetry data through the system, but a
couple of weeks ago, we were provided with actual spacecraft telemetry
(from ground tests of the satellite).  When we opened the box that had
been shipped to us, we found: an ordinary looking cassette tape and an
old COMMODORE tape drive with a little adapter box for the type of cable
we use!  We plugged it in, pushed the PLAY button, and watched as our
system locked on to real telemetry data.

(The tape drive was one of those about the size of a small book with
rounded edges.  That must have been a newer model than the big, boxy
drive I had on my VIC-20.)

This is an incredible story.  After a while, even the most optimistic CBM
owner can lose morale after months of PC and Mac stories.  This little tidbit
gives each of us a boost.  Besides, its a very impressive story in its own
right.

@(#)trick: Hi Tech Trickery: Double Speed Opcodes
           by Sean Adams (sean_adams@junkmail.net)

@(A)intro: Introduction

Well, if you have made a bee-line to this section, I hate to disappoint you,
but:

    April Fools!

Sean Adams, if he did exist, would have no idea how to set the 65XX into a
mode that executes all 3+ cycle opcodes twice as fast.  Frankly, it just
cannot be done.  All 3+ cycle opcodes need those cycles, and the only way to
speed up the process would be to double the clock frequency.

So, rest assured that the laws of 65XX operation cannot be broken, at least
not in this area.

However, before we finish, let me state that the clock doubling approach is
precisely how the new Intel CPUs achieve their high numbers.  FOr example, the
333 MHz Pentium II processor doesn't actually run that fast.  First of all, it
can only interact with registers at that speed.  The high speed cache operates
at 1/2 that frequency, or 166.5 MHz.  The cache is only 256kB or 512 kB
(although I hear 1MB cache processors are appearing soon), so any function or
code fragment that won't fit in that space requires a read from main memory,
which runs at 66 MHz at best case (and can run much slower).  So, be wary of
taking speeds of the newer processors at face value.  If we could do to the 64
what they do to the Pentium II, we too could have a very fast "looking"
processor speed.

@(#)hw: The 40/80 Screen Mouse Switch 
        copyright (c) 1994-1997 by Michael Nausch (bigchief@muc.de)

Editor Note:  An archive containing this article and the GEOPaint pictures
described within it are available in "Hacking the Code" (Reference: code,
SubRef: 4080schematic).

@(A): Introduction

In 1994, I wrote an article for our club newspaper "Rundschreiben", issue 28 
(GEOS Interessengemeinschaft SUED e.V.) describing my "40/80 Screen-Switch" 
hardware extension that allows me to easily switch my monitor between 40 and 
80 column modes using the keys on my mouse. After several club members and 
friends in the fido-areas and internet-newsgroups asked me if I would sell 
the 40/80 Screen-Switch, I decided to write this article and translate it to 
English. I'd like to thank Gaelyne Gasson, who encouraged me and added the 
final touches to the English translation.

What this hardware extension will do, and what it won't or can't do:

 1. It is not 'plug and play' hardware. You must modify your monitor.
 2. It won't automatically switch the mode of your monitor.
 3. Because the layout and other plans are in full size GeoPaint format, 
    it should be relatively easy for anyone to build the 40/80 Screen-Switch.

@(A): Background Information

I built this switch for myself because I was too lazy to press the button on 
my monitor to switch it from CVBS (40 column) to RGB (80 column) mode and vice
versa. I am a GEOS enthusiast and use GEOS for nearly all my C=128 activities.
I use other software only for the internet and bbsing, such as Novaterm, 
Dialogue 128 or QWKRR128. Some of these programs uses both 40 and 80 
column-modes, too. A lot of my GEOS software runs only in 40 column, so I 
am often switching from one mode to the other and vice versa.

Most of my software gives me a hint on screen when I should switch my monitor,
and I originally considered using the CS input of the video chips and/or 
converting the CVBS signal to RGB, but both were rejected as too complex or 
too expensive. Since my mouse is always at hand, it seemed more practical for 
the job.

After looking at the circuit diagram of my monitor I thought it should be 
easy to do this. First I removed the original switch for changing the 
40/80-mode and soldered a 5ft long cable to it for testing, if the monitor 
worked right, (it did) I would carry on with my experiments.

Since the first step was done I needed to find a way to comfortably switch 
the monitor modes. I didn't want to alter the mouse, because otherwise I 
would have to do it every time I use another mouse. Modifying the keyboard 
seemed impracticable, so I decided to make a little "black box" to go between 
the mouse and the monitor.

Whenever I pressed both mouse buttons simultaneously I wanted the monitor to 
change mode. I dismantled my mouse and looked at what was happening when I 
pressed both buttons. I found that when I press the left button, the 
'BUTTON A/LP' line (pin #6) is put to signal-ground. If the right button is 
pressed, the line 'JOYA0' (pin #1) is put to signal-ground. I also noted 
pin #7 had 5V DC, and since I had many chips of the 74xx family in my 
electronics parts box, I decided to make the circuit with those IC's.

The first IC is a NOR-gate 7402. This gate will only output a "high" if both 
inputs are "low". As noted above, if I press both mouse-buttons at the same
time, pins #1 and #6 of joy-port #1 are both taken "low" and only then will
the NOR-gate output a "high". This output is connected to the next IC, a 
monostable multivibrator 74121. The keys of the mouse have an unpleasant
property, the bounce. Everyone has probably experienced this; one only has 
to copy a GEOS-file, click on the icon and suddenly the file is opened. To 
avoid this bounce, if the input of the 74121 IC is set to "high", the output 
changes level only after awhile. If the input changes during this period, 
nothing happens at the output. After the predefined time, the output can be 
changed, but it changes the input. This time is dependant on the resistor R3 
and the capacitor C1. For the 40/80Screen-Switch, I use approximately 0.6 
seconds.

The output of the 74121 is connected with the clock input of a JK flip-flop 
7473. One of the reasons the external wiring of the 7473 works is because 
it is a D-type flip-flop. So every change to the input will change the output 
of the 7473. With the help of a little NPN-transistor, we control a 5V DC 
relay. The switch in front of this transistor allows us to switch the 
monitor-mode by hand into 40 or 80 column-mode, or use the 
automatic-operation. Because the JOYA0 and BUTTON A/LP lines are connected 
directly to the keyboard, we must isolate our hardware from the keyboard. 
To do this, we use the pull-up resistors R1 and R2 and diodes V1 and V2.

To prevent damage from induced voltage produced by the relay a diode is 
connected antiparallel with it's windings.

@(A): Constructing the 40/80 screen-switch

Enough with the theory, now for the construction. First we must etch the
printed board. For printing the included GeoPaint file it's recommended 
that you use a laser-or a true 80x80 dpi printer. If you have not etched 
a printed board, ask a friend to help you. It's also possible to build 
the circuit using the wirewrap technique or any other preferred technique. 
After etching and cleaning the printed board, you must drill the holes for 
the electronics. After that we bend the 13 little wire-jumpers and solder 
them into the right places. Next we solder the diodes, (check the circuit 
diagram for correct polarity) then the resistors, sockets for the IC's, 
the capacitor and then the relay. Finally we connect the on/off-switch and 
the nine-pin sub-d connectors to the 40/80 Screen-Switch. If you use the 
special flat cable version of the connectors, you can also use the special 
pin-sockets that were used in the industry and in personal computers. Last 
but not least, you are almost ready to test your new hardware.

Inspect the printed circuit board and make sure that all solder joints 
are O.K. and there's no solder splashes on the board. If everything is 
okay you can put the new hardware into a box or stand it on plastic feet. 
Connect the 40/80 Screen-Switch between your C=128 and mouse and then 
make the connection to your monitor. You can now switch on your computer 
and your monitor. With the double on/off switch you should now be able 
to switch your monitor from the CVBS (40 column) to RGB (80 column) mode 
and vice versa. If the switch is in "automatic" you should be able to 
switch the monitor-mode by pressing both mouse-buttons simultaneously. 
If it doesn't work, switch off your equipment and check all solder 
joints, the electronic parts for the right placement and the etched 
printed board for any hairline cracks. Correct any errors and test it 
again.

@(#)fido: FIDO's Nuggets
          by Geoff Sullivan (sunfish@gis.net)
 	    		     				
In mid October Gaelyne Gasson reported in the CBM Geos Echo on a
meeting of the Lansing Area Commodore Club she attended. There Maurice
Randall (geoFax, geoShell, etc.) demonstrated new Geos device drivers
that work with all types of drives and desktops. He showed drivers
that will read an MS-DOS formatted disk directly into Geos, and how a
stock 1581 can read a CMD FD disk. This is all part of his goal to
revamp the Geos OS, ridding it of bugs, and adding features that
would make it more compatable with toady's hardware and future
software. Since this prewiew the Echo's been buzzing with
suggestions and speculations about this development.
 
In the more general topic Commodore Echo there have been a number of
discussions that have been ongoing. There has been a thread
about 1541 disk drive alignment for some time. There is always one
new person that decides his drive has alignment problems and needs
advice. I know, this has happened to me too. There are several ways
to go about this process and one or another always comes up. Recently
there was a very good and complete description of the process.
 
Another thread is covering the baud vs. bps argument, and the limits
of data compression with v.42bis protocol. There is a lot of interest
in the performance of various modems with Swiftlink on a C64 or 128.
Street prices of 14.4 and even 28.8 modems have been dropping to such
a degree that performance is more significant than cost since we are
no longer resrticted to Commodore compatables. Ismael Cordeiro posted
an exhaustive history/tutorial of modem data transfer schemes. What
really seems to determine transfer rates are the types of data used.
Plain text, which is easily compressed appears to move faster than
compressed data, such as binary files and .GIFs, etc.
 
Software topics have decreased, but FTP by email and other Internet
discussions have grown.  Many people are now using email to get files
from Commodore Web sites all over the world.  In fact it is even
possible now to receive FIDO Echo packets via FTP if you can't get
them any other way!
 
The C128 Echo is a little more into hardware that the other two Echos.
In the last few months someone wanted to know how to upgrade his VDC
ram to 64K.  There were many answers, all correct.  The most
important being, "If you don't know what you're doing, get someone
who does."
 
Someone else wants to build a portable power supply for his C128 so he
can take it on "remotes".  The easy soluton would be to use an
inverter, but it was suggested that this might be considered
cheating.  We are a tough lot!!

More new folks are showing up on the Commodore FIDO echoes.  Some lost
souls are returning too.  We keep seeing messages about someone having
found a C64 in a closet and wanting to get software or Internet access
for it.  In fact there is a lot of Internet related traffic here.
Many folks new to Lynx and Unix servers in general are asking
questions and getting help.  Those of us that have Commodore related
Web sites are able to direct people there for software too.
 
QWKRR is evolving into an Internet friendly off-line reader and reply
application.  Discussion continues about it.  Presently it centers
around REU access and character sets.  Rod Gasson, the author, has
been asked to impliment REU support.  The problem seems to be that in
it's current version QWKRR has no room for it without module swapping.
 
With more of us on the Internet there is some discussion about an
application to unzip files zipped with 2.04g and better ways of
dealing with .GIF and .JPG files.  To date there is nothing that can
deal with 2.04g zips directly and viewing .GIF or .JPG graphics could
be better.  One bright note is that there has been developed an HTML
off-line viewer for the C64.  The demo version is on the FairLight Web
page at http://hem.passagen.se/harlekin/
 
There is always someone looking for Commodore hardware/software as
well as folks selling it here.  About 1/3 of the traffic on the echoes
is devoted to this.
 
Some discussion in the C128 echo has been around character sets and
terminal emulation.  What are ANSI control characters, how can they be
displayed or stripped, and what are the differences between Unix,
MS-Dos, Commodore "screen code", and Petscii text? Several short
programs in Basic have appeared to translate text formats.
 
In the Geos echo there has been a thread about the most efficient ways
of formatting text in geoWrite.  Whether to add tabs and margins
before or after composing text seems to be the question.  There are
some tools for global formatting and font changing, but few use them.
 
Printers are always an interesting challenge in Geos.  With all the
used equipment floating around there is always someone here that is
having trouble finding the right driver for a newly aquired device.
(Note: I think it would be worth it to have an ftp site loaded with
all the various non-commercial printer drivers.)
 
With the release of Maurice Randall's geoFAX 2.0, at least one user
has figured out a way to print geoFAX pages in a pre-determined order
by changing the order of the pointers in the Geos VLIR index sector.
Each pair of bytes on this page points to the corresponding page of
the geoFAX document.  By rearranging the order, pages can be printed
or displayed any way the user wishes.  This may be tedious, but with
a little more work an application could be worked up to make this
process easier.  The same could be done with geoWrite.
 
So, that's a glimpse into the world of FIDO, the wonder dog of networks, 
for this time. 
 
Here, boy....

@(#)list: The Canonical List of Commodore Products
          by Jim Brain (brain@mail.jbrain

@(A): Introduction

It's been so long, I almost forget what actually started this list, but I
believe I decided one day while at work that I wanted to create a full listing
of everything that had made it past the dream phase at Commodore.  I wanted to
catalog the various models of C64, the constantly evolving C2N datasette, the
specifications on the complete PET/CBM business line, etc.  So, I posted what
I did know to the USENET comp.sys.cbm newsgroup, and the responses came
pouring in.  For a while, the list sported no version number, but I finally
started creating versions in 1995.  It's been almost a year since 1.1 came
out, and I have made numerous changes to the list since then.  However, the
number of computer additions has slowed to a trickle, so I suspect that I've
catalogued most of the models out there.  Now, people are sending more
calculator and specialty Amiga board additions.  

However, this list has outgrown its current format, and will be converted into
a database that I can more easily update and manage.  As well, I would like to
create an online hyperlinked version that sports pictures and more space for
comments on each model.  No one realizes that I have to greatly condense the
information folks send me on some of these models to fit the space I have
here.  The new format will allow more room for neat comments and anecdotes.  
I will, though, create a script that parses the database to generate this file
from the information.  

So, delete your old copy of the list, and save this one for future reference.
If I have erred in some information, please take the opportunity to send me
corrections, and note the locations of the file below.  I continually update
the file, and you can check in VICUG at http://www.jbrain.com/vicug/ for
information on where the online HTML version will be kept.

@(A): CBM List of Products

Archive-name: cbm-model-list.2.0.txt
Version: 2.0
Last-modified: 1998-04-11

Here is the newest edition of the Canonical List of Commodore Products.  It
contains informations on every piece of Commodore equipment I have heard of 
to date.  Please help me weed out all the inconsistencies and nail down all
the information.

==========================Notes for this Release==============================

PET models were also named with CBM prefixes. i.e PET 4016 = CBM 4016.

Difference in naming early PETs exist.  A PET 2001-8N could also be
referred to as a PET 2001N-8K or PET 2001N-8.  All are the same machine.

Since the decision to boot in lowercase or uppercase mode was based on
type of ROM, any machine can boot in either. 

If you know of a model that is listed above that had differing properties,
please tell me.  Examples are a bigger monitor than what I have listed,
Different closing mechanism on Drive, etc.  

This list comprises all machines that have been put out in some market.
For this reason, the 364, C65, and others are include in the second
list at the end of this document.

The stars indicate that someone has seen this machine in production.
Their friends own one, etc.

The two letters at far right indicate that someone owns this machine.
The names are in Mnemonic, and the expansions are directly above these 
notes.

Before emailing me with updates to an item, please make sure the item number 
is not alrady in the list.  Sometimes I have people tell me that X is a 
disk drive, when X is in the list already as something else.  I can't tell
which one is right, so if you find contradictory info, please acknowledge
that your info does not match mine and what your opinion is regarding which
info is correct.

Any item that has letters after it in the far right column not only exists,
but is owned by someone.  Now, a typo is always possible, but please keep
that in mind when telling me an item was never made, since Commodore 
sometimes never marketed an item in some countries.

I put in any item that I think _might_ have made it to market, so everyone
needs to continually check up on me.  

There list is in two parts: Marketed and Not-Marketed, since some models
were produced but never sold at the time of production (C65 is one of them),
and some models never got past the "pipe-dream" stage.

======================Questions Still Left to Answer==========================

The PET 2001NT:  Which PET 2001 was it, 08,16,32?

Some needs to explain to me why the 700 model is an LP machine when the rest
of the 700 line are HP machines....

ony Scatt sent me some discussion about the CBM 3000 model, mentioning an 11
key keyboard variant and a 20 key kaeyboard variant.  I have noted below that
some 3000 machines were simply rebaded 2001 machines.  Does that explain the
11/20 discrepency?

I need to go through Andre Fachat's PET Index and synchronize information,
but I need time to do so.   You can peruse it at

For those who can access that great expanse of area called the World 
Wide Web, here are some new places to visit that are of interest to the 
Commodore community.  In early 1994, when the US Commodore WWW Site 
started, the number of sites online that catered to Commodore numbered 
in the 10's.  Now, the number is in the 100's.  What a change. 
 
If you know of a site that is not listed here, please feel free to send 
it to the magazine.  The following links have been gleaned from those 
recently changed or added to _CaBooM! - Your One Stop Commodore Links Site_.
(http://www.jbrain.com/caboom/).
 
Due to the large number of sites in the list this time, we're simply printing
out the information on each site.  The information comes directly from the
entry in CaBooM!, and no attempt has been made to correct grammar or spelling.
You can review them for yourself.

@(#)basic: Hacking BASICs
           by R. T. Cunningham (wanderer_rtc@pipeline.com) 
 
@(A): Introducation

In this article, I'd like to introduce you to some concepts.  "Common RAM"
is what I like to call the RAM that is safe and usable by both the 64 and
128 for either storage or short ML routines while BASIC is resident.  
"Common BASIC" is what I like to call the code that can operate equally
well under either BASIC 2.0 or 7.0.  "Common ML" is what I like to call ML
that can be used by both the 64 and 128 without having to be relocated in
memory.

As you may have guessed, I prefer writing programs that work with the 128
in 64 mode, 128-40 column mode, and the 128-80 column mode.  Obviously, the
code would work for a true 64 as well.  These modes are all available at
power up.  Although GEOS and CP/M (and some others) are operating systems
designed for the 64 and 128, they must be installed before they can be 
used.

Before getting into some actual techniques, let's examine common RAM.

@(A): Common RAM

Remember, this is the the common RAM that *I* consider to be both safe and 
usable when BASIC is resident.  There is much more available when BASIC is 
switched out, but that's another story.  There are some that would argue 
that I missed a few locations or that some of these locations are not 
really safe to use.  I'll list them and you can be the judge.

These are BASIC work areas that occupy different starting and ending
locations, yet overlap in the locations listed:

   $0024 - $0030 (36-42) - 7 bytes
   $0050 - $0053 (80-83) - 4 bytes      
   $0059 - $0060 (89-96) - 8 bytes

These are good for temporary storage from within an ML program.  I wouldn't
recommend trying to use them from BASIC, the results are unpredictable.
The rest of these locations are free and can be used from both BASIC and 
ML:
      
   $00fb - $00fe (251-254)   - 4 bytes (zero page!)
   $03fd - $03ff (1021-1023) - 3 bytes
   $07e8 - $07f7 (2024-2039) - 16 bytes
   $dbe8 - $dbff (56296-56319) - 24 bytes

More or less can be available depending upon the use of sprites, fonts, or 
bitmaps.  For the purposes here, these are more than sufficient.

@(A): Common BASIC

The use of common BASIC eliminates multiple "if" statements (which increase
the size of the BASIC program) and allows you to use the same code
regardless of whether it's BASIC 2.0 or 7.0.

Common BASIC isn't common until you determine whether you're running BASIC
2.0 or 7.0 (64 or 128 mode):

   m=abs(peek(65533)=255)

Memory location 65533 is the high byte of the hardware reset vector.  The
128 contains a 255 there, the 64 does not; therefore, m=0 translates to a
64 and m=1 translates to a 128.  For some applications, we can take the 
code a step further:

   m=abs(peek(65533)=255)+abs(peek(215)=128)

Location 215 contains the 40/80 flag for the 128.  When used like this,
the 64 will always return a 0.  For the 128, a value of 0 would indicate
40 columns and a value of 128 indicates 80 columns.  The total code would
produce m=0 indicating a 64, m=1 indicating a 128 in 40 column mode, or
m=2 indicating a 128 in 80 column mode.

If you load in an ML program at the start of the BASIC, you can use some
short code to perform the task.  To use it you would have to sys(ad) and
then peek(location).  Here it is:

           ldx #$0000 ;assume mode as 64
           lda #$fffd ;check high byte of hardware reset vector at 65533
           cmp #$00ff ;compare with 255
           bne chkend ;branch to end of routine if not equal to 255
           inx        ;increment x and assume mode as 128/40
           lda #$00d7 ;check 40/80 flag
           beq chkend ;branch to end of routine if not equal to 0
           inx        ;increment x and assume mode as 128/80
   chkend  stx  $03fd ;store mode number at 1021 (any free memory will do)
           rts

Although not necessary for this article, let's examine three different ways
to ensure the device number is 8 or higher:

   dv=peek(186):ifdv<8thendv=8

How about doing it without an "if"?  Try this:

   dv=peek(186):dv=abs((dv<8)*8+(dv>7)*dv)

In ML:

           lda  $00ba ;check the device number at 186
           cmp #$0008 ;compare it to device number 8
           bpl devend ;branch to end of routine if equal or greater than 8
           lda #$0008 ;if not equal or greater then make it 8
   devend  sta  $03fe ;as well as 1022 (or any free memory location)
           rts

Now that we know what mode we're in and have made sure the device number is
a valid one, we can code the BASIC appropriately.  We can also calculate
variables:

   n=198+m*10

In this example, I set n to equal the memory location that corresponds to
the number of characters in the keyboard buffer, 198 on the 64 and 208 on 
the 128.

@(A): Common ML

This is where anyone but an experienced ML programmer will have problems.
Unless you code without any "incode" references at all, the code is not
transportable.  My thanks to Brett Tabke for explaining it to me.

Before going any further, you have to realize that the "power up" start of
BASIC starts at one location on the 64 and another on the 128.  To make it
even harder, the pointers are at two different memory locations, decimal
43 and 44 on the 64 and decimal 45 and 46 on the 128.  For the 64, the
values contained are 1 and 8 corresponding to 2049 on the 128, the values
contained are 1 and 28 corresponding to 7169.  The high bytes at 44/46 are
also considered the page numbers.  We can calculate the start of BASIC and
the page number:

   s=43+m*2
   ip=8+m*20

Since I'm going to be siting my ML behind the BASIC program, and saving it
with the BASIC, it's important that the final product will be loaded where
it was intended.  I can code for this:

   ifpeek(s)<>1orpeek(s+1)<>ipthenpokes,1:pokes+1,ip:load"*",dv

We check the start of BASIC and if it's not correct, we correct it and then
reload the program.  The "*" tells DOS to reload the file last accessed.
This may seem like overkill, but too many programs designed to run on the
64 and 128 both seem to assume that BASIC is where it should be for the
program to run.  Of course, the routine probably won't work if you've been
working with programs that are memory intensive, in which case a reset or
power off/power on would be required anyway.

At any rate, now that we know that BASIC will be where it should be, we
need to code the starting address of the ML.  The only thing that has to
be known at this point is that the BASIC for the 64 is exactly 5120 bytes
lower than that for the 128 (at startup of course).

@(#)forth: Scott Ballantyne: Blazin' Into FORTH - An Interview
           by Jim Lawless (jimbo@sr.radiks.net)

Copyright 1996 by Jim Lawless ( jimbo@radiks.net )

@(A): Introduction

In the early 70's, Charles Moore designed one of the most powerful
computing languages known.  This language, Forth, was very different
from the traditional procedural languages.

Forth is a language which allows the programmer to change most any
facet of the language they wish ( including syntax extensions ).

Forth's rapid acceptance on 8-bit microcomputers stemmed from the
fact that it took a relatively small amount of memory to properly
implement the language.

As the 1980's were reaching their final years, Scott Ballantyne
released an implementation of Forth for the Commodore 64 known
as Blazin' Forth ( herein referred to as BForth ).

Many were surprised at how powerful BForth was.  The biggest surprise
was that Scott gave BForth away for free.  While many commercial
Forth implementations graced the market, Scott came out of nowhere
and blew them away with a superior implementation of Forth.

Scott was gracious enough to grant the following interview via
e-mail.


Q: What influenced you ( during a time when Pascal and C were making 
   big press ) to write a Forth compiler? 

A: I've always hated Pascal - the language is too restrictive to be 
   useful with all that strict typing, and the I/O primitives are a 
   disaster. I don't like languages that feel like a straight jacket, 
   I prefer spandex. I wanted a fast, interpreted language to fiddle 
   with the C64's metal, write communications programs and play with 
   the SID chip and do graphics programming, etc. I actually thought 
   about writing a C interpreter, C is fun and a great language but 
   with all the libraries you need to make it useful (stdio, IO 
   primitives etc.), I was afraid it would be too big to do anything 
   useful. The C64 disk drives were too slow to make compiling 
   reasonable and interpreters are more fun anyway, so it had to be an 
   interpreter. 

   At the same time I was thinking about writing an interpreter I was 
   trying to learn Forth. My background is mostly in Lisp, and that's 
   still my favorite language (Scheme, actually is my favorite). I 
   would have written a Lisp interpreter but I'd been there, done that 
   and I'd heard about Forth for years - robotics has always been an 
   interest of mine and Forth is used a lot for that, so I bought some 
   of the Forth programs that were available for the C64. What a rip 
   off those were! They just *crawled*, not to mention that they were 
   riddled with bugs - really horrible bugs like incorrect 
   multiplication and division routines. They also didn't have some of 
   the really clever Forth features like does>, and absolutely no 
   programmer friendly tools like a trace or watchpoint. Not to 
   mention no code to study, no extension to study, they were really 
   poor. I kept buying these cartridges hoping to find one that was 
   usable and they kept making me madder and madder, so I finally 
   decided if I wanted to learn Forth, I would have to write my own. 


Q: I assume from your references to Henry Laxen and Forth Dimensions
   that you had prior experience with Forth? 

A: Not really - as you see above. I ordered all the back issues of 
   Forth dimensions that I could, since I wanted to do things right 
   and that seemed to be the way to understand things. I got a lot of 
   documents about Forth-79, Forth-83 and etc. Halfway through the 
   writing of the Blazin' Forth, I heard about Laxen's compiler, got a 
   copy of it and I learned a lot from it. The way the block buffers 
   are implemented, in particular, are modeled on the way Laxen did 
   things. That's a very clean, very nice piece of work. I admired 
   that compiler a lot. But Blazin' Forth is a lot different. I admire 
   clean code and beautiful designs, but you always have to remember 
   the old saw: "If you make it fast and ugly, people will hate you. 
   If you make it beautiful but slow, nobody will use it." So there's 
   a tradeoff one often has to make, especially on a small machine 
   like the 64. Not to say that BForth is ugly, you understand, you 
   just wouldn't take it home to momma. 
   

Q: In building BForth, you had put together a complete Forth-83 
   implementation with snazzy extensions. What led you to make the 
   package free-for-use rather than trying to make a commercial go of 
   it? 

A: I thought about marketing it. I probably could have made quite a 
   bit from it, but I was still simmering from all the money I'd spent 
   on those awful implementations in the cartridges. Remember that 
   part of my motivation here was revenge. Also, around that time 
   Stallman had just announced the GNU project. Having been at MIT and 
   immersed in what later came to be called the hacker culture gave me 
   a desire to encourage that sort of thing in general, and 
   specifically on the 64. Why not? So I took the GNU manifesto and 
   wrote this gigantic legal document based on the manifesto and gave 
   the whole mess away for free. Besides, it's a lot more fun creating 
   something than it is selling it, and I wasn't sure I wanted to 
   spend years supporting any one piece of software, which I would 
   have felt duty bound to do if I sold the thing. There were other 
   projects I wanted to go on to. There were a lot of reasons, some 
   idealistic and some just plain selfish. 


Q: In the documentation accompanying BForth, a reference is made to a 
   version for the Commodore 128 supporting a number of features 
   including multitasking. Did this project ever see the light of day? 

A: Actually, the 64 version was multitasking originally. There wasn't 
   enough room to support that and the rest of the stuff (like the 
   sound and graphics words) so I took it out. I think it was a 
   mistake to axe the U area like I did, though. If I hadn't done 
   that, some people could have written a tasker on top of what I gave 
   them. Not a gigantic mistake, but it would have been better if I 
   left it in. Remember that the traditional Forth multitasking is 
   cooperative. Not sure I agree with that... 

   I bought a 128, actually I just sold it a couple of years ago. 
   Right around the time I was getting around to writing a Forth for 
   it the Amiga came out and just blew me away. I never got back to 
   the 128. The Amiga was great - what a shame that it was so poorly 
   marketed. I worked on the ARP project and a lot of that code made 
   it into the Amiga operating system, which was gratifying. Also, 
   Commodore did pay us for that work, although it started out as 
   another free project. I worked on that with a guy named Charly 
   Heath. We never met - I could sit across the table from Cheath 
   (that's what I called him) and never know it, all the work was done 
   over the net. We were in daily contact and Cheath was a *great* 
   programmer, also a very nice guy. It was interesting, but getting 
   close to Commodore at that particular time was not the best thing. 
   To tell you the truth it made me ill, there was a lot of ugly 
   politics and bad decision making at the time, so I lost interest in 
   doing stuff for people on the Amiga. I still have an Amiga though. 
   I wrote an interesting operating system for it based on Lisp. It's 
   like an Amiga Lisp machine, it acts a lot like the original Lisp 
   machine, if you ever saw it. I have a good chunk of a Smalltalk 
   programming system written on it too - graphics interface and 
   everything. Really cool. Every now and then I pull it out and 
   fiddle with it. I never released any of this code and then the 
   company collapsed and there went my motivation to polish it up. I 
   don't mind rough edges, but when I release something I want it to 
   be as close to perfect as possible. 


Q: There are a lot of Amigoids out there watching what VisCorp will do 
   now that they own the rights to the Amiga. Is there a chance that 
   your Lisp and Smalltalk will see the light of day for this die-hard 
   group of Amiga fanatics? 

A: I suppose it's possible. I only have a 2000 - it has a 68020 card 
   with 2 megs of memory, but I sort of feel like with the 3000-4000 
   people wouldn't be that interested in code that was developed on 
   the 2000, also the new graphics modes that are available on the 
   later machines I don't have. Maybe I'm wrong. Doing this interview 
   has got me interested in it again, I worked on the small talk stuff 
   this weekend, as a matter of fact. Who knows? 


Q: What tools did you use to develop BForth? ( A metacompiler or pure 
   assembler? ) 

A: I wrote my own assembler and linker. The assembler looked a lot 
   like Lisp, the linker was very primitive really, just ran through 
   and resolved references, it couldn't really move stuff around like 
   a real linker can. It did make a cross reference though.. The 
   assembler was actually rather nice. Some people wanted it, but I 
   never got around to polishing it up and documenting it to release 
   it. 

   I have never been taken with the Forth metacompilers, but perhaps I 
   don't understand them enough. 


Q: What sort of feedback did you receive from the general public 
   pertaining to your compiler? 

A: Well, it was great. I was amazed. I thought maybe 10 people in the 
   world would be interested in a Forth compiler. I had a Compuserve 
   account back then and it was first uploaded to the C64 forum there, 
   along with the source for the higher level words and all the 
   documentation. It was quite a lot. It took forver for the sysops to 
   make it public - nobody said anything but I think they were 
   checking around to make sure I hadn't ripped it off. I guess it was 
   a pretty unheard of thing to do, just give away a major piece of 
   software like that. Anyway, once it was released the response was 
   fantastic - it ripped across the country and I got tons of mail. 
   I've never received so much mail from people. The most satisfying 
   mail was from Forth programmers who said things like "I took my 
   Forth cartridge out in the yard and drove a knife through it". 
   Revenge. It's so sweet... 

   And people sent me presents - some guys in California figured out 
   how to make a self booting cartridge out of it and sent me a 
   Blazin' Forth self bootable cartridge. That was really nice. There 
   were even some commercial products based on it - you could do a 
   save-Forth and lock people out of the Forth system, so it just 
   looked like an application. There was a communications program, and 
   some kind of cad system. I have no idea how well they did, but the 
   programmers sent me complimentary copies. 

   Some kid at CMU wrote a VAX Forth compiler based on BForth for a 
   dissertation and sent me a tape and a printout. I kept it here for 
   a long time, but I don't own a VAX and eventually got rid of it. I 
   got BForth tshirts and of course millions and millions of 
   questions. 

   I got some hate mail too. 
   

Q: What sort of hate-mail? 

A: The sort you always get. I got some from libertarians who I had 
   offended by giving it away, I got some from people who hated Forth 
   and thought I should have written something else, I got some from 
   people who had downloaded it and couldn't make it work. I'd try to 
   help them, but sometimes it just didn't work for them. In many 
   cases I had no idea why, they couldn't tell me, just `it didn't 
   work'. I never got any mail from people who had written Forth's for 
   commercial use - I was surprised at that. 


Q: I've seen nearly constant battles on net conferences between the 
   Forth camp and the Pascal/Modula camp. Did you encounter any 
   "language bigots" in the early days of BForth? 

A: Oh sure, you always do. Frankly I think all these language wars are 
   misguided. I hate Pascal, but I don't have a problem if you use it. 
   Why should I? I've never understood that. There are languages which 
   are too brain dead to be taken seriously, but I still don't have a 
   problem if people want to use them. I think it must be either not 
   enough to do, or some kind of insecurity. 


Q: What positive feedback did you receive about BForth? 

A: People wrote tons of really useful software in it and I got copies 
   of all of it. 

   The nice thing too was that there were so few bug reports. 
   Actually, there was only one bug ever reported from Blazin' Forth, 
   and I found that myself and uploaded a patch. To tell the truth, 
   there is one other bug in that program, I discovered it years 
   later. It's actually a bug in the assembler - there was a garbage 
   line that should have triggered an error but didn't, it assembled 
   garbage. But the nature of the bug is such that it actually is only 
   triggered extremely rarely. No one has ever reported it. Hehe! 

   And this is an interesting point: I learned a lot from writing that 
   thing and one of the things I learned was the value of programmers 
   being involved in every aspect, from design to coding to writing 
   the manuals to testing. Writing the manuals not only uncovered a 
   lot of bugs as I was thinking up examples, it also suggested 
   various improvements. But the biggest applause has to go to my 
   girlfriend - we are still together, incidentally. She's the 
   greatest. She's a musician and was curious about all this computer 
   stuff, and remember that I wanted people to be able to learn Forth 
   from scratch - the documentation, everything was designed to make 
   it possible and easy to learn Forth from Brodies book, which was 
   the most common text. 

   So I gave her the Forth compiler, the documentation and the Brodie 
   book, and she taught herself Forth. She found tons of bugs, but 
   when she was done, she had learned Forth, I had a debugged system 
   and I was pretty pleased, all in all. I'm sure this is one of the 
   reason that people liked it so much - I got a lot of mail from 
   people who said "I've tried so many times to learn this language, 
   and now I have." 

   There was lots more stuff - I got pictures of people holding up 
   signs that said "We Love Blazin Forth!". It was very gratifying. 
   Much nicer than money. People were very appreciative and tried to 
   show it. 
   

Q: Would you recommend Forth as a first computer language? 

A: I think any modern computer language is a good one. Forth would be 
   good. A lot of teaching beginners has to do with language 
   independent features such as feedback and debuggers and stuff. It's 
   not very rewarding for most first timers to do !'s and @'s or write 
   'hello world' programs. Big deal. That's one reason I put the 
   turtle graphics into BForth - you can see loops and larger 
   structures, it makes sense and it's rewarding, so I'm a big 
   supporter of that sort of thing for beginning programming. I still 
   remain partial to the Lisp class of languages, so if I were 
   teaching I would probably use those for a beginner, but the same 
   comments apply to those. 

   

Q: If you could do anything differently in the development and 
   distribution of BForth, what would you do? 

A: Oh, I made some mistakes. I should have preserved the U area, like 
   I said before. Today I would probably not implement the Forth block 
   system, I'd use files instead. I never liked that, to tell the 
   truth. It made a certain sense with the 64 disk drives, and the 
   code I wrote is optimized for the rotational speed of those things, 
   but I think it leads to better programming to just store your code 
   in a file with a name. I would have added more hooks, I think I 
   would have added a 'junk' dictionary for things like defining words 
   or the assembler and editor that you could make 'go away' once you 
   were done. That would have saved a lot of memory, I think. 

   You always think about stuff like this for all your projects. 
   Software is never really finished and I could go on forever about 
   just about every program I've ever written. Even about little 
   things. For example, I *really* regret not special casing 
   horizontal and vertical lines in the graphics line drawing 
   function. A little thing, but it was a mistake and it urks me. I 
   thought about it at the time, but the compiler was getting so big, 
   but I still think it was a mistake. Just last week, I was working 
   on some medical imaging system software and I was writing a line 
   drawing function, and I special cased the horizontal and vertical 
   lines, and guess what I thought: "Shoot - I wish I'd done that with 
   that Forth compiler..." 


Q: What sort of work are you doing nowadays? 

A: Whatever interests me. I have my own company "ScotSoft Research" 
   and I do pretty interesting work for which I charge. A lot of Unix
   work, custom applications, kernel enhancements, etc. I have donated
   a lot of code to the GNU project and still admire what they do, and
   I still love to write software. For my own pleasure and improvement
   I still have lots of projects. At some point I'll finish my
   Smalltalk system for Unix computers. In a lot of ways the Amiga
   version is better - there's a lot to be said for taking over the
   machine.  Maybe I'm a control freak, but there's a real rush in
   writing something 'from the metal up'. You can't do that with a
   Unix box and expect people to use it.

   Still, I like Unix a lot. The computers I've bought for my company
   are all Suns. IBMPCs and MACs make me puke. The Amiga, as good as
   it was, would have been a better machine if it had paid more
   attention to Unix...


Q: Is Forth still something that you use on a regular basis? 

A: Nope. Haven't used Forth in years, except for the odd command at a 
   the Sun monitor prompt. That's more a reflection on the environment
   I work in these days than Forth. It's a shame that the Forth
   community has let itself become so insular - you would have Forth
   compilers on Unix machines if there had been standardized support
   for libraries and a file system. Another weakness of forth is the
   lack of 'struct' - of course that can be implemented, but it needs
   to be part of the language definition to be truly useful.

   I still think Forth is great - I look at those micromint projects
   sometimes and think it would be fun to do some of that stuff in
   Forth...

Q: Was the C64 the first home computer you owned? 

A: Sure was. The low cost + 64k memory and extra features made it an 
   inevitable addition to my household :-) 
   

Q: Describe your introduction to programming ( were you a comp-sci 
   student? ) 

A: No - they didn't really have comp-sci so to speak back then. I was 
   in math and physics and got interested in using the computers for 
   practical, number crunching work. We were supposed to use punch 
   cards and take them to the IBM mainframe to be run by the priests, 
   but I heard about the AI lab and started fooling around over there. 
   Back then the lab was very informal, there were a lot of people who 
   weren't even associated with MIT in any official way there, high 
   school kids young university students (some younger than the high 
   school kids), it was pretty open. Anyway, I got interested in 
   hacking on the PDP series, and that started taking up most of my 
   time. You learned back then by reading other peoples code, asking 
   questions and reading manuals and of course experimentation. My 
   math professors were not very approving of my interest in 
   computers, telling me it would ruin my mathematical career and 
   probably also lead to warts and blindness if I kept this up. Once 
   you wrote some programs that were useful they put you on the 
   payroll, so I made a little money, couple of bucks an hour or so. 
   

Q: In the March 1987 issue of Transactor, you published an article on 
   Blazin' Forth. I noted that you retain the copyright to the 
   article. Any chance that we could reprint it in C=Hacking? 

A: Sure. That was originally just in the C64 forum on CIS, might still 
   be there - that's how the Transactor guys heard about it. 
   

Q: I found it odd that in the very same issue of Transactor, they ran 
   an article that processing speeds of various languages for a given 
   programming problem but did not include BForth as one of the 
   languages. Did you ever type in the benchmark code to see how 
   BForth stacked up to HES Forth, SuperForth, and C64 Forth? ( Not to 
   mention the C/Pascal/BASIC compilers that were faster than any of 
   the tested Forth implementations ). 

A: I did. What's more interesting to me than the fact that BForth 
   outperformed those compilers is that a properly implement sieve in
   Forth outperformed that scrungy algorithm in 6502 assembler that
   somebody implemented. A lot of programming well is selecting
   algorithms and designing the program well, these language debates
   (higher level vs. assembler, Forth vs. C, etc. etc.) tend to
   obscure this fact, which is actually a much more interesting topic.
   At least it is to me. Which is not to say that learning different
   languages isn't good, because it is. Inevitably styles and ideas
   are imbedded into programming languages just as they are into human
   languages and some things are easier to say in 'C' or 'Forth' and
   some things aren't. Also, languages like Lisp or scheme can allow
   you the freedom to explore interesting methods of programming, such
   as message passing or delayed evaluation models which would be
   cumbersome in Forth. Once you have these concepts under your belt,
   you can use them in any language or dialect. But I think a lot of
   people are 'coders' and know languages, but there are very few
   'hackers' or 'programmers' who are in love with clever ways to
   solve problems or squeeze more cycles out of a box. That's more
   work, but it's also a lot more fun and rewarding.
   

Q: There are scores of enthusiasts who are either discovering the 
   magic of the 64/128 by picking them up inexpensively, or they are 
   using one of the emulators available for various PC/Mac/Amiga 
   platforms. What words of wisdom pertaining to BForth would you 
   import on these enthusiasts? 

A: Wisdom. That sounds so boring. Have fun, experiment, don't be 
   afraid to crash the machine or do goofy things. Don't assume I did 
   everything right either, I didn't. When you think you know enough, 
   pick a big project that interests you and start writing it. Mostly, 
   have fun. I don't know if that's the key to life, but it sure is 
   the key to writing good software. 

Thanks for the interview Scott!

How about it?  Have I made any of you curious about Forth?  Should we
start a BForth tutorial here in the pages of C=Hacking?

@(A): Trivia Questions and Answers

          The C128 Set:

Q $200) How many general purpose central processing units does a C128
        contain?

A $200) The "3 computers in one" machine only contains 2 CPUs.  The
        Z80 handles CP/M mode, while the 8502 handles both 64 and 128
        mode.  The "3" in the C128 motto threw a bunch of folks.
    	
Q $201) The Commodore 128 contains a MMU IC.  What does MMU stand for?
     	
A $201) MMU = Memory Management Unit.  Technically, the 64 contains one
        as well, but it was always referred to as the PAL or PLA in the
        64.  The 128 MMU does more than the 64 version, though.
     	
Q $202) What Commodore produced cartridge is specifically mentioned in
        the 128 PRG as being incompatible with the 128?
     	
A $202) The Commodore 64 CP/M 2.2 cartridge.  
     	
Q $203) The C128 introduces the concepts of "banks"  How many such banks
        are recognized by the C128 BASIC?
     	
A $203) 16. Bank 0 through Bank 15.
     	 
Q $204) What version is the BASIC included in the C128 in native mode?
     	
A $204) BASIC 7.0.  
     	
Q $205) Can any of the BASIC graphics commands be used on the 80 column
        screen?
     	
A $205) It depends on how you define "graphics commands".  When writing the
        question, I was thinking of commands like BOX and CIRCLE that are
        written solely for use with the 40 column screen.  However, commands
        like SCRNCLR, CHAR, and COLOR commands are considered part of the
        graphics set.  Graphics commands that draw pixels on the bitmapped
        screen will NOT work on the 80 column screen, but those that merely
        set attributes or put characters at certain locations will work.
        However, don't let this fool you into thinking the 80 column screen
        can't support graphics.  It can.
     	
Q $206) How many high-level graphics commands are available on the C128
        in C128 mode?
     	
A $206) 14 high level graphics commands are included on the 128.
     	
Q $207) In C128 mode, at what location does screen memory start?
     	
A $207) It resides in the same location as on the 64: 1024-2023 
        ($0400 - $07e7).
     	
Q $208) The 80 column IC in the 128 can display how many full character
        sets of 256 characters each at one time?
     	
A $208) 2.  While the VIC-IIe can only display 1, the VDC IC can handle
        display opf both sets simultaneously.  That means a person can
        print upper/lowercase and graphics/uppercase characters on the 
        same screen.
     	
Q $209) Many have scorned the C128's 80 column video IC.  What about this
        IC makes it so hard to use?
     	
A $209) The VIC-IIe 40 column IC maps its configuration registers and
        screen memory into the C64/C128 memory map.  The 8563 VDC IC
        does neither.  All of its registers, screen memory, and color
        memory are hidden behind two registers.  These two registers
        control access to the entire IC.  In effect, these two registers
        are the "portal" to the VDC memory map.  To modify or read a 
        VDC internal register, the programmer must place the register
        number in one lcoation and wait for the result to appear in the
        other register.
        

Q $20A) What number is the 80 column IC referenced by?
     	
A $20A) 8563
     	
Q $20B) What machine language addressing modes cannot be used with the
        80 column chip?
     	
A $20B) The manual warns against using "indirect" addressing opcodes by
        claiming their use could generate "false" bus states that confuse
        the IC.  In reality, howevr, only the indirect mode of the STA
        opcode will cause any harm.  To understand why, one must note that
        the STA ($00),y instruction executes a read of memory before doing
        its write.             	   				    
        
Q $20C) The C128 contains keyboard keys not present on the C64.  What IC
        is used to read these keys? (besides the CIA, as on the 64)
     	
A $20C) There are two answers. Aside from the ROM, the CPU, and the above 
        mentioned CIA, the VIC-IIe IC provides the extra 3 lines used to 
        scan the keyboard.  The C128 MMU IC provides the capability of 
        reading the status of the 40/80 key. (Thanks for Marko Makela
        for this info)
        	   
Q $20D) Following the introduction of the C128, a new version of was
        developed.  Name it.

A $20D) It is alternately called CP/M Plus or CP/M 3.0
     	
Q $20E) Many people refer to C128s as 16k or 64k units.  To what does this
        refer?
     	
A $20E) In question $209, we noted that the 8563 80 column IC in the C128
        has an internal memory map.  As such, the 8563 can have varying
        amounts of RAM attached to it.  Earlier C128 contained 16kB of
        this "VDC" RAM, while later variations and some third party
        products increased this to 64 kB VDC RAM.
        							     
Q $20F) According to the C128 literature, the C128 can be expanded to use
        how much memory?
     	
A $20F) 640 kB.
     	
        The C128 Developer Set
        				       
Q $210) The C128 Memory Management Unit is located at $d500 in memory.
        At what other address does a copy of the MMU registers appear?
    	
A $210) $ff00-$ff04 contains a partial mirror of the MMU registers.
	
Q $211) How many MMU registers are are identical in the two memory ranges?

A $211) 1. The Configuration Register at $d500 and $ff00
     	
Q $212) If you are writing a C128 machine langyage program and would like
        to issue a jsr to another bank of memory, what KERNAL call would
        you use?
     	
A $212) JSRFAR ($ff6e).
     		 
Q $213) How do you pass the parameters to the KERNAL call in auestion $212?
     	
A $213) You store the parameters in $0002-$0008 and issue the call.
     
Q $214) When the C128 was developed, Commodore created a very useful buffer
        printing routine in the KERNAL.  What is its common name? 
     							    
A $214) PRIMM (Print Immediate, at $ff7d).
     
Q $215) For the routine in question $214, how do you pass the string that
        you wish to print to the routine?
     	
A $215) You store the buffer, terminated with a null character immediately
        following the call.
     
Q $216) When the C128 boots, the Z80 gains control first.  It begins
        accessing memory starting at what location?
     	
A $216) $0000

        boot code?
     	
A $217) 4096 bytes.
     
Q $218) How many configuration presets can the C128 MMU handle?
     	
A $218) 4.
     
Q $219) How small of a common RAM area can be defined in the C128 MMU?
     	
A $219) Although the answer "none" is technically correct, I was looking
        for the less obvious non-zero amount, which is 1 kB of RAM.  
     
Q $21A) How large of a common RAM area can be defined in the C128 MMU?
     	
A $21A) 16 kB of RAM.
     
Q $21B) How many times does a disk drive get accessed BEFORE the C128
        finishes booting?
     	
A $21B) twice.  (Once to attempt a CP/M boot, and once to attempt a 
        C128 boot).
     
Q $21C) What key would you hold down on the C128 during bootup to
        immediately enter 64 mode?
     	
A $21C) The Commodore Key.
     
Q $21D) Name the first 4 keys on the top row of the C128 keyboard?
    	
A $21D) Escape, Tab, Alt, and Caps Lock.
     
Q $21E) On what side of the C128 case is the RESET button located?
     	
A $21E) The right side.
     
Q $21F) What is different about the C128 power supply connector compared to
        the 64 DIN power supply connector?
     	
A $21F) The connector is square in appearance, although the voltages are
        identical to the ones provided for the C64.
     
Q $220) What 3 bytes must reside on track 1, sector 0 of a disk in order
        to autoboot that disk on a C128?
     
A $220) The abovious "CBM" bytes must be present.

Q $221) Let's suppose you pick up a printer at a flea market and it says
        CBM on the decal.  However, it lacks the familiar logo and further
        investigation reveals it isn't a Commodore printer.  The printer
        was made in 1984.  What company sold the printer?
    	
A $221) Citizen Business Machines (Citizen).  I had a lady inquire about
        a printer so marked.
     
Q $222) Which company came out with the first parallel printer interface
        for the VIC-20 in the US?
     	
A $222) CardCo, Incorporated.
     
Q $223) If you boot up a 1540 disk drive and read the error channel,
        what model number is indicated in the power-up string?
     	
A $223) V170.  Possibly, this is the code number for the drive.  Dunno,
     
Q $224) Who produced the very first Commodore diskette drive?
     							    
A $224) As close as I can tell from research, a company called "Convenience
        Living" brought out the first Commodore disk drive, beating 
        Commodore's 2040 by many months.  The system was a dual drive 100 kB
        per unit single sided drive.  The company changed their name or
        sold the unit to "CompuThink" upon introduction.
     
Q $225) What company wrote the initial BASIC for the Commodore computer
        line?	
     	
A $225) Your archenemy and mine, Microsoft.  When the PET series was
        introduced, Microsoft's Gates and Paul Allen made big bucks licensing
        BASIC for small computers.  Microsoft BASIC was small and ran on
        minimal hardware, making it an ideal language to bundle with early
        machines.  Commodore modified the BASIC after 1.0 and Microsoft
        was not involved past the initial porting effort.  As an aside, it's
        rumored that Gates and Allen might have lifted the source for BASIC
        from the University computers where they attended, but who knows :-)
     
Q $226) What was the last modem Commodore produced for the 8-bit line?
     	
A $226) The 1670.
     
Q $227) Which came first, the 2040 or the 2031?
     	
A $227) The 2040.  In business, it's generally considered bad practice to
        deliver a smaller numbered model after a larger numbered one, 
        especially if the units perform the same function.  Commodore didn't
        use such logic :-)
     
Q $228) Which came first, the 4040 or the 8050?
     	  
A $228) Again, Commodore rebelled and delivered the 8050 long before the
        4040 showed up on the scene.  This time, the reason was more logical.
        The drives served two different markets and were keyed with the prefix
        number of the machines they were marketed with.  The 4040 sold with the
        40XX series, while the 8050 came with the 80XX systems.
     
Q $229) Where were VIC computers introduced first: US or Japan?
     	
A $229) Japan.  Commodore introduced the PET in the US first, but found the 
        US market "fickle", so they introduced the VIC overseas first, since
        that market was easier to penetrate.  
     
Q $22A) Which Commodore 64 model came out after the C64c and sported
        an "off-white" case?
     			   
A $22A) The C64gs (Graphics Station).  I am uncertain, but believe this to
        be a non-US machine only.
     
Q $22B) Commodore produced two "Pong" type video games.  Name one model.
     	
A $22B) CBM 2000K and 3000H models.  Both were simple machines with unknown
        processors.
     
Q $22C) What significance does the name "Gortek" have with respect to
        the VIC-20?
     	
A $22C) "Gortek and the MicroChips" were characters introduced to help people
        learn how to use the VIC-20.
     
Q $22D) What person actually developed CP/M for the C128? 
    	
A $22D) Von Ertwine
     
Q $22E) The 8563 VDC IC in the C128 was originally designed for another
        Commodore computer.  Which one?
     	
A $22E) The Z8000 machine, another machine that never saw the light of day.
     
Q $22F) Name the single bit in the status register of the 6502 that can
        be set externally.

A $22F) The Overflow (V) flag can be set via pin 38 of the 6502, the SO
        pin (Set Overflow).
     
Q $230) What control character would one send to a Commodore printer
        to start double-wide character printing?
     	
A $230) On the 1525 (and successors, like MPS 801, MPS 803, etc), chr$(14)
        was used.  A few IEEE printers also contained chr$(1), which printed
        'enhanced' double wide characters.

Q $231) What control character would one send to a Commodore 1525 printer
        to inititiate graphics mode?
    	
A $231) chr$(8)
     
Q $232) What control character would one send to a Commodore printer to
 	end double-wide character printing?
     	
A $232) On the 1525 (and successors, like the MPS 801 and 803), chr$(15) was
        used.  On the IEEE printers and the 1526/MPS 802 (a 4023 IEEE printer
        with serial bus connection, chr$(129) was used instead.
     
Q $233) How many registers does the VIC-I (6560/61) IC possess?
     	
A $233) According to Commodore, the 6560/1 IC contains 16 addressable control
        registers, which is the number we were looking for.  How many registers
        are actually used internally is anyone's guess.  We also accepted 26
        as the answer, since there are 26 differint configuration fields 
        within the 16 bytes of memory mapped I/O.
     
Q $234) How many registers does the Plus/4 TED IC have?
     							    
A $234) Multiple answers exist for this question as well.  The TED contains
        addressing to support 64 I/O registers, but only 34 are used. 
     
Q $235) We all know the 1541 stores its directory on track 18.  Where does
        the IEEE 8050/8250 stores its directory?
     	
A $235) Track 39.
     
Q $236) If a program opens a channel to tape, reads some data, and a check
        of ST AND 32 is true, what error does that indicate?
     	
A $236) checksum error.
     
Q $237) Depending on how many memory was added to a VIC-20, BASIC could
        start in one of three locations.  Name them.
     	
A $237) 1024, 4096, or 4608.
     
Q $238) Commodore's first floppy drives used what brand of mechanisms?
     	  
A $238) Shugart.
     
Q $239) If one sees a directory listing that starts with:
        "MY DISK OF STUFF,MY,2C"   What CBM drives could have wrote this
        disk?
     	
A $239) 8050 or 8250 or derivatives: 8250LP and SFD 1001.
     
Q $23A) Name a color available on the VIC-20 that is NOT available on the 64?
     			   
A $23A) Any of the following qualify:
        
        o Light Orange
        o Light Cyan
        o Light Purple
        o Light Yellow
 
        By the way, none of these colors can be used for text.
     
Q $23B) Name two CBM computer series that used a real 6551 UART to do
        serial communications.
     	
A $23B) The Plus/4, the B128, The 700 Series.  I suspect the 600 and 500
        Series as well.
     
Q $23C) On the Commodore SX-64, is drive 0 above or below the built-in
        storage bin?
     	
A $23C) It is below the storage bin.  For those who created a DX-64 (2
        drives, the standard placement is to instal Drive 1 above drive 0.
     
Q $23D) Without looking, which key is located to the direct right of the 
        semicolon ';' key on the C64?
    	
A $23D) With exception to the Swedish 64, The equals '=' sign. On Swedish
        models, the return key sits next to the ';' key.  On Swedish
	keyboards, the key placement of the rightmost 4 columns is altered.
     
Q $23E) What does drive error number 72 mean?
     	
A $23E) Disk Full or Directory Full
     
Q $23F) What was the model number of the first serial drive Commodore 
        developed?

A $23F) Technically, the 1010 was the first unit, but I have no reports
        it ever made it past prototype stage.  And I doubt it was serial.
        The 2040 would qualify, but it was parallel (IEEE 488).  Therefore,
        the VIC 1540 is the first CBM drive to fit the criteria.

Q $240) What POKE is used to disable RUN/STOP RESTORE and also scrambles
        LIST attempts on the C64?
     	
A $240) POKE 808,234.  POKE 808,237 restores everything.

Q $241) What happens if you run a program in BASIC 2.0 and it
        executes a CONT statement?
    	
A $241) The program gets caught in an endless loop.
     
Q $242) What happens if you run a program in BASIC 7.0 and it
        executes a CONT statement?
     	
A $242) UNlike in BASIC 2.0, the statement is skipped.
     
Q $243) What diference exists between generating a "beep" (Ctrl-G) on the
        C128 after RESET and after RUN/STOP RESTORE?
     	
A $243) The volume is set to a different level on a warm start than on a cold
        start.
     
Q $244) In Commodore BASIC, is anything needed after the THEN of an IF/THEN
        statement?

A $244) No.  The command following the THEN is optional.
     
Q $245) In Question $0B3, we noticed that the 64's BASIC 2.0 placed two
        spaces between the error text and the word "ERROR" in error strings.
        On what machine was this problem fixed and only one space appears?
     	
A $245) The C128.  The C128D and C65 also fixed the problem.
     
Q $246) What disk drive was introduced to be used with the Commodore 64?
     	
A $246) The Commodore 1541.  However, intially, it was called the VIC1541.
        Commodore was confusing.
     
Q $247) What upgrade to original PETs caused some machines to dISPLAY tEXT
        lIKE tHIS iNSTEAD oF dISPLAYING cORRECTLY?
     	
A $247) When early PETs were upgraded to BASIC 2.0, the character set ROM 
        had to be replaced.  The problem was that some PET boards had 28 pin
        ROM sockets, while others had 24 pin.  The new character ROM only
        came in one size, so the models with the wrong number of pins on their
        board had to go without.  Commodore had decided to flip the location
        of uppercase and lowercase characters in the ROM.  
     
Q $248) Newer Commodore 1541 drives have a multicolored "rainbow" pattern
        on the front decal.  Name the colors in order from top to bottom
        that make up the "rainbow".
     	  
A $248) Red, Dark Yellow, Light Yellow, Green, Blue.
     
Q $249) Commodore disk drives have flip flopped on drive LED color meanings
        over the years.  When the serial drives first appeared, green meant
        power and red meant access/error.  With what drive did they swap
        the meanings?
     	
A $249) The 1571 swapped meanings.  Later, the 1541-II and 1581 also used
        red for power and greeen for access, but the 1541C continued the
        alternate usage.
     
Q $24A) Most late-model CBM VIC-20 sport a DIN style power supply connector.
        However, early VIC units utilize a different connector.  How many
        pins did this early connector have?
     			   
A $24A) 2 (two).  American typically refer to the connector as a "electric
        Shaver" or "electric toaster" connector.
     
Q $24B) Although Commodore produced mainly 80 column printers, it did 
        introduce some "wide carriage" models.  How many columns did these
        printers have?
     	
A $24B) 132 columns.
     
Q $24C) What is the "nickname" for the Commodore logo?
     	
A $24C) Depending on who you ask, either "Chicken Feet", "Chicken Head", or
        "Chicken Lips".  I like the second one best.
     
Q $24D) When the Commodore 128 was introduced, a new Graphical User
        Interface was introduced to be used with it.  Name it.  (hint: not
        GEOS).
    	
A $24D) Jane.  
     
Q $24E) A stock C128 powers up showing how many bytes free?
     	
A $24E) 122365 bytes free.
     
Q $24F) Of those, how many can actually be used to store BASIC code?
    	
A $24F) Bank 0 locations $1c00 to $fbff (57344 bytes).
     
Q $250) For years, Commodore owners have purchased Commodore printers with
        model numbers like MPS801, MPS802, MPS802, and MPS1000.  What does
        'MPS' stand for?

A $250) Matrix Printer Serial.

Q $251) For the introduction of the 264 Series (Plus/4), Commodore produced
        a letter quality printer called the DPS1101.  What does 'DPS' stand
        for?
     
A $251) Daisy Print Serial

Q $252) What does CBM DOS error number 75 mean and which drive(s) does it
        appear in?
     
A $252) I was looking for "Format Error".  This error occurs on the 1581.
        However, Todd Elliott mentions this also appears on the 8250 as
	"Format Speed Error".

Q $253) What does CBM DOS error number 76 mean and which drive(s) does it
        appear in?
     
A $253) Controller Error.  It appears first on the 1581.  It implied that
        the MFM controller was not functioning correctly.

Q $254) How many characters per inch does a VIC 1515 printer print when in
        normal mode?
     
A $254) 10 cpi.

A $25B) 77

Q $25C) What dot matrix printer matches the color scheme of the CBM Plus/4?
     
A $25C) The MPS 803.

Q $25D) How many "mirrors" of the VIC-II IC registers appear in the 64 memory map?
     
A $25D) 16.  The VIC-II only contains enough addressing for 64 bytes, so 
        the registers repeat every 64 bytes.

Q $25E) Which location in C64 memory contains the 6510 Data Direction Register?
     
A $25E) Location 0.

Q $25F) What is the significance of $fffe-$ffff in 65XX CPUs?
     
A $25F) Whenever an IRQ happens, the CPU fetches the location of the routine
        that will handle the IRQ from these addresses.

Q $260) In BASIC 2.0, what happens if you try to CONT a program after a
        program has executed a STOP command?

A $260) The program is continued from the statement following the STOP
        command.

Q $261) What is Drive Error 75 mean?
     
A $261) Alert readers will note this is the same question as $252.  The error
A $252) Alert readers will note this question is a duplicate of $252.  My 
        memory if failing.  I was looking for "Format Error".  However, 
	Todd Elliott mentions this also appears on the 8250 as 
	"Format Speed Error".

Q $262) What does the Super Expander 64 command RDOT do?
     
A $262) RDOT(M) returns information for next pixel to be plotted using mode M.
        M=0    return X coordinate.
        M=1    return Y coordinate.
        M=2    return Color Source.

Q $263) Quick, what does the 6502 opcode PHP do?
     
A $263) Pushes the processor status onto the stack.

Q $264) When using the SBC opcode to perform subtraction without a borrow,
        should the carry flag be set or clear?
     
A $264) It should be set, since the carry flag is treated as "-Borrow"
        (not borrow) when doing subtraction.

Q $265) Name the all-important zero-page subroutine on the VIC and 64 that
        appears at location $73.

A $265) CHRGET.  This routine fetches the BASIC next character.  This routine
        is usually patched to allow new BASIC commands.

Q $266) How many I/O locations does the SID IC in the 64 actually use?
     		 
A $266) 29 bytes.

Q $267) How many I/O locations does the SID IC in the 64 actually show up in?
     
A $267) 1024 bytes.

Q $268) How many blocks free does a newly formatted D9090 drive report?
     	    			  		  
A $268) 29162 blocks free.  The drive contained a total of 29376 sectors,
        implying that the initial BAM and directory reserved 214 sectors.

Q $269) Name the number of sectors per track on a D9060.
     
A $269) 32 sectors per track.

Q $26A) Name the only Commodore disk drive that used neither a serial bus
        nor IEEE-488 bus hookup?
       
A $26A) I goofed on this question.  Tghere are three answers:
           The Amiga external drives.
	   The 1551 (connected via cartridge to PLus/4 or C16)
	   The External Drive for the C65 (connected via nonstandard serial
	   bus)
     
Q $26B) The Block Availability Map for the 8050 and 8250 drives starts on
        what track?

A $26B) Track 38.

Q $26C) On an 80 column PET, where does screen memory start?
     
A $26C) $8000. If you consider the B series to be PETs, then $d000 is also a
        correct answer. 

Q $26D) What CHR code can one use to scroll up on the 8032?
     
A $26D) chr$(25)

Q $26E) On the VIC-20, 0000 to 0002 were used to hold the jmp xxxx for the
        USR function.  The 6510 in the C64 took over 0000 and 0001.  Where
        did Commodore relocate the USR jump vector to on the 64?
     
A $26E) 784-786.  The relocation causes an unused byte of zero page RAM at
        $0002. 

Q $26F) The KERNAL jump table on the VIC and 64 differ by how many bytes in
        length?
     
A $26F) They are the exact same length on both machines.

Q $270) Many people lamented the demise of QuantumLink, known alternately
	as Q-Link or the 'Q'.  When did QLink oficially close?

A $270) November 1, 1994

Q $271) Name the vaporware Virtual Reality area that was to become a part of
	QLink, but was never finished/released in its original form.
     
A $271) Habitat, a role playing game designed by LucasArts (part of the
        computing talent of George Lucus of Star Wars fame).

Q $272) The QLink area mentioned in Q $271 was eventually scaled back and
	introduced on QLink as what area?
     
A $272) Club Caribe, basically a chat system.

Q $273) The Commodore Punter Protocol was devised by Mr. Punter.  What is his
	first name?
     
A $273) Steve.  Incidentally, the Punter protocol lives on in the IBM world,
        where Steve has a Punter BBS with echoes (like FIDO).

Q $274) What kind of product is the Skyles Flash! unit? (hint: most folks don't
	need one.)
     
A $274) Serial to IEEE-488 converter.  It's used to attach IEEE-488 peripherals
        (used on the PET line of computers) to a CBM serial port.

Q $275) On early revisions of the 6502, the SO pin on the IC was labeled CPS.
        What does CPS stand for?

A $275) Chuck Peddle Special....  Named after 6502 designer Chuck Peddle.  

Q $276) What Commodore system was referred to as the 'Z' Machine?
     		 
A $276) The C900 Prototype UNIX System.  Commodore never successfully marketed
        the machine, which included a Zilog Z8000 CPU (hence the name)

Q $277) (True or False).  Commodore 64 compatibility was designed into the 
	C128 from the beginning.
     
A $277) True.  Lead Designer Bil Herd, fed up after working on the ill fated
        Plus/4, spouted off to senior management about the lack of 
        compatibility killing the project.  His comments were heeded, and he
        took on the C128 with the mandate that it be compatible with the
        64.

Q $278) The 8563 VDC found in the C128 was originally designed for what CBM
	machine?
     	    			  		  
A $278) The C900 machine mentioned in $276.  

Q $279) What was the "Theme Song" of the C128 developers?
     
A $279) The live version of "Solsbury Hill" by Peter Gabriel.

Q $27A) Who developed the C128 version of CP/M?
     
A $27A) Von Ertwine.

Q $27B) How many Paddles can one connect to a Commodore 8-bit machine?

A $27B) Technically, 4 paddles can be connected, although only 2 can be read
        at any instant in time.

Q $27C) Does the B128 have joystick ports?
     
A $27C) No.  

Q $27D) Commodore file type 2 is PRG, and type 3 is USR.  What is Commodore
	file type 0?
     
A $27D) DEL or Deleted.  Very rarely used.

Q $27E) What is Commodore file type 1?
     
A $27E) The very useful SEQ file type.

Q $27F) The original VIC-20 systems had how many pins on the video port?
     
A $27F) 5 pins.  After the 64 was introduced, newer version had 8 pins, the
        same as on the 64.

Q $280) The C128 has a real Caps Lock Key, but it failed to present an
        uppercase character for what letter on the 128 keyboard?

A $280) The Q key.  This problem only exists on first revision US 128 ROM 
        units.  As such, you can easily determine if you need a ROM upgrade 
	by trying the Q key on your 128.

Q $281) What one feature made the CBM 1660 modem immensely popular with the
        phone phreaking crowd?
     
A $281) Ability to utilize the SID IC to generate touch tones and other tones
        through the phone.  This allowed the 64 to behave as a virtual "blue
	box" or "red box" and send the magic 2600 Hz tone that patched one
	into the phone system.

Q $282) What does Timothy Leary, "the father of LSD" and Commodore have
        in common?
     
A $282) Leary was a C64 user and wrote articles for a small C= magazine based
        in Oregon.  However, I accept one technically true resoponse from
	Roger Toupin Jr., who said, "Both are dead".

Q $283) At what speed do the platters in CBM D series hard drives revolve at?
     
A $283) 3600 RPM  Compare to floppies at 300 RPM.

Q $284) In question $189, we noted that COMPUTE. Changed its punctuation to
        COMPUTE! shortly after introdcution.  However, many years later, they
        changed back to their former punctuation.  When did this occur?
     
A $284) When Compute! Publicationswas purchased by the publisher of OMNI
        magazine, they changed the name back to COMPUTE. (note period.

Q $285) Tough one.  Finish the following Commodore advertising slogan:
        "Advanced Technology Through Vertical ___________"

A $285) Integration

Q $286) In what "mode" can the Commodore 64 VIC-II IC access external memory?
     		 
A $286) The UltiMax mode.  This is the only mode where the VIC-II can perform
        this feat, and is the same mode used on the ill-fated Ultimax machine.

Q $287) What Primary CPU was used in the CBM 500/600/700 series?
     
A $287) The MOS 6509.  Basically, the 6509 was a 6502 with memory locations
        0000 and 0001 used as 34bank34 registers.  Address 0000 was the 
	execution bank, while 0001 was the indirection bank..

Q $288) How much RAM can be accessed on a 500/600/700 machine?
     	    			  		  
A $288) The 500/600/700 series, as well as the B128/B256 series, can be
        expanded to 256kB internally, 704 kB externally, for a total of 960kB
	of RAM.

Q $289) When using the KERNAL call PLOT, is the upper left corner of the 
        screen 0,0 or 1,1 ?
     
A $289) 0,0 identifies the upper left corner of the screen.

Q $28A) What does PRG stand for?
     
A $28A) Well, the CBM DOS uses it as a acronym for PRoGram File, and Commodore
        calls it's technical references Programmer's Reference Guides.

Q $28B) when displaying information on the screen, what PETSCII character is
        used to turn the character color to RED?

A $28B) COde 28 ($1C) will switch the character color to red.

Q $28C) If you poke the 64 screen memory with 0, what character fills the
        screen?  (Hint: it is NOT space)
     
A $28C) The '@' character, screen code 0.  The space is screen code 32.

Q $28D) When a BASIC or ML program initializes DEVICE 2 (RS-232) for usage,
        how much memory is stolen from the top of BASIC memory for 
        buffers?
     
A $28D) 512 bytes.  256 bytes each for an input and output buffer.  That is
        why you must open the RS-232 port before defining variables.  The
	buffers are taken from TOB (Top of BASIC), which resets are variables.

Q $28E) On what 64 computer model does [SHIFT] [RUN-STOP] load a program from
        disk?
     
A $28E) The SX-64 is designed to boot from disk by default, and some suggested
        the C64GS, although I can;t verify the latter.

Q $28F) What happens if you issue NEW in a program, like:
           90 PRINT "HI"
           100 NEW
           110 GOTO 90
     
A $28F) As expected, the program prints the HI message, then erases the
        current program from memory.

          by Frank Kontros (jeno@kontr.uzhgorod.ua)

                   (C)opyright Perry M. Grodzinski, 1991

           "DataPump Plus" contra "SwiftLink, DataBlast, CommPort"

owners.

@(A)intro: Introduction

In the original "DATAPUMP" card, many have found it difficult to find the
AA4890 DC-DC converter IC necessary to build the cicuit.  In addition, new
RS-232 drivers contain a built in DC-DC converter and do not require
additional voltage sources except 5VDC. (e.g. MAX 230, 232, 235, 237). 
This  chip  needs fewer external componets than the AA4890 specified in the 
original schematic.  I decided to use the cheap MAX 232. It usually only 
costs US$1.50 - US$2.00.   There are also many other chips, such as the 
Analog Devices AD232 and the ICL232.  which provide the same functionality as 
the MAX232.  The MAX232 IC contains 2 RS232 drivers/receivers.  Note that the
MAX232A is not the same IC; it performs the same function, but requires 
additional external capacitors.  I have revised the DataPump schematic to
reflect the MAX232 usage.  See the "Hacking the Code Section for the Schematic
in GIF format (Reference: code, SubRef: dpschematic).

In addition to revising the circuit to use readily available components, two 
additional jumpers were installed:  J1 for $DE00/$DF00 (IO1/IO2) ACIA 
address selection, and J2 for IRQ/NMI selection (for use with fast IRQ
interrupt handlers, e.g. OS/A65.

Resitors R2-R4 pull up the outputs to logic high when no modem is connected.  This helps alleviate program hangups due to simlp0sitic modem initialation code.

If you intend to use this circuit on a C128 or C128D in 2MHz mode, substitue
an 8551 or 6551A ACIA for the 6551.

If you would like to utilize a clock generator instead of the 3.6864 MHz quartz crystal oscillator, connect the generator OUT to XTAL1 (6) leave XTAL2 (7) 
floating, and connect power to the generator as follows:

                         _________________________

@(e)trivia: Commodore Trivia

In The Commodore Trivia Article in Issue #14, the answer to question $1EB was 
completely wrong.  The correct question and answer appear below:

Q $1EB) What difference between the VIC-I and VIC-II causes VIC-II equipped
        systems to potentially operate slightly slower than VIC-I equipped
	systems, all other items held constant?

A $1EB) The dot clock on the VIC-I is only 4 times the processor clock.  
        That is, the VIC-I can fetch 2 bytes for each 1 byte data (8 pixels) 
        it displays, without stopping the processor.  But the VIC-II has
        narrower pixels, because the dot clock is 8 times processor clock,
        and as a result, it only can read 1 byte for each byte (8 pixels) it
        displays.  This is sufficient for fetching the character images, 
	but the processor must be stopped to fetch the character codes (and
        colours).  (Thanks to Marko Makela for this explanation)

@(#)vic: Technical Information on the VIC-20
         by Ward Shrake

@(A): Introduction

This document is a collection of pinout diagrams and technical notes, meant
to assist anyone who wishes to experiment electronically with the "obsolete"
Commodore Vic20 computer. Specifically, this document addresses the cartridge
or Memory Expansion port and related items, such as ROM & EPROM memory chips.

What kinds of things can you do with a Vic20? Well, how much imagination do
you have? The hardware isn't as limited as most of us probably remember it
being, so the question becomes largely one of what you want to do with it,
what your level of skills and knowledge may be, and so on. Here are some 
examples of things you can do ... but by no means the only things possible!

  - A reset button can be wired into the Vic20 fairly simply. This might
    be a good idea, if one plans to experiment much. The Vic20, or any
    computer, might lock up when you've told it to do something odd while
    experimenting. Simply use a momentary-contact, normally-open switch,
    wired between the RESET line and any port GND line. When you press
    the new button for a second and let go, the computer will reset. This
    is because the RESET line is active low, and your switch grounds that
    line. If you decide to do this *inside* your Vic20, remember you are
    now looking at the *back* of the port, NOT the front. Therefore, use
    the pinout diagram for a cartridge, not the port, to find the lines.
    Radio Shack switch part number 275-1547 or equivalent will work fine.
    
  - Make your own EPROM-based plug-in cartridges, in standard memory sizes.
    The "stock" Vic20 supports up to 32k of memory, in banks of 8k each. The 
    first banks (#1, 2, 3) are contiguous memory, and can be RAM or ROM at
    your choice. The next bank is actually a ROM operating system chip, so
    that's the end of contiguous memory. However, the bank after that (#5)
    is another usable bank. It can be RAM or ROM; it is usually ROM, but can
    be RAM with one restriction; BASIC can't "see" it as easily usable. (See
    the pinout below, for more information on memory banking on the Vic20.)
    
  - Archive existing ROM or EPROM cartridges to disk or tape, to allow them
    to be run from within a RAM expander. Most commercial cartridges were
    8k in memory size, with a small amount having been 4k or 16k of memory.

  - Modify an existing RAM expander, to move one 8k bank of RAM into the
    upper memory area, in "block 5". ($A000 hex, for all you ML junkies.)
    This is not anywhere near as hard as it sounds ... and if you want to
    play archived game cartridges as "images" in RAM, it is necessary. To
    do it, just (A) open your RAM expander's plastic casing, (B) see if you
    have a bank of DIP switches already installed, and (C) if you do, just
    flip the left-most switch "on", while turning the other 3 all "off". 
    (Note that this assumes you are using an 8K expander; if you are using a 
    16K expander you need to be aware that there are two side-by-side groups
    of four switches each; the left half controls the upper 8k, and right one
    controls the lower 8k bank.)
    
  - If you want to do the RAM expander modification mentioned above, but you
    find you do not have DIP switches already installed, you can do one of
    two things. (A) you can install new switches yourself, or (B) you can do
    an easier and more permanent modification, by putting a blob of solder
    across the two left-most half-circles on the PC board, and making sure
    there are no other half-circles in that 8k bank which are joined in the
    middle by a straight line or another blob of solder. If you've ever seen
    disk drive device number modifications, its the same basic thing here.
    (But if all this sounds too complicated, let someone do the mod for you.)

  - If you find you now have a RAM cart that has a row of DIP switches to
    control where its memory will be "seen", and that cart has a fully 
    plastic (not metal) label, you can now consider cutting a rectangular
    hole in the plastic case to allow external switch-changing. This is so 
    you don't have to open the case every time you want to make a memory 
    bank change. (The metal labeled carts are harder to cut, obviously, so
    you might consider swapping guts with another cart casing, if you like.)

    The hole needed is as follows ... but note that I'm referring to the edge
    of the cartridge's LABEL area, not the outer edges of the plastic casing.
    Put some masking tape over the label (to preserve it) and write on it, to
    mark where the hole must go. The bottom edge of the hole is 5/16ths of an
    inch above the bottom edge of the label. The top edge is 1/2 inch above
    that. There should be about 1.75 inches left, from there to the top of the
    label area. The sides of the hole are harder to measure, as you'll note
    there is some subtle inward tapering of the casing and label area, to
    allow some rocking motion while inserting/removing carts from the Vic20.
    Measure from the exact left corner, inward 2 and 1/8th inches in. This is
    the left edge of the hole. Measuring from the exact right corner of the
    label, come in 1 and 15/16ths inch. The hole should be roughly 7/8ths of
    an inch wide. As with any hole-cutting project, start out smaller than
    the finished hole is supposed to be, and move outward carefully. A "hot
    knife" or dremel plastic cutting wheel will do this job fast and neat.

  - It is possible to make your RAM cartridge "look like" ROM memory, at the
    flip of a switch. This used to be a popular feature of various companies
    cartridge expansion port chassis', to allow archival images of programs
    to run in RAM, even if they are protected and would normally over-write 
    themselves if they were found to be running from within RAM memory.
  
  - Make your own plug-in cartridges, using bank-switching techniques, that
    are much larger than the standard 4 banks of 8 kilobytes each. I just saw
    a posting on Usenet, that referred to someone's having made a cartridge
    that used 192K of EPROM memory, along with 8k of RAM memory. (So much for
    the memory limitations of the past!)

  - Besides creating new things from scratch, you can also modify existing
    ones. There is nothing that says that a hardware project has to be one
    made from scratch! One beginner-type electronics project: the RAM carts 
    made by Commodore came in 8K or 16K variations. But if you open one up, 
    you'll quickly see that the PC boards are identical in both versions. 
    The 8k RAM cart is just a half-populated 16k board! I have not done it 
    myself (as I have 16k and 32k expanders already), but adding the extra 
    8K looks easy enough, if one had the right parts and the need to do it.

  - It seems entirely feasible to make a "fastload" type of cartridge for the
    Vic20 ... that is, one that "disappears" part of the time, leaving memory
    in a non-expanded state. One possible application example might be to, as
    I said, make a "fastload" type of cartridge; in fact, years ago at least
    two tape accelerator carts DID once exist (Arrow, and Vic Rabbit). 
    
  - Other possible uses for a cart like this might be to make a cart similar 
    to the "Game Genie". In other words, where cart images loaded into RAM 
    memory are modified byte-by-byte, in some pre-calculated ways, to make
    immortal or "cheat" versions of certain games. Or best case scenario,
    all cartridge based games! Imagine adding level selects to 15-year old
    games? It may sound silly at first, but what a hacking trick to pull off!

  - Memory dumping carts are one other possibility ... by that I mean carts   
    similar to the "Snapshot" series, "Icepick" or whatever. These would be
    very useful for examining memory usage, testing RAM carts, etc, etc.

  - "Multi-carts" are also possible. In other words, many images of cartridge
    based software programs can be placed into one or more very large EPROM
    chips, in one cartridge casing. Modern memory sizes all look huge, when
    compared to the miniscule memory sizes of the past. One example: a 28-pin
    chip exists that is *almost* a direct pin-for-pin replacement for a 24-
    pin EPROM memory chip. So, its *almost* trivial to make an 8k cartridge 
    be a collection of 8 x 8k games, or 4 x 16k games. Much, much larger
    chip sizes exist now, which would allow a hundred or more games in one
    cartridge casing. Of course, that's no longer easy, let alone trivial,
    but it can be done. It has been done already, with other gaming systems,
    in fact. (See the pinouts and notes below, for some get-started info.)

  - If you did make a multicart, one easy way to control all the extra lines
    needed for bank-selection and addressing, would be to use the modem port
    lines, with a cable from there into the cartridge. Sounds silly, perhaps,
    but there are already 8 user-addressable lines there, for input and for
    output, so why get fancier than you need to? This port should seem very
    familiar to C64 users, as there are a lot of similarities there. To use
    the port, as on the C64, takes only two POKE's, even from within BASIC!

  - Battery-backed carts used to exist, years ago. Those should not be too
    hard to make again. In fact, some RAM carts have such large capacitors
    inside them, that once you load a program up and turn it off, it takes 
    quite some time to get RAM to clear! (I thought I toasted one of my Vic's
    one day, after a soldering session. But I figured out what was wrong; 
    all it takes to solve the problem is to wait longer when power cycling.)
  
  - You tell me? There has to be more ways to use this part of the Vic20....

So with all that said, I'm going to launch right into the technical specs and
such, and let you play to your hearts content! I'd love to see an article in
a later issue of C= Hacking, that put this information to use, and showed us
all exactly how you did it, step-by-step. Go for it!

Below is a pinout diagram of a standard Vic20 cartridge, seen facing its card
edge connector. Please note that this is NOT the pinout of the port it plugs
into, which is shown above. The two pinouts are exact opposites, because you
are facing the port head-on as is, but you have to flip a cartridge around
180 degrees to be able to look at it head-on, facing its card edge connector.

 See the notes below for some tips on using this as a replacement memory
 chip, on a modified cartridge body, for experimentation purposes. Note
 that there are differences between it and the standard Vic20 chip below,
 that will have to be accounted for before it can be wired to the boards.
 However, a rare few Commodore-made carts came wired from the factory to
 use standard 2764 EPROM chips ... if you can find one, it would be easier
 to experiment with. (And I do mean rare; I have only seen two, myself!)
 These special carts are in brown plastic cases, with metal labels that
 have no name printed on them. Instead, there is a metallic sticker stuck
 on it, with the name of the cartridge. Apparently, limited edition carts.
 Also, a few later HES carts I've seen also came with EPROMs and sockets.
 But be careful, as various early carts sometimes used 2 banks of 4k each!

This pinout was derived from a Vic20 schematic, found in the book the
"Vic20 Programmer's Reference Guide". (Great book!) Please note that while
this is an 8k-by-8-bit Commodore memory chip (its actually the Kernal chip,
located at $E000-$FFFF), and that while it could normally be assumed safely
that a company would standardize and use the same chips in their cartridges
that they used in their computer's motherboards, this is Commodore we're
talking about. A bit of paranoia might be in order. Having said that, I'll
note that as of this writing, the author has not compared this diagram and
an actual memory chip from a Commodore-produced Vic20 cartridge. 'Nuff said!


Information for the diagrams above was taken from the Vic20 reference book 
"The Vic Revealed" by Nick Hampshire, 1982, Hayden Book Co, Inc. That info 
was verified by checking it against information found in the "Vic20 
Programmer's Reference Guide," 1982, by Commodore Business Machines, Inc. 
and Howard W. Sams & Company, Inc. Other references were checked as noted.


@(A)notes: Assorted notes on the diagrams above, and some related subjects.

You are looking at the cart pinout as if you were holding an unopened
cartridge, label-side up (or right, in these diagrams) with the gold fingers 
pointing at you. If you are looking at a bare circuit board once it has been 
taken out of its outer plastic case, the chip is on top (or right, as shown 
here) again with the gold fingers facing you. (The diagrams were drawn 
sideways, as the ASCII drawings are somewhat clearer this way, believe it or 
not. There is less confusion this way over which pin is which. Horizontally, 
each name takes up more space.)

A perhaps useful experimenter's tip: If you plan to take the circuit board 
out of the cartridge case, then remove the ROM chip(s) from the circuit board, 
mark the two sides of the board first, or you may no longer be able to tell 
which is the top, and which is the bottom! This is especially true if one is 
removing chips to install sockets. (Any magic marker will do; just write 
"Bottom" on the "green stuff". Do not write on any exposed metal surfaces.

For experimenting purposes, it might be handy to find a cartridge you no 
longer care about, desolder the existing ROM chip from the circuit board 
inside the cartridge and install an IC socket to make it easier to change 
chips, later. However, note two things about this. One, the socket makes the 
whole thing taller, and it may no longer fit into a standard case. You can 
either (carefully!) use the new circuit board without using its outer case, 
at least for in-house testing, or you may be able to cut a "window" in the 
top of the case to clear it all. Second, some cartridges don't use standard 
IC ROM's, so try another cartridge, until you find one that does use a 
standard DIP package. (Some carts are more "rare" than others; try to use a
cartridge that isn't super-rare, when cutting and hacking them up, please!)

On all the Vic20 carts the author has opened and seen so far, the ROM chip 
inside has 24-pins. Standard replacement EPROM's have 28-pins. This creates 
problems, but not insurmountable ones. It is a bit of a nuisance, but the 
dedicated experimenter can modify a 24-pin circuit board, to accept any 28-
pin standard EPROM, such as the 2764 package. If one did not want the hassle 
of doing this, one other method exists to be able to put your own 8K eprom 
chips inside; however, it is not cheap. Motorola makes an 8K EPROM that is 
completely compatible with Commodore's "standard" 24-pin ROM chips. It even 
works as a direct pin-for-pin replacement for the 8K Kernal and Basic ROM's 
inside your Vic20 or C64; the author has replaced both types in the past.
The part number for this EPROM is MCM 68764. It was about $18.00 each. (Yes, 
it is programmable via the C64's "Promenade" eprom burner too!) I think I got 
my 68764 years ago, from Jameco Electronics; try them. A 2764 adapter circuit 
board can be made to adapt the differences in 24-to-28 pin sockets, but it 
will likely be too tall to fit inside. This Motorola chip may be somewhat hard
to find; I've been told it is no longer being made. (Try the I'net, for one.)

The memory area located at $A000-BFFF ("Block 5") is normally considered to 
be a ROM-only block of memory. RAM can be mapped into that space if you 
modify the cartridge's internal switches/jumpers, to redirect a standard RAM 
cartridge to load higher up in memory. However, BASIC cannot normally access 
that area, as it is meant to be for ROM's only. This is important, if one 
wishes to archive an 8K autostart ROM cartridge (normally located in block 5)
and run the resulting ROM image from within RAM. It can be done, but you have 
to modify a standard 8K RAM cartridge to do it. (Ground "BLK 5", and cut any 
trace or jumper that tells the cart to load into a different area.)

Note also that some carts may be copy-protected, and will not run in RAM 
without modification or "training," to alter the copy protection. Some carts
that have copy protection coded into them, try to overwrite themselves. Some
carts apparently use a more sophisticated timing-based approach; they know if
you have just turned the machine on, or if you've been loading an image up. A
few carts use very subtle methods to protect themselves from being archived.

Trying to relocate a machine language program from the memory area where it 
was written, and intended to be, and to have it actually work afterwards, is 
not advised. It will not work! At least, not without doing so many difficult
modifications to the machine language object code that you may as well just 
start over and reprogram it all from scratch. For most people, don't bother 
trying. To me, the idea is to get the real actual code as written, anyway.

Similar problems confront the user who wishes to archive a tape or a diskette-
based original. Trying to make a cartridge out of it, isn't worth the huge 
headaches. You are better off, in this case, trying to archive tape-based 
programs to floppy disk (which will still require a little modification, but 
not as much), and floppies to floppies. But if you can do it, more power...

And last but not least: on all the NTSC Vic20 motherboards I looked at (4 or 
5), the BASIC memory chip is labeled "UE11", while the Kernal chip is labeled 
as "UE12". My PAL schematic lists these two as UD5 and UD6, respectively. The 
Basic memory map area is at $C000-DFFF. Kernal is at $E000-FFFF. The only 
other 24-pin chip is the Character Generator; its 4K, not 8K.

@(#)code: Hacking the Code

Being a technical, developer oriented magazine, some articles featured
in C=H include executables or other binary files as part of the article. 
All such binary files are included on the soft copy of this issue in this
section.  In an effort to retain the integrity of such binary files through
distribution over various computer networks, the binaries in this section 
have been encoded using the UUcode format, a popular Internet 
binary-to-readable text encoding method. In order to execute or otherwise
utilize these binary files, one must feed this section of the magazine
to a UUdecoding application.  Typical examples include UUXFER for the 64,
uudecode on the ACE OS for the 64 and 128, and uudecode on most UNIX OS 
machines.  Some encoders can decode multiple files, while others will
require the user to manually split this section into individual pieces
prior to decoding.

In addition to this section, there are other ways to retrieve the
binary files featured in this issue.  For those with World Wide Web
access, the files are available on the Commodore Hacking Web Site at
http://www.jbrain.com/chacking/ as well as on our ftp site at
ftp://ftp.jbrain.com/pub/cbm/mags/c=hacking/

For those with electronic mail access only, the Commodore Hacking
MAILSERV server also contains a copy of these files.  To retrieve a 
copy of "dim4.lnx", send the following email message:

To: ftpmail@mail.jbrain.com
Subject: FTPMAIL
Body of Message:

open
cd /pub/cbm/mags/c=hacking/14/
bin
send dim4.lnx
help
quit

For some articles published in Commodore, the author or authors may also
have other methods for accessing files mentioned in the article.  These
methods are described in the respective article.

Commodore Hacking always attempts to provide the reader with as many
options as possible to retrieve uncorrupted binary files.  Although none
of these above methods is foolproof, the added redundancy helps overcome
any shortcomings.
				       
WARNING:  The UUCode format translates files from binary to ASCII, not
PETSCII.  Therefore, either decode this section before downloading this
section to a PETSCII mode computer system, or download this section without
translation to PETSCII.  Some decoder programs can handle PETSCII converted
UUCode files, but the practice is not recommended because conversion is
typically done in a telecommunications program and accuracy in
translation cannot be guaranteed.
