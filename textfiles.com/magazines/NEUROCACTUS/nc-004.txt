   Identification : Holden Commodore
   Body Type      : VP

   Well Im sure we have all seen people busted by undercover cop cars  so
   I have decided to write a INFO phile on how to spot them (Thats before
   they bust your arse!)

   From Behind: * The  back  end  of  the  Car  looks  lower  than  usual
                  Commodores.
                * Make sure it is a Commodore as a few other makes of the
                  cars have the same outer body ie Berlina's.
                * Contrary to popular belief,  Not  all  undercover  cars
                  have areils located on the rear window and it  was  the
                  older cars from a few years ago that  had ariels on the
                  roof.

   From Sideon: * The rear tyre arch is Flat (not round like most cars)
                * The rear wheel itself goes above the wheel arch.
                * The tyres wont have wheel covers of any sort  on  them.
                  Usualy the rim and bolts are painted black.

   From Front : * The front grill looks almost non existant.

   Other Info : * There is noway to pick a cop car by its  licence  plate
                  (Unless you a master list of plates I guess)
                * Cop cars dont have 'EXTRAS' on them EG No rear spoilers
                  , no pin striping, no roo bar, no front spot lights and
                  usually no or very light tint.
                * Car rego sticker has either June(6)  or December(12) on
                  it as they re-rego  each car  for 6  months.  (Hard  to
                  check unless parked)
                * Generally there is two people in the car
                * Most undercover cars have  Officers in  uniform  inside
                  the cars so pull alongside and have a look.
                * Cop cars arnt allowed to Advertise other companys so
                  they wont have bumper stickers of any sort.

   Cast     : Ripmax, FRaCTaL iNSaNiTY, uNIQUE-oNE and some extras.
   Props    : Lots of telecom wire, telecom hex wrench, dildo key, two
              phones.
   Apologys : Frac's Beige Box (lost somewhere in transit)

    6:47.12pm  Ripmax calls FRaC and organises to meet at about 7:15...

    It was now 9:15pm. As late as it was, FRaC figured Ripmax may still be
    waiting around at a laser amusment centre for some strange reason. There
    was some strange reason as Ripmax was still hanging around and in a
    rather unpleasant mood due to FRaC's punctuality.

    9:38.12pm The decision is made to do some trashing and pitting.

    9:49.43pm The guys finally get moving and head off down the freeway
    to get to Ripmax's house in neurocactus. Well once stocked up, fed, and
    told off for making too much noise we headed off down the freeway again
    back into Australia to get some shit done...

    10:14.54pm An emergency operator phone is spotted sitting innocently at
    the side of the freeway. FRaC starts having fits and wants to steal it.
    He didnt steal it (bloody traffic he says).

    10:53.12pm Ripmax thinks it may be a good idea to get organised about now
    as alot of fuel is being wasted driving around with the hardcore techno
    blaring away.

    10:59.32pm Unique-one finds a pit in a deserted area. As we approached it
    Ripmax began to wonder if we were doing the right thing and before he
    could say anything the pit lid was removed and FRaC was removing oodles
    of wire from the pit the telecom were nice enough to pre coil for us.

    <Approx 2 to 3 hours of finding pits and getting wire. Result :about 500m
    of 4 core telecom wire>

    2:02.19am A unanimous decision is made to stop driving and start beige
    boxing. The decision was made will in view of a large 2*2 steel pit.

    2:05.27am uNIQUE-oNE opens one of the four steel lids of the pit and FRaC
    peers down with the aid of a torch. "F@&#&#&$",says FRaC as he observes
    enormous internal size of the pit. It was about 1 metre deep and about
    1.5 metres long and 2 metres wide. Besides the large optical trunk which
    was bolted securely (doh) to one of the cold concrete sides there were
    large tributry wires eventually spitting down into the customer lines.

    2:10.34am After a bit of discussion in someones unfinished house, FRaC
    and Ripmax accepted the job of getting in the pit and working on all
    the 'inards'.

    2:13.42 With equptment in hand and pocket and wire round shoulder, the
    misfits entered the pit.

    <Ripmax and FRaC are out of view and POV changes to FRaC>

    "hey Ripmax that just about does it, ive put out cable on this
    line here.", says FRaC

    "okay is it connected correctly? like is it live?", asks Ripmax

    "dunno, im not putting my tongue on the damn wires...",snarls FRaC

    <misfits are once again in view after exiting the pit and laying
    their new phone line across the ground about 300m towards the car>

    2:35.21am "Shit its dead", FRaC shouts. He was correct... the customer
    line he had installed was not connected yet...

    2:39.43 The two super criminals ran towards the pit to 'teach telecom
    a lesson of respect' and they dived into the pit and began breaking all
    the wires in site untill the inside of the pit looked like the tip.

    3:01.23 The night ends as the decision is made to start making the journey
    home. Ripmax was not too happy at the thought of having to drop 3 people
    off to different parts of the city and thought of the time required to
    do all this bloody driving.

   CONCLUSIONS: .oO Dont let Unique-1 be a navigator... you get lost
                .oO have your cable set up for beiging... its hard to
                    strip cable and join wires in the dark
                .oO Dont drop dildo lids on the freeway, they may
                    bounce back and hit the car
                .oO Scourge once said that teenagers go berserk over
                    the holidays... I have to double that one...

   Well Im sure we all wish we knew a certain payphone number so  that a
   friend could call us back or If you didnt want to give out  your real
   number to someone then you could arrange to get them  call  you  on a
   payphone. Well in the release by TEN (included at  the Bottom)  there
   wasnt any West Australian numbers so I have decided to go and collect
   some new ones for each issue.

   Okay all you peoples in short supply of money, carding is still one of
   the easiest and highest returning ways of increasing the thinkness of
   your wallet and not to mention the thickness of your police file if
   you get caught... Okay heres some info for Perth. 1. Almost all of the
   credit card accepting (non chinese) shops have been done and are now
   wary to a small degree. Few computer shops will leave untorn carbons
   in the bin anymore also. A few select computer shops have been hit for
   very large amounts and many times and they are VERY wary of orders like
   64Mb of Ram from some 14 year old dork. Car stereo shops are still a
   good choice to card from with carbons being readily available and few
   stores being hit so far which leaves them looking like the next wave
   of targets due to their unwaryness... Home hi-fi shops are a very good
   idea also due to the low amount shops which have been ripped off..
   Almost all of the home hi-fi stores i visited while trashing one night
   had carbons in the bins, not even hidden or anything...

   Some tips in general .oO Dont keep the shit that can be traced... sell
                            the shit straight away before it becomes
                            'illegal' and use the cash to buy legal stuff.
                        .oO Sports stores are the absolute best target.
                            Few serial numbered items, very little know
                            ledge of the carding problem and inadiquite
                            staff training (some of the staff dont ask
                            any details of your card except the number
                            and hence dont even check its limit)

   Next issue: Review of some shops in the perth and melbourne metro
   areas detailing thier staff training levels, carbon availability,
   waryness and ease of sale of the respective goods.

     Melbourne District Traffic Dept.   900 - 999



The above holds true for units with *station identifiers*.

     For 200 & 300 units, the last two figures indicate the starting time of
     the unit's shift,

          eg. Nunawading 303 = Nunawading van on 3 pm - 11 pm shift. (12 hr
          clock.)


     A 5 as the middle digit of the numeric identifier indicates a sergeant.
     A 6 as the middle digit of the numeric identifier indicates a senior
     sergeant,

          eg. Glen Waverley 253 = Glen Waverley afternoon shift with sergeant
          on board.

          (N.B. The Dog Squad are not included in this system.)


Several variations in numeric identifier appear in Departmental callsigns.


Units attached to the Community Policing Squad may use a divisional callsign
with a 400 series, eg. BLACKBURN 463, (shift system applies,) or a
departmental callsign, eg. OPERATIONS 222 (shift system not applicable).

All Operations Department units employ the 400 callsign series. These are NOT
CRIME CARS!! Canine units are the only exception to this rule - see below.

     The Air Wing uses a 400 callsign series:

       40* = Ground vehicles
       41* = Fixed wing aircraft
       47* = Rotary wing aircraft - Squirrels
       49* = Rotary wing aircraft - Dauphins

               eg. AIR 402, (filling truck,) AIR 492, (helicopter,) etc..

     N.B.      [1] The air ambulance identifies on any service as AIR 495.
               [2] Rotary wing aircraft from other services identify with
               <service> 499, eg. PENINSULA 499 (Sth. Pen. Rescue Squad).

                    Aircraft Registration:   AIR 490/1      VH-PVF
                                             AIR 492/3      VH-PVK
                                             AIR 495        VH-PVA
                                             AIR 474        VH-PVM

               Operators can determine available aircraft from a backlit sign
               facing the consoles from the top end of D24.

     The Dog Squad use the 200 series, but do not follow the divisional shift
     system.

               eg. CANINE 278, CANINE 256, etc.; these are all dog squad
               units.



All Services Department may use any of the numeric callsign series.

     Radio Electronics Division TEST Callsign is COMMUNICATIONS 677.
     Mobile canteen is SERVICES 200, also known as CUP 'A' TEA 200.

     The Quick Response Vehicle (Communications) may also be known as the
     'QRV'. The callsign of this vehicle is VKC6. It is housed at Russell
     St..

(*) Note that the Special Operations Group use "SECURITY" identifiers when
operating 'clear', ie. non-DVP. When Public Security Groups are not allocated
major incident colour codes, they may also be found using SECURITY identifiers,
eg. on UHF channel 23 in Melbourne.

   "First officer's log, stardate 302.1002. The R2 is heading towards a
   volley of boxes on the 'BHP steel hotline' star system. Im worried a
   bout the captains state of mind for this mission. He appears  to  be
   very happy and he is leaving a trail of used  cream  whipping  bulbs
   all over the floor of the bridge..."

   Aboard the R2
   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
   "Captain, box number 1008 is hailing us", said Commander FRaC as he
   searches for a phone handset"
   "On-speaker Commander" replyed Captain Ripmax...
   "You have reached the voice mail box of The Sydney Haymarket System
   test box number one" says the obnoxious female voice protruding from
   the speakers in the door of the R2"
   "Hey thats a sysadmin box. Hey shit ive found the password its that
   silly default one!", yells Officer Blade cunningly.
   "Good work Officer Blade",grunted Captain Ripmax
   "Okay change the password and delete that stupid voice signature",
   screamed Commander FRaC
   "Changed sir", replyed Ensign Grudge after fiddling with knobs and
   dials on the arcaic beige box he had plugged into the socket.
   "Oh My GOD!", said Captain Ripmax in awe as box 1008 proceeded to
   initialise itself and restore itself to its former condition
   "Captain, the box has returned to normal. Its incredible!",yelled
   Officer Blade
   "It must be a new life form of some kind. A box that can regenerate
   itself after a hacking! This is terrible", sighed an obviously
   dissapointed Commander FRaC
   "Okay disengage the R2 before we sustain too much damage"
   "Disengaging sir",replyed Officer Blade

   Aboard the Missing Link

   "We have a problem here Detective, some bandits have discovered our
   new anti-hack mailbox and are loitering around on the system!",said
   Neil Campbell
   "Find them with our new CLI! It only took 8 hours to trace a call last
   Week when that old bat had a heart attack", replyed Detective Sergeant
   Ken Day
   "I cant find them sir, they appear to be cloaking in box 4234", said
   the now infuriated Neil Campbell
   "What? Weve had complaints about that box, apparently some hoods are
   using it for an info line and its got recordings of my stoopid voice
   on it...", sighed a personally insulted Ken Day
   "Yes theyve left the system"
   "Im initializing the CLI now"
   "Yes i have the number..."
   "SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT its a bloody pay phone out the front of zone 3 on
   the planet NeuroCactus"
   "Damn, we'll catch that R2 one of these days... its not a game! its a
   criminal act!", said Ken Day in a well over used voice.

   Aboard the courier ship "(F)lowers (B)y (I)rene"

    "Damn we cant seem to amplify the signal enough but someone is defina
    tely putting fuel in the R2!", said a tired and overworked FBI officer
    "Yeah well i wonder what they are up to tonight, they seem to be
    visiting quite a few voice mail box planets which is unusual!", said
    a ridiculous looking FBI junior officer
    "Maybe we should put taps on thier phone lines...", said another
    FBI officer with remarkable resemblence to Ken...
    "Nah were not allowed to do that B-)", said the senior officer

    Back on Board the R2

    "Captains log stardate 303.0037. After almost being assimilated
    by the missing link we have retreated to the scene info line box
    to refuel and recuperate and to gather some clues together on the
    dissappearance of some NeuroCactus members and nc-003.txt"

    "Captain, we have found a huge pointer that leads us to beleive that
    a large portion of nc-003.txt may be in the Chiba city galaxy!", said
    Ensign Grudge
    "Okay plot a course for Chiba City. Bearing +61-X-XXX-XXXX.", called
    Captain Ripmax
    "Warp 9, Engage"
    <"The number you have called has been disconnected or has been changed.
    Please check the number before calling again. You have not been charged
    for this call">
    "Damn someone forgot to pay the phone bill to the ferengis...", sighed
    Captain Ripmax
    Showing his loyalty to the Chiba city galaxy, Commander FRaC saluted and
    began mumbleing, "What are we going to do? We cant find nc-003.txt and we
    cant find some of our crew... i fear for the safety of Admiral T Pick and
    his men from the old R2."
    "Not to worry Commander, we will find them, and we will find nc-003.txt
    and one day it will sit on bbs's all over the galaxy as a reminder of
    when NeuroCactus nearly died"
