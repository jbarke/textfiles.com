   Again we welcome you all to Neurocactus Bulletin Number 8.  Well this
   issue was planned for release at christmas 96 but alas we have failed
   due to over partying and all the rest of the things  you do  over the
   festive season or three. I hope you all had a few good ones.

   Special thanks to all those who have used the NC  account and sent in
   mail to me. All been good so far. No one has left  non-anonymous mail
   to publish, but we encourage you to do so.  You can also send us mail
   via our EMAIL Addreses published at the bottom of the issue.

   News from the Fed market is analogue phone fraud! Fancy that. We have
   some interesting tit-bits further into the magazine.As always it pays
   to stay one step ahead of the fedz by having storys worked out and as
   always, *DONT* take big risks and NEVER abuse a good  thing  for  too
   long. Its better in the long run,  coz when  you get out of the scene
   you dont want a  nice  criminal  record to show to a future employer.

   Our planned editor for this issue Data King has been sacked after not
   even getting his first issue out! 8-) As usual its the boys from WA
   to get arse kicking equipment out and jump on some heads.Anyway enjoy
   this release because its probably our last (see my texts below).

   Special thanks to Wizard and ex-member Dataphobia for articles.

   ADMIRALS LOG : Stardate 87242860/5060600918 (this looks familiar!)

   Our links to the hax0r networks have been taken out by a blast from a
   alien beam. Some new technology spacetime worm has attempted to take
   control of our systems. Unfortunately the 8800MOT Interstellar transmitter
   has been disabled. We are currently trashing some new sectors in hope
   of gaining the information required to get us operational once more.

   ABOARD THE LSD

   "Captain FraC, any sign of the information yet?" asked Admiral Ripmax.

   "Were in the final phase of scanning now," exclaimed Captain FraC,

   "Ensign Dataking how is the scan of the telco sector going?"

   "Captain there is a shit load of info in here, we could be scanning
   paper work for the next month, If the telco had any method of organizing
   anything we may have a time reference to work on"

   "We dont have a month Ensign, Its time to call in some help here,"
   said Captain Frac.

   "Who do you suggest?," asked Admiral Ripmax.

   "A friend of mine from the Academy Days, Commander MalicE, I'll get him
   here within the next few hours"

   <A Few hours later through Random wormhole>

   "Hey, Roxering and stuff guys, wassup" says MalicE

   "We've got a 2-Bit Space-time network worm busting up our communic-
   ations. We blocked its attempts to get at our other systems but we cant
   get the infos to get rid of the thing", said Admiral Ripmax

   "I can bustup any two bit space-worms " randomly commented from MalicE
   as he jumps on a console. "This is the ZidZil worm. I've seen this before.
   any close ships we can transmit this to?"

   "Scanning for vessels in proximty to us," exclaimed ensign Dataking.
   "Missing Link is as usual trying to track us, location on monitors now"

   20 seconds later the Forward Device Array gets cranking and the
   Space-time network worm is beamed out from the LSD... towards the
   Missing Link.

   "Suck on this Fedz, ya dumb wannerbees" laughs MalicE.

   "Catcha l8rs, dudez" says MalicE before he begins beam out. Moments
   later the Shuttle craft C7 decloaks and jumps off at Warp 69.

   ABOARD THE MISSING LINK

   "So Ken what are we up to today?" grunted Neil Cambell

   "Perhaps we can tune into some intergalaxy sex lines again"

   "Kewl shit Ken, they always turn me on. I'll go over to the computer"
   , says Neil.

   Neil wanders on over to the LinuxBox-1.0.9 and disables shields
   so that they can tap Subspace communications.

   Seconds later.... "Duuhhh... Ken, I appear to be detecting some sort of
   virus on incoming packets...Is that a problem.???" asks Neil.

   "Err... nar, mcAfees TSR Virus shit will stop that" claims Ken.

   "You stupid fuckstick Ken, mcAfee is a piece of shit" yells Neil.

   "Fuck you Neil, just shuttup and tune into those partylines"

   Whilst the boys are arguing the Missing Link is hit by a spacetime worm
   and system by system start going dead.

   "Doh, you dumb cunt Neil, can't you do anything right!?!?" yells Ken.

   "Shuttup Ken, I can't see shit, wheres the light switch?? I think..."

   Before Neil can finish his sentence wierd lights and shit start happening
   from within the replicators.

   "AARRGHH!! Ken!!! WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY!!?!?!" screams Neil.

   About 10 wierd looking creatures start popping out of replicators, their
   Space-time network worm had haxored the ship computer and was now making
   aliens.  They had badass guns and were blowing shit up... Cracking sounds
   happened as the aliens legs snapped back.

   "WE ARE THE ZidZils AND WE ARE GUNNA MAKE YOU PISS!" Say the creatures in
    wierd voices.

   "Oh shit!! We're whoomped! I'm outta here" yells Neil, as he jumps into
   an escape pod.

   "Wait for me Neil honey!!" screams Ken, but Neil doesn't give a shit,
   and seals the escape pod.

   As Neil's escape pod blasts off and heads for FEDeration HQ, he sees Ken get
   booted out of the Missing Link by some random alien, his body floating around
   in space before finally the Missing Link explodes into 1 million fiery pieces
   (that took a long time to count you know).

   The End (or so we can only wish).

                           Motorola Brick Phones


   Usage of Cellular Telephones
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I do not condone or encourage any person, living or dead, to use the
   information contained with in this article for any illegal purpose.
   (See NeuroCactus Main Disclaimer)

   If you are considering reprogramming a cellular phone with another
   persons details and then fraudulently calling your friends all over
   the world, forget it!

   Every number you call will show up in their records as well as the
   cellular cell that you called from and any subsequent cells you moved
   to. You will get caught, don't do it.


   Identifying a Suitable Brick Phone
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In a previous issue of NeuroCactus (Issue 6), I detailed how I modified
   a Motorola Bag phone, since then I have been experimenting further and
   have now successfully reprogrammed a Motorola Brick phone.

   These phones are common in their modern form, however the phone which I
   used was one of the older type, which I call a "fat-brick", they are
   taller and fatter than the modern bricks.

   In achieving this modification I used two fones, the first was one
   bought cheaply by myself, it unfortunately had a modern ROM, that
   could not be used to reprogram the ESN/MIN, however it was socketed
   and it is a 27C256, unlike the bag phones, which are a 27C512 ROM.

   The second brick phone was a slightly older model and was loaned to
   me by a friend for a short time, I'd just like to say thanks to this
   person, even if you don't know why I wanted your phone.

   The first phone I got was grey and had a model number of S3015A, the
   second was beige and its model number was unreadable, however it did
   not have a FCN (Function) button, this is probably a safe way of
   telling if the phone has an old enough ROM version. The second phone
   is the preferable model to use as it has an early enough ROM version
   already in it. It is easy to change the ROM once you get into the
   phone, however getting in and out of the phone without wrecking it is
   NOT easy.


   Equipment Used
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following equipment is a list of the equipment that I have
   personally used to reprogram a Motorola Bag Fone.

   1 x Motorola Brick Fone
   1 x Reprogramming Cable (See next Section)
   1 x Mot911 Software (Motorola V9.11 Reprogramming SW)
   1 x 286 8MHz PC running MS-DOS
   1 x 7.5 Volt Brick Phone Battery
   1 x Pre 9122 Motorola EPROM (I used v9027 of the EPROM)


   Building a Reprogramming Cable
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A reprogramming cable is not difficult to make, I used the following
   components:

   1 x Male D Connector (25 Pin)
   1 x Female D Connector (25 Pin)
   2 x D Shells (25 Pin)
   1 x 30cm of 7 Core Cable


   The diagram of the cable I used is slightly different to what is
   commonly available on the net:

        Computer            Back of Transceiver
        Printer Port        Upper Section Near
        (Male DB 25)        the Ariel


         1<-->K         o o o    o o o
         2<-->F         A B C    D E F
         3<-->C
         4<-->D         o o o    o o o
        12<-->J         G H I    J K L
        13<-->H
        18<-->G

   It is a very simple cable to build, and there are a couple of ways
   to do it, if I had been planning on doing many modifications I would
   of used a handsfree adaptor kit as they are easily modified to suit
   the above and supply power. However as I had no need to make many
   modification, after all I was doing it purely as a test, I simply
   soldered the wires directly onto the phone.

   To supply power to the phone, all you need to do with this method is
   gently slide the battery up until it touch's the battery contacts on
   the transceiver, do not however push it all the way up as you will
   probably break the wires.


   Reprogramming
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I am not going detail the use of the MOT911 software again, if you are
   curious as to how it works, then please see my article in NeuroCactus
   Issue 6.

   The only difference between programming the bag phone and the brick
   phone with this software is the type of phone selected, for a bag
   phone select option three (3), for a brick phone select option two
   (2).


   Conclusion
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   Once again the above can be used to modify the various options of
   your phone when you purchase new equipment for it, however don't
   forget what I said in the disclaimer, using the above information
   for changing the ESN/MIN is illegal, DON'T DO IT. (Don't forget
   the free scotch(s) if we ever meet.)

   Have you often read a magazine and wanted  more issues?  Perhaps  you
   want to get into the Hack/Phreak scene a bit more but dont  know how.
   Maybe you just want to start collecting some  files to  trade..  Well
   heres the article to get you on your way with the  best public  sites
   around. Well with everyone on the net these days I've  decided to  do
   an article on where to find hack/phreak magazines and files.

   The first chart details some cool Hack/phreak magazine sites that are
   still making issues for the underground users.  These sites  are  all
   checked. I'm not  doing  a  listing  of  all magazines, only those  I
   feel relevant to the  underground  scene. If people want CUD etc they
   can find them elsewhere. I have included  both  the  FTP and WWW
   adresses where possible as some sites FTP's are so damn slow these
   days.

   The second chart contains a few sites with LARGE  archives  of  older
   magazines. Also to be found  on  these  sites  can  be  miscellaneous
   other hpa files. Just check one of these out and you have an  instant
   textfile collection. The last part deals with  some  Web  sites  that
   have cool files to download from.

   All sites will be listed in alphabetical order.  If you get  some new
   issues dont forget to upload them  to  my BBS  if I  dont  have  them
   allready! 8-) Now no one can say where do I get some files off of the
   internet.

   Heres another fine update to the Perth Payphone listing. Thanks to an
   anonymous user using the NC account on the BBS with a upload of other
   payphones from WA. The list did contain some  of  the  ones  released
   from previous NC issues.

   If there is anyreaders out there who have other payphone listings for
   Perth or infact any other state, please dont  hesitate to  forward it
   to me for release is a future issue  of the  magazine.  You  will  of
   course be credited for the information (unless you dont wish it).

   I've also noticed that quite a few payphones now report there number
   as 9300-**** so you cant actually get the number. Usually phones that
   are located in areas close to important buildings like court houses
   and police stations etc etc.

                             - The Basics -

Bus tickets, phone cards and credit cards all contain atleast one thin
strip of magnetic media stuck to one side of the card. Sometimes this is
not visible, in the case of phone cards, but it can normally be seen as
a black line, about 6mm across, running the length of the card. It is
this strip that contains all of the information stored on the card. In
the case of a bus ticket it is simply the amount of trips remaining, the
last time it was validated (date & time), the type of ticket
(student/concession/standard), and often a serial number to indicate
where the ticket was purchased. It is also possible to store the
location of the last place the ticket was validated, ie. the station
number, or the bus number. With all this information it has become very
easy for inspectors to tell whether the your ticket is valid or not.
However if you create your own tickets this sort of thing will no longer
be a problem.

Phone cards contain information about AutoDial numbers, the original
value of the ticket, the remaining value, a serial number, and it is
also possible to store the last number that was dialled using the card.
However credit cards are a bit more complex. On all credit cards and ATM
cards there are three strips containing the information, although in
most cases only two of the strips are used. The first of these stripes
is known as "IATA" is used to store your name, and personal information.
The second stripe is known as "ABA", this contains all of the good stuff
like the card number, account number, and the pin number (sorry it's
encrypted, they're not going to make it too easy!). The final stripe is
not normally used, but was intended as a place to record ATM
transactions that could not be recorded by the banks computers, ie. when
the card was used after hours while the computers were offline, however
now the systems are kept online 24 hours a day so this strip has become
unnecessary. Credit cards are a rather complex topic and i don't have
time to go into anymore detail at the moment, so for this file I will
try to concentrate on bus tickets, however i will try to release a file
in the next few months that only deals with credit cards.

                      - How the data is stored. -

Understanding the method in which the data is stored on the ticket is
the key to understanding how they work and how they can be reproduced.
The strip, or track, uses very similar material to that used in cassette
tapes and floppy disks. This is a ferromagnetic media that is formed by
adding particles, no larger than 8 millionths of a centimetre long, to a
very thin resin which is then hardened. These particles when exposed to
a magnetic field remain magnetised after the field has been removed,
this is why cards are able to hold the information indefinitely. To put
it simply the information is just a series of north and south magnetic
fields arranged in varying orders. It is actually possible to view these
fields by covering the track in a very thin covering of very fine iron
filings. If you are able to do this you should find that it looks
something like this:

             Header               Data              Footer

Take note that this is a simplified diagram, on most bus tickets there
is over 100 bars, not including the 20 header and 20 footer bars. Data
is written from the left to the right and almost always starts and
finishes with a header and a footer. These are used to line the ticket
up when being read so that the device knows where to start looking for
the information. The bars are formed at every change in the polarity of
the magnetic field, as indicated in the following diagram.

When the normal polarity arrangement, of North - South - North - South,
is interrupted by two or more of the same polarities occurring side by
side, the result is a "missing" bar or bars. This is what the readers
are looking for. The way in which the readers work is by using the
header information to position themselves at the start of the data, and
then use a very accurate timing device to calculate their position as
the ticket is moved across the head. At every time interval the head
reads the ticket and logs the "bit", as either a 1, in the case of North
- North or South - South polarities, and a 0 in the case of the normal
North - South arrangement. It then continues to move until the next time
interval is reached, at which point it reads the ticket and logs the
result. This process continues until the footer info is reached. After
the data is processed the ticket is then written to in much the same way
as it is read. The ticket is aligned again and then moved across the
write head until the correct time interval is reached, the head then
changes the data by changing the polarity to either a North or South
direction. This continues until the updated info has all been written to
the ticket and the ticket is ejected.

                          - The Data itself -

Unfortunately, rather being in a simple binary form, the data found on
most magnetic cards is encoded using one of several different methods.
With the exception of credit cards (which are standardised), it is
normaly left up to the company who produces the system to select, or
create, an encoding method. The result of this is a multiple number of
systems that just make it harder to understand, and decode, the data
from one card to the next. This also means that you wont be able to read
the data from a bus ticket by using a credit card decoder, and vice
versa.

However, if your lucky enough to live in either SA or Tas you've got
your work cut out for you! Both SA and Tas use the same transit
ticketing systems, and this system has been decoded!

The following is the bitstream of a SA/Tas unused multitrip transit

Thanx must go out to Dataphobia for the many late nights he spent
decoding the above bitstreams. Without his help I would have never got
past staring at raw 'garbage'.

                       - How to make your own! -

Now for the bit you've been waiting for... How to make your own. Well
there are several ways that you can go, but unfortunately they all
require at least a basic understanding of electronics. But it doesn't
take a technician to it. All you really need to know is how to solder
some wires, but understanding the fundamentals would be a great help. If
you think that your up to it, or if you think you can find someone to do
it for you, read on.

                              - Method 1 -

The first method is the least complicated, but is not guaranteed. All it
requires is an old deck to deck tape recorder, a bit of wood and super
glue, some wire, and a Data write head. The data write head is the only
problem you should have, unfortunately the quality of most audio heads
is two low and you will find that it may not be able to change the
magnetic polarity enough so that it can be read correctly. To obtain
these heads you will need to try and find a company that deals in
"Magnetic technologies", "magnetic data equipment", or if your lucky you
might be able to find a "disposals" auction where you MIGHT be able to
pick up a cheap security card swipe device or something along those
lines. Once you have everything it is simply a matter of removing the
read head from one of the decks. This is the small silver box located
down the bottom of the deck near the middle, that moves forward when you
press play. It should only have two wires coming from it and no more
that two screws holding it in. Now you need to disconnect the two wires
running to the write head on the other deck. This head will ONLY move
forward when record is pressed and is normally made from white plastic.
Once you have done this it its time to set up the heads.

The idea is to position the heads exactly opposite each other so that
they will pass over two tickets placed side by side at exactly the same
time. To do this, take the piece of wood (a ruler will do if your REALLY
desperate) and glue the read head from the cassette to one side and the
data write head to the other side. If you do it correctly you will be
able to stick two tickets to a piece of cardboard and, holding the end
of the piece of wood, move both heads over the magnetic strips, so that
they are always making contact and start and finish at the same time.

Now for the electronics. Get yourself a soldering iron and connect the
wires coming from the recorder part of the tape deck to the data write
head. It's pretty hard to stuff this up, but just incase your having
problems, you need to remove a little of the plastic covering the wires
and then taking one wire at a time hold it onto one of the connections
on the head (there should only be two) and solder away. Then repeat this
with the other wire on the other connection. The read head should still
be connected, which means your ready to go.

Now its simply a matter of getting a new ticket and one of your old ones
that you've been getting your friends to collect for you, and place them
side by side. I've found that it's easer to put them on a piece of
styrofoam and use pins around them (not through them) to hold them down,
this means that they can be pushed down a bit so that both the heads
make a good contact. You will either need to overlap the tickets or use
a spacer between one of the heads and the piece of wood so that the
heads pass EXACTLY over both the tracks at the same time. Then all you
need to do is press play on the READ part of the tape deck and RECORD on
the write part (u may need to push the lever up the top of the deck down
so that it thinks there is a tape in there. Or just leave a tape in it,
it wont get erased). Now, holding the end of the wood, move both the
heads across the tickets. Make sure that you start at the beginning and
move ALL the way along the track, and make sure you get the tickets
around the right way (read head on the NEW ticket), or you will end up
copying the used ticket! btw, its a good idea to erase the used ticket
first, by moving a magnet from one end of the track to the other. And
thats IT!... you now should have a brand new ticket!

If you find it didn't work try it again a couple of times. If it still
stuffs up you may need to use the circuit below.

                              - Method 2 -

Now for method two. This is the best of the two but it requires a fairly
good understanding of electronics. If you find that you dont understand
it go to an electronics store and buy a book about "beginning in
Electronics", or something like that, and have a read. If you still have
problems its not worth even trying, because unless you get everything
right it just wont work, and you may find that you've waisted your time
and your hard earned money. If your still reading you must be either
very determined to do this or have a very good knowledge of electronics,
or both. All i can say is best of luck and tell me if you have any
success.

The following is a schematic of the circuit you will need to build. I
recommend that you make a printed circuit board to put it on and make
sure you can get all the components before you start. The basic
principle is that by using an "op-amp" you can amplify the signal
created in the read head to a level where it is strong enough to be used
by the write head. To do this properly you should only use DATA read and
write heads. The circuit uses an ic that contains two op-amps, both of
which are used. To prevent the signal from amplifying too much, both
op-amps have there output feed back to the input via a resister and a
cap. The 10kà variable is used to set the output at the level which is
found to be the best for both the heads and the type of tickets. The
circuit requires a +9V and a -9V supply so two batteries are used for
this. Aside from that it should be rather self explanatory.

Unfortunately it is the best that I could do, short of making a gif. If
it looks shocking, you will need to change the display to 50 lines, if
you want to have any chance of making sense out of it.

The op-amp should be available from most electronics store for a couple
of dollars, if they dont have one ask them to look up the equivalents
and then buy one of them. All up the components (excluding the heads)
and the pcb should not cost you anymore than $10 (about the cost of 2
bus tickets =] ). There is no switch for the unit but it isn't too hard
to disconnect the batteries when you've finished using it. Everything
else after this point is the same as the first method. Its just a matter
of attaching the heads to the piece of wood and running them over the
tickets. But once again, make sure you get the heads around the right
way, so you dont copy the used ticket, and it is a good idea to wipe the
old ticket first using a magnet.

                            - Phone cards -

By now you should be able go and buy a new bus ticket for the very last
time and copy it onto every other ticket you can find. But by now you
will have realised that this method could also be used on phone cards as
well as bus tickets. Well your right. And theres much more money that
can be made by selling phone cards too.

Phone cards use two strips, one containing the remaining credit and
original card value, the other contains stored phone numbers (autocall
numbers), and the total amount that has been 'debited' from the card. As
per normal, the data is arranged into several fields which are dedicated
to containing certain information.

For example, it is believed that the first two blocks, on track 1,
contain the total value of the card. Blocks 4 through 14 contain the
remaining value. On track 2 there are seven blocks of varying sizes, the
first two contain information that is yet to be decoded (possibly a
serial number), the second two blocks are for the autocall numbers. The
final three blocks contain information written to the card by the phone
itself, this includes autocall flags, and is believed to include a date
of last use and a checksum.

A contact inside telstra also informs me that there is provision for the
the card to contain information regarding competitions and promotions
(first two blocks on track two). In theory the card can become a lottery
ticket, the payphone telling you if and what you've won. This info is
yet to be confermed, and it is not expected that telstra will be putting
it to use for a while to come.

The following is the bitstream of a $5 card (thanx to Predator):

The group of 120 clock pulses separate the 'permanent' data from the
data that is written to the track by the phone. Obviously this data
would include the autocall number (center two lines), which in this case
has been left in the original, 'blank' form.

Copying these cards should be rather straight forward using the above
methods. The only thing you may need to change is the spacing of the
heads so that they run over the phone card tracks. The best way to setup
an operation such as this would be to go out once and buy a single $50
or $100 phone card and a dozen or so $2 phone cards. Then go home and
wipe the $2 cards and replace the data with that on the high value card.
Doing this could result in quite a nice amount of income for yourself.

                              - Warning -

But a word of warning; This exact operation was setup by a small group
of people several years ago. They changed $2 cards into $50 cards and
then sold them for $20 each. But their instant income stopped flowing
one day after about 2 years of success and only 3 months of a federal
investigation. To the best of my knowledge they are all still serving
prison terms for there "High Tech" adventures. However they must be
congratulated, although they only lasted for 2 years they managed to
conduct everything from right under the noses of the enemy... They were
already in jail!

                                - BYE! -

I'll be releasing a couple of new files in the near future, just as soon
as i get the opportunity. One of them will probably be the follow up to
this file, dedicated to Credit card copying. If you've got any questions
about this or related topics i'll do my best to help you. But don't come
crying to me saying "I can't get it to work". To anyone who is
successful in making this, it would be great to hear some feedback or
comments and suggestions from you. I can be contacted on The ZeNitH in
SA, DS2 in WA or at Wizard@hpaus.net.

The Following is a listing of every AMPS base station located in New
South Wales. All ID codes are outlined at the top of the list. We intend
to try to type up, and release, listings for atleast South Aust and
Victoria for NC9 & NC10 respectivly.

Thanx must go out to our great friends at Telstra for their assistance in
assembling this list. :)

   Well this is just a general chat to all the hack/phreak enthusiants out
   there in the cyberspace world. Each week I receive quite a bit of mail
   from various "up and coming" possible phreaks from mainly around Australia
   each wanting to know how to do this that and the other thing.

   The days of boxing are limited, digital equipment put in place by the
   various telephone companys has practically halfed the number of possible
   methods of obtaining free calls etc. The other thing to note is how easily
   you can be monitored and recorded on digital systems. A few key strokes at
   the exchange or via a dialin connected to them and your entire privacy is
   out the window. As much as various people deny the fact that this is done
   and all the random bullshit about court orders and things to that effect
   mean nothing.

   Dont get me wrong here, Im not saying that things are soo bad that its
   impossible to get away with anything. As soon as one method is stopped
   something new comes along. The next series of crimes continue to fester
   accross the internet at alarming speeds. Its allready been proved several
   times over how crap Internet security really is (optik surfer/Ausnet) and
   as soon as something good comes along the authors get busted up (PGP
   example here), and as usual the Americans get all touchy.
   
   Well finally to the state of Neurocactus and the Team. Well the team has
   gradually lost members and the main ideas behind the mag are really not of
   our interest too much these days. FRaC and Myself are now full time employed
   with various computer related jobs and have no time to play around with
   equipment. Its time for us to move along. As mentioned this issue was meant
   to be released around about 3 years ago now so I recall but with this and
   that its delayed and even today we are releasing with out the input of Dking
   except for one article left out of the last Issue. We still can be found
   floating around the net on efnet usually and as long as physically possible
   we will try to remain with the same email adress's and ofcourse there is
   always ICQ.

   Dking well we lose track of what he is actually doing. He seems to float
   from one Job to the next, well we can only hope maybe one day he might
   actually release another Issue on his own (into the the next millenium
   at this rate).

   Destiny Stone II BBS is still one of the longest serving BBS's in the
   Ozzie scene running for some 9 Years this September. No longer in its
   prime though It will continue to be online to serve its existing members.
   The BBS scene has gone to hell since the Net has come along and I guess
   with STD Calls etc and the many overseas callers that used to dial it
   daily It will continue for sometime to come. Im hoping one day to X-Fer
   all the files onto the Net one day. Look out for my new ftp Page LEVEL4
   when its online. It will carry the largest range of HPA files in the world
   with close to 50,000 files online when it is completed, then i just got to
   find a internet provider to put it onto but more about that later.

   Anyways cheers to all my "scene" friends past and present. If you called
   my BBS in the past please email me as I like to keep in touch with the
   old-school. Greetz to : The Pick, Minnow, Invisible Stalker, Freestyle,
   Hook, Jam, Ginnie (and all Brewery Callers), Scourge, Anubis (all temple
   callers), X-Static, Slash, Mafiozo, Blade, Dataphobia, Jester, Malice, UQ1
   Shane (and all the Morgue Callers) , PHATE Worldwide (Kuji, Methodman
   Datastream Cowboy, Maelstrom) - Probably the only crew in the world
   in which every member got busted!, Scavenger the German Dialer Man, All
   the guys in the PC-Express BBS crew for a great system and I guess AMI-X
   from where it originated, and I guess all the Dudes in all my groups i
   have supported across the decade from the 64 Scene to Today (US Team,
   Akira, Fusion, Liberty, PHaTe, uXu, BGR, VLaD, Maim, Immortal Riot,
   HiJacK and most of all Neurocactus. Dont think I missed anyone cept for
   my main partner in crime, FRaC - Thanks heaps dude.

    Well I think Ripmax summed it all up in his little chat session.
    All of us in the Neurocactus team all have full time commitments
    outside the scope of defrauding the telco's of their rightful earnings.
    It is quite amusing though, the fact that all of the Neurocactus team
    are employed in communications related fields, working with the
    types of equipment that used to be our best friends/worst enemies.
    By no means should this disheart fellow phreakers. In the end, only
    career phreak's will be in this game a lifetime. Ive only ever met one
    person who has been phreaking all his life, and even makes significant
    earnings from living a life of hacking. Unfortunately I dont wish to be
    the next captain crunch, so Im going to keep studying the in's and out's
    of communications in another way. To my great adverseries in the Fed head-
     quarters, youve done a good job keeping up, though youll never be on par
    with the people at the frontiers of new technology. The phreakers.
