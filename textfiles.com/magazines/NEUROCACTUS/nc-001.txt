      Just a quick note regarding the demise of most of the DMSE numbers
   and a couple of add - ons (so to speak).  The  reason for this is not
   entirely certain, however it has been rumoured (and stated by various
   Telecom sources) that the -1-800- numbering system is almost finished
   with only the -1-800-12X-XXX- range to be completed.  These exchanges
   are basically direct mirrors of the -0014-800-12X-XXX- numbers.

      The Melbourne 2 system dialup (CBD) also went down on the same day
   and the alternate number was no longer accessable from most areas.

      Rumours are  also currently  afoot that -008-032-486- is currently
   being  monitored,  however this has not been confirmed in any way and
   we at NeuroCactus tend to believe it is fairly safe for general use.

      However, all Voice Mail users are urged to spread their calls over
   as many dialups as possible and not overusing specific dialups.

      On Friday the 3rd of December at 9:00pm the  national  MessageBank
   network  was  taken  offline  for a major  software  upgrade. The new
   version  of software is  Trilogue  version  4.4.  All systems are now
   running the new software.  Sydney 1 was the first to come online with
   the new software  at around 4.00am (congrats to the  Haymarket team!)
   Melbourne 1 and 2 were both reported  back on line not long after the
   deadline of 6.00am,  although Adelaide and CNS were slower.  Adelaide
   came online at 7.10am,  while bugs in the most complex msgbank server
   (CNS) meant that it didn't come back on line until around 8:50am.

   Whats new in V4.4?
   ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
      The most visible  changes to  the user  will be a quantum  leap in
   security.  Version  4.4  has eliminated the possibility of  unlimited
   password  attempts.  Any attempt to "hash" out of a password  attempt
   after  getting it wrong will be met with a short  sharp "click".  The
   older "* *" trick will get a similar reponse. This spells the end for
   sequential  hacking of boxes,  and NeuroCactus have  indefinately put
   plans well down the track to release a new version of TVMBT.

      Interestingly, no hacked mailboxes on any system have been lost in
   the upgrade,  although if Telecom had half a brain this version would
   contain tighter auditing of accounts to quickly find virgin mailboxes
   accumulating  large  bills.  This is  still a  possibility,  and will
   become evident in a few weeks as we all use our boxes.

      Behind the scenes,  Inter-system mail has been fine tuned and sped
   up, with initial tests showing message transfer on east coast systems
   to be close to realtime.

      Neil Campbell,  Detective  Sergeant  Ken Day and one other unknown
   Telecom official stand aboard the bridge of the Starship MissingLink.
   Suddenly the navigational officer, John Blackman, alerts Captain Day.

      "Captain,  our pre - historic CLI sensors have detected an unknown
   entity  shifting  through the Melb / Exec galaxy.  Its  origin is not
   currently known.  It appears to be hostile."

      "Proceed to co-ordinate 8003 at warp 7,  Dr Black" replies Captain
   Day as the Starship M.L. zooms out of the Infoline sector and through
   the Messaging star clusters.

      Meanwhile, aboard the mercenary pirate cruiser The R2,  Captain T.
   Pick is recording some techno messages on Grudges VMB. Captain Minnow
   is sitting  over in the corner  picking out  obscure  bugs  in  TVMBT
   version 1.0.  The 486 is sitting on top of the 250 watt speakers that
   are  currently  booming out a  track by  Cellblock  X.  First Officer
   Scourge is smoking cigarettes and read Virtual Light.

      "Hey,  the 486 has got another exec for us" says Minnow in a bored
   sounding voice.

   "Virgin?" enquires Officer Scourge

   "Nope"

   "leave it alone" replies Mr Pick

   Back aboard the Missing Link...

   "Sir, the entity has taken form as a series of sound waves."

      "By god,  that's DTMF!"  exclaims  first  officer  Campbell as the
   tones are emitted at regular intervals.

   "Captain, we have initiated scans on the being's source."

      "Approaching sector 8003,  Captain" states Officer X,  the unknown
   occupant of the AXE starship.  "Shields activated."

   "Yellow Alert" proclaims Security Officer Campbell, "Phasors ready."

      Aboard The R2,  Captain Minnow glances at the control panel on his
   S12 system and notices the Telecom warning indicator on.

   "Well, looks like Mr Day and associates are trying to get CLI going."

      "I though I smelt something....."  replies Mr Scourge "Hey,  we're
   being hailed.  Open communication frequency."

      The  image  of  Captain  Day  flickers  up on to the main  screen.
   Immediately Captain Minnow interrupts him.

      "Finished playing games, Mr Day?" Mr Pick asks,  knowing well what
   the reply will be.

   "It's not a game... uhIt's a criminal act." replies Captain Day.

      "Dammit,  sorry Ken,  I didn't  have  the  line  in on the  Gravis
   UltraSound plugged in properly...  Can you say that again just with a
   slight speech impedemant so we can sample it properly?" Says The Pick
   while fiddling with the line in adapter.  Captain  Day looks suitably
   unimpressed.  Minnow snickers.  Scourge lights another...

      The  Missing  Link  closes the channel and iniates their primative
   CLI device.

      "No information... to identify... telephone... number.." reads out
   the artificial voice.

      Aboard the R2 Minnow  casually sets the ship's phasor torpedo guns
   to Medium - Well done.

      "Captain,   it  appears  the  R2's  source  is  coming  from...  A
   disconnected number!?!?" says Officer Campbell.

      "Ah well, whatdya say, wanna go to that rave now?"  Captain Minnow
   asks The Pick.

      "Why,  what time is it... 11pm,  yeah,  OK let's cruise."  replies
   Captain  Pick and presses space on the 486,  pausing TVMBT instantly.
   Scourge decides to give the Starship ML a quick blast of mailing list
   messages from the phasors to the tune of 100 duplicate messages.

   They hang up and head down to the transporter room.

      Aboard  the  Missing  Link,  Captain  Day is  cursing and having a
   general  spack  (and he thinks WE'RE  antisocial!)  and the  starship
   Missing Link heads for federation territory, trying to circumnavigate
   their way around all the floating mail debris...

      OK,  well some people may  consider this irrelevant and off-topic,
   but we think ethics is extremely important to one's self-preservation
   and safety.  Not only the safety of yourself but your fellow sceners.
   Also, we, as an institution, don't agree with the idea of ripping off
   small time companies.  The governmental or "Big Brother" institutions
   are our main concerns,  as freedom fighters.  That's why we are using
   their equipment not others. Anyway on with the ethical rules...

   1) Don't hack mailboxes that are active  (i.e. actively being used by
   subscribers) Taking active mailboxes that have no password is no more
   than mindless psuedo-hacking. The boxes you get like this will almost
   always go down,  so don't bother doing it.  Aim for virgin mailboxes.
   You will find that these will stay up for much longer  (We've had one
   now for over three years).

   2) Many of the 1800 dialups are owned by private companies and divert
   to the  VMB system  after hours only.  If  you get voice using one of 
   these numbers then for gods sake DO NOT abuse the person at the other
   end.  Preferably, ask for John, and then say you had the wrong number
   and don't ring back during business hours. Alternatively you can just
   hang up, but we prefer the wrong number routine.
   
   3) Because many of the 1-800s are private, the companies who own them
   will  recieve  a bill each month.  For this reason,  don't over use a
   particular  dialup.  If possible,  spread  your calls  around all the
   available  1-800s,  and don't call just  for the hell of it.  Many of
   the 1-800 dialups for various systems have died because  they've been
   hammered to death.  Also, spend time engineering or scanning your own
   dialups.

   4) Finally, if you get hold of extremely powerful information such as
   default password structures, system administrator boxes or modem dial
   in's,  do not,  under any  circumstances,  let your  ego run riot and
   release  info that can  bring down  the entire voice mail system.  So
   perhaps we have learned a little lesson with TVMBT...
