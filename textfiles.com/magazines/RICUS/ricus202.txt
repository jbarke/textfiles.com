1: Opening to RICUS 2.02
------------------------
 
    Welcome to yet another issue of RICUS. This issue is also special,
 because it marks the first birthday of RICUS...
 
    In this issue, we have some cool stuff for you. Particularly,
 that CLAN article is really neat, and I'd like to thank the CLANMan
 for submitting it!
 
    We even got some "Letters to the Editor"-type feedback over
 the last issue! Which is more than I can say for any other... It seems
 our friends in Southern RI weren't too happy when we included their
 OmniNet nodelist/conflist!
 
     Have fun,
                 CyNom

   9: Omni-Net Information
   -----------------------
 OmniNet is a network based on FrontDoor/FidoNet technology, originating
 from southern RI. Someone though it would be cool to get the nodelist,
 conference tag names, etc. So, here they are:
  
   [Editors Note: OmniNet nodelist from RICUS201 not included. ]
   
   Heh, some fool thinks that he has the nodelist for the net...I
   suggest that this f00l get his info straight before he writes for
   RICUS...

   Here come the Rh0dents...bah...

 -----------------------------------------------
 The Editor's Response:
 -----------------------------------------------
  Are you saying that WASN'T the nodelist? I am aware it was a quite old one,
 but much of the information is still valid. I am also aware that some of the
 systems that were supposed to be added to the net and left commented in
 that version of the nodelist were uncommented.

  At any rate, it's nice to see the networks being used to their full 
  potential. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3: ESS? What's That?!
---------------------

 Question: What # ESS is your phone under?
 --------- -------------------------------

Have you ever wondered this? No...? Well, Squinky has! So, he called up the
Operator on his 3-way calling and asked what Electronic Switching System his
phone was under.

 First off, the Electronic Switching System is the computer/switch/piece of
hardware down at your NE Telephone central office. There are different
"types" of ESS systems. Different capabilities, etc. There are even other
switches put out by different companies (like a DMS switch) that perform
the same function as an ESS.

 ESS provides call waiting, call forwarding, three way calling, speed dialing,
and other neat services that weren't available without it. I think the first
one was installed in the mid-1960s. It also has the ability to do nasty things,
like provide dialed number registers (DNRs) and such, which record *every*
number you dial (obviously including BBSes and other electronic "things.")

 Maybe someone who reads this could give us some more info on ESS, what
types there are, different companies who make similar systems, etc.

 In any case, we wanted to fine out what type of ESS we were on, model #,
whatever... This also provided an opportunity to see how many operators
actual knew any of the acronyms you see in text files.

 This was done to about 15 or 20 operators. (Hell, they're probably not
doing anything else! ) After one couldn't answer the question or sat there
for a while (stumped!) we hung up and called another one. 

 Most operators had absolutely no clue what the hell we were talking about.
 We were looking for something like "you're prefix is under 5-ESS" or
"you are under a DMS-10 switch..."

 One of them *did* know the acronym, though. Another one offered to transfer
us to maintainance or something.

 Sample conversation with one of the more knowledgeable operators:
  
  Us: "Hi.. what number ESS are we under?"
  Her: "Well, I _want_ to say Electronic Switching System, but I'm not sure!"

  <That was the most hilarious one of the bunch!>

 One of them said we aren't under ESS anymore, and that "they're all
being changed in different places." Then she said, "maybe you are
under it." I got the distinct impression that these people were
totally, absolutely, utterly clueless.

 Many of them fell silent, unable to understand the query. This was just
pathetic. You'd think they'd have some clue.

 One of them blatantly stated "ESS? This is something I never heard of
before!" Another one replied "Uh.. I have noooo idea what you're
talking about!"

 After dialing about 15 or 20 times, we got one of the same Operators
again. She said "Okay! This is something we've *all* never heard  of
before! Hold the line to speak to my supervisor..." They must've been
chatting among themselves or something. 

 Well, Squinky didn't feel like holding the line... so he hung up.
How rude... I wanted to hear the Supervisor! 

 The next day he called up the operator again. This time a male operator
answered. As usual he asked "what number ESS are we under?" This time
the answer was "Sorry, I can not give that information out." Yes, _sure_
you can't, like it's highly secretive or something. 

 Well, that's that. This just points out that operators aren't very useful,
as far as "technical" info as concerned (not that we'd think they WOULD be,
anyways.)

How to Hack the CLAN network                By:The CLANman

1 February 1993

    I noticed the little ditty at the end of the last RICUS letter,
and since I know alot about the CLAN, I typed this up.


I. Disclaimer:

    I provide this information as an educational tool only. I would
like to remind anyone that engaging in offensive actions on the
network is a Federal Crime. This system has potential for abuse, as
does any. I know many of the "other" features, but I am only showing
how to do an online search when the libraries are closed. Passwords,
phone numbers and programs for the circulation modules have been purposely
not included.

II. Getting to buisness:
    The CLAN system is run out of the Providence Public Library, on
CLSI and WYSE hardware running Dynix library cataloging software in a
UNIX environment. It's principal phone number, as of this writing was
(401)455-8087 N81 1200 bps max. Once you call with your modem, press
enter a few times, and you'll get a logon screen. It is straitforward, as it says DYNIX v1.3.2 and then asks for a login and a password.
   For the login, they are easy. Just put your library's RILN
identifier, followed by Pub. (For example Warwick Public Library's
login is WARPUB, Cranston is CRAPUB, North Providence is NPRPUB. IT
MUST BE IN LOWER CASE! ALL CLAN COMMANDS ARE IN LOWER CASE. If you try
this and you can't get in, I'll explain later how to get your
library's passcode.)

    Library logins:

    Pawtucket           pawpub (*note: password protected for no 
                               reason)
    Providence          propub ("                              ")
    Cranston            crapub
    Warwick             warpub
    Greenville          gvlpub
    Newport             nptpub
    North Prov.         nprpub
    West Warwick        wwrpub
    Barrington          barpub
    East Providence     eplpub
    
(Any other RILN identifier can be found by ordering a book from
the library that you want the idenfifier from, through interlibrary
loan. It'll be written on the blue sheet that is stuck in the cover.)
    In the event that they password protect the logins, do the
following: go to your library, and sit at a computer. Look at the
screen and you will see the options menu. Type the letter q, then this
screen comes up:


                THE COOPERATING LIBRARIES AUTOMATED NETWORK
                              WELCOMES YOU TO
                          [Yourtown's Public] LIBRARY
                         ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOG
 
 
 
 
 
           TO USE THE CATALOG PRESS THE KEY LABELED "<RETURN>".
 
 
                                              
       FOR THE HELP SCREEN PRESS "?" THEN THE KEY LABELED "<RETURN>".

            PLEASE ASK A LIBRARIAN FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE.



    Type the word LATER and press enter a few times. Isn't that
simple? The terminal will logoff to a command line. (This is exactly
what you see if you call on a modem.)
    Press enter many times to get the screen to scroll, as to hide the
fact that you logged off the terminal. Now act like a stupid patron
and walk up to the information desk and say that the computer you were
using went down. Your helpful librarian will go to your terminal and
log you back on. Watch her and you got the password. If you work at a
library, and you don't know the password look on the sides of the
computer screens. Providence Public Library has the passcodes taped to
the monitors, and I've seen this done at many other libraries.
    Once you've got a password, call and log on and now you can look
for books after the local library is closed! Congrat's you have your
own private CLAN node. (How special.)

II. Other goodies on the network:
    The rest of this article is on things you can do at the library,
besides look up books. 
    Logoff the computer, using the proceedure outlined beforehand.
(LATER, etc.) Now you can log it on again as a different town's
library! 
    One fun option is Control-Right Arrow. This makes the info bar on
the top of screen dissappear. But the best option is Control-Caps
Lock. (Press control first, and then without lifting up on Ctrl, press
caps lock.) This will get you into WYSE Works.
    This option has several accessories, namely a calculator,
calendar, alarm clock, and ascii table. For the most fun, go to the
alarm clock. Set about five of the computers to go off during the
lunch period, when the library is understaffed! It's very fun. (Most
of them haven't a clue that WYSE works exists, nevermind how to shut
off the clock.)
    The last command is Ctrl-Break, this "Pauses" the computer until
pressed again. This is great for reserving the computer if you are
going to walk away for a few minutes.

VI. In Closing: This is not the final doc from the CLANman!
    As I compile more info and data, it will appear in furture RICUS
letters. If you find anything out, just upload it seperately to the
"proper channels" for RICUS newletter. I can not be reached on any 
local BBSes.
    One last note, I provide this information for informational
purposes only. I really don't give a crap if you play in the CLAN
system, but do not abuse it. A brief reminder that true hackers don't
trash systems, or do other nasty things. If someone crashes CLAN, its
security will be raised incredibly, so that none of us can get in it.
Secondly, on that same note, don't be a piss-off to the librarians.
They are not the computer people and most of them know how to operate
the basics, but know diddly when it comes to technical stuff. In
short, don't harrass the librarians about the computers, if you don't
they'll be much more helpful than if you are brash. In case you
haven't realized it, the stereotype of the freaky fat old fart
librarian isn't completely true.


Well have fun, and don't get into trouble.

NEXT ARTICLE: HOW TO CRACK THE CLAN BARCODE!

[Editor's Note: Thanks a lot, ClanMan! That was pretty cool... It's also
good to know some people actually read those RICUSes. Naturally there's
gonna be a lot of bitching over this article, but I look at it this way:
Your tax money (or your parents') go to pay for the CLAN system, since it
is public access. Why shouldn't you be able to call in and look up
a book from home? I also heard from someone that a new computer system
is going to be installed in the RI libraries, so this info may be 
invalid very soon.

 While in one of the libraries for a legitimate purpose (doing term paper
research) I heard one of the librarians talking about _Internet_ I couldn't
hear many details, but they recieved some information packet from somewhere
about Internet and it wouldn't surprise me if the local libs became netted
to it eventually. It's like this in some other states already...

 Also, if anyone can figure out how to get to a UNIX Shell from a CLAN
terminal, you'll be able to apply the UNIX info in RICUS 2.01. Remember, 
never delete anything that isn't yours. If they get troubled, they'll
just password everything, and you'll have real problems looking up books
from home. ]

5: The Edge Resigns from Telecom
--------------------------------

[Editor's Note:  The Edge/Deprived Child (a user on some local boards) asked
me to put his "resignation" from BBSing into the next RICUS.  It seems he
wants to be normal or something equally illogical.
  
  Some RICUS dudes were allegedly present at that computer fair on March
6th at CCRI, where we are able to observe The Edge. I personally couldn't
see why he would _want_ to be normal, but at any rate...
 Here's his resignation: ]
 
 
Well...I give up...I had a full BBS'ing life...I enjoyed 99% of it...I
have decided to resign from BBS'ing..I have got to go off and out to the
real world...This is a formal resignation...I probably won't come back...
I would like to thank a few people..

Wonko The Sane: He taught me what a modem was and how to use and abuse
it.. For this I will be forever greatful.
 
Darwin: He helped me go on through BBS'ing he helped me along without
him I would be a regular Lord Soth
 
Daver: Taught me some technical knowledge and let me on his board.
 
Runaway Train: Well...For Never losing patience with me
 
Prince Machiavelli: Helped me through a difficult time with a bad SysOp

Thanks For a wonderful 8 months of Telecomm...All of You..For Taking
me on one of the most Wild Rides of my life So far..

6: Lamah Wars
-------------
                              LaMah WarS

        "General Soth! The Kewl BBSers are attacking! What will we 
do?" whined one of the newly acquired underlings of Soth, ruler of 
all LaMahs. 
        "h0 h0! They dare attack me, ruler of ALL laMahz? I'll 
transform into my 'Laser' form and then prepare to defend my Domain!" 
said the pathetic loser.
        "Sir," cried Major Protogen, they have assembled a decent army!"
        "But they are no match for us! You forget, my lame friend, 
that there are thousands of lamahs in Rhode Island alone, while eLEEt 
d00dz come few and far between! They shall be crushed at the hands of 
my vast army of geekz." Soth assured the major.
        "Dammit, Soth, I'm telling you that these people are very 
formidable! They are lead by the all-powerful Runaway Train!" 
Protogen yelled.
        "Hmmm. RT IS a tough one. Well, get BERN on the phone, call 
in the Springboard branch of laMahs." Soth ordered
        
        As the eLEEt d00dz drew nearer, little Marshall began to 
worry, "What if my army ISN'T enough? How strong are they? Where are 
the Springboarders? What is the mass of a pregnant anteater with 
herpes?"
        Soth sighed with relief at the sight of that wAcKy screamer, 
BERN, and band of babbling idiots from Springboard,"Sigh! Ahh, BERN,  
good to see thou, let us get them, shalt we?"
        "STOP TALKIN' LIKE AN OLD ENGLISH GEEK, MARSHALL!" screamed 
BERN.
        "h0 h0! Let's g0!" yelled Soth, "Ash Maljere, you and Blondie 
send in your group o' laMahs first!"
        "Yes, sir! Let's go Darkness, Blondie, Gravewalker, and the 
rest of you!" Ash Maljere's team flew off, typing lame conversations 
in on their in-ship computers and firing them out in the form of 
photon torpedoes.
        
        Below the castle of Soth, on fonKi little land speeders (like 
the ones in Star Wars), flew the eLEEt, kewl, and generally non-lame 
d00dz. In the front, leading the pArtY was RT, flanked by High Priest 
and Prince Machiavelli (in the form of the mighty beat-downer, 
Officer Mac). Behind them were the newly trained RiCUS teenagers. Wonko
the Sane, Darwin, Morlock, Daver, and Squinky led this group, which
consisted of the cool people from Morlock's Tower and TMoK.
       "oH nO! It's aSh maLjErE! said RT in a frighteningly sarcastic
tone. "You may have lots of soldiers, LaMer, but we have pEEps and Clear
Tab, and we all know Kung-Fu!"
       Well, this threat didn't scare Ash and his band of bumbling
idiotz! No, they kept on firing Lame phrases and sickeningly sappy love
tidings. And RT and his army kept deftly dodging the torpedoes, but once
in a while a torpedo would hit a potentially cool modemer, turning him
instantly into a permanent laMah.
       RT then typed in a command on his commodore, and all of the small
land speeders instantly transformed into X-Wing fighters. "What do you
think about this LaMah? I just don't know..." RT exclaimed.
        
        "Come in Soth! What do we do? They're beating us with their 
superior knowledge of computers!" Ash cried on the intercom. 
        "I'll send my team of new user lamers for backup. Also, if you see 
any other people in the battlefield who just got new computers and 
don't know what's what in modem land, catch them with the LaMah 
tractor beam." Soth advised.
           
        "Eat Tolkein, f00l! The three eLEEt leaders fired 
leather bound editions of The Lord of the Rings at the Lamahz.
        Ka-Boom! The losermobiles exploded and spiralled helplessly 
to the ground. 
        RT, High Priest, and Prince Mac then considered firing their 
mighty pEEps and clear Tab at the enemies, but quickly discarded the 
idea because they decided they'd rather have the g00dies for 
themselves. The Kewl ones were running out of weapons so RT punched 
in a command, and Squinky shot out from his ship and locked on to the 
opposing ships, destroying them one by one. 
        "This psycho missile will surely eliminate the forces of 
lameness!" cried RT, happily.
        
        But he was wrong. Dead wrong.

        From the distant castle the eLEEt army soon found that their 
champion Kamikazi missile was heading back at them. Squinky was 
fleeing? 
        "How can this be?" everyone wondered. (Yep. In unison. Weird, 
huh?) 
        Squinky, on the way back, hit the passing by Necromancer's 
ship, formatting his harddrive. 
        Soon they saw the reason why Squinky was scared away.

        It was big. It was bad. It was back for more. It was LABBE!

        "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH! NOOOOOOOO! It's Flabbe Labbe!" the 
group wailed, "We have to get out of here!"
        "Hello little boys!" Labbe smiled, menacingly, "Would you 
like to play with me?"
        RT kept his cool and calmed down the party. "No. We will not 
leave. We have to put an end to this terror once and for all. Follow 
my lead."
        So they all fired out all of the Labbe jokes ever made 
since his little scandal.
        He laughed and shrugged them off.
        Then they combined skills and hacked his board, destroying 
"tHe fRieNdliEst BbS iN tHe couNtRy".
        He grunted, but recovered, yelling, "Ph00lz! My board does 
not give me the kind of thrill I get from ramming little boys like 
you up the azz!"
        The people gasped. RT's eyes then stared straight at Labbe, 
bloodshot. Rubbing his palms together like a psychotic villain, he 
said quietly, "Well, I guess we'll have to fix that, now, won't we? 
Hah hah."
        He then typed in...

C:\>cd\missile
C:\missile>castrate /Labbe

        And so the missile locked on to Labbe's sack of fun, flung 
from RT's X-Wing, and hit its target. Labbe was not a happy boy.
        
        "Hah!" Yelled RT as his troops swarmed into the now 
defenseless castle of LaMeness and finished off the surviving loozahs.
"Now Modem-Land is safer for all of us c00l m0deming d00dz!" 
        And everyone flew back to the Kung-FU ThEaTre and ate pEEps 
and drank clear Tab and were happy.

        Until they realized that there were always going to be 
modemers looking for some fun, and sometime, somewhere, some new 
LaMah is going to get Telegard, set up a board, advertise it, attract
more LaMahs, and build a new army. Would RT, High Priest and Prince Mac
be able to lead their army to victory and preserve the forces of g00d
throughout Modem-Land once again? 

        To be continued....

7: Hate - A Poem
----------------

Here's a poem I wrote when I was feelin' real mad.  Real bad.
Maybe I still feel that way..
I don't care.

It's called _HATE_.

If you enjoy this, you're sick.. But feel free to anyhow.
----
Society.  I loathe you.

I hate your bubbling sitcoms.

I hate your cheerleaders and your jocks.

I hate your leaders and your enemies.

I hate you all.

I hate you for your mindless happiness that can never be mine.

I hate you with a with a rage that burns inside my mind, inside my being.

I hate your social events, your rules, your authority and most of all I
hate your lies.  Your lie of a dream, your lie of a hope. Your lie of a
better tomorrow.  Your lie of reality.

I hate you because I need you.

I hate myself for needing you.

I hate you because I love you.

I hate you for being me and reflecting in me.

I hate you for never letting me go, never giving me peace.

I hate you for creating me.

I hate you for confining me.

I hate you for pleasing me, for making me glad.

I hate you for blinding me.

 knew that anyways, though.]

8: Sons of Liberty
------------------
 
   RICUS has a "sister" textfile group, known as Sons 0f Liberty. RICUS
has traditionally published in the e-zine format, with more than one 
article per file. In contrast, S0L publishes small textfiles, one article
per file. 
   
   S0L also publishes the more offensive material, and is under a seperate
management/seperate editor. (Some may wonder if it can get any more offensive
than some past RICUS articles.. believe me, it can! ) 
 
   The concept of S0L has been around for months and months, it just took
something to "inspire" the group to start moving. This inspiration came
in the form of another textfile group in RI, SpEaKer fOr tHe PeOpLe, which
circulates in IBM .COM file format, even though it's all text. [Note:
recently they changed over to all .txt format... good going guys.]     
   
   Look for the S0Lxxx.TXT series of files on a info/text board near you!

9: Closing
----------

  This concludes RICUS Volume 2, Issue 2. There weren't as many articles
submitted as I would've like to see. As usual, we welcome feedback through
any of the RI local nets, including Fido-323 (General Chat), NENet (NECommon),
WinCNet (preferably in the Teen echo.)
     
  Also, anyone can submit an article to RICUS. Even those big-board sysops
that always seem to get bashed!! ;) The article needs to be submitted through
the "proper channels." If you relatively intelligent, it shouldn't be to
difficult to discover who your submission should be given to. If you aren't
relatively intelligent, you shouldn't be reading this anyways! <Grin>
