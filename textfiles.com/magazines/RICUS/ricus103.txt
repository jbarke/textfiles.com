 1: Introduction
 ---------------
 
  Welcome to Issue 3 of RICUS! Rumors of our death have been greatly
 exagerated. <grin>
  
  Thanks to a few textfile couriers, the last issue was distributed
 far out of the intended audience, to places far and away, and even into
 the hands of the very "net tyrants" themselves.
  
   In this issue, we present a look at RISA, RI Sysops Association,
 in other words, the Anti-RICUS. We even include the very RISA information
 packet itself.

   Have fun...
   

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2: RISA Information Packet
 --------------------------
 
   Okay, RISAFORM.ZIP was acquired... What follows is a critique of it.
  
  RISAFORM.ZIP contained the following files:
   
    read.me      - a file containing a plug for Microchip BBS
    risa992.doc  - a file, which we will see later, containing
                  info about "RISA", the RI Sysops Association.
   
    infoform.exe - an program which generates a "RISA application"
                   (40k in size, by the way. We will examine it later.)
     
    infoform.me  - a "sample" RISA application
    
 Risa992.doc contained the following text, for those who have not acquired
it through other means: [note, my comments have been added between the

About The RISA Association
--------------------------

 The RISA Association is an association which created in order to stop
hackers and keep news around about whats going on in the state and
what to watch out for. This is an emergency group which is avaliable
to you through a one networked conference. This conference is
networked and echoed through a front end mail system called Front Door
or any other Fido Compatable mail system. We have chosen to use the
front end mailer so that in the event of an emergency or if there is
CRASH mail sent out, it would just bounce from system to system. The
mail routing will be very similiar to the mail routing used in 323
Net. 323 Net ive found to be very stable.
 Mainly this organization was brought together to monitor hackers and
there every move. This is made to help the rate of Tele/anarchists
decrease over the next couple of months. Anyone who would like to join
this unique network should run INFOFORM.EXE so you can find out how to
join.

[Hrumph, Howie, I thought you got KICKED OFF 323 net? You found it to
 be "stable"? Hmm? Do the alias messages ring a bell?
 
 On another note, the entire risa992.doc file was poorly written and 
 expressed very little knowledge of spelling, grammer, or advanced
 vocabulary. Not only is Howie a m0Dem FeWl, but poorly educated,
 as well. <big grin>  -ed]

Leadership
--------------------------

 I have created this association and I want it to grow strong against
the hackers. As you know, most organizations have a leader or a
president, vice president, and it is voted on. I would like to get
this organization moving so that we can stop the busting of hackers
throughout the state. If you would like to join, on your Info. Form /
Registration Form, There will be a box; and if you would like to be a
president of this, mark the box and the voting campaign will be held
at my voting booth at 401-934-2757.

[ First off, "stop the busting" means you DON'T WANT THEM TO GET IN
  TROUBLE. Sure, neither do I; we agree in this regard. <g>
   
  However, I don't think that's quite what you meant. You seem to be
  opposed to hackers and getting them in trouble would be just what
  you WANT. Again, your lack of writing skills shows.
  
  One day you will be able to write high quality, professional documents
  such as this one! -ed.]

 [Well, duh, like I couldn't have figured it out? You're really scraping
  the bottom of the telecom barrel here, aren't you? 
  
  That's no surprise, the finest minds in RI telecom are already with US.
  
  Also, what the heck is this "run at"? It's again readily apparant you
  haven't even the most basic grasp of English.

Prejudices
---------------------------

I know that most sysops do not favor teens. I am a teen sysop and do
not like prejudice people. I know a few people who run BBS's who are
prejudice to teens. I know alot of you think that im just a kid
fooling around. But im really not. I also realize I won't get hardly
any adults to join this because they think that im to inmature; Which
I call prejudice. If you want to be prejudice and not join, thats ok.
Im just asking. I have a sense of humor as most sysops do with a few
exceptions.

 [ GoSh! I hope you have a sense of humor about this and don't go and
  try to kill us or something! I'm just shaking in my booties...
   
  On another note, who CARES if most Sysops "favor teens" or not?
  Obviosly, we don't care. Many of the best Sysops are in their teens (or
  atleast under 25. Hah hah!)  

  I think you just want to try and be "professional."
  
  We called your board a few times, "anarchy supported in the message
  bases." What a crock! You want to "support anarchy", and then you
  come out with this? That seems slightly contradictory, IMO. -ed. ]
     
                                  Thank You

---------- End of RISA992.TXT ---------------
  
 Ok, well guys, that was an informative document, wasn't it? 
 At the very least, it was amusing.
 
 Ok... now for the analysis infoform.exe, a 40584 byte MS-DOS
 executable (duh!) I examined the file with my handy hex editor,
 
 (you all really should get one, you can do neat things like modify
  any program of your choice to reflect your name instead of the
  company who produced it, change text in the program, edit BlueWave
  packets <BIG grin>, the usual chaos.)
   
 and determined it was written in MS QuickBasic (presumably
 version 4.5) Now, upon running this program, it puts up a 
 s0oPer KeWl RISA logo, made out of slashes and shaded blue
 and white. It's really a site to see (yeah,right!) and adds
 some much needed glory to the RISA name.
 
 It then puts if a neat little application, asking things such
 as "Your Name", "Your Voice #", "Your BBS Name", "Your BBS #",
 "Your Sex", "Your Age", and the highlight of this exe...
 "Be President Check Yes? [ ] No? [ ]" This is his way of asking
 you if you would like to run for "President of RISA." 
 
 What an esteemed title that would be! Oh, how I desire to be known
 as "President of the Rhode Island Sysops Association." I can see my
 name in lights...
 
 Well, if this thing goes anywhere, it's fairly obvious one of the larger
 "professional" ego maniacs will proclaim this title for themselves. 
 
 Now, lets do some further analysis on WHY he's attempting to form RISA.
 
 To remove "hackers" (or, as he wrote, to STOP them from being removed! heh
 heh!) Hackers? I don't see any hackers. I see some rather odd individuals
 who get kicks out of "disturbing the peace" (?) on BBSes, but certainly
 no evil, malicious hackers, as he would like to make it seem.
 
 RISA is an attempt to be at the "Anti-RICUS." He sees dozens of people
 flocking in our direction and is getting jealous of it all. Thanks for the
 attention, Howie, I'm sure RISA is a force to be reckoned with.
 <yaaaaaaawwwn!>

 I was just informed that RISA has changed its name to MANS.

3: Telecom Gh0dZ
----------------

----------------------------
      The TeLec0m gh0d    
----------------------------
                 
             "You take a mortal man, and put him in control
              Watch him become a god, watch people's heads a roll..."
                                           - Megadeth

       Aren't you sick of annoying users/sysops who think they are gh0d? You
know, the LaMaHs who post messages like, "You suck cause you're not me, I know
eVeRyThInG ab0ut your b0ard, and I can cRaSh it uSiNg my gh0d knowledge of 
s00per KeWl backdoorz!" Don't ya hate that? I know as a sysop, it tends to be
a TAD bit annoying for some little shit to tell you that basically you know
nothing and you are "out of your league". So I've devised this file to help
my fellow sysops to determine what to do with a TeLec0m gh0d...

       First you have to be able to tell if you have a TeLec0m gh0d on your
hands or not...so here's a little list...

1) The user leaves messages (public or private, usually both) threatening you
   if he/she doesn't get high access, they'll crash the board.

2) The user leaves messages (public) saying, "Kiss my ass, I am here! I will
   run this board, or challenge it to a war!" or something along those lines

3) The LaMaH tries to convince you he knows all these s00per KeWl backdoors
   and that he/she is best friends with the author of your BBS program

4) He tries to humiliate (usually failing) users or the sysop...

5) And of course, the LaMaH actually tries crashing your board

       If you have a user who matches anyone of these, or all of these, or
maybe just some. Most likely you have a TeLec0m gh0d on your hands...and 
with that gh0d comes his/hers HUGE gh0d eg0! So here's what you can do to 
"cut that eg0 down to size"

1) Find out where the gh0d lives and cut his/her phone lines...I personally
   like this one!

2) Take squinky's course on Stealing a Sysop's computer, of course it can be
   anybody's computer in this case...

3) If the gh0d is a sysop, call his/her board, find out what program gh0d's
   using, find out as MUCH as you can about that program (including s00per
   KeWl backdoors) and crash it

4) If he's a sysop, and you have connections with authors of BBS's (like you
   call Alpha sites or whatever) Hex edit a few messages and start a Author
   war, where your gh0d's board will definetly get taken away by that 
   program's author

5) Or you can just lock the gh0d out, and make sure he/she never calls ANY 
   boards in the state again!

       All these choices will most likely cut down that huge eg0 of that 
gh0d's. Make up your own plan, or use something up there. Choice is yours.
And if all fails, just find out where the gh0d lives and pummel 'em...heh
Good luck!
                                             
                                                /\/\orloc|<

Squinky Phile # 5 -=-=-=-=- Warning the Masses
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well folks, it appears our little hobby has once again been raped by ignorance
and stupidity. A certain local area sysop, who shall remain nameless, has 
started an Anti-hack group, calling RICUS a hack/phreak/pirate group. I can not
speak for the individual memembers of RICUS, but I can speak for the group in 
saying that RICUS(as a group) has never in ANY shape way or form, hacked, 
phreaked, or pirated software. Lies like this can ruin reputations, cost 
people jobs, and other nastyness. I do not believe that any RICUS memembers 
are involved in any illegal computer fraud activites. Nor do I believe that 
the Anti-hack group which has formed has any HARD evidence. Most likely 
rumors and just jealousy have spawned such lies. I certainly hope the BBS 
comunity can see the falsehood in these tales. Otherwise Telecom is in a 
sadder state than I thought it was. I personally challenge those who makes 
these accusitions to show evidence of them. Show me where you have seen a RICUS
release of pirated software. Show me where you have seen RICUS take claim for 
hacking. Show me where you have seen RICUS release K0dez and other phreaking 
information. Truth is, you CAN NOT. You have no evidence what-so-ever. I have 
heard that *I* am being blamed for hacking the board of the head of this new 
group. I would like to say in response for this, that, *I* have no idea 
what-so-ever on how to go about hacking a bbs, let alone crashing one. If 
such an activity was done under my account, I would like to be informed. 
Otherwise, keep your acusations where they belong, in the trash can.

 Well, looks like there's a LOT of systems in this little state of ours.
Have fun, and remember... The RICUS Motto: It's only a hobby!
(Seems we take that motto more to heart than those other guys!)

 I took the RIBBS list, ran it through a program, and made this.
 Great, isn't it?

 We know lots of the systems up there suck, but we're not gonna say which
ones. We leave that to you, the caller, to decide.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7: School BBSes
---------------
 Lately, we've been informed of numerous BBSes, run by schools. Primarily these
are junior high and high schools. Take a look at the BBS list above for the
numbers to some of them.

 Now, this wouldn't be bad in itself. Afterall, getting more kids involved
in telecom is great. However, take a look at the software these boards are run
on.

 Yes, that's right... Procomm Plus Host Mode! It is truly sad. I mean, if
you're going to dedicate a phone line to a BBS, atleast put it up on something
usable. Put it up on Telegard, Renegade, anything.. but not the host mode to
a term program! 

 Then, these boards are being used for rediculous things like sending messages
back in forth ("pen pal letters") for a French class. Now, come on people, if
they're going to put up a public BBS which ANYONE can dial into, atleast use
it for a decent purpose. You can write pen pal letters in a word processor,
even.

 Why not try and give these people recommendations on how to improve, what
software to run, how to set it up, etc.? These boards and the potential users
they could provide could be an asset to the BBS community in general.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8: Closing
---------- 

  The next issues of the RICUS t-file may take on a new format. Instead of one
 large text file, it may be split into many small ones, like those great
 Cult of the Dead Cow text files, who we all greatly admire! Why? Well,
 it saves the effort of putting them into one large file. Besides, having
 lots of small ones looks better than having a few large ones. Still, this
 new format isn't definite yet. 
   
  As Squinky said, RICUS as a GROUP does very little. ALL it does is make
 the text files that are in the RICUSxxx.TXT. What individual members do
 are *not* done in the name of the group and are not of our concern.
 
  If you have a problem with an _individual_ in the group, take it up with
 that INDIVIDUAL and not the group as a whole.
 
  Remember, it's only a hobby! <grin>
