         | CBI Using/Report Reading |
         +--------------------------+

I know there are many files written on CBI's but i really didnt find any really
usefull cause they didnt go into real detail so i decided i write this little
article for begginers on CBI's.  There are five service's available to cbi
users They include Arcofile, Arcofile-Plus, Safe-Scan, DTEC, and a On-Line
Directory. Here are some meanings of what all those abrv. on CBI's mean:

There are many extensions you can add ALWAYS add DFZ
for example:
xxxyyxxxx-yx,user,DFZ.
where it says user type any old names it makes it look more authentic

if you type that extension you will get the persons fone # at the end of the
credit report.

DTEC-XXX-XX-XXXX.<Ctrl S><CR>

Getting the EXPIRATION DATE from the EQUIFAX Report..

 This is an important task if one is to use the information to card himself
 or herself something. To obtain the correct EXPIRATION DATE you must use
 our method.  Everyone tells you to add two years to the RPTD column but they
 are wrong.

 First you need a working credit card validator. Here is one I have had, but
 it is also in the RL (Renegade Legion) file.

 Dialup:1+800+554-2265
        Bank:     1067 #
        Merchant: 52 #
        Type:     xx #  (10 = MC / 20 = Visa)
        Amount:   100 # (1.00)
        Exp. Date:0193 #

  Alright.. Now look at the column labeled OPND. Take the Month from that and
  write that down. That is your month for the EXP Date. Now look at the RPTD
  column. Take that year and write it down.  That is your "could be" year..
  If the card is EXPIRED already add two years two it. Call the Credit Card
  Validator and try it. If it doesnt work, then change the EXP and only add
  one year to the orginal date.. Some peoples visa/mastercard are an EVEN
  year while others are ODD.. If the even one doesnt work then it is the
  ODD..

  Basically that is all you need too know about CBI to use it to your benifeit.
  Now have fun and DO NOT CALL IT STAIGHT! Call it thru Tymnet or Some other
  type of OD system.
