 "HORNET" is the name of an FTP site on the internet.  It is a place where
 people upload and download files.  However, HORNET has grown much larger
 since it was first created 2.5 years ago by Dan Wright.  Now HORNET
 releases a weekly newsletter called DemoNews, and is starting to offer other
 services.  HORNET specializes in the "demo scene", and files that are re-
 lated to demos, coding, music, or graphics are welcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What a week!  This issue of DemoNews took almost my entire Saturday to put
 together, and we have a lot of great articles for your reading enjoyment.

 This week, I lost contact with Denthor.  His account has bounced mail since
 last Monday, and I have no idea what is up.  If anyone knows what the deal
 is, please let me know.

 On Monday night, I totally lost the ability to access HORNET.  It appears as
 though the official system administrator at the University of Florida (where
 HORNET is at) saw lots of new people logging into the dmw (Demo maintainer)
 account.  However, those were just the people that I have asked to help out
 with HORNET and did not have any malicious intent.  I only discovered that
 this was the reason on Wednesday.  Until that point, Dan and I had thought
 that someone might have cracked into the account and changed the passwords.

 While the situation has been resolved, it did remind me of the potential
 danger in allowing so many people access to HORNET.  As a result, security
 is much more strict and very few people can now get into the Demo Maintainer
 account.

 On a side note, has anyone heard from Otto Chrons in a while?  It used to be
 that at least one new version of DMP would be released each week.  Now I
 think its been several months.  If have any information, please let me know.

 I am heading into exam week here at the University of Akron, so next week's
 DemoNews might be a bit skimpy.  Ryan's school schedule is running parallel
 to mine, so I'm hoping we can get a few articles from other sources.

                     (Interview with Vic/AcmE by Snowman)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week, I have been fortunate enough to get an interview with Vic/AcmE.
 We had a bit of difficulty in deciding a time when we could both be online.
 Vic lives in The Netherlands and is 8 hours ahead of me.  Despite all of
 the difficulties, I am pleased with how things turned out.

 There are two factors making this interview a bit odd.  First, I am heading
 into exam week, and the stress is causing me to behave a bit strangely.
 Second, it was already 23:25 (for Vic) when we STARTED the interview.  He
 had just finished writing his article for Imphobia 9 and was a little tired.

 If I had given this interview to Ryan Cramer to proof ahead of time, he
 would likely have told me to cut out a few parts.  So if you are a true
 'professional' and would find a silly interview beneath you, then stop
 reading about halfway through.

 SM = Christopher G. Mann    - [Snowman/HORNET] - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
 VC = Victor Van Vlaardingen - [Vic/AcmE]       - v932546@si.hhs.nl
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [start of interview: December 8, 1994, 22:25GMT]

 SM: Hello, how are you doing?

 VC: Hello, and I'm doing, great.  Especially now, when talking to someone
     at the other side of the earth; LIVE!

 SM: Yes, I believe that you are 8 hours ahead of me.  But, on with the
     interview... First, how did AcmE form and who are its current members?

 VC: Well, at about two years ago, a coder and designer/graphician came
     together and thought it would be a cool idea to form a demo group. Then
     they made a little intro called AcmE.  They asked for some people to
     join them since they were with only two men.

     When I read this text, I was just a beginning musician, but I had the
     guts to deliver a module to them.  They thought it wasn't THAT GOOD,
     but they really needed a musician.  So, when time passes, everyone
     became better and better.

     Then we made another intro for the Bizarre-party here in holland. At
     the party, we met a lot of people, and we also ran into a coder named
     Laserdance.  He competed also in the intro-compo, and became second
     after us.  We thought he was kind of cool and so wo asked him to join
     forces with us.  He was honored to do so.  By that time we were a group
     of 5, so I just forgot to mention one person: MailMan. He joined us in
     the earlier days, before the party. He is a graphician.

     I think I also should mention the name of PolyTracker's coder: 
     LoneRanger.  He was, together with Aap, one of the two who started 
     AcmE. 

     Later we also met SimStim and Ricochet, respectively a coder and a
     graphician.  So We had a complete demo group.  Unfortunately Laserdance
     stepped out of acme lately, so that leaves us with euhm, 7 people (did
     I count that correctly).

 SM: I lost count.  :)  What other productions have you done in the past two
     years?

 VC: Well, here's a list: Mental Masturbation, Blue Steel demo, D.O.A.,
     Planet Earth intro and the last but certainly not least: Peace.  Also,
     we have released an adlib player. (An adjusted SADT-player, originally
     coded by S!P).  And I've released some modules.  Maybe the most known
     one is Clairvoyence which we made a little production of.  I think
     that's about it.

 SM: Well, I loved the song in Clair (Clairvoyence).  If I recall correctly,
     there was mention in the intro that you had used AcmE's own tracker and
     that some of the effects were a bit odd.  Would you elaborate on that?

 VC: Well, some effects we use can only be used on the GUS.  Like reverse
     play, bilooped samples, 16-bit.  Now I know that some of those CAN be
     done on a SB(Pro), but it would give a lot of problems, like it would
     need a lot of CPU-time.  So, since the GUS is a very fast soundcard,
     and since it has 32 channels, it's simply the best card to make music
     with. SB is not a standard for us anymore.  Therefore we decided to
     implement effects that cannot easily be supported by any other
     soundcard.

 SM: Now, I was very impressed with your GUS support in your productions,
     and it seems that your group has a good tracker to work with.  Why then
     did you release an Adlib player?

 VC: AH!, that was in the OLD days, when the GUS was only a dream. We all
     had a SB(Pro) and we didn't know any better.  AND, we needed an adlib
     player for a little BBS-intro for BLue Steel, our former HQ.

 SM: Do all members of AcmE live in the Netherlands?

 VC: Hm, well all the current members do. We have had a member in
     South-Africa (a graphician), but we kinda lost contact with him, and it
     was too difficult to discuss the design of a demo with him, so he
     stepped out of AcmE.

 SM: How do you plan and design a demo in AcmE?

 VC: Well, all the former demos have been designed mostly by Aap.  He's our
     main designer. In those former days, everything was a bit messy: There
     was a design paper, but it never ended the way we wanted to. I always
     made a song in advance and the rest of the group adjusted the demo to
     it.

     Now we thought that that was not good enough for AcmE, so now, for the
     Party '94, we wanted to do it differently.  First we made the design
     (for THE Party) on paper. Then all the effect we could think of are
     discussed with the coders.  Some effects couldn't be done, because they
     simply couldn't be done (Sounds like the logic of Spock), but with the
     rest, that could be made, we finished the design of the demo.

     Then when all the effects are made, the coders link them together and
     give them to me.  Then I start to make some music, that fits with the
     demo. We thought that this is the best way of making a demo. And
     hopefully we'll see that when we're at the party!

 SM: I'd like to talk about the party in a second.  But first I wanted to
     ask you: what is your official and un-official role in AcmE?

 VC: Uhm, Official: Musician.  Unofficial: Well, lately I start to do some
     PR and design because Aap is getting busier all the time. But these
     items are no real big roles in AcmE.  Aap and I simply discuss thing
     about the demo and other things like getting t-shirts for The Party and
     stuff.

 SM: OK, you've hinted about the party several times now.  :)  What does
     AcmE have planned?

 VC: Ah, we're going to compete with a demo and all the usual stuff like
     music and graphix.  And that's about it I guess.

 SM: How close are you to finishing up the demo?

 VC: HAHAHA, We're not even a little close. I haven't started on making
     ANYTHING for the demo yet. I just hope it doesn't end up like DOA.

 SM: Mabey some last minute coding at the party itself?  :)  What other
     groups does AcmE have ties with?

 VC: euhm, well, we're going to release a chart-mag together with Hypnosis.
     This is going to be COOL!  And look at what I've written here CHARTS!
     No complete stories, just CHART, with VERY cool graphix and VERY cool
     music! The graphics and music will be done by someone else in every
     issue. People like PL and Zodiak have already applied to do some stuff.

 SM: This is a bit off the subject, but how has the weather been lately? (I
     might not put this in the interview, but I'm trying to think of some
     odd attention-getting things. :))

 VC: (you're absolutely right. People need to read some funny things so now
     and then.)

     The weather is, how shall we say that in a decent way: showers, logs
     are breaking off the trees, (serious, a couple of meters away from my
     home) and elephants flying through the air. The weather SUCKS! (Autumn
     I guess...)

 SM: What do you think about the demo scene in the USA?  (this is not to be
     a slam-fest) :)

 VC: yeah, wel, uhm, aah, wel, Tran is pretty cool, and you have some cool
     musicians, but for the size of the states, you may have some more
     talent. Don't you agree?

 SM: Yes.  It often frustrates me that, for as large as the USA is, that
     there isn't more action.  I have been at a loss for sometime as to why
     this is...

 SM: Hmmm, when I think Netherlands, I picture windmills and tulips...

 VC: Ahm, you're right, they do exist here.  But can you imagine a bus full
     with Hollanders arriving at the party with their tulips and wooden
     shoes?

 SM: Do you celebrate Christmas?

 VC: Me personally?

 SM: No, people in the Netherlands...

 VC: Jep, we do. And every year we do it more. Do you know "Sinterklaas?" or
     your version Santa Claus?

 SM: Yes, I am familiar with the gentleman you refer to.

 VC: oke, well, that used to be our december partyday (the 5th). But he's
     fading away now, and christmas is getting more and more important for
     all the people around here. They find it more fun, but don't ask me
     why...

 SM: Hmm.  I seem to remember childhood stories of how you either get candy
     or a piece of coal in your wooden shoes at Christmas, depending on how
     you behaved during the year.  Which do you think you will get this
     year?

 VC: Well, my parents are watching this now, so I will not answer the
     question.

 SM: :)  Hello Mr. and Mrs. Vic.

 VC: hello back.

 SM: This conversation is becoming more and more odd, but should make for
     some good reading in DemoNews... :)

 VC: Think so, when DemoNews is become odd as well, I think more people will
     read it and subscribe themselves to receive it every Sunday morning.

 SM: I just checked a little while ago, and found that we are up more than
     105 subscribers since last Saturday!  Does anybody talk about DemoNews
     in the Netherlands?

 VC: Well, We in the demo scene definitely do. When I talk with Aap on
     sunday, he always mentions something cool in DemoNews. And I will talk
     about it the with The Rew, and The Rew talks about it with... etc. Its
     like a rabbit on the loose...

 SM: REW asked me to do an article for Imphobia.  Its only half done, and
     I'm supposed to have it to him by the end of this week...

     Lately, there has been a lot of negative attention on HORNET for
     removing the ANSI from the site.  What do you personally think about
     the ANSI scene?

 VC: hmm, IS THERE AN ANSI SCENE? I know some people that are dedicated to
     making ansi's but I believe I only know two people who do so...

 SM: Do you think that ANSI should be considered part of the demo scene as a
     whole?

 VC: Well, In demo's you do not see ansies, normally spoken that is, but
     where DO you see ansi's: in BBS's.  My opinion is to make it a bbs
     scene or something.  Demos are about coding, and art (oops, caught
     myself, ansi is a kind of art).  Was there a big attention to the ansi
     area at HORNET?

 SM: Well, we used to get quite a bit of ANSI uploaded.  However, I did a
     check to see how much room it was eating up.  I think it was in the
     neighborhood of 70 megs.  We only have 340 to work with, and we were
     running out of space quite a bit.  In addition, people kept making new
     directories under /incoming/ansi and putting hard-to-remove files in
     there.  These two factors led me to decide to remove it.  I am starting
     to regret that decision.  :(

 VC: Hm, wel, if there is so much attention to the ansi scene/site, then
     maybe you should re-open it and just delete all the ansi's older then
     let's say 4 weeks.  I guess everyone who wants to see them, has them,
     and they will be happy as well.  You have to serve the customers,
     right...

 SM: Yes, I guess.  Re-instating limited-term ANSI on HORNET is a
     possibility.  Hmmm...  Did you have anything to do with the
     coding/design in Blue Steel?

 VC: EUhm, yeah, I made an adlib tune.

 SM: I was wondering.  There was one section at the end that had the
     spinning dot-sphere.  It seemed as though that might have been put in
     there just because the music still had more to go.  Is this true?

 VC: wait a sec, parents just leaving, GOD, They were making we CRAZY!!!!!!!

 SM: ok

 VC: Wait, you mean the demo.  We've also made this bbs-intro I've already
     mentioned before.  That's what the adlib shit was there for.  The music
     for Blue Steel the demo was of course a module.  And yes, The meaning
     of the end at the demo, was indeed to let the people think it's over,
     but then it wasn't. We got more of those reactions, and people liked
     it...

 SM: Don't get me wrong.  I really liked the effect that the demo had.  It
     was very relaxing.  I have to ask though, where did you get those bird
     samples from the beginning of the song?

 VC: let me think.. I believe I ripped it out of a patch, but that might
     just be not true.  It could be a sample I got from Aap, but I didn't
     make it myself, not this one :-(

 SM: Hmmm...  Do you have any pets?

 VC: Jep, I have two hamsters; A male and..... female.  They are currently
     in production again... Last nest contained 12 little ugly hamsters. So
     now and then I simply have to separate them, 'coz, if I don't the house
     will be stamped with hamsters!  But, I adore them, I think they are the
     sweetest beings on the earth.

 SM: I used to have several hamsters.  However, they all died.  Have you
     ever considered getting the female fixed so she can't breed?

 VC: Yeah I have, but first of all, I think that is really an evil thing to
     do. Would YOU like to be CASTRATED if you didn't want it to?  Second, I
     love those ugly young hammies as well...

 SM: Well, I would think that fixing the female would be easier than trying
     to convince the male to use birth control...

 VC: Yeah, I tried that, he wouldn't listen to me, but as I said, I don't
     mind, and I have an address where I can leave the new hamsters, so
     that's no problem for me...

 SM: While we are talking about animals:  In the USA, we have 'hunting
     season' where people go out with shotguns and blow away little fluffy
     dear.  Do you have a similar thing in the Netherlands?

 VC: Hm, I think there are people who do so, but we do not have a particular
     season for it.  Except now with christmas; there are hundreds of
     rabbits living here in the area, and they are shot for.... DINNER!!

 SM: How old are you and are you in school?

 VC: I am 19 and I study "informatica", computer programming. I don't know
     the word for that in english.

 SM: networking?

 VC: ehm, well, Not really networking, that's what The Rew does, I make
     programs like databases for companies. Pl

[and with a talk daemon crash, Vic was gone...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lots of people have been re-uploading files in the /incoming/music
 directory on hornet that were uploaded in previous weeks. Please stop
 uploading duplicates. If a file that you have put into the incoming
 directory is not there, it has been moved to its proper directory. You can
 always tell where files have been moved to by checking the latest issue of
 DemoNews. There is no reason to put it back on the ftp site! :)

 If you have any questions, feel free to send me email as I manage the

((Section 3...Editorial))            <BY>        Christopher G. Mann (Snowman)
==============================================================================
                            (A Defense of Demoscene)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In 1595, Sir Philip Sidney published "The Defence of Poesy."  At the time,
 poetry had been considered by many to be a wasteful activity.  The Norton
 Anthology of English Literature states "In this long essay Sidney
 systematically defends poetry (his term for all imaginative literature)
 against its attackers and, in the process, greatly exalts the role of the
 poet and the moral value of poetry."

 In a similar vain, I here attempt to justify why the demo scene is a
 legitimate activity.  Below I present five major advantages.

 Demo groups, a fundamental structure in the demo world, are comprised of
 four major classifications of people: coders, musicians, artists, and
 organizers.  As in the business environment, each member has a specific
 role and each must perform their own duties for the benefit of the group.
 Team cooperation is a skill that most people must acquire when entering the
 job market, and demo groups provide experience in this.

 Achieving success in the demo scene generally requires years of work. Even
 if an individual is extremely talented in one of the four major areas
 aforementioned, it still takes a great deal of time to learn how to use the
 tools needed.  Mozart, The Beetles, or even Jimmy Hendrix would be hard
 pressed to sit down in front of Fast Tracker ][ and compose a module.
 Similarly, Michelangelo would be lost with a ray tracer, and da Vinci would
 probably cut off one of the mouse buttons before learning how to utilize
 the intricacies of Corel Draw.  There is a certain amount of supplementary
 knowledge required about "how things work" before an individual can become
 productive.  That extra knowledge, gained in the demo scene, can influence
 people to produce art like no other.

 On a more financially-aware level, the demo scene often leads to commercial
 opportunities.  Take for example Future Crew or Triton; both produced
 multimedia advertisements for well known companies.  Skills learned in the
 demo scene are often directly applicable to the business environment.  Even
 if an individual is hired for a job without listing the "demo scene" as a
 qualification, the experience that person has gained will almost certainly
 complement their production and make them a more valued employee.

 Even being aware of the demo scene's existence generally indicates that an
 individual has learned a fair amount about computers.  Understanding the
 basic components of a computer, its operating system, and simple terminal
 commands are all required just to obtain a demo.  Most people in the scene
 have more than a passing knowledge of computers, and in fact, many go on to
 learn a frightening amount about their respective areas.  One aspect of
 this relates back to the team-environment mentioned earlier: even if an
 individual does not have time to learn something they need, there will
 always be other people and contacts who can provide the information.  In
 that respect, the demo scene is a vast collection of people sharing
 knowledge.

 Perhaps the best "real world" advantage of the demo scene is that it does,
 in effect, allow one to understand the "real world."  For the most part,
 people in the scene can not function as well when limited to contact only
 with their own section of Earth.  With increasing communications
 technology, it is fairly easy to chat or mail someone on the other side of
 the world.  This also means that a lot of social customs and personal
 opinions, once considered solid and universal foundations, are forever
 thought of differently.  More than knowledge, skills, or talent, this can
 effect who a person IS for the rest of their life.

 In summary, participating in the demo scene is an activity that should be
 highly encouraged.  Now at least, when parents criticize their sons and
 daughters for spending so much time in front of the computer, those sons and
 daughters can present some concrete justification to their parents.  For
 those who no longer live with their parents, this essay may act as sort of a
 warm reassurance that their time spent is worthwhile.  The demo scene is an
 international family of people striving to make their lives better, and I for
 one am happy to be a part.

    The Making of NAID / Apraxia   by:  William Le (The Veritech Knight)
                                   and  Etienne Caron (Mr. Khan)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Greetz, William here. Christopher G. asked me to write a little
         article so that Everyone could know a bit more about the NAID
         team and how the project got started.


 Veritech Knight >  Okay, we are now live. Joining us now is Mr. Khan,
                    the other Main organizer. Say hi to everyone.:)

 Mr. Khan >         Hi everybody. Well, here it is, our first public
                    address concerning the Naid / Apraxia demoparty.
                    Hmm... Well, how'bout explaining to everyone how
                    we got the idea?

 VK >
       Good idea. One sunny afternoon, we were all talking about ASM 94,
       and how we wanted oh so much to go. But, still, for students on a
       budget, things don't always work that way. Mr. Khan was looking for
       some sort of good administration project, the usual projects being
       volleyball competitions, trivia games and the like, in other words,
       boring stuff. And then inspiration came : "A demoparty! God!
       With all the stuff we have access to in this college, it would be...
       it would be... it WILL be Awesome!!!"

       We sat down the whole lot of us (Me,Khan and Eric(Midnight Sun)),
       and tried to think of a name. Well we finally took out the ole'
       dictionnary, threw it on the ground, and looked at the page that was
       all crumpled up. We saw "Apraxia" (we were looking for something with
       an X, but something non-killer like "X-terminator" :) ) , and the
       definition is "State of total paralysis, where only the nervous
       system keeps working.".

 MK >  Something like the perfect couch potato, if you will.

 VK >  In other words, "You're senses are still there but the body don't
       work no more".

 MK >  So, VK, what should we add. I mean, was it all this simple?

 VK >  Hell no!

 MK >  Hell is right! I remember we were allways walking around the
       school with the same question:

       "Yeah, it WILL be a resounding success... If we get the school to
       swallow it! Man! Think about it. We're gonna come up to them and
       say : `Hi there Mr. Principal. Well, here's how it goes. We want
       a place in your school for 1000 computer freaks, make 'em stay up
       all night, play music and strange little computer programs on a
       HUGE big screen, with a sound system that will be too loud, and
       such other type of madness'.'
       That'll take some heavy convincing man. Very heavy..."

       Thus started... The paper chase.

 VK >  I'd like to point out, that to make this dream come true for all
       of us organizers, we worked and *are* working really really hard.
       You know, the"hey,-don't-I-have-an-exam-tommorow" type of work.
       So be at the party and enjoy the results with us!!

 MK >  ..So after 2 months of parperwork, we had done it! They said yes.
       Ok, we used every dirty trick in the book, but we even convinced
       THEM that it would be hot!

 VK >  BTW, the main administrators for student activities are now
       certified demo freaks. Thus answering an age old question. Yes, it
       IS contagious. :)

 MK >  So, what else ya think people would like to know about? Hey! I
       know, let's tell them about us. Imagine you're on the Tonight show.
       I'm Dave, <But not as funny looking :) >. So tell us about yourself.

 VK >  Well, My passion for demos and the demo scene started during the
       '92 year, when I met Eric (Midnight Sun, aka "Med", as in "Club Med",
       but without the Club). The first demo I ever saw was Cronologia by
       Cascada, and I was hooked from that day on. A few months later we
       saw Future Crew's Unreal for the first time and we both got bit by
       the "We-HAVE-to-go-to-assembly" bug. We both carried the dream into
       our CEGEP school years (that's the two years before University here
       in Quebec). Well since then, many demo-viewing filled nights have
       past, and I must tap myself on the shoulder for being smart enough
       to open a demo oriented board (-> getting allll the wonderfull demos
       on my own computer is fun :> ).
       So there ya go. Two certified demo freaks. Which reminds me, when we
       first saw the "Dolby Surround" logo in FC's 2nd reality, we went out
       and bought ourselves a dolby surround amp, and let me tell you folks
       that we impressed quite a few people with it :>, plus, it'll be one
       of the amps driving the sound for the NAID...

       So, Dave :) , do tell us how you met your first demo :)

 MK >  Well, my process of addiction to demos was kinda special. I got
       addicted, got out of it for 6 years, got a life :) and then came
       back to it when I saw that getting a life was not all that fun. :>
       First demo : C-64, music text display explaining rules of a game.
       Man, that was cool. Then I saw my first scrollys, and that was
       also fascinating... and after my sabatical, my next computer was
       an Atari ST. By that time I was done for life. Got my PC last year,
       I still love it and always will. You have to understand, in our
       neck of the woods, it was'nt always easy to get in touch with people
       who had a similar interest. But new technologies arose, the BBS
       scene in Montreal got bigger, and the rest will go down in history :>

       Now, let's talk about NAID. Here goes : You all saw the text-file.
       You all know what is about to happen. Yup, a big demo-party, right
       over here on our side of that big Atlantic puddle. You might
       actually wonder how we get to pull it off, seing that everyone
       this year seems to be talking about organizing something like this.
       Well people, the recipe is kinda simple, but hard to implement :
       Convince your school, find tallented, dedicated and a professional
       kind of team, and you're off.
       We got both. Our school's computer students association is in on the
       Naid, teachers and administrators of the school find in it something
       totally new and exciting, in short, karma is on our side for now,
       and it's way to late to stop :>

       Well people, we sure hope we got your attention. This party is gonna
       happen on the 15th and 16th of April 95, demofreaks or not, come in
       great numbers and bask in the sheer glow of SUPPA DEMO MADNESS! :>

 VK>   Well that's it for the both of us.. one last thing before the
       usual "too-many" greetz..


                    BE THERE AND DIE , OR BE NOWHERE AND CRY!


 Don't forget to check the new infofile and contact us!


 Da greetz:

                  Coluche, Francois dion, Robert Brien, Andree Bouchard,

                  (the Barney killer), Mr. Mister, Coluche, Apenis <g>,
                  Struk, Deverox and the rest of the NAID team, all the
                  users on my board, and Star (xx).  Quick "Hi"'s to
                  everyone who has allready showed an interest and emailed
                  me <Jackie,Berky,Jason,etc.,and Lily -> You got ticket
                  number 00001 :) >

 Thanx go out to: CEM for making this possible, Christopher G. Mann, and
 the whole scene for over 2 years of fun and more to come...

 See ya at Da Party !

==============================================================================
 This week we've got an excellent music section consisting of an interview
 with C.C.Catch from Renaissance and an extensive review of the new
 ScreamTracker 3.2 which was released this week! The interview with
 C.C.Catch starts out with the history of how I got to know him and a look
 at the many productions which he has been involved in. The interview isn't
 a really long one, as we were both limited on time, but I think you'll
 find it to be some great reading! You'll also get to learn how Renaissance
 started! :) The next article is an in-depth review of the new
 ScreamTracker 3.2. If your a musician, or even if your not, be sure to
 read it! Its got some really useful information and comments on this
 nice update to the legendary ScreamTracker ]I[. Enjoy...

 INTERVIEW: C.C.Catch of Renaissance                    [Music Article 1 of 2]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This week, we have an interview with C.C.Catch of Renaissance! C.C. is one
 of the most famous musicians in the entire PC demoscene, and he has been
 since the very beginnings when some of the early Renaissance demos were
 released. I know that many of the musicians in the scene today were very
 inspired and influenced by his work, including myself. C.C.Catch is one of
 the founding musicians in the demoscene and he's been involved with it
 since the time when you could count the number of released demos with the
 fingers on your right hand. :)

 History
 ~~~~~~~
 Amnesia was released about the same time that I bought my first soundcard
 (an SBPro). Being pretty excited about my new soundcard, I called all of
 the BBSs to try and find stuff to show it off. I downloaded a bunch of
 MODs and CMF files and such. Eventually, I discovered demos. One of the
 first ones I found was something called RBGDEMO2. I was totally amazed by
 this demo and could not believe how incredible it was! I decided to call
 the BBS that was listed in the ending screen for this demo. This BBS
 turned out to be the former Renaissance WHQ called The Sound Barrier. Once
 I got onto the Sound Barrier, I looked around for other productions from
 this group called Renaissance. There was one huge demo called Amnesia. I
 figured that if Amnesia was anywhere near as cool as RBGDEMO2, it would be
 well worth the download and the long distance $$ that I was paying for
 the call!

 Amnesia
 ~~~~~~~
 I watched Amnesia, and I was TOTALLY in AWE! I had no idea my computer was
 capable of this sort of thing. I was most impressed by the music in the
 demo by C.C.Catch and Mosaic. I will never forget the first time I watched
 Amnesia... I had discovered a piece of artwork unlike any other.

 The next day, I desperatly tried to call through to the Sound Barrier to
 ask these people how the hell they did that! I sent messages to C.C.Catch,
 Daredevil, Tran, and Mosaic telling them how cool I thought that demo was.
 I got a really nice reply from C.C.Catch who seemed truly thrilled about
 how much I liked his music. Mosaic apparently had already left Renaissance
 at that time, so I could not talk to him there, but I tried!

 The Sound Barrier
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Over the next few months, I kept in contact with C.C.Catch. I thought it
 was pretty cool, talking to a celebrity such as him! I kept downloading
 more of his music and really gained a lot of respect for his stuff. I
 eventually decided that I wanted to learn how to get into this music, he
 got me started. He gave me lots of valuable tips on how to track
 music, and gave me tons of feedback on my first attempts at music. I had
 no musical background at all and I got really frustrated with it, but he
 kept me going. Daredevil also sent me some positive feedback and
 constructive criticism. I would never have gotten started in music had it
 not been for C.C.Catch and Daredevil.

 C.C.Catch's Involvement in the Demoscene
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 As a result, I'm very happy to do this interview with C.C.Catch. He has
 probably been involved with more demo scene productions then any other
 musician in the entire scene. ALL of his music is great, and he has always
 paid a LOT of attention to detail in his music, it shows! C.C.Catch also
 does work for computer games. He has done the music for two hit games
 called Zone66 and One Must Fall which are distributed by Epic Megagames.
 C.C. is also very versatile in the styles of music that he can do; his
 style ranges from beautiful Chinese music to hard hitting techno songs,
 and more! I look forward to hearing what he does in the future!

 It would be impossible to print a complete discograpy of C.C.Catch's work
 as he has done SO MUCH stuff, but a partial listing of the major productions
 that he has done music for would include:

 Partial Listing of Productions with Music by C.C.Catch
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - All early Renaissance productions (RBGDEMO, RBGDEMO2, TDEMO, YARDEMO, etc)
 - Amnesia Megademo
 - Zone66 game by Tran from Epic Megagames
 - WorldCharts
 - Imphobia (multiple issues)
 - Epidemic Multigroup music disk
 - TONS of individual releases including STMs, MODs, 669s, & MTMs
 - Tran's HELL demo
 - Renaissance's NothingOn music disk
 - RMUZIK0 music disk
 - Kaeon game by Tran
 - DoWhackDo intro by WhiteShadow
 - Daretro intro by Daredevil
 - Epic Megagame's hit game called "One Must Fall"

 ...and thats just a PARTIAL listing!

 Where to find C.C.Catch's music
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 You can find a FEW pieces of music by C.C.Catch at:
 ftp.uwp.edu - /pub/msdos/demos/music/artists/cccatch

 Also try Hornet for some demos that he's been involved in:
 ftp.eng.ufl.edu - /pub/msdos/demos/groups/renaissance

 The best resource for his music is Data Connection BBS where I think we
 have just about every piece of music released by him. We also have all of
 the demos, intros, and other productions that he has been involved with.
 There is an advertisement for Data Connection in the advertisements
 section of this DemoNews. Hope you enjoy the interview!

 [start of interview: C.C.Catch / Renaissance]

 CC = C.C.Catch (aka Kenny Chou) of Renaissance - cccatch@escape.com
 RC = Ryan Cramer of Iguana/Renaissance         - rcramer1@osf1.gmu.edu
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RC: How old are you? Whats your current occupation and where are you
     located?

 CC: I'm 19 and in college. I goto that crappy Queens Community College
     in New York. :)

 RC: What equipment and software do you use for composing?

 CC: I'm *still* using MMEdit, but I think that I will try both ST 3.2 and
     FT2 in the future. There's more options in both of those (no offense
     to StarScream). ;)

     I get samples from my Korg O1/W, Roland SC55 (Sound Canvas), and
     Roland R8 (drum machine) ...depending on what I need for the specific
     song. Plus, I try to do some MIDI shit, but well... its annoying!

     I sample with either Triton's FastTracker 2 sample editor or
     Daredevil's beta (command line) GUS sampler.

 RC: What kind of music are you working on right now?

 CC: Ryan, I did a couple of patterns yesterday on a song, I better finish
     it before January 1st! :) Projects, hmm... Ray (Mosaic) is bugging me
     to contact Tim Sweeney from Epic Megagames and see if there's any job
     openings for a team effort. Besides that, nothing right now.

 RC: No doubt, you'd easily be able to get work from Epic considering
     you've already done music for two of their hit games. Has "One Must
     Fall" been profitable for you? Are you happy with how that worked out?

 CC: Yeah, I'm happy with One Must Fall. I got a nice direct pay, plus
     picked up a teeny percentage out of it. :) Plus, I play it a lot!

 RC: One Must Fall is an awesome game, I think its going to be one of
     Epic's best sellers. I'm addicted to it, and your music is great! Fits
     perfectly.

 CC: Thanks. :) Hope they contact me when they make a CD version...

 RC: Speaking of which, what do you think is the BEST music that you've
     done through the years? This can be a single song, or maybe a bunch,
     but what are your favorites?

 CC: Ryan, well I can't really name a favorite of mine, but... I liked the
     Virtual Reality song in our demo "Amnesia". :) God, the song matched
     perfectly, plus, it's actually complete. Gasp!

 RC: I always loved that song too, and the music from the RMUZIK0 music
     disk was classic as well!

 CC: I didn't get much response from people on those, but I liked 'em too.
     MELLOW! ZZZzzzzz... ;)

 RC: Well, on a related question, which productions have you most enjoyed
     doing music for?

 CC: Zone 66! It was the first game I got to do music on (excluding Kaeon),
     plus it got me into the Epic Megagames freelance list. :)

 RC: Musically, what do you think the future holds? Do you think maybe more
     game music, demo music, or what?

 CC: I think I better reach the January 1st deadline or else I'll get
     locked out of #trax on IRC. :)

     First off, you know Renaissance, we're lazy ass mofo's ... so demos
     will be pretty rare from us. Plus, I want to do game music. :)

 RC: When you first started composing, what sparked your interest in it? I
     remember you mentioned something about Dr. Awesome to me awhile back.

 CC: Dr. Awesome is awesome. =) When I first began, it seems he was the
     only good musician out there.

 RC: Can you tell us the story of how you got your alias, C.C.Catch?

 CC: C.C.Catch was a damn female singer! (I'm not a female of course, and
     I'm not gay either). Before I knew she was, uh.. female, I used the
     handle on elite boards. Then when I bought her tape, well, oops! :)

 RC: hehehe

 CC: I couldn't turn back, didn't want to change handles! :)

 RC: What was the best composing environment you ever used?

 CC: CDFM, rocks man! Its a cheesy tracker of course though, right Ryan?

 NOTE: CDFM is the tracker that uses 9 FM channels and 4 digital channels
 ----  which was used in Amnesia, Zone66, RMUZIK0, and other Renaissance
       demos. The tracker (which was written by Tran) was never publicly
       released.

 RC: The music created in there was great, it was so unique!

 CC: Yeah, I've got so many unfinished songs from CDFM that I never
     released, because there's no &$%^# player!

 RC: Well, we haven't heard a lot of music from you lately, what have you
     been doing?? :)

 CC: Nothing much ... Just playing MUD and MAGIC (but everyone knows
     that). Yesterday Ray (Mosaic) and I were whining about how sucky we
     are. hehe.

 RC: How did Renaissance start? I know that you were there from the
     beginning.

 CC: Well, I came up with the name "Renaissance", and a few months after
     Kaeon was made, Mosaic started talking about forming a demogroup.
     Mosaic called me while I was on the phone with Tran and he told me to
     ask Tran to join! I was reluctant, but I asked, and Tran joined!

     Then Tran asked Daredevil to join, and Daredevil asked Radioisotope,
     and thats where Renaissance started.

 RC: So you and Mosaic were the founding members of Renaissance?

 CC: Ryan, let the world know! Mosaic started Renaissance!
     Gasp!

 RC: How did you meet Tran?

 CC: Remember the game, Kaeon? Well, Tran wanted music for it, because his
     music was a bit cheesier then mine at the time. :) So he called me and
     asked, with that usual grumble of his.

 RC: Kenny, thanks a lot for doing this interview and taking the time to
     answer all of these questions. Are there any people that you'd like to
     greet or additional things that you'd like to say?

 CC: Hmm... Greets to Ryan, Necros, Draygen, Khyron, Baseface, Godface,
     Stalkah, Bchrome, Flossy ... uh man, too many people to greet.
     My Mom =), #trax ...THE WORLD!

 Hope that you enjoyed this weeks interview! We won't be having interviews
 every single issue, just because its kind of hard to get in contact with
 some of these people. :) But, next week, I am trying to get an interview
 with Purple Motion of Future Crew. I am hoping that will work out. Stay
 tuned!

 REVIEW: ScreamTracker 3.2 Upgrade                      [Music Article 2 of 2]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week, ScreamTracker 3.2 was released! There isn't really anything too
 exciting about ST 3.2, but for those diehard ST users, this is a great
 update to this popular tracking software. The previous version of Scream
 Tracker (version 3.01) was ridden with quite a few bugs; some pretty
 nasty, and others that weren't too bad. Nevertheless, there were enough
 that PSI decided to release a new "bugfix" version. After using ST 3.2 for
 a few hours here, I'm very happy to say that its definitly an improvement.

 The bugs that were in ST 3.01 never really hampered people from making
 great pieces of music in it, but I think that ST 3.2 makes this tracker
 a little more friendly. However, ST 3.2 is still not a bug-free program!
 One new bug that has been introduced is very obvious, and I'm surprised
 that it even exists! When loading a sample, I always get the message
 "Warning, Not Enough Memory Available (1024k GUS)". This happens on all
 samples that I load, no matter how small or large they are. This
 unnecessary warning message is VERY annoying, but luckily it does not
 conflict with the loading of samples. All of the samples still load up
 just fine. This is not a big problem, but I hope that PSI will fix this in
 the near future with a new bugfix version or a patch.

 Included with the Scream Tracker 3.2 package is a file called
 WHATSNEW.320. This file is basicly just a list of the bugs that were fixed
 and new features that were added. I'm not going to print all of them here,
 but I will go over a few of the new features that I found interesting. For
 a complete list of ST 3.2's new features, be sure to check out the
 WHATSNEW.320 file included with it.

 New features (partial listing)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 > Flip sample command - converts an Amiga sample to a PC sample and
 > vice versa. Text files have to be flipped after they are loaded into
 > memory so they can be viewed.

 Samples for tracked music come in both PC and Amiga formats. The only
 difference between the two formats is that the bytes are arranged
 differently. Scream Tracker 3 uses the PC format, as does MultiTracker
 and a few other programs. However, FastTracker uses Amiga style samples.
 Those that have experimented with both Fast Tracker 2 and Scream Tracker
 3 know that when you load a sample saved from ST3 into FT2, it will sound
 totally screwed up. Likewise when saving a sample in FT2 and loading it
 into ST3. This is a result of what I described above; the samples are in a
 different format.

 When your in FastTracker II, you can convert your sample and make it sound
 correctly by hitting the "CONV" button in the "S.E.Ext" (Extended Sample
 Editor) screen.

 In ScreamTracker 3.2, the new command that they have added is the ALT-A
 command, this will convert an Amiga sample to the proper PC sample format.
 This command is accessable only while in the Sample Window. One thing that
 I really like about ST 3.2 is that it tells you "Warning, this may be an
 Amiga sample, ALT-A will convert it" before you load it. This new sample
 conversion feature is very useful, and I know that I'm going to make use
 of it quite often. I'm somewhat surprised that this feature was not there
 from the very beginning.

 In ST 3.2, hitting ALT-V will let you view the current sample in a text
 mode viewer. This means that you could load text files as samples. Such
 text files could include information about your song, BBS ads, and such.
 In order to make one of these text files viewable, you have to convert it
 to an Amiga style sample by hitting ALT-A. Give it a try, its a pretty
 neat feature. I'm going to start including text in all of my songs. :)

 > Save sample without header (ALT-W) command.

 In the previous version of ST3, whenever you saved a sample, it would save
 it as a DP3 file. A DP3 file is a sample that includes various loop and
 fine tuning information at the beginning of the file. DP3 files are
 extremely useful when you only work with ST3, but if you are using ST3 to
 rip out samples for use in another tracking software, you would find that
 not many other trackers recognize DP3 files. When using another tracker,
 any sample that you loaded which was saved from ST3 would have an annoying
 click at the beginning of it. This click sound is just the raw non-sample
 data from the header of the DP3 file. Now that ST 3.2 includes the ability
 to save a sample WITHOUT the DP3 header, you will no longer run into this
 problem.

 ALT-W = Save sample without DP3 header: Use this when saving samples for
         use in other tracking programs.

 ALT-O = Save sample with DP3 header: Use this when saving samples for use
         in ST3 only.

 > Skip value of 0. (ALT-0)

 Usually when you hit a note in the pattern edit screen, the cursor moves
 down to the next position in the pattern. If you hit ALT-0, then when you
 hit a note, the cursor will stay in the same position until you manually
 move it with your arrow keys. This is useful for when your experimenting
 with different notes on a particular position in a pattern. It saves you
 the trouble of constantly hitting your up arrow to get back while your
 trying to find the right note. One such situation that you might find this
 useful is when you are experimenting with laying out chords.

 > A sample can now be cut at the loop end point in the instrument list.

 This sounds like a nice memory saving feature. It means that you could
 delete the unused sample data when your loop end is less than the sample
 length (assuming I understand this correctly). However, I haven't been
 able to figure out how to do this, any ideas?

 > Fine Vibrato command. (Four times more accurate than normal vibrato)

 Sometimes you just can't get the perfect vibrato with the standard vibrato
 command. The fine vibrato command will fix that, it gives you a little
 more control over the sound of your sample. I like it!

 > Set channel panning command. (Only on a GUS!)

 This is one of the best things about ST 3.2. Finally we can use panning
 while in ST3! Previously, you could use various panning commands, but you
 would never hear the result of them in the tracker. If you wanted to hear
 the result of your channel panning, you'd have to go play your song with
 another program like DMP. ST3's channels either were in non-stereo, or
 they were positioned to the left or to the right. Now, your channels can be
 panned in any of 16 positions! You can change the pan position of any
 channel by using the S8x command (where x = 0..F). However, its
 unfortunate that they did not implement the "Xxx" command which seems to be
 more commonly used for panning in most S3Ms that I have seen.

 > Channel default pan settings. (Only on a GUS!)

 In the F1 "Order List and Variables" screen, next to each of the channel
 number identifiers, there is an additional character field where you can
 specify the pan position for that individual channel. You can use a value
 of 0 through F, where 0 is all the way to the left, and F is all the way
 to the right.

 > Channel pan position visible on infopage. (Only on a GUS!)

 The channel pan position in the infopage is a little hard to find, and you
 *must* be in stereo mode for it to appear. The pan positions fields each
 consist of a single character in the range of 0..F. These appear right
 between the volume bars and the sample names, ie:

 ________________   ______________________
 |******        | 3 |02: Chord.Major
 |**********    | C |05: HiHat.Open
 |***           | 3 |07: TightBass
 |************* | C |01: BassDrum.echo
 |********      | F |05: KorgLead
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 ^^^
                 |||
            Pan positions

 > Gravis ultraclick removal by using 16, 24 or 32 GUS channels
 > (the more channels, the lower the sound quality will be in KHz,
 > but the clicks will lessen considerably).

 This improves the sound quality in ST 3.2 a fair amount. Previously, ST3
 didn't do any ultraclick removal. Ultraclicks are just little pops and
 cracks that result when you change samples or change the volume of
 samples. This only occurs in some instances, but when it does, it can get
 annoying. Ultraclick removal can be done by using a technique called
 "volume-ramping". Volume ramping means that the volume on the sample is
 turned way down when a crack is likely to occur so that you do not hear
 it. I never had trouble with ultraclicks in the previous version of ST3,
 but apparently a lot of people did, and this new feature fixes that. I'm
 not 100% sure that it uses volume-ramping, but whatever it does, it gets
 the job done. :)

 > The position counters and Channelscope now work with GUS, too.

 Well, the channelscope sure doesn't work on my GUS. The channelscope is
 still bracketed indicating it is "unavailable". However, if you use the
 "-x" command switch when loading up ST3, the channelscope will work.
 Before you try that, I'll warn you that when I used the channelscope,
 it worked on my system for about 10 seconds, then it froze up the whole
 thing. I'd suggest not using them, and this is probably why the
 documentation makes no mention of the "-x" parameter.

 > You can now save your custom color palettes.

 This version of ST3 lets you modify the default palette of colors. The
 previous version of ST3 also let you do this, but it would not save your
 colors, so you would have to go back and change them everytime you loaded
 it up. Because of this, I think that everyone pretty much got used to the
 default color scheme in ST3. Well, now we can finally save the color
 schemes that we create! There's a problem though, its fairly difficult
 to change colors. The color selection box is not very intuitive and its
 kind of like a slot-machine; you have got to be lucky to stumble upon the
 color code that you want. I don't expect many people will be coming up
 with very elaborate color schemes in ST3.

 Conclusion
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 ScreamTracker 3.2 is really a great upgrade. While its not perfect, I
 think that its a major improvement from the first release. Most of the
 major bugs have been fixed and the composing environment is 100% more
 stable then it used to be. There is no doubt that FastTracker 2 is quite a
 bit more advanced than ST3, but I think that the environment in ST3 is
 still a lot easier to use than FT2. Its all a matter of personal
 preference. Some of the people that I have interviewed are sticking with
 ST3 for this very reason. In addition, S3Ms are probably the most widely
 supported module format on the PC right now. I think this upgrade will
 continue to hold S3Ms as the primary module format and at the same time
 make composing them a lot easier on us ST3 users. :)

 Special thanks to Ali Ebnereza (HeatWave) for contributing a lot of
 insight to this article. He knows ST3 inside and out and he helped with a
 lot of the information here. He can be contacted at: aebnerez@osf1.gmu.edu

                       (Review of Autodesk Animator Pro)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Autodesk Animator Pro is a program that can be used to create animation.
 It has the ability to create animations with different pictures placed
 after each other and also animations doing funny things with one picture.

 The program itself is very large and it takes a long time to learn
 everything from the program.  There are a lot of different options. These
 options are very handy even if you don't create animations. For example, if
 you have made a picture with a black background and want to put in on a
 white background you can change this color from black into white or fill
 this background with white, you do this with the paint program you always
 use but then you'll see that the picture is much to bright.  Well with the
 option 'Dark' in AAP you can make the program look darker.

 It also has options to sharpen a picture or soften or make it look as if it
 has a relief in it.  There are just a lot of functions in it.  It takes a
 long period of testing them and experimenting with them.

 The program isn't that easy to use with all its functions, I have been
 using it for a long time and know a lot of functions that can be of use
 with changing a picture. The program isn't to be used as a paint program,
 it's more difficult to draw in AAP instead of a 'normal' paint program.

 The program does need EMS and does have some strange errors and error
 messages.  When you don't have enough EMS you get a message that something
 can't be found and sometimes it just crashes in the middle of the program
 and comes with the message from out of memory or memory failure. It can use
 VESA graphics cards so it will work on almost all configurations. It's
 recommended to have at least 8 meg and a fast machine to work with it
 because it takes a lot of memory and time. I'm running it on my 486DX2/66
 with 4 meg and a VLB graphics card and it is running quite well.

                                                                    ...Stony

I, Scoobs, am trying to compile a large group of electronic music (MOD, S3M,
MTM etc.) to place on an IBM-PC CD-ROM disk that we are trying to put out,  
to be called PS MuzakDisk.

The purpose of this CD is to promote this sort of electronic music and its 
authors to the general public who, at the present time, know nothing of 
music modules and the potential of them.
 
The format of the CD we are looking at is the main menu being a list of all
of the music types on the CD.  Then the user can select which section and
then be given a list.  They can then choose which music to listen to from 
that list.  The CD will be well presented with introduction artwork and the
like.  The intro, menu and player will be coded by Statix/KLF.
 
If you are interested in having your music on the CD-ROM or have any
questions about it, please contact me at the below address.

Thanks for listening!  :)

 Next week we should have several more good articles, including an interview
 with Purple Motion/FC and Maxwood/Majic 12.  Also be on the lookout for
 Dee-Cug's "How to Code Music Drivers."  This should be a 5-6 part series
 starting later this month.

 We are averaging 21 new subscribers to this newsletter a day!  At this
 rate, will will pass 1000 mid-next week.  I personally have no idea how
 many people there are in the scene, but it looks like we might find out. :)

 If you have anything you'd like to contribute to DemoNews, I'd be more
 than happy to include it.  It doesn't matter if its an advertisement or an
 article, we can use it.  Let me say it again: If you are a coder, musician,
 gfx artist, or organizer and have something to contribute, please send it
 my way.

 We could really use some Party 94' articles soon.  There has been very
 little action in this department.  Also, we could especially use some more
 artists articles.

 The quote for this week comes from "Progammers at Work" p.208.  In an
 interview Bob Carr said the following:

    I enjoy writing, and I think I'm literate.  I still toy with the idea
    of being a writer of fiction.  Writing English and software are far
    more than just acts of capturing something in code or on paper.  They
    are processes that help evolve your thinking tremendously.  When you're
    forced to write something down, you think the idea through two or three
    steps further.  - Bob Carr

 See you all next week!
