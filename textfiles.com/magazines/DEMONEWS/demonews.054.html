((Section 1...Standard Info))
==============================================================================
    DemoNews is a weekly publication dedicated to the demo scene.  It is
produced at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (aka WASP or HORNET).  
This newsletter focuses on all aspects of demos and demo-making  (including 
music, art, and coding).

There are currently three active demo-operators at this site:
     
     Dan Wright (Pallbearer) - dmw@eng.ufl.edu
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) - r3cgm@dax.cc.uakron.edu
     Mike - weis@elf.stuba.sk

    This site is mirrored by the following ftps:
         ftp.uwp.edu
         ftp.luth.se
         ftp.sun.ac.za
         ftp.uni-erlangen.de
         ftp.uni-paderborn.de

If you would like to receive a new copy of Demo News every Sunday in your
mailbox write to dmw@eng.ufl.edu.  We delete all bounced mail from this
service, so if you SHOULD BE getting Demo News and ARE NOT, please re-request
this newsletter.

==============================================================================
((Section 2...General))
==============================================================================

We could DEFINITLY use some to help with REVIEWING demos--namely all the
stuff in the "alpha/NEW" directory and anything new that arrives.  A one
line description (like what is in the DEMOS.? of every alpha directory) and
a few sentence description for our DEMOS.TXT file is all that is needed.

ITALIAN INTRO CONTEST (IIC):

For those who did not know there is a party somewhere in Italy next Weekend:
July 31st.  Grab the "IIC94INV" demo for more info if you are interested
in attending or live in Italy.

ASSEMBLY 94:

Two weeks till the big demoparty in Finland.  For more information download
the two assembly demos (both have ASM and 94 in them and can be found in
alpha/a or alpha/NEW directory).  There is also an "asm94" directory set
up under "compos"  [pub/msdos/demos/compos/asm94] where some information
about the party can be found.

If you are going to release a demo/intro at ASM94 then take some time and
give us some details here so we can put it in our next NEWSLETTER.

SPACE:

At one point we had 3.3 Megs of space left on this site......... 
Currently we are over 20 Megs again and we will delete some MUSIC and ANSI
this week.  So, if you are interested in ANSI either a) visit a MIRROR
site like ftp.uwp.edu or ftp.luth.se which will mostly still have the
OLDER stuff or b) download what you want ASAP.  We plan on sixthing about
15 megs of music and 20-40 megs of ANSI.

 GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Lots of activity this week.
      A few quick notes:  lots of new music by Nemesis, check it out.  To
download a file like happy!.zip, type "get happy\!.zip".  In general, if there
is a special character in the filename, you just preface it with a "\".
      There is a new musician out there that I want you to take note of:
Kerry Ho.  He's been uploading a lot of songs lately that have been of very
good quality.  He is definately someone to look out for.
      At stated in last week's demonews, the Music Contest 1 and Composers
Competition entries are being deleted.  I am keeping a full backup of these
directories JUST IN CASE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FIRSTIES (Main Feature)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ever wonder what the first MODs sounded like?  Well, wonder no more.
In my searching through the Amiga archives, I came across a couple of archives
which contained some of the very first MODs ever written.  These were made
back in 1987-1988 back when Karsten Obarski first invented the MOD format.
      You can get them under /incoming/music
      BTW, in future issues when I have files that accompany the article (like
this week), the files will be deleted on the next weekend to keep down on
storage restrictions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This probably does not interest many of you, so you can probably skip
this part.  Recently, a very good friend of mine (Jester, not of Sanity) left
to go to Southern France for a month and a half.  He has helped me immensely
with getting started in the graphics aspect of the demo scene, and even got
me set up with my very own copy of POV (Raytracing).
      Well, he and I wrote several times weekly, and I was a bit sad about
him leaving.  Well, guess what!?  Within a day or two of his departure, I got
a letter from Dee-Cug.  Dee-Cug is another of my close friends and we had
written regularly (I beta-tested UNIS669 for him), but he had lost his
internet account a couple of months ago.  Well, he's back, so I'm happy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CAMUG (Canton/Akron/Massilon Users Group)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Last week I gave a presentation at a local computer users group.  There
were about 30 people in attendence for the main demo feature and about 23 or
so for the music portion.
      I was very apprehensive about the whole deal (I don't like to speak in
front of large groups of people).  The average age of the audience was about
35, and it was mixed about evenly between males and females.  Overall, it
went very well, and I think I may have corrected a few ideas the people had
about computer music and the Sound Blaster card.  :)
      By the end of the demo portion of the presentation, I felt the audience
loosing interest.  I was trying to figure out what to do, and I was contem-
plating ending the presentation right there.  However, I started talking
about how I got Jester to do artwork for me.  I happened to mention that he
was 22 years old and started to get on the subject of the ages of people in
the demo scene.  The audience started to perk up!?!  So I talked about about
"eLiTe" and "lame" and how younger demo people are sometimes problamatic.
BINGO!  Human interest stories seemed to intrigue them much more than playing
a .s3m, so I went on and talked about a few select people, trying to crack a
joke every once in a while.
      The presentation ended (of course) with Second Reality.  I had to
talk about demo parties as well, and I told them of my failed attempt to
organize a bus trip from the USA to Finland for Assembly 94.  ;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ASSEMBLY 94'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Next week is a special Assembly 94 issue!  Get it.

((Section 5...Demo CD))
==============================================================================

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
(i.e. More information, cost, how to get the DEMO/MC][ CD)

I have uploaded a NEW want list to the directory and would be greatful
if people would upload those demos and others not on the "fileslist.txt"
to the "democd" directory.  If you have a BBS with a lot of demos please
upload your LIST and I will CALL or let you know what I would like.

ART:

We are looking for artist to design the ART for the CD's inserts.  Pay
will be 10-100 copies of your ART (worth $5-$50).  It all depends on the
cost/min press run.  If we have to run 1000 you get a ton of your art in
FULL color or whatever we decide to use.  (Most likely Full color for
the front and back of the book and possibly for the insert).

DAT:

We are going to need to borrow or find someone with access to DAT player
to help us master our music for the CD.

RESERVE:

We plan on pressing between 200 and 300 of these DEMO/MUSIC CD's.  Thus
far approximately 61 CD's have been reserved (w/o exchange of money).  If
you are interested in reserving a copy E-mail me at: dmw@eng.ufl.edu

DEMOS WANTED:

Just in case you do not check out the WANTLIST.TXT here it is:

This is a want list of demos I am looking for to put on the DEMO/MUSIC CD.  
If you have any of these or OTHER demos not on this site (ftp.eng.ufl.edu) 
please upload them to the pub/msdos/demos/incoming [/democd] directory.

Thanks--dmw@eng.ufl.edu

This week we have TWO:

     For the industrialites in the audience.  My band "id", no not the
software company, (trust me I've gotten plenty of shit for keeping the
name), has just released it's first demo.  It's more rockish than I 
hoped, but it's still good industrial for a first release.  
Anyways, all the tracks were laid down with cakewalk for win.  

If you would like to hear a slice of industrial rock
just send a check/money order for $4.00 US Dollors
($5.00 overseas) to:
     =======>>>> make check payable to Trent Hare

PO Box 846
Flagstaff, AZ 86002-846

Note: we are not making any profit off this, it just covers
tape duplication and shipping  >:]

You may also be interested in that we used a GUS and a Proaudio
for some of the sounds.  Sometimes the old FM sounds come in handy.
I have just thrown out my Proaudio and for some god awful reason
purchased a SB awe32.  (It actually seems pretty powerful for
uploading your own samples.  You can put 32 megs on the soundcard 
--> if your rich.  Poor musicians take what they can get.  
And if you like I could throw a few *.wrk (I guess I could put them
out as midi files also)  files onto the net.  (imbedded samples 
and all.  Even some of the samples and sounds were ripped 
>from the internet.)   But for full effect you have to 
hear the vocals and guitar.  I also hope to throw out a few
mtm's or ult's pretty soon.  Live long and eat.

Well, the info.log (aka ftp.syslog) is now 40+ megs on this site and dates 
back to early July.  If I attemped to create a TOP25DL I would definitly DUMP
"core."  So, I'll just wait till the log gets reset before I do another
