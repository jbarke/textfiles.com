(SOME PEOPLE CAN HELP OUT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of people who have offered to help out with HORNET once Dan
leaves:

             Andrew Younger         - aiy@mundil.cs.mu.OZ.AU
             Brenton Swart (Zenith) - bswa1595@pilot.stu.cowan.edu.au
             Ryan Cramer            - rcramer1@mason1.gmu.edu
             Styros (John Way)      - iq23@jove.acs.unt.edu

I will write these people soon regarding their respective duties.

LINKS

Many of the "links" under the /groups directories were updated this
weekend--i.e. many music links deleted.  So, if you have a dir under
the /groups structure and some demos are not linked please let us know
and we will try to fix/update your link.

FALL BACK

Welp, this is the last weekend in October and everyone knows what that
means...right?  Yep, it is time to set our clocks back.  I wonder if they
do this in other parts of the world or only here in the US of A?  It is 
called Daylight Savings time...it begins in the SPRING and ends in the FALL
right before Halloween.  Now it will be LIGHTER in the morning and DARKER
in the Evening...basically less LIGHT during what many would call the "DAY."
I always like to kid that I am going to "save" my hour for a later date--
instead of just sleeping it away....like for an EXAM...but, since I no longer
attend school/college I'll just sleep it away.

(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of songs uploaded this week.  Check 'em out.

As always, our room online here is very small.  Remember, most songs have a
life expectency of about 1 month or so.

There was a module ripper released this week.  It said "extracts modules from
any demo".  If there is but one demo you can't rip a song from with this
program, then the author has misrepresented the program.  For each upload on
this site, I put a one-line description in the file section of this
newsletter.  If I put down "this program rips songs from ALL demos" and it
turns out not to be true, then I am in effect lying.  Just be careful how you
promote things.

[Back to Snowman again]

This past week, I gave a presentation on demos/music in the scene for Akron
University's ACM Computer Science Club.  About 20 people showed up, and it
seemed to go well.  There were troubles with the projector so I couldn't play
Crystal Dreams ][ or the Music Contest ][ Final demo.  However, EMF-Verses
brought quite a few chuckles in the Bill Gates section.  I also did my best
to tarnish the image people have of Creative Labs cards.

For those die-hard Demonews readers out there, you will remember that I gave
a similar presentation this past summer for the Canton-Akron-Massilon Users
Group (CAMUG).

(NEW MOD SITE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a large new MOD reporitory available at:

ftp   : jawbox.pc.cc.cmu.edu
under : /pub/mods

It contains over 1800 MODs, as well as a sprinkling of 669s, S3Ms and other
formats, as well as a variety of players and editors.

==============================================================================
((Section 5...Code Articles by Snowman))
==============================================================================
(GENERAL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple weeks ago, I wrote about 2 books that are very good for coding in
the demo scene: Richard Ferraro's EGA/VGA/SVGA Guide, and Trick of the Game
Programming Gurus.  I have seen them both in many book stores and I want them
very much.  However, both are $45 and I can not currently afford it.  Looks
like I'll have to wait until X-Mas.

(EMOTICON 94')
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You people are crazy!  :)  I announced a goofy little contest last week and
8 people actually submitted entries.

In summary, the goal of EMOTICON 94 was to find a solution to the following:

Problem:  Having a :) at the end of parenthesis really looks confusing.
Example:  This is an odd contest (like I don't know that already :))

Here are the replies:

[FireLight] - Snowman's Personal Favorite

hey, i think there are a few ways to fix your :) smiley face in a
pair of brackets..

one - put a space after it (hello :) )
or 2.. just banner it ie.

          #      ##
         ###       #
          #         #
(hello              # )
          #         #
         ###       #
          #      ##

[JHF]

Just add a few spaces after the ) to set it off from the smiley. e.g.
Hey I think this is cool! (if you like this that is :)  )

[Eric (Handleless)]

That's simple, there are two solutions:

1. use :> instead of :) 
      example:  (sample message :>)  <----that still looks funny.
2. use the :) as part of the parenthesis.
      example:  (sample message :)  

or if you must use parenthesis, space one or more times before closing:
(sample message :) )

[Lord Debugger]

Here are my proposals:

1. use rather smiley for left-handed people: (blah, blah, blah (: )
2. use standard smiley but put space between the last char of the smiley and
the closing parenthesis: (blah, blah, boo :)) )

[Catrin, F.  Chile]

We can turn the face to the other side (like this (-: ). Also the mouth can
be changed for a (I don't know how to say 'bigote' :-}). Or like in math, for
avoiding confusion with parenths, use rectangular parenths on the outer side
<Damn old IBM terminal, but you can imagine this or no?  :) >.  A childish
smily face can be used too :-p ).  Or combine two alternatives together
<like this (: >

[Bruno Schneider]

I close the parenthesis before the smily (just as simple as walking
forward) :)

[Nastirth / RadioActive Brains]

My solution to your problem is just to use closed parentethis instead of the 
open ones [just like this :-)].

[Daniel Potter]

Here's my solution: (This is some text :)
That's what i've always done :))


[Back to Snowman]

All that I have to say is I must have way too much free time on my hands to
announce a contest like this.  (I won't comment about what it means if you
          #      ##
         ###       #
          #         #
entered             # )
          #         #
         ###       #
          #      ##

                              `----------------'

This weeks stupid contest centers around text descriptions (you know, those
things your supposed to upload with your file).

Has anyone ever seen a description larger than the file it was refering to?
Look for them on any FTP, BBS, etc. and send your discovery to me.  Next week
I will post them.

Imagine the prestige of winning Stupid Contest 2!  Your girlfriend, your
parents, and even your pets will look up to you with awe at your remarkable
talent.  :)

Prizes include a Gravis Ultrasound and a lot of BBS subscriptions....oh wait!
Those were the prizes to Composer's Competition.  I guess you'll just have
to be happy with recognition in DemoNews.

Check /pub/msdos/demos/incoming/democd for UPDATES and information.
And YES, I do occasionally update this directory.

All the stuff should be at 3M by now...figure 2 weeks for printing and
1 week for the first batch of CD's.  Yep...my time estimates were 1 month
off when I said mid October.

[From Snowman]

Boo!  I didn't have anything else scary to add this week, so I guess this will
have to suffice.

[Dan]

HAPPY HALLOWEEN

SCARY MOVIES are always fun to watch.  The spookier the better...like 
HALLOWEEN III--which had nothing to do with the previous two and Michael
Myers--where an Evil person creates MASKS that end up killing people when
they watch his TV commercial on Halloween.  I've always wondered what would
happen in a fight between Freddy Kruger and Jason V. (Friday the 13th fame).
Some of my more favorite "Horror" movies include EVIL DEAD ][, Jacobs Ladder,
Body Parts, Hellraiser, Creepshow, Maxmimum Overdrive (and most S. King 
movies), The people under the stairs, the Friday the 13th series and the
like.  Most that make the movie theatres are decent and those that don't...
well, sometimes those are even better.

Perhaps the scariest thing is that our society seems to be getting more
violent and perhaps some day these so called HORROR movies won't be such
far fetched "fantasies" after all.  Think about it...does TV influence
people?  TV is VERY big here in the states...Europeans probably have a 
hard time understanding that.  CABLE bypasses 97% of homes here in the US
with 60+% subscribed to some cable service.  We don't get a mere 4 channels
here...we get 40+ and there is almost always something on.  More power
to YOU if you can LIVE without a TV...it is a powerful drug...a plug in drug.

Here in the US--probably unlike most countries--we actually CELEBRATE
OCTOBER 31st.  Kids dress up in costumes and go from door to door saying
"Trick or Treat" and get candy...amazing huh.  I believe I stopped 
trick or treating in my early teens but man...the candy you could get!!!
Usually after that two to three hour of going from door to door you
could collect enough candy (10+ lbs) to last MONTHS.  The best part is it
is free and you get a WIDE variety of candy you would never normally buy.
Carving Pumpkins, wearing black, and dressing up are all apart of the 
custom.  It is a great holiday though no one gets off work as if it were
a holiday--funny huh.  So put on your costume, get your self some DRY ICE and
bring out your candy cause the kids are coming tomorrow.

Enough talk for this issue. Remember to pray for those DEAD souls like our 
pal John Candy who was born Oct 31, 1950 and would have been 44 years old
tomorrow.

My cat Boo says BOO!

Orange & Black,
