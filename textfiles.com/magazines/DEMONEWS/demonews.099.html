=---------------------------------------------------[Introduction]--[Snowman]-=

 Greetings and salutations.  We are back with another issue of DemoNews.
 I am feeling quite somber today, and it appears that this issue reflects
 it.  

 A rather startling discovery was made this week by our friend Trixter.  If
 you look at the header for this newsletter, you will see the current size
 of our archive listed.  The number listed is misleading.  We _do_ have
 approximately 1 gig of files, but those files actually occupy 2 gigs.
 Why the discrepancy?

 ftp.cdrom.com stores files in blocks, much like your traditional DOS-box.
 That means that the minimal amount of space a file can occupy is 32k (or
 some other gross size like that).  See if you jump to the same conclusion
 I did.  Why are we at 2 gigs?  

 Well, you know all those little .txt files we have on our site (one for 
 every .zip, .arj, and .lha)?  Each of those files may look like 50 or 100 
 bytes, but in actuality each eats up 32k of storage.  In total, we estimate 
 that .txt descriptions occupy half a gig!

 We will be accelerating our conversion from .txt to the 00index format. :)
 
 The big news this week is Assembly '95.  And so, logically?, we have 
 absolutely no articles (save the results) concerning this landmark party. 
 Blame it on what you like, but I couldn't seem to obtain any juicy tidbits.  
 We'll scrape together a couple tardy articles for next issue.

 In fact, we really don't have that much in the way of articles this week.
 I am working on getting past the "Grr... I'm the article monster!  Feed me!"
 stage and working toward the "Its ok if we don't have that many articles"
 stage.  You the reader may suffer, but at least it gives me solace.

 That said, enjoy the file listings, enjoy the editorial, and enjoy the party
 results.  

 To all faithful DemoNews subscribers, it is now time to hold hands.  
 The number 1500 is within grasp.  Be sure to subscribe all your relatives
 and pets during this next week.

=---------------------------[Reply to "Tracking Society" Editorial]--[Necros]-=

 [Note: "Tracking Society" editorial appeared in DemoNews #98]

 Your description of the various social stratification that occurs on IRC is
 quite accurate.  There used to be a time when only a very few people had
 trackers, and in fact the ones that did have them usually were chosen
 fairly randomly, and included a whole bunch of coders, artists, and other
 non-music types.

 Back then, there was the 'elite', and then the 'rest of the people'.
 However, due to the recent explosion of the size of the music scene over
 the last few years, especially in the U.S., a bit of social darwinism has
 taken place.

 It is hard to make a mark in the scene these days with so many people
 producing such high-quality stuff. The one thing people have to start
 realizing, though, is that you cannot expect to go to ftp.cdrom.com, pick
 up a tracker, write your first song ever, and then expect to go onto #trax
 and XDCC it down everyone's throats.

 Once you have a bad rep, it's really really hard to get rid of it. I
 tracked for a solid 6 months before I started releasing publicly, and I
 also had about 10 years of music experience before I even touched a
 tracker.  It is the exact same way with art, code, and anything else. Why
 upload every crappy thing you've done to Hornet and flood the /incoming
 dirs?

 Is the stuff you first create what you are truly capable of? It just seems
 that lately the signal to noise ratio on ftp.cdrom.com is so low, I barely
 download from there anymore unless a file is recommended to me by a friend.
 I realize that people are perfectly entitled to upload whatever they darn
 please to sites, but they should stop and think for a moment: A) how does
 this compare to other stuff that's out there? and B) does this really
 represent the kind of work I am capable of?

 Well I'm rambling again but your editorial somehow inspired it, so it's all
 your fault :> (muhaha)

=----------------------------["Growing Up in the Scene" Editorial]--[Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 All of you reading this editorial are my parents, my siblings, or my
 children.  For those who attended the NAID demo party, you may recall in my
 closing speech how I mentioned that the demo scene is a "family".  Today I
 am reminded just how true this is.

 _____Five Stages of Growth

 There seem to be five very distinct stages we all go through in the scene.

 We are born.  We download our first demo, our first s3m, our first intro,
 and are... enlightened.  We discover this underground world called the
 "demo scene".  We are in awe, not fully understanding, but realizing that
 this place is one of the stops on our journey of life.  We are born.

 We are children.  We absorb, as a child does.  Memorizing names, demo
 vocabulary words, slang, we begin to assimilate ourselves into this
 culture. We form some sort of feeling about our where we are headed. Some 
 choose to be musicians, others coders, others graphicians (still don't know 
 how you pronounce that), and yet others (like myself) take to the realm of 
 organization.  We are children.

 We are adults.  We have a good feel for where we belong in the scene and
 how well we are respected.  Even though our talents are not yet fully
 honed, we have a fairly good idea of how much we are likely to achieve in
 our demo scene lifetime.  By now, we have formed many strong friendships
 that will sustain us for years.  We are adults.

 We are elders.  Not too much surprises us anymore.  More often than not, we
 take a cynical view of the scene.  Most new productions are pure crap and
 childish.  We content ourselves by associating with those we "grew up"
 with, and laughing at the newbies and their mistakes.  We also tend to say
 a lot of things like "Remember when...?".  We are elders.

 We are dead.  Not in the physical sense of course, but we are no longer
 active in the scene, having tracked and coded, down and uploaded, e-mailed
 and IRCed, till our minds became static numb.  We check in on the the scene
 every now and again just to make sure everything is still going well, like
 some watchful deity eye protecting the naturally chaotic populace.  We are
 dead.

 _____Personal Experience (skip this if you like)

 I can recall my birth back in mid-1992.  Putre Faction, Amnesia, Vicky,
 ModPlay, CMF, ROL, and MOD files were all part of my personal
 "enlightenment process".  I remember fondly (and perhaps pervertedly) the
 scorn on my father's face when he would confront me with a large phone
 bill.  I would fork over hard-earned stockboy money to pay for my long
 distance calls to demo BBS's.

 Cronologia, Whacker Tracker, The Sound Barrier, Composer 669.  That's the
 stuff my childhood is made of.  I remember once having a disagreement with
 C.C.Catch back in 1992 about which sounded better: Sound blaster filter on
 or off.  I was young and cocky, wanting to take on the world, wanting to
 become the greatest musician there ever was and go down in Imphobia
 history.  Years later, I have a much more realistic view of the scene.

 My adulthood is proving to be an interesting time.  Since I get to review
 all /incoming/demos, my view of the demo scene is a fairly accurate one I
 think.  Most of the uploads I rate are devoid of creativity and flare:
 stuck in the rut of phong shaded donuts and 3D Studio objects. Occasionally
 a glimmer of hope trickles in: an X14, a DOPE, a Slow. This is what keeps 
 me going.

 I have discovered that there is a very real similarity between lifeblood
 family and demo scene family that transcends mortal time.  Not only do we
 ourselves go through different stages of growth in the scene, but we also
 take on different roles: children, siblings, and parents.

 My parents in the scene were Dan Wright and Dan Potter.  I credit Dan
 Potter (coder for Digital Infinity) for opening my eyes to a global image
 of the scene.  I credit Dan Wright for having faith enough in me to pass on
 the responsibilities of maintaining our demo archive.  These two individuals
 have been my parents and have shaped my perceptions.

 My brothers.  Oh, my brothers.  I have many dear friends, but very few
 brothers.  Ryan Cramer, my college student mirror, with remarkable
 connections.  Jester, my long lost POV friend; diligent and talented.
 Krystall, that goofy French kid who started on .ULT while I was on .669 and
 was with me through the .FAR era.  Trixter, my Pascal=lamer friend, with an
 unnerving ability to grasp concepts and who is my twin in humor.

 GraveDigger, the gifted and dedicated journalist and musical organizer
 extraordinare.  Jeff, the melodramatic and vibrant Quebecker who would be
 in tears if I didn't mention him.  :)  Stony, the innocent and angelically
 positive buddy from The Netherlands.  And Jason Nunn, my upside-down bloke
 from the land of British Prisoners and deadly wildlife.  Two coders, two
 musicians, two graphicians, and an organizer.  These are my brothers.

 _____The Point

 "Snowman, this article seems to have little to do with the demo scene.
 Further, you are rambling and using only sentence fragments.  I fear
 you shall be mailed in a negative manner when this editorial is published."

 "Fear not consciousness.  I shall give the readers some food for thought
 and justify my rambling before I depart."

 In my self-delusional capacity to do so, I proclaim this week "Reflection
 Week".  Take a moment to think about all those individuals who have
 influenced you along the way, to those who you have grown up with, and to
 those who you are influencing at this very moment.

 Light travels at 186,282 miles per second (if memory serves).  Fast as this
 is, it still takes a fraction of a second for images to reach your eyes. In
 a very real sense then, we never see the future, or even the present:
 we are always looking at the past.  This seems quite fitting, as it is the
 past experiences in our lives that mold who we are today.

 Every once in a while, pull out and dust off your own demo memory book and
 peer into your past.  You might be surprised at what you find.

 This editorial was inspired by my cat Herbie, who died this morning after
 loosing a tough battle with cancer.  May his gentle soul rest in peace.

=---------------[Music Contest 3 / Freedom CD Update]--[Dan Wright + Snowman]-=

 _____Introduction

 Its the contest that just won't quit: Music Contest 3.  Weeks after the
 official results were posted in DemoNews, Snowman continues to work on the
 mc3final.exe, while Dan Wright and GD work on assembling the lists of songs
 which will be put on the Freedom CD.

 Due to some severe difficulties in communicating with Floss, things are
 moving along at a snail's pace.  We still are without a list of author's
 e-mail addresses.  Because of this, we have been unable to contact several
 of the proposed song's authors (to be included on the Freedom CD).

 Delays in the mc3final.exe can be explained (though not justified) by the
 following reasons: producing DemoNews, reviewing tons of new demos, intros,
 and graphics, restructuring the /alpha directory, visiting out of town
 relatives.

 _____Announcement

 To all MC3 entrants, please reupload your song with full text and
 appropriate song title to ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/demos/incoming/freedom.  It
 was a gross oversight on our part that we did not plan ahead for this.

 Our sincere apologies for all of these inconveniences.

 _____Proposed Song List for the Freedom CD

 This is the song list--a final as far as I am concerned-- regarding the
 songs that will be on the CD.  I am going to have XTEN work with this and
 get me something final by Wednesday.

 Below are the songs that will appear on the Freedom CD in the order they
 will appear.  All of the information below is assumed correct until
 otherwise notified.  This file may be distributed--especially if it will
 get me feedback from the 5 musicians whose song names I had to make up.

 All tracks with * contain songs I named--A total of 5 songs.  If I do
 not get a response from these people by Tuesday 22th of August then
 the name I picked will be final.

 Stuff inside () do not need to be on the Art--tray card. Tray card needs:
 # of track, Author, and Song Name (Like Escape but Times are not necessary
 unless there is room and then the times below are only approximations)

 ? Means I do not know the correct answer.

 *** Some songs may need to be FADED OUT (i.e Song #13)***

=------------------------------------------[General Ramblings]--[Ryan Cramer]-=

 1. Force 10 Music Pack #6 - I was asked to do a review of this music disk
    for this week. Unfortunately, I did not have the time, but I wanted to
    point out that this was a very nice production and is worth checking
    out. The music is pretty good, especially the songs by Zapper. The
    interface is also very nice. While not a Progression or an Epidemic,
    Force 10 has done a nice job with this production.

 2. I got a message from Clement Poon (sorry if that's the wrong spelling)
    this week, and he wanted me to review a new music disk that he and some
    friends have done. It includes such musicians as: Markell Moss, Lloyd
    Yoon, Donovan Seidle, Steve Leung, and Clement Poon. Apparently a bunch
    of Canadians "eh?". Well, being a hoser, I was not able to find their
    music disk which is titled calgary.zip or cmd or something like that. If
    anybody finds this, let me know because I'd like to take a look. It
    sounds like a good music disk that apparently has some NON-TECHNO music
    in it. Imagine that! That would be a first, and that's something I'd
    definitely like to hear.

 3. Some loser created a pack of songs by KX-Mode/Epi and put in the
    FILE_ID.DIZ - "Ryan Cramer's best hits!". Well, I haven't heard the
    songs, but I can tell you that they are not mine. Thanks to Mystical of
    Purple who spotted this music pack on some Dutch board or Danish or one
    of those countries around there.

 4. I'm still listening to Progression!
