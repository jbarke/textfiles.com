 releases a weekly newsletter called DemoNews, and is starting to offer other
 services.  HORNET specializes in the "demo scene", and files that are re-
 lated to demos, coding, music, or graphics are welcome.

(Goodbye Michelle)                                         Christopher G. Mann
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For the past 4.5 months, I dated Michelle Davis.  Very early in our
 relationship, I introduced her to demos.  She seemed very impressed with
 the work that went on in making such a production.  Over time, we made
 a regular habit of getting together and watching the latest releases.

 Michelle was a good listener and would let me ramble on about Music Contest
 ][, the Escape CD, Assembly 94, etc.  It got to the point where I could say
 'I hear that FC is coming out with a new demo soon', and she would reply
 'well, its about time...the last major release was Second Reality at ASM93'.
 She KNEW the scene (from my perspective).

 I started dating Michelle back when Music Contest ][ was a baby.  We would
 listen to new entries as they came in.  V-vibes was a song she was
 particularly fond of.  Given the limited space on the Escape CD, her
 pursuasion was actually a factor in getting that song included.  It was kind
 of funny when the contest was finishing up: we would look at some of the
 ratings the judges were giving songs and shake our heads in disbelief. :)

 She was there when the MC2DEMO, Escape intro, Escape CD, and several other
 projects were finished.  In fact, she is the only person that can really
 appreciate the work that went into MC][.  In many ways, she has an edge over
 many people in the scene already because she has seen several projects
 go from idea to planning, to production, and to release.  Even though she
 can not code, write music, or do graphics, I think she might have done a
 pretty good job organizing people to put together a demo.

 Recently, Michelle and I parted on good terms.  She is a user of Prodigy and
 recently gained the ability to send e-mail on internet.  Here is part of a
 letter I receieved a few days after our breakup:

          Me again...  Thank you for your prompt reply.  I've been
         doing a lot of thinking today and I don't want to completely
         lose you.  I understand that we are no longer dating but, if
         we could, I'd like to stay in touch through demos...
          I've come to really love the demo scene and since I have a
         sucky<G> computer, I would probably never watch another demo
         again.  That thought doesn't sit well with me.  If it would
         be alright with you, I'd like to get together every now and
         again to watch whatever new demos are out there.
          Also, I'd like it very much if you'd keep me updated on all
         demo happenings, if possible I'd like to hear about all the
         important stuff before DemoNews comes out.
          Maybe we can base a friendship on this subject.  It is just
         an idea after all.

 The Demo Scene had a big impact on our relationship.  It served both as
 something to do (watching demos), and something to talk about (my projects).
 I count myself very lucky to have found a girlfriend who took an active
 interest in the demo scene.  Those of you out there whose girlfriends
 couldn't identify an IBM from a toaster can agree.  :)

 If you look back at what I've done in the past 4 months, there is a little
 bit of Michelle in everything.  Her constant support and encouragement
 have allowed me to function better under stress.

 Michelle, even though the demo scene might not have known who you were, your
 influence was felt around the world.  You will be missed.

(Goodbye Music)                                            Christopher G. Mann
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 With this issue, I formally say goodbye to the music aspect of the scene.
 I have three releases this week:

 byemusic.zip - My first (and final) music disk.
 mictro  .zip - A birthday demo I did for Michelle (see above)
 tut1    .zip - Converted source code to Denthor's demo tutorial.

(Secret Part in New Intro/Majic 12)                                       Mike
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NewIntro - New Intro / Majic 12
    - again Maxwood's secret part :)) This time it was really easy to find
      how to enter it using debuger - press up-arrow to start tron-like
      game, and use all arrows to control it.
    - as usualy, this intro is "GUS at 220 only" but it also works with
      no-GUS. But it is terrible to get no-sound if there is a GUS in machine
      on other port (users with GUS & SB know it very well). But again
      you'll need to patch a lot of values in uncompressed code to switch
      it to 240 or other base-port....


==============================================================================
((Section 3...DemoNews Advancements))
==============================================================================
 We are still working on the WWW/HTML interface for DemoNews.  White Noise is
 in charge of pushing DemoNews to new heights.  We are also considering
 posting DemoNews to a few demo newsgroups on USENET.

 Ryan Cramer has just told me that Data Connection (his BBS in Virginia, USA)
 will be getting an internet mail connection around X-Mas time.  This should
 increase the number of subscribers to DemoNews by about 100.

==============================================================================
((Section 4...New Uploads))
==============================================================================
Note: All ANSI was taken offline this week.  We do not have resources to keep
this area active on HORNET.  In addition, there was more profanity and
creation of difficult-to-remove directories in this section than in any other.
For example here are some of the files that WERE in the /incoming/ansi
directory this very week:

drwxrwxr-x  3 10            512 Nov 23 00:43 ????
drwxrwxr-x 11 10           1024 Nov 25 00:55 ..????????

                                             assholes

I am NOT pleased.  The last directory above answers its own question.

(General)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week we have some great music scene coverage. We start out with an
 extensive interview of Skaven of Future Crew. The interview discusses many
 things including Skaven's background, his influences, and his future as a
 musician. The interview also goes into Future Crew productions, the future
 of Scream Tracker III, Skaven's other interest: Graphics, and his plans
 for a new tracker. I think that this is the most extensive interview done
 on Skaven to date. Hope that you enjoy it.

 Next, we also have a very complete review of Extreme's new tracker, called
 "Extreme Tracker". We go through many of its features, its advantages and
 disadvantages. The article also compares it to Scream Tracker III and Fast
 Tracker 2, its two main competitors.

 Skaven of Future Crew is perhaps the most famous musician in the PC demo
 scene, along with Purple Motion. Both musicians have maintained the top
 two spots in the charts ever since Future Crew's megademo "Unreal" was
 released in 1992. Their demo "Second Reality" is still undisputed to be
 the best demo ever produced. Skaven's music gave the demo a movie-like
 feel and I think that many people would agree that it was the best music
 that we've ever heard in a demo. Skaven truly is one of the founders of
 the PC demo music scene. I think that many musicians in the scene today
 were very influenced by his music and may not have been involved in the
 scene had it not been for his inspirational music. Skaven has also done
 music for many other projects, including his kick-ass music disk entitled
 "Chaotic Mind", his TP'92 intro music, his ASM'94 intro music, several
 individual S3M releases, his Epidemic music, and many others... I'm very
 pleased that we were able to get an interview from Skaven this week. This
 interview was conducted on Saturday, November 26th, 1994.

 [Start of interview: Skaven/Future Crew]

 RC: Ryan Cramer - rcramer1@osf1.gmu.edu - Fairfax, Virginia, USA.
 SK: Skaven      - skaven@janus.otol.fi  - Finland.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RC: What originally got you interested in tracked music?

 SK: I got interested in tracker music when I saw Scream Tracker and
     started playing with it. I actually registered my copy from PSI.

 RC: What type of musical background do you have?

 SK: I have no musical background at all - even at school I chose art. It
     started when I began using Scream Tracker. PSI then asked me to
     beta test Scream Tracker III, and thats how my career with Future Crew
     started.

 RC: Was your first musical work with Future Crew, or were you doing stuff
     before that?

 SK: I did several pieces with my copy of Scream Tracker and played them to
     PSI and friends, before joining - my first Future Crew pieces were the
     musics composed for our demo "Unreal".

 RC: So the stuff in "Unreal" was some of your first music. Thats amazing
     considering how excellent the music was. To this day, I'm still amazed
     by your song "Realm of Chaos" from the credits of Unreal.

 SK: Glad to hear that. :)

 RC: What music would you say your most influenced by, either from CDs or
     other tracked music?

 SK: Most probably.. should I say.. Jean-Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream.
     Nowadays I'm into newage and ambient, such as Philip Glass.

 RC: Jarre's music has changed a lot thorugh the years, do you like his
     older style (aka "Oxygene") or his newer stuff (like Chronologie)?

 SK: Actually, both. He's gotten stinking rich, so he can afford any synth
     he wants... maybe his newer music is a bit too full.

     His older music used to be one-man music, but nowadays he has a band.
     So his style has been influenced and mixed a lot.

 RC: How about Tangerine Dream, they've TOTALLY changed, they used to be
     using all analog synth stuff, now they just use their presets on their
     Korgs. :) Do you like Tangerine Dream's earlier stuff, or their newer
     stuff? (I personally like both)

 SK: Oh, I didn't like the old "nonfigurative" stuff at all. I DID like
     when they experimented with Klaus Schulze. When it comes to their
     newest music, it has become very "commercial" and populistic. I like
     their music between these two phases.

 RC: What are your plans for the Future (musically)?

 SK: Musically? Hard to say - Purple Motion is a true musical professional
     anyway. If I can afford a synth someday, sure I'll keep on doing it.
     But I might as well move to graphics.

     The future is open, really. I am 70% sure, though, that music will NOT
     be my primary way of making a living ...but rather, a way to earn a
     few extra bucks. :)

 RC: Speaking of your graphics, they are really incredible. Will you be
     doing graphics for any future FC productions or anything like that?

 SK: Certainly. I only lacked the EXPERIENCE, because I was never asked to
     draw too much. Not until now have I drawn enough to call myself a
     GFX-man, so expect me to publish an array of graphics soon. For your
     curiousity, the upcoming "Chromatics III" music disk.

     When it comes to drawing, I've been doing it since I was a kid - on
     paper. I chose art at school even, not music.

 RC: Well, I, as I'm sure many others, will be looking forward to seeing
     your graphics work. I really enjoyed your graphics works that you've
     done in the past.

 SK: Thanks. :)

 RC: What would you consider to be your best piece of music that you've
     written?

 SK: It depends a lot on the mood. But "Mercury Rain" and "Deep in her
     Eyes" please me the most - in the means of being well structured. I
     never was too good at structuring pieces. Those songs, in my humble
     opinion, were full of ideas with no unnecessary over-emphasizing. I
     kinda like "Omniphilia" too.

 RC: Well, I for one have really enjoyed all of your music. I think the
     ones I enjoyed the most were your Second Reality tune, "Deep in Her
     Eyes" and your winning ASM'93 song titled "Ice Frontier".

 SK: ...and I'm glad to hear you like them. Oh, I am personally a bit
     disappointed with my Second Reality music. It was TOO powerful -
     almost noisy. It could have been better.

 RC: What plans does Future Crew have for the future? Are you guys planning
     on any future releases (if this is confidential, you do not have to
     answer this question)?

 SK: Well, something confidential, of course... but I would like to see FC
     start a real business. We DO have all the talent and potential to reach
     new heights - but it looks like we've gotten into some difficulties
     lately. Such as, our coders being too tied up.

     <pause>
     So, we'll see...

     <pause>
     Something big is boiling under the quiet surface, though... :)
     ...but I won't tell more.

 RC: Something big? Sounds good, can't wait. :)

     What do you think of the many PC scene musicians that are trying to
     copy your music. They're ripping your samples and everything. I know I
     did that too when I first started composing. :) Are you disappointed
     or complimented by this?

 SK: I don't mind people ripping my SAMPLES. As I said, I am too poor to
     afford a synthesizer. What else could I do than rip? Of course, I've
     always used Advanced Digiplayer very creatively, and "hidden" the fact
     that I rip - not to mention I have a big library, so all my songs
     contain samples from several differnet songs - and are a real mix.

     I feel... well... complimented, I guess. If I really should. :)
     What I WOULD feel bad about, is people ripping my chords and melodies.

 RC: What do you think of these new trackers coming out, such as Extreme's
     Tracker and Fast Tracker 2?

 SK: I haven't even tried any other trackers other than ST and ST3 yet -
     except for UltraTracker, which scared me away. Perhaps I should be a
     bit more explorative.

 RC: Do you know if Future Crew will be making any new versions of Scream
     Tracker III?

 SK: PSI said that he will try to fix most of the bugs in ST3, "if he gets
     the time", which has nowadays become very limited. :(

 RC: Ah but atleast theres hope. :) Maybe someday someone will code a
     new ST3 just like the old one, but better.

 SK: Actually, I have already, with my friend, designed a new generation
     music tracker program - "Quantum Composer". But its ONLY a plan, so
     far.

 RC: This "Quantum Composer" sounds interesting, is there anything else
     you'd like to say about it now?

 SK: How about.. object oriented? Its the magic word. A new type of
     structure for patterns.

     Thats only one idea, I'm not going to leak the rest. :)

 RC: Are there any people you'd like to greet or additional things you'd
     like to say?

 SK: What I'd like to say... don't trust in rumours. I have gotten quite
     silly on IRC at times, and it seems that some people take that
     seriously, and spread those things as rumours. Not good.

     ...and I'd like to greet Necros, atleast. He has what it needs. His
     songs have rhythm, tension, perfected structure...

 RC: Thanks for taking the time to do this interview, its greatly
     appreciated!

 SK: Okay... was glad to give it. :)

 This week, Extreme finally released a usable version of their new
 tracker. Naturally, its called: Extreme Tracker. I'm sure that many of
 you have already seen this tracker, but in the past it was unusable
 because it would not let you save. Well, it seems that Extreme decided
 to follow Triton's lead and make their tracker (atleast the beta
 version) freeware. Extreme has really made a nice piece of software
 here, and I'm going to go through a detailed review of this tracker while
 comparing it to Scream Tracker 3 and Fast Tracker 2.

 General Overview
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Extreme has really focused on the interface in their tracker. In many
 respects, its very similar to Fast Tracker 2. Extreme tracker uses a mouse
 driven interface, but all commands are also accessable through hot key
 command strokes which are listed in the included documentation file.
 Extreme tracker offers some very powerful features, here is a list of
 features from their information file.

   * 32 GUS Channels
   * 255 Samples
   * 65536 Patterns
   * 65536 Positions
   * 7 Commands on each note
   * 8 Octaves
   * Separate panpot for each sample
   * Variable C-2 frequency for each sample
   * More Effect Commands
   * Packed patterndata and samples
   * Configurable to match FastTracker/ScreamTracker/Protracker etc standards
   * Over 50 different options in the config.
   * All key shortcuts are reconfigurable
   * Longer samplenames/songname
   * Separate names on each channel and each pattern for easier identification
   * Special Module Description Editor for entering long descriptions of
     your music tune
   * Sample Editor
   * Position Editor
   * Advanced Split Keyboard Feature
   * MIDI styled keyboard (let's you press several keys simultaniously)
   * Loads AMS, MOD, S3M, STM, IFF, SMP and DP3
   * And of course alot more for you to discover!

 One thing that I should mention is that this tracker ONLY supports the
 Gravis Ultrasound. This seems to be the trend for the demo scene, and I
 can see why they would only support the GUS since it really is the
 standard. However, both Scream Tracker III and Fast Tracker 2 support
 the shitblaster series of cards.

 Interface
 ~~~~~~~~~
 When you first load up the tracker, you are presented with a beautiful
 interface. Everything really looks well placed. They make really good
 use of the mouse, there are scrollbars everywhere! However, when
 actually trying to use the tracker, I found the buttons (called
 "gadgets" in the documentation) kind of hard to read. It uses a font
 which looks kind of strange and there are pin-stripes throughout the
 screen which kind of make it look confusing compared to Fast Tracker 2
 and earlier releases of Extreme's Tracker. When I compare it to the
 previous release (v0.6a) I think that the screen is definitly a lot
 more difficult to read. The little pin-stripes and fancy graphics are
 kind of annoying. Luckily, according to the documentation, you can get
 rid of them by making use of the "configuration: color" feature.
 However, I wasn't successful when trying to do this.

 Maybe I just have bad eyes, but I also had difficulty reading the
 commands in the track pattern. Extreme Tracker uses a standard
 protracker command interface, but they have added an additional
 character to the field. As a result, a single row on the pattern field
 looks like this:

 Protracker : D-2 02 C10
 Extreme    : D-2 02 0C10
                     |
 notice the extra command character

 They added this extra character to allow for more commands instead of
 the standard protracker A through F command set. By using this extra
 character, Extreme Tracker offers other commands in addition to the
 protracker command set like:

 E8 00 - break sampleloop
 10 00 - play sample forwards
 10 01 - play sample backwards
 10 02 - enable bidirectional loop
 11 xx - extra fine slide up
 12 xx - extra fine slide down
 13 xy - retrig with volumeslide
 ...and others...

 Interesting stuff eh? I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm not sure
 how often I'd use those. :) I think that a better solution for adding
 additional commands would be to use the other letters of the alphabet,
 like: G-Z while still using the standard protracker A-F command set.
 This would have eliminated the need for the extra command character
 which I feel sort of crowds the command field.

 Unlike Scream Tracker III and Fast Tracker 2, Extreme Tracker does not
 have an extra volume field. This means that you will still have to use
 the protracker command (Cxx) to set the volume for your sample. I think
 that this is a major disadvantage because the extra volume field really
 makes things a LOT easier... However, Extreme tracker DOES support
 multiple commands per note (up to 7!). As an example, this means that
 you could port a note down, set the volume of it, and at the same time
 set its vibrato. I'm not sure how often I would use this feature, but
 its really nice to have for those few times that you need to apply more
 than one command to a note. Scream Tracker III does support this
 feature, but Fast Tracker 2 does not. Instead, Fast Tracker 2 supports
 the alternative: sample envelopes. Whether you would rather have
 multiple commands or sample envelopes is personal preference, but I
 would rather use multiple commands like Extreme Tracker supports. In
 addition, Extreme Tracker makes these multiple commands VERY easy to
 get to: simply click on the number thats at the top right of each
 track.

 While Extreme Tracker does not support sample envelopes like Fast
 Tracker 2, it does allow you to set the panning position for each
 sample. It also of course allows individual channel panning using the
 standard protracker E8x command (well, maybe not 100% standard).

 The Extreme tracker also has a couple of other unique features that I
 really like. Above each channel, there is a small description field so
 that you can give each channel your own description. As an example, the
 author of the example song that was included named his channels: Lead
 Sound, Drums+Roam, Roam+Drums, Cool Noise, Strings, Lead Sound2. This
 helps to keep everything in order. Also, Extreme Tracker has a seperate
 song description field. This allows the author of the song to include a
 lot of text about his song instead of putting all of the chatter in the
 sample names. :)

 Besides the things that I mentioned, Extreme Tracker seems to have a
 very nice to look at, easy to use, and functional interface. Its very
 similar to Fast Tracker 2 and uses mostly all of the same standard
 protracker keys.

 Sound Quality
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Well, considering that this tracker only supports the GUS, the sound
 quality is excellent. However, as you may know, some GUS players are
 better than others. I would say that Extreme Tracker has a fantastic
 GUS player, there are no annoying "ultraclicks", and I have yet to hear
 any random pops or whistles. :)

 Sample Editor
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I didn't have any luck getting this sample editor to work correctly. I
 was able to make samples, but they came out really shitty. I could only
 slightly make out the notes that I had sampled from my Korg. Obviously,
 they're still working on the sample editor. It looks like its going to
 be really nice when they get it finished, but for now, I'd advise not
 using it. Lets hope that they also put in a input level indicator (like
 in FT2) so that sampling is less of a hassle. If Extreme gets their
 sample editor fixed up, and they get all of the features working, I
 think that it may be better then the sample editor in Fast Tracker 2.

 Configuration
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is one of the best features of Extreme Tracker. Its configuration
 screen is very extensive and you can change nearly every aspect of its
 operation. If you find anything in the tracker to be annoying, chances
 are that you can fix it by changing something in the configuration
 screen. I'm not going to list everything here, except that I will say
 its the most extensive configuration that I have seen in a tracker. Its
 not quite as intuitive as the Fast Tracker 2 configuration, but it does
 let you have more control over the look and feel of the tracker than
 FT2 does. The only thing missing was the ability to change how many
 channels you want to have on the screen at once.

 Extreme Tracker also lets you change all of the colors in the tracker.
 It doesn't offer predefined palettes like Fast Tracker 2, but it does
 have very easy to use scrollbars to change the colors to your liking
 instantly.

 Now, one of my favorite things about the tracker! It allows you to
 change the key definitions to whatever you want! This is something that
 should be in every tracker. This means that you can change any command
 in the tracker to be activated by whatever keystroke you chose. If you
 wanted to use the Scream Tracker III block/copy command set, no
 problem! Simply scroll through the list of available commands, then
 click on one. At this point, Extreme Tracker will ask you to hit the
 key that you want to activate this command ...Incredible!

 Summary
 ~~~~~~~
 It looks like Extreme has developed a really nice tracker, and they've
 obviously put a lot of work into it. I think that it would be tough to
 decide which tracker is the best: Scream Tracker III, Fast Tracker 2,
 or Extreme Tracker. Each tracker offers so many things that make it
 unique and great. It all comes down to a matter of personal preference.
 I think that a lot of people will be using Extreme's Tracker because of
 its great configurability and its easy to use interface. Extreme
 Tracker also has great support for existing module formats (MOD, S3M,
 etc) and it doesn't choke on the S3Ms that Fast Tracker 2 seems to have
 so much trouble loading. Those that are used to the protracker command
 set will be right at home with Extreme Tracker. For people that
 didn't like FastTracker 2 because of its complexity and some of its
 deviations from what some people thought was "standard" for trackers,
 Extreme Tracker is a great alternative.

 Obviously, many of the features in both Extreme Tracker, and Fast
 Tracker 2 put it above of Scream Tracker III (ie: sample editor,
 panning options, configuration, Extreme's keyboard config, etc) but I
 think that Scream Tracker III will continue to be the standard for the
 demo scene, atleast for now. Reason being that Scream Tracker III was
 released at a time when everybody REALLY needed a good tracker. So many
 people are using ST3 now that it really has become the standard for the
 PC scene. ST3 has a totally different interface from both Extreme
 Tracker and Fast Tracker 2. In addition, it also uses a totally
 different command set. These trackers are so different that users of
 ST3 will probably not be inclined to switch to Extreme or FT2 so
 easily. Atleast, this is the way that I feel about it. I've been using
 ST3 for some time now, and I feel at home when using it. When I use
 Fast Tracker 2 or Extreme Tracker, I have a difficult time making music
 because everything is SO different. In addition, S3Ms are so widely
 supported that just about every good player supports them now.
 Nevertheless, both Extreme Tracker and FT2 really look neat, and I'm
 going to experiment with them a lot more.

 The way I see it, the music scene has three great trackers, and each of
 them will have equal amounts of supporters and bashers. Anyone read
 the debate between ST3 and FT2 in c.s.i.p.d lately?? I can't wait till
 Extreme Tracker gets added into these debates. :) About a year ago, I
 was sitting around using MMEdit wondering why the PC scene didn't have
 ANY good trackers. Well, now it seems that we've got three great
 trackers. Its about time! =)

(ASPHYXIA LIVES)                                         [Code Article 1 of 2]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Well, for my second article in this magazine, I have been asked to
  explain a bit more about Asphyxia and how we live.

  Asphyxia was formed about two years ago, just after our final school
  exams (end of grade 12/matric/standard 10/form 6 depending on where
  you live) The way it happened was like this : There was a beachfront
  braai (barbecue) held by a local BBS (Connectix). While there, I met
  this strange person calling himself EzE ... he seemed, like me, to
  be very interested in coding. During the course of the evening he
  got steadily smashed. When he was out of it, I wrote my name and number
  on his arm, and went home.

  A day later, I got a phonecall. "I don't know who you are, but I just
  found your name and number on my arm!" And so Asphyxia was born.

  He then introduced me to LiveWire, another coder, and our first intro
  was out in a few days. (All hail Norton Guides). (BTW, LiveWire later
  changed his name to GoTH)

  A few months later, we met a guy at a local computer club, who was a
  gaming fanatic. After meeting him a few times, I gave him a drawing
  program, a mouse, told him to draw something, and left. The pic he
  then gave me wasn't that bad, and he seemed to enjoy it. Fubar, the
  Asphyxia artist, was born.

  Here is a description of the lot of us :

    Grant "I had a weird childhood, it's amazing I'm sane" Smith
    AKA : Denthor
    Tall, dark and handsome. Well, two out of three ain't bad.
    Codes _lots_

    Peter "You have no idea how hard it is being an artist" Edwards
    AKA : EzE
    Short, blonde and handsome. Well, two out of three ain't bad.
    Codes, writes S3M's and is a heavy metal drummer

    Pieter "I'm so depressed, this'll never work" Buys
    AKA : Fubar
    Medium, dark and handsome. Yeah! 3 out of 3! A perfect score!
    Draws pictures. Plays games.

    Brian "All I need is a computer and the love of a good woman" Bailey
    AKA : GoTH
    Short, blond, and handsome. Ever heard of poetic licence?
    Codes, sometimes.

  Hmm. How do we live? We don't, we just exist from coffee cup to coffee
  cup.

  Let me list a typical conversation between us.

  Brian   : Grant, your damn code doesn't work!
  Grant   : Yes it does, I'm sure it does.
  Brian   : Nope, it's crap.
  Peter   : Umm, guys.
  Pieter  : Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
  Peter   : Does it work with range checking?
  Grant   : Wow! Cool! It does. Fancy that!
  Brian   : (very softly) Um, I think I know what the problem is.
  All     : (Except Brian) What?
  Brian   : Um, never mind...
  Grant   : It couldn't _possibly_ be your sound code, could it.
  Brain   : ...
  Peter   : Oh, god, not again.
  Grant   : And you said it was _my_ code, HAH!
  Brain   : Well it wasn't _my_ fault the docs are wrong.
  Peter   : (Sotto voce) Yeah right.

  Pieter  : Guys, could you handle a solid background while that effect
            is going on in the foreground?
  Brian   : No!
  Grant   : Yes!
  Peter   : Maybe...??
  Pieter  : Oh, god, not again.

  Grant   : I feel like some milk.
  Peter   : What? You feel like milk? You don't look like milk.
  Grant   : Yep, I keep on thinking I'm inside a cow.
  Pieter  : Oh, god, not again.

  Hmmm ... people seem to be quite surprised when we say we are democoders
  from South Africa. Here are a few examples :

  American (through internet email) : Have you ever heard of ID Software,
                                      or Doom? Do you have electricity? How
                                      do you code?
  Denthor  : Yep, I have even heard of the internet! Of course, coding is
             quite difficult. My dad has to hook up the battery of our
             chevy to the generator in order to get enough power to my
             286. It isn't so bad, if you don't mind the noise of the
             diesel generator. The only problem is, I can't code at night
             because we need the power for lights, cooking and so forth.

  In actual fact, we aren't that backwards. At university, I use a lan
  with about 30 486's, with a dedicated net link. There are (gosh) high
  concrete buildings in Durban, and the most exciting recent development was
  the lift.

  EzE and I have to go off now and take a cold shower. We've been talking
  about Gabrielle Anwar, and we just can't take it anymore!

  See you next week!

                Date Uploaded: This is the date at which the file was
                               uploaded.

 [I would rather have the date of the newest file in the archive here, rather
 than they day it was uploaded.  Some of the files have been moved and/or
 copied or re-archived.  This has made the uploaded date innacurate.  Also,
 some areas of the world would see 01/02/94 as January 2, 1994, others would
 see it as February 1, 1994.  Because of this, I would rather we have the
 date in <MONTH DAY, YEAR> format.]

                Description:   A Fairly detailed description of the purpose of
                               the code.
                FileSize:      Gives the person a fair idea of the size of the
                               file.
                Languages:     A box is ticked by a 'x' or if the CODE is
                               made for a not so popular demo coding langauge
                               or is just a text document or something along
                               the lines of that.

 [Lets use a 'x' instead of the checkmard symbol.  We need to stick to
 standard ASCII.]

                Compiler:      The necessary Compiler and Version number
                               used to compile the code.
        Ratings:
                Coding:        General quality of the coding. Spagetti and
                               confusing codes will get a low rating, however
                               a nicely set out, nicely structured and
                               occompanied comments will get a high rating.
                Documentation: A rating of the documention supplied with the
                               code. eg. A well written, easy to understand
                               documention which takes the time to explain the
                               workings of the code gets a high rating.
                Portability:   This is a rating of the portability of the code
                               itself. eg. An ASM Library that is easy to
                               add addional code will get a high rating,
                               however a piece of code which requires a whole
                               re-write because it uses a weird technique will
                               score a low rating.

                OverAll:       My overall rating of the code. Not calculated
                               or anything but, just how well written the
                               entire file is.

                               eg. A nice piece of well documented, well coded
                               , new technology, easy portablilty will receive
                               a high rating. However a TEXT library that uses
                               direct video accessing, which everyman, women,
                               dog, cat, and fish, knows will obviously
                               receive a low rating.

        an example of a rating is:

                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
                Coding            - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxù   96 %
                Documentation     - xxxxxxx ù ù ù ù ù ù   42 %
                Understandablity  - xxxxxxxxxxx ù ù ù ù   60 %
                Portability       - xxxxxxxxxxxxx ù ù ù   78 %

                Overall           - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ù ù   80 %

 [Once again, we need to keep the high-ASCII out, so I have changed this a
 bit.]

    I have been writing a Source Code Editor for a while now (on and off). The
program which I will call (Code-Edit).
    Code Edit will provide the user with a text-mode environment with colors,
allowing the user to highlight the code and comments. It will use similar key
combinations as Q-EDIT and have a modern'er look. The user will also be able
to export the file to a normal text file to compile. I've had the idea for
a while and have never got around to finishing it.
    Well, you're probably wondering what the hell has this to do with DEMONEWS
??. My idea was to provide the writers of demonews, with a similar program to
C-EDIT and a file-viewer for the viewers. This way it can add to the look of
the magazine. A text file could also be exported so people with Mono screens
can view it.

 [This sounds like a great idea.  Please send the program to me so I can try
 it out.]

 ---- Introduction ----

 Hi, this is an article about me (Stony), the art manager for hand-drawn
 graphics for the new gfx section in DemoNews.  I'm a gfx-artist in the
 demo-scene and do hand-drawn gfx.  My job here will be something like
 discussing certain paint-programs/utilities, giving my opinion on GFX,
 helping with questions, etc.

 ---- Background ----

 I started drawing back in 1988 on my first PC, a 8088 XT with 'real' color
 CGA monitor.  My first paint program was an IBM StoryBoard in which only
 keyboard input could be used for drawing and no menu was used.  All
 functions had to be done via <Alt> and <Ctrl>.  In this program I made my
 first pictures from The Flintstones and The Simpsons, all in a resolution
 of 320x200 with 4! colors.  These pictures were saved binary with a size of
 16384.  I used those pictures to make some 'real' intros in BASIC.

 I also used Dynamic Publisher which was delivered with my XT and
 found out that a mouse could be handy so I bought my first mouse after
 a few months of saving money.  Mice were expensive those days you know!
 I then got Dr. Genius with my mouse.  This was a drawing program in which
 I made some logos and faces for fun and again in CGA 4c mode.  I did all
 this together with a nephew of mine who had the same computer as I did.
 I was doing it all under the handle Mr. Stone from which I have derived
 my current handle, Stony.

 After this paint program I got a new version of IBM Storyboard which
 used a mouse and had an easy menu interface.  In this version, I had
 the ability to make my own fonts and patterns (which is very handy if
 you only have 4 colors).  I continued drawing logos and funny faces.
 In this period I started making Slide-Show with use of the paint program.
 I ripped (oh oh :) ) some pictures out of some games I had (Defender of
 the Crown and Larry 1) and made some funny things with them.

 Then a friend of mine got an Amiga 500 with Deluxe Paint and I started
 drawing some gfx on an Amiga, I could use 64 colors which was a
 huge amount to me.  Then I got myself the PC version of Deluxe Paint in
 which I only could use 4 colors but I was able to change the background
 color in one of the standard colors and so I was able to make nice
 gfx.  In here I made landscapes with mountains and seas!

 In 1991, I bought myself a 386 with a VGA card that allowed me to use
 256 colors out of a palette of 262,144!  In this period I started
 making slide-shows and presentations with real drawn animations as well
 as digitized animation for companies which I did in cooperation with a
 company. In this period I made:

   - 'De Schreeuw van de Leeuw : The Slide Show ' : A slide-show of
      a very good Dutch comedian.  This was almost totally done with a
      video-digitizer and was of poor quality.
   - 'Niece Sue 1 and 2 ' : Two GL files for a shareware company with
      the known theme of most of GL files.
   - 'Terminator 2 Show ': An animation with some parts of the original
      movie.
   - 'The little Man ' : A drawn animation about a little man.
   - 'Van de Heuvel : Aannemersbedrijf ' : A presentation about a Dutch
      company in which was showed what kind of activities they did.

 Last year, when I started studying Computer Science, I joined II Static,
 a underground-group, as gfx-artist.  Here I started using the handle Stony.
 For this I made logos, ansis and asciis.  I also made a small X-Mas 1993
 intro for them with some snowy logos and a selfmade X-mas font.  Then in
 February this year II Static quit the underground scene and I and another
 member joined the Demo-Scene in an already existing group Trance which
 has been on the Amiga for quite some time and the Dutch PC division
 started also this February.  My first demo-scene addition was me taking
 part in the Bizarre'94 gfx-compo with three pix called:

   - 'Raging' : a pic with a strangle of objects and a sort of a symbolic in
      it.
   - 'Konigstuhl' : a pic of which I got the inspiration from a place which
      I visited with my holidays in 1993 in Germany.
   - 'Alley' : an alley with a downward view upon a city.

 I'm now also drawing for a German group called Xtended Fantasies.  I met
 them at this party.  Maybe I'll even join them as gfx-artist as well.
 After this I've done some pics, logos for use with Trance and some logos
 for some people who wanted one for use in an intro.  I'm also busy now
 with some drawings for a historical musea.

 After the summer holidays I read something about the demo-cd and that
 some gfx-artists were needed.  So I sent some examples and they appeared to
 be nice enough!  The CD is released with a CD print done by me and in
 the intro I had some logos.

 After this project Snowman asked me if I wanted to become an art manager
 for hand-drawn gfx and this is where it got me.

 ---- About GFX in the demo Scene ----

 As a real demo-freak I have seen a lot of demos in the past and will
 see a lot of new demos in the future.

 As GFX-Artist I crittically look to the GFX in demos like a coder looking
 to the difficulty about how the demo has been coded.

 My opinion is that the GFX-Scene inside the demo-scene is being seen as
 a minor part.  This is my conclusion after I've been to Bizarre '94, where
 the graphics competition was held in the middle of the night.
 I thought that it was kind of unprecedented to have a GFX article in a
 magazine, so I was really shocked when Snowman asked me to help out.
 However, a lot of time is being put into graphics, so I feel it was a good
 choice.

 I think that GFX-Compos need to have more specific rules.  For example,
 the maximum resolution and number of colors must be set.  This is because
 GFX done on at high resolutions look sharper but don't require any skills
 of making a picture look sharper.  If the maximum resolution were set very
 high, then everyone would think 'Oh well, just scan something on my 24-bit
 flatscanner and I have a nice picture!'  I think if this was allowed, the
 GFX-Scene soon would be gone because everyone can scan a picture.
 Another good rule would be to have 'original' pictures.  I have seen a lot
 of GFX from GFX-Compos which were taken from comic books, CD Covers, etc.
 People can just think 'I'm out of ideas, I'll just redraw a picture.'

 My future view about the GFX-Scene is also very positive.  I think that in
 the future the GFX-Artists will keep existing.  There are a lot of good
 GFX-Artists now and there will be in the future, also because we aren't
 dependent on certain systems/processors etc.  We are 'compatible' with all
 systems :)

 I myself hope to stay in the demo-scene for a very long time, active or
 non-active.  My skills keep growing and growing, and I learn a lot from
 other gfx, special techniques and styles etc.  I started with CGA and
 learned everything from the beginning.  I really enjoy drawing.

 ---- End sentences ----

 Well this was the article about me, a short introduction about who I am
 and what I am going to do in the future in DemoNews and Hornet.

 You'll be hearing from me again.

 Greets, Stony.

(no more ansi)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This week, the ANSI files we be taking off HORNET.  We do not have the
 resources to keep these online anymore.  By deleting the ANSI, we have freed
 up nearly 40 Megs.  Since we only have about 340 to work with, this is a big
 gain.

 Any flames concerning this will be forwarded to /dev/nul.

((Section 8...ESCAPE Demo/Music CD)) Its OUT!
==============================================================================
[From Snowman]

 This past Monday, I receieved 15 copies of the Escape Demo CD.  Although I
 may be a bit bias in this, I think they are GREAT!  It was really cool
 listening to the winning songs of MC][ through my Cd player rather than my
 GUS.  My relatives and friends seem puzzled (they can't really figure out
 what the cd IS), but they see my name on it and smile.  :)

 I will be sending out 2 of my copies this week: one to Royal, and the other
 to the MC][ winner.

 DemoNews is getting quite huge!  This issue is pushing the 64k barrier.  Not
 too bad for a weekly newsletter IMO, but I fear if it gets much bigger, it
 will start bouncing from some people's mailers.  To prevent this, you have
 my assuance that DemoNews will remain under 64,000 bytes.

 This week, Ryan's articles totalled about 23k.  I am going to have to say
 something to him about this.  :)

The quote for this week comes from Gene Roddenberry in the Star Trek The

  "The Starship Enterprise is not a collection of motion picture sets or a
   model used in visual effects.  It is a very real vehicle; one designed
   for storytelling."
