Once upon a time (around March I think) a local sysop challenged me to 
crack his friend's password on the local high school (Monte Vista, 
monte.mvhs.srvusd.k12.ca.us, running Ultrix v4.1). So I get in, get
root (sysop access), and look at the password file. Unix passwords are
scrambled with a one-way encryption method. Say your password is "fuckchop".
It's stored in the password file as "hdVcOLOsIcvLE". When you login to a 
unix system instead of decrypting the password it encrypts what you type
in and matches it with the stored encrypted password. So to crack passwords
you need a program such as CrackerJack that will go through a long list of
words (a password dictionary). I couldn't crack the guy's password so I 
deleted his account and told the local sysop there never was one 
(situation averted). So I make a few accounts, Bluesman gets on the system
and we start looking through people's mail (this is where that "Chia Pet" 
letter from Delirium Issue #4 came from) when suddenly a root account 
(chatter) starts paging me. Here's a log of the ntalk conversation with 
"Anirvan Chatterjee" (formatted for the sake of reading):

Then I kill all his processes and change the root password. Again, 
situation averted. 10 minutes later he unmounts the drives.
The next morning he tells the computer lab who did it ("Acidflux, Bluesman
and Deadlocke [aka Silicon [)ragon]"... like I said, I made a few accounts 
while I was on) and that we hacked in to use thier link to the Lawerence 
Livermore Labs (local nuclear facility... anyone read The Cuckoo's Egg?). 
On top of that Bluesman logged in from a New York system so Anirvan starts 
talking like MOD was after his ass (This was in the California Bay Area BTW). 
That afternoon Anirvan gets a call from a Monte Vista freshman named 
Brett Nelson posing as me. He says "This is Acidflux, you will recieve a 
call at 9pm tonight" along w/ some veiled threats and whatnot. They 
recognized his voice and kicked him out of school (I think this story has a 
moral in it somewhere). A couple months later the system is back up and I 
find this article on Anirvan's Webpage (http://192.188.37.4/~anirvan):
  

"Beyond Wargames"
by Anirvan Chatterjee (`95)

   Net historians record the sudden increase in destructive net
   activities after the release of Wargames (the seminal cracker-as-hero
   movie, the tale of an antisocial nerdy 80s teen equipped with a modem
   who stumbles onto the secrets of a corrupt military establishment (see
   also, Sneakers)). Those were the days when cracker and darkside
   hackers were truly dangerous only to government and corporate America.
   Well, think again. While corporate network security has increased
   severalfold since then, the massive growth rate of the Internet won't
   be able to extend the same degree of protection to newcomers unable to
   obtain the best protection money can buy. I speak from experience,
   having gone through two such cases recently, both very close to home.

   Everybody probably knows about the cracker intrusion into Monte
   Vista's computer network. (You don't? The Reader's Digest Condensed
   Book editionI was online at Monte Vista from home on a Friday night
   when I saw someone else, a friend of mine, logged in too. I tried to
   "talk" to her online, but she didn't respond. So I was doing some
   routine system maintenance, when I saw a strange call to talk from
   someone logged in as the system operator--but I was the system
   operator. Oh well, I ignored it, until my friend finally agreed to
   talk to me. She seemed rather confused, didn't understand who I was. I
   tried asking her what she was planning to do this weekend. Suddenly,
   she burst into a rant along the lines of "I am elite! I broke into
   your system! Hahaha!" By this time, I'd realized that "she" was
   somebody who had broken in under that account, and broken into the
   system operator's account. We did some online jousting, (by now I had
   Charlie Hsu, speaking voice, advising me on the fax line) until I
   managed to remotely shut down the Monte Vista network, but only to
   find that he'd deleted my account, my email, my projects, my web
   page--everything. Talk about playing the martyr for my system. (Yes,
   yes, the proper authorities have been contacted, and they're working
   hard, trying to catch the evildoers.) Anyway, there's my story. Now
   you can laugh at it.)

   But after all that, who to blame? The cracker, certainly, but also the
   cluelessness of the newbie system administrators (including yours
   truly) who just didn't know enough to implement current and effective
   security measures. That, and insecure usage habits on the part of so
   many equally clueless users ignoring even the most simple warnings
   about password security (a computer network is only as strong as its
   weakest password). As long as the Internet keeps expanding at such
   furious rates and the age, maturity, education, training, and
   all-around cluefulness of the average user keeps declining, this will
   keep growing as an issue.

   Net.access is getting easier and easier to obtain, and security
   measures from many established, otherwise clueful net.folks are being
   correspondingly toned down to fit the minimal effort/maximum personal
   gain philosophy of many coming online for the first time (the same
   type of people who will break every point of net.courtesy to get
   information, rather than checking documentation, FAQs (Frequently
   Asked (and Answered) Question lists), or contacting their local system
   administrator). (For example, Microsoft Bob's password protection will
   automatically let you change it if you guess incorrectly three times
   in a row--even a four-year-old could get past that kind of
   protection!)

   I found out very recently that my Internet carrier's security could be
   easily compromised, not online, but through what crackers call "social
   engineering"--by breaking in through their customer support. January
   31, someone posing as the cracker who broke into Monte Vista called my
   house and left me a voice message instructing me to wait for a call at
   9:00 p.m. if I wanted to recover my password. I tried dialing into my
   account, and found my password to be invalid--someone had changed it!
   Of course, I didn't believe that the caller was who he claimed to be
   for a second--he had pronounced my name correctly. Nobody ever
   pronounces my name correctly after having only seen the spelling, so I
   knew it had to be someone who knew me. And who had something against
   me. I listened to the message again (the idiot had done me a huge
   favor by leaving a long snippet of his voice digitally recorded for me
   to listen to again and again) when I realized who it was--an annoying
   Monte Vistan I'd busted and kicked off the Monte Vista network a few
   months ago, for some truly unsavory activities he'd gotten into, all
   the system rules he'd violated. I contacted my Internet carrier's
   support staff, and hooked up with a rather clueful administrator, who
   traced the breakin. I was informed that someone calling in from the
   local dial-in node had accessed my account (when I had been hours away
   from the nearest modem), and deleted all the files in it. Damn! Damn!
   Damn!

   As we retraced the cracker's steps, we found that the [please
   substitute a handful of your favorite explicit pejoratives here] had
   unsuccessfully tried to access my account at 11:00 a.m. (why wasn't he
   at school during 4th period? note network knowledge has little
   correlation with common sense, intelligence, or academic achievement),
   then spoke to someone on the support staff between then and 1:00 p.m.,
   convincing them that he was me. Then the "helpful" support staff
   changed my password for "me," as soon as the intruder was able to
   pronounce my name correctly, and give them my phone number and
   address. Once he had BS'ed his way past their safeguards, he then
   asked them to change "his" password for him, as he had "forgotten" it.
   Devious little [choose your own again], eh? Then a little before 1:00
   p.m., and again at 1:40, p.m. he logged in under my account, with the
   new (now changed) password. He went through all my files. Then he
   deleted everything: my saved mail, my notes, my projects, my backups.
   And as if that wasn't enough, he then proceeded to browse through
   through my email. By this time in the conversation with the tech
   admin, I was seething. Luckily for me, the guy was able to restore
   most of my files and mail from system backups made the Friday before.
   So I didn't lose too much, but that's beside the point. I felt so
   violated. Nobody should be able to go through my email and files,
   reading and deleting at will, invading my privacy; there's a world of
   difference between system operators doing routine checks, and
   intruders breaking in as part of some sick revenge fantasy. So I
   registered several "secure" codewords with the support staff (my
   mother's maiden name, etc.) that they would have to get from anyone
   calling for support under my name. And that was that.

   Yes, yes, the cracker, a (now "former"?) Monte Vista student, has been
   caught and arrested, for his numerous ugly computer-related crimes
   (physical theft of computer equipment is a rather silly idea if you
   want to stay on the good side of the law), and I have the oddest
   feeling I may have seen the last of him. But it's not the [yet another
   pejorative here] himself I'm so concerned about, as much as the trend
   he's running on. Online interaction has become so easy and widespread
   that it seems as if anybody with something against you could take
   action against you. And the more business that we conduct online, the
   more dangerous it is (I've purchased several items directly on the
   Internet over the course of the last year, using unencrypted credit
   card numbers--dangerous, I know.) From mailbombings and anonymous
   flames, canceled postings, forged mail or postings, to outright
   electronic intrusion, almost anything is possible. Take Kevin Mitnick,
   the recently captured master cracker who infiltrated sites in the
   hundreds, from the accounting records of Netcom (the nation's largest
   Internet Service Provider, and very possibly the least-liked (for its
   anarchic administration and dumbed-down service)) to the Well,
   arguably the coolest and most respected Service Provider in America,
   the home of the Net's "cultural elite" (synonymous with its technical
   elite). News reports say his breakins weren't "personal." God help
   anybody who pissed him off. Interestingly enough, at least three
   movies about the Internet are now filming. One of these is The Net,
   about someone who's very identity is tampered with when police,
   credit, and other identity records are all altered. As technically
   improbable as the plot is, the concept is definitely sound (recall the
   case of the vengeful phone phreaker who rerouted his parole officer's
   home phone to a (900) sex number). This stuff doesn't just happen to
   other people. Let the netizen beware. Tough times lie ahead.

   An aside: Don't let this article scare you into not getting online.
   Accessing the Internet is a fabulous experience, and not akin to war
   as my words might lead you to believe; it just requires some common
   sense. As long as you have your wits about you, and aren't afraid to
   turn to manuals or your friendly neighborhood system administrator for
   help, you'll be OK. Interested in getting online? Do ask me, or
   someone else with online experience for help. I love helping people,
   but I'd much rather be able to help someone before s/he actually
   commits her time and money to problematic, expensive commercial
   networks.

Then I find this followup letter:


   Dear Geek-meister:

   Enjoyed your latest issue. A couple of philosophical and technical
   notes you may wish to ponder:

   (1) Re: Anirvan's tome on Internet security, There's a consistent
   assumption that the crackers he describes in the article are male. How
   did the author know? Did "he" write about hunting giraffes? Use locker
   room humor (actually, I've heard enough qualifying material from
   females during stints at MV to dispel any such assumption)? How many
   readers just read along and assumed, along with the author, that the
   "perp" wears pants (oops), make that Jockeys (nope) boxers? (yikes),
   buttons left over right (okay, I think).

   My purpose here is not to pick on AC--indeed, I think his energy,
   intellectual curiosity and considerable erudition in publishing
   Paradox are really laudable. I just think we should all ferret out,
   consider and overcome creeping sexism wherever we find it.

.oOo.

Sorry if this has been more self-glorifying than informative but after 
seeing Anirvan's side of the story I had to type this up. I'm going to
go have a coke and a smile so I'm ending the story here. Watch out
for that creeping sexism.

                     The Phone Losers Of America Present                      
          Taking Over Fred Meyers From The Comfort Of Your Own Home           

This is a little incident that happened while I was living in Portland, Oregon
and a few people said I should write about it so I am so be happy. Most people 
who don't live in Portland have never heard of a Fred Meyers so I'll tell you 
what it is first. It's like a big chain of big stores in Portland. I'm not
sure exactly where else in the United States they exist but I had never seen
or heard about one until I moved to Oregon. 

Take a Wal-Mart and a very large grocery store and add a few extra things and
you've got a Fred Meyers. They've got a huge grocery section, lawn & garden,
a huge hardware store built in, electronics, music, software, videos, a deli,
sometimes a big built-in eating area and a lot of other things that I'm 
probably leaving out. All in all it's not a bad store but that didn't stop
what I did to them.

Keep in mind that at the time all of this happened the employees of Fred
Meyers were all on strike and they had a bunch of temporary people working in
the stores and nobody there really knew what was going on anyways so that just
added even more fun to the whole event.

The Discovery:
-------------
Me and my girlfriend (Colleen Card) were walking around the Fred Meyers 
located at Gateway Shopping Center, shopping and eventually got separated. 
Since I walked all over the store and couldn't find her (not surprising seeing 
as how the store is the size of a mini-mall) I figured I'd pick up one of the 
paging phones that are located on posts every few isles for employees and 
announce all over the store for her to meet me in a certain place.

I found the phone and picked it up and looked at the HUGE list of all the
different departments they have to choose from and finally found the All Store
Page listed at 1800. So I dial 1800 and hear a loud click throughout the store
and I annouce, "Colleen Card to the toy isle. Colleen Card!" 

While I was waiting for her, though, the Matchbox cars got really boring by 
myself (Justin's dad, the kid I met and was playing with, made him go home) so 
I wandered back over to the phone and noticed that all the department numbers
were in the exact same format as the all store paging number. Electronics was
1296, Hardware was 1693, etc, etc. So I wrote down the two phone numbers
listed on the front of that phone and put them in my pocket. Colleen arrived
and we went home to a supper of Burger King Whoppers. Yeah.

The First Phone Call:
--------------------
By now I had this big horrific plan in my head that I was pretty sure wouuldn't
work but I knew I wouldn't rest until I tried it so the next morning while
Colleen was at school I went back to the same Gateway Fred Meyers to test it
out. (Gee, have you figured out what I'm doing yet?) I went to the pay phone
that's located in a foyer entrance type thing and boxed a call to the inside
of the store.

  "Fred Meyers customer service, may I help you?"
  "Yeah, this is Dave in electronics. Could you transfer me to extension 
1800? I can't get it to work..."
  "Okay, just a minute, please!"

I hear the funky Fred Meyers hold music for a split second and then total,
dead silence. I hit the "*" button and hear it echo inside the store... So I
look around the foyer and there's a few people inside with me so I can't
really say anything loud. Instead I start playing "Help Me Rhonda" on with the
touch tones and my musical masterpiece echos throughout the entire store.

I couldn't wait any longer for the people in there to leave so in a low voice
I start muttering into the phone, "Fuck you alllll...You're all going to hell.
I will kill yoooooou, I am Satan......." Now you'll have to excuse the total
lack of creativity with my first Fred Meyers speach but I couldn't talk very
loud and besides, I was excited that this actually worked! I decided to go
inside and check out the reactions so I hung up.

The reactions weren't that great when I first got in. Walking by the photo
section I heard a customer exclaim to an employee, "Did you hear that crazy
guy??" But the employee wasn't too talkative so that didn't get anywhere. When
I got to the Deli, things were considerably more active there. A guy in a suit
(didn't look like a manager, but who knows...) was talking to another 
important looking guy (security?) and the suit was pissed!

I went over to the Deli and pretended to look at the menus so I could listen
and they were talking about me. I heard a few things to the effect of, "Well,
Dan's looking around for him right now." and "If I catch the little fucker..."
It turned out that they thought some kid in the store had picked up a paging
phone and done it all. Then I noticed a few guys patroling the isles with
2-way radios on their belts. Typical security dudes. So I got bored and went
back home, waiting for Colleen to get home.

The Twenty Minute Broadcast:
---------------------------
Later that evening, around 6:00 I had already told Colleen that I'd succeeded
and wanted to try it again so we picked up the phone in her room and called
Fred Meyers. Again I got the service desk, asked to be transferred to extension
1800, got hold music and then dead silence.

The first thing I yelled into the phone was, "DON'T SHOP FRED MEYERS!" That
was the big slogan in town that the employee who were on strike were using so
I thought that would liven up the whole strike thing and if nothing, make the
local papers. I put on my Good Morning Vietnam CD which starts out with Robin
Williams yelling, "Goooooood morning, Vietnam!" and plays the clips of all his
best radio stuff, including all the foul language and bad jokes.

Then I played a few good clips from The Jerky Boys's first cassette and started
paging people to different departments of the store. After about twenty
minutes I hung up the phone so I could call back and make sure I was really on
the paging system and not just talking to myself like an idiot. So I called
back.

  "Fred Meyers, customer service. May I help you?"
  "Could I have the shoe department, please?"
  "Hold please!"

After about a minute of waiting, I finally got the shoe department. I told the
lady I was Dan from security upstairs and asked her if someone was playing
with her phone there on the paging system.

  "Oh no, sir! That wasn't from this phone. They think it was kids in the
food isle. The security guys are looking for them right now..."

The Two Hour Broadcast:
----------------------
I thanked her and hung up. Now we knew we were getting through okay so I 
called them back and once again asked customer service to connect me to 
extention 1800. By this time I guess she had figured it out because she wouldn't
connect me so instead I asked her to connect me to Lawn & Garden. When they
answered, I had them connect me to 1800 with no problems.

The only thing I can't figure out is why when I was in their system they
couldn't somehow get rid of me. Why couldn't they shut off their all store
paging system? Why couldn't they disconnect the speakers? Why couldn't they
pull the plugs on the phone for a second and then put them back in? Why 
couldn't they just hang up on line two? Anyway, here's a breakdown of what
our two hour broadcast consisted of:


1. Various type of store pages including....
   "Customer Service to the sexual toys isle!"
   "Customer Service to the anal lubrication department!"

   the wording around to make them quite demented and gross. (This is where
   PLA024.TXT came from, by the way...)
3. Harmonica Hour! Together on harmonica we didn't sound that great but that
   didn't stop us...that alone probably got rid of most of the shoppers.
4. Voiced our opinions of political issues. 
5. Told very anti-religious and racist jokes. (We're not against religion and
   not racist people, we were just trying our best to offend everyone.)
6. I played my favorite songs over the store via the local radio station, KUFO.
7. A special announcement by RBCP: "Ladies & Gentlemen, may I have your
   attention please...At this moment I'd like you all to direct your attention
   to the individual working in Lawn & Garden. She is the very person who
   screwed up and allowed us to take over your paging system! Not that bright
   of an employee if you ask me but hey, we're dealing with Fred Meyers, 
   right? So ma'am, if you haven't been fired yet...Thank You!"
8. Colleen sang "I'm a Little Teapot" while I yelled "Fuck God!", then she
   started reading off phone sex ads. Then poetry.


Transferring The Call Ourselves:
-------------------------------
Me & Colleen went to Gateway again. After getting on their paging system so
many times, they must have put out a big-time security alert or something
because NO department would transfer us anymore so now I HAD to get it just to
show them. Here's what we did...

1. We find a phone in Isle 13 and write down the extension number off of it.
2. I stay there and Colleen runs out to the pay phone.
3. Colleen boxes a call to Fred Meyers and asks customer service for extension
   1625, which is where I'm standing.
4. My phone begins to ring. I pick it up, dial TRANSFER, 1800 and hang up.
5. I run out to the pay phone and we say a few things into the phone such as
   "Ha, ha! We got through! Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!" and other assorted
   immature things.
6. We get kind of bored and go home. But it WORKED! Ha!

A few days later we called from home and asked to be transferred to extension
1625. A stock boy picked up the phone and we told him exactly what to press
and we got on again. They'll never win.

Interview With The Security:
---------------------------
After that night it got sort of boring. I was a little upset that none of this
made the papers and we never got around to doing it much more after that. Once
while Colleen & her dad was in another Fred Meyers shopping, I got in and
made a few announcements, played a few touch tone songs, etc, but their system
was messed up and they couldn't hear me very well.

So one day I'm hanging around the Portland PDX airport because I have nothing
better to do. One thing has led to another and I'm sitting at a pay phone,
using the fingernail clippers that I stole from the gift shop to splice open
the wires to the pay phone. (They wires were just shoved up under the pay
phone wall and easy to get to. I had access to three different phones, 
including my own.) I didn't mean to, but instead of just stripping the outer
cover off the wires, I cut it totally in half. I quickly learned which phone
it was when the Japanesse girl next to me looked distressed, started yelling
something urgent in the phone, then hung up and went to find antoher phone.
Whoops?

So I finally get my phone and the phone next to me successfully hooked 
together. I called Zak and explained to him what I'd done. Then I patched in
the other dial tone and called Fred Meyers in Beaverton. We had no problem
getting in to their all store paging. We fucked around for awhile on their
system and got bored with it so Zak used HIS three-way to call up the
Gateway Fred Meyers. We asked the customer service lady for security.

  "Security, may I help you?"
  "Yes, this is Roy from the Orgonian Newspaper. I was calling in regards to
your problems that I've been hearing about with your paging system?"
  "Well, sir, that's a problem that has been taken care of. Is what was
happening is some kids were dialing in from the outside..." Blah blah blah,
he rattled on for awhile.

After he babbled on for awhile and I asked him some more questions, I asked,
"Sir, are you aware that you're participating in a four-way phone call and
right now as we speak, our voices are echoing throughout the bowels of Fred
Meyers in Beaverton? Now, you say that you're security for Gateway Fred
Meyers, correct?" The line was totally silent after that, then it clicks and
he's hung up, probably franticly calling Gateway to find out if it's true. I
then made an announcement, "Yes, shoppers of Fred Meyers, this is the kind of
intelligent people that you're dealing with every day, shopping here!"

We hung up and Zak called Fred's back to ask the lady if we were really on
the system. She verified that we were so we asked to be transferred to 1800
and she told us to please hold. 
  "Security, may I help you?"
  "No, she must have misunderstood us. We didn't want security, we wanted
extension 1800 so we can frollic around your paging system freely!"
  "Well, sir, I don't think that's going to happen."

Another incident with security happened when I called security from Clackamas
Town Center, just out of boredom. (The very mall that Tonya Harding likes to
skate in, by the way! Boy, do I feel important.) I called Gateway security and
had a long conversation with the security lady. I told her I was the one
responsible and she said, "I know, I have the same number on my Caller I.D.
here." which is bullshit because I'd never called Fred's from that Mall.
  "Well, ma'am, did you think what I did was funny?"
  "No, not at all, actually."
  "I bet you smiled, though..."
  "Well, yeah, until you started getting vulgar. You really upset quite a
few shoppers here."
  "That was my plan, though."
  "Why?"
  "Because I have no life."

Afterwards:
----------
I know the story just kind of ended there and didn't really have any kind of
point to begin with but I thought I'd write it to see what you think. (Which
is probably that we all need to get a life.) Since that day we've been on the
paging systems of various stores around Portland, saying pretty much the same
things each time. It actually gets old after awhile but it's really fun at
first. I severely shocked the shit out of myself trying to hook another pay
phone to my original two so don't try that unless you're wearing big rubber
yellow gloves! It never did make the paper that I'm aware of and the strike is
over and things are pretty much back to normal there. So if you want to call
Fred's and try it yourself, feel free!

K-Mart uses a similar phone system nationwide but I never have been able to
get into their paging system. Actually, I've never been able to get into any
other store except for Fred's so please mail me if you get anywhere with
other stores. Wal-Mart, perhaps?

Phone Numbers:
-------------
Gateway Fred Meyers...............................................503-254-7905
Beaverton Fred Meyers.............................................503-690-5823
Rockwood Fred Meyers..............................................503-669-4600

There's a billion others in Portland, but those are just the ones I have 
listed and I'm too lazy to dial information. The paging code for most of them
is 1800, but Rockwood for some reason is 800. If you want Isle 13 at Gateway,
the extention is 1625. (Talk to a dumb stock boy!) I don't encourage actually
doing this, but think it would be funny as hell.

Happy Valintines Day! This file is for all of you wanna-be cool system hackers 
and crackers but don't have the slightest idea what you're doing. Well here's 
your chance to be a real hacker. In addition to the axe method, I've included
some secret WWIV commands that even Wayne Bell might not be aware of. Cactus?

Tools You Need:
--------------
 (1) Ladder
 (1) Ax (or hedge trimmers if you want to be creative)
 (1) Sysop you don't really like

What To Do:
----------
Log on to your hated WWIV board under a false alias and start chatting up the
sysop. Be really nice to him and ask for your own sub and upload a lot of 
files and offer advice on ways to better his board and just be a really, 
really nice guy.

After you gain his trust, find out through social engineering when him and
all the other members of his family are going to be gone for an hour or so.
Stake out across the street and wait for him to leave.

Now, when they're all gone take your hacking equipment to his house. Use the
ladder to climb up to his window and shatter it with your ax. (The window,
not the ladder.) Climb into his room. If his room is in the basement, walk 
downstairs. Of course, you could have just broken into the basement window
but that would have been too easy and only a true dedicated hacker would do
it this way.

Find his computer. If someone is logged on hit F10 to go into chat mode and
type, "I'M SORRY BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LOG YOU OFF SO I CAN HACK THIS
BOARD." Log the loser, I mean user off and proceed to hack. Hold the ax high
over your head and bring it down with as much force as possible on his 
computer to hack a big gash in the middle of it. Hack all of his WWIV backup
disks, his monitor and his keyboard. Oh, and the modem. Hack everything that
has to do with WWIV to bits. 

After you're all done hacking, you could format his C: drive although it's
not really neccessary. Now you can brag to all your friends about what a cool 
hacker you are. Take your ax and go home. Call his board and see if it answers. 

Trouble Shooting:
----------------
If his board does answer when you call it you've obviously done something
seriously wrong here, possibly broken into the wrong house. Go back and finish
the job, but be sure to check and make sure you have the correct address.

Please contact me and let me know if this method of hacking works on other
types of bbses other than WWIV or if you have any problems with this method.
I've personally only attempted the "axe" method on WWIV and it's been 
successful every time but there's a rumor going around that perhaps this will
also work on VBBS, Wildcat and Citadel software, but some modifications may 
have to be made.

Secret WWIV Commands:
--------------------
We all know what an amazing programmer and hacker I am. While passing a rainy
day last week I was looking through the WWIV program and source code and
noticed a number of flaws and back doors throughout the program. Perhaps
Wayne Bell is trying to pull a fast one just so he can get free access anywhere
or destroy computers of sysops he doesn't like or something, I don't know, but
there was definately some really odd stuff in there. Here's a breakdown of
what I found. Keep in mind that I've called WWIV bbses around the country and
all of these "secret" commands seem to work in most every version of WWIV.

1. From the main menu if you hit [CTRL] [R] [O] [Y] and stomp on the floor six
times REAL HARD you'll get a DOS prompt. From there you can do anything you
want to the victim's hard drive.

2. From the main menu type /OCEAN for a super-secret ansi music menu. This 
does a lot of really amazing things. This is for real.

3. WWIV has a built-in virus command that can be activated by any user, even
with a SL of 10. From the main menu type "//I AM A TOTAL LOSER" with your left
hand only. If you use your right hand in any way, the virus will backfire in
a very bad way. Oh also, if your nose is pierced, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS. I won't
get into why, though.

The virus will turn the outside casing of the sysop's computer bright orange
and will kill off any smaller life forms in his house, including dogs, cats,
fish and all the house plants. It will also cause the sysop's front doorbell
to malfunction for a few weeks and cause the top left drawer in the sysop's
desk to stick alot.

4. While transferring any file, repeatedly hit [CTRL] & [C] until the transfer
aborts. A split second before it aborts, though, type "booga booga" and flip
the computer's power switch on and off quickly fifteen times. If you get a
message saying something like, "System failure" don't worry. This is only a
part of the back door. This trick allows you to read all the users' private
mail.
