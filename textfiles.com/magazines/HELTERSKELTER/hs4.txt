Editor's note: 
     Well, I've finally become confident enough in my competence
and dedication to start to offer subscriptions to this fine piece
of trash.  $5 for 6 issues is how it's looking now.  Anyway, Here's
the story of my life for the past week.  It all started about a
week ago when my politics class was assigned a 4-5 page paper on
Karl Marx due on Tues.(today).  I'm president of a school group
that raises money for a school in Haiti, and we had a show this
weekend (that my band played in) and so I was going to do that on
Sat.  Fugazi played Sun. night, and that was on my list too.  So
I don't get out all weekend except to play this show (quick
tangent:  after the show I went down to Georgetown to eat with some
friends, and when we park we find out that one of our tires is
popped, and we spend the next few hours getting it fixed by some
towing guy who was drunk and had a hell of a lisp, but I won't go
into that), and to see fugazi Sunday (which was amazing, I'll
review it in this issue).  It wasn't that bad (I could have used
a little more time than 5 days for a 4 page paper, and this was the
worst weekend it could happen in, but...), but yesterday I had 4
wisdom teeth out.   
     I go in there and I have to sign something promising that if
i died I wouldn't sue them.  (Other risks: brain damage, a hole in
my sinuses, and complete lack of feeling in my face for the rest
of my life.)  So I sign my life away and they take me to the
dentist's chair.  After rinsing my mouth out they tie up my arm,
have me clutch a towel, and shoot me up with a mixture of valium
and some other narcotics.  I remember being able to tell that they
were doing something, but closing my eyes and not being able to
close my mouth, and that everything seemed really, really funny. 
I also thought the whole thing lasted about 5 minutes (It really
lasted about half an hour.)  Long story short--> I go home with
blood gushing out of my mouth (it's still bleeding a bit as I type
(and it's a day later)), giddy as a schoolgirl from whatever they
shot into me.  Right now I'm souped up (I love that term,  souped
up) on some codeine-like painkillers, and today of all days the
computer picks to fuck up and delete my 2 pages of zine reviews
that I did. But that's ok.  I have strong fingers and a quick mind. 
By the time you read this, I'll have the reviews done and in your
hands.  What a doll I am.   
     More stuff:  If you like zines (which you probably do since
you're reading one and all) and you have a modem, call my BBS. 
It's called the Omniverse (dumb name, I may change it soon) and the
# is 301-718-0225.  It's got lots of zine info, a few editors, and
lots of stuff on the punk scene in general.  What else....Oh, yeah,
If you ever hear that The Eddie Blue Knees Band is playing, come
and watch us.  I play bass.  Introduce yourself to me.  If you get
ahold of this before January 20th, 1995, come see us play at NCS,
near the Washington Cathedral.  All proceeds from that show will
go to benefit that school in Haiti. 
     Ok, I guess I'll wrap this up and leave space for some art at
the bottom..  The address for submissions, subscriptions, trades,
stuff to be reviewed, is:

3519 Woodbine St. 
Chevy Chase, MD 20815 
E-Mail: 
derek.teslik@sbaonline.gov 
OK, here are the "policies":  I love to trade zines, it helps a lot
if you indicate "TRADE" somewhere on yours/in yours (on the address
label maybe?)  I will review anything sent my way:zines, music,
books, videos, etc., etc., etc...let me into a show for free and
I'll promise to review that too. 
Submit ANY type of writing, I'll probably print it.  I'll send you
a few copies of the issue you're printed in.  Same with art, photos
are cool, but the best thing to send is pen-drawn art. (pencil is
not as well picked up by the xerox, but it'll do....) 
Free ads, free classifieds, etc.  If you send it, I'll print it.

Hello.  First report from the other side.  I arrived here shortly
after departure, to a storm of red and blue spitting down paint. 
It is comfortable here, a bit jarring here {I believe because of
Jet lag of the type} at first, but i foresee a long and ingenuating
stay. I see a majestic courtyard of magnetic yellow and blue faded
as if it were under ice.  I am being pricked and jabbed by a
repressed memory, fearful of discovery.  Discovery's the goal,
right, so I return to the courtyard.  It is located in a faded tan
castle whose walls are covered by gripping Ivy.  At this point it
promptly disappears into a rave, with disco ball, dark otherwise. 
It appears to be in some sort of cave, filled with stalagmite
columns painted into swirls toward the ceiling by luminescent
paint.  Cut-out silhouettes of happy 50's couples together against
visual effects.  Hole in scene reveals a happy Caucasian couple on
the beach.  Neighborhood watch sign. Abraham Lincoln on the beach
with a mohawk. Clean cut Beaver cleaver type, smile as big as
Texas, on a Poster.  There's something I want to say, but I find
myself running between two close, tall curved mirrors. I fade out,
and will continue the report when the sun is up again.

Sleeping, holding midnight pattern, 
I saw the girl across the row 
Her eyes were blonde, her hair was blue 
She gently sucked upon her toe 
I floated over, misty eyed, 
Wandering wrecked upon the train 
One billion purplish bubbly fizzes 
Burnt like acid in my brain 
Then you ripped your hair away 
Your scalp now shiny dented dome 
My wrists drip blood upon your tongue 
(And smiling, asks me for a comb).

some stuff by Lester Oliver 
We've moved from The Federal Poverty Level all the way to 
"Economically Disadvantaged". Now we're headed back down. The
economy seems to be a disaster everywhere. Did you hear that
Manpower is now the largest employer in the US? Commentators talk
about how people have a "sense of foreboding", and what they can
do to get over it. Good grief. Anybody who doesn't have a sense of
foreboding is either brain dead or watches FAR too much television
(or is that the same thing?)  
A recent AP story reported that Haiti is in such terrible economic
shape because "1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth" 
Well dust ma' broom. Last I heard, here in the US, 1% of the 
population controls between 72% and 84% of the wealth. Let's face
it: Amerika is a 'third world country'. 
 
Twenty-five years ago, I expected a revolution. Now that I'm older
well, now, at any rate, I expect the bloodiest, most brutal Civil
War that the world has ever seen. "The end of history", as the
Russians call it. 
     -Look at Waco and The Branch Davidians (The Government lied)
     -Militias are forming on the left and right. 
     -Federal Detention Centers = A (clean) Auschwitz? 
 
I think that Bosnia / Hertz-a-ga-inna-gadda-davida (whatever) 
provides a glimpse of our own future. And there will be lots of 
foreign support for any war against "The Great Satan". 

Remember Bruce Coburn's song "If I Had a Rocket Launcher"? 
     "How I hate the Generals, 
     And their bloody torture state. 
     If I had a rocket launcher, 
     I would not hesitate." 
Well, some folks do have rocket launchers. Unfortunately, I'm not
one of them. 
 
People can extract ortho-phosphate nerve agents in their garage 
(handy household hint: start with Shell NO-PEST Strips, or 
Blackleaf 40). Or purify ricin. (Start with Castor Beans, extract
with isopropyl alcohol, concentrate.) 
 
SKS rifles are still available for around $75. (Please see 
enclosed) Enfields and Moison-Nagents run from $35 to $55. Gewrer
1888 Commission Mausers (8 mm) are as cheap as $25, and are
considered a 'Curio/Relic' and aren't subject to *ANY* gun control
laws!!! You just have to keep the pressures down in the loads for
the 1888's. Even so, they're accurate to around 500 yards, and
effective at 1500. 
 
"It's the time of the assassins,

Don't vote! It only encourages them!

Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys:

Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth, 
Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame, 
A mechanized automaton.

 TWINKIE FAILURE TESTING 
by Terry 
 
       In an effort to clarify questions about the purported
durability and unusual physical characteristics of Twinkies, we
subjected the Hostess snack logs to the following experiments: 
 
EXPOSURE: 
        A Twinkie was left on a window ledge for four days, during
which time an inch and a half of rain fell.  Many flies were
observed crawling across the Twinkie's surface, but contrary to
hypothesis, birds -- even pigeons -- avoided this potential source
of sustenance. 
       Despite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the
Twinkie retained its original color and form.  When removed, the
Twinkie was found to be substantially dehydrated.  Cracked open,
it was observed to have taken on the consistency of industrial foam
insulation; the filling, however, retained its advertised
"creaminess." 
 
RADIATION: 
       A Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which
was set for precisely 4 minutes -- the approximate cooking time of
bacon.  After 20 seconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's
rich, characteristic aroma of artificial butter.  After 1 minute,
this aroma began to resemble the acrid smell of burning rubber. 
The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes, 10 seconds, when thick,
foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven.  A second
Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment.  This Twinkie leaked
molten white filling.  When cooled, this now epoxy like filling
bonded the Twinkie to its plate, defying gravity; it was removed
only upon application of a butter knife. 
 
EXTREME FORCE: 
       A Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of
approximately 120 feet.  It landed right side up, then bounced onto
its back.  The expected "splatter" effect was not observed. 
Indeed, the only discernible damage to the Twinkie was a narrow
fissure on its underside.  Otherwise, the Twinkie remained
structurally intact. 
 
EXTREME COLD: 
       A Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours.
Upon removal, the Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its
physical properties had noticeably "slowed": the filling was found
to be the approximate consistency of acrylic paint, while
exhibiting the mercury like property of not adhering to practically
any surface.  It 
was noticed that the Twinkie had generously absorbed freezer odors. 

 
EXTREME HEAT: 
       A Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes.  While
the Twinkie smoked and blackened and the filling in one of its
"cream holes" boiled, the Twinkie did not catch fire.  It did,
however, produce the same "burning rubber" aroma noticed during the
irradiation experiment. 
 
IMMERSION: 
       A Twinkie was dropped into a large beaker filled with tap
water.  The Twinkie floated momentarily, began to list and sink,
and viscous yellow tendrils ran off its lower half, possibly
consisting of a water-soluble artificial coloring.  After 2 hours,
the Twinkie had bloated substantially.  Its coloring was now a very
pale tan -- in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water that
surrounded it.  The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a
gelatinous texture. After 72 hours, the Twinkie was found to have
bloated to roughly 200 percent of its original size, the water had
turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped spray of filling had leaked
from one of the "cream holes."  
       Unfortunately, efforts to remove the Twinkie for further
analysis were abandoned when, under light pressure, the Twinkie
disintegrated into an amorphous cloud of debris. A distinctly sour
odor was noted. 
 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
       The Twinkie's survival of a 120-foot drop, along with some
of the unusual phenomena associated with the "creamy filling" and
artificial coloring, should give pause to those observers who would
unequivocally categorize the Twinkie as "food."  Further clinical
inquiry is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn.

Deregulating Drug Use: an @narchist perspective 
 
         The debate about drug use in this country is usually
framed in terms of continued criminalization vs. legalization. the
positions in this debate mean continued harassment, including
arrests, imprisonment, theft of property, and possibly in the near
future, execution of drug dealers and users, vs. legal regulation
of drug use and sales, similar to that of alcohol and cigarettes,
including heavy taxation, and restraints on where, when and to whom
drugs can be sold.  Both of these positions are based on the same
assumption, government has the right to tell individuals what they
can and cannot do. While legalization would surely be preferable
to continued criminalization, there is a third alternative:
decriminalization and deregulation. 
     Decriminalization and deregulation of drugs would mean no laws
against drugs, no government regulation of drugs' sales and use,
no arrests, no prisons, no taxes. Eliminating drug laws, instead
of simply replacing them with different laws, would produce a free
market in drugs where people would be free to sell, ingest, or
inject whatever they wished, without government interference. 
         Drug use is a voluntary, non-violent activity, and should
be an individual decision, the business of no one but the user.
Government has taken it upon itself to regulate drug use, just as
it regulates alcohol use, restricts abortion, and registers and
drafts people, in order to better control them. Criminalization of
drugs has produced, just as prohibition of alcohol did, an enormous
amount of violent crime. Most of this crime is motivated by the
need to obtain money to pay the artificially inflated price of
illegal drugs. This drug-associated crime is then used as an excuse
for police to indiscriminately harass young black men, stopping and
searching, and frequently arresting them on the street, for no
reason other than that they live in a "high crime" area. Doing away
with drug laws would dramatically lower the cost of drugs and
thereby eliminate most street crime, as well as remove the excuse
police use to terrorize black people. 
         Decriminalization and deregulation and the resultant
competitive market in drugs would produce purer and safer drugs,
eliminating much of the death and illness associated with drug use,
most of which is caused by contamination of drugs or needles, and
unreliable drug strength, not by the nature of the drug itself.
Heroin is no more dangerous than aspirin if it is carefully
prepared without dangerous additives and injected with a sterile
needles. And aspirin overdose can kill as easily as heroin
overdose, it just takes longer and feels worse. Decriminalizing
needle use would virtually eliminate the transmission of AIDS among
IV drug users, as has been the experience in the 38 American states
which do not restrict sale of sterile needles. Needle exchange
programs are not enough; there need to be more needles available
to eliminate needle sharing. 
         Besides abolishing laws against recreational drugs,
eliminating government regulation of "therapeutic" drugs would also
benefit people. The FDA prevents many drugs from reaching the
market, including treatments for AIDS, cancer and other serious
illnesses. And those that do eventually become available are
delayed for years by FDA rules, while thousands die. The government
is currently responsible for restrictions on aerosolized
pentamidine, a drug which prevents Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
the most frequent cause of death in people who have AIDS. Just as
drug laws lead to deaths associated with  street drugs and keep
people from obtaining sterile needles to prevent transmission of
AIDS, drug laws are killing people with AIDS by denying them
effective treatment. Drug laws in this country are also preventing
marketing of newly developed abortifacients, drugs which induce
abortion early in pregnancy, freeing women from their current
reliance on the medical establishment for abortion services. these
drugs would put the decision about abortion where it belongs: with
the individual. 
     Eliminating drug laws would greatly increase people's options
in the areas of pleasure and health. It would also reduce crime,
reduce death and illness associated with illegal drug use, and
reduce deaths from AIDS and other serious illnesses. Individuals
should be free to make their own decisions about drug use, and all
other aspects of their lives, without the interference of
government or "the community".
