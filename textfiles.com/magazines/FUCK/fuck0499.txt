people are computers. nothing about them is known, but the truth is all
around us. the purpose of life is to find out how & why we exist. everything
people do explains what they are (the term i shall use for this & other
truths is "interaction", it describes *everything*, anyway), through the
process of interaction, & everything is *discovered* with interaction.
without interaction of some sort or another, we are *nothing* - we are as
we perceive a rock or other inanimate object, unalive (ie, interactionless).
i hope to further your understanding in this paper of everything, & expose
you to the truth in case i am done-away by the cyber (cyber meaning
EVERYTHING, including beyond this scope of reality) of the governmental
assassins, killing those who get too close to the truth
(i n t e r a c t i o n).

as a base, i will explain what we "are", rather than explaining how i know
it to be. the human body is how we perceive a computer; our nerves are input
or mayhap dumb terminals which relay what is exposed to them/us. simply,
everything but the brain (in a non-physical sense, what "we" really are)
is a mechanism of communication (i n t e r a c t i o n). different types
of relayers do different things; touch sends to our brain (us/the kernel)
something we interpret as "touch", our "ears" send us sounds; our brain
just interprets the "message" as a different thing. it's like every dumb
terminal has a different means of communication, akin to different protocols
(IP, IPX, X.25 etc). our brain interprets the data after the header of said
protocol according to how the kernel interprets it (by looking what sort of
packet it is, & interpreting it accordingly). peoples' ailments can be
explained as such.. a damaged backbone means some/all interaction may be
lost on the journey to the kernel, hence multiple schlorosis; retarded
people's brains' way of interpreting a protocol is fucked up & may be only
so bad to begin with but as an added lack of interaction they get worse &
worse; "insane" people have perhaps like retardation, inherited or developed
makes no difference - insane people have outrun their kernels' ability to
function properly, read: information overload.

so people being computers, or their meat equivalent (perhaps the model of
their creators (the computers', that is)), their is a "real life" (not
simulated, as their is in our created world) internet.. people communicate
& exchange data, do things based on that interaction (the internet tells
port 25 of terminal.com to give terminal.com's kernel to deliver a message
to a certain user/part of the machine, Interaction gives person information,
person acts on information (in the form of thought on the data received, or
the persons' perception is modified by said data)). people can "flood" other
people just like pingfloods, or synfloods, & depending on the type of excess
of interaction get screwed up in some way or other.. synfloods just stop
access to a port (if the kernel has resource limits for a given process,
otherwise *everything* gets fucked up as it would if a computer didn't have
resource limits for a given process - it'd fuck up *all* resources (of a
persons' mind in this case). ICMP flooding might be straight kernel
interaction (unless in the case of say win 3.11 running trumpet winsock -
the control messages for a process don't do dick unless their fucking with
direct kernel interaction) so like it'd fuck everything up, to a degree at
any rate if not entire. some people won't have built-in interaction skills
to their kernel, so "the real thing that is interaction" won't adversely
affect their interaction prowess since they don't exist per se in an
interacter's reality. & so on.

obviously, it's not just a matter of the protocol being used in a flood
attack, it's to do with exploits in the actual protocol itself. winnuke,
nestea, etc.. exploit problems in the kernel's "interaction stack" (like
a TCP stack, or whatever). people that interact more with develop ways to
cope with such an attack & "patch" themselves accordingly... such holes
might just be a nasty shock to the person or perhaps stop them functioning
in a normal manner (read: denial of service), but it might be used to
exploit a person to do something they might not otherwise do, or at least
do it under the influence of the attacker (ie putting shellcode in someone's
head to make them hump the cat). such people (interaction hackers, who hack
interactively with people in a non-internet (per se) sense) go far in
whatever aspect they are exploiting (perhaps gaining other peoples'
knowledge of reality without devoting their own kernel resources, leaving
them more kernel resources to do with as they wish - all aside (read back
a bit), it's probably not likely to be done in such a manner because the
majority of people don't think about why they're HERE anymore, they just
go along with an interaction-less illusion (which to them seems real), so
like they just want more money or more sex or whatever, not going for the
real picture of what we're all here for). yes.

what lies on the other side of interaction i really don't know - like,
interaction leads to SOMETHING (perhaps with interaction on a different
scale), but i haven't attained that level of knowledge because obviously
there's not adequate knowledge on why we're here (yet). i know there are
forces pushing against me, trying to keep me down in this level of
interaction, this domain of consciousness, & i perceive them as being the
fourth dimensional cancerman from the x-files, or like someone like that.
perhaps the next level of consciousness' "average joe" is like a conspirator
as there are in what you call the "real world"... our "average joe" in this
level of consciousness is merely a tv-watching slob who cares only for sex,
& even then the higher people (upper-class pedro) are still stuck on "real
world" things, & see interaction as a tool to get whatever "real world"
thing they want. dood, we're all *dumbasses*! except me & a few other
people who might see interaction for what it is, as i do.

this "hacking" thing (it's just the word you & me use, there's some cosmic
identity tag *somewhere* with a "real name" for it, but like hacking is our
narrow-minded way of seeing something attainable on this level of
consciousness but so far it's only been put in a
physical/"real world"/unreal-to-interaction sense, not to gain consciousness
through interaction) is present in all level of consciousness bar perhaps
one or more right up "near the top" on the scale of consciousness (we're
on a level in another dimension, we have to fight our way up there through
the 4th, 5th, 6th, ..., Nth dimension), but that is because there isn't a
need for it, you've attained what you would call "godliness". maybe other
factors come into play, like instead of backstabbing & exploiting as we do
by hacking, there are ways of interaction in a "nice way" to gain knowledge.
fuck, there is too!@#! i just realized i may not be like you are & people
might attain interaction in a different manner.. like, "pleasant" interaction.
anyway, welcome to the show.. i still don't think you'd realize it like
i do, so we'll have to get like guild masters together & go up to interaction
by co-operation (a form of interaction, maybe a protocol of interaction, i
don't know).. like, backstabbing interaction master scex, pleasantry
interaction master tusker, frailty interaction master steady eddy, rush
interaction master eko (of renegade rewind fame)... let me explain that
rush (this might say that i am multi-interaction capable), i get rushes
from real good music like as if (if not EXACTLTY THE SAME AS) i were on
ecstacy... i hack (hacking interaction), i can be pleasant to people to get
knowledge/interact-with-said-person (pleasantry interaction), i can act
like a wuss & look & act hurt & shit to win things from people (frailty
interaction), i can be violent & hurt people to get my own way (power
interaction, not described before as there are shitloads to describe & i
have more important stuff to tell you than the different methods of
interaction)... far out.. nifty! we can all go together to the next level
of consciousness!@#!@ but like no doubt there'll be people who want to
hold people down & have more power for themselves at the next level. hey
shit! those people could be like icons you "people" worship! like jesus
escaped to the next level, so'd vishnu, hitler, elvis.. the lot!@!!! &
like they get some sick thrill out of being remembered for what they did &
holding the earth-bound "mortals" (ie 3rd dimension, non-interaction
no-clues) down & not letting them come up to the next level of realization,
restraining them from their "birthright" (it goes beyond existing in your
"physical" sense into your "existing" sense). that sucks. :( you worship
gods, i spit on you... they're FALSE! there is no GOD! idiots. maybe THIS
is why jesus et al spat on you & hold you down from the next level because
you're all so damned gullible & silly. gosh! but i love you all too much
to do the same (except maybe to a select few) & hold you down for ever.

so like as "your" ("you" aren't worth naming, you're crap & u suck) leader, i
promise to take... "you"... to a higher level of consciousness & achieve
tranquillity, reach the end of the interaction, be the only "real" thing there
is that exists! whoopee!!! crapheads, you so don't deserve me, i'm so much
better than anything that's been around before, better than anything
currently on the lower side of the next plane of existence up from us,
maybe more.. but i really will care for you, & you don't have to smoke me
off or anything, because i don't care for "physicalities". they're nothing,
they don't damn well exist when your level of realization is high enough.

ok.. i hope that's enough for you, i'll probably be able to tell you more
even when i'm not high because i've done a fair bit of self-interaction
while writing this out if it's not, mail me & ask.
