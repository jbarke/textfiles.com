     Mr. Nat Goodwin used up all of the fifty-seven varieties of poses in
responding to curtain calls at the Lyric Sunday night, which curtain calls
were not given out of admiration for, nor even interest in "Cameo Kirby."
They were grounded upon a desire to welcome back an actor who was once an
artist...As a play it is so full of inharmonious situations, so replete with
impossibilities, so crowded with cheap conveniences, and generally so trivial
and inconsequential, that it is a wonder that one sees Booth Tarkington's
name attached to the play...Not one of the ten of twelve characters is
equipped with lines or duties which seem to flow harmoniously or consistently
out of real life, saving, perhaps, little Juliet Shelby, who plays the part
of a small child.  As children may be expected to do almost anything
unexpected or strange, her errors are easily overlooked...

     Chicago--Lou M. Houseman, western representative for A. H. Woods, and
Fred F. Fleck, manager of "The Littlest Rebel," were arraigned in Judge
Scott's court Thursday, Aug. 29, on a charge of using Mary Miles Minter in
the play in violation of the State labor laws regulating the employment of
children.  The case was continued by agreement to Sept. 3.  The State factory
department claims it has a statement from the girl's grandmother that she was
born in 1902.  The defense says the girl is seventeen years old.  She plays
the part of the Littlest Rebel.  Many of the members of the cast will be
summoned as witnesses at the next hearing of the case.

     While enacting a scene for the production of "Barbara Frietchie"
recently, at Fort Lee, Mary Miles Minter accidentally shot William Morse in
the arm.  The wound did not prove very serious, although it caused a lot of
excitement for a while.

     The Columbia-Metro aggregation of players, under Edgar Jones and with
Mary Miles Minter as the star, whose destination is St. Augustine, left New
York on a special Pullman car on Wednesday, December 8.  They will at once
begin work on two five-part features, "Dimples" and "A Scrap of Pasteboard,"
both of them original manuscripts.

     Mary Miles Minter, the popular Metro star, who will shortly be seen in
the stellar role of "Dimples," took a day off recently to buy articles and
prepare a crate in which to send a number of things to the soldiers now at
the front in Europe.  Miss Minter's private tutor, Miss Coursolies McCaul,
received word that her brother had enlisted with a Canadian regiment and
would leave for England within a few days.  Miss McCaul arranged to go to
Toronto to see her brother off.  Miss Minter readily granted her a week's
vacation.  Then Miss Minter remarked that it would not seem right to send the
young man without some sort of remembrance, although she had never seen him.
Accompanied by her mother, she went on a shopping expedition and bought
everything that a little girl thinks a soldier needs.  Among these things was
a set of poker chips and cards in a compact case.

     In future, when Mary Miles Minter goes touring on the East Side, New
York, she will carry an interpreter with her.  Thursday night Mary appeared
in Loew's Avenue B Theatre and dwelt at great length upon the subject of
motion pictures.
     Leaving the theatre she entered her flivver, which she manages herself,
and endeavored to ride through the crowd.  Suddenly an inhabitant of the
neighborhood dashed in front of the machine gesticulating wildly and mumbled
incoherently.
     Immediately Mary became frightened, and shrieked for the police and
mama.  The crowd took up the cry and soon pandemonium reigned with no one
aware what it was all about.
     A gendarme approached and grasped the culprit firmly by the collar and
was about to drag him off to the bastille when the prisoner, pointing to the
lamps on the auto, said excitedly:  "I vant to tell her der lights iss oudt!"
This caused the cop to walk out of the picture in disgust.

     Mary Miles Minter, the young star of the screen, who is now appearing in
Metro plays, has returned from a tour of several of the largest cities in
Canada, where she was tendered a truly marvelous reception.  She was received
by royalty, dined and feted by college students, visited hospitals, edited
the motion picture page of a big newspaper for one day, gave away thousands
of autographed photographs, and received so many flowers from boy and girl
admirers that it was necessary to obtain an automobile to convey them to her
hotel.
     In Montreal Miss Minter appeared at various theatres and was welcomed by
more than 25,000 persons.  She first visited the Children's Memorial Hospital
and presented each of the children with a pound box of candy.  Later in the
parlors of the Windsor Hotel she held a reception for the boys and girls of
thirteen years old, her own age.
     In the evening she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, where she was
presented with a handsome traveling bag by her boy and girl admirers.  When
she went to supper at the Windsor later in the night she found the dining
room had been converted into a veritable flower garden.
     The following day she appeared at several theatres, and in every one
scores of bouquets were thrown at her feet on the stage.  In the evening
there was a reception for Miss Minter in the private theatre of the
Starfilms, Ltd., the distributors of Metro pictures in Canadian territory.
Among those who attended the reception were Sir Rudolphe and Lady Forget and
family, Mr. and Mrs. Martin, Madame Z. Herbert, Mr. and Mrs. Donor, Arthur
Ecrement, Paul Gailbert, Dr. and Mrs. Fleury, A. N. Brodeur, Mrs. H. Lubin
and Mr. M. R. Lubin.  Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, the mother of Miss Minter,
presented her to the distinguished members of the party.
     In Ottawa Miss Minter took complete editorial charge of the motion
picture page of the Ottawa Journal and was given a large basket of flowers by
William McLoughlin, the editor.  She appeared at the Regent Theatre in the
evening.
     That night Miss Minter personally gave away 2,000 photographs of
herself.  Later in the evening she appeared at the Chateau Laurier, where she
made a little speech to 600 boys and girls.
     She was the guest of honor at the Athletic Club of Ottawa at Rockcliffe
Park, where she participated in the ice skating, ski jumping and snowshoe
sports.

of American, is responsible for the announcement...
     It is said that Miss Minter will receive a salary in excess of half a
thousand dollars per week, but President Hutchinson declined to talk figures
in this regard.  The actress will leave for the American studios at Santa
Barbara about the middle of May...

     Wednesday, May 10, "Mutual Day" at the Motion Picture Board of Trade of
America Exposition at Madison Square Garden, was the crowning event of a week
of singular achievements.
     Thousands who thronged the Garden gathered in and about the Mutual booth
during the afternoon and evening, eager to catch a glimpse, receive a
handshake or extend their congratulation to the galaxy of Mutual stars who
were in attendance.
     Mary Miles Minter, the newest of the Mutual stars, was the center of
attraction.  Hundreds of picture devotees, but few of whom had ever seen this
charming little star in person, crowded about her, showering her with
congratulations and carrying away with them autographed photographs,
thousands of which were distributed by her and other Mutual stars during the
course of the day...

new American film laboratories.  After a tour of inspection a reception will
be held in her honor.  In the evening she will be the guest of honor at a
dinner being arranged for her.  She is anxious to get to the Coast to begin
work in the first of the special features she is to appear in.  Miss Minter
and her mother will leave for the American studios at Santa Barbara Monday
night.

     Led by the Mayor and various of his official family, Santa Barbara,
Cal., residents gave a rousing reception to little Mary Miles Minter, the
American-Mutual child star, on her recent arrival at the southern California
city to begin work on her first Mutual feature release.
     Long before the arrival of the train at the station numerous of the
city's stanch residents were on hand.  Accompanied by her mother, Mrs.
Charlotte Shelby, Miss Minter appeared on the rear platform, and after a
brief address of welcome delivered by the Mayor she was escorted through the
crowd and rushed to the American-Mutual studios, where the celebration
continued.
     As a token of comradeship members of the American-Mutual playing forces
insisted that Miss Minter be delegated to open the new concrete dressing
quarters at the plant.  In the parade from the depot to the studio exactly
162 autos took part.

     Mary Miles Minter had a narrow escape from death in an automobile
accident early in December while en route in her automobile from Los Angeles
to Santa Barbara.  She sustained injuries which are keeping her on the
hospital list but she got off much more lucky than her mother and sister,
Margaret Shelby.  Mrs. Gertrude [sic] Shelby, the mother of the girls was
driving when the car skidded and turned over in the ditch.  Mrs. Shelby
sustained a broken arm, her sister was badly cut and bruised and Miss Minter
suffered severe cuts from broken glass.

     The screen ball of Kansas City, planned and managed by the Kansas City
Screen Club, proved again that the public is intensely interested in moving
pictures, and wants to get into closer touch with the industry.  It proved,
too, that it is keen on seeing screen stars, and wants to get as close to
them as possible.
     The ball had been widely exploited, chiefly through the exhibitors of
Kansas City and the neighboring towns.  The newspapers gave liberal notices
also.  The whole country knew that something big was coming off at Convention
Hall the night of March 6.  And it was big.  The floor had been cleared, and
a stage erected in the middle thereof, on which the two bands were placed,
and where a vaudeville performance was given to open the entertainment.
Following the program, the moving picture stars were introduced.  Among them
were Rose Tapley, Mary Miles Minter, Neil Craig, Vivian Rich, Richard C.
Travers, Mr. and Mrs. Bryant Washburn and Crane Wilbur.  They also took part
in the grand march, and danced with their friends, new or old...
     That the ball was a success is putting it mildly.  It was a triumphant
success.  There were 6,000 people in the balconies and galleries, looking on.
And there were probably 4,000 who occupied boxes and 2,000 spent their entire
evening on the floor...

     Mary Miles Minter, the Mutual's young star, is heartbroken over the
death of her little dog.  When, as a mite of a child, Mary made her
legitimate reputation in "The Littlest Rebel," J. D. Wooster Lambert, Jr.,
the Listerine king of St. Louis, presented this clever child actress with a
small French poodle, called Woof-Woof.  Woof-Woof traveled with its young
mistress and, it is said, understood every line and every cue in "The
Littlest Rebel."  Mary pathetically says that the little dog was put between
sheets every night and slept like a baby.
     This little poodle reigned supreme until Richard A. Rowland, president
of the Metro Pictures Corporation, presented Miss Minter, then a Metro star,
with a long-pedigreed Pomeranian.  These two little dogs, who vied with each
other in their devotion to their young mistress, were both poisoned, and all
that skill and love could do was to save only the Pomeranian.  Poor little
Woof-Woof lies buried in Santa Barbara among the roses, and this tiny grave
holds a part of the heart of Mary Miles Minter, herself the rarest rose in
all the garden.

     The Turner and Dahnken theatres, the Tivoli, in San Francisco, and the
New T. and D., in Oakland, received Mary Miles Minter, the Mutual actress, in
person, when her picture, "The Periwinkle," was shown there this week.
     Her presence in the film playhouse followed a reception she gave to the
press of San Francisco.  Some of the scenes the reporters saw taken during
the week were shown on the Tivoli and T. and D. screens.
     In the party with the little picture actress were her grandmother, Mrs.
Miles; her director, James Kirkwood; Mr. Stout, of the American studio, and
Mr. and Mrs. C. L. Langley, the managing director of the Turner and Dahnken
circuit, and his wife...
     At the showing of the picture, Miss Minter spoke a few words to the

     Mary Miles Minter sends word that it is with great regret that she is
parting with her director, James Kirkwood, with whom she has worked for the
past year.  Mary's next picture will be "Charity Castle" in which she appears
as a very little girl.  This picture will be directed by Lloyd Ingraham.

     Mary Miles Minter and her compnay, directed by Henry King, have returned
to the studio of the American Film Company at Santa Barbara, after spending
ten mighty warm days at Hunter's Point in San Francisco Bay filming scenes
for "The Mate of the Sally Ann."  The unusually hot weather made it difficult
for her to keep about all day as a barefoot girl and the burning sun beating
upon the deck all day resulted in badly blistered feed for the little screen
star.  But Miss Minter covered her feet with adhesive plaster and bandaged
them when the scenes were over and kept right on with the work.

     Liberty Bond Day in Santa Barbara will long be remembered.  Word from
the Coast states that Mary Miles Minter, accompanied by District Attorney
Thomas Lee Woolwine, who will probably be California's next Governor, were
wildly cheered as they motored to the National Bank.  Patriotic airs were
played by the band and the American Film Company placed flares along the
street.  Spotlights flashed a benediction on the young star.  As she took her
place the enthusiasm was so great that for a time her voice could not be
heard, a riot seemed imminent...Local papers state that but for the tireless
efforts of Mary Miles Minter the maximum quota could not have been secured.
As it is, Santa Barbara County totaled a million more than the amount
necessary.  On Saturday night alone, nearly $100,000 in bonds passed through
the hands of Mary Miles Minter.  All hail to her!

     Los Angeles--The Club of Forty gave its first dinner dance on Halloween
and it was unusually successful. Speaking from a cinema standpoint there
perhaps has never been an affair which attracted so many distinguished guests
and one from which the general public was so carefully and diplomatically
eliminated.
     Mary Pickford was the guest of honor, and Mary Miles Minter ran her a
very close second. They both made speeches. George Beban and District
Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine also addressed the gathering, but both very
briefly and to the point. The boys and girls were they for a good time and
they certainly had it.
     Olive Thomas, Mae Murray, Dorothy Dalton, Gail Kane, Adele Rowland,
Vivian Martin, Lottie Pickford and so many other beauties were present, and
the boys were so dazzled they had to wear tortoise shell cheaters the next
day.
     Among the especially invited guests were District Attorney Thomas Lee
Woolwine, Alfred A. Cohn, Harry Caulfield, Mrs. Shelby, mother of Mary Miles
Minter and Mrs. Pickford...

Minter made a street campaign in that burg which awakened even the oldest Rip

     Mary Miles Minter, who has been working daily since the opening of the
Fourth Liberty Loan drive in the interests of piling up bond sales, will
cease her bond selling activities for two hours tomorrow afternoon in order
to devote her time to meeting the patrons of the Kinema Red Cross tea room,

her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, and her sister, Miss Margaret Shelby.
     Miss Minter, upon finishing her latest feature picture at the American
Film studios at Santa Barbara, came down to Los Angeles in time to go out to
Long Beach and take care of the bond sales in that city.  She piled up a
total of $361,800 worth of bond sales in four hours on Saturday afternoon and
in the evening added $155,000 worth of sales to this total.  Daily since then
she has visited the small towns around Los Angeles to aid the Liberty Loan.
     On Thursday afternoon from 3 to 5, however, she will sip tea and meet
all patrons of the tea room at the Kinema theater.  Miss Minter was secured
to aid the Red Cross through the courtesy of the Mabel Condon exchange.

     On March 27, 1918, Mary Miles Minter, American-Pathe star, christened
the big hydroplane, F-1, which was built in Santa Barbara by Allen and
Malcolm Loughead, and at the time Miss Minter predicted that the huge man-
made bird would some day make Santa Barbara proud of it.  It would now seem
that her prediction is in a fair way to be realized, as F-1, remodeled as a
land plane, left Santa Barbara November 23 for a cross-continent trip to
Washington, D. C.
     Miss Minter and her party gave the F-1A and its crew a royal sendoff and
shortly before the official flight was started Miss Minter was a passenger in
a trial flight over the city of Santa Barbara.  The star was also a passenger
on the maiden voyage of hydroplane F-1 over Santa Barbara Channel.
     Pilot Meyenhoffer carried a letter to President Wilson written by Miss
Minter, which read as follows:
     "To the Honorable Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, The
White House, Washington, D. C.
     "Our Most Honored President:
     "I send you greetings from California and take this opportunity to
express the appreciation I feel, as a citizen of our wonderful republic, to
you, our great and just statesman, who has brought our nation safely through
this crisis.
     "I am not old enough to cast my vote for you, but may I assure you of my
loyalty and express the hope that together with my countrymen, I may salute
you as our President for another term of years.
     "Faithfully yours,
          "Mary Miles Minter."

     Ever so often in every motion picture star's life comes up the question
of whether to renew the present contract or whether it be better to start
something new.  This, with apologies to William Shakespeare, is what is
happening now in the life of Mary Miles Minter.
     Miss Mary Miles Minter's contract with the American Film Company expires
in May, and just now there is speculation on what Miss Minter intends to do
when this said contract expires.
     Some time ago considerable interest was aroused in the motion picture
world by a story stating that D. W. Griffith had made an offer to Samuel S.
Hutchinson of the American Film Company to release Miss Minter from her
present contract with the American.  Naturally, Mr. Hutchinson declined to
grant this request, and later also refused to loan Miss Minter for one
picture.
     This, of course, may all be gossip, though it was accepted as the truth
when the report came out.  If it is true, it may be that Mr. Griffith only
wanted Miss Minter for one picture.  It has not been the Griffith way to take
screen stars trained by any one else for his pictures.  He has, with the
possible exception of George Fawcett and other stage stars, starred only
those screen players who have been trained by himself.
     Miss Minter has been with the American Film Company for several years
and has fared very well at their hands.

     Mary Miles Minter continues to play in New York--that is the word play
being meant in the relative sense of the term.  A rumor being current that
she was about to sign with Famous Players, this department sent an inquiry
back to the blonde star.
     Said Miss Margaret Shelby, sister of Miss Minter, who, together with
their mother, accompanied the star to New York, to the Times representative
when he called:
     "My sister has not yet signed a contract, although she is considering
several very fine offers.  The prices offered for her services would surprise
you if I told you some of the amounts.  However, the situation with Juliette
(that being the actress's real name) is this:
     "Juliette told me today that she is thinking seriously of letting a
couple of months pass by before affixing her name to any sort of a contract.
She needs a rest, you see, and it has been agreed among ourselves that New
York City will make the best summer resort that we can think of.  We have our
pets here and in our new Fifth Avenue home.  We have become so delighted with
New York and our home that we will stay here for some time to come.  Sister
has had very little time to rest, having been busy with her long string of
engagements.  When she started out to perform in pictures a few years ago
with the Frohman Amusement Company, we really never thought the time would
arrive when she would have to relax a bit."

     Mary Miles Minter has signed for three and a half years to star in
Realart Pictures.
     She is the first of the artists to be announced by Realart.  It is said
that the opportunity to engage Miss Minter was one of the reasons for the
formation of Realart Pictures Corporation, of which Arthur S. Kane is
president.
     Immediately after completing late Tuesday afternoon the agreement which
has been under negotiation for some weeks Miss Minter left with her mother,
Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, for Atlantic City for her first vacation in years.
She is scheduled to begin work Monday, June 30, in New York City on her first
photo-play under the new contract.
     All of the pictures are to be made by the Mary Miles Minter Productions
Company.  They will be produced at the rate of six attractions yearly, or a
total of twenty productions for the period of the contract.  It is stated
these are to be made solely from novels and stage successes...
     The actual signing of Miss Minter's contract was done by her mother,
Mrs. Shelby.  This was necessary because the youthful star is still several
years under age...
     Under her new engagement Miss Minter will work in New York City for the
first time in four years.  She has transferred her residence here from Santa
Barbara, Cal., where she has lived and made her productions in the past.

     The little girl with the biggest motion-picture contract in the
world--that's Mary Miles Minter.  But she pays a stern price for it, inasmuch
as her personal life is ordered by the rules laid down in the contract, and
she is even forbidden to wed during the life of the agreement.
     We're always getting a record of the "biggest contract ever signed in
motion pictures," and here is Miss Minter's:
     By its terms she will receive in three years the sum of $1,300,000.  She
is to get $250,000 for her first five pictures, or $50,000 a picture.  For
the second five she will get $300,000, or $60,000 a picture, and for the
third five $350,000 or $70,000, and for the forth five, $400,000, or $80,000
a picture.  No chances were taken with Miss Minter because she happens to be
a minor.  While she was represented by O'Brien, Malevinsky and Driscoll, the
contract was so drawn that her every act will come under the supervision of
her employer, Mr. Zukor.
     A sensational feature provides that, though Miss Minter is but 16 years
old, and therefore might be expected to love social gaiety, she is to order
her life according to a set of rules which provide she shall live the
quietest kind of home life, never be seen in public when it is possible to
avoid it, and never associate in public with stage or screen folk.  Also--and
this might not be pleasing to a lot of screen stars--she is to receive no
interviewers.
     All these terms are new in the screen world, but were adopted years ago
in case of some stage stars by Charles Frohman and David Belasco.  Maude
Adams, as is known, never has been interviewed.  On the other hand,
tremendous advertising is to be done in Miss Minter's behalf by Mr. Zukor.
     When Miss Minter went to New York she had no idea she should be able to
make such wonderful terms.  Selznick made her a very good offer, but Adolph
Zukor raised it, then Selznick is reported to have "seen" the offer, but
Zukor again outbid him.  Then Mrs. Shelby, Mary's mother, suddenly realized
what a bonanza her daughter really was, and just let the two men bid against
each other as long as they would, under advice of her attorney.
     Miss Minter's pictures are to be released and sold under the Realart
trademark, and the star will commence work June 30.  Her company will be
known as the Mary Miles Minter productions.
     The little actress and her mother are now vacationing in Atlantic City,
where Miss Minter is enjoying to the full the only free social life she is to
be allowed to know during the next three years.

     Mary Miles Minter was hostess to a party of distinguished guests at her
home on Fifth Avenue, New York, Wednesday night, when she entertained the
heads of the Belgian Military Mission to the United States at dinner.
     The guests included General Leon Ossterieth, head of the Belgian
Military Mission, who has been decorated by King Albert 17 times for valor in
battle.  The general is here preparing for the coming of King Albert to
America in the Fall.  He is a Knight of the Order of Leopold II and a Knight
of the Crown, the two highest honors a Belgian can win.  Lieut. William Van
Goethern, of the Belgian Army, who has also been decorated, was also in the
party...The third member of the party was William Augustus Whiteley, American
attache to the Belgian mission.
     After dinner the entire party attended the performance of the "Midnight
Whirl" at the Century Grove, where the officers and their navy decorations
and the beauty of Miss Minter attracted unusual attention.

     Although Mary Miles Minter has been very active at her New York studios
since July 14 preparing for her Realart debut in "Anne of Green Gables,"
actual work on the production did not begin until last Monday.  The two weeks
intervening were spent in selecting a cast of supporting players and this was
no easy task, as anyone knows who has read the "Anne" stories from which the
scenario was made.
     In starting production on Miss Minter's first Realart picture, her
director, William Desmond Taylor, introduced an unusual innovation in photo-
play technique. For the first three days not a scene was recorded by the
camera. The reason for this was that Mr. Taylor broke away from the
conventional method of direction by devoting all this time to rehearsing the
star and members of the cast.
     He believes that in this way the actors will gain a much more thorough
understanding of their roles than would be possible under the accepted system
of production and will consequently be able to play the parts much better.
     Miss Minter and her company were slated to leave for Dedham, Mass., the
latter part of last week. In the quaint old New England town, where the
exteriors for "Anne of Green Gables" will be filmed, the "location scout" of
Miss Minter's producing unit found a house that might have been patterned
after the one described in the "Anne" stories.
     It is doubtful if a more suitable spot in the whole of New England could
have been found than this as the locale of the stories.

     Dedham, Mass., will be the Mecca of New England exhibitors today.  From
a distance of fifty miles or more around Boston, they will assemble at Dedham
for a big picnic, the feature of which will include the filming of several
scenes for a photoplay, luncheon, games and the meeting of Mary Miles Minter.
     Miss Minter, assisted by her company, is to be the hostess of the
occasion and the exhibitors will be present in response to invitations
personally sent out by the Realart Pictures star.  Miss Minter has been in
Dedham for about three weeks making scenes for "Anne of Green Gables," under
the direction of William Desmond Taylor.
     Work on the exteriors for the production will be completed at the picnic
and it is stated that some of the best scenes have been reserved for the
occasion.
     The picnic is the result of visits which exhibitors have made within the
past two weeks to the location where Miss Minter is working.  Practically all
of the exhibitors who have been in Boston on business recently have made the
six-mile trip to Dedham, and, in addition, a large number of Boston
exhibitors have been guests of the Minter company.  The interest thus
manifested suggested to Miss Minter the desirability of giving the picnic.
     The star, also in response to invitations from leading theatre managers,
has visited Boston theatres.  Thursday night she made seven personal
appearances.  Four downtown photoplay houses and three in the Back Bay were
included.  In each case the star made a short address.
     It is expected that Miss Minter will resume studio work in New York
early next week...

     Arriving in town yesterday, via the Salt Lake, was Mary Miles Minter,
the new bright particular star of Realart.  Miss Minter was accompanied by
her mother, Mrs. Shelby; by her director, William D. Taylor, and by her
secretary, Mrs. Whitney.  The star and her mother went at once to the
Alexandria, where they will stay until they find a suitable millionaire's
home to rent; that is, the home must be suitable.
     Miss Minter had intended visiting Santa Barbara, her old home, but now
she isn't going to, because her two much beloved dogs, which she left when
she went to New York, have died.
     The star will soon start work at the Morosco studio, under direction of
Mr. Taylor, on Grace Miller White's story, "Judy of Rogues' Harbor."
     Miss Minter declares she's very fond of New York, and that she expects
to return there next spring.  Also she says there's no truth in the report
that her contract won't let her marry--so there!
     "But as I'm only 17 1/2, even if you don't believe me when I tell you
that," she laughed, "you'll have to speak to mother about my marrying!"
     "And it isn't true," she said, "that my contract won't let me appear on
the street with a man.  In fact, if you had been in New York, you might have
seen me many times on Broadway with some one of the nice men of my
acquaintance."
     A dinner was tendered Miss Minter last night at the Alexandria, presided
over by Oren F. Woody and Henry L. Massie, members of the Realart
organization, at which a number of the newspaper folk of the city were
guests.  Miss Minter made a very clever little speech, in which she paid a
very high compliment to Mary Pickford, whom she stated, was her ideal of all
the stars in the picture world.

     Mary Miles Minter, the Realart Pictures Corporation star, under the
direction of William Desmond Taylor, took a day off away from the studio on
Monday [November 14] to make the aquatic scenes for "Judy of Rogue's Harbor."
Silver Lake was the ideal locale for the many scenes.
     Little Mary nearly forgot for once that she was a worker, she says.  She
gave dear old Herbert Standing a thrill by rowing him around the lake and
nearly spilling him once or twice, and later she and her story sister,
Fritzie Ridgeway, climbed up in a tree to eat their lunch.

     Fred and Roy Miller, pioneers among western motion picture exhibitors,
have long been believers in the motto, "Charity and Success Go Together."
Therefore when they decided to reopen their former theater at Main-Spring-
Ninth and set the date for Saturday last [December 6], it was not surprising
to those who know their charitable inclinations that the first performance
was given over to the orphans of the city--those parentless kiddies who
depend not largely but solely upon the kindness of other for their childish
amusements.
     The theater management also saw to it that charming little Mary Miles
Minter (who might be taken for an orphan herself if her proud mother did not
dress her up in nice clothes and motion picture magnates did not insist upon
paying her a yearly salary equal to that of the king of England) was on hand
to say a few cheery words and give the children a chance to view the living
"Anne of Green Gables."  It was thoughtful of Mr. Miller and the youngsters
showed their appreciation by applauding loudly and lustily, to say nothing of
their gasps of astonishment when the real Mary walked before them right after
they had watched the reel Mary in L. M. Montgomery's charmingly delightful
story picturized by Frances Marion.

and in addition to disposing of many dollars' worth of stamps she sold a doll
six times and still retained it.

     Mary Miles Minter, the Realart star, has been rewarded for her hard work
during the weeks she has been back at the West Coast studios by official
presentation to Governor Stephens of California before a notable gathering of
7,000 people, including exhibitors, stars, directors and others prominent in
the motion picture industry.
     The largest ball held in recent days in Los Angeles was opened by the
formal introduction of Miss Minter to Governor Stephens.  According to the
original plan, Miss Minter was to have opened the ball by dancing with the
California executive, but at the last moment it developed that he did not
dance.
     However, the motion picture actress carried off the introductory honors
with rare charm, and proved quite equal to the occasion.  Miss Minter's box
was directly adjoining Governor Stephens's.  With the star were her mother,
Mrs. Charlotte Shelby; Oren F. Woody, Los Angeles manager for Realart
Pictures Corporation, and a party of friends...

house in town--that goes without saying; they never would let her go without

motoring about the country, part of the time driving the car herself, as she
said she wanted to "commune with nature," and didn't want to be bothered
talking to people.

     In recognition of the prominent place which the motion picture industry
has won in the estimation of California business men, Mary Miles Minter was
chosen as the guest of honor at a luncheon at the Alexandria Hotel, given
recently by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles
     More than 300 of the prominent business men of the city attended the
luncheon, which was the occasion for boosting "A Greater Los Angeles in
1920."  Among the prominent speakers were Dr. J. A. B. Scherer, president of
Troop College, Pasadena; John P. Carter, Internal Revenue Collector; John F.
Murray, United States Investigator in Europe of child conservation, and
Motley H. Flint, vice president of the Los Angeles Trust and Savings Bank.
     Miss Minter was not only the guest of honor but the sole representative
on the program of the motion picture industry...On the program Miss Minter
was listed as "the fastest ascending luminary of the film firmament of this
era.  Her Realart contract calls for $1,200,000 for twenty pictures.  This
prepossessing little star is a wonderful speaker.  We remember her effective
work in Liberty Loan campaigns."
     Miss Minter's speech dwelt upon the great progress made in recent years
in Los Angeles business affairs, but called attention to the still pressing
need for more and larger buildings and housing conveniences.  She praised the
various department stores and business houses and congratulated Los Angeles
business men on furnishing the motion picture industry with facilities for
buying commodities and clothing equal to New York City.
     In the same week, Miss Minter motored from Los Angeles to San Diego to
make personal appearance at the Plaza Theatre, where "Anne of Green Gables"
was having a week's run.  W. W. Whitson, proprietor of the theatre, made the
arrangements for the visit.  Miss Minter made the trip accompanied by her
mother and sister.  The party was entertained that afternoon aboard the U. S.
S. Ingraham, a destroyer.
     At the theatre one of the boxes was decorated for Miss Minter and her
party, a large electrical star being placed over it.  Miss Minter related in
her speech a number of the amusing or difficult situations that arose during
the making of "Anne of Green Gables" last summer at Dedham, Mass.

     Tripping up to the hospital and to the bedside of David Warfield
yesterday, bearing an armful of flowers, was no less a person than Mary Miles
Minter, who is an old friend of Mr. Warfield.  The flowers were half the gift
of Miss Minter and half that of Marcus Loew who as soon as he heard of
Warfield's accident, telegraphed Miss Minter to purchase flowers and send the
bill to him.  Miss Minter did so, and sent half the bill, or maybe no bill at
all, but the card on the big nosegay bore both names.
     Miss Minter promised to "come again," and when she does she's going to
take the great actor a box of fudge made by her own fair hands.

who has engaged a special nurse for small Juliet so that Mrs. Whitney may
give her usual skillful attention to the Minter publicity, answering of fan
letters, and mailing of pictures.  Grandmother Miles and Margaret Shelby are
still in New York, but Mrs. Shelby, Mary Miles Minter and Mrs. Whitney keep
house here.  Mrs. Whitney and the infant are making week-end trips frequently
to see the other half of the family.

     Having a birthday and not caring who knows it is what Mary Miles Minter
is doing today.  Also, by an odd coincidence, it is also her small cousin's,
Joseph Jordan's birthday.
     The joint birthday is to be celebrated by giving an Easter egg hunt for
young Joseph in the gardens of the beautiful Mathewson estate, where Mary
dwells.  Wallace Reid, Jr., will be one of the guests.

     Mary Miles Minter's eight-cylinder roadster was overhauled, rebuilt and
specially painted while the star was on a recent location trip.  It is now a

     Last week easily could have been designated as Motion Picture Week at
the Don Lee Coach and Body works.  Not only was Roscoe Arbuckle's $25,000 car
completed after many months of work, but special custom-built bodies on
Cadillac chassis were delivered to Jack Pickford, Lottie Pickford, Mary Miles
Minter, Betty Compton and Milton Sills.
     Jack Pickford purchased one of the exclusive town cars, of which only
one model is in Southern California.  This car was presented to his wife,
Olive Thomas, on her return from New York.
     Mary Miles Minter took deliver of the first of the season's club
roadsters turned out by the local plant and is driving the car herself...

     Charlie Chaplin and Mary Miles Minter met the other day outside the
latter's studio.  They hadn't seen each other in a long time, although they
are old friends.
     Engrossed in conversation they failed to see a crowd assembling until
they looked up and discovered scores of peering eyes, motor vehicles blocking
traffic, and a huge rubber neck motorbus load listening to a discourse
through a megaphone on their greatness.
     The comedian turned and fled...

                         Film Love Ends in Prison Term
                                       
     Visions of work by the side of a beautiful motion picture actress
brought him to Los Angeles.  Too much imagination, fired by stories he had
seen in the films of "reds" and "revolution" landed him in jail.
     Mike Serjack, 18 years old, saw Mary Miles Minter in every film in which
she starred at the "picture show" in his native Ohio village.
     He longed for the chance to see his pictured inamorata in the flesh, to
talk to her.  Surely, he though, she would understand.  Perhaps, if he told
her she would give him a job, just any little job working with her in the
films.
     The "picture show" proprietor told him that most motion picture stars
lived in Los Angels, and Mike saved his pennies to come out to the Coast.  In
July he found he had enough.
     "In order to get into the films you must do somethin' unusual to git
their attention," some one who pretended to know told him before he reached
Los Angeles.
     What would be "unusual?"  What would make the fair Mary Miles Minter
smile upon him?
     Mike pondered.  He formed a plan.  Painfully, and with much biting of
his pencil, he managed to compose the following note which he put in the mail
box the day after he arrived in the city:
     "Dear Miss Minter:  Your home is attempted to be robbed or destroyed by
red radicals.  I overheard their plans.  The reds will attempt bombing or
kidnapping.  I can prevent it if you come to the Santa Fe depot tomorrow and
tell me where you live so I can guard you.  Please come with your mother for
your sake."
     With his letter Mike enclosed a crudely printed note which was supposed
to have been stolen, at great risk to his life, from one of the "reds,"
explaining, in much veiled language, their plot against Mary.
     No one came to the Santa Fe station.  But Mike meanwhile had found out
where his heroine lived, 56 Fremont Place.  Friday morning he knocked out a
couple of teeth, otherwise made himself look like the veteran of a hard
fight, and threw himself, feigning unconsciousness, in the bushes near the
Minter home.  To save her life he had given battle to the "reds," you see.
     But instead of the fair Mary a newspaper delivery boy found Mike.  He
called a police ambulance.  Mike was taken to the police station where
Detective Sergeants Finlison, Slaughter and Hurt arrested him on complaint
filed several days previous by no less a person than Mary Miles Minter.
     Yesterday Judge Richardson, anxious to make an example to "filmstruck
youth," sentenced Mike to six months in the city jail.
     But even as he was being led to his cell it is doubtful if Mike realized
why.  All he knew was that he had done the unusual, but it had not been
appreciated.  Would the world--and Mary--never understand?

     On the probable cancellation of $1,000,000 worth of life insurance hangs
the decision as to whether or not Mary Miles Minter will continue with her
plans to become an airplane pilot.  Two companies with Minter policies of
$500,000 each threaten to declare them "scraps of paper" should the film
favorite "take the air."

     Ten thousand dollars was raised for the Disabled Soldiers of the Great
War at a ball given in September at the Alexandria in Los Angeles by the
Motion Picture Directors' Association. The affair was exceedingly gorgeous in
the appointment and entertainment and the 700 people who gathered represented
the elite of Los Angeles society as well as of the Hollywood film colony.
William D. Taylor, feature director for Realart, was in charge of the
entertainment, and presented some unique stunts. Doraldina did her
fascinating hula-hula; Tom Mix and twenty of his cowboys in full regalia
pulled a fake hold-up and separated the crowd from its spare cash; Larry
Semon paid $500 for a bat and ball autographed by Babe Ruth, and Ben Hampton
gave a like amount for a pair of crutches belonging to one of the wounded
heroes present--and then returned the crutches. Over in one corner was a
booth marked "For Men Only" at a dollar a man, which caused a good deal of
excitement, but rumor hath it that it was a blank.
     Among those who graced the dance and the wonderful supper served at
midnight were Wanda Hawley, Jeanie MacPherson, Ruth Roland, Lois Wilson, Mr.
and Mrs. Conrad Nagel, Mary Miles Minter, who entertained a party of twelve,
Tony Moreno with a number of society people from Beverly Hills, Pauline
Frederick and her mother, Bebe Daniels, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Forman, Elliott

     If there's one thing which may be considered irresistible to the
feminine heart, it's a uniform.  And now Mary Miles Minter is proving that
even so cool a little head as hers isn't proof against its lure.
     Miss Minter gave a perfectly lovely party Wednesday for officers of the
New York.  She was assisted in entertaining by Miss Lois Wilson.  There was a
horseback riding party in the morning, at Beverly Hills, then a luncheon,
followed by a bathing party at the beach, and dinner and dancing in the
evening at a local cafe.
     One mishap marred the day's joy.  That was when Gaston Glass, the young
actor, who is to portray the lead in Miss Minter's next picture, slightly
injured his side in performing a diving feat during the bathing festivities.
     Mr. Glass was thereafter unable to drive his car, but as Miss Wilson
drove it for him, it is likely that his sufferings were considerably
lightened.
     Other members of the party were Capt. Blaydon, Dana Todd and Jack
Donovan...

trip.
     According to present plans the Realart luminary will finish her current
picture, "Her Winning Way," and leave Los Angeles in time to board the
"Imperator" sailing from New York June 2.
     The first stop will be London.  Paris and Ostend will be visited by
airplane followed by a flying trip over the battlefields to Lake Lucerne,
Switzerland.  Venice, Naples, Florence, Rome and the Riviera are in the
itinerary, not to forget a motor tour up through the Chateau country of
France and short dip into Spain.
     Accompanying Miss Minter will be her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby and
her sister, Margaret, who will combine business with pleasure by gathering
ideas for the home-building firm which she owns and manages.

     Mary Miles Minter is going abroad, and like any girl of her age, she is
properly thrilled.  At a luncheon at the Hotel Biltmore she entertained about
twenty representatives from the newspapers and motion picture periodicals who
assembled to wish her "bon voyage."
     The plans for her trip have been made as carefully as those of a
visiting diplomat, for she will be a messenger representing the city of Los
Angeles bearing greetings from the Mayor of that city to many important
personages abroad, including the Lord Mayor of London, the Permier of France
and King Albert of the Belgians.  Besides these her visiting list shows such
names as Jenny, Poiret and Paquin, also Coty, Houbigant and Gelle Freres.
     The after-luncheon speeches were a bit like the old game of "Up
Jenkins." First S. Jay Kaufman called upon Mary for a speech, but she, in a
few firm and gracious words, declined, passing the honor back to him.  S. J.
called upon Mr. Dannenburg, and Joseph Dannenburg on James, who was once
press representative for Miss Minter, and from him it jumped to Bide Dudley,
the well known columnist of the World.  Mr. Dudley told a story about the
last speech he had heard Mary Miles Minter make.
     "It was at Palisades Park one day," he said.  "I was tossing rings at a
booth when I heard a childish voice behind me say, 'Dimme dat Teddy bear,'
and there was Mary.
     The sailing date is set for the Fourth, on the Olympic.  Miss Minter
will be accompanied by her mother and sister.  She expects to be gone about
four months.

     Formal and emphatic denial that Mary Miles Minter, local moving picture
star, now on tour in Europe, is to marry Orville Erringer of Portland, Ore.,
was made today by Mrs. Julia B. Miles, 701 South New Hampshire street, Miss
Minter's grandmother.
     "You may state that reports to the effect Miss Minter is to marry
Mr. Erringer or anyone else, for that matter, are absolutely false," said
Mrs. Miles today.
     "Mr. Erringer was brought to our home some time ago and there met Mary.
Their acquaintance was very slight; certainly not enough to base an
engagement rumor on.  Mary is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on or about
Aug. 23 and will at once start on a picture for the Realart people.
I receive letters from her constantly and in none of them has she even
mentioned matrimony."
     The report of the engagement is said to have emanated from the home of
Erringer's parents in Paris, Ky.  Erringer is 21 years of age and
northwestern manager of a California fruit packing corporation.

     In the absence of Mary Miles Minter and mother in Europe it was left for
Grandma Shelby to deny the story sent out from Paris, Ky., that the star is
to marry Orville Erringer of Portland, Ore.
     'Tis a far cry from Paris to Portland, but it was explained that the
"news" came to Kentucky in a letter.  Young Erringer is grandson of a former
Parisian (the glue grass kind) who was manager of the local branch of the
Western Union Telegraph Company.  So Paris got it first.
     Other details of happy fiance: Age 21; is Portland manager for a
California fruit packing concern; son of a traveling representative of a
motor car company; met Mary in Hollywood.
     Grandma Shelby says it is only a "schoolgirl romance," and that "Mary
soon recovers from them."

saving considerable money, will avoid being arrested twice in the same day,

Jesse at Wilshire boulevard and Wilton place and the second time by
Motorcycle Office Bandle at Fourteenth and Main streets.  She was charged
with speeding and operating a car without a license in each case and
deposited bail to the amount of $40.

battling.

     Los Angeles--The writers staged their first annual cramp, a
jolificiation, not a cause for a doctor--last Thursday evening at the Hotel
Ambassador. Film historians take note! For it was a party to be recorded as
perhaps the greatest single social gathering of literary and professional
celebrities sever staged. They've had them all in a theatre at one time, but
probably never at one dinner before. That old phrase, "The guest list reads
like the 'Who's Who in Literature and Filmland'," has been abused until
applied to this affair.
     And just for good measure, as well as to prove their magnetism, no
doubt, the writers added the blue book of Los Angeles society to their
roster, and they were all there in full force, marcel waves, low cut gowns
and dress suits.
     The writers' cramp was really the "coming out" party of the Screen
Writers' Guild organized here as a branch of the Authors' League of America
some sixteen months ago, the proceeds of the lavish dinner dance and original
entertainment to be used to equip the writers' new club house on sunset
boulevard.
     The first cramp was staged with a decidedly novel entertainment
"scenario," its biggest "situations" being a satirical act from the
uncensored pen of Thompson Buchanan, titled, "Lo, the Poor Writer, or
Father's Sin," a four-round boxing bout between Bert Lynch and Eddie Coffey,
featherweights, and a battle royal of five fighters representing the pioneer
scenario writers, the fight to determine who wrote the first motion picture
scenario. The lone woman won the fray, her only identification on the program
being a few question marks followed by this note: "Hush! Courtesy prohibits
using the name of a lady associated with so remote a date of ancient
history."
     The Rev. Neal Dodd was toastmaster, though his speech and those of Frank
E. Woods, Thompson Buchanan, George Foster Platt, master of ceremonies;
George Ade and others were "cut" because they could not be heard above the
clatter and chatter of the diners.
     "Father's Sin" held the limelight. It was an uncensored travesty on film
making, interpreted by Tully Marshall as the director, Theodore Roberts,
assistant director; Noah Beery, cameraman, Mary Miles Minter, assistant
cameraman; William H. Crane, "props"' Sylvia Breamer, vampire; Enid Bennett,
leading lady; Bert Lytell, leading man; Herbert Rawlinson, villain; Lionel
Belmore as the owner of the company, whose name, Mr. O'Flaherty, didn't match
his accent a-tall; Mayme Kelso as an "extra," and Roy Atwell as the abused
author...

                      Mary Miles Minter Denies Engagement
                                       
     Denial that she was engaged to marry T. P. Dixon of New York was made
this week by Mary Miles Minter, star in Paramount pictures, in a telegram to
her mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby.
     Miss Minter's telegram follows: "As there are the holidays an open
season for all sorts of wedding and engagement rumors, let's be cheerful and
round out the year with last denial.  That's seven for 1921.  Say for me I am
not engaged, married, or out of a job."
     "Although I knew it to be a waste of time," said Mrs. Shelby, "I wired
Mary about this latest rumor.  The last previous rumor had Mary engaged to
Orville Erringer of Chicago, and was circulated while we were in Europe.  The
story was given wide publicity, while later denials were not so prominently
displayed.  Mary has hosts of friends, but has not at any time considered any
one of them as a possible husband."
     Mrs. Shelby has left for Hollywood to join her daughter, who is now
engaged in producing "The Heart Specialist" in the Lasky studio.

     "Oh, but did you hear about Bebe Daniels' back-fire at Mary Miles
Minter!  It seems that Mary had very deeply offended Bebe by saying something
awfully catty to her at a party one night right before everybody.  Well, Bebe
is the sweetest girl in the world, and beloved by everybody, but she won't
stand everything.
     "It all happened out at Lottie Pickford's wedding, while the audience
was gossiping the way a crowd always does while they're waiting for the holy
bans of matrimony to be pronounced, and before the bride and groom come
gliding down the aisle.  Mary Minter was calling across to Mary Pickford,
'You know, on my second trip to Europe--' and then went on, sort of showing
off.  It all began to get on Bebe's nerves.  She called across to Lila Lee--
'Oh, dearie, do you remember our seventh trip to Europe?'  'Oh, no,' Lila
played right up, 'it wasn't our seventh trip; it was our ninth trip!'  The
crowd around was listening by this time, and Mary Minter had begun to blush,
realizing that she was being kidded.

     The two film actresses mentioned so often in connection with the Taylor
murder will each go abroad but in different directions.  Mabel Normand has
announced her intention of soon going to Europe for a prolonged stay.  Mary
Miles Minter has already left for the Orient.  A very few months ago, Mary's
engagement was announced to T. E. Dixon, you remember.  He is the son of the
millionaire pencil manufacturer.  However, since the Taylor affair entangled
Mary and disclosed a very frank and schoolgirly letter she had once written
to him--which any of us might have done in our young teen days!--Dixon is no
longer seen calling at Mary's home.  It is said that he broke the engagement
and that Mrs. Shelby, Mary's mother, is prostrated with grief...

     After having survived six weeks of strenous location activities for "The
Cowboy and the Lady," Mary Miles Minter was knocked about her private car
when a switch engine jolted it near Victor, Idaho, sustaining severe cuts and
numerous scratches and bruises.
     Tom Moore, Mary's leading man, received severe bruises about the head.
The actors were waiting to start their railroad journey back to Los Angeles
when the accident occurred.
     The unfeeling director was doubtless relieved that the actors had
completed their roles in the picture before the smash happened.

     Hollywood, Oct. 9--For the second time the capitol of filmland has hit
the gong for the benefit of the Actors' Fund of America, that splendid,
professional cause which Daniel Frohman so ably and tirelessly heads.
     Last year the motion picture branch of the fund was established by the
proceeds from an all-day carnival and gorgeous pageant given by the film folk
at the Los Angeles Speedway.  This year it was augmented by a large share of
the gross receipts from a spectacularly beautiful performance of
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  This was staged Saturday night in
the Hollywood Bowl, under the auspices of the Motion Picture Directors'
Association.
     And when standing at the side, gazing over the sea of more than 10,000
faces that lined the graceful hills of the Bowl and glancing over the
hundreds of celebrated names on the program, one reflected that nowhere else
in the world, perhaps, could there be assembled such a wealth of beauty,
luxury and talent.  About 90 per cent of the "Who's Who in Filmdom" were on
the program, playing important roles, "suping" with spears, strolling past in
the pageant, or out in the audience and driveways selling programs and acting
as ushers.  The other 10 per cent, were in the boxes for which they paid as
high as $200, or in the $10 or $15 seats, giving the rest of the gigantic
audience a double treat in their propinquity.
     In the picturesque theatre, which had the stars for its canopy and the
full moon for its chandelier, with a lovely green-covered and tree-studded
hill for the backdrop of its broad stage, on which dozens of colored
spotlights were turned throughout the performance, the principal roles of
Shakespeare's fantastic comedy were played by Enid Bennett, who was a queenly
Titania; Conrad Nagel, a romantic Oberon; Viola Dana, who frolicked
delightfully as Puck; Mary Miles Minter as the lovely Helena; Thomas Holding
as Demetrius; Shirley Mason as a fiery and winsom little Herminia; William
Desmond as a dominating Lysander; Stuart Holmes as Theseus; Louise Dresser as
Hippolyta; Patsy Ruth Miller as a fairy; with Francis Powers, Charles Newton,
Wallace Reid, William Russell, Gertrude Astor, Cullen Landis, Gaston Glass
and Dick Sutherland in incidental bits.
     The individual "hits" of the evening were scored by the five comedians,
Charles Ray, who seemed to be having a good time and entertaining others,
too, as Flute, the bellows mender; Larry Semon, who cavorted as Snug, the
joiner and played the lion in their burlesque; Wilson Hummell as Quince;
Mitchell Lewis as Snout; Otis Harlan as a mirth-provoking Starveling, and,
especially, by Lionel Belmore , whose performance as Bottom brought him
repeated applause.
     Then there were the fairies led by Jackie Coogan, Baby Peggy, Gertrude
Messinger, Bob Alexander and Johnny Jones, with dozens of tiny screen kiddies
braving the chilly night in their filmy garments to add the exquisitely
lighted scenes in the forest.  And every one of them were "ever in the
picture," even the tiniest, who grew tired of pirouetting and dashed off to
the wings with a cry of "Oh, daddy," at a very fantastic moment in the play.
     And the pageant.  It was interpolated in the first act to give the vast
audience a chance to see more of their favorites than Shakespeare's cast
permitted.  The pity of it all, however, was that the plan to announce the
stars as they passed in review by electric signs apparently failed to carry
and there were few, even among the professionals in the audience, who could
recognize the pageant beauties in their classic costumes.
     In the pageant were Frank Beal, William Farnum, Claire Windsor, Edna
Purviance, Jane Novak, Lottie Pickford, Kathlyn Williams, Marie Prevost, Ruth
Roland, Mae Busch, Helene Chadwick, Anna Q. Nilsson, Carmel Myers, Florence
Vidor, Wanda Hawley, Mae Murray, Lois Wilson, Bebe Daniels, Agnes Ayres,
Dorothy Phillips, Priscilla Dean and last, but by no means least, Pola Negri.
However, when Miss Negri doffed her headdress and covered her Cleopatra
costume with a gorgeous ermine cape, she appeared in Daniel Frohman's box,
where Charlie Chaplin, Mary O'Connor, Jesse L. Lasky, Marion Fairfax and
Josephine Quirk were among his other guests and, needless to say, the
audience passed and repassed that particular point to glimpse the famous
Polish star and the comedian.  Mr. Chaplin's contribution to the performance
was one of its biggest hits.  With his hair ruffled and the baton in his left
hand, he conducted the orchestra in Mendelssohn's "Spring Song" after the
second act...
     [This was probably Minter's last stage performance.]

     Jesse L. Lasky and the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation have severed all
connections with Mary Miles Minter, one of its most prominent screen stars,
according to an announcement made public in New York today.
     "Miss Minter is working on 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,' which will
close her contract with us," remarked Secretary Goodwin of the executive
offices.  "It has been understood for some time that this picture would
terminate her services."
     Later it was stated to Jesse L. Lasky that Miss Minter expected to
return to the stage and that she is completing negotiations with a theatrical
corporation in New York City with that end in view.
     Mr. Lasky, first vice president of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation
announced: "The contract with Mary Miles Minter and the Famous Player-Lasky
Corporation, which has extended over a period of approximately three years,
was for a certain number of pictures, the last of which is that upon which
she is at present engaged, 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.'
     "I understand that Miss Minter has made her plans for an appearance on
Broadway, which will mark her return to the spoken drama, where she was so
successful before entering on motion picture activities.
     "It may be that her popularity is not sufficient to warrant the
tremendous expense in finding pictures starring her.  As the action was taken
at New York I can not authoritatively discuss it."
     Efforts to communicate with Miss Minter were futile, but it was
announced at the office of her attorney that Miss Minter does not intend to
retire from the screen, in spite of the action of the Famous Players-Lasky
officials.

for us as we were for you."...
