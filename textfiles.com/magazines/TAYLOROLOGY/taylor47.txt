                             What is TAYLOROLOGY?
TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond
Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to
death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major
scandals.  This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life;
(b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor
murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood
silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given
toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it
for accuracy.

                            The Photoplayers' Club

The Photoplayers' Club was the first social organization of the motion
picture industry in Southern California.  It was founded in 1912, at about
the same time that William Desmond Taylor began his movie career.  Taylor
became a very active member of the Photoplayers' Club and was elected an
officer during 1914-1915, foreshadowing his three terms as president of the
Motion Picture Directors' Association.  Like the Screen Club in New York, the
Photoplayers' Club was for men only; some of their social events were "stag"
events, but at some special events (dances, etc.) female guests were
permitted or tickets were sold to the general public.
     The Photoplayers' Club lasted less than three years, and had disbanded
by mid-1915.  Its demise was evidently due to mounting debts from their
clubhouse. All of the items below, which trace the brief history of the
Photoplayers' Club, were datelined at Los Angeles.

     Reel Club Formed at Los Angeles with More than Forty Charter Members
                                       
     Forty-three men, the majority of whose names are widely known throughout
the motion picture world, signed the charter which was drafted at a meeting
just held in this city when the Reel Club of Los Angeles was organized.  The
Los Angeles club is formed along lines almost identical with those of the
Screen Club of New York.  Membership is to be confined to persons connected
with the producing branch of the business and to writers connected with
publications devoted to the industry.
     The meeting, which was held in Brink's Cafe, was the outgrowth of a
movement to form a California branch of the Screen Club, but sentiment seemed
to favor a separate organization and led to the other name being adopted.
     Fred Mace called the meeting to order and was later chosen as temporary
chairman with every prospect that his position as president will be made
permanent.  George H. Melford, director of the Kalem Glendale company,
consented to act as temporary secretary and Charles Giblyn was authorized to
take charge of the organization's funds until permanent officers are chosen.
     A committee appointed to take the necessary steps for a permanent
organization, which includes obtaining articles of incorporation, consists of
Mace, Melford, Frank E. ("Spectator") Woods, T. H. Nash, P. C. Hartigan,
Frank Montgomery and Joseph DeGrasse.
     Before the meeting adjourned, C. A. ("Doc") Willat, treasurer of the New
York Screen Club, was given an opportunity to make a speech.
     Only those who were enrolled at the first meeting will have the honor of
being charter members.  Additional names will have to go before a membership
committee in the usual way.  The full list of the charter members is as
follows:   Charles Avery, Russell Bassett, William Bertram, Al. E. Christie,
Joseph DeGrasse, William C. Dowlan, Charles Edler, Frank Ford, Arthur Forde,
Tom Fortune, Charles Giblyn, P. C. Hartigan, Harry Harvey, Dell Henderson,
Thomas Ince, Edgar Keller, Charles Kessel, Joseph King, David Kirkland,
Harvey Lehrman, Edward Lyons, Donald W. Macdonald, Fred Mace, Arthur Mackley,
Ray S. Manker, George H. Melford, Frank Montgomery, Lee Moran, Lee Morris, E.
L. Morrow, W. Ray Myers, T. H. Nash, Harry Otto, Henry W. Otto, P. M. Powell,
Mack Sennett, J. B. Sherry, Richard Stanton, R. T. Thornby, David Wall,
Raymond B. West, William E. Wing, Frank E. Woods.

     The Reel Club is the latest development on the social horizon of things
motion picturesque.  It was ushered into existence by forty boosters of the
picture world of Los Angeles and vicinity and at the acclaim of the original
forty, more than one hundred directors, producers and players celebrated the
club's second meeting and declared themselves Reel brothers.
     The chairman of the Reelers is Fred Mace.  George Melrose was declared
secretary and Charles Giblyn treasurer.  Ten dollars was decided upon as an
appropriate sum for the purchasing of a membership, one-half of that being
payable upon application.
     Chairman Mace appointed A. L. Christie, Frank Montgomery and W. E. Wing
a committee on constitution and by-laws, the committee being authorized to
employ an attorney to draft necessary papers for making application to the
secretary of state for a charter.
     ...Those who added their names to the list at the second meeting and who
also become charter members are:  Eugene H. Allen, Nick Cogley, Walter
Wright, John E. Brennan, Marshell Milan [sic], Sherman Bambridge, P. H.

                                                         MOVING PICTURE WORLD
     The newly organized Reel Club of Los Angeles, consisting of men engaged
in the producing end of the motion picture industry in Southern California,
has obtained a clubhouse.  A lease has been signed whereby it takes
possession jointly with the Gamut Club of the latter's building in South Hope
Street.  The Gamut Club is an organization of professional musicians.
     The name chosen on the spur of the moment for the new motion picture
organization has not met with the approval of the members and in all
probability it will be changed before the articles of incorporation, which
are now being prepared, are filed with the Secretary of State.  One objection
to the name Reel Club is that it suggests an organization of fishermen.
     Negotiations are now in progress with the Screen Club in New York
looking toward an affiliation of the Los Angeles organization with the New
York organization.

                                                              January 4, 1913
                                                         MOVING PICTURE WORLD
     The Reel Club of Los Angeles, to Southern California what the Screen
Club is to New York, now has 150 members, all of them men actively engaged in
the producing end of the motion picture industry, and it still has a name
which no one is satisfied with, because outsiders mistake it for an
organization of fishermen.
     Naturally, most of the members wanted to call it the Screen Club of Los
Angeles, but would not, of course, take that name without the consent of the
New York organization.
     The Screen Club, when it was officially notified by telegraph that the
California organization had been formed, sent on a letter, asking that the
membership list of the new club be sent to New York City to be censored, and
that $275 in the treasury be sent on also to apply on the dues of $6 a year
which the Southern California members will be expected to pay.  The letter
from the East was read at a meeting of the club, and from the way most of the
members acted, an outsider might have supposed they were very happy about
something.  One of the motion picture producers who was present made an
application for a copy of the letter, saying that he wanted to turn it over
to the scenario editor of his company.  "It would make a scream of a split
reel comedy with very little re-writing," he said.  Another man suggested
that the request of the Screen Club be complied with, and that at the same
time the Screen Club be requested to send on its membership list, so it can
be censored at this end.  "It's only a question of time before all the motion
picture people in the United States will come here to locate," he said, "and
of course, since they will be using our clubrooms, we will want to make sure
they are all desirable."  There was also a suggestion that the Screen Club be
requested to send on $6 for each of its members, since turn about is but fair
play.
     ...As a preliminary to incorporation the club, at its regular meeting
December 14th, elected a full set of officers including 11 directors, who are
to be known as the Board of Control, since the word "director" has a
technical significance in the industry.  As soon as the incorporation is
perfected there will probably be another set of officers elected.  Several of
those who were named pleaded that they are too busy to serve, and only
consented to act for the purpose of getting things started.  The officers
are:  President, Fred Mace; secretary, George H. Melford; treasurer, Charles
Giblyn; directors, Russell Bassett, Charles Giblyn, Joseph DeGrass, P. C.
Hartigan, Arthur Mackley, Frank E. Montgomery, Thomas S. Nash, P. M. Powell,
J. Barney Sherry, William E. Wing and Frank E. Woods.

     "The Photoplayers" is the permanent name which has been adopted for the
club of motion picture people recently formed in this city, under the
temporary name of the Reel Club.  The new name was selected by a popular vote
of the members at a regular meeting held the night of December 21st.  Among
the names which were balloted on but rejected were "Film Club," "Silent Drama
League," "Photo Reel Club," "Cinema Club" and "The Photoplayers' Club."  The
members liked "The Photoplayers," but rejected the word "club" in connection
with it.

     About one hundred members of the Los Angeles Reel Club (temporarily so
named) met at the Gamut Club, on the evening of Saturday, December 21, and by
a unanimous vote of those present, decided that the articles of
incorporation, now being filed at Sacramento, should bear the name of the
"Photo Players" and in the name of the club, a letter was mailed to the New
York kindred club, the Screen Club, so advising and extending the hand of co-
operation and affiliation.
     Another meeting was held Saturday evening, December 28, to decide upon
the permanent leasing of a club house.  Upon this occasion stars from the
Lombardi Opera Company, the Great Raymond, and leading acts from the
vaudeville theaters added to the joy of the affair.
     Among the plans will be a masked ball on or about February 14, and
somewhat later a double-header vaudeville performance by the club members,
who, aided by the auxiliary talent of the actresses employed in the photoplay
industry of Southern California, will present a diversified array of
histrionic ability.

     Plans for the St. Valentine's Ball to be given by the photoplayers on
the night of February 14 have been perfected.  The ball will be given in
Shrine Auditorium, the largest dancing floor in Southern California, having a
capacity of 6,000 persons.  William E. Wing has been appointed "manager of
the ball" and will devote his entire time to it between now and the big date.
Nearly all of the local exhibitors have agreed to run stereopticon slides in
their houses for a week before the event and advertising space has been
contracted for in all the daily newspapers.  Every member of the
organization, which now comprises practically every motion picture actor,
director and camera man in this locality, is to be required to be on hand
with his white breasted clothes.  The women of the various production
companies have promised to help in every way in their power, so that there is
a reasonable prospect that the industry will be well represented.  As for the
public; tickets are one dollar and everything else thrown in.

     The Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles is to dance, on St. Valentine's
night, at the Shrine Auditorium.  The first ticket to the club's first ball
brought seventy-five dollars, David Wall securing the ticket and the honor
its possession entails.  There was sharp rivalry for the purchase of the
ticket by Frank Montgomery, James Young Deer and Mr. Wall, the two latter
each bidding the purchase price and Mr. Young Deer losing out on account of
his not yet having signed a membership blank.  Before his extended fee of
five dollars could change hands, Mr. Wall was declared owner of the disputed
ticket.  W. E. Wing is chairman of the entertainment committee and other
committees were appointed by President Mace.

     The Photoplayers' benefit ball, which is to take place on the evening of
February 14, at the Shrine Auditorium, promises to be one of the greatest
social events of the entire season.
     Practically all arrangements for this gigantic dancing party have been
completed by the committee in charge; and judging from the sale of tickets
reported by members of the profession, it will be better attended than any
benefit ball ever held in this city.
     It has been definitely decided that the ball will be strictly a formal
affair. No costumes are to be worn by either the motion picture artists or
the guests.  Only those dressed in the conventional attire are to be allowed
on the ball-room floor.
     The reason given by the members of the committee for this arrangement is
so that it will give the guests an opportunity to meet the photoplayers as
they appear in private life rather than in the parts they play for production
on the canvas.
     Saturday night [February 8], the picture players are to parade the
streets of this city.  This parade is expected to be one of the most novel
ever seen in Los Angeles.  Practically all the companies working in this
section will be represented in the line of march.
     Wild animals, automobiles, Indians, cowboys and prize horses, are to be
among the features of the column.
     Police protection has been granted and the official route is to be
announced tomorrow.
     The Selig company will furnish the wild animal feature.  "Big" Otto has
been appointed marshal of this division and has had his big automobile
decorated with a new coat of red paint especially for the occasion.
     "Toddles," the educated elephant, known to members of the film
profession as the "King of Comedy," is to ride on a big motor truck with
"Curley," his trainer.  Lion "Duke," the "King of Tragedy," is to ride in his
cage on a truck.
     Hobart Bosworth is to ride "Busy" his trained horse.
     Henry McRae and Miss Kathlyn Williams are to lead the automobiles of the
company.  The local Selig branch has fourteen machines and they are all to be
in the parade Saturday night.
     The Universal, is to be well represented by cowboys and Indians.  Four-
year-old Mattie, leader of the juvenile colony at Universal City and his
father, H. C. Mathews, are to ride horses.
     Indians and cowboys will also be in the column from the 101 Bison
company.
     A large automobile fleet is to carry members of the Kalem company.
     Fred Mace in his big touring car is to lead the Keystone division.
     Miss Elenor Blevins is to ride in her own machine.
     According to C. L. Card, there will be more than 100 automobiles in the
line, aside from the many other features offered by the different companies.

     The Los Angeles Photoplayers' Club now has a membership of 230 and is
expected to pass the New York Screen Club in point of numbers within a very
short time.
     This organization was born November 27, with a membership of forty-five.
     Fred Mace sent out fifty letters and forty-five film stars met at
Brink's for a little informal supper.  The plan was announced and all those
present paid the sum of $5 into the treasury and became charter members of
the Photoplayers' Club.
     Meetings have been held regularly each week since the organization.

     The Photoplayers is now a sure enough club.  Following the arrival of
the organization's charter from the Secretary of State, the members held
their first formal election of officers the night of January 10 and chose
Fred Mace, of the Keystone Company, president.  Mace had been serving as
temporary president and was entitled to the honor which was given him
unanimously.  That the club exists today is due more to his efforts than
those of any other person.
     The other officers elected were Arthur Mackley, of the Essanay, and
Joseph DeGrass, of the Pathe, first and second vice presidents respectively;
George Melford, of the Kalem, secretary; William E. Wing, corresponding
secretary, and Charles Giblyn, treasurer.

     Seventeen seems to be the new magic membership number for The
Photoplayers.  At each of the last three meetings seventeen new members have
been taken in.  The total active membership is now very close to 250.  The
next meeting is certain to produce enough new members to put the club over
the 250 mark.  That a social organization of such proportions could be formed
in about two months exclusively among men actively engaged in the production
of motion pictures shows what an important producing center Los Angeles has
grown to be.  The members of the club held a special election at their last
meeting to decide which of the many leading women of the Southern California
companies should lead the grand march with President Fred Mace at the St.
Valentine's ball in Shrine Auditorium the night of February 14.  There were
22 nominations and Mabel Normand, of the Keystone company, won by a small
margin.

     Fred Mace, founder and president of the Photoplayers, has at last
announced the official route of the Photoplayers' parade, which is scheduled
for Saturday night.
     The parade is to form at Tenth street and Grand avenue at 7 o'clock.
The lime of the march is north on Grand to Eighth, east on Eighth to
Broadway, north on Broadway to Second, east on Second to Spring, south on
Spring to Ninth, east on Ninth to Main, north on Main to Temple and disband.
     An escort of mounted police is to lead the pageant.  President Mace and
Miss Mabel Normand are to head the parade in a decorated automobile.
According to the Executive Committee, there will be more than 200 machines in
line, carrying the managers and directors of the forty-four companies located
here and members of their companies...
     Richard Garrick has been appointed chief marshal and Tom Santchez, vice-
marshal...
     Tom Santchez, the husky sergeant-at-arms of the Photoplayers, has been
instructed to muster a band of brother screen actors of equal husk for the
heavy service at the Photoplayers' ball, which is to be held at the Shrine
Auditorium, February 14.  With this crew on the floor there is little chance

     Henry McRae, the Selig director, has studded with electric lights the
automobile in which he and Kathlyn Williams will ride in the Photoplayer's
parade Saturday night.  Not willing to be outdone, Fred Mace, president of
The Photoplayers, has rigged lights both inside and outside of the car in
which he and Miss Mabel Normand will lead the parade.

     Prominent photoplayers, representing practically all of the forty-five
companies operating in Los Angeles, gathered at the Selig studios in Edendale
last night to rehearse the grand march for the photoplayers' ball, which is
to be held at the Shrine Auditorium this evening.
     Besides the rehearsal, a brief business meeting was held by officers and
members of the Photoplayers.
     The tickets for the ball which were not sold, were turned in and an
accounting took place.  It was discovered that out of the 10,000 tickets
issued there were 9856 sold.
     It was decided to sell tickets at the office of the Shrine Auditorium
before the ball this evening, as many have become interested in the ball
during the last two days and have not been able to secure their tickets.
     This promises to be the greatest ball ever held in Los Angeles.  There
will be a great many of those who have tickets who will not attend, but there
should be at least 8000 people in the ballroom.
     According to members of the Executive Committee, 1800 couples may dance
on the Shrine floor at one time with comfort.  Naturally there will be a
great many people at the ball as spectators, and these will in no way crowd
the dancers, as there is a seating capacity for several thousand people in
the building.
     The music is to be furnished by a band of twenty-two pieces ant there
has been nothing left undone by those in charge of the affair, which would
tend to add to the enjoyment of the guests.

                            They Really Have Voices
                  Photoplayers Meet Audience and Say "Hello"
                  Their Inaugural Ball Very Largely Attended
                    Ten Thousand Dollars for Clubhouse Fund
                                       
     Friends of years standing heard one another speak for the first time
last night at the photoplayers' inaugural ball in Shrine Auditorium.  Actors
in the motion pictures met and mingled with their audience and greatly
enjoyed the experience.  The audience long had wondered what the voices of
their favorites sounded like, and how these men and women of a make-believe
world really looked in the flesh.  Curiosity in this direction was pleasantly
gratified at this remarkably successful affair.
     Nearly 10,000 tickets were sold and more than half that number of
persons attended the event.  Even before the grand march virtually every seat
was occupied.  The scene was one of brilliant color.  Beautiful women more
familiar to the onlookers in the guise of western heroines, picturesquely
attired in rough-and-ready garments known to the plains in pioneer days were
there in gorgeous gowns of Parisian make, but they were recognized just the
same.
     Devotees of the moving picture shows were as interested in picking their
photo-drama friends from the merry throng as they would have been in
witnessing their actions in the latest thrilling melodrama of the theater
screen.  A spirit of the utmost friendliness pervaded the atmosphere and the
hosts and hostesses made it manifest that they were delighted to be in such
close touch with the people who their principal purpose in life it is to
entertain.  The entertainment last night was in different form than they had
ever before offered in Los Angeles, and it was all the more enjoyable on that
account.
     Fred Mace, president of the Photoplayers' Club, and Miss Mabel Normand,
leading lady of the Keystone Company, led the grand march, in which eighty-
four couples, all prominent members of the local photoplay colony,
participated.  There were nearly 2000 motion picture actors and actresses in
attendance, but only the leading men and women, the directors and the
managers, appeared in the opening number.  Elaborate gowns were very much in
evidence.
     The twenty-four dances were cleverly marked on the programme.  There was
the "Mace meander" and then came the "studio stumble."  The dramatic drag,
silent slide, camera cavort, screen scoot, reel rave, foreground frolic,
actors' amble, hospital hop, directors' dirge, switchback sway and pay-day
prance, were some of the others.
     Los Angeles is the present home of forty-five moving picture companies
and all of them were represented almost in their entirety.  Besides the
Southern California notables several photoplay persons of the East were in
attendance.  Among these were Dave Horsley, one of the owners of the Nestor
Company, whose home is in New York; Charles O. Bauman of New York, president
of the New York Motion Picture Company; E. A. Smith of New York, president of
the Vitagraph Company; Samuel Long of New York, president of the Kalem
Company; Charles Kessel of New York, general manager of the New York Motion
Picture Company, and F. J. Balshofer, another official of this same company.
     The proceeds of the ball will be devoted to a fund being raised for the
construction of a home for the Photoplayers' Club.  The programme alone
netted $3200, thanks to the heavy advertising patronage.  The ticket sales
amounted to nearly $10,000.  Plans for the clubhouse are only tentative as
yet, and its location has not been decided upon, but steps in this direction
will be taken in the near future.
     All members of the club constituted the reception committee last night.
Richard Garrick was floor manager, and members of the Board of Control were
his assistants.

                                                                   MOTOGRAPHY
                       How the Photoplayers Club Did It
                               Their First Ball
                                       
     The Los Angeles Photoplayers' ball Valentine's night was a
disappointingly fine affair, as the Los Angeles Examiner expressed it.  One
expected to see yelling "Injuns" and fat Dutchmen and cowboys and poor but
beautiful girls, too.
     All this dream had to be discarded when one got a look at the ballroom
scene in the big Shrine Auditorium, for it was very much like several
brilliant predecessors.  The men didn't dash in and say, "Halt!" or
"Curses!"; no damsels were succored, of trustful females there were none; one
did not glimpse any squalor or wretchedness.  Nothing of all this happened.
     On the contrary this affair merged all of them into a uniform
assemblage, the women in their kinemacolor clothes and the men with the open-
face accoutrement--in other words, evening garb.
     The best known characters of the film world were there.  There were
comedy men, serious men, character men, juveniles; there were heroes and
villains, kings and beggars, saints and thieves; then, of course, there were
heroines and poor little shop girls and old maids and little country lassies;
in fact, nothing missing.
     The cruel landlord who that very afternoon had driven the supplicating
woman and her three weeping children out into the cold world for want of
twenty-five cents for the rent was discovered in agreeable conversation with
the same woman, whereas the children were trying the waxed floor for long
distance effects in sliding.
     It was one of the biggest dancing crowds the auditorium every
accommodated, perhaps the biggest, and none ever could have been more
decorous.  A few individuals somewhat inclined to levity had suggested that
"ragging" might be desirable when things warmed up a bit.
     It is to be written very severely that there was no "ragging."  A man
with a megaphone mounted into the band stand and executed a decisive flank
movement on all this kind of motive by announcing that any one who tried to
"rag" would suffer the ignominy of ejection.  The giddy waltz, two-step,
etc., had to suffice.
     It is a noteworthy fact that Los Angeles can assemble more photoplayers
than any other city in the country, also more noted ones.  The forty-two
companies operating in and around the city were all so numerously represented
that everybody came but the livestock.  Also most of them arrived in
automobiles, which is a pretty good argument there were no Cinderallas or
their male prototypes on hand.
     The venerable dean of moving picture actors is Charles, otherwise "Pop,"
Manley.  He is 82.  He could have been playing in pictures before the Civil
War had they been invented then; however, he has been an actor longer than
that.  Naturally he takes the part of an old man, though he doesn't look so
old.  However, by dint of making up he gets the proper effect.
     Another of those who can't play juvenile parts any more is Russell
Bassett, aged 66.  His record is 45 years an actor.  He is the funny old man
when you see him on the screen.  He is the humorous father or perhaps the fat
farmer who was so surprised at seeing his dude son come home from college he
tipped over the pail of milk, then got mad and kicked the cow, also the son.
     Among the throbbing throng was discoverable Charles Murray, formerly of
Murray and Mack.   Mr. Murray says he has played everything up to date but a
lizard.  He and Jack Dillon, another comedian, together played a horse, and
got a big laugh for the stunt--a horse laugh, maybe.  Murray says it's great
to be in the photoplay game.  He's gained eighteen pounds in the open air and
sunshine, and his beautiful wife, who is well known on the stage, watches him
do funny things and laughs so much she says she is getting fat.
     You couldn't help seeing those wonderful children, Matty and Early.  Two
guesses are required to know, from the names, which is the boy and which the
girl.  The only violation of the anti-rag rule emanated from the active minds
and was transferred to the radio-active persons of Matty, the boy, and Early,
the girl.  After a moment, however, the girl gave the boy a biff and said she
had had enough.  So much for the decorousness of it.
     Arthur Mackley is a villain.  But, let it be added, only when he's being
wound up in the moving picture reel for delivery to all parts of the
habitable globe.  There isn't a place on the several continents where they
have enough enterprise to get a moving picture show that Mr. Mackley hasn't
caused many an emotion of rage and hate, but he always gets "come up with."
He was one of the most benign and genial men at the ball.
     To forget Fred Mace, president of the Photoplayers' Club and one of the
most popular of moving picture comedians, would be an omission as serious as
Mace is funny.  He led the grand march with Miss Mabel Normand, a leading
woman.  It was a beautiful, not to say gorgeous, grand march, but Mr. Mace
did not try to be funny.
     Miss Mary Charleson recently made a great hit--she is said to be always
making them--by doing a picture all by herself, just she and her hat.  She
didn't have the hat this night, but the famous moving picture referred to
couldn't have been any more effective than the one she made.
     Besides the photoplayers the audience comprised between 2,000 and 3,000
friends and spectators, and not half of those who came to dance could find
room on the floor at the same time.  The proceeds of the ball constitute the
foundation for a fund which will be used to build a clubhouse for the actors
belonging to the Photoplayers'.

     ...In the same company [Powers] is "Pop" Manley, who will soon attain
four-score and ten and who without any doubt is the oldest actor in the
pictures.  In consideration of his age, his standing and the esteem in which
everyone connected with motion pictures holds him, The Photoplayers, by
unanimous vote, at their last business meeting, elected him as the first
honorary life member of the new organization.

     After three months of wanderings The Photoplayers have finally come to
rest in a home of their own.  Members of the board of control this week
signed a lease for the three-story building at 349 South Hill Street, in the
heart of the downtown business district.  The club will occupy the two upper
floors, the ground floor being occupied by a cafe.  The building was erected
for the use of the University Club and was occupied by that organization
until its membership grew so large that it was compelled to seek more
commodious quarters.  However, there is room for a club of up to 500 members
and The Photoplayers at the present time has a little less than 300, so the
rooms will probably not be overcrowded for a year at least.
     No sooner had the lease been signed than a force of decorators was put
at work redecorating the entire interior.  The rooms will have practically
every convenience common to men's clubs and will be one of the most
comfortable in the city.

     With about $5,000 worth of new furniture and other equipment scattered
about the building "The Photoplayers" formally opened their new clubrooms the
night of March 8.  The headquarters of the organization, which now has nearly
300 members, are located at 349 South Hill Street.  On the first floor there
is a library filled with bookcases, reading tables and comfortable chairs, a
huge lounging room with a wide fireplace, settles, great deep club chairs and
smoking stands, a Dutch stein room, a dining-room and a well equipped
kitchen, in which there are accommodations for serving a banquet for between
300 and 400 persons, and a secretary's office.  On the second floor there is
a large billiard room, with two pool and two billiard tables, and seats
around the walls, an English tap room, a dressing room, a large bathroom with
showers, a committee room, two guests' chambers, a room for the steward and a
storeroom.  Every stick of furniture in the club was bought new, the walls
were all decorated and they and the rugs, carpets draperies and hangings form
a color scheme in which soft warm browns predominate.

     Members of "The Photoplayers" Club entertained their women friends
April 9, when the first "Ladies' Night" in the new club home was held.  The
rooms were filled with cut flowers, there was special music and refreshments
and after the reception which occupied the early hours of the evening there
was an informal dance lasting until midnight.  About 200 women guests were
entertained, many of them famous in the motion picture profession.

     The second public appearance of The Photoplayers will probably be made
the first week in June, when the club will give a burlesque show in the
Temple Auditorium in this city for three nights and a matinee.  At a general
meeting of the club held last Saturday night a committee was appointed to
make the preliminary plans and report back to the club at a special meeting
next Saturday night.  At that time the members will decide whether the data
as presented by the committee justifies the move.  The committee will make a
favorable report, and since the sentiment in the club is strongly in favor of
the show it will probably be given.  [No announcements indicated the show was
actually given.]

     After four futile efforts to adopt a new constitution and by-laws at a
general meeting of the club members, the Photoplayers have decided to hold a
two weeks' election to decide whether the new regulations shall be adopted or
rejected.  The constitution was proposed by the board of control at a regular
meeting, but action was deferred until a larger attendance could be obtained.
Three times thereafter meetings were held, but at each succeeding meeting the
attendance shrank and the board of control was unwilling to have a matter of
such importance acted upon unless the action could be taken as the general
sentiment of the members.  Accordingly it has now been decided to place a
ballot box in the club rooms for a period of two weeks, during which most of
the members will have an opportunity to express themselves.

     W. Hanson Durham, the scenario editor at the Western Vitagraph company
--or, rather--companies, at Santa Monica, has returned to his desk at the
studio after an absence of nearly three months.  On March 8 he paid his first
visit to the club rooms of The Photoplayers, and before he had been in the
building five minutes he slipped on a steep staircase and fell down a flight
of stairs.  One of his knees was broken and for several weeks thereafter he
performed his duties in a hospital room.  To keep three active directors busy
is no snap for a well man, but Durham managed to hold the job down without
assistance during all the time he was incapacitated.
     The adoption of a new constitution and by-laws made it necessary for The
Photoplayers to elect four additional members on the board of control, making
fifteen in all.  There were nine nominations for the places--Henry Otto, Jack
O'Brien, Allan Dwan, J. E. LeSaint, Al Filson, George Gebhart, J. A. Crosby,
Marshall Neilan and Wilbert Melville.  Mr. Melville withdrew because he has
plans which will require him to be absent from the city for some time and the
balloting resulted in the election of Otto, Filson, Crosby and O'Brien.

     In Benny Singer, the Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles possesses a live
manager.  He not only runs the club with efficiency, but keeps the good will
of all its members.  Mr. Singer is from New York, and was for a long time
connected with the Palmer and Madison Theaters, while he was stage director
for many of the Hoyt productions.  He also had a long experience with club
and hotel business, being either manager or head steward for hotels in New
York, Buffalo, San Antonio, Texas, and Los Angeles.  He ran the hotel at
Redondo Beach among others.  Mr. Singer firmly believes that the Photoplayers
Club will be one of the foremost Bohemian clubs in the states, and it is
surely heading that way.  The latest innovation is a Saturday night beefsteak
dinner--it is a popular one, too.

     At the Wednesday dinner at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles, the boys
did a graceful thing when they sang the special song composed and written by
Photoplayers McCoy and Brady into a phonographic record--said song being
written about Fred Mace, the absent president.  Later the boys filed past the
record and said nice things to Fred.  The records were perfect and have been
shipped to Mace, and all are betting that he will spend most of his time in
front of a gramophone.  Fred is missed, all right.

     It was ladies' night at the Photoplayers' Club, Los Angeles, last
Saturday night and the rooms were crowded.  Visitors came from Santa Paula,
San Diego and Santa Barbara.  The program comprised of music and dancing.
Everyone looks forward to ladies' night at the club.  "Daddy" Charles Manley
and his wife came to bid the photoplayers good-bye and were presented with
some beautiful flowers.  Daddy tried to make a speech, but broke down.  This
fine old actor, who is 83 years of age, is returning to his home in the East.

     At the Photoplayers' Club in Los Angeles recently, popular Allan Dwan
took the chair and kept things going in capital style.  Carl Laemmle was the
guest of honor and before the evening was through he was a life member.  He
made a graceful speech and was enthusiastic over his reception and everything
pertaining to the club.  Robert Leonard delivered two poems, one in praise of
Allan Dwan and the other welcoming Mr. Laemmle, both by Richard Willis, and
Bob's reading was immense.  The club is going forward with leaps and bounds

     His numerous fellow members of the Photoplayers' organization of Los
Angeles are delighted to hear that the wife of True Boardman, of the Western
Essanay's players, has perpetuated herself, so to speak, in a small edition
of herself which she presented to her husband recently.  The Club sent True
the official communication:  "Congratulations and best wishes to the little
angel who has come to bless your lives.  I read the announcement to sixty
Photoplayers who were gathered about the Fellowship dinner-table and there
were rousing cheers of 'God bless the little darling!'  A toast was proposed
by Toastmaster Mackley and all present drank to your daughter's health and
long life.  Hy. W. Otto, Secretary, The Photoplayers."  The Mackley referred
to is Arthur Mackley who used to be one of Essanay's most popular players.

can be gathered of interest to the public.  The other evening in "swapping"

how, at the age of fourteen, he ran away with a canvas circus show, touring

escaped one night, and beat his way to Canada, fearful lest he be caught.
Herbert always goes to see a circus erect its canvas now, and often sees them
fold them too.  It fascinates him.

     Wednesday, November 26, was a memorable night at the Photoplayers' Club.
In the first place it was the first birthday of the club and in the second
place the Toastmaster was no other than the Club's president, Fred Mace, who
returned to "his own" and everybody elses satisfaction.  It was one great
evening.  Fire Chief Ely was the guest of honor and he gave a humorous speech
in which he accused Herbert Rawlinson of trying to put three of his fireman
out of business, in doing a dangerous stunt.  Herbert loosened a block of
wood which fell and injured a carpenter and just escaped the "really truly"
firemen who held the net below.  Rawlinson was called upon to defend himself
and threatened to either make a speech or put the blame on the leading lady!
Being chivalrous gentlemen, the club members sorrowfully accepted the speech.
It was surely some night!

     The Photoplayers' Club had one great big night recently, when Frank E.
Montgomery, the popular Kalem director, was toastmaster and provided the
entertainment.  The entrance to the dining hall was a huge teepee and the
walls of the hall were covered with costly Indian relics, whilst the table
cloths were Indian blankets and on every plate was an Indian gift.  During
the dinner Mona Darkfeather, in full Indian costume, ran down the hall and
sang an original song dedicated to the club.  She was vociferously applauded.
At a given signal, another teepee opened and out came eight Indians in full
war paint and gave a dance which brought the diners to their feet.  There was
an Indian poem of welcome to "Monty," by Richard Willis, and the usual yarns
and speeches interspersed with cabaret artists.  It was a novel and costly
entertainment and was much enjoyed by everybody present.  The supper is still
the talk of the town.

     At the Photoplayers' Club on Christmas eve the bachelors held high jinks

     Summed up in one word, the Photoplayers' ball last night was as
follows:  Clothes.  Another might be added, to-wit:  Pulchritude.  It only
costs a nickel to go to a picture show, but there were five blocks of
automobiles around the Shrine Auditorium.
     These are a few leading observations.  It was a gala event, in all
respects scrumptious.  However, the clothes scintillated upon all sides even
more impressively than the automobiles shone outside.  The latest thing were
those pantalettes from Paris.  They are so late, indeed, that you have to
set your watch a little ahead.  The girl who wore them had beautiful blond
hair and blue eyes, and--
     But, alas, she has disappeared in the crowd, lost in the well known
mazes, etc., and here comes Miss Kathlyn Williams with a Worth creation
creating admiration, the desire to emulate and various other poetic
emotions.  Miss Williams walks into lion's dens and like Daniel, she never
gets bit.  This is not because she isn't courageous.  Unlike the ancient
hero she gets her picture on the screen and is a great favorite.  She didn't
look like lions and tigers last night when she led the grand march with Fred
Mace.  No, very demure.
     Mace was the patron saint of the Photoplayers' Club.  He brought seven
pairs of white gloves, which were stuffed about him here and there, giving
him some embonpoint.  The reason for this equipment was his handshaking
stunt and getting the gloves soiled.
     There were many jolly looking persons.  Most of these were tragedians.
Those sad looking persons you may have seen are the comedians.  They were
not losing any of their temperament; their sadness and their gladness,
whichever they make the money with, was all pent up.  None of it got
spilled.
     What of the man who makes you roar by being kicked down the stairs into
an ash barrel and coming up all sooty and sputtering?  He was there.  He was
wearing a low front effect, a narrow isthmus of vest skirting the southern
side of a broad sea of shirt.  Innocent looking villains moved about; it was
hard to hate them.  You could almost forget some of those crimes they have
committed.  Cowboys who hang by a toe and an eyelash to a "rarin'" broncho
while they pick the maiden from the edge of the cliff; they were plentiful,
but proper.  No guns on the hip.  Even clothes and a ballroom transformed
them.
     Oh, movies, what strenuosities are committed in thy name!  Miss
Margaret Loveridge, who has beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes, is going to
remain a leading woman because she has conquered the demon fat it was
whispered.  The same may be said of Miss Betty Schade, who had to walk 1100
miles before the manager, sighting along the curve of her chin, said she
would do for a leading woman.  The famous line of Cassius's, "Let me have
men about me that are fat," doesn't apply to women in the moving picture
business unless it's for comedy.
     "Pop" Bassett came, of course.  He is the Nestor of the game.  He was
there last year, but is several years younger now.
     Anna Little, the "Indian" girl of the reel life, is very un-Indian in
real life--no war-whoops at all.
     Charlie Murray, they said, has a pair of green trousers which he
expected to wear, but his courage failed him.  His legs got to shaking and
shied from the green.
     Laura Oakley, formerly sheriff of Universal City, did not fall in love
last night--particularly, that is.  She said she loved everybody.  "Jim"
McGee, with that famous earnest look of his, who is used to mingling with
the wild animals out at Eastlake, was exceedingly unsavage.  He doesn't have
to have beasts of prey around him to be nice.
     Colonel Pryce, late of the insurrecto army, did not shoot anyone.
Another milk-looking man with a history of sanguinary potentialities.
     Take them by and large, they were a wilderness, and when you see them
in the pictures they are terrible or side-splitting, sad or poor, happy or
rich--all things, in fact--but at a ball they are "just folks."  C. De Vidal-
Hundt managed the affair.

     The Photoplayers Club of Los Angeles held their second annual ball at
the huge Shrine Auditorium on St. Valentine's night. It was a brilliant
affair in every respect and benefited the Photoplayers artistically and
financially. From the time the band struck the first stirring strains for the
impressive grand march with its beautiful women and handsome men and the
wonderful dresses to the time the last of the boys returned to the club to
discuss the function by the rising sun, there was no hitch with the possible
exception that the floor was uncomfortably crowded at times. It is no use
giving a list of "those present" for everybody who was anybody "don't you
know" graced the ball with his or her august presence.  A souvenir ball album
containing signed photographs of the stars was put up at auction and realized
$500, being knocked down to Fred Balshofer.

     One good diversion the photoplayers of this locality have is the good
fellowship dinner on Wednesday evening when the elite of the studios fare
forth to partake of a feast, and to enjoy a good smoke and chat.  Last week
the spread was that of a kingly kind.  Max Asher was the mystifying toast
general, and he carried off the honors with a comedy night of fun.  Max is of
German descent, and every member, in honor of the toaster's nativity, wore
chin "viskers" and amputated derby hats.  The gathering looked like a
horseshoe table of a thousand twins.  Everyone looked the same, and the
thousand and three laughs that were made filled the diners with delight.  Not
satisfied with good jokes, musical numbers and other entertainment, the
comical Asher borrowed a pair of tangoers who performed some wonderfully
clever dances, to the great admiration of the assemblage.

film players were going to desert the Photoplayer's club if the men did not
appear on Ladies' nights in evening dress.  The story went on to tell that
Jack Dillon was beloved, because he was the only attender in the conventional
costume.  He denies the story emphatically.  Informal have been these
affairs, and informal they will be, say the men folks.

     In reminiscing at the Los Angeles Photoplayers' Club one evening last
week, Charles Ray, the Kay-Bee lead, was describing his feelings when Thomas
Ince handed him his first contract.  He says it is the first time that he
ever felt at all important, but the feeling soon wore off when he showed it
on the quiet to an old timer who squinted sideways at it and said "Huh!  I've
got a box full of them."

     At the regular weekly meeting of the Photoplayers, Inc., an organization
of actors and directors with a membership of more than 450, held Saturday
evening, July 25, the directors announced they had received a cable from Fred
Mace, now in Paris, resigning the presidency of the organization, and that
Joseph De Grasse, director for the Universal, had been elected to fill the
office for the remainder of the unexpired term.
     William T. Taylor [sic], director of the Balboa company, was selected as
vice-president, and Bertram Bracken was named a director.

     For some time past, owing to the absence of Fred Mace in Europe, the
Photoplayers' Club of Los Angeles has been without a resident head and owing
to the calls of the beaches and hills during the Summer season the interest
in the club sagged a lot and the members in good standing met in several "get
together" conclaves with the result that interest has been revived and the
club was never in a more prosperous condition than now. On the night of the
twenty-ninth of July, a supper was given by the members who attended with
their sweethearts and wives, an excellent repast in which a cabaret
performance by members figured, followed by a dance. One hundred and forty
sat down to the supper and the event was so successful that it will be
repeated monthly. Joseph De Grasse is the present president of the club,
William D. Taylor, the vice president, and Bert Bracken, the second vice
president.

     A Photoplayers gambol is to be the big attraction in Los Angeles within
the next few weeks, according to plans made at the weekly meeting of the
Photoplayers, Inc., Saturday evening, July 25, at their club rooms on Hill
Street.
     At this regular meeting the idea was suggested and received with cheers
on all sides.  Rupert Julian, formerly of the Little Theatre here, and lead
in several big successes of London theatres, who is now with the Universal at
the Hollywood studio, was selected as chairman of a committee to make
arrangements for the first annual frolic.
     Among the members of the Photoplayers are scores of former stage stars,
and all present gladly promised to do their part.  Charles Murray, of Murray
and Mack, is with the Keystone Company, and was the first to respond to the
call for assistance with a number for the program.
     ...The program will probably be staged in four or five weeks and the net
receipts will go to the treasury of the organization...

     We had a great supper at the Photoplayers' Club last Wednesday, although
the pleasures were tinctured with some reserve, for it was virtually a good-
bye dinner to Henry Walthall, who is leaving for the East. How we do hate to
see him go, for Wally is one of the most lovable of fellows as well as being
an accomplished motion picture actor. We made it very clear to him that he
was leaving some good pals behind.

     The Photoplayers held their first annual gambol at the Mason Friday and
Saturday nights, and there was a collection of stars and near-stars, behind
and before the footlights, that would have made the most blase press agent
weep for joy.
     Everybody in filmland was there, and the lobby was a veritable florist
shop, while eager men sought to buy candy, flowers and programmes from the
host of leading ladies and ingenues that seemed nearly unable to supply the
demand. Film heroes and heroines stepped from the portrait frames with a
cordiality that gave the whole affair an informal touch and made it such a
splendid success. Miss Laura Oakley, Chief of Police of Universal City, kept
the enormous crowd moving in the already packed theatre.
     The audience was nearly as interesting as the show itself. It included
Isadore Bernstein, Mayor of Universal City; Mabel Van Buren, Beatrice Van,
Vera Sisson, Anna Little, Dorothy Davenport, Bessie Eyton, Edith Johnson,
Elsie Greeson, Enid Markey, Leona Hutton, Stella  Razeto, the Gish sisters,
Cleo Madison, Grace Cunard, Mabel Normand, Carlyle Blackwell, Billy Stowell,
George Periolot, Donald Crisp, Bobby Harron, William Clifford, Herbert
Rawlinson, James Singleton, Wallace Reid, J. Warren Kerrigan, Harry Carter,
Tom Mix, Sidney Smith, Cortenay Foote and D. W. Griffith. There were many
others in evening dress making the rounds of the boxes greeting friends and
admirers.
     Tom Wilson opened the song programme with original parodies that held
the audience from the start. His appearance in blackface was a
disappointment, as every one wanted to see him as he appeared on the screen.
     In excellent voice and with a choice collection of semi-classical songs,
Myrtle Stedman of Bosworth, Inc., earned the plaudits of the audience.
     Then came Ben Deeley with his famous "Good Old Common Sense" song, and
scored a hit. He was called to give an encore, and sang his latest popular
success, "My Heart's Way Out in California," which he put over in a fashion
that finally forced him to make a short speech, which was a gem in itself.
     "Discovered," a short sketch, featuring Kathlyn Williams and a group of
Selig Players, was replete with tense situations, and the comedy climax
surprised and delighted every one. Miss Williams was ably assisted by Guy
Oliver, Wheeler Oakman, Charles Clary, and Jack McDonald. The act was superb,
every one scored a personal success. Mr. Clary as the friend, and Mr. Oakman
as the husband, were especially good, easily maintaining their reputations
behind the footlights that they have gained before the camera.
     Max Asher with a patter act assisted by a pack of cards, showed a
dexterity with the pasteboards that won him instant favor. In faultless
evening clothes and grand opera voice, Wm. Worthington rendered operatic
selections to good advantage.
     George Cohan's first sketch, with its laughable lines, was offered with
great success by Filson & Errol, who gave it the first production, and from
the way the house enjoyed it proved that it has not outgrown popularity. "The
Tip on the Derby" was very good.
     After the intermission Ruth Roland, assisted by Harry McCoy at the
piano, proceeded to stop the show, the audience not being satisfied till the
supes brought the piano back and the pair sang another song. Miss Roland left
nothing to be desired either in her singing or her gowns, and the patter of
the act brought one continuous roar of laughter.
     Charley Murray, of Murray & Mack, offered a monologue up to his usual
standard, and was given a big hand.
     "The Sheriff of the Shasta," that Theodore Roberts made famous, was
offered with a cast that made the sketch far superior to its presentation in
vaudeville. Mr. Roberts is always good and, as the sheriff, he was a delight.
Miss Smythe, the only one of the original case, was equal to bearing the only
female role of the piece, and her scenes with Mr. Roberts were in her usual
inimitable manner. Murdock McQuarrie, as the jealous husband, and Hobart
Bosworth, as the acrobat, played these parts as only such actors of sterling
quality are able.
     Lydia Yeamans Titus, with songs and character studies, fully contributed
to the enjoyment of the affair.
     The Oz Film Company presented Violet McMillan, Frank Moore and Fred
Woodward. Miss McMillan has often been compared to a doll and, as she dances
like a sprite, her success was always assured. Woodward and Moore were great,
and "Hank" is a favorite wherever he goes. This trio presented one of the
cleverest acts on the programme, while one of the best dancing teams in
vaudeville closed a show that will be always be remembered and a credit to
the photo-players.

     The Photoplayers' Club raised some $1,200 with their vaudeville
performance recently, but this was not enough to cover the club's
indebtedness.  At a general meeting last Wednesday Isidore Bernstein suggested
bonds in values of $10, $20 and $50 denominations, and in less than five
minutes another $1,200 was raised by those present and today the club is free
from debt with a new spirit at the back of it.  The Photoplayers' Club is far
too valuable to allow it to go by the board and the "buck up" was very
necessary.

Wednesday night the supper had a bumper attendance, and Carl Laemmle was
among "those present." The members have raised bonds among themselves to the
tune of over $2,000, and this, with the $1,200 raised by the vaudeville
performance, has cleared the club of debt and placed it on a good footing
again. Apart from this the right spirit has again been infused into the club,
and its future is of the brightest. On Saturday a tango supper will be held,
and the ladies have promised to be there in force. Good!

     The Photoplayers' Club has conferred the honor upon Mary Pickford and J.
Warren Kerrigan of having their pictures upon the official programme of the
annual dance.  Although several people of the film world bid for the position
it was decided that these two popular players should have the place.
     This ball will in all probability be one of the largest affairs that the
club has ever attempted, and judging from the advance sale of tickets the
auditorium will be taxed to its utmost capacity.  There are more of the film
folk in Los Angeles now than have ever been here before, and it is expected
that the majority will attend and eclipse all previous occasions.
     As each celebrity enters the hall the name will be announced in order
that the public may see how their favorites look in real life, and may compare
them to their phantom selves.  Special decorations, which have always made the
affair a success, are to be more elaborate this year than ever before.

     Turkey Day was observed here this week with all the pomp and good
feeling and with an air of good fellowship among the photoplayers of the
colony...Many merry social parties marked the week, the most notable of which
was the photoplayers' ball at Venice.  J. Barney Sherry, our friend the Irish
Prince, and Miss Mabel Normand, our queen of the movies, led the grand march.
A following of picture players in full dress was on hand, as were a thousand
actors and other movie people in costume and disguise.  The night was one of
mardi gras, and for the first time in the history of the land Thanksgiving
eve was celebrated.  The same night, Fred Kley, business manager of the Lasky
studio, issued the toasts at the good fellowship dinner at the club.  His
party adjourned later to the Venice ball and took part in the grand march.
One of the best dinners ever was this week's, a large number of members being

night fellowship dinner joy wagon broke all speed and attendance records this
week.  It seemed as if the very hub had turned out in a body to attend the big
event when the new president of the club took hold.  Never had so many members
been present, and a great time was had by all.  Afterwards many more, who
could not be accommodated at dinner, returned and a general get-acquainted
session started.  The evening was a joyous one, no business interfering with
the merry affair, although most everyone expressed their interest in the
coming ball in February.

     Whether it is interest in the coming big 1915 ball, or whether it is
just an added impetus from new companies coming west, or just a natural
livening of things here, the Photoplayers' Club is a busy place.  This week
Henry Balboa Walthall was the master of ceremonies, and a crowd equal to the
one of last week was present to hear him.  Every kind of fun and
entertainment was offered the screen men; old timers met and new friends were
made, the evening being a record-breaker for floating attendance.  Many man
came up to the club while en route to the Static ball on the same evening.
[The Static Club ball was held on January 10, 1915.  The Static Club was the
organization of cameramen which would eventually evolve into the American

     Saturday evening members of the Photoplayers' Club enjoyed a Dutch
dinner and entertainment at the Los Angeles Athletic Club as guests of the
entertainment committee, of which Leo P. Bergin is chairman.  He attended the
fellowship dinner Wednesday evening and formally invited the boys to attend
the get-acquainted affair.  The film fellows reported a jolly good time.

     The Photoplayers' club has been put through a whirlwind and shaken up
and cleaned up.  A force of artificers are busily engaged in remodeling the
second floor.  The bar is being taken out and a library put in with a card
room just off it.  The bar goes to the main floor, where the grill and stein
room will be kept open all the time.  This merge was made only after being
agitated for by Douglas Gerrard, a member of the board of control.  Manager
Frank Cavender succeeds William Reid.  Business has increased so much that a
bookkeeper has been added to the employee list.

     Just a last word.  Douglas Gerrard, in charge of the boxes for the
coming Photoplayers' ball said that the whole fifty-six compartments had been
sold; thus the outlook for the big affair shows that it will be a real world
beater.

     It appeared as if every prominent star and player of California's famed
motion picture colonies attended the grand ball of the Photoplayers' Club at
Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Saturday evening, Feb. 13. Miss Mary Pickford
presided as the reigning star of the evening and led the grand march with
Dell Henderson, president of the club.
     All matters of state, screens and pictures were forgotten for the
evening. The stars and players had ceased to be. They simply acted natural,
and were a magnificent showing of highly cultivated, talented men and women.
Notable society leaders of Southern California and visitors from all parts of
the world now sojourning in California were among those present, while
dignitaries of the financial and commercial world, film magnates, producers,
cinematographers, writers and representative newspaper men added to the
cosmopolitan air of the gathering.
     Seated in the rear of the gaily decorated boxes occupied by the people
of the "movies" were several thousand invited guests who participated in the
dancing and social greetings of the ball, each meeting his or her favorite of
the screen and interchanging confidences that bring warm-blood people into
equal appreciation of each other.
     Promptly at 10 o'clock the megaphone announcer called the grand march
and the real ball festivities began, with Miss Pickford and Mr. Henderson in
the lead, responding to the strains of martial music by the orchestra.
     They were followed by William D. Taylor, first vice-president of the
club, and Cleo Madison; Henry B. Walthall, second vice-president, and Ruth
Roland; Wallace Reid, secretary and treasurer, and Dorothy Davenport; George
Seigmann and Dorothy Gish; Carlyle Blackwell and Mabel Normand; Douglas

     Cuisine unexcelled!  Entertainment de luxe!  Goodfellowship unbounded!
That is what William D. Taylor, Carlyle Blackwell's director, gave the
regular fellows at the dinner Wednesday evening.  As a toastmaster "Bill" is
a grand man, and the event will go down in club history as one of the big
times of the season.

     Ha, ha, hat!  Wow!  Lookout, fellers, here comes the band!  And so it
came to pass that another good time was written on the Photoplayers' history
book, that of Roscoe Arbuckle, one oversized comedian from the Keystone.  He
was a toastmaster royal, and every member present pronounced the dinner a
grand success.

     ...[On March 24, 1915] the Photoplayers held their regular weekly
fellowship dinner at their fine clubhouse in South Hill street.
     Eugene Pallette was director-in-chief, and he started the ball rolling
with the first course of the excellent turkey dinner cooked in the kitchen of
the club.  President Dell Henderson and Vice-President William Taylor were on
each side of the toastmaster.  The event of the evening was the address by Al
Jennings, the man with a past, who claimed the right to a future--and he
proved his contention by winning it.  It will be recalled that Mr. Jennings
recently appeared before the camera in "Beating Back," the story of which was
based on his own life.  In his talk Mr. Jennings recounted some of the events
of his career.  He did not spare himself--neither did he spare others.
     There can be no gainsaying the fact that Al Jennings is a remarkable
man.  He is a speaker of power.  He has keen wit, a delivery that is all the
more impressive by its straightforwardness, its frankness and its direct
appeal to the hearer's sense of justice.  His voice is raised just so high as
may reach the last auditor.  It is well modulated.  The former "lifer" is the
antithesis of the bad man as we are taught by those fiction writers and stage
producers to believe him.  He is short of stature and even of temper.  He is
magnetic, a natural leader.  Not a bit of the drama in the story he unfolded
was lost on the players and directors who with rapt attention followed him--
from his birth in a fence corner in Virginia as his mother was fleeing from
an invading army; how at fourteen years of age he was a fully grown man and
knew no law but the blue barrel of a "forty-five."  Mr. Jennings knows his
Bible and uses its parables, and he knows, too, how most effectively to use
them.
     The speaker was given an ovation when he finished.  Others who were
heard from in song or story or talk were Dick Cummings, Charles Mailes,
Hirshall Mayall, Chet Withey, Harry Gribben, Al Filson, Dick Willis, John
Sheehan, Elmer Redmond, Mr. Pallette, the father of the toastmaster; Jack
Dillon and Eddie Dillon.
     The weekly dinner of the Photoplayers has been one of the features of
the club since its organization.

     Herbert Rawlinson, toastmaster last Wednesday night at the club,
introduced "a man who is soon to become a groom."  The man got up and said a
few words and we recognized Allan Dwan, who is to be wedded to Miss Pauline
Bush, formerly his leading lady at the Universal.  Everyone wished the F. P.
[Famous Players] director the best in the world, and here is another wish for
eternal happiness.

     On Saturday night the Photoplayers, Inc., quietly passed away and is now
in complete and resposeful oblivion.  Everything belonging to the club has
been put in storage.  The closing of the promising club was made because of
the failure of a majority of the members to pay their dues.  Of late much
money had been lost each week, and so it decided "to close while closing was
good," i.e., to stop the bills and pay those due while there was money on the
hand.
     Wednesday night Eddie Dillon was to have been toastmaster, so the good
members decided to hold a dinner at a local cafe, and to talk over the
affair.  The dinner was more of a success than any held before.  The
officials say that the club ought to be reorganized within a month or so.

[Although the Photoplayers Club was now officially dead, there were a few
more social gatherings held by ex-members, and a few meager attempts at
revival.]
                                                                 June 5, 1915
                                                         MOVING PICTURE WORLD
     On the evening of Thursday, May 13, many of the men who were of the
membership of the late Photoplayers' Club assembled at one of the downtown
restaurants [Levy's Cafe] for dinner.  The coming of the actors had been
announced, and as a result there was a crush and a great many were turned
away.  Later there was an impromptu entertainment, at which Henry Walthall
acted as master of ceremonies.  Charles Chaplin led the orchestra for two
numbers.  The was laughter as he began, but very shortly it was discovered he
really was leading; there was hearty applause for him.  The other
entertainers were Charles Murray, Truly Shattuck, Roscoe Arbuckle, Martha
Golding, Porter Strong, Ruth Roland, Julian Eltinge, Victor Moore, Harry
Gribon, Leo White and Polly Moran.  It was a great night.
       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                                                                July 10, 1915
                                                         MOVING PICTURE WORLD
     ...It was on May thirteenth last that at the restaurant in question
there was a stated gathering of photoplayers.  For several days previously a
card near the entrance had announced the coming event.  Seven o'clock on the
evening in question found two long tables in the center of the room.  All
other tables were filled or engaged, and a goodly number waited an
opportunity to be accommodated.  Many had taken the precaution to reserve
places, anticipating the demand.  Some of the prominent players and directors
took their regular chairs.
     It was nearly 8 o'clock when the long table began to fill.  There was
handclapping for Henry Walthall, "the little Colonel," when he took his seat.
Some of those seen about the room--and no attempt was made to compile a list
--were Frank Bushman, just arrived in Los Angeles, delighted with the town
and mighty glad to see a man from the east; Fred Balshofer, Raymond
Hitchcock, Mack Sennett, Charles Arling, Hobart Henley, three weeks out from
New York having been transferred by President Laemmle at his own request to
the Western Universal from the Eastern; Travers Vale, Louise Vale, Franklin
Ritchie, Lottie Pickford, and more than a hundred others...
     There were cheers when Mr. Walthall arrayed in his "little colonel"
flowing tie, arose at the head of the tables, just under the orchestra
platform.  "I have the very great pleasure and the honor," he said in that
fine voice of his, "to announce that our fellow artist and photoplayer,
Charles Chaplin, will now lead the orchestra."
     Mr. Chaplin made humorous reference to the large sum one of the papers
had announced as having been offered him.  "You must know, of course, I have
been working very hard today," he said.  "I have taken a fall and hurt my
elbow."  The comedian removed his coat and immediately replaced it.  He faced
the musicians and shook at them a mane that would have done credit to the
leader of the Royal Italian Band.  Roars of laughter followed the gymnastic
efforts of the little funmaker.  Suddenly it dawned on the big party that
what it had construed as comedy was as a matter of fact straight hard work.
Chaplin really was leading; the musicians were with him to a fraction of a
second.  The body swayed, the masses of black hair flowed from side to side;
the most temperamental of Latin bandmasters apparently had in his bag of
tricks nothing Chaplin didn't expose.  Stirring indeed was the execution of
Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever"' and absorbingly interesting it was, too,
to watch the serious, even stern, faces of the musicians.  There was a hush
as Chaplin's arms rested at the cutting of the last note; then came a roar of
applause testifying the admiration of the comedian's confreres and of the
general public as well.  An encore followed.  Then the situation changed from
drama to comedy, and there were many laughs.
     "I am not going to introduce but to announce Truly Shattuck," said Mr.
Walthall.  The old-time player put her hands upon the toastmaster's face and
the diners cheered.  Then followed "Gone are the days," and nearly every one
sang the chorus with Miss Shattuck.  When there were calls for more the
singer beckoned to Charles Murray, and Mr. Murray came forward.  He is always
at home in this house; frequently he has been known from his place at the
table down front to assist the orchestra leader.  The two sang in fine voice
that which so often they have sung together on the stage--"Alma, where do you
live?"
     Martha Golding gave a recitation in French patois and Roscoe Arbuckle
told two stories.  Harry Gribon sang, so, too, did Polly Moran.  Leo White
recited.  Hal Williams sang "Tipperary."  Tom Mix, who in the Rodeo had been
jumped on by a horse and badly hurt, was called up so that the party could
cheer him.  Porter Strong in a dance with an Oriental touch made a lot of
fun.
     Charlie Murray gave a recitation in blank verse; it was not a
recitation, either; it was more of a speech.  He told of the woes of a comic,
he praised Charlie Chaplin and took off his hat to him.  He spoke of Julian
Eltinge and of the dear old Burbank days.  He said there were many familiar
faces out in front of him and that he could go down the line.  For once Mr.
Murray was serious, but he carried the party with him all the time.
     "Our distinguished guest, Julian Eltinge," announced Mr. Walthall, and
the ensuing applause was hearty.  "I am very grateful to be here," said the
well-known impersonator.  "I just came out on a little vacation.  Now I am
not going to apologize for my voice but for my throat."  In the splendid
singing of "The Crinoline Girl" that followed there seemed to be no occasion
for apologizing for either.  Mr. Eltinge got his full mead of hearty praise.
     Ruth Roland was given a reception that indicated in unmistakable manner
the affection her fellow players bear her.  She sang sweetly and simply "Wrap
me in a bundle and take me home with you."  The screen boys and girls would
not let her go, so she sang "California and You," and the diners helped her
with the chorus.  This is a good place to say that Miss Roland is a
California girl--a San Franciscan.  Dell Henderson, the last president of the
Photoplayers' Club, responded to the call of the toastmaster by giving a
recitation--and doing it well.
     One of the hits of the night was Victor Moore.  After an introductory
talk Mr. Moore told the story of the Broadway newsboy--"Partners."  None of
the pathos of the poem was lost in its telling.  The speaker did not have to
raise his voice; absolute silence was provided for him, or rather the art of
the actor and the heart appeal of the simple tale secured it for him.  "Over
three thousand miles from here there is a little girl to whom I always drink
every night when I am away from home," said Mr. Moore, as he concluded the
story of the "newsy."  "I'd dearly like to have you join me in drinking
tonight to the best of girls, the best of pals--my wife."  Everybody joined
Mr. Moore.  It may have been due to the influence of the story and perhaps it
may have been partly owing to appreciation of the fine sentiment behind the
toast or even again it might have been in a measure due to the reversion of
thoughts to homes and pals back East by many of the expatriates, but there
were more dry glasses than there were dry eyes.
     And the foregoing is just a part of the story of one night among the
photoplayers of the West Coast.

     Thursday night of this week the old standpatters from the Photoplayers
club gathered together for an evening of frivolity at a downtown cafe where
they go to most of the time.  Two weeks ago there was a lively time and it
was eclipsed this week.  Carlyle Blackwell was at the helm and the people he
called on were the best in the business.
     Harry McCoy was the first filmer up, and he led out with the national
song, leading the big orchestra.  Rena Rogers was next, followed by Jerry
Gerrard, Dick Smith, Myrtle Stedman, William Rock, Julian Eltinge, Ruth
Roland, Raymond Hitchcock, who gave the evening the proper comedy climax.  He
produced a Keystone scene with Dell Henderson directing.  The big director of
course ordered a retake, much to the surprise and approval of the vast
throng.  Vast throng being a gathering of film admirers, who had heard of the
dinner.  The place was practically all reserved by outsiders, although many
prominent canvas people were at side tables.  Photoplayers only were allowed
at the two long tables.
