scandals.  This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life;
(b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor
murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood
silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given
toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it
for accuracy.

                 James Bean's Theory Regarding Taylor's Killer

Most of the detectives involved in the investigation of the Taylor case
thought the killer was either Sands or Shelby (or someone acting for Shelby,
like Stockdale).  One detective with a completely different viewpoint was
James F. Bean, who gave the following interview on the 25th anniversary of
Taylor's murder.

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

                                                             February 1, 1947
                                                   LOS ANGELES HERALD-EXPRESS
     ...An old-time police detective, James F. Bean, long since retired,
worked on the case painstakingly.  He had the most prosaic theory of them all
as to how Taylor met death.  Because it was prosaic, it never received much
publicity.  He said:
     "I believe and always will believe that a burglar killed Taylor.
He was known as the 'Dinner Time Thief' because he always stole between
5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., when residents of the Westlake district were out
eating.  I checked the police records, which disclosed that this thief had
committed about 25 burglaries in the area surrounding the Taylor home during
the year prior to the director's slaying.
     "Immediately after the murder of Taylor this burglar ceased operating.
     "...Taylor was a courageous man.  His friends testified to that.
I reasoned at the time that burglar, probably aware that Taylor lived alone,
was watching the house.  He saw the director and Miss Normand walk out to her
car.  He figured they were going to dinner.  It was his custom to wait until
victims left their homes and then quickly go in and loot them.  I reasoned
that the prowler, intent on a fast clean-up, saw Taylor and Miss Normand
leave, then he entered...  He was busy looting when Taylor came back and
confronted him.
     "In my mind's eye, I can see the burglar and Taylor facing each other,
the thief telling the director to hold up his hands and sit down.
Contemptuously and foolhardedly, I can see Taylor grab the small, strait
backed chair with the intention of hitting the intruder over the head with
it.  The chair came aloft and as Taylor's body half turned to deliver the
blow, the thief stepped back and fired...  Naturally, Taylor died instantly.
     "In my opinion, the Taylor murder will never be solved unless the guilty
person confesses on his or her deathbed, an unlikely prospect, but I still
believe that a prowler fired the fatal shot and my guess is as good as
anyone's."

                   Rumors, "Solutions," and Strange Reports
                                       

The following is a selection of rumors and strange reports pertaining to the
Taylor case.

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     The 1951 movie "The Hollywood Story" was very loosely based on the
Taylor murder case.  Actor Elmo Lincoln reportedly confided to a visitor to
the movie set that actor Art Acord was the person who had really killed
Taylor.

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     Noted film historian DeWitt Bodeen researched the Taylor case and
planned a nonfiction book on it, but it was never published.  Instead, Bodeen
turned his research into a thinly-veiled fictionalization of the Taylor case,
THIRTEEN CASTLE WALK (Pyramid Books, 1975).  The solution presented in that
book is as follows:  Supposedly, Taylor had a homosexual relationship with
Jack Pickford, and Taylor infected Jack Pickford with syphilis.  Jack
Pickford in turn infected his wife Olive Thomas, who committed suicide after
learning she had contracted the disease.  Jack Pickford blamed Taylor for
having been the cause of his wife's suicide, and murdered Taylor in revenge.

                            Taylor Murder Has Echo
                                       
     Echoes of the William Desmond Taylor murder case of 1922 yesterday
clamored for the attention of officers in the investigation into the
mysterious slaying of Earl Boruff, 41-year-old Long Beach detective, who was
found dying, fatally wounded by his own revolver, on the outskirts of Long
Beach early on the morning of the 18th inst.
     This new phase of the Boruff case was revealed in a confidential report
of Long Beach police officers who made the preliminary investigation of the
case, turned over yesterday to Capt. William J. Bright, chief of Sheriff
Traeger's homicide investigation detail.
     Boruff, the report states, a few months ago confided to a friend that he
knew more about the William Desmond Taylor murder case than any other person
in Southern California, and would have solved it if he had not been removed
from the inquiry and ordered to "lay off."  At the time he was investigating
the Taylor case, Boruff was working for the Department of Justice, according
to officers.
     The detective further stated that should the identity of Taylor's
slayers become known and the case cleared up, it would rock the nation from
San Francisco to Washington, D.C.
     The conversation in which Boruff related these intimations occurred on
or about June 5, last, according to the friend who gave the information to
Long Beach officers.
     Investigators also have found that Boruff, about two weeks before he was
killed, expressed fear for his life but never mentioned who his enemies were.
At that time he borrowed a revolver and for the first time in many months
carried the weapon with him at all times.
     When he was found dying a few feet from his coupe on East Anaheim
street, his gun was lying by his side with three exploded shells in the
chambers.  Later investigators found the man's pocketbook beneath a bridge
one mile away, and this discovery caused the suicide theory to be discarded
completely.

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     One of the detectives who investigated the Taylor murder right from the
start was Jesse Winn.  He wrote about the case in 1937, and stated:  "Only a
few months ago, a war veteran came to the office of District Attorney Fitts
with what he considered irrefutable proof that Taylor had not been killed at
all!  The body found in his apartment and recognized by scores of men and
women, this man insisted, was really that of Taylor's brother--the director
having staged his own "murder" in order to disappear from society forever."
[FRONT PAGE DETECTIVE, June 1937].

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     In January 1930, three separate individuals made statements implicating
Mabel Normand in Taylor's murder:  (1) Henry Peavey, Taylor's ex-servant,
(2) Otis Heffner, ex-convict, and (3) Vincent Clark, editor of the
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.  Heffner's statement was totally discredited (see
TAYLOROLOGY 50).  Peavey's statement indicated that an argument had taken
place between Taylor and Normand during their last visit, and that a
telephone call to Taylor's home at 7:30 had gone unanswered (see TAYLOROLOGY
69).  Clark's statement was never made public, but his wire to Fitts stated:
     "Information obtained by me and given to the district attorney's office
December 19, 1922, checks in detail with recent disclosures carried in press
relating to Taylor murder case.  My statement should be on file.  Have
acknowledgment receipt in my possession signed by Robert F. Herron,
Woolwine's private secretary.  Can repeat statement if needed.  If no more
assistance needed from me will release story to press."
     Herron was still a member of Fitts' staff and remembered taking a
statement from Clark, but it could not be located.  After a conference with
the Philadelphia district attorney, Clark announced that he would make no
further statement except to an agent of Fitts, and nothing further was
mentioned in public regarding the contents of Clark's statement.

     On March 24, 1923, the cover of MOVIE WEEKLY asked, "Did Movie Ku Klux
Kill Wm. D. Taylor?"  Inside, the article by T. Howard Kelly speculated that
the Ku Klux Klan, or some similar secret organization, may have been
responsible for the murders of William D. Taylor and actress Fritzie Mann.
A subsequent article appeared in the May 5, 1923 issue of MOVIE WEEKLY:
"Movie Weekly Writer is Threatened by Ku Klux Klan."  Writer T. Howard Kelly
revealed that after the publication of the first article he received two
phone calls and an anonymous letter.  The first phone call was a man's voice,
stating: "Are you going to keep your mouth shut about the K. K. K. in the
movies?  If not you go the way of William Desmond Taylor and Fritzie Mann."
The second call was from a woman who asked, "Are you through suggesting that
the Ku Klux Klan is at work in the movies?"  Kelly replied, "I am not."  The
woman then stated, "Then you can blame yourself for whatever happens to you,"
and hung up.  The anonymous letter was signed "K.K.K." and stated verbatim:
"There is many of that movie actors and actresses they will go to meet Mr.
William Desmond Taylor and Fritzie Mann if they don't change the system of
them live.  But if you don't keep your mouth enclose and leave the Klan alone
you'll be sorry.  Now is up to you..." [sic]

                                                            February 16, 1922
                                                          LOS ANGELES EXPRESS
     The burning love of a film idol for his wife, which first drove him into
frenzies of despair and finally to murder, was whispered about the Hall of
Records today as the real solution of the mystery surrounding the death of
William D. Taylor.
     And on the strength of this story a state-wide search has been
instituted for the actor, formerly associated with one of the largest film
producing organizations in Southern California, and for his wife.  The woman
is said by the authorities to still be in the vicinity of Los Angeles.  The
man, it is feared, has fled.
     According to information in the hands of the authorities, the man in
question was called to the East in connection with the production of a
picture about five months ago.  He was absent for two months.  During that
period, it is asserted, his wife, who also acts before the camera, was seen
several times with Taylor.
     Whether or not this man, consumed by the fires of jealousy, spied upon
his wife and, believing her to be infatuated with Taylor, killed him, is not
publicly known.  Investigators decline to discuss the case, but it is
indicated that the details of the situation are in their possession and they
are of sufficient importance to warrant a widespread investigation.

                                                            February 17, 1922
                                                           LOS ANGELES RECORD
     The theory that Taylor was slain for money was revived Friday when Mrs.
J. M. Berger, income tax expert, reported that the film director had a large
roll of bills in his possession when she talked to him at 4 o'clock on the
afternoon of the day he was murdered.  W. T. Hammond, cashier at the First
National Bank, where Taylor kept his accounts, said that the director made no
deposit that day.
     When found murdered Taylor had a flat wad of bills, amounting to $70 in
a pocket.  Mrs. Berger thinks the roll she saw was much larger than this.
     Following her statement Friday the theory was advanced that Taylor was
killed by a blackmailer after he had given the man the roll of bills.  After
the crime the slayer could have departed hastily, taking with him the money
he received from Taylor, but not disturbing the money and jewelry on his
person.

     Los Angeles, Feb. 24--..A new Tong war is brooding in Ferguson Alley,
this city's Chinatown, as the result of the murder of William Desmond Taylor,
the Hollywood film director so mysteriously shot down in his bungalow the
night of February 1 just after Mabel Normand, his favorite screen beauty, had
bidden him good-by.
     Lim Kee, one of the alley's wealthiest merchants, has been killed,
riddled with bullets fired by Tong men, on the very eve of his marriage to a
Chinatown belle.  Chinatown detectives who understand something of the dark
and strange ways of Oriental circles hereabout say that Kee was credited with
knowing too much about the murder of Taylor.  He was a recognized enemy of
another Chinaman now thought to be implicated in the murder.

                                                         LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
     ...The other development, revealed by District Attorney Buron Fitts and
his aides, was the commencement of a detailed search for a woman, who, a year
ago, attempted to supply authorities with highly important information
concerning the slaying of the noted film director, but, who it was said, was
rebuffed because officials "weren't interested" in the case at the time.
     The woman, it was revealed, approached Capt. Jack Southard of the
District Attorney's office with information that she had overhead a
declaration at a dinner party, wherein one of the persons closely acquainted
with Taylor at the time of his mysterious death allegedly said, in effect,
"I took care of Taylor and I'll take care of anyone else who tries to
interfere with my affairs as he did."
     Southard introduced the woman to a superior official, but the latter
declared there was no investigation pending, and that he did not care to
pursue the new lead.

     William D. Taylor, producer of Favorite Players' pictures and who is
busy preparing for the new five-reel photoplay adapted from the novel,
"Mr. Grex of Monte Carlo," by E. Phillips Oppenheim came near to being
knocked out on Sunday.  Taylor, with the property man and scene painter was
looking through some sets, and a fourteen foot plank became loose and hit
Taylor on the head.  He says he had no idea he possessed such a hard skull
and beyond a bad headache he suffered little injury.  The property man and
scene painter were more frightened than Taylor was hurt they aver.

                                                     EXHIBITOR'S TRADE REVIEW
     With the statement of a prominent Los Angeles eye specialist that
William D. Taylor, the noted director, may have to retire from studio
activity because of deterioration of vision from ultra-violet ray action, a
menace to film workers far more dangerous than klieg-eyes, is disclosed.
     Other prominent individuals working before and behind the motion camera
may be forced to retire if the pigment of the eyes in each case is
susceptible to the ghastly rays of the mercury-vapor lamps now used in many
studios. The disorder evidences itself in a dull throbbing of the eye after a
day's work under these lights, actors say.
     With the development and extensive use of "back lighting" the menace
extends to those outside the camera range as well as those directly under the
lights. Some eyes are so constituted that the action of the ultra-violet rays
is not fatal to the pigment, surgeons state.
     In other cases, permanent impairment of vision may result.
     William D. Taylor, who has achieved the doubtful distinction of being
first to suffer the yet unnamed disorder, is working on future stories in
order to rest his eyes from the mercury lights. Because of the switch in
plans, Cosmo Hamilton's original screen story will not be filmed next, as
previously announced.

                  Why Margaret Gibson Changed her Screen Name

     From 1912 to 1917 Margaret Gibson acted in many films, building her
reputation on screen and within the movie industry.  Then, in 1918, she
quietly changed her screen name to Patricia Palmer, and the fan magazines
never hinted that Patricia Palmer and Margaret Gibson were the same person.
So why the name change?  There certainly were other instances of actresses
changing their screen names, but this generally occurred when the first
career was going nowhere.  Margaret Gibson, on the other hand, had been in
the hit movie "The Coward."  Why start over as someone else?  The answer can
be deduced from the following clippings; once this incident became public,
she clearly had no choice:  Given the moral climate of the time, if she
wished to continue working before the movie camera, she would have to change
her identity and start over.  So she did, and her "Patricia Palmer" career
was much more subdued, with no interviews appearing in fan magazines.  [Many
thanks to Richard Rosenberg for providing the following clippings.  If anyone
will provide other clippings with additional information pertaining to this
incident, we will reprint them also.]

                  Margaret Gibson, Picture Actress, Arrested

     Margaret Gibson, moving picture comedy star, was arrested late yesterday
afternoon and lodged in the City Jail following a raid conducted by Officers
Trebilcock and Douglas and Federal Agent Putnam upon two houses in Commercial
Street.
     Miss Gibson was taken into custody at No. 432 1/2 Commercial Street,
where eleven others also were placed under arrest.  They gave the names of
Ruth Slauson, Pearl Young, Ralph Rodriguez, Robert Rodriguez, F. Costillo, S.
Eshikawa, M. T. Hashimoto, C. Ito, T. Soneda and I. Kanba.  Ralph Rodriguez
was charged with a felony, the charges against him being suspicion of keeping
his wife in a disorderly house, and the others were booked on charges of
vagrancy and violation of the rooming-house ordinance.
     The arrest and charges against Miss Gibson grow out of her presence in a
place the officers believed to be a house of ill fame.  According to the
police a young woman closely answering the film star's description was known
to enter the place regularly in the past few days.
     Miss Gibson vehemently denied the charges and called her arrest
ridiculous.  According to her story, she met Pearl Young, whom she knew for
some time and with whom she had worked in pictures, and was invited to the
house to see some "local color" and taste some Spanish dishes.  She was in
the room with Miss Young and Mrs. Rodriguez when the police broke into the
house and placed them under arrest, she declared.  After spending two hours
in the City Jail, Miss Gibson was released on $250 bail.
     The police are puzzled by the conflicting details and stories told by
the different prisoners taken in the raid, and further investigation into the
affair will be made, they say.
     The second raid was made on a house at No. 444 1/2 Commercial Street,
where the prisoners, four of them men, were taken.  Charges of vagrancy,
rooming-house ordinance violation, and possession of opium were made against
them.

                  Former Film Star will be Tried as a Vagrant

     Margaret Gibson, former motion-picture star, who was arrested last
Saturday afternoon in a raid on an alleged house of ill fame at No. 432 1/2
Commercial Street by Officers Trebilcock and Douglas, was yesterday arraigned
before Police Judge White on a charge of lewdness.  Her case was set for
trial October 12.  Miss Gibson pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial.
She is at liberty on $250 bail.
     She and three other women were arrested Saturday evening after two
houses--one at No. 442 1/2 Commercial Street and the other at No. 432 1/2--
had been under surveillance for several days.  According to the police, no
less than seventy-one Japanese entered the two buildings in three hours
Saturday afternoon a week ago.
     Joe Peppa, said to be an opium smuggler and well known to the police,
was arrested yesterday and taken before Police Judge White by Officers
Trebilcock and Douglas.  He was remanded to jail in default of $250 bail.
He also is charged with lewdness, and the police suspect him of having some
connection with Miss Gibson's case.  He will be tried October 27.
     S. Echikima, M. T. Hashimoto, T. Sondad and K. Fugi, Japanese, arrested
in the Commercial Street raid, pleaded guilty to resorting to a house of ill
fame and were fined $25 each by Justice White yesterday.
     Miss Pearl Young and Miss Ruth Slauson, also arrested in the raid, were
held for trial before Police Judge Chesebro in the women's court.  Miss Young
will be tried September 30 and Miss Slauson September 29.
     Lola Rieves, also arrested in the raid, was charged with conducting a
disorderly house.  She pleaded not guilty and asked for a jury trial, which
will be given her September 25.  Robert Rodriguez, charged with vagrancy,
will be tried September 29, as will E. Nodena and Manuel Vega, similarly
charged.
     Complaints charging Ralph and Frank Rodriguez with keeping their wives
in disorderly houses probably will be sworn to by the arresting officers
today.

                                                           LOS ANGELES HERALD
     The costume worn by Miss Margaret Gibson, a pretty actress, when she was
found in a house on Commercial Street during a police raid, was depicted with
some detail today, when the case was heard before a jury of seven women and
five men in Judge Chesbro's court.
     In addition to the seven women on the jury, Miss Gibson faced another of
her own sex in the person of Miss Margaret Gardner, the prosecuting attorney.
     Society people and motion picture actors, mingled with the residents of
the Commercial Street district in the court room.
     Miss Gibson declares she was in the house to obtain "atmosphere" for a
picture in which she is about to appear.  The police charge against her at
the time of the raid was vagrancy, and they attempted today to prove that she
was in a place of disorderly repute.
     As to the costume, it was asserted that Miss Gibson was clad principally
in a kimona and that she wore shoes and socks, not stockings.
     Miss Gibson gave her age as 22, but she has the appearance of a girl of
16.
     She showed no emotion and little interest in court today while she was
accused of having been found with five Japanese and white men in the
Commercial Street house.
     Behind her sat her mother, interestedly following every detail of the
prosecution.
     Special Officer Siebentree was first called to the witness stand.  He
told of having gone to the Commercial Street rooming house August 25.  While
there he declared he saw Miss Gibson dressed only in a kimona, made apron
fashion, and wearing socks and shoes.  He declared there were five Japanese,
two other white women and several white men in the room.
     When Miss Gibson was taken in custody Siebentree declared she asked time
to change her clothes.
     The greatest part of the trial was given over to lengthy arguments
between Miss Margaret Gardner, the prosecutor, and the counsel for the
defense.
     At one instance of an objection to the introduction of testimony, Miss
Gardener jumped to her feet and exclaimed: "If you are slurring my
professional honor, you can retract at once."  Only interference on the part
of Judge Cheseboro prevented a length altercation.
     Police Officer Douglas was the only other witness called during the
forenoon.  He told of having gone to the rooming house.  The jury was
dismissed until 2:15 o'clock in the afternoon, when the case was again called
and again the courtroom was crowded.
     The jury sworn in was comprised of Mildred A. Bengel, Richard A.
Collins, Emma Boyd, Alma E. Dewey, W. E. Dunham, Lena Filtner, Ann B.
Stevension, William J. Watson, J. H. Hayes, Crista L. Molten, Sallie D.
Richards and Conrad Ccherer.

                          Woman Lawyer Nettles Court

     [A portion of this clipping was torn at one edge; possible missing words
are indicated by braces.]
     The climax in the trial of Margaret Gibson, charged with immoral
conduct, came late yesterday afternoon, when Police Judge Chesebro pointed
his finger at Margaret Gardner, deputy city prosecutor, and exclaimed:
     "Miss Gardner, if you don't sit down immediately and proceed with the
cross-examination of the witness I shall fine you for contempt of court!"
     The young woman stood firm and resolute, with her hands on her hips, for
a breathless twenty seconds, and then she dropped into her chair.  The judge
issued his ultimatum after having cautioned Miss Gardner attempts to
establish the charge that No. 432 1/2 Commercial Street is a house of ill-
repute, and after having warned her to not stand and smile at him.
     A surprise was thrown into the defense when the prosecuting attorney
introduced as a witness Miss Ruth Slauson, whom Police Judge White had
sentenced to ninety days in jail for having frequented the house in which
Miss Gibson was arrested.  When Miss Slauson took the stand, petite and
fearful, she had considerable trouble in finding her voice.  She broke down
and wept so copiously that she was excused from the stand after Frank
Dominguez had severely arraigned her in an effort to impeach her testimony.
He succeeded in getting her to admit that she testified against herself and
Miss Gibson yesterday in spite of the fact that at her own trial she had
said, he alleged, that she never had committed an immoral act at the house in
question and didn't know of anybody who had.
     Yesterday, however, she said she saw Miss Gibson at the Commercial
Street address on August 25.  This is a part of her story:
     "I met Miss Gibson in the hall of the rooming-house at No. 432 1/2
Commercial Street while I was working there.  We sat on chairs in the hall.
Japanese men entered the hall.  They would either tap us on the shoulder or
motion to us, and we would accompany them to a room.  The afternoon I refer
to I sat in the hall about fifteen minutes and then went to a room.  Miss
Gibson [was] there about half an hour and [then] went to a room.  In each
c[ase she] went with Japanese men.  I re[mained] in my room from five to
fifteen minutes, but I can't say how long [Miss] Gibson remained in a room
w[ith each] Japanese man, because we di[d not] go in and come out at the
[same] time."
     Attorney Dominguez attempted to impeach the testimony of Officer E.
Trebilcock.  The latter said that on the night of the raid he saw Margaret
Gibson in the left hall, wearing a loose house apron, the top of which was
quite low and the bottom of which dropped scarcely below her knees.  He said
she told Officer Allison she was a picture star seeking local color, and that
she begged to be turned loose because she had been there only that one time.
He said she reached over and tried to kiss Allison.  Officer Trebilcock said,
that Miss Gibson came over and also tried to kiss him, while the landlord,
Pearl Young, Ruth Slauson and others were in the room, and that he told her
to go away and not attempt to "love him up."
     L. E. Larronde, who occupied the house at No. 448 Commercial Street
believed he had seen Miss Gibson enter the house ten or fifteen different
times.
     Miss Gibson appeared in the courtroom yesterday with her mother and a
young man of about her own age.  During intermissions she was the center of a
bevy of young women.  The trial is largely attended.

                                                           LOS ANGELES HERALD
     Somebody stole a kiss from Miss Margaret Gibson when she was arrested in
a Commercial Street rooming house, according to testimony today at the trial
of Miss Gibson, a bewitching actress, who is technically charged with
vagrancy.
     Miss Gibson says the man who purloined the dainty osculation was a
police officer.
     In addition she says the officer told her she was "a very pretty girl."
     The story of the kiss was told when Miss Gibson went on the stand in
Judge Chesebro's court, and with flashing eyes denied the statements of
various witnesses for the prosecution that she was a visitor at the
Commercial Street house for the purpose of receiving attentions from men.
     The actress defiantly denied that she had been the object of ardent
courtship by Japanese, as was testified by Miss Ruth Slauson, who also was
arrested in the raid.
     Gowned in a dark green suit, her hair forming a halo beneath a black
hat, the actress today told of her life at the different studios and of how
she came to be in the rooming house on Commercial Street.
     "Since I was twelve years old," she said, "I have been engaged in the
show business.  My father left my mother at that time and I have been her
only support since."
     Regarding the stolen kiss, Miss Gibson said Police Officer Allison
leaned over and kissed her while they were waiting for the police patrol,
after first remarking that she was an "unusually pretty girl to be found in
such a place."
     The little actress who gave her age as twenty-three but who looks like a
school girl, told of having first gone to the Commercial Street house.
     She declared a Spanish girl had taken her there to visit a Mr. and Mrs.
Rodriquez.  Then when she saw the character of the place she declared it
interested her and she went three more times to study it, hoping it would
help her in her film work.
     Under a severe cross-examination Miss Gibson held to her own.  She will
be recalled to the witness stand later and will again face Miss Margaret
Gardener, the prosecutor, who is endeavoring to convict her on the charge of
vagrancy.
     The statement that she wore a kimona when she was arrested indignantly
denied by Miss Gibson.
     Attorneys Dominguez, Cohen and Willis, who are representing Miss Gibson,
placed motion picture men and women on the stand this morning, including Mr.
and Mrs. Louis M. Morrison, all of whom testified to the good character of
the film actress...

                       Margaret Gibson found Not Guilty

     After deliberating fifteen minutes and taking two ballots, the jury in
the case of Miss Margaret Gibson, a motion-picture actress, charged with lewd
and immoral conduct, returned a verdict last evening of not guilty.
     The case went to the jury at 5 o'clock.  On the first ballot the jury
was ten to two for acquittal, but the next ballot was unanimously in favor of
the young woman's acquittal.  The case was tried before Police Judge Chesebro
in the women's court in Normal Hill Center.  It began Friday.
     Miss Gibson was arrested, with Pearl Young and Ruth Slauson, at a
rooming-house on Commercial Street in August.  All three of the young women
were charged with immoral conduct.  Miss Slauson was sentenced by Police
Judge White to serve ninety days in jail.  Miss Gibson demanded a jury trial
and was acquitted by the jury, and Miss Young has not yet had her trial.
     On the witness stand yesterday Miss Gibson stated that she is 23 years
of age.  She explained her presence at the rooming-house, which Japanese men
are alleged to patronize, by stating that she was getting local color in
order to play a lead in a vaudeville sketch.

     In 1923 Margaret Gibson was arrested again, on a much more serious
charge.

                            Screen Star Faces Judge

               Contractor Charges Patricia Palmer with Extortion
                          After Asserted Tijuana Trip

     Margaret Gibson, known as Patricia Palmer in the films, where she
attained prominence, was arraigned late yesterday before United States
Commissioner Stephen G. Long on a charge of violating Section 145 of the
Federal Criminal Code.  Bond was set at $2500, which she had failed to make
late yesterday, and the preliminary hearing announced for the 8th inst.
     The victim of the asserted extortion is George W. Lasher, electrical
contractor of Burbank, who told officers that he paid the young woman $1155
to avoid prosecution for asserted violation of the Mann Act.
     According to the Department of Justice Agent-in-Charge Wheeler, Miss
Palmer is connected with Don Osborne and Rose Putnam, convicted blackmailers,
who pleaded guilty last Tuesday in Cincinnati to extorting $10,000 from John
L. Bushnell, Ohio banker.
     Miss Palmer was arrested at her home, 2324 North Beachwood Drive,
yesterday morning by Detective Lieutenants Reed and Shafer, Investigator
Charles Reimer of the District Attorney's office, and Department of Justice
agents, who have been working on the investigation for several weeks.
     On last Saturday Miss Palmer was said to have married Arthur McGinnis at
Santa Ana.  She gained the limelight several years ago when, under the name
of Margaret Gibson, she was arrested in a raid on a Japanese rooming-house.
She was charged with vagrancy, but was acquitted of the charge in Police
Court.
     For the last several years Miss Palmer has played in numerous motion-
picture productions and has recently been working at the Lasky studio.  She
formerly played with Louise Glaum, and her picture, "Into the Light," was
exhibited in a Broadway Theater a few weeks ago.
     Last January Miss Palmer sold to Osborne, a house a 2575 Beachwood
Drive.  Many parties were given there with a large attendance of film
celebrities, said Wheeler.  In the latter part of January, said the officers,
Osborne called in Lasher to do electrical work, and on one occasion
introduced him to Miss Palmer.  A trip to Tijuana followed, Lasher declared,
at which time both he and Miss Palmer put up checks for $1000, making a
wager.  He said he realized something was wrong and went to Los Angeles,
where he stopped payment on the check.
     He was later approached by Osborne, he said, who told him it would be
best to pay the money.  He said Mrs. Ella Gibson, the girl's mother,
threatened him with the prosecution on the Mann Act, in taking the girl
across the international border to Tijuana.
     Her threats followed, he declared, and he paid her sums of $75, $800 and
$280 to escape prosecution.  This payment forms the basis of the government's
charge against the girl, as the Federal statutes declare that "whoever
extorts money on the threat of informing of a violation of the law shall be
subject to a fine of $2000 or a sentence of one year, or both."
     Miss Palmer was accompanied by her mother at the Federal Building.  Her
attorney, P. J. Cooney, stated that he would soon have her bail arranged.
     "It's a frame-up," said Miss Palmer, in answer to questions concerning
the affair.  On Osborne and other incidents she was silent.

                                                             November 3, 1923
                                                         LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
     Following the arrest yesterday of Margaret Gibson, pretty actress, known
in the films as Patricia Palmer, by Federal agents on a charge of extorting
$1155 from George W. Lasher, wealthy electrical contractor of Burbank, it was
learned last night that Miss Gibson is only one of many men and women who are
to be taken into custody here and elsewhere as the alleged members of a
blackmail ring which has mulcted prominent and wealthy men of more than
$3,000,000 during the past few years.
     Federal, county and local officers have been working on the case for
months and it is asserted that other warrants have been issued, but that the
names of the persons accused are being kept secret until they are
apprehended.
     Arresting officers declared she obtained the money by threatening to
prosecute Lasher on a "white slave" act charge.  She was taken into custody
at the home of her mother, Mrs. Ella Gibson, 2324 North Beechwood Drive.
     After being questioned by Lucien C. Wheeler of the Department of
Justice, and United States Attorney Joe Burke she was arraigned before United
States Commissioner Long.  He ordered her held under $2500 bond pending a
preliminary hearing on November 8.
     Her arrest was said by Federal agents to be an aftermath of the recent
expose of a Hollywood blackmailing ring headed by Dan Osborn and Rose Putnam.
This pair pleaded guilty and were sentenced in Federal court in Cincinnati
last week for extorting $10,000 from John L. Bushnell, Springfield, Ohio,
banker.
     The circumstances surrounding the alleged "shaking down" of the Burbank
business man have been under investigation since the early part of February,
it developed yesterday.  After the arrest in Cincinnati of the two
blackmailing suspects there, who had formerly lived in Hollywood in a house
rented from Miss Palmer, Agent Connelly was sent to Los Angeles by the
Department of Justice headquarters at Cincinnati to trace other activities
which were credited to the pair.
     Connelly worked the case here in collaboration with Agent Meehan of the
local Federal office, Police Lieutenants Reed and Shafer, and with Special
Investigator Charles Riemer of the District Attorney's office.  The actual
warrant of arrest was served by Deputy United States Marshal Henry Yonkin.
The Federal officials stated that they had delayed action in the matter until
every angle of the alleged blackmailing ring had been thoroughly
investigated.
     Osborn lived in Hollywood at 2575 Beechwood Drive, in a pretty bungalow
he rented from Miss Palmer.  According to Federal agents, Lasher was
introduced to Miss Palmer several months ago in this house.  Later, the two
went to Tia Juana in Miss Palmer's automobile.
     At the border city a party was staged.  A bet was made between Lasher
and the picture star, and Lasher signed a check for $1000.  During the course
of the festivities, he was administered "knockout drops" by somebody in the
party, he told the Federal agents, and when he came to himself he stopped
payment on the check.
     Mrs. Gibson, mother of the screen luminary, is said to have gone to
Lasher and threatened to make trouble for him on the ground that he had taken
her daughter across the border with wrongful intentions.  It was a short time
later, according to Lasher's statements to the Federal men, that the screen
star herself declared unless she "came across" she would cause his arrest on
a Mann Act charge.
     During her arraignment in Commissioner Long's court the pretty film star
was tearful and stood with bowed head through the proceedings.
     "It's just a put up job, I never took a cent of his money," she sobbed.
     She said that she had only met Osborn, the blackmailer, in a business
way, and that she had never had any dealings with him except as to renting
her house.
     "This is simply a matter of personal spite, and they haven't got
anything on me at all," she declared, in a tone so low that it could scarcely
be heard.  She vehemently denied ever threatening to "expose" Lasher unless
he provided her with funds.
     The screen star's mother was with her throughout the proceedings, as
also was the accused star's attorney, Patrick J. Cooney.
     Miss Palmer was in trouble once before with the authorities.  She was
arrested in 1917 by police during a raid on a Commercial Street rooming house
and a charge of vagrancy was placed against her.  She was acquitted of this
charge at the trial.  Although she never attained stardom in the films, she
has played a number of important roles in various pictures during the last
six years.

     Miss Margaret Gibson, petite film player, known professionally as
Patricia Palmer, was today at liberty on $2500 bail, following her arrest
yesterday, as reported exclusively in The Evening Herald, on a charge of
extorting $1150 from George W. Lasher, wealthy electrical contractor of
Burbank, under threat of federal prosecution.
     At the same time it became known that Miss Gibson is but one of a number
of men and women scheduled for arrest as alleged members of a blackmailing
ring declared to have victimized wealthy men of an enormous sum of money
during the past few years.
     Miss Gibson denied that she had threatened to "expose" Lasher unless he
provided her with funds.
     "I never took a cent of his money," she declared.  "It's just a matter
of personal spite."
     Her only relations with Don Osborn, convicted in Ohio of blackmailing
John L. Bushnell for $10,000, had to do with the renting of her house to him,
she said.  The arresting officers stated, however, that Miss Gibson was
introduced to Lasher by Osborn, and that the confessed blackmailer later
advised the asserted victim to make a settlement with the girl.
     Miss Gibson accepted her arrest with a philosophical calmness that was
almost startling, officers said.
     After accepting service of the warrant at the door, she called to her
mother and said:
     "Mother, these gentlemen are officers.  George Lasher has sworn to some
kind of warrant and I'll have to go with them."
     "All right," returned the mother, quietly.  "Are you going to jail?"
     "I suppose so," returned the girl.  And she went.

                         Charge Against Girl Dismissed

     Ella Margaret Gibson, known to fans of the silver screen as Patricia
Palmer, yesterday was freed from a Federal charge accusing her of extorting
$1155 from George W. Lasher, Burbank electrical contractor, on threats to
prosecute him under the Mann White Slave Act.
     The motion to dismiss the charge was made by Assistant United States
Attorney Mark L. Herron, when the preliminary hearing of the screen actress
was called before United States Commissioner Long.  Insufficiency of evidence
was the reason given for dropping the case.
     Frank Dominguez, her attorney, stated that rather than force Lasher to
give her money, following a trip taken to Tia Juana in Miss Palmer's
automobile, Miss Palmer had in fact given Lasher money, and that he had in
his possession checks totaling $600 which the actress had given Lasher.
     "This poor girl has lost her job, her mother is seriously ill in bed,
and now we are politely informed that it was all a mistake," he thundered.
     Commissioner Long said he regretted very much that the matter had gone
as far as it had.

                    More Thoughts Regarding Margaret Gibson

     In TAYLOLOLOGY 84, we speculated on the motive for Margaret Gibson's
possible involvement in the Taylor case, speculation which focused on the
obsessed-stalker motive.  But the above clippings from 1917 and 1923 throw a
great deal of light on her character and associates, forcing us to shift our
armchair speculation toward the blackmail theory of Taylor's murder.  The
1923 clipping strongly indicates that she had a close personal association
with a major blackmailer.  There were several contemporary rumors that
Taylor's killer was a blackmailer.
     Shortly before the Taylor murder, perhaps Margaret Gibson had a
discussion with Don Osborn regarding likely blackmail subjects, and she
suggested they blackmail Taylor; Osborn would threaten to expose him and ruin
his career unless he paid big money.  What would the basis of the blackmail
threat have been?  In the aftermath of the Arbuckle scandal, the movie
industry was ripe for blackmail threats because it was so highly sensitive to
negative publicity.  If something strongly negative were publicly revealed
about Taylor, who was president of the Moving Picture Director's Association
and one of Paramount's top directors, it would have a damaging effect on the
industry.  And Taylor, as a highly-paid director, would be considered an
excellent potential blackmail target.
     According to the April 18, 1914 issue of MOVING PICTURE WORLD, Taylor
was fired from Vitagraph.  He had worked there for six months, and in four of
his films he had acted opposite Margaret Gibson.  So she was probably aware
of the reason for his termination there.  If he was fired for having done
something "immoral" or illegal (but the studio had never filed legal charges
because it didn't want the negative publicity), then that knowledge could
form the basis of her blackmail threat.
     Or perhaps the threat was based, as on the clipping above, on violation
of the Mann Act, or some recent private behavior of Taylor which Gibson had
learned about.
     It was reported in the press that a man, approximately age 27, had
inquired at a local gas station two hours before the murder, asking the
location of Taylor's home. (See TAYLOROLOGY 56).  Some people think this man,
who was not Shelby or Sands, was the killer, since he was seeking Taylor just
before the murder.  Yet it seems extremely unlikely that a premeditated
murderer would deliberately expose himself to witnesses so near the crime
scene.  On the other hand, a blackmailer might have no such reluctance, since
he was not on a murder mission, but only wanted to have a quiet private
discussion with Taylor.  But Taylor, when confronted with the blackmail
attempt, tried to physically attack the blackmailer, who shot in defense and
killed Taylor.  Under this scenario, Margaret Gibson would naturally feel
responsible for Taylor's death, since it was her suggestion which ultimately
led to Taylor's shooting.
     In any event, it would be very interesting to determine whether Don
Osborn fit the description of the person seen at the gas station, and the
person seen by Faith MacLean.  That person was about 5'9" tall, much too tall
to have been Margaret Gibson (or Charlotte Shelby).  But what about Osborn?
Should he be added to the gallery of Taylor murder suspects?
     On additional thought:  During her 1917 trial, "motion picture men and
women..., all of whom testified to the good character of the film actress"
were placed on the witness stand.  Was Taylor one of those who testified?
Or, conversely, was he asked to testify but refused, causing resentment on
her part?

     Robert Birchard has also suggested the following possibilities:
     "What about this for a scenario?  Mabel's on dope, Gibson and company
threaten to spill the beans.  It's a safe bet Gibson knew Normand--they had
both been employees of the New York Motion Picture Corporation.  Mabel uses
Bill as an intermediary.  She drops off the cash when she comes a calling and
leaves before the blackmailer arives/ or alternatively, she does not drop off
the cash.  Bill tries to do right by Mabel and tell the blackmailer to piss
up a rope/ or alternatively, he has no money to give the shakedown artist.
Pow.  Brave old Bill ends up in a pile on the floor.
     "Or how about this?  Gibson tells her pals something about Taylor (or
someone else) and they decide to pull a shake down.  Gibson goes to Taylor
and he buys her off cheap with a studio contract.  Her friends are pissed.
Margaret/Patricia has gotten hers and they're left holding the bag.  Osborn
goes to lean on Taylor.  Taylor laughs in his face.  Margaret's more
interested in her career and now that she's under contract she won't squawk
and Osborne has no first hand knowledge of anything.  Pow.  Crafty old Bill
ends up in a pile on the floor.
     "Or?  Bill and Margaret got it on at Vitagraph.  She hits the skids and
he helps her--changes her name puts her under contract to the studio (or at
least gets her on the approved list for casual hires), and "that old feeling"
is rekindled in Gibson's breast--but not in Bill's.  She pleads her love,
Bill turns a deaf ear.  Hell hath no fury, etc.  Pow.  Hard-hearted old Bill
ends up in a pile on the floor, and Maggie really did pull the trigger.
     "We have the reel six confession.  All we have to do is tie it up.  Of
course, Gibson/Palmer could have been delusional in her old age and been
merely one of the many who have confessed to something they didn't do.
     "This stuff is good for another 75 years of speculation!"

      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Last word from ye editor:
     The confession alone, if it came from a Jane Doe, would have an extemely
low level of probability.  But the confessor:
     a.  Worked with Taylor for six months.
     b.  Had sinister associates, one of whom was a major blackmailer.
     c.  Was arrested for extortion stemming from events which took place
         less than a year after the Taylor murder.
     d.  Was given at least two acting roles at Famous Players-Lasky in the
         year following the murder.
Put it all together with the confession, and the probability rises
considerably.  (Come on, you Taylorologists out there!  Where else does the
Margaret Gibson trail lead?)

                    Additional Comments on Margaret Gibson
                                       
                                  by Ray Long
                                       
     There are several observations I'd like to make relative to my recent
statement regarding Margaret Gibson/Patricia Palmer/Pat Lewis.
     I stated that she was interned at Calvary Cemetery.  That is incorrect.
She was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery near Culver City, California.
     While she was very definite in her statement that she "shot and killed
William Desmond Taylor," the reason for having to flee the country now
appears to relate to a later offense.
     I believe I made a false assumption as to the motive for her sudden
departure to the Orient in 1934.  I assumed she was motivated by the never
ending investigation of the crime.  There was a constant barrage of media
reports, three district attorneys vowing they were about to apprehend the
culprit and a procession of grand juries being convened. That may not have
been the reason for her flight.
     With the revelations subsequent to the publication of Taylorology 84,
I now believe that there were other factors motivating her to take that
proverbial "slow boat to China."
     During her dying monologue, she made several statements which were
either incomprehensible, inaudible or I just plain wasn't paying attention.
Her words were directed toward my mother, not I.  I might speculate that they
related to other transgressions.  However, that would be pure guesswork on my
part.
     There is a distinct possibility that she may have been involved in
another crime equally heinous to the Taylor affair or possibly charged with
felonies in which she knew she might go to prison.  1934 appears to be a
pivotal year in her  life.  There is something there which cries out for
discovery.
     It was extremely fortuitous that she found the love of her life upon
arrival in Singapore and she married on February 9, 1935.
     Whatever occurred in 1934 may very well have been the reason for her
living in almost total obscurity after returning to the United States during
the fall of 1940.  She returned as Mrs. E. E. Lewis not as Patricia
Palmer/Margaret Gibson.
     She had not planned on returning to the United States.  Her letters
indicate that she and Elbert Lewis planned on retirement in either South
Africa or possibly Australia.
     Following her marriage in 1935, she settled down to the idyllic life of
a traveling companion to an executive of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company.
The couple traveled continuously around the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean
from Ceylon, to India, Burma, Straits Settlements and the Island of Java.
     In summer of 1940, she developed a serious bladder infection.  Treatment
was not available in the region.  She had to seek medical treatment
elsewhere.
     Europe was enveloped in war.  German surface raider ships were operating
on the Indian Ocean and making shipping extremely hazardous.  That ruled out
both Australia and South Africa.  The only remaining option was to return to
the United States.  They felt the safest route across the Pacific was through
Yokohama.  They had considered the Pan American Flying Boat through Manila
but Mrs. Lewis was afraid of flying.
     Upon her return, she underwent surgery twice at Hollywood Hospital
performed by a Doctor Branch.  Meanwhile Elbert Lewis was killed during the
Japanese bombing of the Stan-Vac facility at Penang, Straits Settlements on
March 15, 1942.  Standard Vacuum, later Mobil Oil, provided her with a small
widow's pension until her death in 1964.

Calcutta - February 8, 1942

My Most Precious Patricia:

Tomorrow marks the ending of my seven most happy years and the beginning of,
oh, so many more marvelous years, dearest, even though it had to be that we
could not share all of them together.  At those times you have lived in my
thoughts and my dreams of you have been so beautiful and wonderful.  I love
my darling wife.

I have not written for a long time, my own girl, as things have been
unsettled and I did not want to write and worry you until the atmosphere had
cleared a little.  I know you would worry but I also hoped you would believe
that nothing happens to Daddy "You must believe that, - honor bright."

I hope you received my letter from Singapore and the cables I have sent to
you from there and from other places.  In case you did not receive my
Singapore letter, I will try and recount my activities since leaving Rangoon
in late November, homeward bound to the sweetest, the loveliest, the most
adorable and most precious girl in the world for me.  The one girl I love, my
wife.

I left Rangoon on November 29th, by ship and was due to sail from Singapore
on Dec 8th. After getting as far as Penang, it appeared that I would miss
connections if I stayed on the ship, so to make certain, I left the ship at
Penang and proceeded to Singapore by rail.  I arrived in Singapore on Dec 4th
or 5th, I forgot which, only to hear the disappointing news that the ship
would not sail until around the middle of the month.  It had not arrived and
never did arrive during my stay in Singapore, as, after the trouble had
started, so she ran down south to a safer port.  I believe she is now on her
way home again but from the other direction and there was no way I could make
connections with her.

Well on the morning of Dec 8th the bombs started falling and you can imagine
what a surprise it was.  I was out at the Seaview Hotel, away from the center
of activities but quite close enough to hear all the commotion. Singapore did
not suffer much damage in the first raid, which is surprising as there was no
alarm sounded until sometime later and they had no chance to put up any
opposition.  I believe I told you about Elfin joined me that morning, Elfin,
that little mischievous unreliable girl.  She surely was a comfort though and
I knew you had sent her to me.  Now she is home again for a short time but I
realize she must have been very active for some time even before that
morning.  Do you remember, dearest, the morning of your first arrival in
Singapore, seven sweet years ago, when I pushed all the boats out of the
harbor so your ship could come in?  Well that's what Elfin was doing except
that she was pushing my ship away so it would not arrive.  Elfin knew that
had the ship been on time, I might have been in a worse position.  Tell her
I'm going to buy her a new golden dress and golden slippers too, just as soon
as I return.

After considering everything, I decided my best move would be to return to
Rangoon and eventually to Calcutta.  I could not get out of Singapore by any
means whatsoever so I returned immediately to Penang by rail thinking to get
a ship from there to Rangoon or Colombo.  I reached Penang just in time to
run into another mess of fun and decided that, after all, Singapore wasn't
such a bad spot.  The casualties in Penang were quite heavy and I returned
the following night to Singapore.  Aside from the trip across from Penang to
the mainland to catch the train the return to Singapore was uneventful.

We had quite a few more raids in Singapore up to the time I finally got away
on Dec 23rd.  During this time, I made several attempts to leave, once
signing up as a member of the crew of a ship bound for Australia and
eventually to San Pedro.  I only had an hour to catch the ship which was
lying out a mile from shore.  I arranged for a launch to meet me and grabbed
a taxi back to the hotel.  I only had time to cram some clothes in a couple
suitcases and left the rest of the stuff at the hotel to be called for by our
office.  When I arrived at the launch, I found everything OK with about 20
minutes to spare.  That is OK except for one little thing -- there was nobody
to run the launch.  The end of the story is that I sadly watched the ship
steam away leaving behind it one of their crew.  Next, I was offered passage
on a gasoline tanker going to Rangoon.  This offer I respectfully declined
as, while I did not mind being on a ship which might be hit, I did not like
the idea of being thrown into a sea of blazing oil.  Finally, as I say, I got
away on Dec 23rd having secured a first class deck passage on a ship to
Batavia.  It took two days to get there, after zig-zagging all over the place
and going around in circles.  I spent a very pleasant three days at the Hotel
des Indes with no air raid alarms although I imagine they are having a few of
them there now.  Our old mandoer at the hotel was tickled to see me and, as
all of them do, his first question was about Njonja.  I saw Sandy Maer and
Pauline and Bill Ogden and some of the rest of the people you know and all of
them asked about Patricia.

On Dec 28th, I managed to secure air passage from Batavia to Rangoon as we
left in the morning landed at Palembang.  While refueling at the airport and
having a fattening up potion, I ran across Mr. McCall.  You may remember him
at Pendops as the one who was saving silver half dollars.  Leaving Palembang
we headed for Singapore after about two hours with no incidents to report.
Singapore was my only fear as I feared I might get kicked off there if some
army men had priority.  That would have put me right back where I had started
from.  I breathed a sigh of relief when we left Singapore and headed for
Medan where we arrived about 2 1/2 hours later.  We now appeared to be well
away from the center of activities and while they refueled the plane, I went
into the airport building for another bottle of beer.  We had been on the
ground about twenty minutes and I was calmly drinking my beer when the report
arrived that a number of planes were approaching.  It was not known whether
they were friendly or enemy planes so everyone rushed to the entrance or
outside to watch them come in.  I still had a sip of beer left in my glass
and as Njonja knows, I hate to leave any beer.  I, therefore, was late
getting to the entrance and arrived just in time to see six planes nearly
overhead.  I had only one glimpse of them, and did not see their markings or
anything but for some reason or other they did not look good to me.  I had
only time to take two steps back into the building and throw myself on the
floor.  Before I reached the floor the remains of the building came down on
us and we were buried in about six inches of tiles and plaster.  Fortunately
the building was of very light construction and there wasn't too much to
fall.  Immediately the bombs started falling they began machine gunning and
again Elfin must have been there as the nearest they came to me was the
fellows lying right alongside.  You can imagine that I was a sight when I
crawled out from under with only a few lumps on the head and some minor
scratches.  There were said to be 17 planes in all but six was all I saw.
I wasn't interested in looking for the rest of them. Unfortunately, our plane
was also hit and the last I saw of it when leaving the airport, it was a mass
of flames.  Everything I had with me (a suitcase and my briefcase) was
destroyed, and worst of all, the pictures I was carrying of my Njonja.
It was a warm day and I had left my coat on the plane.  Could you, my
dearest, send me some more pictures.  I still have my ring that Njonja gave
to me and the ring that I gave to Njonja.  The ring that belongs to Njonja
has a couple slight cracks in it but still looks beautiful.  I had my hands
over my head for protection and something must have hit it.  I still have my
belt buckle but the marvelous present from my sweetheart is gone, my comb and
nail file and pretty tie clasp.  Someday, my precious will you replace them.
My comb and nail file were in my coat and the tie clasp must have been lost
in the shuffle.  I searched for it as long as I dared but it could not be
found.

Having lost our plane there was nothing to do but wait for another and that
one didn't arrive for eight days.  I stayed at the manager's house in Medan,
about a block from the airport, and borrowed some clothes from him until I
could buy more.  What I hadn't lost on the plane, I left at Batavia, but
when, if ever I will get there again nobody knows.  That is the least of our
worries.

Eight days is a long time to lay around doing nothing so I went down to the
installation one day to check their stocks for them.  Most of that day was
spent running from the godowns to the air raid shelter and finally I gave it
up.  Their system of alarm while I was there was not very good. There was no
alarm giver for the first raid until some minutes after the bombs had been
dropped and once when checking stocks, the planes had been overhead for five
minutes before the alarm sounded.  They were quite high and I could not hear
them from inside the godown.  Fortunately they were only taking pictures and
dropped no bombs.

About three o'clock in the morning, we took off for Rangoon arriving at two
in the afternoon of Jan 5th.  Rangoon had had several raids before I arrived,
two of them quite serious as far as casualties were concerned.  The first
thing I did on arrival was to stop into the office and leave my baggage while
I went to find a much needed beer.  If I keep this up there is going to be
more beer than bombs in this little story.  You should have seen my baggage
when I arrived.  I had three each of shirts, underwear and socks which I
bought in Medan as well as a cheap safety razor and toothbrush.  All of it
was crammed into two small tiny fibre suitcases.  The suitcases were the
funniest part of the whole performance, You would have gotten a great kick
our of them.

I hadn't been in town for over twenty minutes and had just taken my last sip
of beer when the alarm sounded.  I hadn't paid for the beer yet and you can
imagine that I didn't worry much about that but rushed back for the office as
soon as I could.  They are in a fine new building with the best basement in
town and as it was only two blocks away, I took a chance on getting to it
rather than some other place less secure especially since there were no
planes overhead.  You may wonder why I know where to head for but I'm
gradually getting smart about those things.  My first thought nowadays when I
arrive anyplace is to spy out the best and strongest hiding places within a
reasonable distance.

I stayed in Rangoon for 17 days and we were continually bothered with air
raids, most of them at night.  The Strand Hotel had to close up after the
first couple of raids as all their servants flew the coop so I stayed at
Pollards.  You could get a room if you wanted to at the Strand but you had to
make your own beds and rustle your own food.  The few guests who remained
were cooking and serving their own food out in the kitchen when I arrived.
Besides, the Strand Hotel wasn't in too healthy a spot these days and Pollard
had fixed up a pretty good hide-out at his place.

When I got to Rangoon, I found out I had a job all cut out and it is
certainly a fine one.  Hong Kong had lost all of their records when the place
fell and it's my job to try and piece things together again.  It seemed worse
than a Humpty-Dumpty problem at first but things are gradually taking shape.
Hired eight clerks at Rangoon and fortunately I have the assistance of Chari
who came over from India to help out.  He certainly has been a lot of help
and is one of the few who have stuck with us.  Because of interruptions in
work when air raid alarms sounded and because of a general nervousness after
each raid, it was decided to move all our records to Calcutta and I managed
to obtain boat passage for Chari and two other clerks.  A fourth clerk is now
on the way by land, a great part of the trip which has to be done on foot.

After seeing that arrangements had been made to get Chari and the others out,
I took a train to Lashio (north of Mandalay and the western end of the Burma
Road) hoping it would be possible to get a plane from there to Calcutta.  It
was out of the question flying direct to Calcutta from Rangoon is the planes
were all booked for months to come and besides it didn't look to favorable at
the time.

Arrived in Lashio which might remind you of a boom town out west and spent 4
days in a shack built of Piano boxes or something waiting to catch a plane
out.  Went out to the airfield to meet every plane that arrived but each one
was fully booked up and they could carry no more passengers.  Finally, on the
fourth day, a plane came through which had been badly machine gunned by the
Japs in ferrying people out of Hong Kong and which they were bringing to
India for repairs.  They nicknamed it the "flying sieve" which was very
appropriate only it had a lot more holes in it than the ordinary sieve.  It
was certainly "air-conditioned."  It was not in the best condition and they
did not want to take passengers but I figured if the pilot and crew were
willing to take a chance, it was OK with me.  Besides, I promised to buy the
pilot a bottle of beer when we landed in Calcutta.  Well, after a little
talking, we took off and arrived safely about five hours later. Incidently,
I bought the pilot two bottles of beer.

Things are much quieter in Calcutta and we are able to get much more work
done here than in Rangoon.  As most of our information comes from China and
as we can get air mail from there in one day the communications system is
also much better to Calcutta than it was in Rangoon.  I expect, in a few
weeks, if things look promising, to take a trip up to Chungking in China and
see what I can find out from there.  Expect to be away for two or three weeks
and then return to India.

Please, my precious wife, do not worry too much about your daddy who loves
you so much.  Daddy will take every precaution to travel safely so that one
day, I hope soon, we can be home together, to always be together, me and the
"best gal in the world."

My passport has expired and I will have to get a new one soon.  I will send
you one of my passport photos when I have some taken.

Daddy is perfectly well, not a single solitary injury, no nervousness, no
shell blast, no nothing except the mostest love for his pretty girl.

I love you my darling - Elbert

PS:  Tell mother I will write to her in a day or so. I do not have her
address, as my address book is no more, so I have to have you send the letter
on to her. My best love to your mother. Tell her I rely upon her to take good
care of my most precious wife.

Love - Elbert
