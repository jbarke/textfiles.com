                    Police Corner Suspect in Taylor Murder
                       Believe Solution of Slaying Near

     Detectives admitted late today that they had under surveillance a
prominent young man who might possibly be linked with the murder of William
Desmond Taylor, prominent motion picture director, who was found shot to
death in his luxurious apartments at 404-B South Alvarado street.
     The detectives have been watching this mysterious man all day.  They
would not divulge his name, but said that they were confident that he may
have had something to do with the shooting of Taylor.  If he tries to leave
town, it is said, he will be taken into custody.
     An expert gunsmith, whose name was not divulged, has offered his
services to Captain of Detectives David Adams.  He is to take the bullet
which was extracted from Taylor's body and by examination tell what kind of
gun was used.
     The inquest will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow, it was announced late
today.  The inquest was originally scheduled to be held at 1:30 p.m.
     Two witnesses, who were questioned today, and said to be very prominent
in the motion picture world, declared they saw two men, one of whom answered
the description of Edward Sands, loitering about the Taylor home some time
before the shooting.
     The time of the shooting has been placed at between 7:45 p.m. and 8:15.
Taylor's chauffeur told the detectives that he tried to call his employer at
8:15 on the night of the murder, and was unable to get him.  He said he
assumed that the director had stepped out.
     Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York
broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to
bring to light more facts about the murder.
     This young man is said to have been prominent in movie society.
     He is described as a friend of a prominent movie actress.
     He came from the east, according to the story which detectives are
investigating, shortly after the actress returned from a trip to New York,
which she made some months ago.
     Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed he might
possibly shed on the mysterious slaying...
     Police detectives are concentrating today on the theory that Taylor
probably was murdered by a "love killer"--a man who resented Taylor's
attention to some woman...
     A guest in the Dumas home next to Taylor said he saw two men last Monday
night in the court yard.  The men, the guest said, went to the door of
Taylor's home, tried the door with a key, then walked away.  One of these
men, the police believe, is probably the murderer.
     Taylor's colored valet, Harry [sic] Peavey, who found the body, said
that on several occasions Taylor had been annoyed by mysterious persons
walking around his house.  He said that on one occasion he asked Taylor why
he didn't carry his gun.
     "Somebody is liable to walk up those stairs when you're in your
bedroom," he said he told Taylor, "and hold you up."
     "No, he won't," Peavey said Taylor replied.  "I keep my gun on the
bureau, and if I hear anyone walking up those stairs and he doesn't answer
when I call him, he's a goner."
     Peavey said Taylor did drive away these nocturnal visitors on several
occasions at the point of a gun....
     The newest clues, vague, but showing possibilities of untangling the
mystery point to two or more unrequited loves for the murdered man.  These
women, beautiful, young and prominent, are said to have displayed affections
for Taylor, who it is reported did not reciprocate.  Tips over the telephone
and by letter have come to the police station regarding the mystery slaying.
So many angles of this case have developed that it is difficult to find any
tangible clue that would lead to the discovery of the assassin....

                                                                 Linton Wells

                            "Never Any Love Affair"
                             So Says Mabel Normand
                                       
     "If I had been engaged to marry Mr. Taylor, I would be only too proud to
acknowledge it."
     In such manner did Miss Mabel Normand, movie star, reiterate to me her
denial of any engagement with William D. Taylor, the director, who was
murdered Wednesday evening.
     Tears were in Miss Normand's eyes, her lithe body quivered and shook.
She was under a terrible nervous strain.  Her voice quavered and broke while
she spoke of the dead man.
     "I had known Mr. Taylor for years," she continued, "ever since I've
lived at the Buckingham, but there never was any love affair existing between
us--ever!"
     "I loved Mr. Taylor as a good comrade--a pal with whom I could discuss
subjects in which we were both mutually interested.  For instance, I had been
studying French and Mr. Taylor, who spoke French fluently, helped me
tremendously.  And, too, I have been somewhat interested in philosophy and
metaphysics, and in those subjects he was again an invaluable teacher.
     "I seldom saw Mr. Taylor, it's true, except at a gathering of friends.
But frequently I conversed with him over the telephone.  As a general rule
merely to ask certain questions regarding the subjects I just mentioned.
     "Wednesday evening was the first time I ever called upon Mr. Taylor
alone.  Then I stopped in for a few minutes on my way home in response to a
message from Mr. Taylor left with my secretary.  The message stated that Mr.
Taylor already had sent one book I wanted to the house and had purchased
another--one I wanted particularly--and had it at his place.  It was for that
book that I stopped by.
     "I arrived about 7 o'clock and left at 7:45.  He accompanied me to my
car and talked to me a few minutes, laughingly criticizing my literary taste;
there was a copy of the Police Gazette in the car and he thought it didn't
very well fit in with Freud and Nietsche.
     "After saying good night and promising to phone me within an hour, I
directed William, my chauffeur, to drive me home.  Being tired and having a
studio call at 7:30 next morning, I retired to my room and within a few
minutes I was in bed, where I had dinner served to me.  That was about 8:15.
Then I dropped off to sleep and slept until Edna Purviance phoned me the
following morning the news of Mr. Taylor's death.
     "Did I know that Mr. Taylor had been married?  No.  I don't know now
that he was.  People had told me, but I don't know if it was true.  Mr.
Taylor never discussed with me his private affairs; there was no reason for
his doing so.
     "I am so terribly shocked over this horrible tragedy I don't know what
to do or say.  It doesn't seem possible that anyone so lovable--a man who had
so many friends and not a known enemy could have been so brutally killed.
     "My one wish is that the murderer be apprehended and that punishment,
however horrible, be meeted out to him."

     "No, I never was engaged to marry William Desmond Taylor, I regret to
say.
     "No, I was not at his home on the night he was murdered.  I was at my
home reading a book.
     "I had seen very little of him since we returned from Europe a year ago.
     "He didn't have an enemy in the world.
     "I am positive he was never married, because he would have told me so if
he was.
     "I love little Mabel Normand and I want the whole world to know that I
love her, and appreciate her sterling qualities."
     These were the outstanding statements regarding the mysterious murder of
her former director, William Desmond Taylor, made by pretty Mary Miles Minter
in an interview at her home last night.
     Curled up before the fireplace of her quaint adobe home with its soft
lights and Spanish furnishings, the lovely blonde star was the center of an
interested group of newspaper folk, who wished to employ her aid in solving
the murder of the man so brutally slain.
     Miss Minter has a cold.  She was exposed to a cold water bath in the
filming of a picture last week, and is recuperating from her experience.  But
in an attractive dark frock that set off her blonde beauty and with golden
hair, she was a pretty picture sitting before the crackling flames.
     Never in her varied but successful career has the screen star figured in
a more interesting story than the one in which her former director lost his
life.  Miss Minter wants to help clear up the mystery and do all in her power
to bring the slayer to justice.
     "I could use every praiseworthy adjective in the English language to
describe him," she said, "and still could not explain to you what a wonderful
man he was.
     "I had never met a man like him.  He was loved by everyone who knew him.
You just couldn't help trusting him.
     "And everyone who ever had business dealings with him appreciated his
kindness, consideration for others, his generosity.
     "Just think," the star broke down, "here I was home, reading a book--
enjoying it so much--and he was lying there in his apartment, stone dead.
     "Oh, I cannot believe that he has been murdered!
     "Why, I went to his house this morning--mamma and I (pointing to her
charming grandmother, Mrs. Mary Miles)--I always call grandma 'mamma' and
mother 'mother'--and I couldn't believe he was dead!
     "I loved him--of course not as--well, you know--but I loved him
devotedly.  He looked upon me more or less as a child, don't you know.  And,
although I saw a great deal of him before I went to Europe, after we got back
we couldn't drag him away from his work, could we, mother?" the star asked
her youthful parent, Mrs. Selby [sic], who smiled indulgently upon her pretty
daughter.
     "No," said Mrs. Selby, "he was more a hard worker.  Really, he was more
interested in his business than anything else.
     "Do you know where his ex-wife and daughter are?" Miss Minter was asked.
     Miss Minter's violet colored eyes flashed fire.
     "Why he had no wife--he was never married.  I'm positive of that!" she
replied.
     "But, maybe Mary, he didn't tell you he was married," broke in Mother.
     "But mother, I knew him so well--I am sure he wasn't married.  I asked
him if he was, and he told me no.
     "I don't think he was interested in women particularly," said the star.
"I never was engaged to marry him--no, it wouldn't be fair to say that I was.
Of course," she laughed, "every once in a while someone has me engaged to
someone--they've had me engaged to eight men this year.
     "You see he was nearly 50 years old--and although if I loved him and he
was 75 I would marry him--but oh, no, there was nothing to that."
     "Had you heard of a romance between Mabel Normand and Mr. Taylor?" Miss
Minter was asked.
     "No, I hadn't," she said, "but I don't think there was anything to that.
If it is true that he had asked to marry her, well I am glad that he and
Mabel were such good friends.  Mabel is a lovely girl.  She is frank--if she
wants to do anything she does it--that's why I admire Mabel.
     "And she is big-hearted and noble of character.  I love Mabel Normand."
     "When did you see Mr. Taylor last?" the actress was asked.
     "Let's see," she pondered.  "I hadn't seen dear old Mr. Taylor since
before Christmas.  In fact, I hadn't seen him in a year.  Oh, yes, we passed
him on the boulevard yesterday --just think, it was a few hours before he was
murdered."
     Miss Minter was almost in tears.
     "Have they found his former valet?" she asked suddenly.  She intimated
that she believed Edward F. Sands was the villain, but she said: "It would be
unfair to accuse anyone of the crime.  Maybe a crank or some demented person
committed it.  Did you see 'The Bat' at the Mason?  There is a mystery story
that would thrill you.  You would sit on the edge of the seat while it is
showing.  I saw it in New York."

     Another tip in connection with the Taylor murder mystery "blew up" at
noon today.
     It was the clue that Edward Sands, former secretary and valet for the
murdered man, was being held at the city jail.
     Upon investigation it was found that a Sands was in jail, but that his
name is Edward W. Sands.
     He was arrested for petty larceny at a downtown department store and
sentenced to serve 30 days in the city jail.
     Sands was given probation several years ago by Judge Craig after his
conviction on a charge of grand larceny in connection with the alleged theft
of automobile tires.  He is now held at the county jail pending a hearing in
Judge Reeve's court for violation of parole.

                                                        OAKLAND POST-DISPATCH
     William D. Taylor, whose murder at Hollywood has shaken the screen world
to almost as great an extent as the trial of Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, was an
Oakland visitor two years ago.
     Taylor and Mary Miles Minter, whom he was directing, came here at that
time for Realart.  Both the screen star and her director were guests of the
Ad Club at that time.  Miss Minter made two appearances at a local theater.
     The director's interest in Miss Minter was that of a father.  He watched
her movements, refused to allow her to walk from the Hotel Oakland entrance
to a waiting automobile until the rain had subsided; guarded her against
admirers when she was obliged to force her way through a crowded theater
lobby and once, when they were seated and witnessing one of Miss Minter's own
pictures, refused to allow other members of the party to disturb her with
questions.

     Henry Peavey, 40, of 127 1/2 East Third street, who found the body of
William D. Taylor, famous motion picture director, found murdered in his home
at 404B South Alvarado street, was scheduled to go to police court yesterday
afternoon to face a charge of social vagrancy.  Peavey, according to
Patrolman S. G. White, was arrested, charged with being lewd and dissolute in
Westlake park a few hours before his employer was murdered.  Taylor, it is
said, bailed the negro out.
     His case was taken off the calendar after Taylor's death.  No date was
set for the trial.

                                                           SAN FRANCISCO CALL
     Los Angeles--...The seven detectives who are most actively engaged in
hunting the murderer told the International News Service it is one of the
most baffling cases in the annals of the local police department.  It was
stated that a complete probe will be made of Taylor's past life in an effort
to get behind the veil of mystery surrounding the case and bring the slayer
to justice.
     "Wherever the trail leads, there will be detectives to follow," said one
police official.  "There will be no whitewashing of any person or any group
of persons."
     One of the foremost moving picture actresses was scheduled to be
questioned late today regarding her asserted love for Taylor.  While no
suspicion rests on the woman, the police say, she may be able to throw a
direct ray of light on some asserted love tangle in which Taylor may have
been a principal.
     Among the various phases of the investigation was a report that Taylor
had attended several so-called "snow" parties, at which narcotics were served
from tea wagons, for the purpose of obtaining local color for some of his
pictures.  The slaying, one detective pointed out, may have been an aftermath
of such a party.
     Weird narratives of a mystic love cult also entered into the
investigation when reports to the police linked Taylor's name with the
strange life of the cult leaders.
     The weird love which was said to have existed as a part of the cult may
have inspired one of the members to have caused Taylor's death, according to
another detective who spent considerable time in delving into the mysticisms
and entanglements of the asserted coterie...
     One of Taylor's closest friends, and a former business associate, told
the International News Service this afternoon that he has arrived at the
conclusion the director was killed at the instigation of a woman.
     "I have been in touch with the police for 24 hours," said this man, "and
I know the theories on which they have been working.  They have now arrived
at the belief he was murdered in a vengeance plot.
     "I know Taylor was very friendly with one woman screen star.  He gave
her a farewell party last summer before he went to Europe.  He took her to
the Writers' Cramp, a notable entertainment recently given for the
celebrities of 'movie' colony.
     "The director and I had many conversations of a personal nature.  But he
was more or less of a man of mystery.  I do not know that he had been
friendly in recent months with any woman other than the screen actress, but
it seems likely to me that a man of his engaging personality and magnetic
charm should have attracted a number of women.
     "Since I am positive that he had no business enemies, I am inclined to
believe a woman's hand was at the bottom of it all and that the man who fired
the shot was paid to do it."

     ...The detectives sent into Hollywood to run down the slayer of Taylor
were instructed to overlook no whisper of gossip that might bring the answer
to the riddle of death.  They were told to inquire especially, it was stated,
about a recent "party" where dope, ether, cocaine and morphine took the place
of wine and whisky.  The party ended in a savage brawl, it was declared, in
which two infuriated women attacked each other and fought as men fight until
their clothes were ripped off.  Both of them, the report insists, were
prominent actresses, whose names are known to the police.  They were to be
questioned during the day.

     ...Police said today that the arrest of a mystery man seen loitering in
the vicinity of the Taylor residence about the time of the murder was
believed near.  This man, seen by many persons, was suspected of having
killed Taylor because of jealousy.  It was believed that the man under
suspicion was intimate with some woman friend of the slain director...

     Los Angeles--...Three main theories were built by the police:
     1--That Taylor was slain by a jealous woman or one whom he had enraged.
     2--That a cast-off lover of some woman with whom Taylor had been
friendly had sought this means of revenge.
     3--That a hired assassin made his way into the Taylor home as Taylor
took Miss Normand to her automobile.
     It was on these theories broadly that the police were working.  Armed
with them, they took up the murderer's trail in the gay set of the moving
picture world--the fast clique whose "secret" orgies and debaucheries are
scarcely secret.
     Taylor was popular and, the police declare, it would have been almost
impossible for him to avoid these wild "parties" even if he took no part in
the mad dissipations and excesses.  In fact, it was reported that he had
escorted several women to these affairs.

                                                          LOS ANGELES EXPRESS
                                                                             
    Two Film Actresses and Two Men are Linked with Taylor Murder by Police
                                       
     The names of two young film actresses and a man who has so far not
figured in the case were linked by the police today in their investigation
into the slaying of William Desmond Taylor, noted film director.  The names
of these persons are for the time being withheld by the police.  The man,
however, is known to have had a bitter quarrel with Taylor within the last
month.  He is under surveillance.
     Another man, who has already been questioned by the police, is also
being watched and may again be quizzed before dawn tomorrow.  The police are
convinced that he has not told all he may know of circumstances surrounding
the case.
     These facts are the outstanding ones today in the now famous murder
mystery, known in police circles as the Taylor murder.  It is calling forth
the best efforts of seven detective sergeants, and many plainclothes
officers.
     Subpenas for more than a half score of film stars and men prominent in
the motion picture industry were served by police detectives today for the
inquest at 1:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon over the body of Taylor.
     Among those who will testify will be Mary Miles Minter, Douglas MacLean,
Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Charles Eyton, Mrs. Douglas MacLean and Mrs.
Julia Crawford Ivers.
     The inquest will be conducted by Coroner Nance and his chief assistant,
William McDonald, in the mortuary of the Ivy H. Overholtzer undertaking
establishment.
     Directly after Detective Sergeants Ziegler and Walls had left with the
subpenas, Detective Sergeants Wood, Murphy, Herman Cline, Winn, Cato and
Cahill left for separate places to run down clues that had been sent to
Detective Capt. Dave Adams within the last 12 hours.
     These officers were to meet late today to report to Captain Adams the
results of their quests.  In the meantime it is known that two of the
officers were questioning closely Taylor's chauffeur, in an effort to learn
the places he had taken the film director during the last few weeks that
might reveal some clew as to the identity of possible enemies...
     One important fact was brought out by Detective Sergeant Herman Cline,
opening up theories of possible robbery as motive.  It was known to several
friends that on Wednesday Taylor had in his possession in gold and currency
$2300.  He had intended putting this money in the bank the following day, but
for some unknown reason he visited the bank late Wednesday and deposited the
money.
     It is the belief of Sergeant Cline that if robbery was the motive the
burglar after firing the shot became frightened that the noise might have
aroused some persons in the neighborhood, and fled without attempting to
steal anything...
     Several things have been discovered in Taylor's past, the officers say,
that may assist in solving the mystery.  The police today were close on the
trail of a man who three hours before the murder made inquiries in the
neighborhood as to the location of Taylor's home...
     Taylor was a man who possessed great nerve and coolness under any
circumstances.  Friends say he probably would have refused to obey the order
of a burglar to hold up his hands.  Such being the case, it is possible
according to the robbery theory that the burglar fired the one shot that
ended the man's life...
     An investigation was also put under way to determine whether or not the
mysterious telephone calls frequently received by Taylor might lead to the
identity of the murderer.  The director, his friends say, often told of the
calls in the night.  When he answered there was no answer, it is said.
     This phase of the situation, however, the police believe, indicates that
some one laid careful plans for the murder of the director and had long borne
a grudge against him...

     "Some one will be under arrest before nightfall, charged with the murder
of William D. Taylor."
     This was the positive assertion here today of Detective Captain David L.
Adams, directing a corps of operatives attempting to solve the murder mystery
which has almost completely paralyzed the movie world.
     It was rumored throughout Hollywood today that police had established
jealousy as the motive for the murder of the veteran director, and were
looking for a man said to have expressed a deep-rooted hatred for Mr. Taylor
because of the latter's attentions to a woman...
     The "wanted" man is said to have invaded Taylor's beautiful bungalow at
Westlake Terrace Court on several occasions, and to have been driven away
each time at the point of a revolver...
     Thursday morning the Terraces were awakened by the cries of Mr. Taylor's
colored man, Henry Peazy [sic].  Mr. and Mrs. MacLean, Miss Edna Purviance of
the Chaplin studios and others rushed into the Taylor bungalow and found its
owner stretched on the floor dead, with a bullet through his back.  He had
been seated at a desk, facing a picture of Miss Normand, when an assassin
shot him from behind.
     On a nearby tabouret was found glasses and a decanter containing gin and
orange juice.  The fact that more than one of the glasses contained a bit of
orange juice in the bottom showed that Taylor had not been drinking by
himself.  Newspapermen unearthed more liquor upstairs in Taylor's home,
before it was hurriedly removed by his friends...

     Feb. 3--...What the police regard as an important clue was discovered
this afternoon.  Detectives are investigating "a dope party" given at
Hollywood recently, at which cocaine and other drugs were served instead of
drinks.  Two women, both film actresses, stated that they quarreled over
Taylor and fought, ripping the clothes from each other's bodies.  Taylor was
not present at the party.  The police theory is that Taylor's murder was
contrived by one of the women, to whose advances he had refused to respond...

                   Woman Star New Focus in Taylor Death Case
            Investigation of Murder Swings to Actress and Director,
                         While Ex-Secretary is Hunted
                                       
     A motion picture actress whose name has thus far not been mentioned in
connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, famous film director,
late last night was the center of investigation of the combined forces of
detectives detailed to solve the mystery of the slaying.  Mr. Taylor was shot
to death within a few minutes after Mabel Normand left his home last
Wednesday night.
     For almost four hours the detectives closely questioned former employees
of Mr. Taylor in an endeavor to check details of their new theory of the
crime, which, they still believe, was inspired by a revenge motive with
jealousy as the probable cause.
     Throughout the long questioning, which was conducted in the Detective
Bureau of Central Police Station, every attempt was made to find out all
facts regarding the past life and recent movements of Mr. Taylor.
     His friendship with such prominent motion-picture stars as Mabel
Normand, Mary Miles Minter and Claire Windsor was discussed in detail.  Many
new features of his life were disclosed during the examination of these
former employees.
     With the motion-picture actress mentioned last night the name of a
director also was linked.  The officers believe these two persons may be able
to aid materially in clearing up the case.
     Throughout this investigation, however, efforts of the detectives were
also directed toward finding Edward F. sands, former secretary and who was
made defendant in a complaint in which Mr. Taylor charged him with forgery.
Sands was in Los Angeles, the police believe, both on the day of the shooting
and also the day before.  Another witness saw him several days before the
crime, they say.
     From Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of a former chauffeur of Mr. Taylor, it was
learned she saw Sands last Tuesday, the day before the shooting.  This
meeting was in another part of the city, far removed from 404-B South
Alvarado street, where Mr. Taylor, shot in the back, was found Thursday
morning.
     Another witness is said to have seen Sands on South Alvarado street the
night of the murder.  These clews have caused the investigators to redouble
their efforts to find the former employee, because they believe he can throw
valuable light on the life of Mr. Taylor.
     Earl Tiffany, who was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until a short time after
Tiffany says he told Mr. Taylor he believed he would keep a record of the
trips on which he took him, also was questioned.  Mr. Tiffany added many
clews to the few already in the possession of the detectives.
     He related in detail, as he remembered the incidents, many supposed
facts concerning Mr. Taylor's friendship for Mary Miles Minter, film star
whom he formerly directed, then for Mabel Normand, also an actress, and
before either of them another woman whose activities are now being
investigated by the police.
     After Mr. Tiffany was questioned, Harry Fellows, assistant director for
Mr. Taylor and brother of Howard Fellows, Mr. Taylor's last chauffeur, was
taken to the room with the detectives.  He was closeted for a long time.  In
the meanwhile his wife and sister-in-law waited impatiently outside for him.
     Mr. Fellows is understood to have told the officers he could remember
few details that might aid them.  He formerly was chauffeur fro Mr. Taylor,
but is asserted to have declared he could not recall the names of some of the
persons about whom the detectives wanted to know.
     Mr. Tiffany was chauffeur for Mr. Taylor until last July.  He had
considerable experience as a chauffeur for another prominent motion-picture
man during an exciting night just preceding an action for divorce filed by
the latter's wife.
     Because of this experience, Mr. Tiffany says, he remarked to Mr. Taylor
one day that he believed he would keep a diary on the trips he made so that
he could know just where he went every day and would have record of it.  Mr.
Taylor said nothing, Mr. Tiffany says, but in a fortnight told Mr. Tiffany he
would not require his services longer.
     Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany, both of whom know Sands personally and are
familiar with his habits and opinions, believe he will be able to throw
little light on the case except inasmuch as Mr. Taylor's past life may aid in
solving the mystery.
     In telling of the incidents in Mr. Taylor's life which he observed, Mr.
Tiffany said Mary Miles Minter formerly was a favored friend of Mr. Taylor.
No other girl appeared to enter into Mr. Taylor's attentions.
     Later, a change came about, according to Mr. Tiffany, and on occasions
when Miss Minter called at the Taylor house, Sands told her Mr. Taylor was
not at home, when in fact, he was.
     About this time Mabel Normand came in for more and more attention from
Mr. Taylor, the chauffeur's story continues.  She was still the ruling
favorite among the friends of Mr. Taylor, when Mr. Tiffany left his employ.
     In connection with this fact, Henry Peavey, negro houseman of the slain
man, and who was questioned by the police again yesterday, said Mr. Taylor
told him that if Miss Normand telephoned between 5 and 6 o'clock on the night
of the slaying he was home, but if anyone else called he was not.
     Detective Sergeants Herman Cline, Winn, Murphy, Cato and Cahill, were
active in the further questioning that took place last night...
     The name of Claire Windsor, motion-picture star who once was reported
engaged to Charlie Chaplin, was thrust into the investigation when it was
learned that she had been out riding and to a dinner with Mr. Taylor a week
or so before the murder.  It was the first time she had ever been out with
him, her mother stated yesterday.  The officers expressed a wish to ascertain
whether she knew of any possible enemies, but Miss Windsor could not be
located.
     The Coroner's inquest will be held this morning at 10 o'clock at the Ivy
Overholtzer undertaking establishment.  Several film celebrities have been
subpoenaed to appear at the inquest.
     Mabel Normand, film actress, again was questioned by the police.  No
additional information was obtained, it was stated.  Miss Normand relating
again that she left Mr. Taylor's flat about 7:45 or 7:50 o'clock on the night
of the murder and that Mr. Taylor accompanied her to her automobile.  In this
she was corroborated by her negro [sic] chauffeur, William Davis, also
subpoenaed for the inquest.  Mr. Taylor was shot, the police believe, within
a very few minutes after Miss Normand left.
     The District Attorney's office swung into action in the case when a
survey of the premises was made under the direction of Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty.
Doran.  Investigators from that office also were working on the mystery.
     Information was sought from Mary Miles Minter, a film-actress friend,
who rushed to the house, becoming almost hysterical when she confirmed the
report she had received Thursday morning that Mr. Taylor was murdered.
Little information of value was obtained from her.
     The efforts to locate Miss Windsor yesterday assumed a peculiar turn.
At her home her mother stated Miss Windsor was out on location with Marshall
Neilan.  At the studios of Mr. Neilan it was stated he was on location, but
that Miss Windsor was not.
     Her mother said Miss Windsor had been with Mr. Taylor recently, but that
for the last week has been very busy on location, being compelled to work
late at night and into the early morning.  For this reason she has been
sleeping at the studio, and had not been home except at rare intervals, she
stated.
     Charles Maigne, director at the Lasky studio, was closeted for more than
an hour yesterday afternoon with Captain of Detectives Moffatt.  The nature
of the conference was not divulged.
     The motion-picture colony yesterday continued to seethe with the mystery
of how and why Mr. Taylor, one of the leading figures in the industry, was
murdered.  Many rumors and reports connecting names of film stars in a way
tending to show they may know something of the motives of the slayer were
received during the day by the investigators...

     Witnesses at the inquest will include many nationally known persons who
have been interviewed by police detectives concerning their knowledge of the
crime.  Those subpoenaed yesterday by Detective Sergt. Jack Wallis include
the following:
     Mabel Normand, one of the best-known comediennes in the motion-picture
profession and who was the last known person to have seen and talked with
Mr. Taylor before his death.  She had visited his home to get a book he
had purchased for her and left his apartment only a few minutes before the
time of his murder.
     Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of a widely known motion-picture star, whose
front door is only a few paces from Mr. Taylor's apartment.  Mrs. MacLean,
upon hearing a shot, opened her door, looked out and saw a man leaving the
Taylor apartments.  She is the only person who has given the investigators an
unquestioned first-hand description of the slayer.
     Charles Eyton, general manager of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation,
and the fourth husband of Kathlyn Williams, also a motion-picture star.  Mr.
Eyton, a personal friend of the slain man, was one of the first persons to
arrive at the Taylor apartments and conducted an inventory of the murdered
man's property.
     Verne Dumas, wealthy oil man, who also was one of the first neighbors to
enter the apartment.
     William Davis, Miss Normand's chauffeur, who drove her to Mr. Taylor's
home.  His story corroborates that of his employer.
     Henry Peavey, colored servant employed by Mr. Taylor, who first
discovered the body and who will relate incidents pertaining to the finding
of the body.
     Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, who is expected to corroborate
the time of the murder.  Mr. Fellows visited the Taylor apartment at 8 p.m.
on the night of the crime and though the home was lighted in all rooms he
received no response at the door.  He later called his employer on the
telephone but failed to arouse anybody.
     E. J. Jessrund [sic], owner of the apartment occupied by Mr. Taylor and
a neighbor who was one of the first to respond to Peavey's cries of "murder."
     Autopsy Surgeon Wagner, who will relate his findings in diagnosing the
cause of Mr. Taylor's death.

                          Suspect Taylor Feared Death
                                       
     Did William D. Taylor, murdered film director of nation-wide fame, fear
the fate in store for him and take every precaution the last few days of his
life to surround his movements and whereabouts with utmost secrecy?
     This was the question asked yesterday by the investigators in their
effort to reconstruct the circumstances that led to the slaying of the famous
director in his palatial flat on Alvarado street last Wednesday night.
     A clew that led the officers to believe Taylor was uneasy about
something in the days immediately preceding the shooting, was given to
Detective Sergeants Cline, Murphy, Winn and Ziegler, yesterday, by Henry
Peavey, colored porter and housekeeper for Taylor.
     Peavey was taken to the detective bureau of Central Police Station
yesterday afternoon and there questioned by the officers on the case.  His
examination followed that of Howard Fellows, chauffeur for Mr. Taylor, and
from information obtained by the officers from the two men, who knew intimate
details of the slain film man's life, the officers obtained important tips.
     The most significant part of the new statement made by Peavey yesterday
was that Taylor left the house on a mysterious call Wednesday afternoon,
leaving the automobile behind.
     "Mr. Taylor left the house about 5 o'clock, saying he wanted to walk,
and leaving strict orders not to answer any telephone inquiries to the house
with one exception," said Peavey.
     "He said that if Miss Normand called to tell her he would be back after
6 o'clock, but instructed me to tell everyone else he was out and that I did
not know where he was or when he would be back."
     From the few papers and documents obtained by them at the Taylor flat,
the officers working on the case yesterday sought to glean, if possible, some
clew as to where Taylor went when he left the house Wednesday afternoon.
     Names and addresses, recorded by Mr. Taylor, of a number of well-known
persons in the film world and in business circles here are in the possession
of the police, and a thorough check of these will be made in an effort to
trace accurately and completely every movement of the slain film director on
the days before his murder.

                                                            LOS ANGELES TIMES
                            Hunt for Luxurious Car
                                       
     What may prove to be an important clew in the hunt for the murderer of
William D. Taylor was placed before the police last night in a report that a
large automobile of striking appearance was seen in the vicinity of the
Taylor home the night of the slaying.
     This automobile, according to the reports to the police, was an
expensive car painted a chocolate-brown shade.
     The automobile, according to the reports, was seen to drive up to the
Taylor home late in the afternoon and remain there for some time.  It left
the corner of Alvarado and Maryland streets a few minutes after the
automobile of Miss Mabel Normand drove up.
     A peculiar part of this episode is a conflicting report from another
source that an automobile described as a closed car, dark green in color, was
the vehicle in question.  The time and location given in the two reports
check in every detail, but the make of car and color of the bodies are
different.
     "We are going to check every possible angle of this case," Detective
Sergeant Herman Cline said yesterday.  "There are a great many conflicting
reports given us and for the first few days it is a large task to distinguish
the important from what has no connection with the case.  If we can verify
certain facts laid before us in connection with this murder, then the
description of these two cars will become very important."
     This is the only comment the officers on the case would make on this
phase of the investigation.
     The importance of the clew about the automobile described is that the
police believe they may be able to trace the owners and from them learn
either of visits to Mr. Taylor's apartment or about persons seen loitering in
the vicinity of the place.

                             Taylor Home is Mapped
              District Attorney Swings into Action in Death Case
                           Many Theories Entertained
                                       
     The District Attorney's office swung into action yesterday in an attempt
to solve the mystery of the murder of William Desmond Taylor and also to lay
a foundation for future prosecution in the event the slayer is captured.
     At the same time the police searched Mr. Taylor's apartments at 404-B
South Alvarado street, and took charge of letters, papers and documents that
might serve to thrown some light on the slain film director's affairs.
     Chief Dep. Dist.-Atty. Doran and Investigator Contreras made a thorough
search of the apartments, and canvass of the vicinity.  Albert E. Timmons of
the County Surveyor's office and two assistants, P. W. Atkins and R. B.
Heuer, drew plans of each room and the territory contiguous to the residence.
     Detective Sergeants Herman W. Cline, Winn and Murphy, represented the
police department in the search of the premises.  Papers belonging to Mr.
Taylor were taken to Central Police Station and carefully examined.
     The arrangement of the furniture in the room where the fatal shot was
fired was not disturbed, as the officers stated a careful scrutiny would be
made for possible finger prints.  This phase of the investigation applies
particularly in the chair in which Mr. Taylor was possibly sitting when shot,
and which was found turned over across his legs.
     Mr. Taylor's apartments were tastefully furnished.  There were books in
profusion, mostly of a philosophical and sociological trend, numerous
photographs of persons in the motion-picture colony, relics of the war, and
much art work and bric-a-brac.
     The police yesterday questioned four persons found by The Times who had
seen a man believed to be the slayer go to the Taylor residence before the
shooting and leave the vicinity a few minutes after the bullet had been
fired.
     The time of the murder has been fixed by police at between 7:49 and 8:15
p.m. Wednesday.  L. A. Grant and Floyd Hartley, service station men, at Sixth
and Alvarado streets, stated that a man had inquired of them where W. D.
Taylor lived shortly before 6 o'clock.  They directed him to the Alvarado
street address, and he left.
     The description of this man corresponds with that of a man who boarded
an inbound West First-street car at the Maryland-avenue stop, at either 7:54
or 8:25 p.m.  Motorman R. S. Woodward and Conductor E. W. Dascomb took notice
of the passenger because it was the first stop they had made on Maryland
street for months.
     The man was described by these four persons as about five feet and nine
or ten inches tall, 26 or 27 years old and weighing between 155 and 165
pounds.  He had dark hair and wore a dark suit and either a light hat or cap.
     ...Floyd Hartley yesterday was unable to identify a picture of Sands as
the man who inquired at the oil station.  He was inclined to think they were
different individuals, but was not positive.
     While the revenge and jealousy theories appear to be the most plausible
thus far in the investigation the police are not overlooking the possibility
of a blackmail angle.
     This factor is being probed by detectives detailed to the case.  It is
considered possible that the slayer attempted to extort money from Mr. Taylor
and when refused or threatened with arrest, he shot to kill.  An open
checkbook on Mr. Taylor's writing desk and a pen with fresh ink on it might
be considered part of a ruse by Mr. Taylor to "stall off" the murderer until
the police could be advised.
     The story that a woman is involved in the slaying--supplying the motive
of jealousy--is seriously entertained by the police.  Although the slain man
led a fairly studious life it is known that he had a wide circle of women
acquaintances and that some of them were visitors to his home.  An enraged
suitor who had been discarded might very easily have carried out this plan,
it is believed, to eliminate Mr. Taylor as a rival.
     In order to ferret out a revenge motive, for some real or fancied wrong,
the police say they will have to trace back the incidents in Mr. Taylor's
life.  He led a varied and exciting career that took him to many out-of-the-
way places of the globe.  Investigators feel confident that he must have
incurred some bitter enmity during his activities and travels.

                      Girl's Devotion to Father Evidenced
                                       
     Mute evidence of the tender affection which existed between Ethel Daisy
Taylor, 14-year-old daughter of the slain film director, William Desmond
Taylor, and her father, was found by The Examiner yesterday.  Inscribed on a
page and a half of note paper, written in typical school girl chatter, it
bears every evidence of the strong devotion that undoubtedly existed.
Postmark Mamaroneck, N. Y., and dated February 6, 1921, the letter reads:
"Dear Father of Mine:
     "Excuse the weird paper, but I am having some made and haven't gotten it
as yet.  I like your paper very much and am always glad when I hear from you.
     "I have read your letters over ever and ever so many times until I
almost know them by heart.  I would have answered sooner, only I have had a
siege of infected fingers.  Three, one right after the other, and have only
just gotten through with them.
     "Of course, that made it rather difficult to write or draw, so I stayed
home a couple of the days.  I had one of the fingers cut four times, but the
others only once.
     "Mercy goodness, I wish you didn't have to work so long.  You'll wear
yourself down again, so be careful, won't you, Papa, pettie dear?  Will the
picture with Miss Compton be interesting?  I do wish I might see you soon.  
I think of you so much it seems as if I saw you much more often than every
once in a while.
     "I realize how seldom we really see each other and I surely do hope
you'll be East again soon, dear.  I'd like very much to send you some real
nice things for Christmas, but haven't the least idea what you would like, so
kindly tell me, please, dear.
     "I must stop now.  Oh, Father, dear, I do love you so much.
          "Ethel."

     The names of two film actresses were injected last night into the
investigation of the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery.
     One is a star of national reputation.  The other is a girl of humbler
station in motion picture ranks.
     While detectives working on the case refused to confirm the above
mentioned facts it was learned from other sources that investigation had
disclosed a close association between Taylor and these two screen actresses.
     Of almost equal interest in the development of the investigation was
the statement of Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of Taylor's chauffeur, that she saw
Edward F. Sands, ex-secretary-valet of the murdered director, now sought as a
witness, at Sixth and Figueroa Streets Tuesday afternoon last [the day prior
to the murder] at 1:20 o'clock.
     Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany were subjected to a long examination last night,
during which she revealed what the investigators [regard] as one of the most
important clews yet to come before them.
     In regard to the screen actresses, the police refused to make any
mention of their names or to discuss what part they are alleged to have
played in the mystery.
     Until a late hour last night police detectives questioned Harry Fellows,
Taylor's assistant director.  They are said to regard Fellows as one of the
vital witnesses in the case because of his close contact with Taylor for many
months.  The questioning last night, they said, was for the purpose of
checking over Taylor's movements for three days preceding his murder.
     The search for Sands continued with unabated intensity. He is said to
have returned to Los Angeles Tuesday and uttered this threat:
     "I am here to get Bill Taylor."
     His intimate knowledge of Taylor's double identity was revealed in
startling fashion late yesterday when in Fresno it was learned that Sands had
there pawned jewelry stolen from Taylor and that he had given the name
"William Deane-Tanner," asserted to be Taylor's true name.
     The jewelry upon which a loan had been made and a ticket issued
consisted of a pair of cuff links set with diamonds and onyx shirt studs,
also set with diamonds.
     The man who secured the loan answered the description of Sands.
     In a bold hand he wrote on the ticket retained by the broker the name of
his one-time employer, "William Deane Tanner."
     The meaning of this might have remained impenetrable, something as deep
as the shadows as all else that concerns the silent figure whose tragic end
left the motion picture world aghast and stunned.
     But by some means, possibly by reading his mail, it is believed, and
learning the details of the allowances sent to his daughter, Sands became
possessed of the secret.
     It may be said, parenthetically, that no member of the picture colony
believes the change in name was for any purpose of concealment.
     Taylor (and that name will be used as most accurate) said not long ago
to a friend, "I have known great sadness in my life."
     It is believed that the "Tanner" was discarded along with the old life
which he had described as being so unhappy.
     The police are assured beyond peradventure that the man who pawned the
jewelry in Fresno, using the true name of the owner in a spirit of malicious
triumph, was Edward Sands.
     There is something in this very circumstance which to the officers is
itself a flood of light coming out of the darkness.
     The stealing and forgery indulged in by Sands did not convey the spirit
of this piece of treachery; they might have been only for gain. But now that
the Fresno episode is brought up from the obscurity of a dark little hole-in-
the-wall pawn shop to be made plain in all its details, a new element
appears.
     This new element is the pronounced unfriendliness of Sands, which takes
on the aspect of a sinister and silent threat.
     The malice is further revealed in what seems to have been a persistent
campaign of Sands to annoy the director.
     From Fresno he sent him a pawn ticket, a ticket issued on valuables
stolen from Taylor on which money had been raised.
     Still another pawn ticket came through the mail from Sacramento. With
this was the letter signed "Alias Jimmy V."
     These were derisive thrusts at Taylor; from some motive which has not
been revealed the thief and forger was trying to torture the victim of his
crimes.
     Chief of Police Frank Truex of Fresno, who found the pawned jewelry,
learned that other articles stolen from Taylor and not recovered were pledged
in Sacramento.
     It was disclosed yesterday that Mabel Normand recently made Taylor a
present of a black amber cigarette holder valued at $1800.  This is said to
be one of the finest things of its kind ever made.
     In return Taylor gave Miss Normand a dresser set costing $1200.
     ..."We are satisfied that we have everything checked up to 8 o'clock on
the night of the murder.
     "The man who killed William D. Taylor is the one who was seen leaving
his apartment shortly before that time Wednesday night.  This is our absolute
conclusion.
     "We also have a definite clew as to who the man is and his motive.  But
to reveal either, would be to prevent clear and straightaway police work upon
our hypothesis."
     This was the statement last night of Captain of Detectives David L.
Adams, after receiving reports from his staff of detectives who yesterday
were combing through a multitude of rumors for something substantial.
     Sands, whose true name, The Examiner yesterday learned, is Edward Fitz
Strathmore, wanted for desertion from the Army as well as for the robberies
committed against Taylor, was seen in Los Angeles Tuesday.
     Hunted as a fugitive by both Federal and State officers, he nevertheless
ran the gauntlet, appearing, it is said, without attempt at concealment
either of his person or his plan.
     It is the latter which particularly interests the police.  To a man who
has given a detailed report of the conversation Sands is said to have
threatened, with a curse, "I'm here to get Bill Taylor."
     Included among the persons who saw Sands on Tuesday are women whose
testimony will probably be of the utmost importance if he is apprehended.
     One of these is said to have seen him Wednesday night near the scene of
the crime.  Her identity is being kept secret.
     There are so many fingers pointing at this man that the police have
centered their efforts  upon finding him.
     With the little light as to the relations between Taylor and Sands it is
admittedly difficult to reconstruct the tragedy upon the basis merely of the
discharged man's enmity growing out of Taylor's felony complaint against him.
     Hence, as a working theory, it is presumed that there may have been a
much deeper motive underlying the act.
     That Taylor was not shot in the back, as at first reported, but in the
left side, was yesterday discovered by Detectives Cato and Cahill, who
minutely examined the wound.
     The single bullet entered at a point where the left elbow would rest if
the arm were held naturally at the side.
     It might seem, therefore, that Taylor, hearing a noise in his room,
turned from his writing desk where he was going over the stubs of his check
book, and was shot on the moment he discovered the intruder.
     ...There is, however, a great mass of material upon which the police are
checking, hoping that from the pile of chaff there may be found the single
grain of information which, it is hoped, may germinate into the full
disclosure of the dastardly act and all of its ramifications.
     Theodore Kosloff, the dancer, contributed one of these stories.
     Some two weeks ago he was with Taylor "on location," a place in the
country.  They were walking together.  Suddenly from behind a clump of brush
a man arose almost with a spring.
     Quicker than this surprising stranger, said Kosloff, was Taylor.  He
leaped around to one side and faced the man.
     They stood eye to eye for a moment, neither speaking.  Then the man
turned and walked away.  Taylor, vouchsafing no explanation, continued the
interrupted conversation.
     This unaccountable happening came to Mr. Kosloff's mind yesterday when
he learned of his friend's violent end.  But aside from relating the peculiar
circumstances he could add nothing.
     ...Something of the description of this man was learned yesterday by The
Examiner from A. A. Tomlinson, an accountant of 1022 West Fortieth Place.
     "The true name of this man," said Tomlinson, "is not Sands but
Strathmore. I recognized him by his picture in this morning's Examiner.
     "He enlisted in the army during the war as Edward Fitz Strathmore and
was assigned to Columbus Barracks, Ohio. I was then head of the finance
office and upon learning that Strathmore had been a chief petty officer in
the navy I asked that he be transferred to my department, which was done.
     "On October 4, 1919, Strathmore forged my name to a Government check for
$475 and tried to buy a motorcycle with it. He failed to carry out this
scheme, but escaped. At the same time he forged the commanding officer's name
to a discharge. He has been wanted for desertion.
     "On July 4, 1920, I met him on Alvarado Street. He told me that he was
expecting to get work with the street car company. I notified the police, but
he disappeared.
     "During his service with me at Columbus Barracks, Strathmore often
boasted of the crimes he had committed. I did not believe him then, but
thought it was a case of a young fellow drawing on his imagination.
     "Once I asked him what he would do if he were in a dangerous situation.
He said he would shoot his way out.
     "Strathmore gave me a number of books, all bearing his signature on the
inside of the cover.  In each case the 'Strathmore' was written over a name
which had been erased.  In one of them I was able to make out that the erased
name was 'Sands.'
     "Among the volumes is one bearing, in Strathmore's handwriting, the
entry, 'c-o Perry P. Le Berthon, 982 Fifty-second street, Brooklyn, N. Y."
     The Examiner wired to Columbus barracks for a description of Strathmore
and received the following:
     "Dark complexion, ruddy face, height 5 feet 5 3/4 inches, slightly bow-
legged."
     Strathmore, or Sands, is a constant cigarette smoker.
     ...Recently, it was learned, Taylor had attended two or three "hop"
parties where all but he had either smoked opium or taken a drug in some
form.  He was there, it was assumed, to get "atmosphere" for a picture.  The
possibility that the beginning of the tragedy had its setting at one of these
proscribed affairs is being considered.
     ...The many friends of Taylor in the motion picture colony found it
inconceivable, they said, that he should have been mixed up with a woman,
particularly in such a way as to incur some one's mortal hostility.

                   He Had No Enemies, Says Former Sweetheart
                                       
     Neva Gerber, petite and beautiful film star, who at one time was engaged
to marry William D. Taylor, but who broke off the match because she said both
believed it unsuitable, said last night:
     "I have never known a finer, better man than Mr. Taylor.  He was the
soul of honor, a man of exceptional culture, education and refinement, but
possessing a reserve which very few were permitted to penetrate.
     "So far as I know, he did not have an enemy in the world, although he
had mentioned casually of fights he had on his various trips to the Klondike.
     "He had led a most eventful life, and told me, on one occasion, of being
in a village in the far north when it was scourged by smallpox.  He went
about nursing the inhabitants, including a priest.  The epidemic was a severe
one, and practically every one was stricken, or had fled to escape this pest.
Finally he and the priest, I think it was, were the only two left.  The
priest had fallen a victim, but Mr. Taylor nursed him back to health.
     "Then Mr. Taylor fell victim to the disease, and, after a hard battle,
the priest nursed him back to health.
     "In spite of this experience, he often said to me that he longed for the
far north with its great open stretches, its mighty mountains, and the
solitude of its hills and valleys.  Often when he was nervous and tired from
directing a picture he would tell me that he longed again to be going over
the trail in search of gold, and far from the distractions of civilization.
     "He told me that he made two fortunes, and spent both of them on his
return from Alaska.
     "Before the war he frequently received letters from his mother who was
then in London, and his daughter, who I believe was then about 11 years old.
His mother, I understood, was killed in an air raid on the British capital.
     "He always spoke of his daughter as 'the child,' and was planning, about
two years ago, to bring her to Los Angeles to live.  It is my understanding
that his former wife is now living in New York.
     "I always assumed he was divorced, for had he not been, I do not believe
he would have asked me to marry him.  We were engaged for some time, but we
finally came to the conclusion we were not suited to one another, so the
prospective match was broken off about two years ago.
     This terrible affair is all the more mysterious because it was a common
saying among the studios and in Hollywood generally that Mr. Taylor had not
an enemy in the world.
     "He may have made an enemy in the past who nursed a grudge through the
years which finally resulted in this murder, but he never gave the slightest
indication to me of having any foes."

     Los Angeles, Feb. 3--Mabel Normand, one of the last persons to see
William D. Taylor alive when she visited his Alvarado street home Wednesday
evening to borrow a book on philosophy, denied emphatically today that she
was or ever had been engaged to Taylor.  "We were pals of the golf course,
fellow students in French and both enjoyed delving into philosophical
subjects--that was my relation with Mr. Taylor.  Just pals," she said.
     Miss Normand was recovering this afternoon from a nervous collapse which
she suffered when told of Taylor's murder.
     "I wish to deny also the statement attributed to me that Mr. Taylor had
told me of premonition of his death," added Miss Normand.
     "I never heard him mention any fear for his life or fear of any person
or persons.
     "Although we were good pals and had many interests in common, I was so
slightly acquainted with his personal affairs that not until I read it in the
papers did I know that Mr. Taylor had a daughter."...

     Mary Miles Minter, motion picture star, who said she had always
considered him the "most perfect man" and who was one of the first to call at
the Taylor residence after the murder became known, said:
     "It is ridiculous for any one to intimate that Mr. Taylor and I were
ever interested in each other in a sentimental way.
     "I have known Mr. Taylor since I was a little girl.  He has directed me
in some of my best pictures and I have always loved and admired him almost as
one would a father.
     "Immediately after mother told me of his murder we hurried to his home.
I have often been there with my mother or grandmother and when I came fact to
face with Henry, his colored servant, I burst into tears yesterday.
     "One newspaper said I had hysterics," continued Miss Minter.  "Perhaps I
did.  Mr. Taylor was an old friend of the family and I have known him ever
since I was a child playing child parts.
     "I used so often to call Henry, his faithful servant, over the telephone
and ask him if Mr. Taylor had remembered to eat his dinner, or to tell him to
be sure that Mr. Taylor had plenty of covers on his bed, as it was a cold
night.
     "As far as I know, Mr. Taylor was never married.
     "I do not believe that he was engaged to Mabel Normand.  Miss Normand
and myself are very good friends and I am sure I would have known had they
been planning to marry.  I think that Mr. Taylor found Miss Normand a lovable
and rather boyish pal and that was all there was to it.
     "For the last three and a half years I have known Mr. Taylor very well,
although during the last five months or so I have scarcely seen him, having
been so busy with my work.
     He directed me in 'Anne of Green Gables,' Judy of Rogues Hollow' [sic],
'Nurse Marjorie,' and 'Jenny be Good.'
     "Mr. Taylor was always the man we all pointed to when any one asked us
to name a representative man of the profession.
     "No, I never heard him mention having any fear of any one, and I am
positive he had no premonition of trouble.
     "I have wept hours since his death and I expect to weep a great deal
more.  For Mr. Taylor was one of the most splendid and fine men that I ever
expect to know."

     Los Angeles, Feb. 3--The dainty figure of Miss Claire Windsor, moving
picture actress, was rudely thrust today into the weird mystery in the murder
of William Desmond Taylor.
     A week ago Wednesday night Mr. Taylor and a prominent moving picture
star called at the home of Miss Windsor's mother, Mrs. G. E. Cronk, in Third
avenue, and asked to take Claire to a party at the Ambassador hotel.  Claire
went.
     It is said that Taylor some few days later took Miss Windsor to another
party and that nothing was heard of her again until yesterday morning, some
hours after Taylor was found dead.
     Just what connection there may be between the murder and Miss Windsor's
unexplained disappearance from home, if there be any connection, could not be
learned.  Mrs. Cronk could give no explanation.
     There has been no effort on the part of the police, as yet, to get in
touch with Miss Windsor.

     Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...Howard Fellows, chauffeur, employed by Taylor,
and Henry Peavey, negro servant in the Taylor home, were closely questioned
by the police today.  As a result of the inquiry the police say they
definitely fixed the time of the slaying at about 8 o'clock Wednesday night.
     According to Fellows, he appeared at the Taylor home at 7:45 o'clock and
rapped at the front door to summon his employer.  The lights were burning, he
said, but there was no response to his summons.  Fifteen minutes later, he
said, he tried to raise Taylor on a telephone without success.  Peavey's
story to the police today was the same as that he told after the body of
Taylor was found.

     ...After making the most thorough investigation, questioning every man,
woman and child living in the nine double residences that constitute the
court not one had seen or heard anything out of the ordinary except Mrs.
Douglas MacLean, who has already told her story and Mrs. C. F. Reddick, who
thought she heard a shot some time in the night between 1 and 3 o'clock, but
who said yesterday she was not even sure it was a pistol shot now.
     "I was awakened by some sharp, sudden report," said Mrs. Reddick, "but I
have so frequently heard almost the identical sound made by an automobile
that I could not say positively what it was, nor could I be sure of the time.
I do know, however, that it was quite late, because I sat in my living room
almost exactly opposite Mr. Taylor's front door, reading until very late and
heard nothing like a shot the entire evening."
     Mrs. Myrtle B. Pratt, who lives at the entrance to the court, says she
saw no suspicious character either entering or leaving the place and that she
had heard no unusual sound of any description.
     Mrs. J. K. Lawrence, who also lives at the Alvarado street entrance,
said:
     "There are so many automobiles passing here all of the time and their
back-fire explosions are so similar to a pistol shot that we have gotten so
we pay no attention to them whatever.  I have no recollection of hearing
anything that sounded like a shot at any particular time during the evening
in which the shooting occurred, but I might have heard a dozen such sounds
without feeling the slightest alarm.  I think every occupant of the court
should try to recollect anything he or she saw which might in any way throw
light on the event."
     Mrs. Charles Cooley, living two doors from the Taylor residence, said
that she and her husband were sitting in their living room reading almost the
entire evening and did not hear a sound.  They had their blinds drawn and had
no occasion to look out, so saw no one.
     Mrs. Arthur W. Watchter, stated that she and her husband were out for
the evening and returned late, but that they did not notice lights burning
anywhere.  Both she and Mrs. Cooley voiced the idea that people were entirely
too unobservant of things going on around them, and Mrs. Cooley said:
     "When I think that such a kind, fine man as Mr. Taylor is said to have
been, was right here helpless, at the mercy of a fiendish murderer when some
of us might have gone to his aid and saved him, and we only known what was
going on.  It seems that we all live too much to ourselves and that there
ought to be some better mode of communication between us all.

     An excellent example of habitual observation was brought to light
yesterday when Mrs. Ida Garrow, a modiste living at the Rose of Sharon
apartments, told Examiner investigators that on Wednesday night as she was
walking down Ocean View avenue, at the intersection of Alvarado street, she
noticed a man acting in a very peculiar manner.
     "It was about eight thirty, or possibly twenty minutes of nine, said
Mrs. Garrow yesterday, "Wednesday evening and I was hurrying to my club which
meets at the corner of Grand View and Ocean View avenues.  I was late for a
class that is studying Hebrew which I did not want to miss, but as I have
trained my observational faculties in the study of astrology it is without
voluntary effort that I perceive whatever comes within the range of vision.
     "As I came to Alvarado street, I saw a tall, slender, smooth shaven
policeman, whose face I would instantly recognize if I were to see him again,
walking toward Ocean View avenue.  Walking with him was another man, to whom
I did not pay any particular attention, because my curiosity was aroused by
the peculiar actions of a man who was coming toward me a few feet in front of
the policeman.  Although the policeman was not paying the slightest attention
to this man, the man was glancing back apprehensively over his shoulder, and
at times looking in, away from the street, which would be directly in toward
the court where the body of Mr. Taylor was found.
     "As the policeman got closer to this man, the man crossed the street,
and I noticed as he crossed that he was short and stout and wore a long
overcoat, but there was the shadow of a building falling at such an angle
that I could not determine whether he wore a cap or a hat."
     Who was the policeman walking down Alvarado street at 8:30 or 8:45, and
what did he see?  This slight clue given by a careful observer may lead to
very important developments in the mysterious murder, whose points are still
baffling the keenest detectives of the city.

                    Taylor Made Death Threat, Says Actress
                                       
     Claire Windsor, beautiful motion-picture star, last night added a
sensation to the mystery of the slaying of William D. Taylor, the popular
picture director.
     She asserted that she had heard the dead motion picture director declare
that "he would kill Sands, the former valet, if he ever laid his hands on
him."
     "Mr. Taylor, Tony Moreno and Betty Francisco were at the Ambassador
Hotel at a party on Thursday night one week ago when Maurice, the famous
dancer, first gave his exhibition," said the film actress.
     "Mr. Taylor was with me, and of course we talked about the robbery.
     "He said: 'If I ever lay my hands on Sands I will kill him.'
     "Mr. Taylor seemed very determined because Sands had robbed him of every
cent he had at the time.
     Speaking of her friendship with Taylor, whom she referred to in terms of
the greatest respect, Miss Windsor said that she had known him a long time
but never very well.  "I always found him a perfect gentleman, always
considerate of others and most polished," she said.
     "While I never worked under the direction of Mr. Taylor, I met him a
number of times.  Mr. Taylor made no secret of his plan to kill his valet, as
he told a number of people that he would kill him if he ever got his hands on
him."
     Pretty Betty Francisco, the little blonde motion picture star, yesterday
told of the party she attended at the Ambassador Hotel when Antonio Moreno
was her escort and the late picture director was the companion of Claire
Windsor.
     She referred to the slaying of Taylor with horror.
     "I did not know him intimately enough to call him a friend, but I would
be proud to call a man like him my friend.  I was rather an acquaintance, and
not fortunate enough to be a friend.
     "It has been stated that I was with Mr. Taylor at the Ambassador Hotel.
This, however, is not true.  I was at the hotel with Mr. and Mrs. Bryant
Washburn.  Mr. Moreno and Miss Claire Windsor also were at the Ambassador,
but I did not see Mr. Taylor.
     "I never recall his speaking of any trouble he had with any one, but on
one occasion he spoke of a servant of his who was taken ill with
tuberculoses.  He felt very badly about it.  This must have been nearly two
years ago.
     Last night at the home of Claire Windsor, 1042 Third avenue, the mother
of the film actress told of the many books Taylor had recommended to her
daughter to read.

     Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...The women attracting most interest from
investigators now are Mabel Normand, Mary Miles Minter, Claire Windsor and
Mrs. Clara Crawford Ivers [sic].  He was a close friend to all of them.  In
addition he was known as a man who fascinated women.  The police, therefore,
are seeking not only the actual slayer, but the person behind the slayer, if
two were involved.

                    Says Mabel Normand Was to Marry Taylor
                                       
     Despite her denial of a love affair with William D. Taylor, a close
friend of both Mabel Normand and the slain man said yesterday that Miss
Normand had been engaged to the director.  While nothing definite had been
settled it was generally understood, according to this source, that they were
to marry.
     "Of course, Miss Normand was much sought after by young men in Los
Angeles," said this informant.  "But I'm quite sure none of these affairs was
serious.  Miss Normand simply would have a pleasant evening with one of them
at a dance or a party, and promptly forget all about it.  If the young man
called her by telephone afterward, as likely as not she'd wonder where she'd
ever heard his name before.
     "Some one of these young men might have resented her acquaintance with
Taylor.  It's hard to say.  I never heard of anything that might lead one to
think some woman was jealous of his friendship for her."
     Another report brought forward in motion picture circles here was that
the director and Miss Normand had feared trouble of some sort and that they
had made plans secretly to have a wedding to head it off...
     The report that Taylor had been engaged to Mary Miles Minter was scouted
by her friends here.  For one thing, it was pointed out that her recent
reported engagement to Thomas E. Dixon, son of a pencil manufacturer, seemed
much more substantial than any of the romantic affairs in which Miss Minter
has been mentioned, and that this engagement was denied emphatically by both
the youthful star and her mother, Mrs. Shelby.

     Maigne is a close friend of Mabel Normand, and was with her yesterday
when she received newspaper men who sought her story of her call at Taylor's
home Wednesday evening.

     Los Angeles, Feb. 3--...Police are also seeking a man, said to be a New
York broker, the friend of a movie actress, whose name they will not reveal.
He came here from the East, they say, shortly after the actress came.
     ...The figure of Miss Claire Windsor, moving picture actress, was rudely
thrust into the mystery yesterday.
     A week ago Wednesday night Mr. Taylor and a prominent moving picture
star called at the home of Miss Windsor's mother, Mrs. G. E. Cronk, and asked
to take Claire to a party at the Ambassador Hotel.  Claire went.
     It is declared that Taylor some few days later took Miss Windsor to
another party and that nothing was heard of her again until yesterday
morning, some hours after Taylor was found cold and stiff in his luxurious
apartment, a bullet hole in his body.
     Miss Windsor could not be found today.  Her mother said she was "out on
location" with Marshall Neilan, a director.  At the office of the director
this was denied.  Neilan, it was said, was on location, but not Miss Windsor.
Just what connection there may be between the murder and Miss Windsor's
unexplained disappearance, if there be any connection, could not be learned.
Mrs. Cronk could give no explanation.
     "My daughter knew Mr. Taylor," said Mrs. Cronk tonight.  "But the first
time she ever went out with him was a week ago Wednesday night.
     "Mr. Taylor came with an actor whom I do not know.  I thought nothing of
it, for a long time ago Mr. Taylor was her director, and, besides, Claire
goes out to dinner parties and dances nearly every night.  The ways of the
movies are queer and not for me to ask questions about.
     "I had not seen Claire since Sunday--not until this morning--but I
thought nothing of that either.  You see, she has a little boy three years
old and he disturbs her when she sleeps at home.  So she had a couch put in
at her studio and she sleeps there in peace and no baby crying to wake her
up.
     "When she didn't come back, I wasn't particularly worried.  I thought
she was at the studio.  She got home this morning and said to me, 'Isn't it
too bad.  Mr. Taylor has been murdered.  Such a nice man.'  Then she left to
go out somewhere on location."
     There has been no effort on the part of the police as yet to get in
touch with Miss Windsor; but every effort is being made to learn everything
possible about Taylor, his life, his friends and his enemies.
     All Hollywood is being raked; all the queer meeting places of the movie
actors and actresses, directors and assistant directors, cameramen and extras-
-restaurants, beauty parlors, dens where opium and marihuana and other
strange drugs are common, dens where men and women dress in silk kimonos and
sit in circles and drink odd drinks--are being visited.
     Everyone who has come into contact with the slain director, no matter
how remotely, is being questioned.  Things that may shock the world of moving
picture fans, are destined to come out of the mystery, it is said.  Peculiar
stars, male and female, may be scorched and smirched before the police
investigation is over.  And all the sins of the cinema colony will be made
known.  Dope fiends will figure in the tale before it is all told and strange
effeminate men and peculiarly masculine women.
     The police are working now on two theories.  One is that a beautiful
woman is in back of the affair, someone of the hundreds of beautiful women of
the studio world.  Perhaps she was a woman scorned, or the sweetheart of
another man, perhaps--but there are many motives and the police have not yet
decided on any.
     The other theory is that an enemy made in that mysterious part of the
dead man's life, which he so well kept from his friends in Hollywood, was the
murderer.
     It is almost certain that a man committed the murder.  A man was seen
before and after the shot was heard, according to Mr. and Mrs. Douglas
MacLean, who live in the same court of apartments, and the other witnesses.
And the shot that ended Taylor's life came from a .38 weapon, a gun deemed
too big for a woman to carry.  The man is presumed to have entered the Taylor
apartment while Taylor was escorting Mabel Normand to her automobile, bidding
her goodby.
     The shot came a few minutes after Taylor re-entered the house.  There
was no attempt at robbery.  Taylor's pockets had not been emptied.  His
jewels had not been touched.  Not a drawer in the four rooms had been opened.
If the intruder had meant to rob, he shot too quickly and became frightened
and fled.
     Yet, according to the MacLeans, the man who came out of the front door
of the Taylor apartment just after the shot--a tall man, roughly dressed,
with cap pulled down on his head and a muffler around his neck--showed no
signs of fright.  He stood in the doorway and looked back, then departed--in
such a way that no suspicion was aroused in the minds of those who saw him.
A thief fleeing in terror after a murder would not act that way, the police
assert.
     There are too many strange incidents connected with the affair also, the
police say, to admit of the theory that a bungling burglar fired the shot.
     There have been many mysterious telephone calls, according to the negro
man servant and cook, Harry [sic] Peavey.  The phone would ring and no one
would answer.  Was it someone who merely wished to be satisfied that Taylor
was at home?...
     The detectives are still searching for Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former
secretary, who is said to have departed from the household some time ago
while Taylor was abroad, taking with him numerous trinkets, also the Taylor
motor and some forged checks.
     A peculiar thing in the minds of the police is that both Sands and
Peavey are of a queer type, affected, given to feminine ways.  Peavey was
placed under arrest a few days ago and serious charges were made against
him...
     Taylor, fifty years old, supposed to be a bachelor, lived in a cozy four-
room apartment with his man servant, Harry [sic] Peavey, a queer chap, with a
high, squeaky voice, a man arrested a few days ago charged with a serious
offense.
     Peavey was proud of his cooking; he made the finest rice pudding to be
had in Hollywood.  And he liked to crochet doilies and scarfs and things.
     Taylor lived alone with his books and his pictures and with Peavey.
Howard Fellows, a likable young chap, drove the big automobile.
     ...He loved jewelry, had lots of it.  Perhaps the chain diamond ring,
valued at $2,500 is best known to his friends.  There was perhaps $20,000
worth of jewels in the apartment when Taylor was killed.
     His friends described him as witty, the girls say he loved to tease
them.
     Recently, say his friends, he had been visiting the queer places in Los
Angeles, where guests are served with marihuana and opium and morphine, where
the drugs are wheeled in on tea carts, and strange things happen.
     "It is not odd," they say, "he was looking for color."
