                         The Case Against Thomas Dixon
                                       
If the early press reports are to be believed, Thomas Dixon was once a prime
suspect in the murder of Taylor, but he was soon overshadowed by a flood of
other suspects. When director King Vidor gained access to the police file in
the mid-1960s, it appears that any references to Dixon had long been purged
from the files, except for the one reference in Mary Miles Minter's official
statement. Following, in chronological order, are some press items which
refer to Dixon, linking him with Mary Miles Minter prior to Taylor's murder,
or suggesting his involvement in murder.

                                                            LOS ANGELES TIMES
     A romance of interest to filmdom and the public, soon to be consummated
in marriage, if all reports are to be believed, is that between Mary Miles
Minter, Lasky star, and T. E. Dixon, son of the lead-pencil king.
     Mr. Dixon has just arrived in the city and is a guest at the Ambassador.
Asked concerning the romance he did not deny the engagement.  Miss Minter
herself, when she came from a visit to New York so long ago as a year ago
last summer, admitted to a TIMES representative she was engaged to Mr. Dixon.
     At that time she said business matters connected with her film work
caused her to desire to keep the engagement a secret, but she showed a
handsome diamond and ruby ring, the gift of her fiance.  Mr. Dixon said
yesterday that business had brought him West.
     ...Miss Minter met Mr. Dixon when on a visit to New York.

     The pretty blonde motion picture star, Mary Miles Minter, has been
engaged so many times to various millionaires that when we hear a rumor
circulated that the knot has at last been tied we are prone to look upon it
as another publicity stunt issued by the overactive brain of a hard-working
press agent.
     The gentlemanly bridegroom in the present case happens to be Thomas E.
Dixon, son of a millionaire pencil manufacturer.  The rumor says that at a
Christmas party held in Hollywood, Cal, the young couple evaded their friends
and ran off, to be married.
     The mother of Miss Minter, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, left New York for the
Coast December 28, and before going she is quoted as saying that she knew her
daughter was engaged to Mr. Dixon, but that she did not believe there was any
truth in the report of her sudden marriage.
     ...Mr. Dixon is 27, a Yale graduate, and was a captain in the Aviation
Corps during the war.  He makes his headquarters at the Yale Club in New York
City, but left for California three weeks ago.

     Mary Miles Minter, film star, and Tommy Dixon, heir to the Dixon lead-
pencil millions, denied their engagement in concert last night.
     "People are continually announcing engagements for me that I know
nothing whatever about," said Miss Minter.  "Tommy and I are just good
friends, aren't we Tommy?" and Tommy nodded his head mechanically like a
reluctant little boy who had been coached against his will.

took place on Jan. 7, 1922)
Among those present were:...Mary Miles Minter, Thomas Dixon...
     ...Although Mary Miles Minter says she is not engaged to Thomas Dixon,
son of the leading pencil manufacturer, she evidently finds him an ideal
escort.  And her mother doesn't object to having the young folks slip away to
the movies in the evening.

(from an interview with Mary Miles Minter on the movie set) ..."It's the
first time he [Dixon] has been here in two weeks," Miss Minter said.  "I
would like for the world to know that Mr. Dixon is a very dear friend--a
charming fellow--a wonderful acquaintance, but he is not my affiance.
     "...I have known Mr. Dixon for five years.
     "I met him in 1917, when I was touring around trying to do my little bit
in Liberty Loan campaigns.
     "Since that time we have been the best of friends.  About one year ago
we became engaged--but it was a conditional engagement.  We kept it secret
for that reason.
    "When Mr. Dixon came to California during the holidays the engagement was
called off, despite rumors to the contrary.  And that's all.
     "I have not seen much of him recently, and it is by the merest
coincidence that he is visiting in the studio today.
     "I regard him as a friend.  But I do not love him.  And, until I love
someone, I will never marry.
     "That's the true story of my romance, if romance it has been.  To me,
however, it has just been a dear, sweet friendship, and my real romance is
yet to come."

     Detectives today were known to be quietly seeking a young New York
broker, whose identity is being kept secret, to question him in an effort to
bring to light more facts about the murder.  This young man is said to have
been prominent in movie society.  He is described as a friend of a prominent
movie actress. ...Detectives gave no intimation of what light they believed
he might possibly shed on the mysterious slaying.

     The EXAMINER learned late tonight that a prominent rich young New
Yorker, formerly engaged to marry one of the most beautiful stars in the film
world, has mysteriously disappeared, and because this actress was a close
friend of William D. Taylor, the director murdered in his home last Wednesday
night, a nation-wide search has been instituted for the missing man. He is
reported to have checked out of his hotel last Wednesday afternoon and to
have departed from Los Angeles the following day, shortly after Taylor's body
was discovered.
     ...According to the authorities, this man was jealous of Taylor and
upbraided the actress for having anything to do with the director. He is said
to have employed one or more men to follow her, and on one occasion recently,
when she visited the Taylor bungalow, to have flown into a rage. This
occurred several hours after the visit, when his detectives reported the
matter to him. A stormy scene ensued and the actress is said to have broken
off her engagement on the spot. Efforts toward a reconciliation were made
later by the young man, but to no avail and he is said to have been brooding
and drinking heavily ever since.

     ...Detectives today are centering their investigation of the film
director's murder on information about a triangular love affair, in which the
slain man, a popular screen actress and a scion of a wealthy Eastern family
are said to have played the leading roles.
     ...The new love triangle theory projected itself strongly into the case
today when the police announced that they had learned a wealthy young New
Yorker, at one time reported engaged to marry a leading actress of the film
world, had mysteriously dropped from sight the day following the murder of
Taylor.
     Other investigators learned that the actress in question was a close
friend of the murdered man, and are proceeding on a theory that the former
fiance, discovering the close relationship existing between the screen star
and director, may have been driven to commit murder by his rage which
followed this revelation.
     ...Announcement was made that investigators have been detailed to trace
the movements of the young man, who checked out of one of the leading hotels
of the city the day after the murder and has not been seen by friends since.
     Police are acting on the report that the suspect fled to San Diego in
hopes of escaping across the border into Tiajuana.

                                                         LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
     Located by the EXAMINER late last night and questioned until midnight by
Deputy Sheriff Harvey Bell and George Pross, manager of the Burns Detective
Agency, the wealthy young New Yorker, who had been engaged to a motion
picture star frequently mentioned in connection with the William D. Taylor
murder mystery, gave an account of himself, which, in the opinion of the
officers, practically eliminates him from consideration.
     The examination of the young man occurred in a downtown hotel and was of
special interest because of his close attentions to two of the actresses most
conspicuous in the social life of Taylor.
     He was able, state the officers, to account for every hour of his time
on the night of the murder.  Interest had centered in this picturesque
character for several days, largely because he was known as the rejected
suitor of the star who, herself, was said to be infatuated with Taylor.
     Police and sheriff's officers were instructed to find this man, who had
checked out from the fashionable hotel where he was a guest on Wednesday
afternoon and, apparently, had disappeared.
     Information coming to THE EXAMINER late yesterday afternoon enabled one
of its representatives to locate him.  He was found in his room at a downtown
hotel and his interrogation followed.
     His elimination is regarded by the police as one of the most important
contributions to the case in that it removes a possibility which had engaged
the efforts of several officers, and thus narrows the field in which
investigation must be prosecuted.

   (from Minter's official statement to W.A. Doran, made on February 7, 1922)

engaged, and that was a freak of despondency."

     The angle eliminated today was the theory that the New York broker who
came here, ostensibly to marry Miss Mary Miles Minter, might have slain the
director out of jealousy.  It was well known that Taylor idolized the girl.
It was learned today, however, that the young man did not flee the city the
day after the murder from any apprehension.  The management of the hotel at
which he was guest, had requested him to leave.  The broker brought a film
actor and two extra girls into his room.
     It is declared that the quartet was noisy and that people in nearby
rooms summoned the hotel detective.  The latter declares there was much drink
in the place.  He says further that when he asked the women to leave the men
assaulted him.

     One of the theories related to a wealthy young man who had been in love
with her [Minter], was known to be extremely jealous and of highly emotional
character.
     Until today it had been supposed that this young man had been eliminated
from the case having, as it appeared, furnished a complete alibi.
     But a checking up on persons to whom this man referred for his alibi
brought forth the startling revelation that they had not been with him the
night of the murder, as he had claimed.
   It will now be necessary for this person to supply other evidence of his
movements on the night of February 1 or his arrest as a suspect undoubtedly
will follow.

     Here is the theory of the Taylor murder mystery that is coming to be
accepted by criminal investigators from Sheriff Traeger's office, a theory
not without certain substantiation that the investigators have quietly been
gathering the last forty-eight hours.
     ...She [Minter] flouted one who had formerly been the most favored of
her suitors, treated him with open contempt.  She snapped her fingers at him
in disdain, and, when she did, there grew in his heart a hate for Taylor as
unreasoning as the star's affection.
     He went to Taylor's home on the night of Feb. 1, according to the
theory, first to suggest, then to threaten and demand that Taylor break with
the girl--his girl.  ...Hate broke the leash and the despised and rejected
suitor turned loose the weapon he had brought to use only as a last resort.
He fired.

     A young New Yorker, whose father is a wealthy manufacturer, has been
brought under suspicion because of his devotion to the same pretty actress.
He has been hanging around Hollywood, and reports, now believed to have had
their inception in his own love-sick brain, that he was engaged to the
actress, have been circulated.  He was questioned early in the police
investigation and gave what appeared to be a satisfactory story of his
whereabouts.  Persons whose names he brought into the statement of his
movements on the night in question have contradicted him, according to the
investigators, and this has brought him under the shadow again.

     Arthur James, motion picture writer and an authority on the cinema, made
a spirited defense of Mary Miles Minter last night.  He has known the Los
Angeles star and her family since Mary's babyhood.
     He told this story of her recent reported betrothal to a young broker
here:
     "The poor youngster is so pursued by admirers that she sometimes is
compelled to say yes when they propose to her, in the hope of getting rid of
them.  Now this latest affair:
     "The young chap bothered her to marry him until one day she said she
would--in Los Angeles on New Year's Day.  It was a jest.
    "Well, on New Year's day the young man appeared in Los Angeles and
telephoned Mary to remind her that it was her wedding day.  She was at a
family dinner.
     "She exclaimed that she had forgotten all about the wedding and that she
would have to beg off.  No doubt she likes the young fellow, but I don't
believe she ever took the affair seriously."

     In our opinion the love letter, so-called, written by Mary Miles Minter
to Taylor, the film director, who was murdered, means nothing at all of
importance. Being personally acquainted with Mary and her family, we are
familiar with the little film star's nature and we are sure she might write
just such a letter to any man friend who had been her benefactor and admirer.
She would mean nothing by it other than an expression of such love as a happy-
go-lucky girl might have for her father or an uncle. Everybody calls Mary
"Dear," and every good friend of hers, male or female, kisses her when they
meet. In the theatrical and film world a kiss isn't a very serious affair.
Mary has always been a carefree innocent girl, closely chaperoned by her
mother, a very estimable Southern lady. We saw Mary in New York last June,
just before she sailed for Europe, and in front of fifty people at a dinner
at the Hotel Biltmore she kissed us. We mention this so that, after we are
shot, it won't be used to besmirch the reputation of Mary Miles Minter, who
is today just as sweet and innocent as she was when she appeared as the
barefoot kiddie in "The Littlest Rebel" eight years ago.

     The dumb darling of the photo drama who indicated her adoration of the
wonderman director by painting a picture of life with him in the hills, he
fetching the water and doing the cooking (she can only make tea) while she
divided her time between dusting and cuddling in his arms in some soft,
flimsy stuff, offers the most tangible clue in the connection with the taking
off of William Desmond Taylor.
     What was there to live for, with an eternity in the kitchen confronting
the cultured man?

     Mabel Normand's "Blessed Baby" letters to the now defunct William Taylor
were found in an old boot in the Taylor residence. And it was because of such
letters as Mabel and Mary Miles Minter wrote him that Taylor put his foot in
it.

     Most of the folly and most of the ecstasy of the world has been written
into love letters. Down Los Angeles way the sudden taking off of a motion
picture director has revealed in superlative quantity the common impulse that
exists to let the emotions expand under the witching stimulus of a flowing
pen. One love letter is very like another; in this one thing the world
changeth never. It has all been said. Dido might have held the pen of Mabel
Normand in the hour she suspected Aeneas had his mind set on his famous
getaway; Cleopatra might have written like the Minter girl when Antony's eye
seemed to be roving a trifle free. Nothing original is to be found in love-
letters, probably because there is nothing original in love. This is not
astonishing. The thing that bemuses understanding is that in this day of
highly-developed inventive genius no substitute has been adopted for the
paper-and-pen love letter. What is disappearing ink for if not kindly to
erase the follies of yesterday under the blushing second though of today?
     Should it not be a Medean law that all love letters are returnable to
the sender by registered return mail, special delivery? Apparently the itch
to write may not be appeased and the letters must be written; but must we and
our children and generations yet unborn forever read and re-read the eternal
secret of what one person thinks of another in that "first fine careless
rapture," or otherwise, which is found in the love letter?

              Written Words, Like Bullets, Can Never Be Recalled
     "Do right and fear no man,
     Don't write, and fear no woman."
     How many tragedies would be averted if these two simple lines were
followed.
     And now the latest one is filling the pages of the press, in which a
murder was committed, and in which love letters play a highly prominent part.
     Doubtless Mabel Normand is at present wishing she had never written
those letters to William D. Taylor, because of the great trouble they have
already caused her in this complex situation.
     People do not realize how silly they can be until they read over the
love letters that they wrote long after the love is gone.
     And when they appear in cold type, in the headlines of a newspaper, they
look foolish indeed. Only a person who has been the writer can understand the
feeling of seeing his lovelorn missives, written at midnight, just after
seeing him or her, finally brought out in the broad daylight where everybody
can see them.
     Young people should be very careful to whom they write love letters.
Better say it with words and save the pricks, that come from a pen-point.
     As to the case mentioned, I cannot help wishing that Mr. Taylor had
either burned Miss Normand's letters or returned them to her. Had he followed
the wisdom of the great poet of his country, he would not have failed to do
this. For Kipling has wisely put this way as the only way for a gentleman to
follow:
     "If She have written a letter, delay not an instant, but burn it."

     Much of the most sensational matter has been, with more or less wisdom,
suppressed or diluted, and much can never be printed in any family newspaper.
One of the stars whose name has been brought into the case with regularity--
not Miss Normand--went so far as to threaten one of the newspapers with a
libel suit but changed her mind when informed that a photographic copy of the
letter that had been partly published, [3] was kept and would be exhibited in
court should suit be brought. There will be no suit.

     A whole lot depends on location. For instance X in algebra is said to

     Have you heard about how all the girls in Hollywood are rushing madly to
get their letters back from their sweethearts old and new? Why, sweethearts
away back as far as the third before the last are being begged for their
letters!
     Just perfectly nice girls are as anxious as can be. Because, as one of
them said to me--she's engaged to a film star--no matter how innocuous your
letters may be, if you're in love with a man you're just bound to write mushy
stuff that would look awfully silly in print. Who can tell when something
might happen to him, and they might be using that goo stuff as evidence!

     Certain tender missives found in the rooms of a man who was murdered in
California are causing no end of trouble for the ladies who wrote them. Even
though they may be nothing more than innocent expressions of pure affection,
the authors doubtless are agonizing over the possibility that they may be
read by a laughing public.
     It makes little difference that about 98 per cent of the adult readers
have written love notes themselves. There is a curious quirk in the average
mind that always regards a love letter--another's love letter, of course--as
funny. Yet boys and girls go on writing them, and so do men and women, and
every once in a while they keep turning up at awkward moments to plague the
writers beyond measure.
     What, then! Shall people stop writing them? Heaven forbid! When love
itself goes out of fashion, when moonlight and starshine cease to play pranks
with the emotions, when a scented envelope loses its charm, when men are too
cold to thrill and women too indifferent to please, when sense has outlawed
sensibility, when all the Omars shall cling only to barren reason--then and
not until then shall the love note be outlawed, without benefit of clergy.
     Discretion, to be sure, would prevent the sending of many a dainty
confection of words, but who is Discretion that he should pretend to be a
lover? It was of Discretion that Hafiz was thinking when, as Kipling
translates him, he advises that a letter from "Her" should be burned, adding:
"Tear it to pieces, O Fool, and the wind to her mate will return it." But
just now the question is not of letters to any "Her" who has an obstreperous
mate in the background.
     It was Emerson--or was it?--who advised one to walk ten miles before
writing one letter. But that is nonsense. There is a better and safer way
than that, if one must court safety. And that is to write the letter, to put
one's soul into its composition, to write singing words fit for Philomel's
melody--and then to tear it up without sending it.
 
 
                                 Frozen Horror
 
                                                             February 8, 1922
                                                   LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL
                              Moviedom's New Art
     Taylor, the Hollywood movie director, will not have died in vain if his
death shall have taught some of the screen "stars" to act.
     Mary Miles Minter, who admits she wrote to Taylor scented notes laden
with X's and "I love you--I love you--I love you," discovered, by looking
into a mirror, that she could act when she heard of Taylor's murder. "It was
terrible," says Mary. "I rushed at once to my mirror and looked at my face. I
was appalled. I kept the expression and hurried to mama.
     " 'Mama,' I cried, 'did you ever see this expression on my face before?'
     " 'No,' she said. 'It is perfect frozen horror. You've never done it
before.' " [4]
     Now if Mary can only keep that frozen horror in cold storage until she
can get it on the screen in her next picture, movie fans may yet see on
Mary's face something which, like Mary's mother, they never saw there before.
     And if Mary has been stirred to deep facial emotion by Taylor's taking
off, is it not likely that many, many other screen stars were similarly
stirred? Mary was only one of those stars whose orbits encircled Taylor. It
may be that these others lacked Mary's thought to rush to mirrors and inspect
their faces when they heard of Taylor's assassination: that they failed to
grip the frozen horrors thus revealed and before they melted hurry away to
mammas or other witnesses just as good. But no doubt they have learned a
lesson from Mary and will be better prepared to improve their opportunity the
next time one of their dear ones is snuffed out. Probably they could cut out
the rush to mirrors, for do they not carry mirrors around with their powder
rags, anyway; while as for mamma, to make sure of having her within reaching
distance before the thaw, couldn't they declare a Pekingeses holiday and
attach the leash to mamma?
     There would seem to be great possibilities of Mary's discovery how to
acquire new facial expressions. In a free and easy colony like Hollywood it
ought not be difficult to provide for the slaughter of some loved one
whenever a star feels the need of a shock that will be good for a frozen
horror or other similar tragic refrigeration.
     Moreover, this field for the renaissance, or origination, of the art of
acting in moviedom which Miss Minter has opened up is by no means limited to
the production of emotions of horror and grief. It should be even more
fertile in products of joy, exultation and ecstasy. If a star could fill an
icehouse with frozen horror for use in the films by having one of her lovers
snickersneed, [5] she could lay in a yet more plentiful stock of joy by
having one of her enemies kiboshed. And with its rivalries and jealousies,
moviedom abounds even more in enemies than in lovers. None of its stars would
ever be at a loss to pick out an enemy for the butcher whenever she felt the
need of a boost of her joy emotions. The supply of enemies would last as long
as moviedom lasted.
     There would be the rub. With such a system of stimulating acting in
practice, how long would moviedom--Hollywood, at least--last? Might not
Hollywood, by the incessant slaughter of lovers and enemies, ultimately be
exterminated?
     Even so, there seem to be some people who would not be inconsolable for
that. For instance, there is that Eastern moving picture magnate, Herbert
Brenon, who thinks "it would be a jolly good thing if Hollywood were
abolished" at once. [6]

     For the broadening of Mary Miles Minter's newly discovered art it is a
pity that this twinkling screen star was not in rushing distance of a mirror
so that she could have discovered what was the frozen expression on her face
when she saw that Mabel Normand beat her to it and fainted dead away right
there in front of the whole show at the Taylor funeral.

                                 Mary's Horror
     For an original way of displaying deep emotion at the death of a friend,
Mary Miles Minter wins the lace soup ladle.
     Poor Miss Minter could not tell how she felt until she saw her face.
Even then she needed mama to tell her it was an emotion she had never
"registered" before. It's fortunate the news didn't come while Mary Miles
Minter was in the dark, for then she never would have known just how she did
take it.
     The death of loved human beings has been a most fertile source of
artistic expression. The poetry, prose, music and drama of the world would
suffer irreparably if they were deprived of their eulogistic pieces.
     It remained for Miss Minter, however, to invent a new form of artistic
eulogy--the frozen-horror movie face.

                               Bon Voyage, Mary!
     Dear Mary Miles Minter, who made famous the frozen-horror face, has
sailed for Honolulu, Hong Kong and other points east.
     So far as can be learned, she has packed her emotions in her suitcase,
fearing to leave them behind on her bureau. It's never safe to be separated
long from one's emotions. While some of them are preserved by freezing,
others are known to melt, disintegrate and decay.
     With her emotions, Mary Miles has placed her mirror. There they are side
by side, so that when Mary tries on an emotion, she can see its effect
immediately and thus find out just how she is feeling.
     For example, if she nestles in a quiet corner of the hurricane deck and
is subjected to the blandishments of the flirts that haunt the seven seas,
she should have her emotional kit by the side of her steamer chair.
     Otherwise, she'd be at a dead loss to react in the proper manner, being
wholly ignorant of her feelings until she looks in the mirror.
     In this connection, a theory regarding this charming damsel has been
conceived. It will be remembered that when the news of the death of her
friend, William Desmond Taylor, was brought to her, she not only registered
perfect frozen horror, but was able to carry the expression to her mamma and
have it interpreted.
     It is said by close analysis of Mary Miles' makeup that the term
"frozen" is not strictly accurate, but is merely used as a metaphor. It is
said, further, in explanation of this gift of preserving an expression, that
Mary Miles has no trouble at all in exercising it. Mary Miles, they say, is
concrete from the neck upward and impressions upon such a skull last
extraordinarily well.
     A pleasant voyage to Mary Miles!

                     The American Occupation of Movieland
     Movieland, Southern California.--The marines have landed and have the
situation well in hand. The devil dogs constitute the Army of Occupation of
Movieland and will remain here until peace has been established and Movieland
formally annexed to the United States. All bars have been closed and the
marines are now raiding the peanut stands. No unpleasant incident occurred
during the occupation except the burning of the beautiful library belonging
to one of the native queens, consisting of two books, one by Nietzsche, the
other by Freud, a telephone directory, and a copy of the Police Gazette.
     A large number of the chiefs and natives assembled this afternoon, and I
read to them the provisions of the Volstead act, which they had never heard
of before. They cheered vociferously until they discovered that it also
applied to cocktails. I also read them the constitution of the United States,
and they thought it was very pretty. They seem to be a good natured people,
willing to obey our laws as soon as they find out what they are. A large
number of the inhabitants have expressed the wish to go to America, and have
offered to take the oath of allegiance, but as most of them are being held as
witnesses to something or other, their requests could not be complied with.
Some of the inhabitants are demanding a plebiscite, but I do not think that
the claims of America to sovereignty on the ground that the country formerly
belonged to the United States will be forcibly disputed.

     The American marines, who are now in complete possession of Movieland,
report no further casualties. A drastic curfew law has been put in force and
all the inhabitants of Movieland are required to be in their houses by 7
o'clock in the evening. This drastic rule caused much excitement, as most of
the residents of this strange country were not in the habit of getting up
until that hour unless they were posing in a picture. The provost marshal
issued an announcement today that caused much comment. "The night," said the
provost marshal, "is the time for sleeping." The natives of Movieland said
they never heard of such an outlandish thing. The provost marshal also
declared that February, March and April must be regarded as closed months for
grouse, quail, directors, scenario writers, black bear, tourists and game of
all kind. Whether or not these will be permitted to be shot in the future
rests on Will Hays, the new governor-general of Movieland, who has not yet
arrived. Movieland is fast becoming Americanized, and its annexation can be
looked for in the near future.

                                Shooting Stars
     State of California is going bankrupt trying our moving picture actors
for murder.
     They have started in to improve movies by shooting all movie actors.
     If your wife gets celluloid bug and wants to go to California for film
career, don't waste money on railroad ticket. Keep her at home and shoot her
yourself.
     Day in Hollywood opens up with close-up of jailhouse, cut-back to scene
of crime and fade out of coroner's chariot.
     Latest artillery practice in Los Angeles is great break for one star now
in Mr. Jail's house. California has had so many cannon parties that State has
run out of witnesses. Therefore, they've got to let him off so he can serve
as foreman of jury in this latest and more modern assassination.
     Old-time actors used to get flowers over footlights.
     Enthusiasts used to follow Booth, Bernhardt, Maude Adams with handful of
flowers.
     Nowadays, friends of movie actors follow them with whole carriage full
of blossoms.
     They may get plenty of blooms, buds and bouquets, but they never smell
'em.
     Hollywood doesn't take disarmament conference seriously.
     Let's go back to pie throwing stage again. If we have choice of
embalmer's or baker's wagon, we'll take pastry limousine.
     Movie actors once roamed plains in countless numbers. But ruthless
extermination will soon make 'em scarcer than moths on iceberg.
     Good actors are getting scarce. If Hollywood stars must have their
matinee scenarios written by Krupp's, why don't they shoot their
understudies?

                       Hollywood's Wilds to be Explored
     A voyage more hazardous, it is said, than the Traprock expedition to the
South Seas will be started on Saturday, when the Sherwood-Connelly-Barton-
Howard mission to the wilds of Hollywood sets sail from these shores on the
steamship Ruth Alexander of the Admiral Line. The make-up of the expedition,
it was announced today, would be Robert E. Sherwood, motion picture critic of
Life, Marc Connelly, one of the two principal authors of "Dulcy"; Ralph
Barton, the art-artist; and Sidney Howard the play-playwright.
     Going to Havana and then through the Panama Canal, the party will cruise
up the coast of California to a point due west of the Los Angeles movie
colony, where they will disembark and, with the aid of native guides, proceed
inland.
     "We are fully aware of the risks we are taking," declared Chief Bob
Sherwood of the expeditionary force today. "However, our minds are made up.
We shall not return until we have found the answer to the much mooted
question, 'What's all the shootin' for?' "
     According to one report, bullet-proof suits will be distributed as the
explorers near their destination.
     "Among other things," added Chief Explorer Sherwood, "we are hopeful
that our visit will be productive of a number of reforms. This is not merely
the beginning of the See Hollywood First movement. If Hollywood is to be made
safe for democracy it must get over its absurd idea of modesty, its chronic
distaste of publicity. The inhabitants must come out in the open, give their
names to the papers and not shrink like wild violet from the white light of
the public gaze. We hope by our example to cure them. I trust I make myself
clear."
     The expedition will return to civilization in about six weeks.

     (New York)--"Burn it up! The Hollywood film colony is a pernicious
influence. Scatter it, abolish it--something ought to be done. Burn it up--I
say."
     Frank Mayo, screen and stage star and a resident of Hollywood as a
member of the Universal Company, made this statement here today.
     "If I express myself bitterly, I am expressing what every self-
respecting actor in Hollywood feels," he said.
     "The best thing that could happen to moving pictures would be to abolish
the Hollywood colony.
     "Why don't we actors who have respect for our art and ourselves get
together and demand a 'clean up' of the undesirables? What good would that
do? You forget that some of the biggest stars in the business are among the
undesirables. They have been raised to positions for which they are not
fitted. They receive enormous salaries. They haven't the brains or desire to
improve themselves and they spend their money like drunken sailors. They make
us all suffer. It isn't fair, and I, for one, resent it."

                      Hollywood Up In Arms At Frank Mayo
     An avalanche of indignation followed today in the wake of the statement
credited to Frank Mayo, film actor, in a New York dispatch yesterday, in
which the Hollywood motion picture colony was severely criticized.
     Publication of Mayo's interview brought instant protest. The actor's
ears must have "burned" continually since yesterday if the superstition holds
good, for all Hollywood "panned" him unmercifully. For the moment he was as
big a subject for conversation as was the Taylor murder.
     Mayo's unexpected attack on the Hollywood motion picture colony was
described as "ravings" and "an example of the lengths to which some notoriety-
seeking individuals will go to get their name in the paper."
     Scores of picture celebrities and studio executives strongly condemn
Mayo's act. At every studio protests were heard.
     Mayo recently figured in a sensational divorce suit.
     As one prominent star put it, "Persons who live in glass houses should
not throw stones."

     While reading a copy of your edition of February 7 we Gobs happened to
notice the story of Mr. Frank Mayo, entitled "Burning--Hollywood--Scatter
It." He used the expression his class spent their money "like a drunken
sailor." We believe this to be a very poor way of comparison. Seems to be
some mistake, or brainless judgment on his part. When, where did he get the
phrase? We do not know his position during the war, but only as a movie man.
But I take it that he was in no service, or he would give his title a second
thought. I would suggest that Mr. Mayo and all other actors live on navy pay
awhile and see how drunk they could get.

     A sweeping denial of an interview credited to him and in which he was
quoted in dispatches from New York as scathingly scoring the Hollywood film
colony recommending that it be "wiped out" is contained in a telegram
received today from Frank Mayo, motion picture star.
     A storm of criticism followed in the wake of the reputed interview with
Mayo. From various sources in Hollywood he was classed as "an actor seeking
cheap notoriety." Several organizations, including well known film stars,
were said to be contemplating action against him. Among these organizations
are the Motion Picture Directors' Association, the American Society of
Cinematographers, the Assistant Directors' Association and the Writers'
Guild.
     Mayo, charging that he was misquoted in New York, wired today as
follows:
     "Have just seen what was sent to California papers purporting to come
from me. I never saw such a distorted story in my life. It is true I talked
to a reporter about my personal appearances in New York, said I did not live
in Hollywood, but I thought it needed more amusements. Absolutely nothing
more. Was thunderstruck and heart broken at way personal talk was used. I
have never made any statement against anybody or any place in my life. Please
make this denial as strong as possible. Hollywood suits me and I am coming
back to California and my friends in the profession with the same feeling I
always entertained."

     Frank Mayo spent several hours in town last week on his way from coast
to coast. He wasn't a bit happy. He says he was misquoted in a certain
newspaper, and as a result the world's down on him.
     He was quoted as saying that Hollywood should be cleaned up--or burned
up--or something, WHICH, he says, he never asserted. There may have been wild
parties, he admits, but he never was in any of 'em and never saw anything of
the kind. But the picture people think he's done 'em dirt, and they haven't
hesitated to let him know it.
     Moreover, deplored poor Mr. Mayo, he got in bad with the navy, they
having read that he had said the Hollywood folk spent their money "like
drunken sailors."
     "I've been writing lots of letters," Mr. Mayo said mournfully, "and I'm
beginning to get myself squared."
     This husky star has been in New York. Circumstances sound like maybe a
little birdie told him he'd better hie him to the woods and keep real still
for a long, long time!
 
 
                        Tall Tales #1: Walter Underwood
 
                                                            February 10, 1922

     A man believed to be an important witness, if not an actual conspirator
in the murder of William Desmond Taylor, is in secret custody of the police
at Topeka, Kansas.
     He admits that he was an intimate acquaintance of Edward F. Sands,
fugitive valet-secretary to the slain motion picture director, and attended
many orgies of women, liquor and "dope" in the Taylor bungalow.
     Further admissions indicate that he was with Sands the night of the
mysterious murder and that two days after it he embezzled more than $1000
from the Pacific Electric Railroad in Los Angeles to effect the escape of the
pair.
     The suspect was taken off a Santa Fe train at Topeka, which left Los
Angeles Monday evening.
     He took his arrest calmly.
     "Well, you've got me," he remarked to Sheriff Robert Miler, who boarded
the train and grabbed him, "and you've got a big one."
     Then he admitted his name was Walter Underwood and that he was employed
by the Los Angeles interurban line until his departure.
     "What made you depart?" he was asked.
     "Well, I embezzled more than $1000 and had to go," he said.
     "But my father is worth $300,000 and he will get me out of this scrape."
     "What do you know about the Taylor murder?" asked Sheriff Miler.
     "I knew Sands and Taylor well," he said. "I have been on many parties at
the Taylor bungalow, where Mabel Normand and other actresses were present.
     (Miss Normand, seen at her home here last night, denied ever knowing
Underwood or ever having heard his name.)
     "In fact, I was on a wild party with Sands a night or two--well, it was
so wild and long drawn out I don't recall exactly when it ended."
     "Would the party have been in progress the night of the murder?"
     "Well--say, are you trying to hook me for that murder?" he suddenly
exclaimed, and refused to talk any more.
     The man admitted that he was acquainted with both William Desmond Taylor
and Sands, and saw Taylor a week before his death.

murder. "I know nothing about it, but it was jealousy that caused it."

     That the celebrated movie actresses whom he declares took part in the
wild parties at the home of the murdered director never used their real
names, but were known by nicknames, such as May, Kitty, Babe, or some other
similar pet name, was the declaration of Underwood.
     "The women I met at Taylor's house were never formally introduced to me
as Miss Normand, or Miss Minter," Underwood declared.
     "Then how did you meet them?" he was asked. "Didn't some one, a mutual
acquaintance, introduce you?"
     "No, we just went in, and the rest of the party were there, and during
the evening I would hear someone call one of the actresses Kitty, or
something like that. If I had occasion to talk to one I would apply my own
pet name to her."
     "Then how did you know that some girl whom you met at this fellow
Taylor's house was really Miss Mabel Normand or Miss Mary Miles Minter?"
     "Oh, I guess I know them when I see them," he replied. "I don't need to
be told who anyone is around there."
     "Aren't you just trying to kid the public and get a lot of fun out of
this Taylor and Sands story?"
     "No kidding, I really knew them. Both of them."

     (Topeka)--Undersheriff Carlson said, "Underwood knew both Sands and
Taylor and he told me that, from what he knew of the latter, he suspects a
woman committed the murder.
     "Underwood said he belonged to one of the so-called 'Oriental' clubs of
which Taylor was also a member. My prisoner informs me that he has attended
parties at the club, and that he several times attended them with Taylor and
others from the moving picture colony at Hollywood.
     "Did he tell you anything of what went on at those parties?" the
undersheriff was asked. "Is the man a drug addict?"
     "No," the undersheriff replied, "Underwood is not a 'dope.' He told me
he was present only at 'open house' parties of the club, and that the worst
excesses he ever witnessed were those committed by men and women who became
intoxicated, or who stupefied themselves with drugs, which, he said, they
took without embarrassment in the presence of other guests.
     "It is a question how much the man really knows. From his conversation
he either knows something, or he is just seeking publicity."

     The theory that Walter Underwood knew Edward F. Sands or had any
knowledge of the crime was flouted by W. T. Maddex, Underwood's step-father.
     "The boy was a lover of notoriety," he said.
     "I am certain that he never knew Sands or Taylor either. He would
sometimes tell his mother in an off-hand way that he had met some of her
friends or acquaintances on the street and it would later develop there was
no truth in his story."
     According to Maddex, Underwood was a lover of adventure.
     Maddex admitted that authorities had made the right arrest in connection
with the embezzlement charge.
     "We have both told Walter above all things else to be honest," Maddex
said seriously.
     "I have many times heard his mother tell him that."
     Maddex, although he has the utmost confidence and friendship of Pacific
Electric officials, by virtue of the fact that he was formerly manager of the
Redondo line, said he would make no move to soften his step-son's punishment.
     "I had concluded that since Walter is 31 years old he is old enough to
understand fully what he did. If he was let off this time, it might mean only

     Walter Underwood frequently had recourse to certain little "pills" to
quiet his shaking nerves while employed as an assistant cashier at the
Pacific Electric Railway ticket office.
     This was made known by friends and co-workers of Underwood yesterday.

     A continual examination of Underwood yesterday failed to throw any light
on the Taylor murder mystery. It is doubtful, Sheriff Miler said, if
Underwood really knew either Taylor or Sands, although he has insisted all
along that he did. When asked point blank yesterday if he would know Taylor
or Sands if they were in the room, Underwood just laughed and refused to
admit or deny anything.

                  Underwood Is a Fake, Local Officers Believe
     That Walter Scott Underwood is telling his story of acquaintances with
William Desmond Taylor and Edward F. Sands to win notoriety, is the belief of
Sheriff Miler and other officers.
     "I did not put any stock in his story after I caught him in a lie the
night I took him from the train," Miler said. "After he had told me he had
not been in his stepfather's home in the last three weeks, he told a story
about his being taken to his stepfather's home in Taylor's car less than two
weeks ago. When I called him on it, he told me I had listened too closely to
his story. He quit talking about Sands and Taylor then."
     Officers from Los Angeles probably will arrive today to take Underwood
back to California.

                                                      SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
     (Los Angeles)--Underwood said Taylor lived in constant terror,
apparently of unseen enemies who menaced him.
     According to Underwood, he met Sands at Seventh and Broadway on the day
following the death of Taylor.
     "Well, I'm heading south. I probably won't see you again," Underwood
says Sands told him.
     "Where are you going?" Underwood says he asked.
     "Probably Mexico--possibly South America," Sands replied, according to
Underwood.
     Underwood said:
     "Some weeks previous to the murder I was sitting alone in a downtown
cafe when Taylor and a party of friends entered and took the table next to
mine. He was in a jovial mood, and within the next thirty minutes, observing
that I was alone, invited me to join his group. I accepted.
     "In the party were a number of women I recognized as having seen on the
motion picture screen--women that were known the world over as actresses of
the first degree. I will not give their names, because I do not wish to
involve any of them in this unpleasant affair.
     "These same women, however, I saw on numerous occasions when I was a
guest at the Taylor bungalow on Alvarado. I have my own theory regarding the
slaying and the connection of these people with it, but as to this angle I
have nothing to say."

     (Los Angeles)--...Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz, informed of these
statements, interviewed Underwood in his cell in the city prison and
dismissed him from consideration.
     "He's having a lot of fun," Biscailuz said.

[1]Mabel Normand's letters (dubbed "Blessed Baby" letters because that was
allegedly Taylor's term of endearment for her) vanished from Taylor's home
until they were discovered in the toe of a boot.  They were never published.
Three of Mary Miles Minter's letters to Taylor were published, including the
famous "I love you" letter.
