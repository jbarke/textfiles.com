                             What is TAYLOROLOGY?
TAYLOROLOGY is a newsletter focusing on the life and death of William Desmond
Taylor, a top Paramount film director in early Hollywood who was shot to
death on February 1, 1922. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major
scandals.  This newsletter will deal with: (a) The facts of Taylor's life;
(b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor
murder on Hollywood and the nation; (d) Taylor's associates and the Hollywood
silent film industry in which Taylor worked. Primary emphasis will be given
toward reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it
for accuracy.

This is the 50th issue of TAYLOROLOGY.  Truthfully, we never thought we would
make it this far--here's to the next 50 issues!!  For this landmark issue we
are reprinting Ed King's classic article "I Know Who Killed Desmond Taylor."
The article was originally published in 1930 and was reprinted in WILLIAM
DESMOND TAYLOR: A DOSSIER (Scarecrow Press, 1991).  Since both those sources
are out of print, reprinting it again in TAYLOROLOGY will hopefully keep the
article available to the public for many years to come.

"I Know Who Killed Desmond Taylor," by Ed King, was the best recap of the
murder written within a decade of Taylor's death, and is the only substantial
magazine article on the case ever written by one of the detectives who was
actually involved in the investigation. (Detective King is also mentioned in
contemporary items reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 8, 14, 17 and 19.)  Some of the
information in the article had not been revealed  to the public prior to the
article's original publication in 1930.  The article does contain some errors
which are indicated in the notes--unfortunately King relied too much on his
memory and newspaper clippings, and spent too little time reviewing the
official file on the case prior to doing the article.

               Special Investigator, District Attorney's Office,

                         as told to Alberta Livingston

               Originally published in TRUE DETECTIVE MYSTERIES
                           October and November 1930

     The "bumping off" of a famous person like William Desmond Taylor is the
sort of oyster that any detective delights to open, so you can just bet the
family jewels that I was pretty much elated when my "Chief," the late Thomas
Lee Woolwine, District Attorney of Los Angeles County, called me into his
private office on the morning of February 3rd, 1922, and assigned me to
represent his office in the investigation of this greatest of all murder
mysteries.
     And, almost from the very first hour of my investigations, I have KNOWN
who committed this murder. Yet, at the present time, the evidence is so
limited that were the guilty person to come forward and confess the murder,
"he" would have to produce corroborative testimony before "his" confession
could be accepted. "He" would be compelled to substantiate "his" confession
by other credible testimony in order to prove "his" guilt and secure "his"
own conviction!
     And that includes even Edward F. Sands--the one person who practically
every investigator in Los Angeles believes was the slayer.
     With this knowledge locked in my heart for the past eight years, my
position has forced me to carry on a nation-wide investigation, reaching from
the Pacific to the Atlantic seaboard, from the race tracks of Agua Caliente,
to the frozen depths of the Alaskan goldfields, knowing full well that each
new clue would lead me just where I expected it to lead--nowhere.
     During these eight years the case has been revived for discussion more
times than I can remember. Always there has been a repetition of old
stories--a dressing up in new garb of the figures in this murder mystery.
     Many times the murderer of Taylor has been reported discovered. The
report has always created the greatest sensationalism. And, each time the
story has proved to be pure fiction. Each time the guilty person has been
some unnamed ghostly personage, designated by the press by blanks and
asterisks, or referred to only as "that film celebrity," or "this noted
actress."
     At the time William Desmond Taylor met his tragic death, he resided in
the exclusive Alvarado Court Apartments on South Alvarado Street, Los
Angeles.
     This court is composed of sixteen apartments, housed in eight two-story
white stucco buildings, overlooking beautiful Westlake Park.
     In 1922 the Westlake Park district was the favorite residential
neighborhood for motion picture people, who have since emigrated to the
Hollywood and Beverly Hills sections.
     In the apartment adjoining Taylor's on the west, in the same building,
lived Edna Purviance, leading lady for Charlie Chaplin. [1] Directly to the
east, the buildings separated by an eight-foot parkway, lived Mr. and Mrs.
Douglas MacLean. Mr. MacLean has long been considered one of the foremost
movie comedians.
     William Desmond Taylor was at once the favorite and the mystery of the
motion picture colony. A cultured, dignified gentleman with a charming
personality and considerable magnetism, the men with whom he worked were
devoted to him, and most of the women fell in love with him.
     He never blazoned his good deeds from the housetops, but "Bill" Taylor
and his charities were household words in the motion picture profession.
     On February 2nd, 1922, about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, Henry Peavey,
colored valet-servant, arrived at Taylor's home to prepare breakfast, as
usual. [2]
     He picked up the milk bottle which stood on the front doorstep, inserted
the key in the lock, pushed open the door, but did not enter. [3] Instead, he
uttered a piercing shriek that aroused all  the neighbors. Someone called the
police and Detective Lieutenant Tom Ziegler, from Central Detective Bureau,
was detailed to the scene.
     Lieutenant Ziegler found William Desmond Taylor lying stretched full
length on the living room floor, stone dead.
     He was fully clothed. His head was towards the east wall, feet near the
door, legs outstretched. An overturned chair lay nearby. [4]
     A large crowd of people were milling in and out of the apartment and
about the body, which Ziegler did not touch. He requested everyone to leave
the house.
     A doctor, whose name was never learned but who was in the crowd when
Lieutenant Ziegler arrived, made a preliminary examination of the body
without moving it from its original position. He gave as his opinion that
death was due to natural causes, possibly heart trouble.
     A few moments afterward, while Ziegler was awaiting the arrival of the
Coroner, Mr. Charles Eyton, prominent member of the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, husband of Kathlyn Williams, movie actress, and a close personal friend
of Mr. Taylor during his lifetime, arrived upon the scene.
     Mr. Eyton went directly to the upper floor, to the bedroom of Taylor,
where he collected many letters and personal belongings of Taylor, among
which may have been much documentary evidence in this murder mystery.
     Lieutenant Ziegler did not interfere with Mr. Eyton, knowing him
personally and also knowing him to have been a close friend of Mr. Taylor's.
Eyton carried this collection of letters and other evidence away with him,
and later destroyed them.
     When questioned regarding his motive, he stated that among Taylor's
possessions were many love letters from married women, and that he did it
merely to protect "Bill," as he called Taylor, from becoming involved in any
scandal and not with a desire to obstruct any investigation into the matter
of Mr. Taylor's death.
     Before Mr. Eyton left the apartment, he returned to the body, talking to
Lieutenant Ziegler, who repeated the opinion expressed by the unknown doctor.
Not satisfied that death was due to natural causes, Eyton turned the body
over. It was then discovered that the deceased was lying in a pool of blood.
The pool had not spread to such an extent that it was exposed to view as the
body lay upon the floor.
     Lieutenant Ziegler saw at once that it was a case for the Homicide
Squad, and telephoned headquarters. The Flying Squad, which at that time
consisted of H. H. Cline, Ray Cato, Wiley Murphy, "Billy" Cahill, and Jesse
A. Winn, responded.
     Investigation disclosed that Taylor had been shot in the back, the
bullet ranging from the right side of the spine rather low in the torso,
upward through the left breast, where the bullet had lodged in the muscles
near the left shoulder. [5]
     The bullet hole in the coat did not correspond exactly with the one in
the vest, which indicated that Taylor had been standing with his arms above
his head when shot.
     The first theory advanced was that Taylor was holding his arms above his
head in response to the command of the intruder to "stick 'em up!" A second
theory was to the effect that he was reaching for the chair which was found
overturned near the body.
     If reaching for the chair, it would seem that a controversy had taken
place and that, in all probability, Taylor knew his attacker. But, if holding
up his hands, he was more than likely taken by surprise.
     My theory was, and always has been, that when Taylor returned to his
apartment, after having escorted Miss Mabel Normand to her automobile, he
seated himself at his desk, and his assailant, hiding in the room, stepped
out and fired. Taylor died instantly, pitched forward, and in falling upset
the chair.
     Due to the prominence of the victim, the news of the murder was flashed
all over the city, extras appearing upon the city streets in an almost
unbelievably short space of time.
     Hollywood, ordinarily serene, playful and carefree, was no longer calm.
The atmosphere of make-believe that has always seemed to hover over that
portion of Los Angeles, where lived and worked so many of those whose careers
and fortunes were centered in the world of finer arts, was gone.
     One of its most dearly loved members had been brutally done to death--
not a man with a past--not one at whom a finger of even the remotest
suspicion had ever been cast. Rather, one who represented the very highest in
the manly types of manhood.
     The coroner arrived, the body was removed, and the detectives, hot after
a motive, began a thorough search of Taylor's living quarters.
     The apartment, which consisted of five rooms, was tastefully furnished.
A baby grand piano occupied one corner of the living room. [6] The small desk
stood directly in front of the door. There  were books in profusion, mostly
philosophical and sociological. Relics of war and much expensive bric-a-brac
occupied prominent places throughout the house. Around the wall of the living
room was a solid border of autographed and framed photographs.
     Among them was one of Mary Pickford, which bore the inscription, "To my
nice director, William Desmond Taylor, the most patient man I have ever known
--Mary Pickford."
     In a prominent place on the piano stood a picture of another Mary. On
this photograph was inscribed: "For William Desmond Taylor--artist and
gentleman. Mary Miles Minter." [7]
     On the desk in the living room lay an open check book, a pen nearby. In
the drawer of the desk was a half-completed income tax report.
     In Mr. Taylor's pockets was found $78.00 cash. A two-karat diamond ring
and a platinum watch were found on his person. The finding of the articles
eliminated the robbery motive almost immediately. [8]
     The check book and the half-completed income tax report were seized upon
as important clues. The bank book showed a balance of only $6,000.00. All
other assets that could be found amounted to only about $25,000.00.
     The income tax blank showed Taylor's income to have been in the
neighborhood of $40,000.00 per year.
     What had he done with all his money? He lived very simply, made no
important investments, yet he had drawn large checks of which there was no
record. Among the cancelled checks was found one for $2500.00 made out to
cash. This amount had been withdrawn the latter part of January. The pass
book showed this same amount deposited a few hours before his death. [9]
     To the minds of the detectives, this could have but one explanation--
blackmail.
     The money had been withdrawn to pay some person--a person who would not
accept a check. Taylor, deciding not to be the victim of this plot, returned
the money to the bank. The blackmailer called, was met with refusal and ended
the argument with a bullet.
     But who? And WHY?
     Soon after the news spread, friends came rushing to the apartment. From
all quarters they came. Mary Miles Minter rushed into the house in a tempest
of hysterics.
     Following closely came Mabel Normand [10]--beautiful, impulsive,
unfortunate Miss Normand, who succumbed Sunday, February 23rd, 1930, to
tuberculosis in the Pottenger Sanitarium, at Monrovia, California. And,
almost her last words were, "I hope before I die that they find the slayer of
William Desmond Taylor."
     Miss Minter, at the present time, is ill in a sanitarium near Santa
Barbara, California, being treated by Doctor Sansum, a leading dietician.
     Miss Minter told detectives that Miss Normand and Mr. Taylor were
engaged at the time of his death. [11]
     Miss Normand admitted that she had called on Mr. Taylor a few hours
before he was shot, but denied the engagement.
     "There was no affair of the heart between Taylor and myself," sobbed
Miss Normand. "His feeling for me was that of an older man for a girl who
admired him, and who was not afraid to show her admiration.
     "I was eager to glean a little knowledge from the vast storehouse which
he possessed. He was a man who knew everything. Besides having the education
and instinct of an artist, he was a deep student of science and of philosophy
as well."
     Future references to Miss Normand are made only that the reader may have
full details of the story. While she became the central figure in the
sensational investigations, I do not hesitate to say that all suspicion cast
upon her was unjust.
     Miss Minter said that she had not seen Mr. Taylor for some time, nor had
she been to his apartment recently.
     "He was one of my best friends," she cried. "His death is a great shock
to me. I cannot conceive of the character of a person who would voluntarily
wrong him or cause his death. There is no personal or financial sacrifice
that I would not make to bring the slayer to justice."
     Among Taylor's effects were found a woman's pink silk nightgown and a
lace handkerchief, both with the initials, "M. M. M." [12]
     In the toe of a riding boot in the closet were found many letters,
written in code, signed, "Mary." These letters were ardent love letters and
received a great deal of publicity, but knowing the author as I afterward
learned to know her, well, I wouldn't say they were so hot--just a young girl
unshamedly confessing her love for the man she loved. [13]
     "What shall I call, you wonderful man?" began one of these letters. "I
want to go away with you--up in the hills--anywhere--just so we can be alone.
     "Wouldn't it be glorious to sit in a big comfy couch by a cozy warm fire
with the wind whistling outside, trying to harmonize with the faint strains
of music coming from the Victrola?
     "I would sweep and dust (they make the sweetest dust caps, you know).
Oh, yes, and fix the table and help you wash the dishes, and then, in my
spare time, darn your socks.
     "I'd go to my room and put on something scant and flowing; then I would
lie on the couch and wait for you. I might fall asleep, for a fire makes me
drowsy. Then I would awake and find two strong arms around me and two dear
lips pressed to mine in a long, sweet kiss..."
     Another letter, written in the same code, simply said: "I love you--Oh,
I love you so. God, I love you so. I love you--I love you--I love you."
     These letters, along with the nightgown and handkerchief, were taken to
the police station and booked as evidence in the event the murderer should
ever be apprehended.
     Early in the morning, February 3rd, 1922, District Attorney Woolwine
called me into his office where he handed me a letter--an anonymous letter in
a woman's handwriting, evidently written by a lady of refinement.
     This letter said that if Mr. Woolwine would send a detective to Mabel
Normand's apartment, located at Seventh Street and Vermont Avenue, a careful
search of the basement would reveal a .38 caliber pearl-handled revolver.
This was the gun with which the murder had been committed.
     Mr. Taylor had been murdered with a .38 caliber revolver. The bullet
taken from the body indicated this very clearly.
     Mr. Woolwine explained to me that he wanted me to enter the
investigation alone, independent of all officers of the Police Department,
but this I found impossible. The officers from the Police Department had a
day's start on me. My investigations led directly into theirs, so Lieutenant
Jesse Winn and myself joined up as a team, and have continued so throughout
the entire period of the investigation. (Winn, like myself, after more than
twenty years' service on the Police Department, retired therefrom and
accepted a position as special investigator in the D.A.'s office.)
     I went to Miss Normand's apartment, accompanied by Lieutenants Winn,
Murphy and Cline, where we made a thorough search of the house, including the
basement. From cellar to attic we went, devoting a great length of time to
turning over everything where it would be possible to hide a gun. In a
dresser drawer in Miss Normand's bedroom we found two .25 caliber revolvers,
neither of which could have had any connection with the murder. No other gun
was found.
     Miss Normand had been the last person to see William Desmond Taylor
alive, with the exception, of course, of the murderer. She had been with Mr.
Taylor in his apartment up to a very few minutes of the time that he was
murdered.
     Her statement, substantiated by the statement of her chauffeur, William
Davis, was to the effect that she had spent the afternoon in the shopping
district of Los Angeles. Around 6:00 o'clock in the evening she went to the
Hellman Bank, at the corner of 6th and Main Streets, where she placed some
very valuable Christmas gifts in her safety deposit box.
     While in the bank she called up her home. In answer to her questions as
to whether or not anyone had called her, the maid replied: "Mr. Taylor has
been trying to get you all afternoon. He left word that he has a good book
for you; wants you to stop for it this evening."
     Miss Normand returned to her limousine, parked at the curb, and said,
"Well, William, we will stop by Mr. Taylor's on the way home."
     At Seventh and Broadway Miss Normand purchased some peanuts and a number
of magazines, including a Police Gazette. She munched peanuts and read this
Gazette on the way out, strewing the shells on the floor of the car.
     Some time between six and seven o'clock they reached the Alvarado Street
address.
     Miss Normand stepped from the machine. As she started toward the house,
Davis asked, "Shall I go get my dinner?" To this Miss Normand replied, "No--I
am tired and have an early call to the studio. I will be right out."
     When Miss Normand entered the apartment, Mr. Taylor was in a closet
telephoning to Antonio Moreno, a close personal friend of his, and a well
known movie actor. Henry Peavey, colored valet, was preparing the evening
meal. [14]
     Miss Normand, waiting for Mr. Taylor to finished his conversation with
Mr. Moreno, paced up and down the living room, and as Henry Peavey afterward
related to us, was continually eating peanuts and throwing the shells on the
floor, much to Peavey's disgust, as it was his job to keep the apartment
clean. [15]
     Her attention seemed focused upon two photographs on the piano--one of
Mary Miles Minter and one of herself.
     When Mr. Taylor had finished his conversation, he came out of the
alcove, greeted her cordially, and gave her the book he had mentioned. This
book proved to be a heavy tome on German philosophy. Taylor and Miss Normand
were among the very few in Hollywood who did any heavy reading.
     While these two sat on the davenport in the living room and discussed
this book, Davis, the chauffeur, swept the peanuts shells from the car, then
picked up the Police Gazette which Miss Normand had left lying on the seat.
     Henry Peavey came out on his way home, kidded Davis about the magazine
and the peanut shells, then went on down the street towards Sixth and
Alvarado.
     Miss Normand remained in the house about thirty-five minutes in all,
then came out, accompanied by Mr. Taylor. The chauffeur and the director
exchanged friendly greetings. A general conversation ensued, Taylor chiding
Miss Normand good-naturedly about the Police Gazette.
     It was quite dark. Miss Normand noticed a light burning in the apartment
of Edna Purviance, and knowing that Miss Purviance had been ill for several
days, suggested to Mr. Taylor that they go up and see her. Mr. Taylor
insisted that she go home, as she was extremely nervous, and they could call
upon Miss Purviance some other time. [16]
     Miss Normand stepped into her limousine, and as it rolled away from the
curb, she blew a kiss to Taylor. It was an eternal farewell. Mr. Taylor
entered the apartment through the door which he had left open. It is presumed
that he sat down at his desk to work--the murderer, hiding in the room,
stepped out and fired. Taylor died instantly, and in falling pitched forward,
overturning his chair. The murderer then hurried from the house and
disappeared through the alley. [17]
     Mrs. Douglas MacLean, in the adjoining apartment, heard the shot. The
MacLeans were at their evening meal. Mr. MacLean had just finished eating and
had gone upstairs for a cribbage board. Miss Jewett, servant girl, had been
serving dinner. At about the time Mr. MacLean reached the bedroom upstairs,
and while Mrs. MacLean was still seated at the table, the shot was fired.
     Mrs. MacLean spoke to Miss Jewett, asking if that noise had not sounded
like a shot nearby. She rose from the table and walked to her living room
door. The figure of what appeared to be a man had just emerged from
Mr. Taylor's door. The person was not hurrying out but was coming out
backwards. [18]
     The thought suggested itself to Mrs. MacLean that he was talking to Mr.
Taylor, who was possibly seated at his desk directly in front of the door.
The figure turned, closed the door, faced Mrs. MacLean as it came down the
steps, and made a turn eastward, then to the north, passing between the
Taylor Apartment and the garage, going towards Fourth Street, where it
disappeared in the dark. [19]
     This person did not hurry at any time, but walked very leisurely and
looked full at Mrs. MacLean standing in her doorway. Her suspicions were not
aroused, and she attributed the report she had heard to the backfire of a
passing automobile rather than a shot from a gun.
     Later, in describing this person in the office of Mr. Woolwine, she
stated that the figure had worn a heavy coat of the mackinaw type, a cap, and
a muffler about the neck.
     She further stated that this person appeared to be a man, but if it was
a man, it was a "funny looking" man. When pressed as to just what she meant
by "funny looking," she explained that she had been on the movie lot a great
many times with her husband during the filming of pictures and had seen many
actors and actresses in make-up and they were "funny looking." The person
emerging from Mr. Taylor's apartment had this same appearance.
     Arthur Hoyt, a motion picture actor, close personal friend of the
deceased director, was living at the time of Taylor's death, at the Los
Angeles Athletic Club, Seventh and Olive Streets. On account of his close
friendship with Mr. Taylor, Lieutenant Winn and myself felt that he
undoubtedly would be able to give us valuable information concerning the
habits and past life of the director.
     We visited Mr. Hoyt in his room on several occasions, and one night,
possibly a week and a half after the murder, Detectives Cato, Cahill, Winn
and myself, decided to question him more closely than we had on previous
occasions.
     After about two hours' grilling Hoyt broke down and wept. He told us
that it was not his desire to break confidence with his dead pal and friend,
but that he believed he would have to do so if it would help to unravel the
mystery surrounding the murder.
     He then told us that on the evening of the last day of January--the
evening before the murder--he had arrived at his apartment at the Athletic
Club, and had partaken of several drinks, after which he started out, as was
his custom, to visit his friend, William Desmond Taylor.
     When he arrived at Taylor's residence, somewhere in the neighborhood of
6:00 o'clock, he found Mr. Taylor seated at his desk, nervously running his
fingers through his hair, preoccupied and worried.
     Feeling in the mood for another drink, Hoyt went straight past Taylor,
and on into the closet where the telephone was located, and where he knew
Taylor kept his liquor supply. Hoyt took from the closet two bottles, one
containing whiskey and the other seltzer, and started mixing a couple of
cocktails.
     "Don't mix me any," said Taylor. "I do not care for it."
     Noting his depression. Hoyt went over to him and questioned him as to
why he was worried. Taylor swore Hoyt to secrecy, saying that if he would
promise not to breathe it to a living soul, he would tell him something that
was causing him a great deal of worry.
     Mr. Taylor then told Mr. Hoyt that the dearest, sweetest little girl in
the world was in love with him, and that he was old enough to be her father.
This little girl was madly in love with him--had been to his apartment the
night before, coming at nearly 3:00 o'clock in the morning. She had insisted
on remaining. He had insisted on her going home, whereupon this little girl
had cried and threatened that if he tried to put her out, she would scream
and cause a scene.
     This, of course, Mr. Taylor wanted to avoid, as he had many friends in
the neighborhood. He finally persuaded her to leave, driving her to her home.
     Mr. Taylor stated to his friend Hoyt that this little girl had become so
infatuated with him that it was really becoming serious. He was worried--
didn't know what to do about it.
     Mr. Hoyt then said, "Bill, I know who you mean. It is ---"
     And Taylor admitted that it was. [20]
     The beautiful young girl named by Hoyt was interviewed by Winn and
myself at her home. She stated that she had not seen Mr. Taylor for a long
time, the last time being on the streets of Los Angeles. Mr. Taylor was in
his own car and she in hers. They merely waved to each other.
     This statement was not true. We were able to prove that she had been in
his apartment many times, and had actually been there the night of the
murder.
     We had never been satisfied that the person seen by Mrs. MacLean,
emerging from the Taylor residence, was not a woman in disguise as a man,
inasmuch as Mrs. MacLean had stated that it was a "funny looking" man.
     Winn and myself thought out a plan whereby we might learn something
definite regarding this matter.
     We went to the office of Nick Harris, private detective, and explained
to him what we had in mind, knowing that he carried a standing with the daily
press which would enable him to get almost any story run.
     We explained to Mr. Harris that we wanted him to call the editor of a
daily paper and tell him that a funny thing had just occurred; that Winn and
myself had just called at his office and that while we were seated there in
conversation with him, the telephone bell rang, and a woman was on the other
end of the wire, who stated she was a spiritualist.
     This woman stated that the night before she had had a vision in which
the murderer of William Desmond Taylor appeared; that the murderer was a
woman with a very beautiful daughter; that Taylor had been too familiar with
the daughter; that the mother in desperation had shot and killed Taylor, and
that, in her estimation, the mother was justified.
     The spiritualist continued that she thought it was the mother's duty to
come out and tell the truth--tell the authorities that she had committed the
murder and why she did it; that she was going to give the mother two weeks'
time in which to explain to the public that she was the murderer of Taylor,
and why she had committed the murder. That, at the end of that time, if the
mother hadn't come forward and told the truth, she, the spiritualist,
intended to make it public.
     He concocted this story merely for the purpose of seeing what the result
might be. The evening paper ate it up and ran almost a column story about it.
[21]
     The following morning an attorney visited the District Attorney's office
with the clipping from the newspaper. He wanted to know the name of the
spiritualist, where she was located, if she had mentioned in her conversation
the name of the woman with the beautiful daughter, and many similar
questions.
     I explained to him that all I knew about it was merely what had happened
while we were in Mr. Harris' office. This attorney returned on the second day
and made further inquiry. There was no one else who every made inquiry about
this news item.
     Secret investigation revealed this man to be the personal attorney for
the mother of the beautiful girl whom Taylor had told Mr. Hoyt was madly in
love with him.
     Lieutenant Winn and myself next went to the property room at police
headquarters and endeavored to secure the clothing worn by Mr. Taylor at the
time of his death. We found that this wearing apparel was still at the
undertakers. When we arrived at the Ivy Overholtzer mortuary, we were just in
time. They were about to burn the clothing, as it was covered with blood, and
they considered it of no value.
     Under the collar of the coat and extending possibly from one-half to one
inch, were three long, blond hairs. These were compared by an expert with
combings taken from the dressing room of Mary Miles Minter, and pronounced to
be the same. At this period women were wearing long hair, it being before the
days of the bob.
     These hairs were placed in an envelope and left with the property clerk
at Central Police Station for safe keeping.
     After finding these hairs, Miss Minter was called into the D.A.'s office
and requestioned. She could add nothing to her previous statements.
     After questioning Miss Minter, we went to the home of her mother, Mrs.
Charlotte Shelby, to question her regarding any knowledge she might have of
the mystery.
     Mrs. Shelby was preparing to leave for New York on the 6:00 o'clock
train. When I requested an interview, she came to the door, fastening her
dress. She informed me coldly that her attorneys, Mr. Mott and Mr. Cassill,
were in the house for the purpose of answering questions, and that she was in
too much of a hurry to reach New York to devote any time to an investigation
about which she knew nothing.
     We next questioned Mary [Julia] Miles, mother of Mrs. Shelby, and
grandmother of Mary Miles Minter. Mrs. Miles stated to us that Mrs. Shelby
was out on the evening of the murder until about 9:00 o'clock: that she had
been shopping during the day and visiting friends early in the evening.
     About this time District Attorney Woolwine ordered all the evidence in
the case transferred from the Police Station to his office, where it was
placed in a cabinet. All this evidence later disappeared, and in a
conversation with Robert Herron, of this office, I learned that he was
ordered by Woolwine to take the articles, except the coat and vest, to
Woolwine's home. Possibly the letters, the hairs, the handkerchief and the
nightgown were turned over to Miss Minter, Woolwine being a close personal
friend of both Miss Minter and her mother, Mrs. Shelby.
     While we had been working on the case from the love, revenge and
jealousy motive, other detectives, working on the blackmail theory, had dug
deep into Taylor's past life. [22]
     Born in 1877 [1872], in Ireland, Malloss [Carlow], County Cork, he was
the son of a British Colonel and an Irish gentlewoman. His upbringing was one
of every advantage, with special attention paid to his education along
military lines.
     His father desired him to follow in his footsteps in the British army,
and with this purpose in view of becoming an engineering in the King's army,
he studied in a number of European colleges and universities.
     Because of poor eyesight, however, he was a failure in the army, and at
the age of eighteen he made his first contact with the stage, becoming
secretary to the famous Charles Hawtrey Company.
     This was not satisfactory to his father, the stern British Colonel, who
objected to everything connected with the stage, so he purchased for his son
a ranch in Harper, Kansas.
     Taylor spent two years on this ranch, but the stage had gotten into his
blood. Fanny Davenport came along, invited him to play juvenile parts in her
company, and, armed with a three-year contract, Taylor left the ranch in
Kansas.
     On the stage he met with varying success. When the famous Klondike gold
strike occurred, the spirit of adventure in his Irish veins evidently, for
the moment, crushed out the stage from his desires, and he joined other
daring souls in Alaskan lore.
     The year 1914 found him in Hollywood. Like scores of his former friends,
actors and actresses, he left the stage for the silent drama--the footlights
for the Kleigs.
     After making several pictures for Vitagraph, Kay Bee, and other
companies, these pictures including "Captain Alvarez" and "The Iconoclast,"
he turned from his place in front of the camera to the more important one
behind, took up directing, and in 1922, he was looked upon as one of the
greatest directors who ever shouted, "Camera."
     At the outbreak of the World War Taylor enlisted as a private in the
Canadian Army. He was one of the first 100,000 to sail overseas from Quebec
[sic]. He soon rose from private to the rank of Captain, commanding a truck
train running from Dunkirk to the British front.
     This much of Taylor's life was known to his friends of the motion
picture world. Unfeigned astonishment was felt by all when we dug still
deeper and found that he had actually lived a dual existence.
     In 1901 he had married one Ethel May Harrison, a member of the original
Floradora Company. They had one child, Ethel Daisy, who was found in an
exclusive girls' school at Mamoroneck, Long Island.
     Prior to 1908 he was known in New York as William Cunningham Deane-
Tanner, a cultured art connoisseur. He had one brother, Denis Gage Deane-
Tanner. One day in 1908 friends and business associates were startled by his
sudden and mysterious disappearance. His wife could give no clue to his
whereabouts and could ascribe no reason for his action.
     An examination of his books showed everything in perfect shape. After an
extensive search, the family and friends set it down as an unsolved mystery.
His wife divorced him and later remarried.
     Further investigation disclosed that four years after Taylor disappeared
from his home in New York, his brother, Denis Gage Deane-Tanner, disappeared
from his home in New York under similar circumstances. He, too, had married
and was head of a family. That any domestic difficulties were responsible for
his disappearance was denied by his wife.
     Mrs. Ada Deane-Tanner had suffered a nervous breakdown and went into the
Adirondacks to recuperate. When she returned with her two small daughters,
her husband was missing.
     The books of the firm by whom he had been employed disclosed the fact
that he was in no way involved in financial difficulties. Detectives scoured
the world for a trace of this missing brother, but from the day he
disappeared no trace of him was ever found.
     Six years before the death of William Desmond Taylor, Mrs. Ada Deane-
Tanner had recognized a picture of him, and appealed to him for aid. He, at
first, denied his identity, but later sent her an allowance of $50.00 per
month, which had continued during the entire six years. Mrs. Tanner could
give us little information regarding Taylor, as she had seen him but
once. [23]
     Inquiry in New York showed that Taylor's wife had learned his identity
when she and her daughter, Ethel Daisy Tanner, attended a picture show.
Taylor's image was flashed upon the screen.
     "That's your father!" exclaimed the mother.
     The daughter sought his address and wrote to him. Afterward letters were
frequently exchanged. When Taylor returned from a trip to Europe, he revealed
himself to her, and stated that he would make her his heir.
     About this time we received a letter from a man in Denver, Colorado, who
claimed that he had known the Tanner brothers intimately. This letter stated
that one Edward F. Sands, former secretary to Taylor, was none other than the
missing Denis Gage Deane-Tanner; that at one time William, the older boy, had
won the love of his brother's fiancee, and for many years the younger brother
had hunted the older, swearing vengeance. [24]
     The finger of suspicion had been pointed at Sands early in our
investigations. He had first become involved in the meshes of the law after
Taylor had returned from a trip to England about a year before.
     Taylor reported to the police that Sands had robbed him of money,
jewels, clothing and a costly car. He claimed that there were many
discrepancies in his accounts upon his return. Before going he had signed a
great many checks to be used for current expenses. These checks had been used
by Sands for other purposes, and Taylor's name forged to many others.
     Twice Taylor's home had been burglarized. In the first burglary the
place had been thoroughly ransacked, clothing and much valuable jewelry
taken. The expensive automobile also disappeared at this time, but was later
found in a badly damaged condition.
     Then came a second burglary about two weeks before the murder. At this
time the rear door was smashed in, the place ransacked, but nothing except
jewels and a stock of distinctive cigarettes was taken. [25]
     A week after this burglary Henry Peavey, colored servant, found a gold-
tipped cigarette of this distinctive brand on the front doorstep. He took
this to Mr. Taylor and asked him if he had purchased more of them. Taylor
replied that he had not. The cigarette was undoubtedly some of the stolen
stock.
     Shortly thereafter Taylor received a mysterious letter signed, "Alias
Jimmy Valentine." enclosed in this letter were two pawn-tickets for two
suits, silver plate, jewels and household goods.
     The letter read: "Sorry to inconvenience you, even temporarily. Also
observe the lesson of the forced sale of assets. A Merry Xmas and Happy New
Year. Alias Jimmy Valentine."
     The stolen articles had been pawned under the name of William Deane-
Tanner, showing that the one who had pawned them was familiar with Taylor's
true history. Then penmanship was compared with the handwriting of Sands and
declared by experts to be the same.
     Taylor then swore to a warrant for Sands' arrest, charging him with two
counts of Grand Larceny. [26]
     Could this warrant be construed as a possible motive for the murder? Was
the story of the two brothers true? Surely Sands must have had some hold upon
Taylor. Why the insolent assurance in pawning Taylor's stolen things in the
name of Deane-Tanner and sending the pawn-tickets with the "alias Jimmy
Valentine" letter?
     Was there a skeleton in the family closet? Some dark and secret feud in
the family that could account for the fatal shot?
     The interval elapsing since Taylor's disappearance in 1908 and his
appearance in Hollywood in 1914 had been made the subject of exhaustive
inquiry, but had remained veiled in a cloak of secrecy. [27] What about those
hidden years in Alaska and elsewhere? Had the long arm of the past reached
forth and stricken him down?
     A hot search was then started for Sands. Every police officer and law
enforcing agent in the United States was furnished with a description and a
picture and told to arrest him on sight.
     Records disclosed that Sands had enlisted twice in the United States
Navy, once under the name of Edward F. Sands and again under the name of
Edward F. Strathmore, deserting both times. This was established by
fingerprints on record in the Navy Department, Washington, D. C. [28]
     About this time "dope" was injected into our investigations. Taylor,
himself, was not an addict, but it was rumored that he had attended several
"hop" parties to get atmosphere and local color for his pictures. A number of
his friends, however, including several women, were known drug addicts.
     Taylor was reported as having fought the narcotic ring for some time,
but there was no tangible evidence to connect him in any way until Tom Green,
Assistant United States Attorney, in charge of drug prosecutions, made a
statement to the effect that Taylor had appealed to him for help to effect
the eradication of the "dope ring" which was supplying narcotics to a certain
actress. At that time, according to Taylor, this actress was paying in the
neighborhood of $2,000 a week for narcotics.
     From Chicago came a report that a Chinese dope peddler had murdered
Taylor. Investigation of this report was soon ended when the Chinaman, Harry
Young, alias Harry Lee, was located in Folsom prison. [29]
     One John Narizara was arrested in Toledo, Ohio, and while in jail stated
that he knew who killed Taylor; that it was one Jack Kramer, a Los Angeles
dope peddler. Kramer had confessed the murder to him and when Narizara had
said he was going to tell the police, Kramer and another peddler had
threatened to frame evidence against him as being the slayer. Narizara was
examined by the Lunacy Commission and sent to the Psychopathic Ward. [30]
     One "Red" Kirby was arrested by police officers in a rooming house on
West Washington Street, in Los Angeles, he being a "hophead," and having made
certain remarks, overhead by tenants of the house, these remarks being in
regard to the murder of Taylor, and that Taylor "got what was coming to him."
     Kirby was released when the officers were satisfied that he could not
possibly have had any connection with the murder.
     We delved deep into this phase of the matter, thinking the whole scheme
of the crime might be laid in a setting in which the sale of drugs was the
mainspring.
     Early one morning Captain David Adams, of Central Police Station,
received a telephone call from the editor of a newspaper in the City of Santa
Ana, advising him that if he would send some of his men to Santa Ana, and to
his office, he would give them some information that appeared to be extremely
valuable in connection with the murder of Mr. Taylor.
     Captain Adams called Lieutenant Winn and myself and gave us this
information. Winn was detained in the city on another portion of the
investigation, so Captain Adams and I proceeded to Santa Ana, and to the
office of the editor, who told us the following story:
     On the day prior to our visit, one Andrew Cock, a rancher living near
Santa Ana, came to the newspaper office and reported that on the day before
Taylor was murdered, he, Cock, was going through the town of Tustin,
adjoining Santa Ana, late in the evening. It was raining. Two roughly dressed
men stepped out into the road directly in front of his car, and demanded a
ride. [31]
     Mr. Cock permitted these two men to get into the front seat of the
machine with him, as he was driving a Dodge touring and the rain was beating
into the rear seat of the car.
     On the way from Tustin to Santa Ana these men inquired regarding stages
running between Los Angeles and the Mexican border, especially those leaving
Los Angeles. One of the men, who referred to the other one as "Shorty," began
a conversation concerning a Canadian captain in the World War. He did not
mention any names but stated that this captain had been extremely severe in
discipline, and that they were members of a company in the regiment commanded
by this captain.
     He stated that they were going to Los Angeles to kill this captain,
whereupon "Shorty" told the other man to keep his mouth shut.
     Mr. Cock had been afraid of these men and not wishing to carry them any
farther then he had to, stopped in the main street of Santa Ana and told them
he was not going any farther.
     As the two men left the automobile, "Shorty" dropped a pocket gun which
Mr. Cock described as a short .38 caliber revolver. Mr. Cock started to drive
away. Shorty said, "Wait a minute."
     He then stopped and picked up the gun which had fallen into the muddy
street, took a red bandana handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the gun
off by the light on the cowl board of the machine. It was then that Mr. Cock
had an opportunity to see the gun and determine the caliber.
     Mr. Cock was called to the newspaper office by the editor and again
related the story to us in detail. We made arrangements for him to accompany
us to the border--to Tia Juana and Mexicali--and if possible, to point out
the men, if they still remained in either of the border towns.
     Mr. Cock explained that he had delayed reporting this matter for the
reason that his wife was afraid of what might happen. But, after reading the
story of the murder and that Mr. Taylor had been a Captain in the Canadian
Army during the World War, he felt sure it was Taylor to whom the men had
referred. [32]
     The following day Lieutenant Winn, Cock and myself went to Mexico in
search of these two men. We went to the Chief of Police of Mexicali, who,
after hearing our story, detailed Detective Mendoza, of the Mexicali Police
Force, to accompany us on a round of the saloons, dance halls and other
resorts.
     The Chief informed Mendoza that if Mr. Cock succeeded in locating these
men, or either one of them, he, Mendoza, was to escort us to the border and
put them over as undesirable citizens of Mexicali, and that once across the
border, we could take charge of them.
     We made the rounds of these resorts during the early hours of the
evening. Into one saloon and out, into the dance halls and into gambling
houses--into all sorts of resorts--we went. At last, about 11:00 o'clock, in
a saloon near the famous Owl Resort, Mr. Cock pointed out a young man
standing at the bar with several men and women who were drinking. He stated
that it was his belief that this young man was one of the men that was in the
automobile with him, and who had discussed the killing of the Canadian
captain.
     This man proved to be none other than "Red" Kirby, who had formerly been
arrested by police officers and released.
     Detective Mendoza brought Kirby to the street from the bar room, where
Winn and I started following them towards the line fence between Calexico and
Mexicali. Mendoza finally stopped Kirby and informed him that he was on
Mexican soil; that he did not have to go over the line if he did not wish to
go; that we were detectives from Los Angeles; and that if he went over the
line we would undoubtedly arrest him and take him to Los Angeles. Mendoza
then proceeded to ask Kirby if he wished an attorney to represent him,
stating that if so he would procure one.
     Winn and I then talked for what seemed to be hours with Kirby, trying to
induce him to cross the line to his room in a rooming house in Calexico, not
referring to the Taylor murder, but leading him to believe that we desired to
search his effects in his room, thinking him to have been connected with some
of the numerous burglaries that had been committed in Los Angeles.
     After a great length of time we finally persuaded him to cross the line.
     "Come on, you guys!" he exclaimed, exasperated. "You've got nothing on
me. I'll take you to my room and show you what I got!"
     He then took us to a rooming house where we went through the suitcase
which we found in a closet, and found only a very few articles of wearing
apparel--soiled shirts, ties, a shaving outfit, and other articles of this
nature. No pictures or letters were found.
     We then told Kirby what we really wanted, and turning to Mr. Cock we
asked him if he were positive in his identification of Kirby as being one of
the two men he had picked up in Tustin and carried to Santa Ana.
     Cock looked Kirby over carefully and stated that since he had had an
opportunity to see Kirby under a good light and to hear his voice, he was
convinced that Kirby was not one of the men we were looking for. [33]
     We returned to Los Angeles. Kirby remained in Mexicali where he
continued using "dope"--being a "hop" addict. Some time later his body was
found in what is known as Mexicali wash, back of the town of Mexicali. An
autopsy showed that he had died from an overdose of the narcotic he had been
using. [34]
     When we arrived in Los Angeles we found a letter awaiting us from the
Warden at Folsom Prison, concerning two convicts confined there, who, in the
opinion of the Warden, had committed the murder of Taylor. The Warden had
intercepted notes written by these convicts to each other.
     I was rushed to Folsom Prison.
     When I arrived at Folsom Prison I had a long talk with these two men,
Charles Wadleigh, known as "Solly," and J. G. Barrett, alias "Black Buck" and
"Black Bart."
     "Solly" Wadleigh was a shell shock victim of the World War. He was not
considered mentally responsible at the prison. He impressed me as being
sincere in his statements, however, and not mentally so unbalanced as some
might think. He had been received at Folsom as a recidivist, having been
sentenced to San Quentin from Sacramento to a term of five years to life on a
first degree robbery charge. During his trial he had attempted suicide.
     Barrett, or "Black Bart," impressed me as a person who would stop at
nothing to gain his own ends. He had been badly shot up in attempted escapes,
and carried many ugly wounds to show for it. He appeared to be one of those
conceited, cock-sure individuals with an air that shouts at you, "Suppose I
did commit the crime. It is so well covered up that you will never be able to
prove it!"
     Wadleigh stated that he and Black Bart had been engaged in narcotic
traffic in Los Angeles, and that among their many customers were many movie
stars. Taylor was trying to curb or break up the business of selling dope to
his friends in pictures, with as little notoriety as possible.
     For this interference on the part of Taylor, there was an understanding
of some kind. Two well-known movie stars were in on the deal, and Taylor was
shot and killed by Black Bart after he had had trouble with Taylor.
     Wadleigh stated that on the night of the murder he was ordered by Black
Bart to drive to within a short distance of Taylor's home. When they arrived
Black Bart went in, shot Taylor, and came back at once, picking up one of the
movie stars referred to above, a short distance from the house, and the other
about a block farther on. They drove to 5th and Spring Streets, and on the
way one of the movie stars passed a large roll of money to Black Bart. The
two women then left the car at the corner.
     Wadleigh further stated that Black Bart was getting money from someone
outside the prison all the time--in his opinion from one or both of the two
women--that he had bought his way into the prison hospital for $45.00, which
had been paid to a crooked official, in the hope of escaping.
     Black Bart, according to Wadleigh, was urging him to escape with him for
the reason that he was afraid he would talk if left behind, but Wadleigh felt
sure that once they escaped, Black Bart would murder him to silence him.
     After talking with Wadleigh, I called Black Bart out and had a long talk
with him. At first he was not inclined to talk about the Taylor case, and
appeared greatly frightened at the mention of it. Finally, after much
persuasion, he admitted that he had had a man driving for him, who was in the
same prison, but he would not mention his name as "I never squeal on a
buddy."
     He then admitted that he was near Taylor's home on the night of the
murder; that he did pick up the two movie stars referred to, and that there
was a large sum of money passed between one of them and himself, but he would
not say that he had killed Taylor. He denied that he had killed him, but when
I asked him to be a good fellow and tell me what he had done with the gun, he
said, we could never prove him to be the murderer, and that he would be a
fool to tell us anything or admit his connections with the case.
     He would discuss his life in Los Angeles rather guardedly, and when I
told him he could talk freely of his business, even if it were unlawful, as
there was a statute of limitation, he laughed and replied, "But there is no
statute of limitation for murder."
     He told me that he and Taylor had had trouble on three occasions; that
Taylor was interfering in his business, which was narcotics; that he brought
the stuff into the country from Mexico by airplane; that he did not make
deliveries personally but had others in his employ who did.
     I have neglected to mention that "Solly" Wadleigh had stated that Henry
Peavey could verify his statements as he knew that Black Bart killed Taylor;
that Sands was in on the job and that Bart had killed Sands to silence him
and that he had buried the body, but where he could not say.
     After listening to both stories, which sounded very fishy to me, I
decided to follow them up and make a complete investigation in an effort to
prove or disprove their statements. At the end of my investigations, which
consumed days and days, I was firmly convinced that the one and only
underlying motive behind the whole affair was the desire for escape.
     These two men had been much in each other's company. There was no need
of their writing the notes to each other. Therefore, they had been written
with the expressed purpose in mind that the officials would intercept them.
Both were serving life sentences. A trip to Los Angeles meant an opportunity
to escape. Even if they were not successful, they would have had the trip,
and to a lifer, that much time spent outside the prison walls means much.
     From time to time information regarding the whereabouts of Sands reached
our office. Each clue was followed through to its source.
     A man answering his description had joined an expedition to the Cocos
Island, acting in the capacity of cook. A man of his description committed
suicide in a small town in Kansas. He was seen here, there and everywhere.
     An appeal was made to him through the press to come forward and clear
himself of the murder charge, the D.A.'s office promising not to prosecute on
the various other charges they had against him.
     But Sands never showed up, which is not surprising. A man with a
deserter's record, facing State's prison for forgery, burglary, and grand
larceny, is not anxious to meet up with the police, notwithstanding any
promise of immunity made by the District Attorney.
     On March 16th, 1922, Mary Miles Minter sailed from San Francisco for
Honolulu on the liner Wilhelmina under the name of Miss Juliet Shelby. In
August [May] she returned and there were rumors of a break between her
mother, Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, and herself.
     On August 10th [1923] Miss Minter gave a statement to the press which
confirmed these rumors and revealed her intentions of bringing court action
against her mother in an effort to gain possession of the fortune she had
made while in pictures.
     "The gauntlet is down," Miss Minter is quoted as saying. "I want no
reconciliation with mother. I most assuredly am going to file a legal suit
against her for the return of at least a million dollars which I feel is
rightfully mine. My salary while in motion pictures was more than a million
dollars. Mother has handled all my money, made wise investments and
prospered.
     "I have been the wage earner--the family meal ticket ever since I was
five years old. I wasn't given a chance to get more than three or four years
of actual schooling. Mother was ambitious socially and financially, and I had
to turn beauty and talents into cash.
     "My last contract called for eighteen pictures for which I was to
receive one million, three hundred thousand dollars. When I asked mother for
an accounting, she showed me figures--one hundred and seventy-five thousand
credited to her; one hundred and sixty-five thousand credited to me; all
household expenses for the three of us, mother, my sister Margaret, any
myself, had been deducted from my share.
     "If I wanted ten dollars I had to ask mother for it. I am determined to
live like other people--to live a life unhampered by maternal restrictions. I
am sure there is no real love in my mother's heart for me. I have attained my
majority now, and have reached a point where I am willing to lay my case
before the public to gain my rights."
     When this announcement was made, it was learned that Mrs. Shelby was ill
at the Good Samaritan Hospital. When Mary heard of her mother's illness, she
said, "Just an old ruse of hers. Whenever I have tried to secure a little
freedom, she always flies into hysterics and becomes ill."
     Mrs. Shelby declared that Mary was not capable of handling her own
finances and that she must be protected from herself.
     "Why, Mary cashed her last pay check, one hundred thousand dollars, and
in three months it was all gone!"
     Mary came back with the reply that the pay check only amounted to
$63,000.00; that no sooner had she received it than she invested in Hollywood
real estate which increased in value from $37,000.00 to $65,000.00; that she
paid $7,000 income tax, all her living expenses, and still had some of the
original amount left in the bank.
     To this Mrs. Shelby only replied, "The greatest gift God gave me, I gave
the world--and it devoured her."
     Matters quieted down, Mary saying that she would wait until she was sure
her mother had recovered before she brought suit.
     On Tuesday, August 14th, the name of Miss Minter and her mother, Mrs.
Charlotte Shelby, again occupied the front pages. Mary, for the first time,
bared details of her romance with William Desmond Taylor, stating that they
had, at the time of his death, been engaged. [35]
     "For more than a year and a half I have kept this secret. My love for
William Desmond Taylor was the sweetest and holiest thing in my life," she
said.
     "Any girl would have been proud to be engaged to him as I was. I longed
to tell the truth to the world. There was nothing to be ashamed of in my
love. But, on the advice of my mother, I kept still. I wanted every one to
know that I loved Mr. Taylor with the pure, wholesome love of a young girl.
But the influence of my mother prevented me from making it known at the time
of his death.
     "I loved him the first moment I saw him. Today that love is as strong as
ever--but the continual bitter opposition--he was too old--he was too this--
and he was too that.
     "Even he thought at first that there was too great a difference in our
ages. 'You have brought me the greatest happiness of my life, but you have
come at the time of the setting of the sun, while you are in the glory of
your youth. I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself to a man of my age,' he
said one night when we were planning our future life together.
     "When I was eighteen we were to be married. [36] Then came his death. It
stunned me. At that time all the pressure possible was brought to bear by
those under whose influence I was to see that my engagement was kept secret.
I mustn't talk--it would hurt my career--the same old story of hushing and
shushing. The public must not know that I was engaged. I must be a little
girl with long golden curls. It would never do for them to know that I was a
human being."
     If Miss Minter was stunned by the death of Taylor, her mother was
knocked off her feet by Mary's story. When she read it in the morning paper,
she was overcome--prostrated with grief. Rather than have the family history
aired in court, she announced that she was ready to compromise with her
daughter. Financial matters were adjusted and the two become reconciled.
Their names disappeared from the front pages. Mrs. Shelby went abroad and
Mary went into seclusion.
     District Attorney Woolwine resigned from his office and some time later
passed away. He was succeeded by Asa Keyes, and the investigation continued
in a haphazard sort of way for the next four years. As many as a dozen
persons "confessed" the murder, none of whom could have had anything whatever
to do with it.
     Mr. Keyes finally marked the case closed, and thus it remained until
December 21st, 1929, when Ex-Governor Friend W. Richardson, in an exclusive
interview with a representative of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin, exploded
what the newspapers later referred to as a "detonating political bombshell,"
and dragged the 8-year-old Taylor mystery from the records once more.
     "I know who killed William Desmond Taylor," said the former governor. 
"A motion picture actress killed this director, and I have positive proof to
this effect."
     After going into the history of his differences with Asa Keyes, in 1926,
Richardson said, "About that time, I heard that a prisoner in Folsom knew all
about this murder.
     "I went to Folsom and investigated the case, then went to Los Angeles
where I told the foreman of the Grand Jury and the chairman of the Jury's
criminal committee that I had the solution of the Taylor murder mystery.
     "I asked them whether the facts should be presented to the Grand Jury
and if so, if there was any chance for an indictment. The answer was, 'No.'
They explained that either Keyes or one of his deputies would be in the Grand
Jury room and that before any person could be brought to trial for murder,
the important witnesses would be spirited away, bribed or murdered.
     "I returned to Sacramento, called the Prison Board and explained the
situation. I told them that already the word was around that I had the
solution of the murder, and that unless we took quick action the convict in
Folsom Prison would be murdered.
     "The convict was pardoned by me and the last I heard of him he was in
Vera Cruz, Mexico."
     When asked why he had not presented the facts to Buron Fitts, who
eventually succeeded Asa Keyes as District Attorney, Richardson was quoted as
saying that he "left the Governor's office before Fitts became D.A. Anyway,
the witnesses we had then probably we could not get together now."
     Governor Richardson further claimed that Asa Keyes, who is even now in
the County Jail awaiting the outcome of his appeal on a conviction of
bribery, had "stepped on the case."
     This Keyes from his cell denied, declaring that he was being used as a
political football. He issued a formal statement in which he said:
     "If Richardson has the proof why doesn't he produce his evidence now?
Murder never outlaws. [Murder does not have a statute of limitations.] The
murder happened in nineteen twenty-two when Thomas Lee Woolwine was District
Attorney, and while Buron Fitts and I were both deputies in his office. No
stone was left unturned then or since to uncover the secret of the murder."
     When questioned by representatives of the press regarding this new
development, the present D.A., Buron Fitts, refused to comment other than to
say that he might question Mrs. Charlotte Shelby regarding the matter, as, so
far as he could learn, she was the only one who had never been subjected to a
thorough grilling.
     This remark drew a bitter condemnation from Mrs. Shelby, who, in a
signed statement, asked that she be cleared of all suspicion in connection
with Taylor's death. She said, in part: "After seven years of silence I now
unsolicited give my first published statement regarding reference made to me
in connection with the death of William Desmond Taylor.
     "I feel in justice to myself, my name, my integrity and my rights as a
citizen of the United States, that I must express my indignation at the
injustice done me. I returned from Europe, after three and a half years spent
in search of health, on November seventeenth of this year.
     "I have been maligned, and by innuendo, directly or indirectly,
implicated in connection with the tragedy.
     "There is not a single word of truth in anything that has been said
connecting me with the case, nor has any public official the slightest
evidence which would serve in any way to prove, or even indicate, that I ever
did have, or know information which would lead to the arrest of the person
responsible for Mr. Taylor's death.
     "I have nothing to conceal. I am willing, and have always been, to talk
to any authorized person from the District Attorney's office, and will repeat
to the District Attorney what I am saying now if he wishes to see me.
     "I appeal as a woman of honor and integrity, one who never wronged
anyone, contrary to all reports to the public, for justice and to clear my
name of slander and misrepresentation.
     "I am now establishing my home in Los Angeles.
     "I feel I have a right to live peacefully and enjoy the confidence and
respect of my fellow men." Thus she ended her statement.
     Neither Mrs. Charlotte Shelby, nor her daughter, Mary Miles Minter, have
ever been accused of anything by the District Attorney's office.
     The ex-convict to whom Governor Richardson referred was known to be one
Otis Hefner. Hefner's complete statement was as follows:
     "I came out of Texas, a green and uneducated young fellow in my
twenties, and got in with a bad bunch in Southern California. They were
smarter than I was, and altogether too fast company for me, but I was useful
to them in doing odd jobs, and I can see now they carried me along to make me
the goat.
     "This clique was primarily engaged in the dope racket. There was a lot
of money in it. They got the stuff off the boats at San Pedro and cleared it
through a pharmacy in Los Angeles.
     "One of these crooks was Edward Sands, who had ostensibly worked as a
chauffeur and valet for William Desmond Taylor. Actually, Taylor was
distributing a lot of 'hype' to people in the movie business, including the
actress who committed the murder.
     "Taylor and Sands had a falling out. Taylor left on a trip and when he
returned he publicly accused Sands of robbing his home of clothing and
jewelry. Sands didn't make any pretense of working for Taylor after that, but
I think the robbery was all the bunk, for Sands continued to deliver dope to
Taylor and get his money for it.
     "Sands must have been about forty years old. He was a pretty good sort
of a guy, for a crook. He always treated me square and I always got my money
on time.
     "I met him about six months previous to the murder on a movie location
in Santa Ana Canyon. I was doing some electrical work for the company, and he
drove Taylor out in Taylor's car. We got talking and became friends.
     "Word was passed around in this dope ring that Taylor had turned 'rat'
and was tipping us off to Federal officials. I heard several conversations in
which it was remarked that Taylor would be 'bumped' off if he didn't play
square. At first I paid no attention, as a lot of that sort of talk was going
around; but they kept repeating it and pretty soon I got really interested
and began to think they meant business.
     "On the evening of February 1st, 1922, Sands and I were out at Redondo
Beach on a job and saw Taylor and two motion picture actresses having dinner
at a cafe.
     "We went back to town and Sands went to his apartment for a few minutes,
while I waited outside. He told me when he came down that he had just talked
with Taylor on the telephone, at Taylor's home, and that we were to deliver
some 'hype' to the latter.
     "Sands went and got a big limousine, which he said was Taylor's and had
been loaned to him. He picked up his stuff at the pharmacy, and we drove out
to Alvarado Street.
     "This was about two o'clock in the morning. We parked the car across the
street from Taylor's bungalow court. Sands and I left it and crossed Alvarado
Street. There was another limousine at the opposite curb, with a driver at
the wheel and the motor going. A woman was coming down the short steps from
the entrance to the bungalow court. She was wrapped in a fur coat, either
black or dark brown. I recognized her.
     "She passed Sands and me and got into the limousine hurriedly, and drove
away. [37]
     "Sands told me to wait for him on the sidewalk, while he went in with
the bundle. He came back almost immediately and hurriedly crossed the street
to our car, motioning me to step lively with him. As we left the curb I
noticed a man in the bungalow court at the rear, adjoining Taylor's home, but
directly facing Alvarado Street, open the shutters of a window and look out.
I read in the papers afterward that this was Douglas MacLean's home.
     "When we were in the car, Sands said to me: 'It's time to be going. The
old man's got his. He's stretched out deader than a mackerel.'
     "We went downtown and separated. I went to Santa Ana and later to San
Pedro. I went back to Los Angeles next Saturday evening to find out what was
going on and ran into Sands. I saw him next day, too. He was leaving for San
Pedro to take a boat for Mexico, and told me where to reach him at Vera Cruz.
     "I exchanged several letters with him at Vera Cruz after that. He kept
telling me to keep my mouth shut and not to mention his name.
     "Sands did not kill Taylor; I'm sure of that. I don't think he meant to
run away when he started to Mexico; I understand he was going to arrange for
more narcotic shipments.
     "It think Taylor was shot down between about 1:45 a.m. when Sands and he
talked together on the telephone, and 2:30 a.m. when we beat it from the
Alvarado Street address. "I did not travel with the gang after that, and,
having lost the guiding hand of Sands, I got into several jams and was sent
to Folsom. At the prison I told something of this to Buck Cook, who squealed
to the prison officials.
     "Thomas Gannon of the prison board then called me and asked me what I
knew about the Taylor murder."
     Shortly after Governor Richardson made his startling charges, Otis
Hefner was found by a newspaper reporter, living under the name of Arthur
Nelson, in Redwood City, California. Hefner repeated his story as told above,
stating that both he and Sands had positively identified the motion picture
actress seen rushing from the apartment.
     No sooner had the Taylor case resumed its place on the front pages than
Henry Peavey, ex-servant and valet of Taylor, was located in Sacramento.
While Hefner's story covered events immediately after the murder. Peavey told
a story purporting to reveal what had happened the preceding evening while
Taylor was still alive.
     "I went to [sic] Taylor's home about 7:00 o'clock in the evening. I
wanted to check out for the day. When I got to the door of the room I heard
loud talking inside and hesitated to go in.
     "I recognized the voice of the girl, who was a prominent motion picture
actress and who had formerly been on much more friendly terms with Mr.
Taylor.
     "I had an appointment downtown, so after waiting for about ten minutes,
I knocked on the door and opened it. I saw Taylor and the actress. I told
Taylor I was leaving, closed the door, and went out, leaving them together.
     "I learned later from Taylor's chauffeur that he phoned the house at
7:20 and got no response, and when he found the place dark later, he went on
home.
     "The murder was evidently committed then, between 7:10 and 7:20 p.m. and
Taylor's body was found next morning in the room where I left him with the
actress. [38]
     "I know she was very angry with him because he did not care so much for
her as he once did, and was paying attention to another motion picture
actress."
     When Peavey had finished his story he assured his questioners that he
was eager to come to Los Angeles and tell his story to the Grand Jury.
     "You didn't tell this same story at the Coroner's inquest?"
     "No, they wouldn't let me. They tried to shake my story. They threatened
me. I didn't change my story, but I left out the part about the row at Mr.
Taylor's."
     "What do you mean by 'they'?"
     "The District Attorney's office."
     We placed no stock in Peavey's statements. We had questioned him
thoroughly a number of times immediately following the murder, and he had
never told us any story that would indicate that Taylor had been murdered by
a motion picture actress.
     I am sure that he told everything he knew at the beginning. He was the
pride of Central Avenue at the time (Los Angeles' Negro belt)--bought himself
a new pair of spats, and became the most important person in town in his own
estimation. If he had known more he would have sprung it for the added glory
and glamour.
     There were those who thought he was concealing something at first. But,
after some newspaper boys took him to the cemetery and sweated him over a
gravestone, and couldn't get any more out of him, they were satisfied. [39]
     As for the District Attorney's office not allowing him to testify to the
full facts at the coroner's inquest, I don't believe he could have testified
to anything correctly at the inquest. He took one look at Taylor's body,
became half hysterical, and his chin shook so that we could hear his teeth
chatter all the way across the inquest room.
     We had no more confidence in the story told by Hefner than the one told
by Peavey. In my opinion he had concocted his story of events in the Taylor
mystery from reading newspapers and discussing the crime with other prisoners
for the sole purpose of effecting his release, and so successful had he been
in convincing Governor Richardson of the authenticity of his statements, that
the executive paroled him in 1925. Hefner violated this parole, was sent back
to prison, only to be re-paroled again in 1926.
     But, not wishing to leave any stone unturned, my boss, District Attorney
Buron Fitts, ordered me to go north for an interview with Hefner.
     On Friday afternoon, January 10th, 1930, I took the Owl train to San
Francisco, where I interviewed Mr. Crissey and Mr. George Powers, of the
Daily News, as it was they to whom Hefner had told his latest story.
     Hefner, they stated, was living at 205 Redwood Avenue, Redwood City,
which is located on the peninsula some thirty-five miles south of San
Francisco.
     Mr. Powers explained that one Tommy Jones, who had been living with
Hefner, and working with him at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, of San
Mateo, California, was thought to be the missing Edward F. Sands.
     Jones, who, according to Mr. Powers, fitted the description of Sands,
had, within the last few days, disappeared from his hotel and his place of
employment. There was a portion of his salary due at the company office,
which Jones had failed to collect.
     On Saturday afternoon, January 12th, I took a machine from San Francisco
and drove to San Mateo, then to Hefner's home in Redwood City. While in San
Mateo I went to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and talked with R. W.
Briggs, gang foreman of the electric lines, who explained to me that Tommy
Jones had been employed as a lineman and worked under his supervision.
     Mr. Briggs produced his time book which showed Jones had not quit his
job within the last few days, but on December 6th, 1929; and stated that the
description of Sands did not fit the description of Jones in any way, Jones
being a much younger man.
     I showed Mr. Briggs the picture I had of Edward F. Sands. Mr. Briggs
called several linemen who knew Tom Jones very well, and all stated that the
picture of Sands could not possibly be the picture of Jones.
     Mr. Briggs also explained that Tom Jones was an extremely ignorant man;
that he could scarcely read or write, and had trouble signing his own name.
He was a Southerner and spoke with a distinct southern drawl, talking
continually of coon hunting and 'possum hunting in the South. Jones, when he
left the employ of the gas company, had stated that he was taking his wife
and two children to the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona.
     I then went to the St. James Hotel where Jones had formerly lived and
was told by the landlady and several of the roomers that Jones couldn't
possibly be Edward F. Sands.
     Having established conclusively that there could be nothing to the Sands
story as concerned Tom Jones, I proceeded to the Hefner home in Redwood City,
where I found the house locked up with the curtains all pulled down. The mail
box contained mail from several days.
     I returned to San Francisco for the night, but early the next morning I
again set out for Redwood City, determined to watch the house of Hefner for
his return. About 9:00 a.m. I telephoned Edward Whyte, State Parole Officer,
and he informed me that if I would come immediately to his office in the
Ferry Building, San Francisco, he would produce Hefner for me, as Hefner was
in hiding at Whyte's suggestion to keep away from newspaper men.
     I went directly to Whyte's office and after a few moments' conversation
he brought Otis Hefner from an adjoining room.
     Tall, lean and bronzed, there was little about Hefner to suggest the ex-
convict. No trace of prison pallor was left and the deep tan of his face gave
his eyes an intense appearance.
     Hefner started to repeat the story he had told the newspapers, but
before he had talked two minutes, I was convinced that he couldn't possibly
know anything of the details of this murder.
     "Hefner," I said, "you're lying to me. When you first told your famous
yarn to Ex-Governor Richardson, you lied. After you told your first lie,
you've been forced to tell a thousand others to cover up. Now, come clean. Am
I right?"
     A broad smile--a sigh of relief--tears trickling down his cheeks--then
Hefner replied:
     "Yes, King, you are right. I told a lie to get out of Folsom Prison and
I've been compelled to tell many others to keep out. I have been working hard
since my release to re-establish myself as a good citizen. My wife has been
sick. We are paying for our little home and it just about takes all I earn.
During the three years I have been out, I have never left home except during
working hours."
     After several further remarks, I decided I did not wish to interview him
any further, but I wanted him to tell his story first-hand to Mr. Fitts. He
agreed to go to Los Angeles with me provided I would agree to keep the
newspaper men and cameras away from him.
     He explained that he did not want his wife to know of his former prison
record. She was seated in his machine with their young baby out in front of
the Ferry Building. He wanted me to go down to the machine with him and
explain that he must go to Los Angeles with me, but merely as a witness in an
important matter. He asked me to avoid all mention of his past life.
     This I did, meeting Mrs. Hefner and the baby. We made arrangements for
Hefner to take the wife and baby to the home of Mrs. Hefner's sister in
Oakland, there to remain until his return to San Francisco.
     Mr. Whyte, parole officer, confirmed his statements, adding that Hefner
had accounted to him for every penny of the money he had earned at hard labor
for the past three years; had lived a straightforward and upright life ever
since his release on parole; and regardless of his fake story, he thought
justice could best be served by allowing him to return to his wife and baby,
so, after a talk with the District Attorney, we furnished him transportation
and allowed him to return home.
     With the revivified search for a solution of the eight-year-old mystery
of who killed William Desmond Taylor, came other "confessions" from all over
the country.
     A man in Birmingham, Alabama, confessed that he had been an eyewitness
to the murder. He claimed to have been hidden behind the piano in Taylor's
apartment where he had sought refuge, when Taylor and a woman whom he named
entered.
     This woman soon left and a second woman entered, dressed as a man.
Taylor reprimanded her for masquerading and they argued over the woman's
demand for money. Taylor gave her a check which she tore to bits.
     As she was about to leave, the "confession" continued, this woman drew a
gun and shot Taylor. By shifting his position, he could see Taylor as he
slumped down in his chair and crumpled to the floor.
     This "confession" was highly imaginative, practically improbable and
undoubtedly false. The piano in Taylor's living room was a small baby grand
model and it would have been next to impossible for anyone to hide behind it
and escape detection. We examined the room for hiding-places and eliminated
the piano the first day of the inquiry. There was not a place in the room
where a man could possibly have remained hidden.
     There were many other discrepancies in his story. He described a
vestibule and there was no vestibule. He described Taylor's desk as a
"colonial" style desk, while in reality it was a small roll top desk with
pigeonholes.
     Whoever murdered Taylor slipped in through the front door when Taylor
accompanied Mabel Normand from his home to her waiting automobile.
     When Taylor re-entered the house, his murderer stepped out from behind
the partially open front door and shot him from behind. This fact alone
proved the falsity of his story, which he had so constructed that the
assailant had to shoot from in front.
     Since the re-opening of the case, we have been receiving as high as 100
letters a day, coming all the way from the Yukon on the North and Florida on
the South.
     And, it is remarkable how many persons in the United States have vital
information concerning the murder. I don't understand how they've kept their
secrets locked up in the breasts for the past eight years.
     All they need is an opportunity to come to Los Angeles, and according to
their letters, the mystery would be solved. I might add that we are expected
to pay the freight both ways.
     Today the Taylor case is listed among the great unsolved crime mysteries
of the world, the chances being good that it will stay there.
     Dope, love, jealousy, revenge, blackmail--all have entered into our
investigations.
     There was never a particle of real evidence to connect Taylor with a
dope ring.
     The only way love and jealousy entered into the case was through the
admission of Mary Miles Minter, who confessed unashamedly that she loved
William Desmond Taylor.
     Never, for one moment, have I suspected Mabel Normand of knowing
anything about the murder. I questioned her many times when she was
completely off her guard. If she had known anything, the truth would have
come out.
     The revenge motive was found only in connection with Sands. Taylor had
threatened his arrest and filed charges against him.
     Taylor's unlocked home and his way of living without a retinue of
servants made it comparatively easy for his slayer to enter his bungalow,
shoot him and get away without leaving a single clue.
     As stated in the opening paragraph of my story, almost from the first
hour of my investigation, I have known who committed this murder. But knowing
it and proving it are two separate things. However. I am a great believer in
the law of retribution, and I feel positive that some day this law will make
good in the case of William Desmond Taylor. [40]

NOTES:
[1] Edna Purviance did not live in the same building as Taylor. Taylor lived
in apartment 404B and the other unit in his building was 404A. Edna Purviance
lived in 402A, in the building directly to the west of Taylor. See LOS
ANGELES EXAMINER (February 12, 1922). Other early press reports also
indicated that she lived in the next building.
[2] According to Peavey's testimony at the coroner's inquest, he arrived at
Taylor's home at 7:30 a.m.
[3] According to Peavey's testimony at the coroner's inquest, he brought a
bottle of milk of magnesia which he had obtained at a drug store, and picked
up the newspaper (not milk bottle) from Taylor's doorstep before opening the
door.
[4] Peavey testified at the inquest that "a chair that was sitting next to
the wall had been pushed out a little bit and his feet was under this chair."
The chair was not overturned. A diagram of the crime scene in the Los Angeles
Record (February 2, 1922) had the chair upright and astride one of Taylor's
legs. On February 10, District Attorney Woolwine returned to the crime scene
with E.C. Jessurun, the first person to actually enter the room that morning,
and a photo was posed in the exact same position as the body was originally
found; again, the chair is astride the left leg and not overturned. See LOS
ANGELES EXAMINER (February 11, 1922). Also see Sidney D. Kirkpatrick, A CAST
OF KILLERS (Dutton, 1986), p. 164.
[5] King's description of the path of the bullet is highly inaccurate.
According to the testimony of the coroner at the inquest, the bullet entered
Taylor's left side and travelled upward, lodging near the base of the right
side of his neck.
[6] Taylor's apartment was too small for a baby grand piano. Press reports,
diagrams, photos of the murder scene, and Taylor's probate documents all
agree that the piano was an upright.
[7] The actual inscription read: "For William Desmond Taylor-Artist,
Gentleman, Man. Sincere good wishes. Mary Miles Minter. -1920-". A
reproduction of the photo can be seen in the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February
4, 1937).
[8] Nevertheless, rumors of the robbery motive persisted. On the afternoon
before his death Taylor had met with his income tax advisor, J. Marjorie
Berger. She told reporters that Taylor had shown her a large roll of bills he
had with him at that time, a roll much larger than the at $78.00 found on
his body the next morning. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 17, 1922).
[9] This rumor of a large withdrawal was reportedly discredited, and it was
found that the deposit was primarily Taylor's paychecks, and not cash. See
LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 15, 1922, reprinted in WILLIAM DESMOND TAYLOR:
A DOSSIER, pp. 380-1).
[10] Mabel Normand did not return to Taylor's apartment on the day the body
was found. She first returned there after the inquest on February 4, to show
the detectives how the furniture had been arranged during her last visit with
Taylor.
[11] Although there was a press report to this effect, there was also an
interview where Minter denied any knowledge of an engagement between Taylor
and Normand. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 3, 1922).
[12] There were also authoritative reports that the nightgown had no initials.
See LOS ANGELES TIMES (February 4, 1937, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, p. 369).
[13] Press reports of the time indicated that it was Mabel Normand's letters,
missing for the week following the murder, which were found in the toe of
Taylor's boot, having been planted there by Charles Eyton who had earlier
removed them from the apartment. Two coded love letters from Mary Miles
Minter were found earlier by reporters, and there was no indication that they
were signed. Photos of two of the letters were reproduced in the Hearst
press. Minter later admitted writing the letters to Taylor, during 1919.
See Minter's statement reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 11.
[14] Taylor had eaten the evening meal at 6:30, and Peavey was just cleaning
up afterwards when Mabel Normand arrived.
[15] Most of Mabel Normand's own statements indicated that she did not enter
Taylor's apartment until after he had finished the telephone conversation.
There was no mention elsewhere of her dropping peanut shells on Taylor's
floor, and it seems doubtful based on other reporting of the scene.  She did
drop peanut shells in her car while her chauffeur was driving her to
Taylor's, and perhaps King has confused the incidents.
[16] In her own statement to the press, Edna Purviance said she was not home
that evening, and did not come home until 11:45 p.m., when she noticed the
light burning in Taylor's apartment. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (February 12,
1922).
[17] Although King evidently believes Taylor was seated at his desk when the
shot was fired, other investigators concluded Taylor was standing when he was
shot. See A CAST OF KILLERS, p. 164, and LOS ANGELES RECORD (March 27, 1926,
reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, p. 365).
[18] According to Mrs. MacLean's statements, when she first saw the man he was
standing outside of Taylor's door. See SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER (February 6,
1922, reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 333-5).
[19] The man walked towards Maryland St., not Fourth Street.
[20] The preceding is undoubtedly a reference to Mary Miles Minter. Although
King indicates Minter's late-night visit to Taylor took place two days prior
to the murder, other statements in the police file indicate her visit took
place several days or weeks earlier; see WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 328-329 and
TAYLOROLOGY 7 (Robertson's statement indicates that Taylor related this
incident to Hoyt on the previous Saturday [January 28] which would mean that
the incident described took place earlier). It's possible that Minter's visit
took place in December 1921; see LOS ANGELES TIMES (August 15, 1925,
reprinted in WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 254-5).
[21] King gives the impression that this "psychic's phone call" story was
given to the press a few days after the murder, but it actually happened
eight months later. See LOS ANGELES TIMES (October 4, 1922). This was the
first rumor to appear in the newspapers implying Shelby had killed Taylor.
[22] The biography which follows is primarily from studio sources, and
contains various errors, including the wrong date for Taylor's birth.  Taylor
was in the British, not Canadian, Army (see TAYLOROLOGY 40).
[23] Although Ada Tanner had seen Taylor but once in California, she
previously had seen him in New York.
[24] For the complete tale, see DENVER POST, (February 10, 1922). Denis Deane-
Tanner could not possibly be Edward Sands. See CHIGAGO HERALD-EXAMINER
(February 8, 1922) and LOS ANGELES TIMES (February 3, 1937, both reprinted in
WDT: DOSSIER pp. 392-393).
[25] This burglary was on December 4, two months before the murder.
[26] The warrant charging Sands with grand larceny was issued in July 1921,
after the first theft by Sands. See WDT: DOSSIER, p. 318, and TAYLOROLOGY 19.
[27] See TAYLOROLOGY 29 for information on Taylor's whereabouts between 1908
and 1912.
[28] The earlier Navy enlistment was reportedly under the name of Edward F.
Snyder, not Sands. Sands had also deserted from the U.S. Army under the name
of Strathmore, and also had enlisted in the U. S. Coast Guard.  See
TAYLOROLOGY 19.
[29] Press reports indicate Harry Young, alias Harry Lee, was located in
Folsom prison in 1930 but that he had been in Los Angeles at the time of the
Taylor murder. Lee's 1922 cellmate reportedly said Lee had confessed killing
Taylor for $1000 on behalf of a drug gang. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (January 6,
1930). Lee was found at Folsom, denied killing Taylor, and said that he was
one of the first arrested as a suspect in the murder but was released after
three days. See SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE (January 7, 1930). Lee's earlier
arrest was reported on March 3, 1922, indicating Lee had a quantity of
cocaine, opium and drug paraphernalia, plus a .38 caliber pistol; it was
reported that he was questioned about the Taylor murder but denied any
knowledge of it. See LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (March 4, 1922).
[30] The individual King calls "John Narizara" was referred to in the press as
"John Marazino." See LOS ANGELES EXPRESS (December 20, 1922).
[31] For the original newspaper account of this item, see SANTA ANA REGISTER
(February 17 and 18, 1922). Those press items say the incident took place on
January 30, which was two days prior to the murder.
[32] Of course, the reports that Taylor was a captain in the Canadian army,
were erroneous. He was in the British army.
[33] Upon his return, Andrew Cock was again interviewed by the SANTA ANA
REGISTER (March 18, 1922). He reportedly stated that he was uncertain as to
whether or not Kirby was the man he saw earlier.
[34] Walter Kirby's death was reported in the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER (May 3,
1922).  Contemporary press articles refer to Kirby as having the nickname
"Whitey," not "Red."
[35] This interview revealing her "engagement" was from the LOS ANGELES
EXAMINER. But in her written statement to the LOS ANGELES TIMES (August 15,
1923), she wrote: "We were never engaged in the sense that he had asked me to
marry him and I had promised. I had always hoped that sometime we would be
married. But I had planned in my own mind-never with Mr. Taylor--that as soon
as I had made enough money so that mother and sister could be assured of a
comfortable income for the rest of their lives--that perhaps we would be
married. But not engaged in the sense of wearing a ring, or of telling one's
friends of an intention to marry or of telling my mother. Marrying Mr. Taylor
was just my dream--a dream which, voiced to film, always met with the answer
that it was impossible."
[36] Minter was nineteen when Taylor died, further indication that much of
this "interview" was probably fabricated by the reporter.
[37] This obviously was supposed to be Mabel Normand.
[38] The time of 7:20 p.m. for the telephone call of Taylor's chauffeur was
given in a second-hand account. When Peavey was interviewed by reporters
directly he said the unanswered call was at 7:30. Peavey had stated at the
inquest that he left Taylor's apartment at about a quarter past seven, so
that would place the time of death between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m., if Peavey were
correct. The actress referred to by Peavey is obviously Mabel Normand.
King's account omits Peavey's statement that the woman and Taylor were loudly
arguing.
[39] King is wrong here, and his attempt to discredit Peavey does not stand up
to impartial examination. The 1922 press evidence clearly does show that
Peavey told the authorities he thought Normand killed Taylor. See LOS ANGELES
RECORD (February 20, 1922). Peavey expressed the same opinion to the Hearst
reporters who abducted him. See SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER (February 21, 1922),
and CHICAGO AMERICAN (February 20 and 21, 1922, reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 22
and 23). During that abduction, he also told of the argument he witnessed
between Taylor and Normand. See LOS ANGELES HERALD (February 20, 1922). That
argument was hinted at in Mabel Normand's own statement to reporters. See LOS
ANGELES EXAMINER (February 15, 1922, reprinted in TAYLOROLOGY 6). In Peavey's
1930 statement to the press he said he had no knowledge as to what the
argument was about. See LOS ANGELES RECORD (January 7, 1930).
[40] From the context of the article it is clear King thought Charlotte
Shelby, dressed in man's clothing, was the person who murdered Taylor.
