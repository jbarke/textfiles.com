(b) The facts and rumors of Taylor's murder; (c) The impact of the Taylor
murder on Hollywood and the nation. Primary emphasis will be given toward
reprinting, referencing and analyzing source material, and sifting it for
accuracy.

                        The Case Against Edward Sands:
 
     From the very beginning, Edward F. Sands was a prime suspect in Taylor's
murder and several of the investigators on the case were convinced of his
guilt. Yet A CAST OF KILLERS and A DEED OF DEATH quickly shrug off the
possibility that Sands killed Taylor. Nevertheless, the case against Sands is
substantial, and any thorough consideration of the Taylor case must include a
much closer look in Sands' direction.
 
 *****************************************************************************
 
                                Who was Sands?
                                       
     Edward Sands' real name was Edward Fitzgerald Snyder. [1]  For several
months he also went under the alias of Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore.
Military fingerprints confirmed that Snyder and Strathmore were the same
person; handwriting analysis confirmed that Snyder, Strathmore and Sands were
all the same person. [2]
 
     Edward Fitzgerald Snyder was born in Marion, Ohio on April 4, 1894, the
son of Murray T. Snyder and Marguerite A. Snyder. Edward had many brothers and
sisters, and the family home was at 572 Silver St., Marion, Ohio.
     Edward Snyder first enlisted in the U.S. Navy on September 19, 1911, at
the Navy Recruiting Station in Cincinnati. He had run away from home and was
only 17, but he lied about his age and said he was 18, giving his birthdate as
1893. He entered as an Apprentice Seaman; in 1912 he attended Yeoman School
and was subsequently promoted to Yeoman 3rd Class in 1912, Yeoman 2nd Class in
1913, and Yeoman 1st Class in 1914. He served on the U.S.S. Franklin, U.S.S.
Constellation, U.S.S. Montana, and U.S.S. Paducah. His duty assignments
included Pay Office, and Canteen Yeoman. In mid-1915, while on board the
U.S.S. Paducah, he was arrested and charged with fraud and embezzlement. The
general court martial was held at the Navy Yard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Snyder was found guilty and sentenced to be reduced in rank to the rating of
Landsman and to perform one year of hard labor, then to be discharged. He was
confined to the navy prison aboard the U.S.S. Southery at the Navy Yard in
Portsmouth and was dishonorably discharged on August 6, 1916.
     Two weeks later, on August 21, 1916, Snyder enlisted again, this time at
Boston, Massachusetts, in the U.S. Coast Guard as an Ordinary Seaman. On his
enlistment form he fraudulently declared that he had never received a
dishonorable discharge from any service, and that he had no previous military
service. Although he entered as an Ordinary Seaman, he was "disrated [reduced
in rank] to Boy 1st Class at his own request" on September 1, 1916. On
December 4 he was promoted to Cabin Steward and held that rank until his
discharge. He served on the cutter Gresham from the time of his enlistment
until his honorable discharge on August 20, 1917, a full year's service.
     On October 17, 1917, Snyder enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve at the
Navy Yard in New York, NY, service number 193-31-03. (During World War I, the
U.S. Naval Reserve had been mobilized into active service.) He entered as a
Ship's Cook, 2nd Class, and was sent to the Naval Reserve Training Station at
Pelham Park, New York. While there, he was promoted to Commissary Steward on
February 1, 1918. In April 1918 Snyder was transferred to the Naval District
Base at New London, Connecticut, and on December 1 he was promoted to Chief
Commissary Steward. He was placed in charge of the commissary department at
P. A. Scott & Co., salvagers. One night he stole an automobile belonging to
Albert Mix, a member of the Scott firm. Snyder wrecked the car, smashing it
into a telegraph pole. He was arrested and let off on the condition that he
pay for the damages incurred. He said he could get the money in New York, and
was given permission to go there.  He left the Naval Base on January 14, 1919
and never returned, sending back word that "they would have to come after it"
if they wanted the money. Snyder had deserted for the first time. [3]
     On February 8, 1919, Snyder enlisted at Kansas City in the U.S. Navy
again, but this time under the name Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore; he
accomplished the change of name by presenting the recruiter with a forged
certificate of honorable discharge from the U.S. Coast Guard, in Strathmore's
name.  "Strathmore" was assigned to the Naval Training Station at Great
Lakes, Illinois, service number 341-01-01, and he entered as a Landsman for a
Cook. In March 1919 the Navy Department in Washington discovered that
Strathmore was really the same person as Edward Snyder who had previously
been dishonorably discharged from the Navy in 1916. (But the Navy Department
was at that time unaware of Snyder's two interim enlistments in the Coast
Guard and Naval Reserve, or the fact that he was currently wanted as a
deserter.) On April 1, 1919 he was summoned to the office of his commander,
confronted with his previous dishonorable discharge, instructed to secure the
necessary affidavits showing his correct name and date of birth, and to make
a written statement explaining his motive for reinlisting. Snyder/Strathmore
responded by deserting again. [4]
     Snyder's next stop was the U.S. Coast Guard, enlisting again under the
name of Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore, as a Cook on April 17, 1919 at
Brooklyn, N.Y., service number 144-441  He was sent to USCG Station #239 at
Cleveland, Ohio on April 18. He repeatedly went absent without leave during
his month there, and on May 18, 1919, he deserted again.
     "Strathmore" next enlisted in the U.S. Army at Columbus Barracks, Ohio,
on May 22, 1919, service number 6-428-758. He was soon assigned to the finance
office, and on August 25 he was promoted to sergeant. One of his duties was
the drawing up of government checks for payment of bills.  On October 4 he
made out a check payable to himself for $481.53, forged the signature of the
finance officer, and deserted, also forging a signature to an army discharge
for himself.  After deserting he attempted to buy a motorcycle with the forged
check.
     Snyder now adopted the name Edward F. Sands, and by mid-1920 had obtained
the job of valet and cook to William Desmond Taylor in Los Angeles. In July
1921, while Taylor was in Europe and Sands had been left to take care of
Taylor's home, Sands forged checks on Taylor's account, wrecked Taylor's car,
stole some of Taylor's clothing, and vanished. When Taylor returned he issued
a formal complaint against Sands, and a police warrant was issued by the
L.A.P.D., charging Sands with forgery and larceny.
     One newspaper quoted Snyder's father as stating that three months prior
to the murder (which would have been around the beginning of November 1921)
Edward Snyder had visited his sister, Mrs. George Dunn, in Cleveland,
Ohio. [5]
     On November 17, 1921, Snyder enlisted once again under his real name, in
the U.S. Coast Guard at Oakland, and was assigned to the cutter Bear as a Mess
Attendant 1st Class, service number 143-512. On November 26, Snyder was
dismissed from his enlistment and discharged for being absent without leave.
(This discharge was technically an ordinary discharge, for "unsatisfactory
probationary period.")
     On December 4, 1921, Taylor's home was burglarized. The back door was
broken in and several items of Taylor's jewelry were stolen, along with his
entire stock of special gold-tipped cigarettes. Some food was eaten from the
refrigerator and dusty footprints were found on Taylor's bed. The stolen
jewelry was pawned in Fresno on December 12, and in Sacramento on
December 24; the person pawning the jewelry was identified as Edward Sands,
which was confirmed by handwriting analysis. Sands either committed the
burglary, or it was committed by his associate who then turned the stolen
merchandise over to Sands. [6]  In mid-December a gold-tipped cigarette was
found on Taylor's doorstep, indicating that Sands had returned once again. On
December 27, both pawn tickets were mailed to Taylor from Stockton, with a
note that read: "So sorry to inconvenience you even temporarily. Also observe
the lesson of the forced sale of assets. A Merry Xmas and a happy and
prosperous New Year.  Alias Jimmy V." Handwriting analysis confirmed the note
was written by Sands/Snyder/Strathmore.
     There were many reported and rumored sightings of Sands after this time,
but his whereabouts after the murder were never confirmed. [7]  Regarding his
military service, he is known to have enlisted seven times: four times he
deserted and twice he was kicked out. Only one of his seven enlistments was
satisfactorily completed.

                                                             February 3, 1922
                                                            LOS ANGELES TIMES
     [from an interview with Julia Crawford Ivers]...Mrs. Ivers then told of
the difficulty Mr. Taylor said he had with his valet-secretary, Sands.
     "There never was a more devoted man serving another than this man Sands
during the first year and a half of his service for Mr. Taylor.  Mr. Taylor
trusted him with everything.
     "...Sands read everything he could find. He used to study into the late
hours of the night and when Mr. Taylor told me of the various actions
attributed to Sands, we all decided the man must have become deranged..."

     (Los Angeles)--...Captain of Police R. Moffatt said today, "We are
seeking Sands for any information that he can throw upon the subject [of
Taylor's murder]. The only possible motive thus far uncovered is that of
putting out of the way a complaining witness in two felony cases. Sands was
accused of felony by Taylor."

                                                          LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
     ...Of almost equal interest in the development of the investigation was
the statement of Mrs. Earl Tiffany, wife of Taylor's chauffeur, that she saw
Edward F. Sands, ex-secretary-valet of the murdered director, now sought as a
witness, at Sixth and Figueroa Streets Tuesday afternoon last [the day prior
to the murder] at 1:20 o'clock.
     ...The search for Sands continued with unabated intensity. He is said to
have returned to Los Angeles Tuesday and uttered this threat:
     "I am here to get Bill Taylor."
     His intimate knowledge of Taylor's double identity was revealed in
startling fashion late yesterday when in Fresno it was learned that Sands had
there pawned jewelry stolen from Taylor and that he had given the name
"William Deane-Tanner," asserted to be Taylor's true name.
     ...The police are assured beyond peradventure that the man who pawned the
jewelry in Fresno, using the true name of the owner in a spirit of malicious
triumph, was Edward Sands.
     There is something in this very circumstance which to the officers is
itself a flood of light coming out of the darkness.
     The stealing and forgery indulged in by Sands did not convey the spirit
of this piece of treachery; they might have been only for gain. But now that
the Fresno episode is brought up from the obscurity of a dark little hole-in-
the-wall pawn shop to be made plain in all its details, a new element appears.
     This new element is the pronounced unfriendliness of Sands, which takes
on the aspect of a sinister and silent threat.
     The malice is further revealed in what seems to have been a persistent
campaign of Sands to annoy the director.
     From Fresno he sent him a pawn ticket, a ticket issued on valuables
stolen from Taylor on which money had been raised.
     Still another pawn ticket came through the mail from Sacramento. With
this was the letter signed "Alias Jimmy V."
     These were derisive thrusts at Taylor; from some motive which has not
been revealed the thief and forger was trying to torture the victim of his
crimes.
     ...Something of the description of this man was learned yesterday by The
Examiner from A. A. Tomlinson, an accountant of 1022 West Fortieth Place.
     "The true name of this man," said Tomlinson, "is not Sands but
Strathmore. I recognized him by his picture in this morning's Examiner.
     "He enlisted in the army during the war as Edward Fitz Strathmore and was
assigned to Columbus Barracks, Ohio. I was then head of the finance office and
upon learning that Strathmore had been a chief petty officer in the navy I
asked that he be transferred to my department, which was done.
     "On October 4, 1919, Strathmore forged my name to a Government check for
$475 and tried to buy a motorcycle with it. He failed to carry out this
scheme, but escaped. At the same time he forged the commanding officer's name
to a discharge. He has been wanted for desertion.
     "On July 4, 1920, I met him on Alvarado Street. He told me that he was
expecting to get work with the street car company. I notified the police, but
he disappeared.
     "During his service with me at Columbus Barracks, Strathmore often
boasted of the crimes he had committed. I did not believe him then, but
thought it was a case of a young fellow drawing on his imagination.
     "Once I asked him what he would do if he were in a dangerous situation.
He said he would shoot his way out."

both Sands and Peavey are of a queer type, affected, given to feminine ways.

     (Los Angeles)--...The police continued their search for Edward F. Sands,
a former secretary and valet to Taylor.
     According to the statement of one person made to the police, this man was
in Los Angeles not later than last Tuesday, the day before the murder was
committed. He is alleged to have made a statement to this person that "I am
out to get Taylor--and I will get him."
     Before the murder police were directing a search for this man on the
complaint of Taylor, who charged that he had robbed him of several thousand
dollars. It seemed to enrage Sands, according to friends, to think that his
former employer objected to being the victim of a robbery by his personal
servant and he fled from Los Angeles breathing vengeance against Taylor, it is
alleged.

                                                          LOS ANGELES EXAMINER
     (from an interview with actress Winifred Kingston)..Miss Kingston threw
some very interesting light on Sands' career, details gleaned, she said, from
various conversations with Taylor.
     "While Edward Knoblock was living at Mr. Taylor's home [during June/July
1921 when Taylor was in Europe], " she said, "Sands went down to a well known
department store in town and bought at various times a considerable amount of
lingerie. I understood he gave these to a girl he was interested in--a very
young creature who lived at home with her mother. All of this he charged to
Mr. Taylor's account, a matter which greatly enraged the director when he
returned from abroad.
     ..."During this same period, when Mr. Knoblock was a guest of Mr.
Taylor's and was supposed to pay for nothing, Sands presented the English
author with a bill amounting to some hundreds of dollars for groceries he had
used while at the house. Mr. Knoblock, being a gentleman and not wanting a
row, however little he understood the matter, paid the bill. When Mr. Taylor
returned he was naturally dumbfounded.
     "On another occasion Sands did another peculiar thing. Mr. Taylor had two
thermos bottles around the house, neither of any particular value. There were
many other things Sands easily could have stolen of more value. But he took
one of these bottles to present to some girl. Her mother did not understand
the act at all and didn't want the girl to take it.
     "Most unusual of Sands' actions, however, was a document he once drew up.
     "One day, to show his affection and regard for Mr. Taylor, he wrote, in
his own handwriting, a sort of servile contract, in which he said that he
would be Mr. Taylor's servant for life and would always be his slave.
     "Mr. Taylor told me about the document and laughed. I don't know what
ever happened to the paper, but Sands apparently took it seriously.
     "All of this led me to believe that the man was mentally deranged and he
is the only man I can think of who might have killed Mr. Taylor."

                                                               NEW YORK HERALD
     (Los Angeles)--...The fact that his houseman, Henry Peavey, and his
former secretary, Edward F. Sands, are both said to be "queer persons," has
led to much speculation whether Taylor was abnormal himself. It is thought by
a majority who are investigating the case that this is a phase which will
develop and throw much new light on the case.

                                                        SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER
     (Los Angeles)--A new and vital witness upon one of the big points in the
William D. Taylor murder mystery was found tonight by an Examiner
representative, who received from him the most important statement yet made as
to Edward F. Sands, whom the police of the nation are seeking.
     This man, a well known citizen living within a block of the Taylor
apartment at 404B South Alvarado Street, saw Sands within a few minutes after
the time the film director was murdered.
     The information furnished by this citizen was turned over to the police
and is regarded as the most definite yet obtained in its bearing upon the
movements of the much sought Sands.
     "I was going home Wednesday night," said the informant, "and was possibly
a block from the Taylor home when I saw Edward Sands across the street. I had
known him some time and recognized him at once under the glare of an electric
light.
     "As he knew me equally well the recognition was mutual. But instead of
crossing over or of speaking as I naturally expected he would do, he turned
his face the other way and hurried on, taking the first turn and disappearing.
     "His actions struck me as peculiar at the time. He appeared to be trying
to conceal himself, did not want to be recognized.
     "My general impression of him at the time was that he was excited and
flustered.
     "The time was just about 8 o'clock. He was coming from the direction of
Taylor's apartment, hurrying along as though to lose no time, a very fast
walk, I would describe it, which might easily have changed into a run...
     "If Sands were arrested, charged with murder and tried I would testify to
these facts if called as a witness."
     After being seen by an Examiner reporter the Hollywood resident made the
same statement to police detectives.

     Several detectives were inclined to the theory that the person who slew
Taylor may have been mentally unbalanced, and qualified their remarks
regarding that phase of the probe by discussing confidential reports obtained
today from the mystery witness who called at detective headquarters and who
was said to have stated he saw Sands near the scene of the slaying late
Wednesday night.

     ...The visit of Mr. Eyton to the Detective Bureau was for the purpose of
aiding in the search for Sands. Several witnesses who know the fugitive say
they saw him in Los Angeles about the time of the shooting. At least two
persons believe they saw him on the night of the shooting. One woman saw Sands
within a block of the Taylor home within less than two hours of the time set
for the murder.
     Capt. Adams in a statement to newspaper men declared that the entire case
hinges on Sands.
     "If we can locate Sands," declared Capt. Adams, "then we will be able
once and for all to settle the question of his whereabouts on the night of the
murder. If Sands cannot prove to our satisfaction where he was on Wednesday
night between 7 and 8 o'clock we will then believe that we have found the
right man."
     ...Several women and three men, all of whom know Sands by sight, say that
they saw him on the streets of the city during the last month.
     ...Police say Sands has lost some weight since he fled after the first
robbery.

William Desmond Taylor, will be issued, it was declared tonight by Detective
Sergeant Edward King, of the police department who is detailed to work in the
district attorney's office. The complaint will be based on "new and
conclusive" evidence uncovered today, according to King.
     "In my mind," said Sergeant King, "the case has been solved."
     "There is no doubt left. I believe that Sands is the man. A murder
complaint will be issued against him.
     "We have uncovered corroborative evidence of such a nature that the
arrest of Sands is absolutely necessary in clearing this mystery."
     ...At the same time Captain Adams declared Sands was the only person
whose arrest the police were seeking in connection with the case.
     "There has been abundant surmise about other individuals," he said, "and
we have run down countless clues relating to the murder. But I can say
positively that we have no leads that would warrant us seeking any one but
Sands."
     The circular reads as follows:
     "We hold warrants on charges of grand larceny, felonies for the arrest of
Edward F. Sands. We also have burglary charges against him and seek him for
the murder of William Desmond Taylor in the city of Los Angeles of February 1,
1922.
     ..."He is about 26 years of age, height five feet seven or eight inches;
heavy build; some months ago weighed 185 to 195 pounds or more, but is said
to be lighter now; present weight may not be more than 175; round full face,
light complexion, very heavy brown hair, rather heavy eyebrows, said by some
to almost meet over his nose; short nose; peculiar mouth which looks small
when closed; smokes cigarettes; usually well dressed; is well educated, fine
penman, good accountant..." [8]

     "The more one talks over this case," said Adams, "the more certain it
seems that Sands is implicated. Sands knew all about the shady side of
Taylor's life; knew his name was Tanner; knew undoubtedly about the wife and
girl back east...
     "It is quite likely Sands killed Taylor, either out of revenge for what
he considered unjust treatment--unrequited affection, if you will--he was of a
peculiarly feminine nature, remember--or in an attempted blackmail which
failed at the last minute."

near the scene of the crime about the time of the shooting, which is

He also has been reported from reliable sources to have been in Los Angeles

     E. W. Wingate, of the Famous Players, who saw William Desmond Taylor just
before leaving Hollywood two weeks ago, expressed disbelief to The N. Y.
American yesterday that a woman had been at the bottom of the Taylor murder
mystery.
     ...Mr. Wingate declared that in his talk with Taylor about the Christmas
greetings he had received from "Alias Jimmy Valentine," it struck him that
there was a peculiar relationship between Edward F. Sands, his secretary-
valet, and Taylor. The tone of the facetious and threatening notes accredited
to Sands gave the impression that he considered it his right to pawn Taylor's
clothes and steal Taylor's money...
     Previous to this robbery and message, Wingate said, it was rumored in
Hollywood that Taylor had received a message from Jimmy Valentine, following
the first robbery, after Taylor's return from Europe, which read:
     "I got these things this time, but next time I get you."

     ...Several of the officers adhere closely to the theory that Sands,
inspired by hate and a desire for revenge upon the man who caused him to be a
fugitive from justice, slipped into the Taylor home and shot down his former
employer...The officers who believe Sands committed the murder hold the
opinion that he is insane, or at least mentally unbalanced because of his
troubles, and believe many of his actions can be accounted for in this way.

     (Los Angeles)--Two hours after William Desmond Taylor was murdered--that
is, about 10 o'clock on the night of February 1--a man was seen loitering in
the vicinity of Taylor's residence, hiding behind a telephone pole.
     Policeman Thomas Long saw him. He saw the policeman. He disappeared.
After the discovery of the murder Policeman Long found near the telephone pole
the gold tips of two smoked cigarettes--cigarettes of the same brand as those
stolen from the house.
     The policeman, who told the story to Capt. David L. Adams last Sunday,
repeated it this evening to District Attorney Woolwine. It was the first time
the story has become public. Considerable importance is attached to the clew.
     A few days after the burglary a cigarette stub was found on the doorstep
of Taylor's home. It was one of the stolen ones.
     It was about 10 o'clock, according to Long, when he saw the man skulking
back of the telephone post. The shot was heard about 8 o'clock and the man
Mrs. Douglas MacLean, wife of the film star, saw, left immediately after the
shot was fired. Is he the man of the cigarette? Is he the man seen by the
policeman? Why was he waiting there?

                          Sands Insane, Friend Thinks
     The belief of detectives that if Edward F. Sands, valet-secretary to
William D. Taylor, killed his employer, he was insane, was bolstered last
night by information tending to show that the missing fugitive was mentally
deranged.
     George S. Brettner, who became well acquainted with Sands before the
latter's disappearance more than a year ago, [sic] told of actions and remarks
of a peculiar nature.
     At that time Sands was talking of joining a foreign navy or going to
South America, according to Mr. Brettner. He said he was becoming restless and
wanted a change, but spoke no ill of Mr. Taylor.
     "I don't know what I'd do if I lost my job and didn't have any money,"
Sands is reported to have said.  "When I get to be 35 years old I'm going to
blow my head off.  I don't see any use of people living after that age.
They're not good for anything. I used to be chief petty officer in the
Quartermaster Corps aboard ships, and I guess I might as well enlist and be
taken care of until I'm ready to shoot myself."
     Sands always carried a .45-caliber Colt revolver, Mr. Brettner said. One
morning Mr. Brettner went to Sands's room and found him asleep.  He touched
him on the shoulder to awaken him.  Sands turned over like a flash and pressed
the weapon against Mr. Brettner, but when he saw who it was he turned over and
went to sleep again without saying a word.
     "Sands was keeping company with a girl who frequented Wilson's Dancing
Academy," said the informant. "He seemed to be infatuated with her. He weighed
about 185 pounds at that time and was trying to reduce to 150 pounds. I used
to find him at Mr. Taylor's home perusing the Encyclopedia Brittanica by the
hour. Sometimes he would refuse to speak to me, and when I'd meet him a few
days later he would apologize and say he had been feeling depressed."
     ...Mr. Brettner said he did not believe Sands killed the director unless
perhaps he was seized with an insane obsession.

     (Los Angeles)--...One of the revolvers belonging to Taylor is a German
Lueger, with shoulder piece.
     Taylor did not bring this back from France, but bought it in New York. A
friend recalls that one day he and Taylor tried in vain to fit the shoulder
piece to the revolver and finally asked Sands, the valet, if he knew anything
about the Lueger. Without a word, Sands took up the two and by one motion
fitted them together. Taylor turned to his friend and said, "Is there anything
Sands does not know?" That was before his break with Sands, due to alleged
forgery of his name to checks and thefts of clothing by his valet.

     "Find Sands!"
     This laconic suggestion of Mrs. J. M. Berger, income tax specialist, is
the solution of the William Desmond Taylor murder mystery.
     "No doubt of it in my mind," said Mrs. Berger, a young business woman,
with a wealth of bronze hair, and brown eyes. "Edward F. Sands is the man,
I am sure."
     Mrs. Berger opened her mail as she talked about the motion picture
director who had called at her office in the H. W. Hellman building just a few
hours before he was slain in his bachelor apartments.
     "He was here in the afternoon to attend some business," she explains.
"I help not only motion picture folks but many prominent business men on their
income tax returns."
     "Had he expressed a fear of Sands?" Mrs. Berger was asked.
     "Yes, he had talked about his former valet-secretary's forging his name,
and about the 'Alias Jimmy Valentine' note that he had received.
     "I did not know Mr. Taylor intimately--only in a business way, but I knew
some of the most intimate details of his business which I have told to the
district attorney in an effort to clear up the mystery.
     .."I do not think there is a woman in the case...I cannot believe a woman
had anything to do with it...
     "I only know that he was a perfect gentleman, and that I hope the police
never rest until they apprehend the assassin who robbed the world of such a
fine man."

     [regarding the night of the murder] Mrs. M. S. Stone, mother-in-law of
A. W. Wachter, of 412-A South Alvarado Street, gave one of the most
interesting recitals that has yet come to the attention of officers. She said:
     "I was walking slowly up Alvarado Street, going to the home of Mr.
Wachter for dinner."
     Mrs. Stone lives at the Duke Apartments on South Carondelet Street, and
frequently goes to the Wachter home for dinner, generally walking north on
Alvarado Street from Westlake Park to the latter home.
     "As I crossed from the west to the east side of Alvarado Street, at
Sixth, I saw a man standing on the corner, apparently waiting for a car. But
he didn't board the car that came along, and as I was rather nervous about
walking up the street in the dusk, I waited momentarily on the corner."
     The man stopped in front of the Hotel Alvarado, according to Mrs. Stone,
and transferred something from his left hip pocket to the right hand pocket of
his coat.
     "Then he started rather aimlessly up the hill, on Alvarado Street," Mrs.
Stone continued.
     "I walked on behind him, and when he reached Maryland Street he turned
north [sic] out of Alvarado."
     Maryland Street is the one that runs directly behind the apartment
occupied by Taylor.
     Mrs. Stone said that when she noticed the man at first she said to
herself that he would have been well dressed except for the fact that his suit
did not appear to fit well at the collar--that it bulged uncertainly in the
rear, and that his collar was not visible.
     "At that time," Mrs. Stone said, speaking of the man's turning into
Maryland Street, "I thought it might have been Taylor's chef."
     She knew Edward F. Sands, Taylor's former valet and chauffeur [sic], as
his chef, having seen him in the court at various times wearing the white cap
common to cooks.

     One of the most startling bits of information turned over to the
investigators was the reported statement of Henry Peavey, Taylor's colored
servant, that he expected to see his employer killed. This statement was made,
it is said, the day following the robbery of Taylor's home by Sands.
     Shortly after the last robbery of the slain director's home Peavey is
said to have told Harold Freeman, a milkman who delivered milk to the Taylor
home, that he expected to find Taylor dead on the morning after the robbery
was committed and would not be surprised if he himself were not later killed.
     ...Another development of importance concerned information about a woman
whom Edward F. Sands, former valet-secretary to Taylor, is alleged to have
visited frequently.
     ...Freeman, who says he met Sands every morning for several months, also
declared that he saw the fugitive ex-servant shortly after Christmas in front
of a downtown theater. Freeman states that he and his wife were standing in
front of the showhouse early in the evening when Sands passed.
     Freeman further declared, it is said, that Sands asserted that he had
"something on Taylor." On several occasions when Freeman remarked how well
Taylor treated his employee, Sands is said to have replied:
     "Well, he has to treat me right, for I certainly have the goods on him."

     During the questioning of Earl Tiffany (former chauffeur of Taylor) by
Thomas Woolwine, Tiffany recalled Sands saying to him one day: "Let's go
upstairs and see who the old man's been sleeping with." (In other words, let's
go look for evidence of someone else having been in Taylor's bedroom.)

     It was revealed yesterday that Detective Sergeant Tom Ziegler, first
officer to arrive at the scene of the crime, found among Taylor's effects
several checks bearing the director's signature and not filled out and one
made to Edward F. Sands for $950.
     This, it is believed, was a forgery. The others were to be used by Sands
during Taylor's absence in Europe for payment of household bills. The $950
check was never cashed. The conclusion is that Sands was trying his hand at
forgery.
     Although the entire country has been circularized for this man, who is
believed by many of the officers to be the murderer, no trace of him has been
found. Reports that he is in Mexico have never been verified.

     (Los Angeles)--New secret information as to the attitude of Edward F.
Sands toward his former master, William Desmond Taylor, murdered movie
director, set in motion Thursday another desperate effort to find him.
     Sands is as mysterious a figure as Taylor was...Out of mystery came Sands
to Taylor as valet, chef, general utility man, friend.
     It seems that Sands must have known Taylor in that other life of his,
took advantage of his knowledge. It is known that he robbed his master on at
least two occasions. When he pawned the jewelry he had taken, he pawned it
under the name of William Cunningham Deane-Tanner.
     The servant masqueraded as his master. The detectives wonder if the
master ever masqueraded as his servant.
     Sands was of a peculiar nature, say those who know him well. He was
effeminate.
     His voice heard over a telephone, was usually mistaken for that of a
girl. He loved to do little things for his master. He once even signed a paper
vowing he would be Taylor's slave for life.
     He resented Taylor's reproof after the first robbery. He felt, it
appears, that he had more or less of a right to help himself to what he
wanted, when ever he wanted.
     He took back his vow of slavery. He began to hate the household duties,
the menial tasks appointed for him. He even boasted of sticking his fingers in
his master's soup before serving it to him.
     He began even to hate his master, who did not fear him and the knowledge
he possessed, the master who even made complaint to the police charging
robbery and forgery. He fled to avoid arrest, but he sent back messages signed
"Alias Jimmy Valentine." He, it is believed, was the one who entered the
Taylor residence on several occasions, once taking some of the director's gold-
tipped cigarettes.
     The detectives have other indications of the devotion that changed to
malice. They say that Sands' bitterness reached its peak when he learned that
Taylor had hired Henry Peavey, a Negro, to replace him and that Peavey was a
wonder at concocting rice pudding, and a marvel with the crochet needles.
     They recall that a man answering Sands' description was seen near the
Taylor residence on the night of the murder, smoking cigarettes, that he ran
when a policeman approached him, and that the cigarette stubs found where the
man had been standing had gold tips--were evidently some of those stolen from
Taylor.
     The detectives point out that Sands having been in the army and in the
navy--he is wanted for desertion and has several dishonorable discharges in
his record--must have been familiar with firearms. The man who shot and killed
Taylor certainly knew how to handle a weapon.
     The bullet entered a vital spot. Death was instantaneous, the doctors
say.
     They believe that Sands is a degenerate, and that possibly he is insane.
He certainly had a motive for murder--revenge, desperation, malice--perhaps
even a more sinister motive.
     It has been charged that Taylor was a member of an unnatural love cult, a
cult comprised entirely of men, and the detectives who have been trying to get
track of Sands say they believe Sands was also a member of the cult. They
declare he bore an odd affection for the man he served, and that he was not
only enraged when he was charged with theft, but outraged--and jealous.

     Captain of Detectives David L. Adams stated Wednesday that the police
hunt for the murder of William Desmond Taylor had again narrowed to a search
for Edward F. Sands, missing secretary-valet of the picture director.
     Sands was seen only a few days before the shooting in the vicinity of the
Taylor bungalow at 404-B South Alvarado Street by a 10-year-old girl, it is
thought. The girl, who knew Sands when he was employed by Taylor, is positive
in her identification.
     The fact that the man, already charged with robbery and forgery by his
employer, risked detection to visit the spot where he formerly worked,
strengthens Captain Adams' conviction that he is responsible for the murder.

Washington, D.C.
 
Dear Sir:
 
     Referring to your letter of Feb. 8th, 1922, your Reference No. N-622-JHT-
WLB, relative to deserter known to your Department as Edward Fitzgerald
Snyder, alias Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore, and believed by us to be here
known as Edward F. Sands, wanted in connection with the murder of William
Desmond Taylor, beg to advise you that we have been unable to get any trace of
him since the Taylor murder was committed, and knowing his penchant for
enlisting in the Navy, we believe it possible, in fact probable, that he has
again enlisted under some other name, and respectfully request that if
consistent with your regulations, your Department notify all Naval Recruiting
Officers to be on the lookout for him, and that your Department Heads be
instructed to have all of their subordinates who file enlistment descriptions
and other data informed of the fact that we are very anxious to locate and
apprehend this man.
     With the aid of the very complete data furnished by your Department in
the communication of Feb. 8th last, we feel that we have fully established the
identity of the man known here as Edward F. Sands, and that he is the man
known to your Department as Edward Fitzgerald Snyder.
     Assuring you of my sincere appreciation of your co-operation and thanking
you for same, I am,
                                     Respectfully
 
                                    /s/ Jas. W. Everington

                                                            LOS ANGELES HERALD
     (Chicago)--From Chicago officials who came into touch with District
Attorney Asa Keyes of Los Angeles the secret of much of the mystery thrown out
by Keyes regarding a solution of the murder of William Desmond Taylor, was
learned today.
     Keyes, despite a number of statements he has given out regarding the
questioning of new persons in the case and the requestioning of others, is
satisfied that the actual shooting of Taylor was done by Edward Sands,
Taylor's secretary and valet, who has been missing since the crime.
     Sands was seen in Los Angeles the day before the crime and the night
after it occurred and police officials throughout this country and several
other countries have been searching for him ever since.
     Keyes' present investigation is principally based on some minor
circumstances indicating that a woman, who is not a motion picture actress,
may have been an accomplice to the crime to the extent of conspiring with
Sands toward its commission.
     Keyes has a thin chain of circumstantial evidence and he admitted to
Chicago officials that it was "very thin" implicating the woman he suspects.
She is said to have made threats against Taylor after listening to a story
told by Sands implicating Taylor and another woman in a romance in which the
use of narcotics played a prominent part.
     Keyes' theory, upon which he has based his recent questioning of some
witnesses and search for several others, is that this woman urged Sands to the
commission of the crime and financed his escape.
     Sands already had a bitter grudge against Taylor and had written him a
letter threatening his life. According to Keyes the woman may have taken
advantage of his hatred of Sands for Taylor to bring about the assassination
of the latter. [9]

     ...Edward Sands, who was Taylor's valet and secretary, has been the
principal suspect ever since the murder. He had disappeared shortly before the
murder and was sought for stealing some of Taylor's belongings. After Taylor
was killed, the search for Sands took on new intensity, but although a score
of suspects were picked up, he was never found.
     Captain Ray Cato, chief of the police homicide squad, said yesterday that
he still believed Sands was the murderer of Taylor.

     ...Herman Cline, now retired, was chief of detectives at the time. He
said:
     "Richards' statement that Asa Keyes blocked the apprehension and
prosecution of Taylor's murderer is ridiculous. The convict who told him this
story was a dope fiend. Everything possible was done to get at the bottom of
the murder and it is my belief to this day that Sands was the murderer."
     Capt. E. Ray Cato, who was one of the investigators, likewise stated that
all the police records point more strongly to Sands as the killer than to any
other person.
     A similar expression was uttered by Captain Dave Adams, formerly in the
detective bureau at the time of the Taylor murder and who is now a municipal
court bailiff.
     "I always believed Sands was the murderer," he said.
     Lucien Wheeler, former chief of detectives for District Attorney Fitts,
revealed that he had spent many months in an attempt to reopen the
investigation.
     "We reconstructed the entire mystery," said he. "Everything led back to
the same man as the suspected slayer, Edward F. Sands."

 *****************************************************************************
 
                               Sands' Sexuality
 
     As with Taylor himself, some rumors characterized Sands as a heterosexual
Lothario, other rumors characterized Sands as homosexual.  If Sands was indeed
the killer, those rumors suggest the possibility that Sands' sexuality may
have been a factor in the murder, or in his reaction toward Faith MacLean.
 
 *****************************************************************************
 
                  Was Sands the Person Seen by Faith MacLean?
 
     Faith MacLean heard the shot that killed Taylor, and then looking out her
front door she saw a man shut Taylor's door and walk away. The man she saw was
almost certainly the killer, and she stated that although she could not see
his face, which was mostly hidden in shadow, she did not think the man was
Sands. Are there any reasons why she may have been mistaken, that perhaps it
was indeed Sands she saw? Yes--two reasons.
     She stated, "It seemed to me he was not so heavy as Sands." [10] Yet the
statements issued by the official investigators indicated that Sands had lost
substantial weight since he worked for Taylor. When Sands worked for Taylor
his weight was nearly 200 lbs.; when he briefly enlisted in the U.S. Coast
Guard in November 1921 his weight was recorded as 160 lbs. A friend of Sands
stated that Sands was trying to reduce his weight to 150 lbs. So at the time
of the Taylor murder Sands could have been 40 or 50 lbs. lighter than the way
Faith MacLean remembered him, and that difference could have been enough to
make her think it was someone else.
     She also stated that when she was looking at the man, he saw her and
smiled. "He smiled at me, I could see the corners of his mouth curl in the
shadow of his cap. I could not see his face distinctly--not well enough, that
is, to distinguish his features." The fact of his smiling is very unusual.
The murder has been committed, but the killer has not yet escaped; he is just
leaving the scene of the crime when a witness sees him--a witness who may be
able to identify him now and/or later.  This should be a very stressful
moment, not a time for smiling naturally.  But if the killer was Sands, it is
not difficult to imagine Sands recognizing Faith MacLean, whom he had not
seen for seven months, and smiling. Was the killer's smile a smile of
personal recognition? A CAST OF KILLERS says that Sands considered himself
God's gift to women, he "jumped on anything in a skirt," and that Faith
MacLean kept away from him for that reason. [11]  Is it possible that the
killer's smile was a remembrance of unfulfilled lust, a revived appreciation
of her beauty?
     The statements of Faith MacLean do not rule out the possibility that
Sands was the person she saw.
 
 *****************************************************************************
                                       
                 Was Robbery an Element of the Murder Motive?
 
     Robbery was supposedly eliminated as a murder motive because there was no
evidence that any of Taylor's property was taken by the killer. Taylor's
diamond ring was still on his finger, and $78 was in his pocket. Yet:
     According to Adela Rogers St. Johns, Mabel Normand told her that Taylor
always kept $5,000 in cash handy. (In 1908, Taylor suddenly felt compelled to
abandon everything, change his name, and start over.)  The money was in case
it became necessary for Taylor to suddenly begin anew again. [12]
     According to Marjorie Berger, during her meeting with Taylor on the
afternoon before he was killed, he displayed a large roll of bills to her--
a roll much larger than the flat $78 which was found on his body. [13]  Taylor
made no bank deposit that afternoon, so what happened to the money?
     It's possible that Taylor was robbed by the killer; that the killer took
only the roll of money because he wanted it to APPEAR that robbery was not the
motive; perhaps the killer thought nobody else knew about the $5,000. How
would the killer have known about the money? The logical answer: Sands would
have known. If robbery was indeed an element of the murder motive, it greatly
increases the probability that Sands was the killer.

                    Strange Phone Calls Received by Taylor

                          Phone Used To Badger Taylor
     Mysterious telephone calls in the dark hours of the night foreshadowed
the murder of William D. Taylor.
     This important information was given last night by Julia Crawford Ivers,
for eight years scenario writer for the slain man and a close associate of
his in the film industry.
     "A few weeks before Christmas Mr. Taylor told us at the studio that he
was considerably annoyed and mystified by telephone calls late at night. He
said he would answer the phone only to find there was no one at the other end
of the wire when he responded," Mrs. Ivers said.
     "These calls kept on coming at regular intervals, always with the same
results. Mr. Taylor said he had not the slightest idea who was calling him or
what the purpose was."
     Harry Fellows, Mr. Taylor's assistant, confirmed the story. Mr. Taylor
told him of these phone calls, he said.
     ...Mrs. Marjorie Berger said that Mr. Taylor had told her often that he
had been getting mysterious phone calls. He talked so funny saying that he
had wished sometimes that he had dropped prosecution [of Sands]. Mrs. Berger
said: "Why don't you get somebody to watch [your home]?" But he said, "Oh,
no."

He would answer the phone and the party who called would hang up.

                          Conclusions Regarding Sands
                                       
     Several times in his life, Sands made very bold moves.
     After serving a year at hard labor and being dishonorably discharged from
the Navy, he promptly turned around and fraudulently reinlisted--even though
discovery could have resulted in another prison term.
     He repeatedly reinlisted in the military, essentially defying them to
catch him; if he had been caught at the time of his 1921 Coast Guard
enlistment he could have been facing four charges of desertion and six charges
of fraudulent enlistment, plus forgery and embezzlement charges from his Army
enlistment.
     After embezzling money from Taylor, and with a Los Angeles warrant for
his arrest outstanding, Sands returned to Taylor's home to steal again. He
returned yet again, smoking a cigarette on Taylor's doorstep.
     It appears that Sands got a defiant pleasure from "returning to the scene
of the crime." He repeatedly reinlisted and deserted, and he returned several
times to Taylor's home. So Sands could certainly have returned yet again.
     Sands pawned Taylor's stolen jewelry using Taylor's true name.  Sands
wrote the sarcastic note to Taylor and appears to have been the person who was
silently harassing Taylor on the telephone.  Police detectives expressed the
opinion that the main purpose of those telephone calls was to determine if
anyone was home; thus the calls were probably made by the same person who
committed the burglary of Taylor's home on December 4.  In modern terminology,
it appears that Sands was "stalking" Taylor and obtained pleasure from
violating Taylor's "space," as evidenced by the note and the dusty footprints
on the bed.
     There has never been a truly solid reason for dismissing Sands as a prime
suspect in Taylor's murder. The most substantial press clipping which
seemingly exonerates Sands is the following:
       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                                                             February 11, 1922
                                                               OAKLAND TRIBUNE
        The Oakland police are today trying to locate E. F. Snyder, a sailor,
   formerly attached to the revenue cutter Bear, who is believed to be Edward
   Sands, former valet for William Taylor, murdered film director.
        According to information received by Captain of Inspectors Richard
   McSorley, the man who was known on the cutter as Snyder answered the
   description of Sands. He joined the crew in Los Angeles on November 21. Ten
   days later, when the vessel arrived in this city, he was discharged. The
   police were told that Snyder was seen in the Oakland municipal woodyard
   within the last ten days. The record at the woodyard shows that he checked
   out there on February 1.
 
       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 
     If Sands was indeed in Oakland on February 1, it would seem to exonerate
him of the Taylor murder. But given the substantial number of inaccurate
press reports, more authoritative confirmation is needed. It's possible that
this report was investigated by the police and discredited. A few weeks after
the Taylor murder, L.A.P.D. Detective Sgt. Herman Cline made a trip to San
Francisco; reportedly he was there to "run down some local clues" on the
Taylor case. [14]  After Cline completed his investigation and returned to Los
Angeles, he reportedly stated that there would now be a new concentration of
police efforts to find Sands. [15]
     In the opinion of the experienced detectives who worked on the case,
Edward Sands and Charlotte Shelby were the two prime suspects  Of these two,
Sands' physical description much more closely matches the description of the
person seen by Faith MacLean, the person she saw leaving Taylor's home moments
after the fatal shot was fired.
     Sands may have indeed been the killer.

                       Wallace Smith: February 14, 1922
 
The following is another of Wallace Smith's sensationalizing dispatches on
the Taylor case.
 
                                                            February 14, 1922

                                                             CHICAGO AMERICAN
     One of filmland's leading actresses, the adored darling of thousands of
movie fans throughout the country, will be placed under arrest within a week
in connection with the murder of William Desmond Taylor, according to a
report which came today from as nearly an official source as can be reached
in this atmosphere of mystery and official secrecy. [16]
     With her will be arrested--and charged directly with the crime,
according to the same report--a man high in the moving picture industry and
one whose name before today was shielded in the tragic puzzle that has
baffled the Los Angeles authorities.
     The arrests, it was declared, would bring the sensation of all
sensations that have come from Hollywood--an expose of vice and corruption
that would bring the films' fantastic world of dreams crashing to solid
earth.
     Back of the story of the actress and the new man of mystery is said to
be a weird narrative of love and an insane jealousy that was known to but few
of the film folks, despite the ready facilities for gossip and scandal.
     The exact manner in which these newest clews were placed in the hands of
the district attorney may not be revealed.  It was declared, however, that a
chance remark made at a secret rendezvous between the actress and the man
under suspicion in a Hollywood modiste's shop started the investigators on
their new track.
     The actress is known as a woman who for a long time conducted an affair
with one of the star producers of moving pictures. [17]  This producer,
however, was not the man named in the latest report. [18] He was wanted,
however, to tell his story of the actress' affairs and especially her
association since she took up the morphine habit and became a leader in
Hollywood's "dope parties."
     News of the prospective arrests was revealed after four new mystery
witnesses had been taken to the office of District Attorney Woolwine.  There
were two men and two women, all known in Hollywood, guarded by detectives.
     For more than two hours they were questioned by the district attorney
and then rushed into automobiles which rolled them swiftly away from the
prosecutor's office.  At the home of one of the women, who is said to have
overheard the remark in the modiste's shop, no one answered the doorbell when
reporters called early today. [19]
     District Attorney Woolwine declined to make public the names of the
quartet he questioned.  Nor would he comment on the progress being made by
his investigation.
     "This is not a time for talk," he declared, "but for work.  Of course I
have been able to build up certain theories and we hope certain information
brought to us will lead us to the slayer.  But we want to get the murderer
first--then we'll talk about it."
     It was reported that one of the next witnesses to be called will be the
veteran producer who was once the sweetheart of the actress named.  This man
since the tragedy has been sheltered in the bungalow of a friend.  From
there, it was stated, he has issued instructions to the actress, with whom,
despite their ostensible estrangement and many difficulties, he is friendly,
instructing her in her conduct.
     It was declared that this producer had positive information concerning
the infatuation of Taylor for one of the beauties of the films.
     Another sensation and another actress were drawn into the kaleidoscope
of thrills when more letters were found--these from a pretty motion picture
blonde whose chief stock in trade is her portrayals of innocence and her
alleged likeness to one of the favorite actresses in the world. [20]
     These letters revealed that the young woman, looked upon as a mere child
always supposed to be under the chaperonage of her mother, has carried on an
impassioned affair with the eccentric director.  In such fervent tones were
these letters written that the young star's manager had made frantic efforts
to insure their recovery or destruction.
     With the new developments in the heart of Hollywood itself the federal
secret service men did not lag on the trail of the eastern gang of
blackmailers and dope peddlers believed to have slain Taylor when he tried to
protect one of his many women friends.
     The woman supposed to have been a victim of the ring today was reported
in a complete state of collapse, unable even to communicate with her
servants.  Private detectives guarded her home.  The federal agents may
search the underworld of Chicago and New York, but there still lingers a fear
that Taylor's assassin has remained in Los Angeles to complete his fatal
errand with the death of the actress.
     There was considerable interest shown, too, in the further examination
of Taylor's private papers.  Actresses and others received various generous
sums for no reason explicable by Taylor's check stubs or memoranda. One of
those who received regular payments from Taylor--payments of $200 a week over
a protracted period--was a writer well known in Los Angeles as a man who
controlled sources of publicity which could be either very valuable or very
ruinous to a man in Taylor's position.
     Other sums were paid to actresses whose names were never even hinted in
connection with the name of Taylor.
     These were given added importance because of the discovery of fresh
letters, reported in these columns yesterday, which showed that Taylor had
had dealings with gangsters of the bootlegging and dope rings.
     Public Administrator Bryson, engaged in going over Taylor's effects, was
indignant at what he found.
     "Why, they were bleeding him white!" he exclaimed.  "Don't you ever
forget that Taylor was being robbed by some blackmailers.  One of the best
theories I have heard to account for his death is that he was killed by one
of these human vultures."
     The campaign of propaganda to backfire against the conflagration of
criticism which has blazed up against Hollywood's wilder set was given new
impetus by the entrance of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce into the
campaign to "tell the truth about Hollywood."
     This policy, strictly adhered to, promised very interesting
developments, according to those familiar with the situation.
     Do not think for a moment that the wilder set is trying to be less wild,
except just for a little while.  They have been used to "running things" and
they are in no mood to quit.  They're sorry for Bill Taylor, and all that.
But life must go on and all that sort of thing.
     So much so, that one of the largest hotels in Los Angeles has
practically taken the law into its own hands to curb the outbursts of the
screen idols.
     Not so very many weeks ago a group of these riotous merrymakers, loaded
with "dope" and booze, began to beat up hotel detectives and uniformed police
who sought to quiet them.  There was quite a ruckus.
     The hotel chief of detectives today issued the following orders to his
staff:
     "Don't argue with them any more.  If one of them so much as pours a
drink on top of the table or sniffs a nail full of cocaine in this hotel, hit
him over the head with your blackjack and drag him out."
     It was learned, too, that but recently the police failed to raid a party
that was a disgrace even in Hollywood, although they were informed of the
affair in advance.  The "party" was given by a titled nobleman and there were
some sixty or seventy guests.  Several of these were men dressed in women's
clothes.  Various minor depravities--minor, that is, in the set--occupied the
evening until the piece de resistance was brought in.  This was a spectacular
entrance.  At a signal all the lights in the big studio went out.  A
spotlight suddenly threw its glare on a wide staircase at the far end of the
hall.
     Down the stairs minced six men dressed only in underwear.  They chanted
a funeral dirge in high-pitched voices as they entered.  On their shoulders
they carried a coffin, which was auctioned off to the highest bidder.
     The bidding over, the casket was opened.  Its contents may be better
imagined than described.  Or maybe not.  At any rate, they cannot be
described in dispatches destined for a newspaper. [21]

NOTES:
[1] The absurd rumor that Edward Sands and Denis Deane-Tanner were the same
person has been thoroughly disproven elsewhere. See WDT: DOSSIER, pp. 370,
391-392. In MABEL, Betty Fussell suggests the possibility that Edward Sands
was in jail for tire theft at the time of the murder, but that was a
different Edward Sands, as was verified by the investigators at the time. See
LOS ANGELES RECORD (February 3, 1922).
[2] The "alias Jimmy V." letter, a comparison of Snyder/Strathmore/Sands'
handwriting, and photos of Snyder taken during his military career can
temporarily be found on the Gopher server at pi.la.asu.edu, in the
subdirectory: Internet Sampler/Selected Electronic Newsletters/Taylorology/
Graphic Image Files for Taylorology.
[3] We can read between the lines and speculate further about the
circumstances of Snyder's first desertion. He probably only "borrowed" the
car (without the owner's permission), intending to return it unnoticed. But
when the car was wrecked, there was no way to hide what he had done. He
probably pleaded with his commander: "I'm really sorry--I know I shouldn't
have borrowed the car without asking. But I've had an excellent service
record up to this point and am hoping to make the Navy my career. Please
don't court-martial me. Give me a second chance." His commander then probably
agreed, but only on the condition that Snyder fully pay for the automobile
repairs. To which, Snyder perhaps replied, "I don't have that much money
here, but I can get it if you will let me make a quick trip to New York--I'll
come right back with the money." Snyder left, but the promise to get the
money was a bluff--he didn't have it.  (In 1922, one of Sands' acquaintences
stated he was always broke.) Facing another probable prison term, Snyder
probably felt he had no choice but to desert and start over again.
[4] Snyder surely felt he was forced to desert at this time. If the Navy had
discovered that Strathmore was really Snyder, it would be just a matter of
time before they realized that Snyder was currently wanted as a deserter from
the Naval Reserve. Better get out while the gettin's good. Officially, his
date of desertion was April 2, 1919.
[5] See NEW YORK HERALD (February 9, 1922).
[6] But since there was almost no profit from the December 4 burglary--the
stolen jewelry was pawned by Sands for only $30--it seems very unlikely that
an associate of Sands committed the burglary on Sands' behalf. The dusty
footprints on the bed also seem to indicate that the burglar was Sands
himself.
[7] The rumor that Sands' body was found in Connecticut has been discredited.
See WDT: DOSSIER, p. 396 and HARTFORD COURANT (March 17, 1926).
[8] Concerning Sands' physical description, A CAST OF KILLERS states that
Sands was "ugly as a boot." On the contrary, his associates in the Navy
described him as "handsome after a fashion" (see HARTFORD COURANT,
February 10, 1922) and the photos of Sands taken during his Navy years
confirm this description.
[9] The unnamed woman is obviously supposed to be Charlotte Shelby. Since
Shelby and Sands were the two most popular suspects, it is only natural that
a theory would arise which would involve them as co-conspirators.

[16] From the material which follows, Smith is clearly referring once again to
Mabel Normand.
[17] Mack Sennett.
[18] The identity of the "new man of mystery" is unknown, but an educated
guess would be Paul Bern: (a) At the time he held a major executive position
at Goldwyn and thus was "a man high in the moving picture industry."
(b) Mabel Normand had been making plans to attend the annual ball of the
American Society of Cinematographers, held on February 4, 1922 (see WDT:
DOSSIER, p. 268). Bern did attend that ball (Mabel did not, of course), and
he may have originally been her date. (c) Bern did escort Mabel to other
Hollywood social events.
[19] Reportedly, the two women questioned were "Lady Jane" Lewis, who managed
the modiste's shop, and Miss S. O. Lewis. See CHICAGO TRIBUNE (February 14,
1922).
[20] Mary Miles Minter.
[21] Other reports of this incident stated that the coffin contained a
"beautiful naked boy." See NEW YORK EVENING WORLD (February 13, 1922).
