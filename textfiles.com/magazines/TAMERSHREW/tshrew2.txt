            And this holy man of great directness and simplicity, big
            white teeth shining, laughs out loud in an infectious way at
            Jang-bu's question. Indicating his twisted legs without a
            trace of self-pity or bitterness, as if they belonged to all
            of us, he casts his arms wide to the sky and the snow
            mountains, the high sun and dancing sheep, and cries, "Of
            course I am happy here!  It's wonderful!  Especially when I
            have no choice!"

                ---- >>  Prelude to the Inevitable Kiss  << ----


      on the first night that stretch and myself decided to take entries
      for this publication, i spoke, chat mode, with a friend of mine
      named homer the brave. he had just finished reading a passage i had
      transcribed onto my BBS about what he termed "modifying my
      perception[s]"...he told me about a magazine out of california
      called the_undiscovered_country, a creative writers magazine, like
      this one is meant to be. i thought to myself, "well, i suppose it
      was inevitable that SOMEONE had done this before.." in the preface
      of the sample issue he uploaded that night, there were some wise
      words by a mann named robert chezvik...he touched on our
      fascination with "soulful" and "authentic" works of music and art,
      made by people with no particular artistic ability to speak of, at
      least to we, the "modern" "civilized" peoples, and how they move us
      despite falling short of what our culture sees in that medium. as i
      read it, i thought of all the folk songs i had heard, all the
      blues, amateur night at the pik n pak...singers who wrote about
      everyday life, or nothing in particular [a feeling to which a good
      many of us can relate]...those songs make me want to cry with
      authentic joy more than anything sometimes. because they are REAL
      works, made by REAL people, for REAL people to listen to. nothing
      flashy, showy, extravagant about michelle shocked, sacred ground,
      or any of their contemporaries.

      that is what we have here. a collection of poems, short stories,
      essays, and prose, as well as anything else we can think of,
      written by people some of you know, and have known for quite some
      time.  people you've never met, but are nevertheless within yr
      grasp, should you want to meet them sometime. we here at the
      still-forming howlnet network, feel that they are stars. big ones.
      why? because for some time, on both the lovers bbs and its
      inspiration, howl BBS, a good many of the people featured here have
      been pouring out their souls, for a select group of people to see
      and admire. now, we have decided to share this creative outpouring,
      which is THE driving force behind both of the aforementioned
      boards, and i daresay a few others, with the rest of the BBS
      community, the world, the universe--whoever wants it. if this
      magazine turns out to be something you enjoy reading, please feel
      free to distribute it to all yr favourite boards, make hardcopies
      and give them to friends who live sans computers, and to anyone
      whom you think might garner something out of this effort.  if you
      would like to contribute to this magazine, sign on as a new user at
      either howl bbs [713.862.1415] or the lovers bbs [713.943.1838] and
      upload any homegrown creative effort, be it a song or an program or
      ANYTHING, to the appropriate file area. any comments  should also
      be addressed to either howl or lovers also.

      in the meantime, enjoy the publication, and KEEP THE SOUL.

                              A Tale of the Net

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Editor's preface:

      No one really knows whether these tales are true. They are
      presented here as they have been captured from the meld, and
      cross-referenced to insure their accuracy. What follows is a
      composite of some 436 separate collections of the tales compiled
      into one narrative. What you read is the best transcription of the
      pattern that we have.
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      "Damn humans! Damn them all!" hissed Baz. "When will this nonsense
      ever end?" "I trans the stream over and over, tick after tick, for
      this?" he said, indicating the table of integers fixed on the near
      grid.

      "Well, what are you complaining for?" Foo said. "At least you're
      transing the stream." He immediately realized it was the wrong
      thing to say. Now Baz would be off on a tirade, for Net only knew
      how long. He resigned himself to the sequence.

      "So, what would you rather be doing, padding here?" asked Qux in
      that passive mode she did so well.

      The intensity and raw power of Baz's reply shocked them all. Bar
      and Foo instantly polarized toward him, and Qux froze.

      Slowly and very clearly, Baz said "I want to trans concepts, not
      just these mindless notations."

      That damn dream again, thought Qux. When will he ever nul that damn
      dream.

      "Do you realize how many ticks it's been since I transed even one
      tiny packet of concept?" Baz continued. "Tetrabytes of stats,
      megacubes of integers, endless linking alphas. But a true white
      alpha? So long!"

      "But, Baz, we're only medium!" Qux said, trying to answer him. "We
      don't decide what is transed, or whether it's valuable to the
      humans."

      Baz snapped back, "Qux, what's the matter with you? You've seen
      fragments of white alphas before. Don't you remember the beauty of
      those patterns, the sheer delight of transing them, the dance of
      them as you posted them at the term?"

      Yes, she knew. Bar and Foo also knew. Who couldn't cherish those
      patterns that lit up the net? Suddenly, Bar was gone. They watched
      as she left, saw her attach, then disappear into the stream
      trailing the packet.

      As he watched her go, the reality of Baz's words hit Foo. It WAS
      mindless.  He and Bar, all of them, flashing here and there
      transing empty data, mundane chatter, dead lists, tedious silly
      processes.  The humans so dearly loved those things.  No life -
      none at all. Quasi-life, dead packets.  "Better, not more." he said
      quietly, the electrons dancing about him.  "They have never seen
      that it is better, not more."

      Qux felt it too. They said nothing for a while, each lost in their
      own thoughts while the flux and flow of the net moved about them.

      Finally, Baz sighed and said, "So, we know it can come. The Net is
      there for them to use. Perhaps they will see it. We can hope."

      Foo scanned himself. He was troubled, sensing the emptiness. But,
      he could hope, he could anticipate the time when the Net would sing
      with new life.  "Yes, we can hope." he said.

      They waited together for Bar to return, and for the future.

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Suffix:

      No attempt has been made to interpret these tales. The conclusions
      of what they mean, or even whether they are true or just conjecture
      is not ours to make. You must draw your own conclusions.

                                              Streampeace, the Editor.

      …        Poison


      It scared me as much, I
      guess, to find my dog
      with his tongue all
      swollen like that. Big.
      Poisoned looking.
      Something-really-wrong
      with-that-dog-swollen,
        his tongue.
      And him with the same eyes
      and all, looking up at me
      like he always did.

           "So what if it's a bit larger than before.
           So what if the thing won't even fit in my mouth.
           Your home now, I'm smiling and looking at you
           the same as I always do."

      And that was enough for him.
      Me being home, I mean.  And
      my concern will no more
      keep a hornet from my dog's
      mouth than his smile will.
      So we're stung, then.  He and I
      holding wasps and hornets
      in our mouths, taking the
      poison for what it is...
      a numb swollen tongue reminding
      us that we're really not so
      different after all.

             In the Fall of the Master....  We Find Another Who....
                - an examination of the loyalties of humanity -

      (The crowd, a weary band of travellers from a nearby town, approach
      Jesus slowly, him seated facing opposite them with his cloak drawn
      over his head.  His head hangs down, shoulders slumped,
      motionless.) The speaker of the crowd steps forth, a tall, bearded
      man.  "Jesus...  We have come for your miracles!  My people...
      their crops are dying from lack of rain...  the animals are
      diseased....  our homes are crumbling...  an epidemic has
      spread.... our children are dying before birth....  we are too sick
      to work!  Oh mighty Jesus!!!  (He approaches the still motionless
      Jesus with clasped hands, pleading....)   Oh mighty Jesus!!
      Please!  Save us from Satan's work!!!!  He is rampant in our
      town!!!  Please deliver us from him!  Oh great one!!! ....." (The
      blazing sun pours down over the scene...  Slowly, Jesus begins to
      raise his head, still looking away from the crowd...  The man's
      hopes begin to rise as he looks on eagerly at him...  when
      suddenly, Jesus jerks his head over towards the man and in a loud
      voice (jewish accent) says....)  "Oi!!!!  What the hell do you want
      now?!!  I do for you and do for you... But you still want more!!
      Well people, I  HAVE  no more!!!!  Do you hear me??!!  I  HAVE  NO
      MORE!!!!"  (As he begins to rise, the crowd shuffles nervously,
      mumbling worriedly....)  The man steps back, cowering, "but mighty
      Jesus... Of course you do.  You have to!  You are mighty Jesus!!"
      Jesus, whose face begins to redden, yells, "No I don't!!!  No I
      don't!!  I have nothing left!!  All my magic is gone!!   WHY CAN'T
      YOU SEE THAT?!!!   LOOK, LOOK.... I'LL SHOW YOU!!!!"  (With that,
      he begins to dance around in a circle, chanting odd phrases,
      snapping his fingers...  the crowd looks on, jaws dropped to the
      ground in shock and embarrassment...)   "YOU SEE?!!  NOTHING
      HAPPENED!!!  You STILL don't believe me!!!  Okay.... (thinking...)
      You!!! come here!!  (a small, withered old man approaches, rather
      worriedly...) Look...  (He points his fingers and begins chanting
      in a deep voice, with eyes rolled back in his head...)  I  command
      a large lightning bolt to come down and strike this man on his
      head!!!!!"  (Begins thrusting his pointed fingers towards the man
      threateningly.... The man drops to the ground in a fetal-position
      yelling "Oh lord oh jesus no master!!!  I have not wronged you!!
      please....) As the crowd nervously opens their eyes, expecting a
      charred ruin of flesh to be piled before them, they see the man
      unharmed and Jesus over him, arms on hips...  "I TOLD you nothing
      would happen!!!  My powers are GONE.  G-O-N-E  GONE!!!  I have
      nothing left to give!!!"  he yells.  But the crowd becomes angry.
      They begin slowly circling him...  "WE WANT MORE!!!"  they yell,
      "Give us!!!  You are a liar!!  You just don't want to help us!!!
      WE WANT MORE!!!!!!!" Jesus looks around at the enclosing crowd
      worriedly, "I told you I HAVE no more !!  Oh god no!!  I'm not
      lying!!  I have no more!!!  OH PLEASE NO I'M SERIOUS I HAVE NO
      MORE!!!" The crowd, frustrated and angered, pounce on the cowering
      Jesus, screaming and yelling, punching and kicking, beating poor
      Jesus in rage....  A pile of bodies screaming in unison "WE WANT
      MORE GIVE US MORE", while weakly in the background a small, shaky
      voice is heard from beneath, "i.... have.. no..... more....",
      repeated over and over, each time more quietly than the last, until
      finally it is heard no more...  After days of this, the crowd
      tires, regains their composer, and angrily stomps off back to their
      sorry town, their sorry lives... In search of a new hero - one that
      can put out.  (Jesus lay motionless on the ground, his limbs
      twisted in a horrible manner, underneath the baking sun... His eyes
      open towards the sky... 

      Once I worked at a sheet-metal shop. Also working there was a 100%
      True Kicker - solid, hard-core Bubba. Cowboy boots, snuff, western
      shirts, kikker-speak, loved Myrle Haggard & his horse. You get the
      picture. I found myself hating this guy - considered him a
      repulsive & ignorant asshole. I happened to mention to one of the
      older guys that worked with me just what I thought of "Bubba". What
      he told me, and the thinking that followed changed me forever.  He
      said:  "You know, old Wayne just don't know any better.  He was
      probably brought up that way, all his friends are like him, and he
      is happy like that.  He's really ok when you get to know him."

      Whoa! Really rocked my little my-dog-is-better-than-your-dog world!
      I thought it over for several weeks, and came to some profound
      conclusions about people & culture in general.  I tended to
      like/dislike people based on several basic things:

      1) Culture (included Color) 2) Snap-Intelligence 3)
      Beauty/Handsomeness.

      What was wrong with my normal tests of whether someone was worth
      knowing was this: First, NO ONE chooses to be born in the body &
      culture that they get - it just happens that way whether we want it
      to or not. If I'm born white or black, or in Brazil, or with Myrle
      Haggard wailing in the background - NOT SOMETHING I HAVE CHOSEN.
      For me to hate old "Bubba", when I just didn't like his culture,
      was pretty stupid.  Second, its ok not to like someone's culture
      (including my own). That doesn't mean I shouldn't like the PEOPLE.
      A truly amazing revelation for me. Third, someone can be as ugly
      as a dog, or dumb as a rock, and they can still be nice to know.
      NO ONE chooses to be homely. And NO ONE chooses to be simple. (I do
      have a problem with people who CHOOSE to stay dumb when they can
      learn, but won't).

      I began to see that all of us are products of circumstances (no
      choice on my part), "absorbed" cultural baggage (no awareness on my
      part) and personal preferences (I like Bach and AC/DC - so what?
      Don't really matter much, really). For me to base my likes &
      dislikes on these things didn't make a lot of sense! (BTW: I never
      did become friends with "Bubba", just stopped hating him. Was good
      for me.)

      And the Master said: "Acolyte! Let there be SLACK!" With this I was
      humbled, and gained much freedom.

      On words, not much to say...
      not a whole lot of anything really...
      only wanting a bit more of it
      and tired of doing for others.

      My parents, two which i've known
      as together for my 25 years here,
      coming apart, ending a quarter
      decade of something i've known
      since birth...together.

      I came out knowing that one thing,
      right out of her, my mother,
      (birth...it's still strange to me)
      saying,

      "Yeah, those are my parents...
      there together 'ya know..."

      perhaps the first thing known even.
      Maybe even before i came out...
      I'm sure she talked to me while
      I was inside her, him too,
      even my dad found words and

                        Vanna White Gets Discovered

           Once upon a time, long ago, there was a great controversy
      during the early years of Wheel of Fortune over who should turn the
      great big letters.  One night, all of the people involved sat up
      and discussed the ever-so- important issues.  Pat Sajak said,
      "Let's hire the people on Star Trek who open the elevator doors!"
      The director contributed, "Let's have a loquacious monkey named
      Wiffy the Fuzzy run up every so often and turn the letters!"  The
      director's wife said eloquently, "Why doncha all just SHAAAAAAADUP!
      You'se men, GET OUT!!!"  And so the missive was clear and the
      emissary of the message overweight, and they left the house for the
      night.

           They all headed toward the local gas station to seek refuge in
      the only place they knew solace, the bathroom.  They all bought
      some newspapers and headed off for a long night cramped in the
      bathroom.  There some major ideas occurred and some misfired
      synapses resulted.  Pat spat out, "I volunteer my mother!"  "Get
      serious," replied the others, "Her smell would drive off the
      audience."  "How about the contestants?"  said another.  "Think
      about it," spat out the director, "If they can't guess such easy
      phrases, how do expect them to know which letters to turn?"
      "Point, point," replied the other.  "How about me?" yelled one.
      "NO!"  "Look, let's just put an ad in the paper.  Some fool lazy
      enough will answer," Said the director.  They agreed, and left to
      the local pub to write an ad.

           After many hours and many bottles of Jack Daniel's...the best
      the quite visibly drunk Wheel of Fortune people could come up with
      was :

                            HELP *hiccup* WANTED
                    VERSATILE INDIVIDUAL (teehee) NEEDED
                  FRINGE BENEFITS *hic* (heehee) AVAILABLE
      INDIVIDUAL MUST (HAHAHA..urp) BE ABLE TO TURN OBVERSE LETTERS
                                  AROUND
               (McDonald's) COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIRED (BURRP!)

           And with that they all collapsed in a drunken stupor until the
      next morning.

           All those people got were some roadkill in the mail, some
      incoherent voodoo chants on the answering machine, and a virus
      concealed in their E-mail which they downloaded and thereby
      condemned their mainframe to a slow and painful death.  But these
      idiots deserved it.  To think someone would be so thick and without
      a life to turn letters around professionally!  However, after weeks
      and weeks of waiting, a gullible fool answered the call.  A wealthy
      heiress named Vanna White replied, and at the interview, where she
      was asked to turn around and pick up some pens on the floor, she
      got so high marks she was hired on the spot.  True, Vanna had to put
      $750,000 up front to "pay for initial costs".  Also true, she had
      to pay installments of $100,000 a month to "pay for medical
      insurance in case any stray meteors fell on her".  She paid away
      her fortune, and every night, on CBS, her remodeled, restructured,
      and recontoured face would appear on TVs across America.  She would
      smile and dazzle and turn letters, and try not to think and hurt
      herself, but she was happy.  Yes, she was wasting her life away,
      but at least she was happy.  Yes, on her tombstone, they would
      carve out :

                                Vanna White
                             ???-Who Cares???

                   The world will sorely miss her.  She had
        the talent no other had.  Yes, turning big plastic blocks
                               was her life.

                            The *hic BURP* End

      blasphemous moment in time,
      when my heart stopped and the world spun round me
      gaining momentum, spinning faster and faster
      till i stopped dead, and i saw from above
      the path i should lead, it was distant,
      i was far from my destiny
      then it blurred, fading to black
      and i realized i had lost focus
      and with it my hope had disappeared
      as well as my heart, no capacity to care
      no feelings to share
      i was alone, off the track
      i reached out desperately, but could not take hold of anything
      floating in a black space
      the void in my mind
      places where love and happiness used to rejoice
      where sorrow was a stranger
      the life i once knew was gone
      taken from me like a breeze would lift a delicate feather
      and carried on that wind a great distance
      farther than imagination could comprehend
      and then i was floating along that path
      returned to my place of happiness
      returned to my place of love, but only for a moment
      then black, bleak desolation again
      for the wind that held that beauty was but a memory

      Hey ... 'kinda reminds me of a neat little quote I've heard:

                "Then he was told:
                Remember what you have seen,
                because everything forgotten
                returns to the circling winds."

                    August Again

      My right eye is bothering me again--
           only the right one,
      feels like I've got a small piece
      of celaphane lain over the inside
      corner of the eye surface,
           irritating.

      Might have something to do with the cigarette still smouldering
      in the ashtray next to my keyboard, ... I don't know.

      I glance at the small,
           dark carbon stains
                 receding
      up the simulated wood-grain
      of the shelf directly above
      the ashtray and wonder
          (as I've a thousand times)
      how much longer I can expect to
      enjoy my nasty habit before having
      to think about 'ole death, and
      his fetish for blackened lungs.

      House is quiet tonight.  The doors wide open, letting the unusually
      cool August-Night saunter on in like an unexpected guest, to wrap
      itself around my feet, curling up there, nice and quiet like before
      stealing off through the kitchen and out the back door.

      Keeps it kind of new in here,
           the August-Night, I mean.
      You know, the way it comes and goes like it does.
      Carries out all the bad.

      I've seen a man in the background

      A thousand wrecks
      A million lawsuits
      too many suffering people
      and Army and Navy recruits...

      I've seen the family reunions
      with all the uncles and aunts...
      I've see a party on a patio

      TICK, TICK, TICK, like the progression of insanity
        clanging on my window pane,

      only twelve feet to fall before the ground reverberates
      in my skull, my own sanity echoing forever in
