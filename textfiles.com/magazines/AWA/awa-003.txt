    Welcome to the third release of AWA.  We got a huge responce since
the last issue, and this installment rocks!  We know you're out there!
Join us!  There is power in numbers!  Help us lift the warez burden
out of cyberspace, and more imortantly off irc!

    We were going to insert an unencoded gif (bones.gif: How 2 B an
Elite WareZ d00d) into this release but since it was so large, it was
decided that it would be left out of the zine.  The gif can still be
aquired from our FTP site.  More on the FTP site later.

*** Membership List


    We actually have a membership list.  We will update it every
issue.  You can be a member if you write something at least once a
month.  You will be placed on the membership list as soon as we
publish one of your articles.  Members will lose their AWA membership
if they do not submit anything to AWA in the timespan of one month.
Its not too much to ask.  The membership list is transient.  There are
only a few permanent members of AWA.  As long as you write you are a
member.  Oh, and if you are a permanent member, you'll know.

*** Distribution of AWA

    If you run a board and want to become an AWA distribution site so
that AWA couriers will give you the zero day AWA releases, you suck.
You suck because distribution sites suck.  If on the other hand you
want to get the latest AWA releases and make them available for
download on your board, we would be more than greatful.  What would
you get in return?  Well your system's name and phone number would be
displayed at the beginning of each AWA release.  To top it all off,
you would get that warm feeling inside you only get when you are
distributing for AWA.  We won't check up on your board, but if we
catch you fibbing, and you don't have the latest issues, we will
destroy your kitchen counter.  The AWA boards are as follows:

System                      Phone Number
ThoughtCrime                +1-617-599-7154

Its just the begining you know.

*** FTP Site

    If you cannot access ThoughtCrime because my modem randomly
decides not to let people to connect there is hope!  You can get the
latest AWA propoganda and release via anonymous FTP.

                             "Warez War Three"

                                Ozone Pilot

        
        The Child himself sat back and looked up at the strategy map.  He
sighed, weighing the possibility of defeat.  The Army Of Fedz was moving
in fast from the west, and his 3l33+ Guard was having difficulty just
containing the eastern quadrents of Warezdom.  The Child picked up the red
phone on his desk and dialed up his advisor.  "We are losing ground.  The
fedz are making a push from the west" he muttered. A low voice came back 
over the phone "We have a new threat now, the lamerz are coming in from the
south, in large numbers.  They are well armed." The Child looked back up at
the map.  "Well" he said, "The LD boards are still up and we have couriers
bringing in the latest warez we will never use, so we arent in too much
trouble yet."  The voice responded "yeah, but we are in Critical Condition,
this is a real Timebomb".  The Child simply hung up the phone, he didnt
like to hear the painful truth.  
        Out on the front, the 3l33+ Guard was falling to the Army Of Fedz.
The k0dez kidz were only armed with VMB's, which were hardly a match for
the Fedz.  The more sophisticated Couriers had Dual Standard 16.8 Jigawatt
phasers, but those hardly had an effect either.  They were falling like
flies, and the Fedz were pushing closer to the Warez House itself, posing
a direct threat for The Child.  The Fedz were gaining ground fast, and
now the lamerz were coming in from the south.  The lamerz scared The Child
most.  They werent elite.  They didnt have the latest warez.  They all
were out to get him.  His empire was in Critical Condition.  
        The Child decided to move down to the basement shelter of the Warez
House.  The thunderous explosions of the SPA 18" shells were getting closer.
The sky darkened and filled with smoke.  He retreated to a small makeshift  
office in the shelter, and opened the desk drawer.  It had been years since
he used the desk.  He found a few old pencils and some scraps of paper with
long since abused k0dez scribbled on them.  He sighed and flipped the switch
on his ancient 486/66DX2 - he hadnt used the old 486 in probably 10 years,  
or whenever the last time he was in the shelter.  He could hardly stand using
such un-warez equipment.  He longed for 986/758MHz.  He longed for the
6989 Gig IDE II hard drive.  He had to settle for 1.2 gigs on this old
machine.  He dusted off the 28.8k modem on the desk and dialed up 
Knee Cap Walkway.  Scanning the message bases, he noticed that every message
he wrote brought 14 negative replies.  The tables had turned.  It was nothing
like the days of TGW, when he contolled what everyone thought and spoke.
No one used autosigs anymore, except him.  The last relic of the ANSI
kingdom, which fell long ago to the Good Guys.  The Good Guys, the people
The Child feared more than the fedz and the lamerz together.  The Good Guys.
The words brought shivvers down his spine.  The Good Guys were a group of
people, who from the very beginning, opposed his couriering empire.  They
tormented him on the boards, they made his life miserable, they destroyed
his reputation, and they won people over to their side.  They made The Child
swallow ever word he spoke, they grilled him thoroughly, they made him
swim in his own stupidity.  He lost a war he though he would win.  Now, he
was fighting another war.  The war that would decide his fate.
        He logged off, near tears.  He called up his mother, and told her
that he was in trouble, and he needed help.  She was tending to the 
warez pie in the kitchen, so she put The Childs father on the phone.  
What was it he needed?  What kind of trouble was he in?  The Child told him
that he couldnt explain the whole thing.  Do you need another $10,000 for
computer equipment?  I can send you the mon..."NO!, I dont need anymore
computer equipment.  You already bought it all for me.  It's what I've done
with it.  I have become a cyberdictator, and now I am being hunted" The Child
told his old man.  His father was puzzled.  "So you dont need mone..."
The phone went dead.  The USSS had cut out the phone service downtown.  They
were getting closer.  The lights flickered.  It was just a matter of minutes
before the power went out.  The Child hit the button on the dusty old
intercom and paged his Vice-CyberDictator.  "Yes sir?" the voice piped over
the box.  The Child spoke: "We are nearing the end.  I want to go to 
Code Yellow." "Are you serious?  You mean..." "Yes, yes, format the hard
drives.  Start now, we have 990,234,678 JigaGigs to erase.  Get a move on,
I want all the warez deleted before they get here."  The Child let go of
the button and confirmed his V-CD's reply.  "Yes sir, I will start formatting
now."  
        Downtown, on E-Street, the Lamerz had crossed the bridge to the
city.  They had made it to 3l33+ territory.  The Lamerz were carrying their
registered software with them, and at least 1000 TerraGigs of shareware.
A warez d00de's worst nightmare.  They had relatively few casualties among 
them, it seems the 3l33+ Guard was too busy keeping the Fedz at bay up north.
They walked up Florida Avenue, where they were greeted by the cheers of
thousands of liberated warez captives.  They no longer had to live in the
fear of having an old ware in their possession.  They didnt have to worry
about the periodic household searches for low speed modems by the 3l33+
Guard.  Women rushed into the streets and embraced the weary soldiers and
offered food and drink.  The Commander of the lamerz allowed the troops to
stop and enjoy the hospitality of the freed souls.  
        Up north, the 3l33+ Guard was fighting a losing war to the
Fedz.  The 3rd Infantry Division of the FBI's Warez Task f0rce was landing
tanks from the sea.  The artillery fire was getting heavier, and now the
planes were starting to arrive.  The 3l33+ Guard didnt have a fighter
squadren anymore, it was totally wiped out in the Great ANSI War.  The
3l33+'s were getting slaughtered.  The Fedz made one final push and broke
the front lines of The Childs defenses.  They made a rush towards the
city, mowing down the helpless 3l33+ guard.  The end was drawing near.
        Down in the basement shelter, The Child stood peering at a radarscope
of the city.  The mad rush of Fedz from the west, the lamerz still resting
down on Florida Avenue, waiting to attack.  "Nooooooooooooo!!!" he suddenly
burst out, shoving his fist through the CRT in a fit of adreniline.  "This
cant happen!".  He turned to his advisor, and looking him straight in the
eyes said "This is your fault!  You didnt ready the Guard fast enough.  You
didnt get the right equipment!  YOUR NOT ELITE ANYMORE!!!!!!".  The Child
grabbed a rifle from the rack on the wall, and the men in the basement all
retreated slowly into corners.  He raised the rifle with his bloodied hands
and pressed the barrel against the advisors head.  "You are responsible
for this..." The gun went off, and the advisors head exploded into large 
peices around the room.  His body fell to the floor.  A man in the back of
the room fell over, he had been hit be the bullet too.  When the smoke
from the shot had cleared, a large sploch of blood and tissue marked
the concrete wall.  The Child swung the gun around and eyed the rest of 
the men in the room.  The fear on their faces was indescribable.  He
threw the gun down, and stepping over the body, opened the hatch leading
down to the underground communications center.  Somebody there, he hoped,
would know what the hell is going on.  If not, he would lose his patience
completly.
        On Florida Ave, the lamerz had been ordered to march on.  The
Warez House was less than a mile - they could be there in 20 minutes.
The crowds continued their cheering as the troops moved off down the avenue.
This was the moment of glory for the lamerz.  They had no warez, they
had no ANSI's, they werent on any good boards, but they knew how to kick
some serious ass.  Soon, as they turned a corner around a large cluster
of skyscrapers, they could see the Warez House.  It was under heavy guard,
but the moral of the 3l33+ guard was low.  They would be able to overtake
them with their sheer numbers.  The Guard saw them and started taking 
badly aimed shots at them, but that was ineffective.  Most of their 
heavier weapons were on the front.
        The Child swung the door of the communications center open and was
astonished at what he saw.  The Comms Manager was playing the latest Ultima
on the main terminal, the other 3 operators had their feet up on their desks.
One was reading a paper, the other was munching on WarEzZzzZ rations, the
last was snoring.  The Child reached for his .14mm automatic handblaster
with lightening speed.  The Comms guys didnt even see him before he got
the first shot off.  He hit the Manager in the neck, and he hunched over,
putting his through the 16" flat screen, gasping for air.  The Child
turned and started firing madly at the 3 others.  The guy reading the paper
took a bullet in the head and fell off his chair while the second guy 
dived for cover under his desk, to no avail.  The bullets peirced the
steel frame and shredded the lazy proletarian worker.  The third man dived
for the door leading to the service area.  He nearly pulled it off it's
hinges, but he was hit with two bullets in the stomach.  He continued
down the red-lit hallway, shedding blood along his path. He opened the door 
at the end, and closed it behind him.  He fumbled with the lock, but it
finally snapped shut before The Child caught up to him.  The Child ran into
the door with a thud, and tried the door.  Locked.  He turned back up the
hall and ran back into the Comms Center.  He sat down in the managers seat
and dialed up the mobile command unit on the front.  No response.  He 
jumped back up, and ran down the hall to the main shelter.  He swung open
the door and was horrified.  His men were gone.  He scrambled up the ladder
leading back up to the Warez House first floor.  He opened the hatch and 
ran towards the large bay window in the conference room.  He pulled the 
curtain apart, and saw his aids, advisors, and servents running across the
lawn towards the gate.  But even worse, in the distance across Modem Park,
he could see the Lamerz approaching.  He was trapped by himself in the Warez
House.  Alone.   By himself.  No warez or ANSI'z to hold onto.  
	The Fedz decided to storm the Warez House.  They sent WarezBo in to 
kick some ass.  With an M-60 fully automatic tank machine gun strapped
on, he ripped his shirt off and started to scream at the top of his lungs as
he charged up to the House.  "Holy shit!" The Child screamed as he started
to run through the house, looking for a place to hide.  WarezBo ran straight
through the door without even opening it.  He paused once inside, and looked
in both directions.  "Come out warez d00d!!!!!!!!  I'm here to pump you full 
of lead!!!" WarezBo bellowed.  Cowering under a chair, The Child pondered
the possibility of being discovered by WarezBo.  WB ran through the house
looking for The Child.  Finally, WarezBo found him under the chair...
	From the outside of the House, the Fedz could here the distant 
screams of a Warez D00de in pain.  Then gunshots...

Timebomb and Electronic Magazine hacking


        Believe it or not, since or last issue Timebomb has become a full
fledged member of the hacking community.  You always thought he was a
one dimensional warez d00d couriering warez, but that is not true.
Timebomb has other sides that we have only discovered after publishing the
second installment in the AWA series.  You see Timebomb is not a government
hacker.  He does not have a cellular hobby.  He doesn't like to rape and
pillage the local unix system or the department of motor vehicles.  No,
Timebomb is a different kind of hacker.  He is an electronic 'zine
hacker.  Laugh you must;  I would.  but Timebomb has pioneered the
profession only in a way that a Warez d00d could.  All of the editors of
e-zines around the world!  Attention!  Watch your back, or your magazine
might get hacked, by Timebomb or someone in his cult, ZHA.  'Zine hackers
of America.

        So how did this maniacal hacker come about?  And what exactly does
he do?  Well Timebomb always knew there was more out there, but between
stealing software from Microsoft, (he is an 3ll3+ supplier) and working
full time so his board can be a warez distribution site, (3ll3+ groups
charge upwards of 100 dollars a month for a distribution site to get the
latest warez) he just did not have a chance to become a real hacker like
he read about in the fifth LOD technical journal.  He wanted to go to
the hacker school the new LOD was sponsoring, but time would not let him.
Our of pure accident Timebomb became a 'zine hacker.

        Timebomb said he did not give a shit about AWA.  He said we were
all a bunch of lifeless loosers.  Some of us who have nothing better to do
than write stupid warez stories, while others spending most of their
existence on irc.  But when the first release of AWA came out, Timebomb
struck.  And boy did he strike big.  You see Timebomb really cared what we
wrote about him.  He cared about his WaReZ reputation.  And since he is a
generic insecure Warez d00d (See AWA 1: Evolution of a Warez d00d) he
needed to be accepted and could not possible have his name slandered.  So
anyways he downloaded the first AWA release.  He read it and was in shock
that such brilliance and ingenuity was possible from people with "no
lives".  He could not possibly have it spread.  He could not possibly let
them get away with something like this.  He had to do something.

        And then it hit him.  Timebomb decided to change the article.
He would slander those who have slandered him, and upload it every-
where.  Then their reputations would be shot, and they would never see
a 0 day ware in their whole existence.  It would be years before they
could even get a chance to touch a 5 day ware.  Timebomb was ecstatic
about his new plan.  But then he realized something.  Years of couriering
had rotted his brain away to the point that it only understood warez
and carding.  He did not know what to do.  He gazed at the blank screen
for hours, hoping some simple idea would come to his head, but nothing
happened.  He loaded up the slander that AWA had written, and decided
that he was not sure what he was going to do, but something had to be
done.

        Then he loaded up a ware.  Warez helped him think.  Since he was
working with text he decided to load up Wordperfect 9, stolen fresh
from the company.  "It would not be out in stores for 2 1/2 years, but
all the TGW distribution sites already had it," Timebomb thought
smugly to himself.  "That is what makes Warez worth it!" he exclaimed
loudly.  So he loaded up Wordperfect and stared some more. After
intense concentration that took a few years off his life, an idea
formed.  He would use Wordperfect Nine's elite search and replace
functions to search and replace his name with the people who slandered
him.  Thus when his handle was being slandered, it would be the handle
off his attackers.  "Brilliant!" He said.  "Sometimes I even surprise
my World Headquarters!"  The first thing that the maniacal hacker
did was search for the string 'ThoughtCrime'.  ThoughtCrime is the
main archiving center for AWA.  He replaced the string 'ThoughtCrime'
with "I hAVE NO LIFE!!!".  He smiled to himself.  Sometimes he just
did not understand where his brilliance came from.  He proceeded to
reverse all the names.  So that slander from Ozone Pilot to Timebomb
would be changed to a slander from Timebomb to Ozone Pilot.  In
Timebomb's eyes, it was a stupendous work of genius.  He had to call all
the latest boards and upload so he could burn those assholes.

        But first he needed a name for his new file.  If he renamed it
to something like AWA1REV.ZIP it would just be a rebuttal to AWA-001.ZIP
That would not work because inside Timebomb knew he could not match
wits with the charter members of the AWA.  No, he could not do that.  But
if he released his new file as AWA-003.ZIP, it would look like a genuine
AWA release, and then screw up the group even more.  Timebomb did
exactly just that, and waited for the fireworks.

        But Timebomb was brilliant in more than one way.  While hacking
out e-zine he actually insulted what his stands for.  I guess his plan
backfired.  The quote is as follows:

Timebomb:  "To say that I am against pirating software would be
hypocritical.  I am against the Warez society, the couriers, and those
ansis really fucking piss me off.  Yeh, and I use what I download, not
download for the sake of downloading.  To sum it all up, 'Warez Suck.
Huh-huh.  Huh-huh.'  Where's the 4C?"

This quote was originally by me, Jason Farnon, straight from the AWA
charter, But Timebomb used Find and Replace to change the handle to
his own.  Timebomb, if you hate ansis so much, how come you distribute zero
day ansis?  How come you have a fleet of TGW couriers ready to release
Wordperfect 9?  I'd like the answer to that question.  So I guess Timebomb
is a hypocrite on top of an idiot.

    As shown above Timebomb has not fully explored the art of magazine
hacking.  There is a lot to learn in the art, but give him time.  Soon
he may explore the uses of the delete key.  If we get real wild and crazy,
he might erase lines, and even whole paragraphs!  Now if that isn't sitting
on the shoulders of giants, I don't know what is.  I expect a elite
textfile from Timebomb to be published in the LOD technical journal six,
whenever that comes out.


AWA Damage Report:


After a very messy spill, AWA was able to recover from Timebomb's assault.
We lost two lives, and Ozone Pilot's pet hamster lost an appendage, but it
was all in the line of duty.  Don't let this happened to you.  Don't piss
off Timebomb, or he may secretly switch you electronic magazine formula
with one of a leading brand.

And now for you IRC fans:


IRC that vast pile of crap that it is can be used for some very fun and
worthwhile hobbies. One of which is slander and typing practice. Since I
do both so well here is a brief example of how to do such on the great
IRC channel #hack. #hacK is known as the #warez refugee camp. Just ask
len.

The Layman's Guide to Taking Over #Warez

        This is the first installment in a series of articles
detailing how to take over the #warez channel on irc.  I won't get too
complicated, as I would like to go over the basics with those who
don't know.  The first question that might pop into your head is "why
would I want to take over #warez?"  Well the answer to that is simple.
Tormenting WareZ d00dz lives is pleasure that cannot be described in
words.  It feels so great watching wareZ d00dz groan and suffer
knowing they cannot do anything.  Personally it gives me that warm
felling inside...

         What can you do once you take WareZ?  You can preach your
propaganda.  The Warez d00dz will have to listen.  You can ask for
the two player version of Pole Position 2.  The doodz will squirm,
wanting to kick you, but one of them will be able to!  You see warez
d00dz cannot leave #warez.  They are too stupid to realize that if 0
the left warez and all went to #warez2, a warez take over would have
no power.  There would be no one to annoy.  But warez d00dz are not
know for their intelligence.

So how do I take over warez?

        Very easily.  First of all here is a list of users who have
 automatic op status when they go into warez.  You cannot come in
 with their nick and get oped.  You need to come into #warez with
 the actual account plus nick.

Thanks to Jizmak for that list...

If you befriend one of these people they will give you op.  Or
using the right server and a hacked client you can go into
#warez and get an op.  Better yet get a hacked account so they won't
know its you, go into the #warez channel as "overlord" and say:

overlord> doodz I n33d a|\| 0p I |-|a\/3 \/\/1nD0\/\/s 3.2 N3Wzzz!@

You'll get an op right away.  As soon as you get an op, you must
run this script.

alias massdeop {
        ^set display off
        userhost $N -cmd assign mme $$3
        on ^who * if ((ischanop($1 $C))&&(mme!=[$3])){@ mlist = [$1
        $mlist]}
        on ^who "% % % user host*"
        ^who $C
        wait
        @ mcnt = 1
        set display on
        while ([$(#mlist)]>=mcnt){
                mode $C -ooo $word(${mcnt-1} $mlist) $word($mcnt
                $mlist) $word(${mcnt+1} $mlist) @ mcnt = mcnt + 3
                }
        ^on who -
        @ mlist = []
        }

It will de-op everybody in the channel.  How exactly do I run this
script you ask?  Well save it to a file in your home directory.  Say
we call it "nut".  Now go into irc and type "/load nut".  Then
when it is the appropriate time, type 'massdeop'.  Its that simple.
This is what #warez looks like if you take over it properly.

Can it be that easy you ask!?  Yes, well sort of.  Some Warez d00dz
have a mass kick/ban/deop protection on.  When it is seen that
you are massively deoping everyone, you get de-oped by the protection.
That kind of defeats the purpose.  So go in and say:

Overlord> 1 h0p3 t|-|0s3 |_a/\/\3 H/-\(k3RzzZ d0n't c0m3 1n a|\|D
+Tak3 0\/3R THe (|-|anN3LL!@#  wh0 |-|aZzz Pr0tecT10|\|?!@#

Somebody will say, I have my protection on.  Make sure you de-op
that nick first, so that he can not de-op you when you run the
script.  After you de-op him, run the script.  Its pretty simple,
but later on I will make it complicated.

Oh and one more suggestion.  Go into #warez, take it over, and flood
it with the latest awa release.  Your parents would be proud of you.

                          Mother Meets Her Fate


        My mother is a nosy bitch.  Whenever I am at the computer, she makes
it a point to creep up behind me and read what I am looking at.  Textfiles
interest her.  She thinks I am writing my plans to kill the family.  No, just
her.  So, I have this little daydream once and a while.  It goes like this:

	One day, while reading a harmless textfile I had just downloaded, my
mother rushes into the room, thinking she has caught me red handed with the
launch codes for US nuclear missles.  I tell her, as usual, that she is a
stupid bitch and to leave me alone.  She leaves the room.  Pissed beyond all
belief and fed up with her, I boot up Borland C++ (even though I have no
programming knowledge whatsoever), and devise a clever program that makes
use use of interrupts to explode the monitor at a preset time.  A screen
saver from hell.  A fragmentation non-interlaced monster.  Whee.  And even
better, it runs under Windows 2.0 or later.  So, without getting too technical,
I set up this beast to explode at 3:00pm on Sunday afternoon.  So, at 2:55pm
on Sunday, I loaded up a textfile that simply said "Fuck You", and left
it on.  I left the house, went downtown, and got a hamburger.  I return
sometime later, and sure enough, there is m0m, lying on the floor, with the
monitor case burning and glass imbedded in the walls.  I smile.

Hello.   I happened to look at /tmp in some major ftp site and found
some interesting files.   Anyways, I know CERT has sent out a advisory
already on FTP abuse.  But they didnt really address the FSP sites either.

I dont know much about the IBM scene nor care, but I figure maybe some 
of the admins would like to investigate this list and maybe clean up
their sites if they are on it and it hasnt been cleaned up.  

Maybe the SPA can get involved if someone so desires.
Here's the list.

                             The Warez Phobia


            Too many people think that all warez are bad nowadays.
        This is not true, it is the image and the people who crack
        and relase the wares that are what is evil. These are the
        people who say k-rad and elite, and really mean it. These
        are the people who are always kicked from #hack. These are
        the people who will ftp 200 megs of warez, just for the
        sake of having done it. These are the people who trash sites
        on the net with there huge amounts of -3 day garbage. These
        are not the people who use and benefit from warez.

             The majority of the people who pirate, do it because
       they actually need the software they get. They dont go and
       ftp everything single file from a wares site. Many people
       who pirate dont even admit it now, for fear of being called
       a lamer. Know that to use pirated software is completely
       acceptable, but to fall into the trap of waresdom, getting
       every file from a site, getting 'affiliated', is the worst
       sin ye can ever commit.

You and your Children



  Welcome to the counter-culture, welcome to cyberspace. The last
vestige of virtual freedom, you might ever have oppportunity to visit,
let alone enjoy.

  However as in any pioneer culture, there are setbacks and stumbling
blocks, one such setback in the digital underground is the Warez scene,
a collection of mildy retarded children, who out of knee jerk liberal
kindness have been allowed access to modems. If you have ever
encountered such social misfits, the impression I am sure was clear
enough. Some people simply should not be allowed to breed. With this in mind
I have have written up a quick file on how to avoid this dillema, and if
needed deal with it.

 First off I am assuming you are fertile (yes quite an absurd assumption
for some of you, but none the less) and someday you might find an
overweight blowbunny fucksow willing to live and presumably marry your
pathetic ass. In this instance, laws of probability state you will
unfortunately have children. Such is reality, so in view of this I have
popped up a few easy ways for you to spot if your child is becoming a
WaReZHoU|\|)!@#!#@


1: If your child keeps teling you that SVGA and the Pentium are slow and
K-fucking Lame, and that the 64k lease line is sluggish on Downloads,
this might be a warning sign..

2: If your child adopts the term Dude, and substitutes all of his 'c'
and 'k' s with X you might need to worry.

3: If your child for no reason at all, drops his pants at the computer
store, and begins to spontaniously ejaculate on the nearest software
display, you might need to worry.

4: If your child comes home with a tattoo on his forehead sporting the
logo FuCK THG, RaZoR 1911 RuLZ. This could be a good indicator.

5: If you find your child masterbating to iCE ansi work and software
packages, you might start making calls.

6: If you find your child breaks into tears from the harrasment he gets
on #hack, this is a dead give away.

7: If you find bizzarre sticky stains on the monitor after your kids
fires up Cshow, this could be bad news.

8: If your kids litterally shits himself whenever he hears the word SPA.

9: If he tells you Christ has nothing on Rusty, from Rusty and Eddies in
the way of martyrdom, it's worrying time.

10: And most of all, if your child seems to finds gifs of Gail Thackeray
kind of attractive in a weird kinda way.....

 Ok with this in mind here are several sure fire cures.

1: Down grade the modem to 300 baud.

2: Beat him severely over the frontal lobe of his brain to induce
epilepsy, and fuck with the vga display on your moniter, so it strobes
and he has Grande Mal siezures when he plays games.

3: Cut off his strap him in a chair roll all his favorite gifs of Deanna
Troy from star trek accross his screen whilst playing Billy Idols latest
record, this should be enough to turn him off computers.

4: Leave him stranded in #hack for several hours, with the Handle
IFuckF3rWaReZ.

5: Simply beat his lame little ass whenever he sets near a computer with
that frenetic "I'm jonesing fer sum Kings quest " look in his beady
little eyes.

6: Subject him to a VaxBuster alliance with RAgent to play head
games with him.

7: And finnaly, give him a chinese style execution in the backyard and
bill Razor for the bullet.

                               THE END

                      "Please Mr. C0urier -- D0n't Sh00t"

                              by, Alexander Kn0x

        Pity the p00r warez c0urier.  N0bly they make their app0inted r0unds in
spite 0f being t0ssed ar0und and abused like they were s0me kind 0f rag d0ll.
0h the things these 3133+ d00dez w0uld d0 f0r rec0gniti0n.  "N0 $300.00 ph0ne
bill will st0p me fr0m being the c0urier that br0ught Kings Quest XIVIXVX t0
New England," as they hurried thr0ugh the file secti0ns 0f the RZR, FLT, 0r
whatever cracking gr0up they were slaving f0r that day.  Every0ne fr0m the
Sys0p's 0f the best 0 day ANSi b0ardz t0 the new user 0n the 35 dayz WaRez
b0ards c0mplains ab0ut h0w sl0wly their area gets such and such ware.  All 0f
this fell 0n the c0urier's sh0ulders.  0h h0w I feel f0r th0se c0uriers.

        Yet these threats fr0m the 0utside pale next t0 the dangers that lurk
0n the 0ther side 0f the screen.  F0r all the excitement, n0thing seri0us
happens after the l0ss 0f a c0urier t0 the side 0f g00d.  A few n0n-0 day
b0ardz are terminated; a few 0 day b0ardz hear murmur's fr0m inside the cracks
0f the seams 0f their f0rum hacks.  The Sys0p's may have the c0uriers by the
neck, but they aren't danger0us.  The same can't be said f0r the c0uriers
themselves.  Y0u kn0w what I'm talking ab0ut.  There are times when warez
aren't realeased f0r weeks.  0r when certain gr0ups g0 0n dr0ughts 0f 0nly
releasing usefull utilities instead 0f useless games.  These are the times
that the real c0urier's shine thr0ugh.  These are the t0ugh times.

        During the last year, 49 c0urier's have killed 323 b0ard-members all-
t0gether.  And their targets aren't the quiet 0nes wh0 rarely make an appear-
ance in the message bases, and just call f0r the 0ccaisi0nal warez.  Their
targets are the whiners, bitchers and m0aners.  The users wh0 when the 0-day
warez aren't fl0wing like a m0untain stream, start bitching and m0aning.  And
m0st 0f this bitching and m0aning, (99% 0f it) is directed at the C0URIERS.
I am g0ing t0 f0cus 0n 1 c0urier wh0 stuck 0ut in MY mind as the 3l33+ist.

        The c0urier I w0uld like t0 tell y0u ab0ut g0es by the handle 0f (rad)
"Evil Nitr0".  He c0uriered f0r Raz0r t0 the 617 and 203 area c0des and distri-
buted his warez t0 the l0cal b0ards he called. He had t0 call Raz0r's Eur0pean
Head Quarters t0 get the warez 5 times a week.  N0w after the calls t0 the EHQ,
his calls t0 617 & 203 and his regular bbs calls Evil Nitr0 was racking up $350
a m0nth in l0ng distance charges.  N0w I kn0w y0ur thinking, "why didn't
this idi0t use c0des 0r dial0uts."  Well that's just it, he was an idi0t and
didn't kn0w ab0ut these new-fangled ideas.  Well this chilly winter had
apparently g0tten t0 Raz0r and they were 0n a mean c0ld streak f0r warez. They
hadn't released a file in 3 weeks and their last release was just an0ther
V/2 beta.

        Well 0ne 0f the l0cal b0ards he distributed t0, "Shad0w Undergr0und",
had been planning a get t0gether 0f s0rts f0r all the users t0 c0me, trade
warez and talk ab0ut the latest releases and ANSi art.  Well it just s0 happens
that this bbs was the 0ne that Evil Nitr0 t00k the m0st abuse fr0m.  The users
were disgruntled at the sl0wness 0f Raz0r.  They t00k it all 0ut 0n Evil Nitr0.
0ne night while scanning thr0ugh the newest messages ab0ut him that en0ugh was
en0ugh and he w0uld take advantage 0f this "warez picnic" and get his revenge.

        The day 0f the highly t0uted "Shad0w Undergr0und 3l33t Gathering" came.
Evil Nitr0 arrived at the ch0sen meeting place (s0 sekret we can't even menti0n
it here) and reviewed his plan.  He f0und the secti0n that had the greatest
view 0f the main meeting hall.  This is where his eVIL plan began.  He revealed
a gatling gun fr0m his duffle bag with 6000 arm0r piercing bullets, all 0f
which he carded at a l0cal p0lice aucti0n (in his real name 0f c0urse).  He
set up high and watched as the d00dez began t0 file in.  At ab0ut n00n 27 0f
them were huddled t0gether f0r a speech fr0m the Sys0p 0f Shad0w Undergr0und.
They all whispered t0 each0ther ab0ut h0w they weren't surprise that Evil Nitr0
had n0t sh0wn up at the c0nventi0n 0' warez.  "He has taken my messages t0
heart", they th0ught as the Sys0p talked 0n.  Evil Nitr0 readied his weap0n.
He decided the best time t0 take acti0n w0uld be when all the d00dez st00d up
and applauded f0r the Sys0p's speech.  Seven minutes later, the speech ended
and the d00dez st00d up just as planned.  Suddenly hundreds 0f bullets flew
thr0gh the sky t0wards the d00dez.  They st00d there alm0st fr0zen at this
sight.  Up in the balc0ny Nitr0 c0ntinued t0 fire sh0ts at them.  He w0uldn't
st0p until they were all dead.  After ab0ut eight minutes 0f c0ntinu0s sh00ting
Nitr0 st0pped.  All 0f the warez d00dez lay dead 0n the fl00r in a p00l of
bl00d.  Evil Nitr0 dr0pped his weap0n and started t0 laugh insanely as he was
gunned d0wn by the NYC c0ps.  The h0rr0r.

        And the vi0lence sh0ws n0 signs of abating.  Mid 1993 has yet t0 pr0-
duce a h0rr0r such as the 0ne described ab0ve.  But the c0uriers are still at
it.  For c0uriers are wedded t0 each 0ther and their pr0fessi0n by b0nds
rivalling th0se 0f 0ld-time 0rganized crime.  The leeches are safe.  For like
the gangsters 0f y0re, c0uriers 0nly kill each 0ther.

        This evolution chart is only an example of how some people
       go through the wares scene. It is how most of the people I
       have seen locally go through it, so i used it for an example.
       There are an almost endless amount of ways this can go on.
       Taking all this into account:

WarezSex

    I didn't think it could get any lamer.  But believe me, sometimes
when you drop a stone into the pit of lameness it takes hours before
you hear it hit the bottom.  Warez are lame.  This has been established.
There is something called "netsex" which is just plain fucking scary.

It constitutes one irc user typing erotic messages to another irc user
while both of them masturbate.  That is just sad.  But now we have
sunk to an all new low:  WareZSex!  Yes, Warez D00Dz having netsex.
I was able to play along with a warez d00d as he got off and captured
it.  To tell you the truth, his talk of western digital hard drives
just made me sick.
    The following transcript has not been changed at all.  The only
thing I edited out is warez d00dz giving each other 'op' status.  You
see when a WareZ d00d goes into the #warez channel, everyone has
that nickname set to auto-op, so he gets oped by 15 different people.
Its very scary, but WareZ d00dz enjoy that.  You cannot have op wars
if nobody is op.  If I had left the ops in here, this file would have
been 700k.  Scary...
    To go on, everything is an exact quotation, except the stuff in
'[ ]'.  Those are my quotes.  Lines starting with a '>' are messages
posted by me to the public.  A nickname in stars (i.e. *CR*) followed
by a message is someone sending a private message to me.  An arrow
followed by a nickname in stars (i.e. -> *CR*) is me sending a private
message to someone.

Congratulations, asshole. You have posted the best ever list here. 
If I ever should meet you, I will physically beat you up, which will cause 
severe injuries.  

Meanwhile we'll do our best to make you go insane. Better cancel your

get a life.

If I found any site that I administrated in that list, I'd be sure to
"correct the situation" ASAP.  It's hard enough to run an ftpd with a
writable incoming directory without getting xgifs and "get rich quick"
files.

Now, I have to watch all my guest users for fsp daemons.  I've already
wiped a few clients, but I have not seen and archives being created.
Of course, I've also wiped muds, bots, sub-bbses and all kinds of
yphack/ypbreak/ypsnarf/ypblah programs.  I don't have the time to
watch every tcpip connection to verify its validity.... now I have a
few ip/ports to add to my netwatcher so a program can do it for me.

antitrack/legend the supplier of old warez.. Id like to thank CoolCat,
Jizmak, ZigZag and QueenF from IRC for supplying the lists.  Join AWA.

Warez are lame, and abusin Internet for them is even lamer.  Keep pirates

Congratulations! I think it is the best way to post such lists to inform
some sysadmins about the illegal use of their sites.
