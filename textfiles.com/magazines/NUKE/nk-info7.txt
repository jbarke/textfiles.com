IJ#6 Errata
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately several mistakes were made in NuKE InfoJournal #6.
Article #4 ("IRIS Guide") was written by Nitro-187, not Ned-239 as
indicated in some copies of the InfoJournal.  In article #2 ("A Guide to
the North American Numbering System"), by Nowhere Man, the non-published
number percentage chart should list Bakersfield, California as being in
area code 805.  We apologize for any inconvenince to our readers or
writers.


Two Years Of NuKE!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This month marks the second year of NuKE's existance!  NuKE was founded
in August 1991 as an H/P group local to 514 (Montreal, Canada).  Since
then NuKE has matured and evolved in to an international pro-virus
group with a worldwide network and many inovative products.  Two
years may not seem like much, but there have been very few "groups"
that have lasted this long...


News From Europe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NuKE now has four sites in Europe, adding Land of Lost Souls in
Sofia, Bulgaria (sysop:  Winnie the Pooh).  Winnie is working on adding
sites in the former USSR and other parts of Eastern Europe.  Savage
Beast reports that sites are under consideration in Spain; he is unable
to add any French sites because of overzealous computer crime laws in
that country.  A Belgian site is on the way, too.  Besides Land of Lost
Souls, NuKE maintains three boards in Switzerland, one in the French-
speaking areas and two in the German-speaking areas.  NuKE's European branch
is finally growning again after the closing of several of its sites due
to hardware problems, personal difficulties, and police raids.


NuKE Site Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cybernetic Violence, NuKE's world headquarters, now has a new number.      
It can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at +1 514 426 9194.        
The old number is no longer valid!  Cybernetic Violence (sysop:  Pure      
Energy) is located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and runs 24 hours/day      
7 days/week at 14.4k v.32bis.  Cybernetic Violence is also the central
hub of NuKENet.
                                                                           
The Hell Pit (sysop:  Hades), located in Chicago, Illinois, USA, has
upgraded its modem and is now running at 14.4k v.32bis.  The Hell Pit
can be reached 24 hours/day 7 days/week at +1 708 459 7267.

                                                                           
New 500 Area Code                                                          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                          
In July 1993 Bellcore, the agency designated to assign area codes          
and exchanges (NXXs) for the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean,              
announced that starting sometime in August (pending U.S. government        
approval) it will allocate numbers in the 500 NPA for use by               
personal communication services.  Exchanges will be handed out             
to corporations if they show a real need -- already AT&T and               
Atlantic Bell have asked for exchanges.  In the future, NPA 500            
will probably also be used for cellular phones, pagers, and other          
mobile services.                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                           
Quelle Horrible!  Rock Steady French?!                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                     
In an interview done by Netta Gilboa of _Gray Areas_ Magazine              
(an excellent publication, highly recommended) with Urnst Kouch,           
published in Gray Areas no. 3 and reprinted in Computer Underground Digest 
vol. 5 no. 44, Urnst Kouch states in error that "Rock Steady is            
French-Canadian."  We here at NuKE would like to make it very clear that   
Rock Steady is not French, never was French, and never will be French.     
Not everyone who lives in Quebec is a Francophone...                       
                                                                           
                                                                           
NuKENet -- One Year Old And Still Growing!                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                 
This summer marks the first anniversary of the creation of NuKENet.        
NuKENet began in mid-1992 as a mail link between Cybernetic Violence
in Canada and Total Mayhem in Australia.  It has since grown into          
a huge multinational network with sites in Europe, Africa, Australia,      
and North America.  In fact, NuKENet can now be reached via the FidoNet    
backbone at NUKE_THEWORLD -- request it today!

Area Split For Alabama                                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     
On July 22, 1993 South Central Bell announced that Alabama will become     
the first state to gain an interchangable (NXX) area code.  In 1995 area   
code 205 will split; Huntsville and Birmingham will remain in 205, while   
Montgomery and Mobile will move to area code *334*.  More details
will be published as they become available.                                
                                                                           
The following chart summerizes the remaining North American area code

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                         
Special thanks to Vest from 708 for an intresting tidbit of information --
spent three volt lithium batteries (model number CR-2032) will register    
as nickles in coin-operated vending machines!  Use old, exhausted          
batteries only, though, since new batteries are around US$2.00 each...     
This has only been tested in the U.S., but the CR-2032 is even closer      
in circumference and weight to the Canadian nickle.  If you call around, you
might be able to pick up bags of spent batteries for "recycling."  Note:
this information is for informational purposes only, and is meant to alert
owners of coin-operated devices so that such fraudulent acts might be      
detected and prevented.


Tough Swiss Anti-Piracy Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In response to rampant piracy throughout the country the Swiss government
has enacted tough new anti-piracy laws that force people convicted of
using pirated software to name the person(s) providing the software or
face additional penalties.  In Switzerland piracy has been particularly
bad, with most businesses using pirated software and some huge pirate
boards charging up to US$500 for unlimited access to copyrighted programs.
Viruses are not affected by the new law:  possessing and creating viruses
are still legal in Switzerland.


Anti-Virus Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Savage Beast has conducted experiments with various anti-virus products
and has concluded that "a lot of them only look good...they're really
shit."  No surprise there...however Savage has provided us with scientific
data to back up his claims.  Below are the results of scanning with the
latest versions (as of July 1993) of various virus scanners -- judge for
yourself:

Product     Maker          Virus Tested  Virus Found  MTE Tested  MTE Found
~~~~~~~     ~~~~~          ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~

XScan       Anyware                2547         2151         200        200

As you can see, even the "best" products (F-Prot, XScan, SCAN) will miss
between 15% and 20% of current viruses.  Even if you think your computer
is "protected" from viruses you can still get a virus from one out of five
infected programs...and that's not counting MTE-using viruses -- only three
of the scanners provide acceptable protection against the Mutation Engine,
which has been out for over two and a half years.  Each time you put a
new disk in your floppy drive, ask yourself if this might be the "1 in 5."

With international telephone services becoming more and more integrated and
international calls becoming more and more common, it only makes sense than
calling cards would also evolve to ease international calling.  AT&T       
Calling Cards are usable to call back to the U.S. from over 170 different  
countries, and to even call *between* 46 countries outside the U.S. (called
AT&T World Connect<tm> service).  The AT&T USADirect Service<tm> is        
available in over 110 countries.  This service connects you immediately    
back to an English-speaking AT&T operator in the U.S., who will take your  
calling card number and place your call for you.  The following is the     
procedure for using USADirect:                                             
                                                                           
1. Dial the USADirect access number for the country you're calling from.   
                                                                           
2. An English-language voice prompt will ask for the telephone number      
   you are calling.  Enter the area code and seven-digit phone number.     
                                                                           
3. After the tone, enter your 14-digit AT&T Calling Card number, which     
   includes the last four digits, your PIN.  If you're calling collect,    
   press zero for an English-speaking operator.                            
                                                                           
If you are at a telephone that does not have access to automated service,  
simply wait for the English-speaking AT&T operator to greet you. To call   
from country to country using World Connect<tm> service, please wait for   
the AT&T operator to assist you.  The operator will ask for your AT&T      
Calling Card number and place the international call for you.  To place    
additional calls, press # after your party hangs up and follow the voice   
prompts.                                                                   
                                                                           
To call 800 numbers, ask the AT&T operator to connect you.  Unfortunately, 
she will only connect calls to AT&T 800 customers...however, this USADirect
service can be used by people who live outside the U.S. to reach 800       
numbers.  You don't need to have an AT&T Calling Card to do this.          
                                                                           
Use your regular AT&T Calling Card number, not the international number.

Notice that most numbers include 011, the international dialing prefix in  
the U.S. and Canada, or 288, "ATT" on the telephone keypad...  Note that
Canada is not included in the list since AT&T Calling Cards can be used in 
Canada the same way they are used in the U.S. (0+NPA+NXX-XXXX or placed    
through the operator).  The following countries will accept AT&T Calling   
Cards, but access to USADirect is restricted to special phones at certain  
places that Americans tend to congregate (hotels, airports, rail stations, 
etc.):  Barbados, Ethiopia, Mexico, Qatar, Romania, St. Lucia, Seychelles  
Islands, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, Uganda, and  
Yemen.                                                                     
                                                                           
AT&T USADirect is an easy way to call the U.S. from abroad.  Of course,    
you have to have an AT&T Calling Card to use the service...  Happily, AT&T 
will issue calling cards to people who do not use AT&T long distance       
service, including people who do not live in the USA.  Call (800) 525 7955 
for more information on obtaining an AT&T Calling Card outside the U.S. (or
call (800) 222 0300 if you want to obtain a calling card billed to your    
U.S. home phone line).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% Cellular System Operation %

The Cellular Mobile Telephone Systems is a low-powered, full duplex, radio/
telephone which operates between 800 and 900 Mhz, using multiple transceiver
sites linked to a central computer for coordination. The sites, or "cells",
named for their honeycomb shape, cover a range of three to six, or more, miles.
(five to nine kilometres) in each direction. Their range is limited only by
certain natural or man-made objects. 

The cells overlap one another and operate at different transmitting and 
receiving frequencies in order to eliminate cross-talk when transmitting from
cell to cell. Each cell can accommodate up to 45 different voice channel 
transceivers. When a cellular phone is activated, it searches available 
channels for the strongest signal and locks on to it. While in motion, if 
signal strength begins to fade, the telephone will automatically switch signal
frequencies or cells as necessary without operator assistance. It fails to
find an acceptable signal, it will display an "out of service" or "no service"
message, indicating that it has reached the limit of its range and is unable to
communicate.


% Identification %

Each mobile telephone has a unique identification number which allows the Mobile
Telephone Switching Office (MTSO) to track and coordinate all mobile phones in 
its service area. This ID number is known as the Electronic Security Number 
(ESN). The ESN and Telephone Number are NOT the same. The ESN is permanent 
number engraved into a memory chip called a PROM or EPROM, located in the
telephone chassis. 

This number cannot be changed through programming as the telephone number
can, although it can be replaced. Each time the telephone is used, it 
transmits its ESN to the MTSO by means of DTMF tones during the dialling
sequence. The MTSO can determine which ESN's are good or bad, thus individual
numbers can be banned from use within the system.

Call Switching 

Cell sites switching is done automatically by the MTSO. The MTSO constantly
monitors signal strength data of both the caller and the receiver. To maintain
signal quality, when signal strength begins to fade, the MTSO locates the next
best cell site and re-routes the channels to maintain the communications link.
The switch takes approximately 300 milliseconds and is not noticeable to the
user. All switching is handled by computer, with the control channels telling
each cellular unit when and where to switch.


% The Numeric Assignment Module (NAM) %

A Numeric Assignment Module, or NAM, is a programmable, read-only-memory (PROM).
The NAM holds a limited amount of data, usually only 128 or 256 bits. NAM's 
used are typically made by either NEC or Signetics. Common chip numbers are 
82S23, 82S123 or equivalent. Other NAM's are manufactured by National 
Semiconductors, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, AMD and others. The NAM is actually
a 32-word by 8 bit PROM which is programmed with a PROM programmer/burner. The
32x8 PROM (256 bits, 32 word by 8 bit) bits are like fuses. A programmer will
trigger certain fuses within the NAM in order to give the phone a unique
identity and certain options. 

NAM's are easy to purchase. Only the number of the chip is needed to buy one.
Consulting the latest issue of an IC MASTER is one way to determine what's 
inside the chip and who distributes it. 

The NAME is used to store the Mobile Identification Number (MIN), Lock Code,
the Home Systems Identification number (SIDH), and various other system
data. From the beginning address of the NAM, 00, you will find the System
Identification Home number (SIDH). Each market allows for two systems. These 
two digits are even for the wire-line and odd for the non-wireline. 

There are two kinds of NAMs used in cellular telephones:
"TRI-STATE" and "OPEN COLLECTOR" It is _mandatory_ to identify the type of
NAM in your cellular telephone before attempting to replace it. After it has
been identified, any of the electronic supply companies should be able to 
supply a replacement. A TRI-STATE NAM can be used in over 95% of the cellular
telephones on the market today containing replaceable NAM's.

*** The NEC cellular series will _only_ accept tri-state NAM's ***

The identify the NAM chip compare the numbers in the READILY AVAILABLE NAME
TYPES table to the various chips on the circuit board for a match. The NAM 
chip is usually factory mounted on a ZIF socket.

*** Motorola handheld phones, require special NAM's. Try calling the 
    cellular phone stores in your area. ***

% Cell Terms for the above abbreviations %

A/B : A switch located on the mobile telephone that allows the user to select
      which frequency black (carrier) he or she wishes to use. Some telephones
      have an internal switch from one block to the other when service is not
      available on the pre-set block. 

ACCOLC : Access Overload Class. There is no standard in use within the 
         United States at this time. This system offers priority depending
         on how it is selected in the event of system overload. Typically
         set to 0 plus the last digit of the phone number to provide random
         loading. Originally, when the Federal government began designing
         cellular systems, they intended to give emergency vehicles (such as
         police, ambulances, and Fire Departments) codes that would allow them
         priority over other subscribers, to communicate during emergencies.

EE : End to End signalling. DTMF signals are sent through the lines to
     signal the end of a conversation. A tone code is also used to access
     long distance carriers, to signal your answering machine, or to access 
     your voice mail.

GIM : Group Identification Mark. This is a two-digit number assigned by the
      cellular carrier which determines roaming rights throughout the system.
      As cellular systems are upgraded, the GIM will be on line real time,
      requiring all NAM information, including the Mobile Identification 
      Number (MIN), to be validated before a subscriber is allowed to call
      outside of their home area. 

IPCH : Initial Paging Channel. 334 - wireline systems. 333 - non-wirelne 
       systems.

LOCK DIGIT : This field is a one - four digit code. It locks the cellular
             telephone to prevent unauthorized use. The lock code is 
             programmed into the NAM, and is frequently factory set to
             either 1234 or 0004.

LU : Local Use flag. Occasionally used to initialize approval for local calls.
     The cellular carrier insures that local users are registered with a
     local system. Hackers use the Roaming Technique to avoid this 
     complication.

HA : Horn Alert. 0 or 1. A 1 in this field tells the cellular phone that
     this feature is available.

HF : Hands Free. 0 or 1. A 1 in this field tells the cellular phone that
     this feature is enabled.

MIN1 : Mobile Identification Number. The telephone number assigned to 
       the telephone by the cellular carrier. If the telephone is brought
       in, or a new one is purchased, the cellular service assigns this 
       number for both billing and for receiving calls. 7 or 10 digits in
       length.

MIN2: The area code of the cellular phone number.

MIN MARK : Can be 0 or 1. The home station sends extended address data upon
           origination and page response.

REP : Repertory dialling. Speed dialling. Some phones are capable of storing
      100 numbers.

SCM : Station Class Mark. Identifies the phone as either a hand-held or 
      transportable/fixed cellular phone. SCM is determined by the transmit
      power of the phone (0.8 watts for hand-held, 1.2, 3.0 watts for 
      transportable/fixed)

SIDH : Home System Id. Code used to identify the Home system where the cellular
       telephone is registered. (See the Home System Id Listing Article)


% What About the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) %

An Electronic Serial Number, or ESN, is the unique, 32-bit, eleven-digit
serial number for each cellular telephone sold. The ESN is transmitted each
time a cellular telephone places a call. It is used to verify whether a 
cellular telephone is registered with an authorized carrier. A dealer needs 
the ESN in order to restore the service on a used phone. 

The first three numbers are the manufacturer's decimal code. The fourth and
fifth are reserved, and may contain any digit, zero through nine. The 
remaining six numbers are the decimal serial number for each individual
phone.

      Manufacturers    Reserved    Decimal serial number
         ESN code        0-9          of the phone

The decimal serial number can occasionally be found within the documentation
provided with a new cellular phone. In some cases, the ESN is engraved on
the telephone itself, but this is not universal with all manufacturers. 

If a cellular telephone has been disconnected for any reason, the ESN must be
provided in order for service to be reestablished with the Carrier. Each 
manufacturer assigns their own ESN to every mobile telephone. Therefore, a
single ESN may be duplicated by one or more manufacturers. A hacker may 
bypass this system by altering other system information and leaving the 
particular telephone's ESN unaltered. 

*** CHANGING the ESN is THE ONLY SURE WAY to minimize any risk of getting
    caught ***

The ESN is assigned at the factory, and in almost all cases, is the only 
element that cannot be altered by use of the programming sequence without 
removing it and replacing it with a new chip. The ESN chip is always factory
soldered and occasionally epoxide onto the circuit board to reduce tampering.
A decent hacker will be able to remove it and install a ZIF (Zero Insertion
Force) socket in its place. The ZIF socket makes it easy to replace the ESN
chip at any time. The NAM chip usually factory installed in a ZIF socket.


% How to locate the ESN %

Several methods are available for locating a cellular telephone ESN. These 
methods are as follows:

  1. The ESN is normally located on a PROM. The ESN is intentionally made to
     be unerasable on most cellular phones to prevent the fraudulent use of
     the phone. The PROM is programmed and installed at the factory with the
     security fuse blown in order to prevent tampering. The ESN code on a PROM
     may be read by removing the PROM from the cellular telephone and placing
     it in a PROM reader to obtain a memory map of the chip. The ESN PROM is
     distinctive because of its size and package. The ESN PROM will have 
     between sixteen and twenty-eight leads, in a square or rectangular 
     package. This is a BIPOLAR PROM. Most cellular telephones will accept
     the National Semiconductor 32x8 PROM, which cannot be reprogrammed. 
     If a hacker knew the ESN of a particular cellular telephone, it is 
     possible to trace the memory map by installing the PROM in a reader and
     obtaining a fuse map by use of the READ MASTER switch of the PROM 
     programmer. Many PROM programmers contain a VERIFY and COMPARE switch
     to provide a comparison of one PROM's programming with another. 

     This may be a complicated task for the first-timer, so it is 
     recommended that a cellular telephone (bag phones are best) is
     purchased strictly for the purpose of dismantling it in order to locate
     the ESN. This will probably destroy the telephone, but will provide
     valuable experience.

 *** Some of the newer hand-held phone manufacturers (Motorola) are changing
     to VLSI (very large scale integration) which combine several other chips
     with the ESN chip, preventing hackers from programming those ships. Bag
     phones are almost an easy hack. ***
 
  2. Hire a "Cellular Consultant." A consultant is someone who works as an
     installer and/or programmer, and would be able to show the user where
     the ESN is located.

  3. Get in touch with a local cellular telephone servicer and simply ask 
     for their help in identifying the memory chips in the telephone. Most
     technicians will help without too much difficulty. (It's called 
     social engineering)

  4. As a last resort, remove each memory chip and place it in a PROM reader.
     When one if found that registers a reading, the ESN has been located.

  5. Take the phone to a cellular service provider and ask them to provide
     the ESN. They are often requested for insurance purposes, and can be
     supplied easily enough by use of a Cellular Service Monitor. The monitor
     reads the transmissions from the telephone and indicates the specific ESN.

  6. The ESN is also normally provided with the original user information, if
     available. 

  7. ESN chips may be identified by some of the following manufacturers'
     markings: 
        AMD, AMPS, DM, HARRIS, HM, MOTOROLA, MB, MMI, NS, NSC, TBP, TI.

*** ESN Readers are also available for personal purchase. See "Buyers Guide" 
    article for further information on Personal Readers. ***


% Replacing the ESN %

Now that you've located the ESN, how do you replace it? The ESN needs to be
unsoldered in order to remove it. The user should be familiar with soldering
techniques, extra care must be taken not to touch any of the surrounding
connections, solder joints or chips. I do recommend you get a de-soldering
pen, you should get the pen with the suction pump, it will remove the 
solder nicely. Chip pullers and de-soldering tools are available from any
electronical semiconductors store, even Radio Shack. 

The following steps will aid in ESN removal:

1. Unscrew and remove the entire PC board containing the ESN. This is done 
   to prevent inadvertent damage to the rest of the unit during the 
   removing process. 

2. Once you have determined which is the correct ESN chip, it is wise to make
   a sketch of it to insure that it is replaced in the proper place and
   direction. (Don't laugh, just DO IT.)

3. Using extreme caution, unsolder and remove the chip from the board. 

4. Solder in a ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket to provide for easier removal
   and placement of additional chips. 

*** WARNING: No retailer, manufacturer or servicer will work on a unit in
     which the ESN has been removed. In addition, it is their responsibility
     to notify the proper authorities of such tampering. So if you screw up
     get a _trustable_ friend to help or trash the unit. ***

5. Once the ZIF socket has been installed, reinsert the ESN and attempt to
   place a call. If the call is successfully completed, the ESN has been 
   properly removed and replaced. If the call does not go through, recheck
   the leads on the ZIF socket for proper installation.

6. Insert the ESN in a PROM reader to be sure it gets a reading. Use the
   search mode to identify the Manufacturer's Serial Number, in order to
   identify the first three addresses of the ESN on the PROM where 
   reprogramming will be done. 


% Programming the ESN %

Insert the ESN in a PROM programmer to be sure it gets a reading. Use the
search mode and "read master" to identify the Manufacturer's Serial Number,
in order to identify the first three addresses of the ESN on the PROM fuse
map where programming the new chip will be done. Record the locations of the
ESN. Use the "edit buffer" command to change one number of the ESN. A new PROM
is then programmed with the PROM programmer. Instructions will come with the
programmers. 

The entire PROM reading/emulating/programming process is relatively fast when 
a personal computer is available. (Some PROM programmers allow RS-232 interface
with the IBM-PC clone, with the help of a computer program.) This will allow
the use of an EPROM emulator and allow you to program (burn) PROM chips 
directly from the computer. 

The Installation of the ZIF socket makes it possible to insert an EPROM
emulator into the socket. The hacker will often try a hundred or more ESN codes
before finding a good one. Use of an EPROM Emulator will allow the hacker to
load ESN codes without burning EPROMs until a good code is found and will 
save the hacker hundreds of chips with the wrong codes programmed into them.

Use the emulator and the code read from the original chip, re-code a new PROM.
Change the original ESN code by one number. Load the emulator and try making
a phone call. Keep trying this process until a call is completed. The entire
process is often completed in less than one-two hours.

A Programmer for use with a personal computer will allow the hacker to store 
codes for easy editing and reprogramming new chips when the Cellular carrier
blocks the particular ESN is use. Use the working ESN code from above to burn
a new PROM and insert into the ZIF.

*** Most smart hackers also change the SIDH and MIN on the NAM in order 
    to minimize the possibility of being caught. ***
*** Remember Hackers will always be smart about who they are calling and
    any traceable calling habits. ***

Some other manufacturer's cellular telephones are privately labelled for 
certain companies. However, when reprogramming a cellular telephone, any
valid ESN code will work on any phone. The numbers listed bellow are all

% The ROAMing Technique %

Cellular telephones have a ROAM mode, which indicates that the user is in an
area other than his or her "home" area. This ability allows the user to place
a call in an area away from his own, such as another state, and allows the 
phone to be used when travelling or commuting. However, it is impossible for the
local MTSO to know when an "outsider" is on-line in their area, therefore,
incoming calls are not available when ROAMing unless a Call Following feature
is activated by the cellular carrier.

Cellular carriers have common agreements to cross-bill applicable charges, 
including extra charges for being an "outsider", when a cellular user takes
advantage of the roaming capabilities of a cellular telephone. 

It is possible for a user to make a call when ROAMing and not be billed. The
local area MTSO may put the call through and bill it to the registered user
at a later date, only to learn that the caller was using a stolen number. Keep
in mind that all call information is recorded and can be traced. It is 
possible for the authorities to follow up with the "called" party. The calls
most frequently followed up on are calls repeatedly made to the same number
(the user's home number, family members, friends, etc) and noticeable trends
in calling (calling from the same cell each time, calling at the same time of
day, the same area, etc.) 

The "ROAMing Technique" is frequently used, due to the fact that carriers 
normally will not commit to the time and expense of tracing a call to recoup
the small amount lost on short calls (less than one percent of these calls are
deemed a sufficient loss to be followed up on). 

This method requires the NAME be programmed with a fake SIDH (refer to the 
Home System ID article). This may provide access for a limited time. A smart
hacker knows to ignore any message to contact the cellular carrier. 


% Clone Approach %

A cellular phone can also be reprogrammed to imitate another cellular phone.
This is done for two reasons. First, the owner of two cellular phones does
not want to pay two individual service charges since he only uses one phone at 
a any given time. Secondly, a hacker wants to make free phone calls that will 
be charged to another cellular user. This approach will work until the wrongly
charged user reports these charges to the carrier at the end of the month
when they get their bill. Called numbers will probably be investigated for the
source. 

The entire ESN and NAM (MIN components) are required to accomplish cloning.
The NAM parameters of one phone should be programmed into the other. The ESN
PROM of the first should be read and programmed into the second. The idea is
to make both phones appear to the carrier as the same phone. If an ESN of a
particular phone is not known, then a Cellular Service Monitor or ESN Reader
will be necessary. Most cellular service centres will have one or you can
look in at the Buyer's Guide Article. 

Only one phone can be used at any given time. Both phones, will try respond
to incoming calls. The phone that offers the most powerful link will be 
connected to break the connection of the other, weaker phone link. 


Refer to the first part on how to program the ESN/NAM.

Well, here it is, the DaeMaen virus...the binary has been out for quite a
while now.  Two versions of DaeMaen exist; the source code presented here
is from the first version.  The changes made in the second version were
minor.  You'll need to assemble this with the A86 assembler.  It is *not*
compatible with MASM or TASM due to some minor directive differences, but
it can easily be modified to compiler under the more popular assemblers
(we chose to present to you the original, untouched source code, straight
from the author).

It is an extremely nice piece of work, only 2k in size, quite tight for
all that code (it does .COM, .EXE, .SYS, .BIN, .OVL, and boot sector
infections).  However it is somewhat lacking:  some methods of infection
are somewhat lacking, and I'm not too thrilled about the technique of
infecting on file closes.  Nevertheless, I find it extrordinary learning
material.

[Note:  TaLoN aka Terminator-Z is no longer with NuKE due to legal problems.
After being investigated by Australian authorities for illegal activities
totally unconnected to his role in NuKE, he decided to take the heat off
himself by "turning in" members of NuKE for crimes that they never committed.
It is sad to see such a fine programmer do something so dispicable and
underhanded, and we at NuKE regret his decision.  We wish him all the best
in the courts... -NM]

        This file contains the entries of uncommon or rare explosives.
By this, it is meant that the following compounds have explosive properties, 
but are not used as commercial/military explosives and/or they are generally 
unknown to the public.  They may not be used as commercial/military
explosives for a number of reason, some of which may be:  lack of stability,
cost of materials, difficulty of synthesis, cost of synthesis, toxicity, etc.
The general format of the compound entries will be as follows:

Entry:                  Entry Number
Name:                   Common Name
IUPAC Name:             IUPAC Designated Name
Condensed Formula:      Molecular Formula / Structural Condensed Formula
Physical Properties:    Some physical properties of the explosive
Explosive Properties:   The explosive properties of the compound
Manufacture:            The manufacturing procedure, and lab preparation
                        procedure (if given)
Use:                    The use
Toxicity (if known):    Toxicity, and side effects if known

NOTE:  Most of the following compounds are highly dangerous.  Due to this
       fact, this article has been written for the knowledge of the 
       explosives rather than the experience of making them.  Thus, the
       manufacture of each explosive compound will not be given in a step
       by step "how to" fashion, but rather just the bare minimum reactant
       chemicals (if given).  The author holds no responsibility for the
       way any individual, or group uses the following information.

        Being interested in explosives as I am, and not seeing any
new files on explosives (or new explosives themselves), I decided to
write this file, based on a huge chemistry reference manual containing
more than 10,000 chemical compounds.  I hope many others will find it as
useful as I have.

        The elimination process for chemicals occured as follows:        
                
        (1) Any chemicals that are commonly known to the public were 
        eliminated.  Examples are 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT),
        1,2,3-Propanetriol trinitrate (nitroglycerin), and 
        cellulose hexanitrate (guncotton).

        (2) Any chemicals that were listed or described in any other file
        i have seen were eliminated.  Examples are ammonium tri-iodide,
        acetone peroxide, and mercury fulminate.  I gave the picric acid
        salts, and a few other explosives, an exception to this rule
        because I think they are important explosives.

        (3) The chemical has to be explosive by itself, not a redox or other
        type of reaction (e.g. dust/particle explosion, or gas/combustible
        explosion).  This eliminated chemicals such as potassium
        permanganate.  I gave the chemicals ethyl ether, and isopropyl ether
        an exception to this rule as they form an unknown explosive peroxide
        readily that conforms to all other rules.

        Any compounds that passed the three processes are included in this
        file.  I regret any N/A's (not available) and will try to find
        the missing information in the future.

Entry: 1

Name:                   Acetyl Nitrate
IUPAC Name:             Acetic acid anhydride with nitric acid
Condensed Formula:      C2H3NO4 / CH3COONO2
Physical Properties:    Fuming, colorless, hygroscopic liquid. bp 22 c.
Explosive Properties:   Should be stored in a solution of P2O5 to stabilize
                        it.  Always explodes when heated above 60 c or comes
                        into contact with HgO.  Explosions have also occured
                        with ground glass surfaces.
Manufacture:            Preparation from acetic anhydride and N2O5.
Use:                    In nitrations to introduce a single nitro group in
                        an ortho position on an aromatic ring.
Toxicity (if known):    Irritant, corrosive.

% DISCLAIMER %

This article is concerning a study and field test of the reliability of
Thunderbyte's anti-virus package. The study was conducted by Rock Steady,
and this is simply a report about his extensive study of Thunderbyte's
TBClean utility. This report is not intended to scare people away from
Thunderbyte's anti-virus package, but rather to show you how TBClean
actually works in order to clean a virus. The information here may disturb
many people, nevertheless it is presented here for the safety of those who
use Thunderbyte's TBClean in a home and/or business environment.


% What is ThunderByte %

Thunderbyte is an anti-virus package, sometimes known as TBAV for ThunderByte
Anti-Virus. TBAV tries to use fairly new techniques to try to detect and clean
computer viruses. In this issue of the NuKE InfoJournal, we will take a
very close look at the structure of TBAV, mainly the utility TBCLEAN.EXE
which is supplied in every TBAV package.

TBCLEAN.EXE is a program that tries to remove viruses from your infected
files by using an heuristic/emulation approach. Now, for those who don't
understand what an heuristic/emulation approach is let me try to explain
it to you in more simplified, less-technical terms.

TBClean will try to set up a "control" environment to execute the virus. You
see, many of the computer viruses today will attach themselves to binary files
and alter them in such a way that when you try to execute (run) the binary
file the virus will execute first and install itself into memory, and then
the virus will execute the original binary file it is attached to. Now, every
????????.COM and ????????.EXE binary file contains an entry point. This is the
point from which DOS to starts to execute the code. Basically it is
the beginning of the program, and in order for the file to run properly we
need to start at that entry point. Now *.COM files contain a FIXED entry point
which is location 100h. Now if we attach a virus to the end of the COM file,
we have to fix the entry point so that when executed the virus will run
first. Since this is a FIXED entry point, we will go to location 100h, and
put a JMP statement to jump to the entry point of the virus. For the
original file to execute correctly, we will need the original three bytes
at the entry point, since the JMP we put for it to jump to the virus entry
point took three bytes of data in the .COM. So when the virus gives control
back to the file, we then must restore the original three bytes and execute
them.

Now to remove the virus from the .COM file we need to know where the original
three bytes are. So TBClean will actually execute the virus and try to catch
the virus restoring the original three bytes. Once that happens, TBClean can
safely remove the virus from the file, as it now can replace the original
three bytes where the virus put its jump statement.

Now .EXEs have a variable entry point, rather than a fixed one like the .COM
files.  Each .EXE file contains a header of about 32 bytes in the beginning
of the file which has information about the .EXE itself, including the entry
point. Now when a virus attaches (infects) itself to an .EXE file, it simply
puts its entry point inside the .EXE header and saves the original one for
later use.

Again, in order to remove a file from an .EXE file, we will need to have the
original entry point location. And TBClean does this by executing the virus
in a controlled environment; when the virus restores control back to the
.EXE file, it will jump to the entry point location. TBClean will halt
at that point and attempt to clean the file.


% The Problem %

The problem when doing this, the virus can always escape from this controlled
environment and go loose. In fact we at NuKE have attempted and succeeded in
doing just that!


% Explanation %

When you run TBClean to disinfect a virus-infected file, it does several
things in order to set up the environment needed to execute the virus. One of
things that TBClean does is check to see if it is being debugged.

I guess the makers of TBClean did not want people to "debug" their software
in order to have a closer look because once you know how the program works
you then can attempt to bypass it. The easiest way to bypass the anti-debug
traps is to use a debugger package that can go TSR and put loose breakpoints.
I've found that Periscope and SoftIce can easily bypass the TBClean traps,
or you may set a TSR file and set it to go off on the first interrupt 21h,
function 3Dh (DOS Open File).

The next main trick TBClean does is that it occupies all of the remaining
memory left in the system. TBClean only requires about 20k for itself, but
nevertheless it will occupy all the remaining memory left in the system. It
will use this memory for the file it will attempt to clean, but not all of the
memory is really needed, nevertheless it is occupied. Why? Well, because
TBClean wants to set-up a secure environment to run the virus and by occupying
all the available memory if the virus gets out of hand it CAN'T go resident
because there is no more memory left! "Pretty smart," you must be saying to
yourself? Yes, it is a good idea to occupy all of the memory, so like even if
the virus tries to allocate memory it will get an error and it will quit.

The next trick, before TBClean actually executes the virus in the controlled
environment is that it will make two copies of the interrupt vector table.
This too is a good idea, because if a virus does manage to escape and hook the
vector table, TBClean will notice the vector table change and restore it
with the original value. Therefore, if a virus was to "get out" of this
controlled TBClean environment we would need to hook all three copies of the
vector tables (DOS + the two copies that TBClean makes).

After this, we are pretty much ready to try to make a disinfection via
emulation. Of course TBClean turns on the Trap flag, and uses Int 0h, 1h, 3h,
and 4h to do the actual tracing. The interrupt that we REALLY need to pay
attention to is Int 1h. Why? Well, when Intel built the first 80x86 (the 8086)
they added what we call a Trap Flag. Normally this flag is off, and the
processor executes every line of code without stoping. But when the trap flag
is on, the processor will issue an Int 1h call after every line of code
executed. Therefore, after every line of code is executed the processor will
issue an Int 1h, which TBClean quietly awaits -- then it can actually analyze
the code line by line.

There are a few restrictions that TBClean enforces; one of them is the Trap
flag must always be on! If you try to turn off the Trap flag, TBClean will
fool the virus into thinking the Trap flag is off, but it really stays on.
Secondly, interrupt calls are not allowed. Thirdly, it will never give you
the true vector address of Int 1h or Int 3h -- it gives you a fake value
instead. Finally, TBClean will NOT allow the virus to have its segment in
the DS or ES registers, meaning that if TBClean resided in location 0ABC:0000,
the value 0ABC is never allowed to go in the DS or ES registers of the virus.
This is done so the virus is not able to snoop inside TBClean.


% Making a virus to bypass TBClean %

After I had successfully taken apart TBClean, and once I understood exactly
how it worked, then I was ready to write a virus to defeat TBClean's
dangerous emulation techniques.

Don't get me wrong, TBClean has a great idea going, but it contains too many
flaws that must be tightened up. And apparently those flaws can lead to the
destruction of your PC. Just think about it. Let's say you just downloaded a
file from your local BBS, and you used TBSCAN to scan the new file for viruses,
before you attempt to execute it. Lets say the file is infected with a virus
like Varicella-][, which can bypass TBClean. Now if TBSCAN reported a virus,
wouldn't you naturally try to clean it so you could perhaps use the file? Of
course you would, and what program would you use to do the job? Nothing but
TBClean!

Picture it, your computer is not infected by any virus, you are pretty much
happy about yourself for using TBSCAN and detecting that virus inside that
file you just downloaded. Your glad you got it before it infected your
computer. Or lets say you got TBScanX resident, and it caught the virus, just
as you attempt to executed it... You now try to clean the file with TBClean.
TBClean does what it has to do, looks at the file and then tries emulation to
disinfect it. After emulation TBClean reports no viruses found, and tells you
that it may not even be infected with a virus.

You're puzzled? Well, actually TBClean just unleased the virus into your
system! Now who's to blame? Personally, I think it's the incompetent
programmers of TBClean. It allowed too many loopholes in their program, and
the Varicella-][ virus just took advantage of those loopholes and is now
resident in your computer, ready to infect every file you touch. Remember, it
is also a very fast, stealthy virus.

Personally, if _any_ anti-virus program should attempt to disinfect via
emulation, it must be EXTREMELY cautious, and it should take every
possible loophole into account. Remember, emulation means that you are
actually executing the virus in order to disinfect it. Many people didn't
know that, but TBClean executes (RUNS) the virus! How Satanic! Thunderbyte
should praise NuKE for testing their software and showing them their flaws, so
that they may do whatever is necessary to fix this problem.

It is fortunate for Thunderbyte that no "evil" virus writer has noticed
this problem and took advantage of it. It would have cost Thunderbyte
their name and market share.

Anyhow, enough with Thunderbyte, this package has enough flaws. It is sad
that Thunderbyte rated very low under NuKE's personal attack tests in several
fields.

Thunderbyte reported too many false positives, meaning it screamed *VIRUS*
when no virus was present. It is enough that the average computer user is
paranoid about viruses, but if you "cry wolf" too many times people lose hope
in the package.

Thunderbyte was incapable of working in a DOS Window shell, in SCO Unix, and
under OS/2. This seems to be because TBSCAN uses its own file routines, instead
of DOS's.

Thunderbyte is also not very user friendly -- 4 out of 5 moms found this
package too difficult to use. A Windows version of Thunderbyte could
be a great plus.


% And in this corner...Varicella-][ %

Let's go into detail with parts of the Varicella-][ virus and let's show you why
it works.

     1          mov     byte ptr cs:[tb_here][bp],00h   ;Reset TB flag
     2          xor     dx,dx                           ;dx=0
     3          mov     ds,dx                           ;ds=0
     4          mov     ax,word ptr ds:[0006h]          ;ax=0000:0006 segment of
     5          dec     ax
     6          mov     ds,ax

Okay, after looking at the above we begin by resetting our TB flag. TBClean
will not give us the complete address of Int 1h. It will only give us the
correct segment, the offset is no good. Therefore let's simply take the segment.
Now we know the segment location of TBClean in memory, since TBClean will
not let me store the value in DS, let's subtract 1 and *then* store it in DS.
We have again fooled TBClean; maybe we can't have TBClean's correct segment
in DS, but by subtracting 1 and adding 16 to IP, we get the exact location.

In the next block of code, we will search 64k of TBClean's memory in order to
find the Int 1h and 3h offsets and the two copies of the vector table. This is
the bit of data we will be searching for.

[This is the tricky part! Remember TBClean occupies ALL available memory!
 So I had to come up with a routine that would work when TBClean was NOT in
 memory, and when it was! The task was hard...but I did it (naturally, hehe).

 TBClean *NOT* in memory: If TBClean is not in memory, then we start at location
 "install_virus" and we get the List of Lists, and we get the FIRST MCB chain
 and basically we chain through until we find the END of the MCB chain, which
 ends with a "Z" instead of an "M". Once we find the last chain we subtract
 the virus size in paragraphs, and that's it...

 TBClean in memory: If TBClean is in memory when the virus finds the LAST
 MCB block and tries to subtract its size from it, it will notice that
 not enough memory is available. Where then will jump to "steal_some."

 What "steal_some" does is it will REPEAT the process again. Meaning it will
 now get the FIRST MCB chain, and chain through the end, but while its chaining
 through the MCB, it will look for the MCB that belongs to TBClean!!! Once we
 find the MCB that belongs to TBClean we will subtract the virus size in
 paragraphs from it and voila -- we stole and allocated memory while bypassing
 TBClean!!! And now we can safely return to TBClean without worrying if it will
 de-allocate our memory space.]

% Varicella-][ Virus Eats Up Thunderbyte's TBClean %

This is the complete virus source code for the Varcella-][ virus that can
bypass TBClean v6.04. This virus is for research only. It is a very advanced
stealth virus -- it can disinfect on the fly and hide its length quite well.

If you have any feedback, please write to me about it on your closest NuKENet
BBS. I'm glad to be of any help. Or if you wish for NuKE to test any other
anti-virus package, please tell us. The InfoJournals are for you.

% CARO's Meeting Agenda %

By now, most of us have seen this particular document and have
either accepted it as factual or shrugged it off as a hoax.
Regardless of your viewpoint, there are still a few items of
interest, and their implications, that I wanted to address. 
Initially, I wanted to do this wonderful spill on the legal
aspects of cartels and collusion, but since this particular item
cannot be substantiated as being 100% legitimate, I prefer to
avoid any possible legal responses that may be incurred by doing
so.  I will therefore attempt to define some of the more relevant
issues and let you be the judge.

The New American Dictionary defines the CARTEL as:
"A monopolistic combination of independent business enterprises."

The same dictionary defines COLLUSION as:
"A secret agreement for a deceitful or fraudulent purpose."

Let's first look at a few statements from this "alleged" agenda.

3.   Membership categories - I'd like to formally propose three
     categories  - weeders, disassemblers, and advisory. 
     Advisories don't want, or get, the viruses. Disassemblers
     have to do CARObase entries.  For weeders, see below. It
     means we modify Vcircle, and we don't give the password to
     the advisories (e.g. Yisrael R. , Ken van Wyck, etc..)


The third motion in this agenda makes reference to the word
"MEMBERSHIP."  Although this does yet imply any businesses or
transactions, we can safely assume that CARO is indeed a
structured organization.


4.    Consideration of new applicants.
     - John Buchanan asked me if he could join. He hasn't         
       formally applied, though.
     - I'd like to suggest Sara Gordon
     - Iolo Davidson ( worked at S&S for a few years, has my      
       collection, author of Virus Guard, does disasms )
     - Steve Hill (something might have gone wrong with the vote, 
       as there is no record of no votes, according to Chris      
       Fischer)
      - Any others

In item 4. we can now assume my claim of CARO being a
"STRUCTURED" organizations correct due to the reference of
"FORMALLY APPLIED."


7.   Proposed action against organised virus writing groups -
     working group to be formed, I suggest, with 2/3 US members
     (Glenn, Joe, Ross?), 1/2 Euros. It's mostly a US problem,
     now that ARCV have gone :-).  

     We should set up a Murky Database (Handles, BBSes, Names,
     Addresses.)  The objective is to get a police prosecution
     against anyone who is committing a crime (but not, of 
     course, against anyone who is not committing a crime)


In line seven, we may be able to link "BUSINESS" into the picture
if the people mentioned, Glenn, Joe, and Ross, are the same
people as those we know as Glenn Jordan of DATAWATCH (Virex PC),
Joe Wells of SYMANTEC, and Ross Greenburg, author of FLU-SHOT.  
If such is the case, then we have representatives of a common
field, uniting efforts for a common cause. There is nothing
illegal here and it is not implied that there is anything illegal
with what they may be doing.


8.   Identification and naming - if Frisk isn't there, that'll
     have to be deferred. But maybe Vess and I can do some stuff.

In line eight, we have yet another reference to a person who
could quite possibly be Fridrik Skulason, author of F-PROT.


     11.4 An undertaking from those who want to participate. The 
          disadvantages are that you get to do lots of work, and
          everyone benefits. Your company might not permit this. 
          I suggest we call these CARO members the Weeders.
          Non-weeders don't get the garbage files (why would you
          want them? ), and get the viruses slightly after the
          weeders do.


In line eleven, subsection four, we can see a reference made to
the word "COMPANY."  This seems to substantiate the claim that
the actual companies are involved with the CARO organization.  

We can clearly see that the some members of CARO do work for
companies that may, in the long run, benefit from the efforts of
this organization's findings.  I am concerned that CARO might
possibly become a cartel.  Membership in CARO is restrictive in
nature, which conceivably keep other companies with software
ideas from joining and sharing the same benefits.  Essentially,
this situation could be construed as a barrier to entry under
ideal conditions.  If CARO can manage to encompass all of the
"select" companies, then quite possibly CARO may gain a
monopolistic control over the market. Although there
is one organization that presently holds the majority in market
share, the possibility for a combined effort producing a new
technology exists.  All of us know that this one person must soon
adopt a new method of detection and eradication or his product
produce will quickly become too cumbersome for any practical
use. You think about all the possibilities! 

Moving right along... Let's look at the second definition that I
mentioned earlier in this text.  Collusion!

According to the dictionary definition of the word, collusion
does not always have to imply "illegal" activities, only
deceitful or fraudulent.  With this in mind, take a look at some
of the following excerpts from the "alleged" CARO agenda.


12.  The CARO Virus Collection. I think that it is really
     important that there be no such thing. That way, if people
     ask for it, or claim they have it, then it's nonsense. Can
     we so move - there is no such thing ?


This is self explanatory, but what is all this tripe in the new
set of statements?


5.   CARO Base 
     We need to come to a conclusion. Maybe the weeders (see
     below) are excused from CARO basing, on the basis that they
     are contributing as weeders ? That also gets Vess off that
     hook.


Okay! So there is a CARO base!


6.   Virus Tagging
     We have a leak somewhere. I'd like to find it, and stop it. 
     So we need to tag the viruses - that's easier than it
     sounds, these days.  Lets decide how.


The "BASE" is obviously a "VIRUS" base!


11.  Sharing the work on collections. I'd like to propose that
     for future collections like Stang's collection, or
     Buchanan's where the main problem is sorting the wheat from
     the chaff, that we divide the work up. You should be
     prepared to:

     11.1 Sort out the viruses from the non-viruses (that's the
          main workload)
     11.2 Isolate the non-viruses (put them in Zip files, marked
          Intended, Innocent and Garbage)
     11.3 Make a replicant of the viruses into a group of Goat
          files (I am willing to donate my little files [ big
          deal]) so that we all have N replicant and the
          original. And a small descriptive text file of the 
          basic info, which is (roughly how it infects, roughly
          what it infects, is it encrypted, is it stealth, is it
          polymorphic).  This is preliminary info, which you'll
          get as a result of replicating the viruses without
          doing any real work. Put this text file, plus the
          replicants, in a Zip, and if we all do some of the
          collection, many hands make light work.  Since the work
          is proportional to the number of files I suggest that
          we divide it on that basis.
     
          If N people volunteer to be weeders, each one will get
          1/N of the files in the collection. This idea only
          applies to collections that are large and likely to be
          weedful, and I think we should expect more such in
          future.

     11.4 An undertaking from those who want to participate.  The
          disadvantages are that you get to do lots of work, and
          everyone benefits. Your company might not permit this. 
          I suggest we call these CARO members the Weeders.
          Non-weeders don't get the garbage files (why would you
          want them? ), and get the viruses slightly after the
          weeders do.

     11.5 Someone to act as a central  coordinator/ collator/
          disseminator.  Vess is the obvious candidate, but he
          might have too much on already.


Again, we're back to square one!  Someone is going to now say
that the CARO Virus Collection doesn't exist, or at least make a
motion to this effect.


12.  The CARO Virus Collection. I think that it is really
     important that there be no such thing. That way, if people
     ask for it, or claim they have it, then it's nonsense. Can 
     we so move - there is no such thing ?


14.   Dinner. Beer. More beer.


...and last but not least, the last line of the "alleged" CARO
agenda.  Having read this article time and time again, I am
convinced that they must have done line fourteen for at least
three days prior to ever discussing line one.

You decide for yourself what these people are doing. I only
wanted to take the opportunity to show it to you the way I see...
Of course, I could be wrong, but as I see it, CARO may be able to
monopolize the industry if they control the mass collection and
can manage to restrict it from those whom the may not "approve."
Couple this with legislation in their favor and the general public
will be in for quite a shock. I dare say we would see any "free"
software any longer. Who works for free? How many people can you
count on one hand that are trying to do something for YOU?
                                                          
Special thanks to Time Lord of Phalcon/SKISM for snatching the agenda
at the New York conference!

7.   Proposed action against organised virus writing groups -
     working group to be formed, I suggest, with 2/3 US members
     (Glenn, Joe, Ross?), 1/2 Euros. It's mostly a US problem,
     now that ARCV have gone :-).  

     We should set up a Murky Database (Handles, BBSes, Names,
     Addresses.)  The objective is to get a police prosecution
     against anyone who is committing a crime (but not, of 
     course, against anyone who is not committing a crime)


I've read this paragraph several times over, and I just cannot believe the
filth in it. This above paragraph is certainly illegal, according to Canadian
and American law. This above paragraph goes against the Privacy Act.

I've looked at American, Canadian, English and Australian law concerning 
about the Privacy Act(s). In Quebec (a province of Canada) we have adopted
Law 68 this spring. The law restricts/forbids the sale of lists, that
private companies have collected and stored. It gives Quebecers the right
to see information about them, that private companies have collected and 
stored. It also reserves the right to database compilation lists to 
governmental agencies ONLY!

However, CARO does not have any right whatsoever to create a database
to begin with, because it has no relation to those on the database. A 
magazine company can have the right to create a database on its 
subscribers, as it is needed to send out their product. CARO's database is
not composed of their clientele, it has no relation to those on its database.
CARO is acting like a law-abiding body, which it IS NOT. CARO intends to 
compile a database of those "committing" a crime! 

ONLY, and I repeat, ONLY government agencies can compile a list of
"criminals." But those on that list have been formally charged and tried
in a court of law. These government agencies have the right to say that
those on the list are criminals. But CARO is not a government agency,
it does not hold the power of jurisdiction on anyone or anywhere! CARO
can be charged for a conspiracy simply be compiling this list! 

One has to understand that organized _virus_ groups, such as NuKE, are
rightfully legal. The law does not restrict the production of viral 
code, the law CAN NEVER restrict the production of viral code, it would simply
be UNCONSTITUTIONAL if such a law were made. It's plain dumb, and we at NuKE
laugh at those like CARO, out to create such ridiculous law(s). One
also has to understand that _no_one_ can restrict what an individual does
in his/her personal computer. As long as it is in the privacy of their own 
personal computer, and it does not affect anyone _directly_, you can do 
whatever pleases thy soul.

And if people wish to share amongst themselves any new viral code, they can! 
See, if the two parties agree in sharing viral code, no law has been broken.
Those that call a NuKE BBS (such as Cybernetic Violence) and request
virus base access are granted access upon validation. This too is legal!
Once you answer "yes" to the question of viral access, you have taken upon
the responsibility of receiving any virus. See both parties agreed on sharing
viral code, therefore neither of the parties were malinformed about the
viral sharing, and it does not affect anyone directly! Therefore this act 
is legal according to law. 

When is the law broken? Within NuKE this doesn't seem to occur, but lets look
at CARO, shall we...

Gathering information like a person's true name and address is enough for
CARO to break the law. People have a right to privacy, and once that right
has been taken away by some dimwit at CARO, once your right to privacy has
been raped from you, you can file suit for damages. In this situation, both
parties, (CARO and the person on the CARO list) did _not_ come to any
agreement what so ever, to be included in such a list. Also the CARO's list
implies that those on this list are law-breakers, criminals, bottom-of-the-food
-chain fungus. This is a great basis for suing for damages. You also have to
understand that CARO is NOT a governing body! Therefore CARO has _no right_ to
judge who is a criminal and who is not a criminal, as it does not hold the
power of the law. Therefore CARO can _never_ compile a list of virus writers
to be submitted for prosecution under legal boundaries.

The _fact_ of this database is so controversial, that we very well can see
a conspiracy in the making here. How is that? Well, HOW exact is this 
database that CARO is compiling, what methods are they using to collect
this information? Are they trying to bond an Alias to a body? If CARO
has reason to believe that "Rock Steady" is the blame for some criminal
acts, who is to blame? Are we going to _presume_ that Joseph Greco is
Rock Steady? What are the implications of this, if it were true? Does Joseph
Greco contain any legal documents that tie him to the name Rock Steady? How
are you going to prove this? Also, how clear is he tied to the crime? Is the
crime the result of a computer virus created by Rock Steady? If that is the
case then for every murder resulting from a gun we should charge the
manufacturer of the gun, too! Oh how moronic, only someone belonging to CARO
could come up with such a rule.

I can scream out all day that Joseph Greco is Rock Steady, it still is not
valid in court. Information like that is invalid because it can be easily
replicated by anyone, it is not authentic like a signature or handwriting
style. But what is needed to get a prosecution is _not_ the fact that Joseph
Greco used the name Rock Steady, or the fact that Joseph Greco IS Rock Steady
for that fact, but that Joseph Greco was the one to commit the criminal act!
And it is _extremely_ difficult to proof that. Because you really need to be
110% sure that Joseph Greco committed the crime, and the only way to do that
is to convict him at the moment of the crime. Which is fairly impossible to do,
round the clock surveillance is required, which of course would require a
warrant.

The legal system is an amazing system at work, and all that is needed to 
throw out a charge is one doubt. The legal system has to prove that you
committed that criminal act, _without_ any reasonable doubt. I've raised
several reasonable doubts, and can continue throwing them at you till I
die. 

Statistic show that, of all computer criminal charges laid, only 25% (figures
were extracted from Statistic Canada, and relate to Canada computer crimes only)
have been found guilty. Of course we need to "trim" the figures to reflect 
virus and security related criminal acts. In turn less then 5% would be the 
result of virus and computer security acts. In 1991 operation Sundevil began
in the USA, which was conducted by the Secret Service; in turn, 50 arrests
were made, 200 computers and 50,000 diskettes were confiscated, and the
only charge to be brought to court was for the result of the E911 article
that was published in Phrack Magazine. In result the editor of the Phrack
magazine responsible for the article pleaded GUILTY, and yet found to be
not guilty as charges were dropped. 

Steve Jackson Games filed a suit against the Secret Service for the illegal
confiscation of their computers and the damages caused by the Secret Service.
The Secret Service in turn was found guilty, and Steve Jackson was awarded
US$100,000.00 in damages. Therefore in fact, operation Sundevil was perhaps
the biggest flop ever to be conducted by the Secret Service, which lasted a
complete year, where salaries were being paid for hundreds of men, and in
result thousands of dollars loss in legal fees and a charge against them
which cost US$100,000.00, and every penny of operation Sundevil was from
taxpayer's money. Hard earned money of every day taxpayers like you and me,
that busted their hump earning each penny.

We are being raped by technology-driven companies, such as closed-circuit
television and electronic access cards used to monitor workers in offices.
Personal communications devices, which are changing how we use a telephone,
would be assigned to people, not fixed locations; that would make it possible
for the phone company to know where the caller and recipient were when a call 
was made. These are security problems associated with cellular phones.

Hopefully one can understand where all this can possible lead to. We are 
entitled to data-protection rights! Personal information should be collected
only where warranted, and use of it and access to it should be subject
to tight controls. 

After reading this article, many of you might well be tempted to crawl into
your bed and pull the cover over your head. But that would be to succumb 
to the "technological trance." Instead all of us should become _more_
vigilant, and press harder for our rights.

August 1993


I typed up the following article entitled simply "Toll Fraud Device" from
the Summer 1993 (vol. 10, no. 2) issue of 2600 Magazine.  The article is
uncredited in 2600, so we're not quite sure who to thank...  Anyhow, since
we've done articles about red boxing in the past and have received tremendous
response, we thought our readers would like to see a great new optimized
design for a red box.  Enjoy!

                            Rock Steady/NuKE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


% Toll Fraud Device %

We at 2600 are often asked, "What is a toll fraud device?" Well, we decided
to answer the question once and for all. This red box is a toll fraud device.
Why is it a toll fraud device? Because any red box that can be built this
cheaply and this easily and can fit in the palm of your hand was clearly
_not_ made for demonstration purposes.

Okay, so what is a red box? Well... a red box is hacker slang for any device
that simulates payphone coin signalling tones in North American payphones.
Red boxes emit the precise tones used by payphones to tell the local switch
that the appropriate coinage has been inserted. The tones are played through
the mouthpiece in lieu of dropping coins into the payphone. This particular
red box is particularly fraudulent in that it only simulates quarter tones.
After all, when one commits toll fraud one does not want to waste time
pumping virtual nickels and dimes into the payphone when quarters work quite
nicely thank you.

For those of you who are technically minded, the theory behind the circuit is
easy enough to grasp. The DTMF encoder (U1) used in conjuction with the
crystal (X1) produces the desired frequencies. The decode counter (U2)
controls the cadence or how many frequency pulses are used. The 555 timer (U3)
used in conjunction with R1, R2, and C1 produces the actual pulses and controls
how fast they are delivered. The circuit is a good hack because it utilizes
the carry flag on U2 to overcome any stray charge on C1 that may cause the
first pulse from U3 to be inaccurate. It accomplishes this by ignoring the
first five pulses produced by U3, processing the next five, ignoring the
third, processing the fourth, ignoring the fifth, etc... The circuit is also
a good hack because it utilizes that well known coincidence in the DTMF
encoderm, the fact that substituting a 6.5 Mhz crystal for a colorburst
crystal (3.579545 Mhz) just happens to raise the "*" key frequencies from
941 and 1209 Hz to approximately 1708 and 2195 Hz. Since the desired
frequencies for a quarter tone are 1700 and 2200 Hz, the output of the
cicuit is well within tolerance. The cadence is determined by the RC
combination in U3. Each pulse lasts approximately 30ms, followed by 30ms
of silence.

So fraudulent is this red box that we at 2600 have nicknamed it the Quarter.
While all members of 2600 [and NuKE -RS] are morally righteous, and do not
advocate the use of red boxes for fraudulent purposes, we must admit that if
we ever did decide to commit toll fraud, we would trust nothing less than
a Quarter to do the job.

Obviously, the Quarter will not work with Customer Owned Coin Operated
(COCOT) payphones. You may also have some difficulty with newer
electronic payphones, as the phones companies are finally getting hip to
these little devices and are isolating the talk path from the receiver until
the call is established. Still, your Quarter should provide you with hours
of fun-filled listening entertainment. In a world where a one minute payphone
call from Washington DC to New York costs $2.20 (at the maximum discount rate
no less!) it will hardly surprise us at our suburban offices if, while sipping
ou afternoon tea, we happen to read about a sudden proliferation of Quarters
across the U.S.

As printed the circuit expects three triple 'A' batteries for a total of 4.5

470 kOhms instead of 440. Obviously, you will need a perfboard and chassis if
you expect to build the circuit.  Parts may be ordered from electronics firms.
Remember to order at least two of everything so that you will have spares in
case you mess up.

% To sara gordon Or Not To sara gordon, That Is The Question %

In a previous NuKE Informational Journal (#6), we had published an editorial
by Rock Steady concerning the "know-about" and experiences that Rock Steady
has encountered with Ms. Sara Gordon. To our surprise [yeah, right], Ms.
Gordon denied several statements we had written about her, so we at
NuKE asked Sara to write us a response pertaining to that article so we
could publish it in the upcoming InfoJournal.

What you are about to read is the actual letter Ms. Gordon send us, untouched
and unedited. The reason for this is so that Miss Gordon can comprehend that
we in NuKE have no intention to bad-mouth anyone, nor will we let our emotional
judgement cloud our writing. This "Information Journal" *is* factual hard-core
information, and nothing less.

I want you to read the following two captures. One is the reply from Ms.
Gordon. The second is a _private_ reply from Ms. Gordon to John Buchanan
(ARiSToTLE).

All sentences beginning with ">" are quotes from the original article in the
previous IJ. The rest are Ms. Gordon's comments (and her vivid imagination).
All sentences in brackets are comments by Rock Steady and NuKE.


% Capture #1 -- Sara Gordon's Official Reply to NuKE %

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
i've been sent your6 info journal (not by one of your own people this time),
and wanted to comment on something in it:
the comments are both to you and to the fellow who wrote these quotations:

>Get the picture? Yes, we all heard it before, I'm a deranged lair. The Anti-
>Virus community is _not_ maniacal to associate themselves with us. We all
>heard of Sara Gordon screaming out, `I never called an underground exchange
>board', she will never admit it. Nevertheless Sara Gordon holds the phone

i do not say i have never called an underground exchange board. why, in
our conversation last night i told you i -have- call them, to talk to the
sysops and virus authors. i have called on at least 10 of them (not many,
i know), that deal strictly with viruses. some in u.s.a., some not. i don't
upload viruses to them. i don't call them to 'spy' on what is going on there.
usually i call if i'm invited. i've talked about calling them in several
articles. why would you think i would deny this.

[10 times? 10 to what power? Don't upload viruses to them?! But you do upload
 viruses to the so-called AV, right? The AV is the cause of all the viruses
 out there, not us.]

and i don't scream. thats the radish's job. and, i use my real name when i
am the one calling. why, sometimes even other people call using my real
name :).

[You don't scream? Hmm, you sound calm enough -- I wondered what happened
 in the next capture!]

however, if by association, you mean, do i do the same things you do, the
answer is i do not; at least, i don't write and distribute computer viruses,
or hacking/phreaking/carding information.

[True, we don't harass people, or try to "double-dare" them to do vengeful
 acts for you. What's this now, you DON'T distribute computer viruses? Not
 even to the AV? Come on you know that _is_ a lie. Sara, we _don't_ suspect
 you of distributing viruses, we _KNOW_ you  do. It's been proven by our
 receiving of viruses... If you must lie, please make them more believable,
 put in some statistics in 'em sentences, at least it'll be partially right.]

>number of Cybernetic Violence, Black Axes, The Hell Pit, etc. Sara doesn't

of course i've called black axis. or it is axes now? and, i've talked to 
kato at the hell pit a few times. voice, even, after the ridiculous phrack
article. i think its been over a year now though since i've called him,
or he has called me.

[I know you have. I also know your "Dark Avenger article" was the best scam
 ever. ]<0oL YoU'r 0w N 0f s!]

ive never called cybernetic violence that i can remember, i think i -may-
have it in an overhead slide for a presentation, but i've not called it.

i told you this last night. 'holds the phone number of'...gee, so does the
phone company. and probably every law enforcement agency in the world.

[Gee, Sara, but you seem so damn proud to tell people that you hold the
 numbers...]

>associate herself with low-lives like ourselves, as she explains. Nevertheless
>she has CLAIMED to have called up The Hell Pit BBS, and uploaded 3 fake viruses
>and exclaims how easy it was to obtain virus access there. Now there's a 

wait. what exactly are you talking about here? can you please explain

[Oops, memory lapse!]

this? it -is- easy to obtain access there. and yes, three dummy viruses were
uploaded there to prove this point. it was a (very small) part of some
research data gathered to illustrate that the real problem of virus exchange
bbs was not the -viruses- but was the attitudes being presented and tossed
about. why, screaming radish, you agreed with me just last night on the 
phone (when you called me) that a lot of those people are putting out 
attitudes that -are- the problem.

[Our point exactly, and now your stealing our ideologies. You seem nice and
 calm in this message, but that is because you _know_ that this article
 was to be published, but what about articles you don't expect published?
 Are you this well-bred in them? I think not, as we reveal your private
 e-mail in the next capture.  BTW, any security flaws at the Hell Pit have
 been fixed long ago...there's no way she could get in now without a real
 virus.]

as far as not associating with what you call 'low lives like ourselves',
don't be silly. i never said i dont associate with anyone, i don't call
virus exchange bbs and upload computer viruses, because i think that once
i would let a virus out of my control, i would have done an irresponsible
thing.

[You didn't seem so distressed by helping to distribution of NED amongst
 the AV. Remember the AV _are not_ better than us. They are not above the
 law, and they don't have "better" morals then we do. They _think_ they
 do, but deep down its that money they wants. And they'll do whatever it
 takes to get it! Hmmm, capitalism, ain't it charm. Then you wonder why we
 wish to be anonymous, we have lives...]

i've never called anyone a low life that i can recall. you are that one who 
keeps using that term regarding yourself. i know only a small portion of your
lives, and wouldn't begin to judge you. i only say that certain actions
of virus writers are irresponsible; those actions i can judge because i've
seen the consequences of them

[You can't recall? Humms, memory lapse (again), common in elderly women,
 isn't it?]

>contradiction.  Now who are you going to believe?  Rock Steady, with a record for

>Man' to dinner was a figment of my imagination.  Also, the crap she said to me,

of course i associate with you.  why would you ever think i would say i
don't.  i did want to invite nowhere man to dinner.  why not?  ive had
dinner with far more proficient virus writers and hackers than him
:) seriously, why would you think i would be 'ashamed' of this?

[WAIT! Now you associate with me? This memory lapse thing is much more
 serious than I thought! A word of advice when lying, Sara, try sticking to
 ONE and ONLY ONE fabrication, don't start combining it with memory lapse
 and then other stories. Hell, why would you be ashamed of associating
 yourself with me. I _can't_ think of any reason!?! This associating
 think scares me, I think its time NuKE chips in and gets you a man,
 unless of course that isn't your preference! (No offence intended.)]

[Well, Sara, name those "more proficient virus writers" you've "eaten" (69?)
with.  Perhaps your sweetheart, Dark Avenger?  I can see it now, a bottle of
wine, some roses, that charming Slavic accent...head over heels I tell you.
See Rock, she is straight, after all!  BTW, I have never claimed to be a
hacker.  I am not a hacker, and I resent being associated with hacking, which
is an (wrongfully) illegal activity in most areas, whereas virus writing is
not -- and I don't support illegal activities.  I dunno, I bet her memory
problems is caused by some new virus from Bulgaria...a sexually transmitted
one. :-)  -NM]
 
i don't know what your problem is with me.  i run a free bbs to give out
information on viruses and security.  i write articles that bring the
positions of both sides into the public eye.

[You bring the positions of both sides? Right...]

im really quite tired of being quoted for things ive never said.  get
this straight--i do not find any problem with writing a computer virus.

[Uh-oh, that memory problem again...]

it's code.  what is the problem, at least as i see it, is the
irresponsible act of letting that code out of your control.  as i said
to SR, if you let people d/l viruses from your bbs, you are helping to
increase the problem.  you're helping to add to the already shaking
trust situation that exists out there.  well, since your last journal said
this is your goal, to eliminate every last piece of user trust in anti-virus
software (you specified frisk and mcafee, i think), i guess you are
accomplishing your goal.  congratulations.  personally, i think its
irresponsible, and not only that, you are helping some of the
anti virus product developers who do prey on the same fears to keep
right on taking advantage of the innocent users.

[So what are you going to do? Outlaw Viruses to "regular" people? And only
 AVers will be able to hold virus collections? That's almost like racism. What
 makes you better than us? We do this for the intellectual challenge, we don't
 seek money, we only teach those that wish to be taught! We also teach
 awareness, truth, reality. At least we agree about the anti-virus makers,
 making big bucks from this. But we can't bluntly make a law that is "racist,"
 you don't have to be from different ethnic groups to inflict racism you know.]

>of my vivid imagination.  Come on Sara, I heard it and you said it.  Of course,
>this is simply my word against yours.  Son of a gun Sara, didn't you hear all

>line Sara!  Someone, that kept on receiving calls, and therefore he/she had to
>switch and answer the call, via MaBells `Calling Waiting' service.

oh, you recorded the calls?  i don't have call waiting, and i don't care
if whoever listens to your calls listens to mine.  yes, of course i said
it.  and yes, of course i wanted to get in contact with talon (harry
mcbungus, terminator zed, et.al).  i talk to a lot of virus writers, and
hackers.  what makes you think i would deny this?  i would not deny this
any more than i have publicly stated the errors i made when i first got
involved in the fun world of computer viruses.  i've never tried to hide
any of this.  in fact, ive had it published, in major publications, as
well as conference proceedings.  why do you think i'd try to hide my
contact with anyone?

[Of course you don't hide from contacting virus writers, it gets you alot of
 coverage, humm 4 straight issues of VNI, nice. I'm quite sure you got those
 articles laminated in wood, right? But what _measures_ will you _seek_ to 
 endure in these contacts. That is the question at stake, Sara.]

>See I guess this isn't after all, just a figment of my imagination. Since I
>conference the call, my phone bill supports the fact that TWO calls were made
>at the same time from my number!  One was to the alleged person in the
>background while the other was yours!  (Sara)

must be.  i don't exactly understand what you are talking about, but i
guess you do.  i figured you were conferencing.  hope you paid for it.
by the way, why did you try to tell me you were talon?  your accent is
definitively from montreal.

[Don't understand? Instead of memory lapse, you now conclude that you don't
 have an adequate grasp of the English language? Nice One! Hope I _paid_
 for it?! You think I'd risk calling anyone up fraudantly? That's _illegal_
 Sara, I'm sure I got tons of officials "expecting" me to do just that so
 they may get rid of me for good. Uh-uh girl, I wouldn't give anybody a
 second in the day to catch me in any illegal activity.]

its pretty rude to allow other people to listen in to conversations;
most adults wouldn't do it.  do you think its just normal and acceptable
to do it?  i don't.  however, i would not have 'denied' any inviting of
virus writers to dinner or elsewhere even if you didn't have some
'proof'.  i've clearly stated, in publication (see this months personal
computer world u.k.)  that i talk with a LOT of virus writers.

[Pretty rude? It's my word against yours. This way I got someone backing me up
 on your side. Don't expect CARO membership just yet, girl.]

no one admitted in NuKe is a teenager?  better check those birth certificates...

[Lemme guess, its a _reading_ problem now? Flash me yours and I'll show you
 mine <wink, wink>.  Uh, birth certificates, I mean.]

it's not ever okay.

>The Virus problem has been solved, now what about the Anti-Virus Problem?

okay, so after our talk last night i had a few ideas i wanted to talk
about with you, but if -this- is the kind of thing you are going to
print, i think probably you don't want to hear what i have to say.  i
think it seems you would rather print things you imagine.

[Trust me, if -this- is your kind of attitude, take a walk sister. No fame
 coming to you from our direction...]

%  Capture #2 -- The Juicy Part %

In the following capture from Sara Gordon, who hot-bloodedly tried to
shoot NuKE down due to our gain of public support Ms. Gordon still likes
to imagine that NuKE is a bunch of hackers intent on viral destruction. This
is as spurious as you can get, NuKE is a publicly available organization.
Anyone is free to call up our systems and request access. We have nothing to
hide, all is open. We wish to communicate with the public to a great extent.
This also is an invitation for people in ALL walks of life who may speculate
about NuKE to simply call us up! I cannot talk on behalf of every NuKENet BBS
out there, as I cannot control them, but I can speak for myself, and I invite
anyone to call the World Headquarters of NuKE, Cybernetic Violence,
+1 514 426 9194. We feature a 14.4k v.32bis US-Robotics modem, and also have
Bluewave mail installed into our BBS so that you may download/upload all
messages without having to stay online reading messages. As we too understand
that time is costly over the phone lines...

 they are not open to the public. i don't imply it. i state it quite clearly.
 so, then you will be fwding the pertinent posts to the public? i bet.
 would you like me to do it for you? c'mon john. you don't expect me to believe
 that i will have access to those echos if i call you bbs? -all- of them? ok,
 lets see. you tell me i will, and ill call and check it out.

[Notice the different attitude expressed by Miss Gordon, when she _doesn't_
 expect anyone to be reading private Netmail! Notice the hot-blooded tone
 of voice. Notice how she double dares Mr Buchanan ("c'mon john"), insinuating
 that John is afraid to post it to the public that NuKENet is available to
 anyone, which it is! As long you support NuKE ideologies, and respect what
 people have to say, then NuKENet can be easily obtained for your BBS.
 Actually I _double dare_ Ms. Gordon to pick up NuKENet and make it
 publicly available to her users! I guarantee she won't "lower herself to
 our level"!]

 JB> Also, you state that they carry posts concerning PBXing and such. To
 JB> my knowledge and extent of control, they do not exist and should they

 you know they do. and you know that i know it. so lets stop playing around,
 at least have the decency to be honest about it.

[What a <CENSORED>! She will not stop screaming! In the past, we have plucked
 out any system on NuKENet that posts any illegal material, such as PBXs!
 (Just in case Miss Gordon wonders what "illegal material" means to us.) Today,
 we still stand on that same agreement and we are happy to report that no
 such posts has made itself known on NuKENet! Sara claims she has many,
 many people that capture messages from NuKENet and bring them to her.
 Yet she has NEVER had any real proof of her phoney statement. Let's just
 face it, Sara's a FAKE!]

 JB> when people in your position abuse the "language" of professionals

 oh please, if you make every effort to cut it off then why is it so blatantly
 still there, repeatedly? im not in any 'position'. im just a normal person
 who lives in the cyberspace, and who is sick of seeing it get all screwed up.

[Notice the attitude once more. She REFUSES to hear us out! We at NuKE under-
 stand, and have the dignity to respect any opinion Miss Gordon has to say,
 right or wrong, we have even published her reply to our previous NuKE IJ
 article, unedited! Yet, she refuses to hear us out, personally she seems to
 express a hatred towards us. And no matter what we do, Miss Gordon will
 always detest us. She complains that "virus writers" show utter hatred towards
 her. I guess they saw the _real_ Ms. Gordon, as we are witnessing in this
 private e-mail.]

i have researched what you say, john. and what you do. what you post is made
up in some cases. you want me to quote it for you? forget it. im finished
trying to help a bunch of people who want to destroy what is precious to me,
and to a lot of other people.

[No, Miss Gordon, it is _we_ whom have researched you. And not only did we not
 buy your first reply, according to the reply of NuKE IJ #6 article (that
 first reply was unbelievably bogus, as it didn't express _any_ of your 
 _real_ opinions, it only expressed the opinions you wanted the public to
 behold), nevertheless we see the true Miss Gordon here, don't we?]

if you want to talk about underlying motives of legislation, you are looking
in the wrong place, john. its the virus d00dz like nowhere man, and the rest
of the 'cute named guys (and gals) like 'pure energy', and that whole bunch
that brought this down on us. not any anti-virus 'cartel' or that other
nonsense you are talking about.

[And now she insults us!]

[Oh, I'm a "virus d00d" now Sara, eh?!  Is Dark Avenger a "virus d00d" too?
Or does that label apply only to men you don't sleep with?!  Are you trying
to imply at Pure Energy is a "gal?"  Well, I can assure you that he's not,
I've spoken with him many times, and I can assure that he is a male.  Uh oh,
maybe I shouldn't have said that, now she'll probably be after you P.E.! -NM]

JB> Soloman's lab... check them out for yourself, but daggone girl, y'all
JB> ask me to stop posting these little messages, how about a tiny bit of
JB> help in this area...

if its ok by me. c'mon john. you promised to send me you viruses a long
time ago so i could use them in my evaluations project. i've been working,
doing - real - work, all this time, while you have been setting up you nuke
the world, nuke this and nuke that. i doubt youd want the general public to
see what goes on there. im so sick of it and by it that i dont even read what
those guys send me from it any more. i dont know how you can look in the
mirror after some of the stunts you pull.

[No, no, no Miss Gordon, _personally_ we don't know how _you_ can look in the
 mirror after all theses stunts _you_ pull. You only fantasize about our stunts,
 please let them be publicly known, as we have let your stunts be publicly
 known. I'm afraid you can't do it, as we don't pull "stunts."  Only you Sara.]

ill check out anything you send me, but i don't believe you anymore. not for
a minute. if you were who you say you are, and were really concerned about
the cyberspace environment, you would not say some of the things you say,
creating more confusion, accusing good decent people of things that they
don't do.

[The only confusion here is your change of attitude, Miss Gordon.]

and by the way, 'infiltrate' is not -my- word. i didn't write it and the
editor has issued a -retraction-

["Infiltrate" not your style? Right, isn't that a requisite course for those
 associated with .mil (military)! Yes, I can see it now, this is truly a
 conspiracy in the making. Can't you governmental people do anything right?]

% An E-Z Guide to Remote UNIX Disk Mounting %

Remote disk mounting on UNIX systems requires root access on the base      
system.  The procedure is as follows:                                      
                                                                           
1. Create a temporary directory (/tmp/lame in this example).               
2. Query target with "showmount -e host.addr.addr".                        
                                                                           
     This will illuminate you as to which (if any) filesystems may be      
     mounted from your machine.  It will reply with:                       
                                                                           
           hostname:/directory/directory  -options                         
                                                                           
     where options are the mounting options (rw, ro), who may access       
     (host1:host2:...) and other sundry niceities.                         
                                                                           
     showmount -e hostname uses mountd on the remote to read the remote's  
     /etc/exports.                                                         
                                                                           
     If your machine is listed in the access field, or if access reads     
     "everyone," you may mount that filesystem.                            
                                                                           
3. Pick a filesystem you would like to mount.  Remember that you can       
   mount the subdierctories of the mountable directories.                  
                                                                           
4. Mount the filesystem.                                                   
     mount hostname:/filesystem/remote /tmp/lame                           
                                                                           
5. Do whatever you want with the filesystem.                               
                                                                           
6. Unmount the filesystem.                                                 
     umount /tmp/lame  OR  #umount hostname:/filesystem/remote             
                                                                           
REMEMBER:                                                                  
     - You must leave the directory you are unmounting.                    
     - ALL mounts (failed or successful) are noted in /etc/rmtab on        
       the remote system.  /etc/rmtab remains until purged.                
     - You must specify full pathnames when mounting and unmounting.       
                                                                           
MORE:                                                                      
     - An entry of "/filesystem/directory       " with no options in       
       a host's /etc/exports will allow world-mounting of that system.     
     - Remote mounting often uses RPC and NFS.  It will work most          
       often on Suns and workstations networked with Suns (ie: using NFS).
