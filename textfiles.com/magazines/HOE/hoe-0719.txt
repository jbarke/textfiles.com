 Subject:  wow, weirdness

        interesting, the pages you find when you do a search query about
 yourself out of the blue.

        http://www.nerdworld.com/trees/nw889.html

        why, may i ask, is my page listed on your website? it seems a little,
 umm, out of place.  okay, so i may not have the THICKEST hair of any girl,
 but being listed in the same column as a bunch of articles about balding is
 a little, shall we say, bizarre and a little disturbing.

 dammit that's weird, guys.

 --summer, aka phairgirl

 [-----]

        To date, I have received no replies.  I am still very disturbed.  In
 fact, I was very disturbed by a number of search queries for "phairgirl".
 Long-forgotten homepages of mine, long-forgotten webchat friends of mine,
 and foreign guestbooks.  Guess you could say I've been around the block.
