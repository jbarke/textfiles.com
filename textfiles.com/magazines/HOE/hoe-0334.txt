        Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, kids, let me try and set the stage for you.
 At some point during my modem LIFESTYLE, I became a buffer addict. I
 buffered a lot of stuff. 

        This period mainly dates from around 1993-1995, but there is
 stuff from either side in here.

        The first example here comes from a friend of mine, Daver, who
 has been all too kind with allowing me access to various things, when
 he knows that I intentionally get myself into all sorts of trouble. 

        However, this particular trouble wasn't even something I was
 looking for.  I posted a message to misc.writing, asking for
 information on the copyright laws, and some people freaked out. 

        See, my Real Name Field at the time was: "DJ ZYKLON B".

        Well anyway, here goes;

 Hello there...

 I would like to publically apologize for the behavior of a user here.
 He posted as squinky@tmok.res.wpi.edu, using an offensive name which
 you have have no doubt seen and which I will not repeat.

 The user has had his news access revoked and has been thoroughly
 reprimanded for his behavior. I would like to emphasize that this user
 in no way represents myself, TMoK Information Systems, or WPI.

 Obviously, certain people lack any type of common decency or respect.
 Alas, there really isn't much one can do about these type of people.

        Here's a little something I don't even remember, but I sure do
 like my ASCII American Flag signature, and this guy's response is pretty
 amusing.

        However, I would like to point out that I think Christ-baiting
 is pretty pathetic now. 

        At least I can evolve.

 Do you really hope to destroy this newsgroup by posting such tripe as
 this?  It seems that that is your intent.  I think that you want to
 suppress alt.christnet and eliminate any christian use of the net by
 making the net inhospitable to ANYONE who disagrees with DIVINE YOU!
 This is absolutely reprehensible.

 BTW, I think that any clergyman who misueses his influence to seduce
 little boys deserves to get the chair (electric, that is).  Certainly,
 he should be prevented from further contact with boys.  Such behavior is
 illegal in every state, and incidents should be prosecuted to the full
 extent of the law, provided that evidence truly exists (i.e., not
 manufactured by an ambitious prosecutor seeking to win a high=profile
 case for personal political gain).  Any denomination that shields a
 member of its clergy from the legal consequences of misbehavior is also
 engaging in behavior of the most dastardly type.  Forgivness does not
 mean that we condone or shield child molesters.

 Usual disclaimers apply.

        Hahahhaha.  You'll be seeing references to both a guy named
 Mike Labbe and his BBS, the Eagle's Nest a lot in this file, so here's
 a quick run down.  Mike Labbe was your prototypical BBS child molestor.
 He literally got caught, arrested, and convicted of molesting two boys.
 He never did any jail time and his BBS never went down.  We were great
 enemies.

        Um, more intro: I was banned from the 401 Fidonet for faking
 postings via a bug in the BlueWave remote mailer, which allowed you to
 go in and hexedit your Real Name field. I posted a bunch of messages
 from various RI Telecom Personalities asking one another for sexual
 favors, and of course, Mike Labbe begging for sex from small boys. 

        Then, about a year later, I found access to 323-chat somewhere,
 and since I was reading the 323-sysops section, I knew there was an
 election for net-president going on, so I nominated myself. 

        Here's the ensuing fun!

 I'm sure Jarret Kobak *was* banned from the 323 echoes, he does sound

    I could be healthier in the long run but I think there will be a
 very big mess to clean up when this is all over. Venting anger and
 feeling is great and healthy, but look what happened here.

    I care. And I am sure I am not alone on this. No one died and left
 me boss, but as long as I am the NEC and run the show when it comes to
 mail I will give all the input that I see is needed. If the current NC,
 Stan, isn't moderating the conference then I will step in and do so. I
 am not doing this for a power trip, but to bring back some order to this
 net.

    Of all people Bill, you have been part of this net even longer than
 I have and you have been on the outside for a long time. Now you want
 back in and to help it take shape, I'm glad. Throw all those gruges you
 have away and lets get this net moving in the right direction. Enough of
 the BS and let's get this net moving in a productive way.

 Well, he's banned on my board, period. The invitation was offered to
 him to come back pending some stipulations but he decided not to take it
 up and that's perhaps just as well. Otherwise, I believe I was at the
 meeting you are referring to and yes I believe it was voted that Kobek
 was to be banned from the local 323 areas. Of course this was a long
 while ago and others have been 'banned' from 323 as well and then
 allowed back in less time than Kobek has been silent. Jim Williams comes
 to mind in this regard.

 legitimate complaints here, then that's your loss.

     Grudges? You're not listening to the nice man, Ralph. What I said
 was this net has to cater to more than just a small circle of friends,
 to the exclusion of everyone else; that a network is only as secure as
 its weakest link, so unless everyone is reasonably happy, no one is safe.

 RO>Enough of the BS and let's get this net moving in a productive way.

     Then address the issues and stop pretending they don't exist,
 they'll go away if you play moderator and nag at people loud enough.

 This USED to be a SYSOP-ONLY area.  I recall, in the past, when sysops
 would come in here asking permission for their assistant- or co-sysops
 to read the area.

 It's obvious some people take more pleasure  in destroying anything and
 everything we have in 323 than in resolving issues and problems.  Looks
 like this echo is no longer "secure" and we can never again speak openly
 to each other about our SYSOP problems.  Shame.  This is what drives
 people to netmail instead of speaking here.

 You did right by stepping in.  I don't think you  can make this area
 secure again though, as long as we have this JERK in our midst.  I can
 understand why Stan just isn't bothering any longer.

 Well I hope that one day this area will be secure again. It would also
 be nice to see more people here too. We are a net of 40 nodes and there
 are about a handful of us that actively read and reply to the messages
 here. I can remember way back when, when this wasn't the case.

     Ralph, as a veteran of many fights with Bill, I have to say he's
 right. <grin>

     At first angry words may sound like attacks -- and trigger
 fight-or-flight danger juices -- but when we run out of good lines
 what's left is competing howls of frustration.

     You've emerged as an even-tempered plain speaker in all this, and
 it's been great to watch.

     It's up to whomever we've just elected as NC to take the lead
 now -- part Solomon, part Santa Claus -- in establishing a climate
 where the frustrations of each of us are heard, considered and addressed.

 Well, since I paid what I owed 323 for the nationals, THAT was the
 "stipulation" I had to fulfill in order to begin recieving the 323 echos
 on my system.. Since MY end of the bargin was done, 323 kept it's end of
 it.

 There is a major diffrence between Kobak and myself. KOBAK is
 excessivly (sp) annoying.. And hence, his banning.. I could not recieve
 the echos due to the ammount I owed (and LONG ago since paid, as you so
 conviently forgotten)..

 So, before you start compairing me to Kobak, you better get the facts
 straight..

 You're 100% right, Jim.  Yours was merely a financial problem while
 Kobek was banned for being a complete jerk in our echos.  Even after
 being given warnings he persisted, and finally was banned from all
 323 echos.  Apparently we made the right choice too, becuase as soon
 as he reappears he continues in his old ways.  Apparently he hasn't
 grown up any, nor has he learned from his past mistakes.

 He might grow up, if no one stops him before he has the chance.

 *** Quoting James Williams to Todd Rourke ***

 JW> So, before you start compairing me to Kobak, you better get the
 JW> facts straight..

 Jim! Temper temper! His name is Kobek, by the way... not that it really
 matters for the purposes of discussion but if you or I or anyone else
 is going to talk about someone, we should at least get the name right.

 I made no comparison between you and Kobek outside the fact that you
 were both banned by the network. From my perspective, banning is
 banning, and the factors involved with such are not overly important.
 If I recall, however, I do believe the lable of 'annoying' got tossed
 your way, too. Which is the worse crime? Some ill-tempered bogus LOCAL
 mail or stiffing the network cash for national mail and then
 distributing it to other nodes for nominal sums? Probably no difference
 as I see it... if pressed, I'd say you made the greater transgression.

 In any case, you were allowed back in a couple months time or so. Kobek
 has been on the outs for close to a year. I have no problems with having
 you back at all, but I feel if a case can be turned around for you in 2
 months, then surely a year of excommunication for Kobek certainly
 amounts to 'debt to society paid in full.'

 Let me qualify this by saying I am no great fan of Kobek's. He's not
 nearly as bad as many would tend to think, however. I am more concerned
 with the fairness issue here. If you feel you got a 'fair' deal in being
 allowed back in in that period of time, then surely a return from 12
 months in exile is just as fair if not more than fair.

 Well, even on the assumption that Jarret wasn't directly given access,

 Perhaps Net323 hasn't learned from the past either.
 Kobek persisted in being "a complete jerk" BECAUSE of the warnings, and
 BECAUSE he was banned. I am in no way condoning his actions,  they
 certainly fall under FIDO's idea of "excessively annoying." However,
 whether you like it or not you (and everyone else) are directly
 responsible for giving him what he sees as legitimate  cause for his
 actions, misguided as they may be.  He doesn't do it becuase he's got
 nothing better to do. He does it because he feels he has reason to.

 Tell you what, if Kobek had quietly slipped back into activity, posting
 as everyone else, I would not object.  But look how he "slips" back in?
 He immediately begings his annoying behavior.  Let's be honest here.
 Some people (whom I consider borderline myself) provoke him and think
 it's funny, but what about the other dozens of users who find him
 offensive? Should we all have to put up with his bull because someone
 enjoys using him as the scapegoat...the excuse to get everyone
 pissed-off?

 Go ahead, disagree, but as an intelligent adult, you know I'm right.  All
 he has to do is behave himself and he'd be welcome, but no, he goes out of
 his way to be annoying.  Who needs it?

 Title: Mud

 Don't get the wrong impression Todd. My temper was not flared, well,
 a little <g>..

 It only seemed that when you stated I was "banned", you failed to
 mention what the circumstances were, which are totally diffrent than
 Kobek (got it that time ;>) In a way, I was rather angry, but then I
 figured, yes, there was a time I was barred, and yes, I was in the
 wrong. I admitted it. Feeding those nodes mail that shouldn't have been
 getting them was a major mistake.

 However, you must understand when we did that, we at that time smelled
 a rat in the financial department. We held a meeting of the northern
 nodes (Ralph was even at that before moving from Pawtucket) and figured
 it all out on paper. It seemed to us at the time that the fee we were
 paying for echos were exceeding the actual phone costs. When pressed for
 the actual bills, the former treasurer produced them, and had we viewed
 them, it may have caused a very diffrent turn of events.. Yet, the only
 thing we saw was a pile of paperwork.. And thats where the
 misunderstanding came in..

 Eric's attitude at the time, though, leaves MUCH to be desired.. I
 learned alot about Eric over the years..

 Sure enough, a few months later, the treasurer took off with the money,
 and left everyone hanging out to dry.  I honestly felt badly that
 happened, but I was not suprised at the least. Unfortunatly everyone
 had to suffer..

 Mine was mearly a financial matter settled with 323 over a
 misunderstanding.. The matter was long ago settled. The transgresion of
 feeding those nodes was based on the information I and the other nodes
 had at the time.. If information was exchanged to us, that more than
 likely wouldn't have happened.

 Kobek, on the other hand, while I personally would not mind if he were
 reinstated if he showed any resemblance to improvment in the social area
 instead of trying to be an irritant (sp), still has, unfortunatly, not
 shown any sort of improvment at all.. I do not mind airing
 dissagreements, even to the point of anger being vented, however, as in
 the case in this echo for the past few weeks, it can get to the point
 where it can be destructive instead of constructive. If the critisizem
 (sp) stayed on the constructive level, then thats good.. It's when it
 turns ugly and the attacks turn personal, thats when it should be said,
 "enough".

 Kobek, however, even after about 2 years still behaves rather poorly..
 Anyways, I'm glad that this is all over with and maybe things can
 return to normal. (ya gotta admit, Eric Chew would have just LOVED
 this week! <grin>)

 Take care,

 I had to use those systems to read the bases before I became an official

 He's also ineligible.  One of the principal requirements of being

 Dear Squinky,  This is a letter that I have sent to your 
 system administrator.

 To whom it may concern:

 I have collected a (short yet representative) list of posts that 
 squinky@tmok.ids.net has posted to the newsgroup alt.rhode_island. 
 As you will see these posts are not only infantile and offending, but
 they have nothing to do with RI. My concern is that this behavior will
 discourage more mature readers to post intelligent things on this 
 newsgroup. If there is anyway you can relinquish this guy's newsgroup 
 priveredges or his net access, please do. 

 Thanks, Mike Tammaro
