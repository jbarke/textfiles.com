|
| The face of the on-line world is changing very rapidly.  Well, it's
| *always* been changing very rapidly, but I don't mean new technologies.
| I mean cultural inclusion. I was once a geek. I had my own email address
| long before it was trendy. I have an impressively low ICQ number. I once
| used Win 3.11 for PPP access. Yes. I was hardcore. I guess that's why
| the world today shocks me. I should've seen the impending reality when a
| trendy chick had a shirt with a URL on it. Hard to remember now a time
| when the web wasn't huge. I'm so unused to random people just using
| email. I still think of it internally as a geeky thing, but it's not.
| Not anymore. Internet access seems to be a staple of exsistence now.
| Only truly technologically illiterate people refuse to use it now. I
| suppose this is a change for a better, but I can't help feeling sorta
| violated. This was my domain! This was my culture! What are all these
| strangers doing here now? Why do people message me randomly on ICQ in
| languages I don't comprehend. Why has it become popular to use "u"
| for you and "r" for are as opposed to being laughable. Why has being a
| 1337 hax0r become COOL?!!? Where did my net go? *sniffle*
|
| The idea was sound from the beginning. Kill the old media convention of
| the few to the many. Let the many broadcast to the many, but I'm afraid
| the signal to noise ratio has gotten WAY out of hand. There's so much
| useless junk on the net now. So many useless people that have no
| bussiness invading my communication channels.  I am no longer a geek in
| my head. New technology doesn't interest me. Why did it ever? It was
| exciting. A new adventerous world was around me and I wanted to explore
| it, but the world has been painted over in corporate slogans and is home
| to bubbly teens. It's lost what made it magical. Now it's just another
| tool.
|
| The honeymoon is over.

| You guys really are a bunch of pathetic losers.  If someone told me that

| spent in utter waste?
| 
| I know the net is full of any old idiot who can put up whatever they want

 dear mogel, 

 I have a very, very, very big problem! I think, my boyfriend has a
 relationship with another girl and I think they know each other through
 the internet, so I really, really want to read his mails, because I'm
 sure, they mail to each other at work.  do you know a possibility to
 crack his hotmail password?  I'm really very despaired, because I also
 don't know the secret answer.

 please help me if you can!
 thank you!!!

 Subject: The End of HOE?

        Hey Mogel--I'm Kristen McGregor and I've never written to
 Hoe before.  Here's my article.  I want to be part of Hoe before it ends.
 I've read it for about four years now, just never gave you anything
 before.

 "One more year" by Kristen McGregor

 One more year today.  One more year of this shit.  I'm taking my
 car, Bonnie the '96 Ford Aspire, and gonna aspire my ass out of this
 craphole town.  I'm driving as fast as I can to someplace where I'll enjoy
 life.  I'll dye my hair some funky color, but probably I'll try a platinum
 blonde first, start wearing more than lip gloss, and go by a different
 name.  When I get to where I'm going I'll introduce myself as something
 totally different.  Something spiffy... Anastasia... Romaine.  That's it.
 Oh god! Do you know just how perfect that will be?

 I'm not exactly concerned if I go to University, either.  Have fun
 while you're young and then go to college!  Besides, school is a nightmare.
 I seriously doubt I learned anything there that I couldn't have learned on
 my own.  And to top it off, school is full of those full of it teachers
 who just expell their bullshit upon you.  Teachers, with exceptions, are
 just a buncha arrogant jerks who rely just a little too much on that
 degree they attained a long, long time ago.  They love to preach.

 "And YOU, young lady, lack the focus to go anywhere in life."

 Well, fuck that.  Nothing is going to bring me down.  Nothing!  Do you
 hear me?

 Making friends was and is the worst.  Under the constant ridicule
 of being a "crackhead" and trying to fit into the utter conformity of
 waify girls who just look like _The Gap_ sucked the life out of them and
 the little freaks that get some kicks out of becoming your friend and
 then pretending not to know you when you come back.  The whole school is
 knocked up with little rich shits and I somehow wound up in the middle
 of it.

 I'm thinking California.  A nice tan would do me wonders.  I'll make it.
 Life will be good, once I get away from here.  You'll see.

        A first and last contribution. What do you think?

			punk rock punk rock punk rock always punk rock but
 what about punk cock the smooth lithe dicks of all the punkers coming into
 those bonny holes of all their women and men and all the festering fistules
 of flesh bursting out their semen their lust their love their needs and
 doing it all over again the bounty of youth the flaws of ucking the endless
 machinations of sex punk cock up in the house and up in the mouth 

	cut little holes in her sides and put his dick in those holes
 feeling the total warmth and suction something no orifice could ever give
 something only this could do didn't mean to start it like this kidnapping
 and cutting but had to do it no matter and oh it was lovely tried to do it
 once a year once a year but now it was one every six months and in the
 future he could see it being once every 3 months and then? no don;'t think
 like that don't worry keep it tucked aweay and maybe it'll stay but god it
 feels god to have the dick in this flesh but god maybe i should start
 heating up and meat and fucking that i read portnoy's complaint he thought
 but he knew that the microwaving would strip the juices that the living
 tissue had so mabye he'd go to animals but he knew animals would scream in
 a way that living people would not

        so in the end it came down to the way it started a dick in a pussy
 feeling that and tongues in mouths and feeling that and bodies aainst one
 another and feeling that warmth love maybe but not really and all the
 beautiful things that came with the merging of the flesh parting the tides
 but god it was something he wanted and he got it and she seemed to dig it
 too and oh lord yes it was what he needed now more than anything here this
 sex doggy style missionary her on top venus butterfly him in a chair her
 standing yes it was all he needed and it helped a little here and there
 and sometimes life seemed a lot better with it and then other times when
 he thought about the literal mechanics of his action and the fluids and
 the flesh and the way of all bodies he was a little disgusted and looking
 down at her pussy it was something like roast beef on a grill he wondered
 how he could touch it with so many different parts of his body but she
 shifted her weight and her vagina's opening parted just a little and he
 could see deep into the darkness of her hole and he felt in his pants an
 erectoral rise going up faster than a strip mall and he smiled a bit and it
 into one of her breasts not hard enough to draw blood or break skin but
 hard enough to make her go errogenous zone insane and she spread her legs
 even more and down there was the hole practically begging him for the
 penetration it so sorely desired and he could hear its little voice saying
 do me do do do do, do me! and he knew he had to do do do do do do, do it!
 and he took his dick from out his pants and pulled his pants down but not
 all the way down just to his ankles and he stuck his dick inside the pussy
 and then it was oh so lovely he was burning but not enough to cause harm
 and he felt the pussy and the pussy was feeling him back and he knew that
 like duchamp he wanted to create art that gripped the mind like the vagina
 gripped the penis

 OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK!

 one thousand, one hundred, and eleven ascii screams've met my approval

 HATE to sound CORNY, fellas, 'cause there's always that kinda shit when
 a big bad thing is goin' down, and this here BIG BAD #3 is real, real, bad.
 in fact, there may never be anything worse.  ever.

 what's that to you?  I'll tell you this--beyond the cDc-rhetoric about
 text files being the ultimate preseved geek culture, and textfiles.com's
 speeches about socilological goobajooba, working with ascii has taught me
 just one thing, and I'll pass these words of wisdom off the dome:

 If you pick something to be creative and obsess about, even if only a
 handful of freaks like you get it, it'll teach you all you need to know.
 it may sound ridiculous, but in many indirect ways, writing text files has
 somehow put me places I may have never been at before.

 This ain't no testimonial.  Here's the value of text files: testing
 yourself.  Being creative.  Producing something simple, small, personal,
 with style.  Trying to make the raw arrangement of letters on a computer
 screen is the closest thing to geek honesty we'll ever have.

 Don't forget it.  Even while you're making your graphic-laced, interactive,
 direct-everything, active-everything, e-everything web designs--content--
 the message--is what all the real people are gonna see.  There are still
 plenty of us who do notice.  That's all I gotsta say.

 Let's proceed with the hundreds of text files about feces, nostalgia,
 computers, personal stories you don't care about... and death.

 DEATH by Uberfizzgig

        Death is good, but it has a fierce after-taste.  Be sure to pop an
 Altoid before you mosey off into that light or as the case will be for
 most of you, before you are dragged screaming into a lake of fire where
 your flesh will burn for eternity and you chew the feces of you mother.
 Actually, if you're in that last category, you may want more than just
 one mint.  And be sure to take them out of that metal can first, because
 it will get too hot to touch and maybe even fuse shut.  Then where will
 you be?  Also, if you are planning to serve death, instead of dying
 yourself, the proper wine varietal is Sangeovese for a normal death, or
 Chianti if the death you're serving is more gruesome.

 There are perhaps a dozen t-file groups that have been around as long as
 HoE, certainly none as prolific.  With the passing of each old school
 pillar of e-zines, the net is losing valuable insight into the minds of
 our society.  It's sad, but a majority of the Internet sheep don't even
 know about these zines, this raw pool of writing talent.  Their loss in
 not stumbling across them during their digital life.  Our loss when
 another chooses to close up shop.

 Date: Sat, 01 Jul 2000 15:51:45 CST
 From: Lobo@greeny.org
 To: mogel@hoe.nu

        I've never been part of HOE.  Of course, my name has popped up a
 few times in the past:  someone claiming to be me did a shitty interview
 in #80.  And I did write something awful that somehow DTO #3; that's the
 closest I ever got to being in HOE.

        Of course, I am the editor of one of HOE's "contemporary" (we're
 actually a year older than HOE; suck on that, ya sonofabitch!) e-zines,
 GwD, so I have an interesting perspective on all of you HOEs out there.
 For instance, there's the idea that HOE has stolen its look and feel (at
 least its feel) from  GwD.  Sure, you guys are at issue #1000-something
 and we haven't even passed the century mark yet, but that's not the point.
 That proves that we REALLY DO put out the lamest, crappiest publication
 ever, and you guys are just pretenders to the throne.

        That's okay, though; you've still earned my respect, even though
 you did re-publish cDc #001 (Gerbil Feed Bomb) without permission.

        My experience with a hoe:  I used to work at a movie theater, and
 we were required to hoe the weeds behind the building while wearing a
 shirt, tie, and dress shoes.  I had hoed everyday for a week, and the
 manager told me to hoe them again.  I told him I'd shove that hoe up his
 ass.  Now, he could have fired me on the spot, but he laughed and made the
 stoner chick who was working with me hoe the weeds instead.  This, of
 course, shows that I rock balls.

        There's something I'd like to point out:  in HOE #1 ("The Entropic
 Theme Song" or something like that), it claims that "entropy" rhymes with
 "anarchy."  This is most certainly not true.  Look up rhymes in the
 dictionary, numbnuts.  As such, you must be destroyed.

        Now that HOE is calling it quits, GwD holds the undisputed title of
 crappiest publication in the e-zine world.  Thanks.  You guys have given me
 the desire to actually get off my ass and mess with GwD-stuff.  Since
 you're quitting, there's no other publication/group still around from the
 mid-1990s.  Damn you, you've made me want to work on text again.

 Fucking assholes.  Reap the whirlwind, chaches.  You've brought down the
 thunder, well now you've got it.

 To: mogel@hoe.nu

        Well Mogel, it's sad to see it end.  I remember reading HOE off of
 the BBSes in 1995 and thinking that zines were the ultimate form of
 independent self-expression.  I still believe in that, of course, as is
 evidenced by the e-mag that I have working on for the last few years.
 Don't worry my man, the zine world will live on and will always be seen
 as a better place for having HOE as one of its highlights.

        I remember feeling sad the first time HOE ended, and that was
 because I was a lost teenager reading the immortal words of what other
 teenagers had to say about life, love, and angst.  This time, though,
 things are different.  HOE isn't a teen zine anymore.  It is something
 more.  We have watched it grow and change with time, going through life
 at the same rate that we have.

        It is a zine that has shared some excellent literature with the
 world while at the same time dishing out barrows full of smut.  I love
 that.  There is something special about a zine that is humble enough to
 openly criticize its own material.  Sure Mad magazine does it, too, but
 Mad magazine doesn't take it all the way by using 1k IRC logs as entire
 issues.  HOE has always kept it real in that way, ever since the ping
 pong bombs and the completely accurate and yes IMMORTAL Violent Femmes
 lyrics that always keep us bouncing in our bed from house to house.

        The issues have always been good, but the reasons to enjoy them
 have not always been the same.  Some really cool stuff has come out of
 the HOE factory.  There has been some solid gold from this zine that I
 can say has actually made a difference in my life.  I can't say that
 about most other zines.  Mogel, if you've ever worried about it, I can't
 say that about CDC.  You did it back then, and there is no question that
 you have done it now, but HOE is different.  HOE is a special zine to many
 people and we won't forget it (especially if you leave all of those old
 files online).

        Ok, enough sap.

 Sincerely,
 BMC - The Neo-Comintern

 MOGEL by Meenk

        Over six years.  For what would appear to be a third of his life,
 Mogel has toiled tirelessly, oftentimes ignoring his body's cry for such
 base needs as food, sleep, and sex (especially sex).

        What for?  For you, of course, gentle reader.  Mogel has sacrificed
 a significant chunk of his life organizing writers, coming up with ideas,
 proofreading over 5000 text files, and being a friend to everyone in the
 scene, making sure there would not be a moment where someone said, "Oh boo.
 I have nothing to read while at work in order to look productive, while
 saving the trouble of actually thinking," as well as allowing every idiot
 with a text editor to stand on a soapbox and be heard.  In wasting so much
 of his time, Mogel has wasted much of our time.  For this, he deserves our
 deepest gratitude, and I am certain I am not alone when I say "Thank you,
 Mogel. Thank you for bringing us HOE, and thank you for laying the group to
 rest with dignity and care."

        ...wait a second.

        IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT MOGEL IS _NOT_ 19 YEARS OLD,
 BUT _24_.  THEREFORE HE HAS _NOT_ SPENT A THIRD OF HIS LIFE TENDING TO
 THIS PIECE OF SHIT ZINE.  ALL THIS TIME I FELT SORRY FOR HIM, HOLDING HIM
 AGAINST MY BREAST WHILE HE LAMENTED ABOUT HOW MUCH OF HIS LIFE HE HAS
 MISSED OUT ON BECAUSE HE HAD TO STAY HOME AND PROOFREAD.  AS IF IT IS
 SUCH A TOUGH JOB.  IT ISN'T LIKE HE IS EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES!
 HALF OF THE FILES HOE HAS RELEASED PISS ON THE STANDARDS OF SPELLING AND
 GRAMMAR, AND FULLY ONE THIRD ARE UNINTELLIGIBLE.  I SAY WE MAKE MOGEL GIVE
 US THE HOE WE DESERVE.  HE OWES US _AT LEAST_ A THIRD OF HIS LIFE, IF NOT
 ALL OF IT.  IT HAS TAKEN SO LONG TO GET THE "FINAL" ISSUE OUT THAT I AM
 SURE WHATEVER REAL LIFE CRISISES THAT CAME UP REQUIRING HIS ATTENTION
 HAVE LONG SINCE PASSED.

        MOGEL SHALL BE OURS _FOREVER_.

 Gosh, this picture of a rose makes me think that HOE was all just a bed
 of roses and star dust memories, but gosh, there are a few people who
 we've hurt along the way.

 MY LAST TEXT FILE FOR HOE by Big Daddy Bill

        Maybe it's because your better writers.  Maybe it's because your
 not really better writers, it's just I'm a really *bad* writer.  But it's
 probably because I live by a few certain morals and ethics that even
 though they are sometimes ignored, it's all I've really got.  It doesn't
 make sense to treat people bad in this world, since all around us is
 badness.  What comes around goes around, I always say.  I've come to this
 one simple conclusion:

        With a few exceptions, and I mean few... you're bad people.

        Your cruelty is unheard of, and I refuse to even be associated with
 most of you.  If it wasn't for the fact that a lot of you had talent,
 and Phairgirl was a good friend of mine, I wouldn't have even joined.

        It was being accepted by such a small, seemingly elite group of
 writers that turned me on to begin with.  The more I chatted with the group
 of you, and read your stories, I realized that your only defense mechanism
 is the humiliation and petty teasing of others.  It's like you thrive on
 it.  Someone elses pain is your material, right?  Wrong.

        I quit.  I don't need this.  Nobody needs this.

 I'M DONE by Six (AliCam!)

 Dear Various HOE writers and chatters of #ezines:

        Just so you all know, I am writing this on August 20, 1999 at
 4:33pm, before I read Nybar's ADVICE LETTER (HOE #799).  If I choose to
 read it at all that is.  Anyway.. In high school I was in honors classes
 and I hated them, so very much.  I used to think it was because I was
 forced into them by my parents, but now I realize that wasn't the case at
 all.  It was simply because smart kids are assholes.  I miss being 15 and
 reading thoughtful books by European novelists and thinking I knew
 everything in the world.  Thinking everything revolved around me.  That I
 was more intelligent than everyone else.  I recall back then some older
 girls on that chat I called didn't like me very much at all and I never
 understood why.  Now I do.

        In like 4 years (give or take), when you stop being insane, you're
 going to wake up.  It's very weird, I don't remember what I was doing but
 something changed.  Suddenly the advice my mother gave me was something I
 listened to, I no longer had the desire to rebel, and I didn't know it all
 anymore.  I know most of you think I'm stupid, but odds are you would
 actually like me if you took the time to talk to me instead of
 automatically disagreeing with everything I have to say.  Being smart
 doesn't make you better.  Thinking so is just another way of being shallow.
 I may not know anything about philosophy, I may be from NJ, I may not be
 into anything PC or trendy in that underground kind of way like most of you
 are.  However I have always acted like myself and never put on an act for
 you guys.  If thats not good enough for you, I'm sorry.  Someday I hope
 you all get over yourselves.  It's was a good time, HOE, see ya around.

 I quit.

 Sincerely,
 Six aka AliCam
 P.S. This letter was not directed to everyone.

 From: "Cindy Spurlock" <stripe@mindspring.com>
 To: mogel@hoe.nu

        Nothing seems to have really changed in six years. I've been putting
 off writing something for this big BANG finale issue of HOE for over a
 month now... and here we are, at the twilight of the deadline, and what
 have I produced?  Nothing, nada, zilch.  Have I entertained a few ideas?
 Yes.  I just can't bring myself to sit down and pretend to be something
 that I'm not... to write in the expected style or to spit out a
 carefully-crafted, well-intentioned, glittering piece of empty rhetoric or
 perfectly plastic prose.

        As I've spent the last 5+ years observing from the sidelines and
 never really immersing myself into the HOE culture, I've always been the
 objective outsider pressing her nose against the smokescreen of ezine
 culture and never quite the active participant.  You learn a lot when
 you're detached.  That sense of obligation that one has when one is
 committed to a group is missing when you're on the outside looking in.
 You see, writing may come naturally to me, but this entire "scene" has
 never really been what I would consider to be an "accepting" or even a
 creative collective capable of offering CONSTRUCTIVE criticism--apparently,
 even "outcasts" form pecking orders.  I shouldn't have expected more;
 apparently, it's not natural.  Pseudo-intellectual pissing contests are
 just not my idea of fun.

        Everyone has always, and will continue to, feed off of each other's
 egos... I've never found that to be appealing.  For intelligentsia, we
 [the HOE collective] certainly act like children.  It's always saddened
 me in a way.  We've had the potential to BE, but we've just posed in the
 doorway of higher understanding, shirking, smirking and doing anything
 necessary to maintain the status quo.  For an "alternative culture", we're
 not very alternative at all.  Sometimes, it seems as if the text files,
 the bulletin boards and the chat sessions have served no other purpose
 than to repair someone's self esteem, to help Johnny Cool or Rachel Radical
 get that chip off of their shoulder.  We all have problems, but being a
 well-to-do teen can't possibly be THAT bad.

        Sure, I write my ass off for my college newspaper.  And when I'm not
 writing, I edit, edit, and edit some more until I'm babbling about the
 differences between AP standard and CMS standard in my sleep.  I edit.  I
 write.  I read.  That's what I do.  For some reason, aside from the fact
 that the ability to express myself [and to improve upon the writing of
 others] comes naturally to me, writing and editing are more than tasks or
 hobbies.  One of the things that initially drew me toward the ezine scene
 was the fact that when I was growing up, no one thought that writing or
 being creative was cool.  Being interested in reading was something that
 could get your glasses knocked off your face at recess.  It was the initial
 IDEALS, the PRINCIPLES of HOE and other text groups that caught my
 attention.  I was excited!  "Wow," I thought.  "People like me who like
 the things that I do... who have experienced what I have experienced."

        It's amazing just how wrong one can be.  It's also amazing how much
 it sucks when your beliefs that you want so DESPERATELY to be true turn
 out to be false.  Maybe things would have been different had I spoken up.
 Maybe, but doubtful.  Maybe things would have been different had I not
 had such lofty expectations for HOE and its collection of writers and
 groupies.  Maybe.  If anything, my experiences around the fringe have
 taught me many things.  I do believe that the last six years could have
 been so much more if it weren't for everyone trying (whether they admit
 it publicly or not) to out-do, out-cool, or out-asshole the others in the
 group.  Then again, I shouldn't expect so much.  After six years, it seems
 as if many of us haven't learned that we can be different, radical, and
 alternative, on the inside without having to brand our worldviews and
 philosophies on EVERYTHING that we come into contact.  It's the
 twenty-something equivalent of "Look Ma, no hands!" exhibitionism.  It's
 everything that I despise and yet, here is this collective group of people
 who probably have more in common with each other than they will ever know
 that can't seem to go for more than three hours with exploding into a
 mudslinging contest.  Why?!?

         It's the question that I've been asking myself.  It's the question
 that I can't seem to answer.  But then again, maybe it doesn't deserve an
 answer.  After all, I just have my nose pressed to the glass.

 :: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::

 Dear Cindy Spurlock, 

	Mogel forwarded me the mail you sent him, in which you give us your
 withering critique of the scene (so-called) and HOE, en general. While I
 think some of your points are undeniably valid, you seem to missing some
 vital information and criteria. I'm drafting this letter in the hopes that
 in the end you'll turn your loathing off of us and back to its proper
 focus. By that, of course, I mean to say your own bespectacled, book
 loving self.

	(In a way, of course, your slanderous condemnation of the entire
 scene (so-called) and HOE (en general) could be read backwards in a mirror
 as a bitter indictment of yourself and your own world views. You're not
 someone who has a strong ego, nor do you actually truly believe the things
 you say you do. Perhaps you don't believe them on a subconscious level,
 but no one pushed to defend themselves by the threat of (gasp!) having to
 write something for the final HOE could ever actually believe the ramparts
 they've constructed. You write to us, because, in effect, you are writing
 to yourself. The more you express it, the easier it becomes to swallow.
 Yes.)

	Anyhow, let's get along to the first, and obviously most important
 point: HOE has been a joke for (at least) as long as my involvement with
 it. If we've slandered each other and done other mean things, then we never
 *really* meant it. Sure, I could call you a craven cock gurgling whore, but
 what would that mean? Honestly? Nothing. You're last tuesday to me, babe,
 and so is everyone in HOE and everything we ever did. 
 
	I realize this might seem to you, and all the beautiful others, as
 some sort of cop-out (so-called). Big deal. 

	Secondly, and not any less importantly, HOE is crap. I realize that
 some of our lesser folks, and oh there are many, haven't ever been able to
 get a fully tenuable grasp on this concept, so let me repeat it a second
 time: HOE IS CRAP! Get it? It's *total shit*, and that's all it ever was.
 All of this great promise that we, the intelligensia (so-called), have
 thrown away into the void of nothingness is a total and utter lie crafted
 by those of you who have never been able to buy into the fundamental
 reality of HOE's existence. We publish *total shit* because *total shit*
 makes us laugh.

	The idea that we're all in it together for the pursuit of knowledge
 and the gratification of the erudition that comes from being THE
 INTELLGENSIA is an ill suited idea. I think you might want to go talk to
 the Neo-Futurists out of Chicago or whomever, because baby, we ain't
 artful, we ain't smart, we ain't pretty, and we sure as fuck ain't
 successful. Go look at the first 10 HOE files. Go look at that the last
 ten HOE files. Compare & Contrast? What's gotten better, what's gotten
 worse?

	Nothing.

	HOE is a static entity. 

 	And I realize, baby, that this might come as a horrible shock to
 your system, that the people who seem talented and might be STARS!@$!@ just
 want to shit it all away on dick and pussy jokes, but those kids who
 smacked your ass down in 3rd grade were right: you're a fucking jackass
 for attributing any importance to any of this. Books mean nothing. Writing
 means nothing. Reading means nothing. At the end of the long cold weary day
 when your life is dwindling down and you're sad and lonely, it's not going
 to be a book that changes your soiled bedsheets, and it's not going to be
 a book that gives in to your crackling demands for an assisted suicide. 
 
	It amazes me that your major complaint with HOE seems to be that
 we've never, how would you say it, grown up? We've never realized that
 jesus! we can be totally innovative without making other people feel bad
 or trying to force our world views on everything else? 
 
	It amazes me because that's the very thing you did in your mail:
 you made me feel bad and you forced your world view onto HOE, which never
 fit it, and never will. You presume so god damned much about HOE and about
 the scene and about US that you never bother to look with that strange
 lens of objective clarity that you blather on about so much. Baby, take a
 deep hard look at what I'm saying, because this is the straight up from
 the horse's mouth gully jimson truth. Ain't nothing truer. 

	Finally, I suppose I should address making each other feel bad. 

	But I won't, except to say that the ultimate form of innovation is
 making your neighbor feel acutely aware of how big a piece of shit he's
 become.
 
	Anyway baby, I am, 

 Sincerely Yours, 
 AIDS

        dear ORIGINAL REAL nirvana fan,

        I fall into that category as well and I agree with everything you
        said in that txt (HOE #6) but man...as for the lyrics...a lot of
        them are wrong.  you should go on to their sites for lyrics but a
        lot of them have mistakes too!  as for endless nameless, the last
        song on nevermind, you'll find a hundred different versions of
        the 'correct lyrics' but that's bullshit cuz he changes the words
        with each performance...

        I'm gonna read your other shit since I enjoyed the first one so
        much...if you want the lyrics to any of the songs or anything else
        just mail me.

        well...as you may or may not know, i have just finished reading
 your text file on shit...and as impressed as i was, i was extremely
 disappointed and hurt.  you are one of few who have the privelege of
 realizing the genuine value of our feces, but you seemed to have
 overlooked its main purpose!  shit, as is the clouds in the sky, is a key
 in true art.  whence do you think the influential inspiration of michael
 angelo, picasso, bosch was discoverd to create these paintings that are
 often even described as shit?  each and every shit is different, as you
 mentioned, and holds the origin of art as we know it within each one of
 its intricate lines and folds.

        it all began back in the day when stuff happened to those people at
 that place and there was that day when the fellow with the hair decided to
 study the beautiful poopy that ejected from his gluteus maximus...he found
 all sorts of images and the answers to all of his questions on life and
 where it was going, but that's more on to the topic of bland and unorginal
 as those today and resolved to do as he did and that's how art became.

 "A little truth about Mogel"
 by oregano

        If oyu give a bunch of Legos to mogel and cstone and effy and
 trilobyte and swisspope here is what you get.

        effy makes a house complete with a nice little sidewalk and lots of
 comfy windows and working doors and plants and a wall to keep the rabbits
 out of the garden

        cstone just sort of connects things at random and unconnects things
 at random making a random mess of Legos - though he does have a good
 command of where various pieces are say when trilocyte needs a Lego shaped
 like a plant.

        trilobyte makes a mecha-soldier bent on world destruction.

        swisspope I cannot remember.  Sorry pope.

        but Mogel, what does he make?  something manly like a death ray gun
 or a high powered race car?  nope, he makes a Zamboni, the things that
 come out in hockey games to smooth out the ice.

 ABOUT MOGEL by dinkee

        oh, how i would love to walk around mogel's brain, just to see how
 colorful those cells are like.  how i would love to wake up in the morning
 to be bombarded with a million text files to edit and cut and sort.  what
 a miracle it would be to be adored by so many (yes, i'm included!) and
 loved by all.  the almighty mogel with his almighty hoe.

        i've not known him long, but even five minutes with this 'zine hero
 is like a lifetime in this cyber world.  if i could show him the twinkle
 in my eye that i hold for him, i would sing lovingly about how the birds
 and the bees do it, the trees do it even little something somethings do it!

        as for the final tribute of hoe, i will cry long hours knowing
 that mogel will no longer be sorting our files out, no longer be reading
 our deep fantasies and fears.  therefore i write this last textfile as
 mogel sorts, edits and cuts this one to show him me deep utter
 fascination.  yes, i'm mogel-obsessed.  we all are, but i'm proud to
 admit it.

        <stands up>  My name is dinkee. i am a mogelaholic.

 Take a moment and reflect on your feelings for text files.

 ...

 You're not doing it, are you?  I don't blame you.  You're either some
 kid that Mogel or one of his cohorts dragged into this thing, ignorant
 of the origins of Le Text Philo, (http://www.textfiles.com educates, baby!)
 or you're some guy that's trying desperately to forget all those
 wasted years.

 But gosh, those days were so romantic.

 "ASSHOLES, THE REASON I WISH I WAS A BOY"
 by Poppy Z Brite

        I keep thinking about him, when he was there at the club, dressed
 like some ghost from an ancient Japanese wood cut, or maybe from a mid
 period horror film. His waifish little ways, so androgynous, so strange, he
 was like Dracula's wives, not the Bela Lugosi Dracula, no, but the wives
 of Christopher Lee, from the Hammer Dracula Films.

        The Cure were playing and I couldn't help but notice he looked like
 Robert Smith with his black shock of hair hanging down over his face like
 icicles. I wondered what his asshole was like. I knew it would smell musty
 and there'd be the scent of his balls slightly masking it, but I knew I
 could smell his masculine richness if I brought him home and cracked open
 his legs. Would he go with me?

        He was clearly homosexual, I kept watching his eyes float over other
 boys' crotches, and I knew I'd never have a chance. My love is a shameful
 sickness. I am a female. Oh, I wish I was a boy. I'd like to crawl into bed
 with every queer boy I see, the asian ones especially, and rip off their
 pants. I'd taste their smooth creamy cock in my mouth and then I'd flip
 them over and spread wide their ass.

        My cock would rip into them, biting like the nails into Christ's
 wrists, and they would respond and wiggle as I fucked them. I would control
 them with my cock. It's like a line I read in William S. Burroughs that
 goes: "His face was an equation written in the Algebra of pain." Did I
 mention that Robert Crumb is a big influence on me? But he isn't gay, and
 not particularly attractive or asian, so I wouldn't really like to sleep
 with him.

        but oh, how I wanted to fuck this boy. I'd shove my fingers in his
 ass and smell the shit on them. It would be the essence of love's bitter
 mysteries. I'd like to go down and lick that asshole, tasting it, watching
 him react like a puppet on a string of livewires, my tongue shooting
 electricity up his ass.

        My cock, oh shit, it would be so hard by now. It would be raging
 erection, nine inches of meat, and I would spit on it, the scent of my
 saliva slightly nauseating me, slightly driving away the scent of his ass,
 and then I would fucking stick it in. Pow! Like that! Right to the moon!
 And I would pile drive and backpack his body while I listened to the sweet
 crooning sounds of Leonard Cohen  interspersed in a mural of sound with the
 deep voices of Peter Steel and

        Smearing his makeup so he looked like Lon Chaney in London After
 Midnight... Oh god... it would be so good to be a gay man in this mythical
 idealized world of mine...

 Ah, yes. Asmodeus Rex. What an asshole! He spent hours and hours plaguing
 this old, somewhat crippled woman who was running a BBS on her C=128.
 And when he'd get caught, he'd get all upset. What a luser!

 (of course, I'm assuming that it's Rex who's the one carrying on and
 dissing my good name. For what it's worth, I was indeed voted into this
 august band of ne'er do wells, malcontents, and genial perverts some years
 ago, and have had several of my t-files included in various cDc releases.)

 But I guess that's not good enough for some of these |<ewl deweds from RI,
 that hotbed of the Computer Underground. Argh! 

 In any event, I'm SURE you can tell how broken up I am over all this.

 Don't apologise for incoherant messages, I rather like them, myself. I can
 always use the intellectual stimulation of, "What the FUCK is going on
 about?" (life is pretty dull and boring here in the vermin infested
 crotch of New England.)

 WHY I HATE FIDONET by VisioKnight
 Written 10/21/94

 Let's examine the rotting pinnacle of modern day computer mail society;
 no, not Usenet; no, not RIME; that aging fat dinosaur of a system known
 as FIDONET.

 Right now, you may be thinking, "Hey!  Shut the fuck up, I LIKE Fidonet!".
 You may also be thinking about molesting aborted babies.  The two activities
 are about on the same level of thinking.

 Enough with my ranting;  let's do an in-depth examination of what Fidonet
 is, and why YOU should hate it too.

 1)  Fidonet is designed to be free.  It isn't.

 Let's see.  Free mail, free communications, free speech.  No.  None of the
 above.  Unless you a) Own Telco, b) Own a Satellite Dish, or c) are
 independently wealthy, you will need to either call long-distance (usually
 the case) to a hub, or pay a local person to call there for you.
 This is a big needle up the ass.  I've seen people charge as much as
 $5 per message area per month.  Yea.  Blow me.

 Free speech.  Uh-uh.   Almost every single damn fidonet echo is moderated
 by this idiot designated as the moderator by a bunch of voting pricks.  The
 moderator's sole purpose is to negate any pleasurable conversation you may
 be expecting to have in his godlike domain.   Stray 001 degree from his
 set guidelines, and you can get your whole system banned from the echo, or
 from Fidonet.  Fun, right.

 2)  Fidonet is designed to be fun.  It isn't.

 Ever met a person who posts 7 messages in the STARWARS echo wanting to know
 what the hell Star Trek is and why everyone in the Star Trek echo talks 
 about it?  Ever met a person who thinks TEEN is a child-porn echo?  Ever
 met the most foolish person in the world?  Join fidonet.  

 And lastly;

 3)  Fidonet is supposed to be modern.  Infer this sentence.

 Theoretically, Fidonet shouldn't work.  Systems all over the world tossing
 mail to hubs.  Hmm. 

 Fidonet also takes up an extremely large amount of disk space.

 Fidonet is full of trendy people.

 So, if you're a sysop, do your users a favor and become a member of, say,
 an interesting network.  Leave fidonet to my anus.

 GR> I think i was allways under the impression it meant:"Supah, above all..

 You know what being elite in RI means? Being elite in RI means that you
 kiss a few certain peoples asses. Being elite means pretending that
 netwars actually mean something. Being elite means pretending that wares
 are actually worth something more than getting games. Being elite means
 that even if you don't *READ* OR *PRODUCE* text, if you have a lot of it,
 then you're cool. Being elite means commiting telephone fraud for no real
 reason except to talk to other people in other cities because for some
 reason or the other you are incapable of finding people to relate to in
 your world. Being elite means thinking that you are *BETTER* than people
 simply because you happen to be a bit more mature or a bit more seasoned,
 or a bit more experienced. Any moron with enough time on his hands can
 hack. Any moron with enough time on his hands can phreak. Any moron who
 can act like the powers that be can be ELITE.

 Is that what you want to be? Someone who lies about how he truly feels
 because he doesn't want to be rejected by the powers that be? 

 Here's what it comes to : I just plain don't give a fuck anymore. 

 If Soth thinks that he's elite, fine. That's not something to aspire to.

 how can you judge me, if you've never taken a walk in my shoes?

 Title: ...

     My apologies to Identity Crisis, who has already heard of what I am
 about to tell you on the Cyber Cafe BBS.  I think it's worth the repition.

     I have just heard of the most horrendous offense I have ever come
 across, and let me tell you that I have looked into many.  Perhaps it's so
 horrible because it's so "close to home," so to speak.  Not in distance,
 but in worlds.  And I am making so reference to Earth.

     To begin.

     About two years ago, in the United Staes - I can't for the life of me
 remember where it took place even though I just heard of it not ten minutes
 ago - four young girls - 15, 16, 16, and 17 - lured another young girl,
 12, with a name sounding similar with "Shanda," into an abandoned house
 near her home.  They tortured her.  Brutally.  Please believe me when I
 say "brutally"; it was BRUTAL.  As an example... They sodomized her with
 a jagged metal bar.  For those of you who do not know what that is, it's
 defined as either anal sex with a member of the same gender, or "anal
 copulation with instruments of animals," a definition taken almost
 directly from the dictionary.

     For SEVEN FUCKING HOURS they kept her there, torturing her, all four
 taking their turns.

     They through her in the trunk of their car and drove to another, more
 secluded site in the "boonies," where they proceded to drench her in
 gasoline and set fire to her.  As they drove off, they realized that the
 fire was beginning to die, so they drove back and made sure they got the
 job done.  Then they went to McDonald's for breakfast.

     [Shanda] died of smoke inhalation.  Meaning she lived for quite awhile
 while afire before she actually died.

     An obvious complete lack of regard for human life.

     For two years these people insisted on blaming it on a mental disorder,
 though all four who were questioned by the prison's psycholist were
 completely rational, calm, and uncaring.

     One of the mothers of the killers admitted that two of the four had
 just recently had excorcists performed on them for demon possession.  Now
 either these people are just stupid, or they're not making mention of it
 for a reason.

     EVERY one of these acts of the killers are taken WORD FOR WORD out of
 the Satanic Bible, coming from one who has read it and knows of the shit
 he has in its pages.

     In a word.

     Satanism.  I'm almost convinced of it.

     To anyone who has any more information on what happened, please leave
 me email.  I have to wonder if I'm right or not.  It seems too... Easy to
 blame a disorder for it.

     And why, after all this shit, do I still feel sorrow for these four
 girls and hope that the judgement put on them is as mercyful as the LACK
 of mercy that they displayed on [Shanda].

     Sometimes I wonder how the fuck my mind works.
     Thank you for your time.
     Return to your own worlds, please.

 -Sorrow.

 RAMBLINGS ABOUT THE LIFE OF A STUPID COMPUTER NERD WHO FAILS AT EVERYTHING
 or HI I'M ROB THE MORON

        Well, my full name is Robert William Alexander Pascual.

        I am 16 years old.

        I have long brown hair and brown eyes (subjects me to screams of
 faggot and pussy around all the retards my age).

        I stare at a computer for the majority of the day, don't fall
 asleep until 5 AM and wake up around 4PM.  I cheated out of highschool
 with the CHSPE and now am a bum.  Whatever the fuck all that means anyways.

        On random Bulletin boards and some of the shittier parts of the
 internet I have had many shitty aliases: Rob (isn't that one brilliant?),
 Catman (retarded name I got in elementary school because I liked cats),
 Lostcat, Kalacus, and probably like tens of others that I forgot about.

        Anyone in 408 remember The Vortex? (hey zerosouls if you are
 reading this e-mail me) Bulletin boards officially died here when that
 board went out.  Where I first read hoe a few years back as a matter of
 fact...Reading text files was probably when my brain realized that the
 world isn't a happy place where bunnies hop around and people love each
 other.... consequently, I ended up become athiest and pissing off my
 parents... I later become wiccan and pissed them off more.  I finally am
 where I am now which is that religion is fucking obnoxious and it just
 causes many people to get killed and tortured and that all religions
 suck ass.

        God damn it no one understands me.

        my parents think I'm a fucking bum... god damn it but the only
 place that I could get a fucking job is the 7-11 and I don't want to work
 somewhere stupid like that. I'm not going to learn shit from that except
 that people like to smoke their lungs out until they die of cancer, and
 that people for some reason enjoy getting totally wasted on alcohol.

        I hate relationships... I totally love this chick but like the
 relationship part sucks, I wish she would like spend more time with me and
 I wish she would stop getting jealous over girls I don't even like.

        what was I rambling about?  I dunno.  oh well... I'm gonna talk
 about my trenchcoat... my trenchcoat is so sexy...I love how people don't
 fuck with me or call me pussy or anything after that whole columbine
 thing...way I see if someone is retarded enough to think I'm going to
 shoot them up then they can believe it.

        Speaking of columbine, who the fuck cares?  what like 10 people or
 something died?  I wonder how many retarded middle eastern people kill
 each other in stupid jihads and shit like that.  I wonder how many die
 of starvation.  but no, this was different.  these were your perfect
 little rich white boys that don't do things like that... whatever

        by the way I'm not rich... my dad is a fucking cheapass. my first
 computer was a C64 and 2400 baud modem.  it  stayed that way until like
 about three years ago when I got a 386... ooh wow.  2400's are so
 fucking horrid.  You can watch the text scroll on to the screen.  and damn
 that C64 didn't even have 80 columns, so it faked it with a fucking
 4x8 font that burned my eyes out and made the ANSI suck.

        It saddens me to hear that hoe is going to die... I loved it...
 and still do...to all you fags, child molesters, porn stars (i dunno),
 k-rad hacker types, and other freakass people that wrote for HOE:
 I love you. hehe, my favorite was the poetic terrorist... anyways!

        WHERE THE FUCK DID ANSI GO???? STUPID NUTSCRAPE AND INTERNET...god
 I liked online when it was just the BBS's and the freaks... my mom and
 some old lady down the street weren't online being dumb like they are
 now... and shit whats up with .com this e-that?  hey zerosouls...no
 disrespect but get your ass back from college or wherever and start the
 scene up again... it died when you left.

        GOODBYE HOE...MAY YOU REST IN BLOODY PIECES FOR ALL OF ETERNITY

 - Rob pascual (rob_the_insomniac@yahoo.com)

 P.S. - Seriously, though, zerosouls if you're reading this please bug me,
        and anyone else out there is welcome to say hi.

 :: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::

 To answer your question about THE HISTORY OF ANSI GRAPHICS, we've decided
 to ask RaDMaN of ACiD PRODUCTIONS about it.

 Interview conducted in '94.  Here goes.

 Radman: "I saw some ansis by the <AAA> artist Chips Ahoy, the first guy who
          actually gave me the idea that ANSI could be used as a medium for
          visual arts. At the time ('88) I was just another lamer with their
          own h/p/a group, and I drew up an ansi logo combining like two
          colors with the shading blocks, a logo for "HEaT", this stumbled
          into the right hands (the president of <AAA>), and I was quickly
          accepted."

         "Back then there was no ansi-art scene, and I didn't really see any
          difference between warez and p/h/a, except that you needed a
          bigger hard drive to be a major warez affiliated board, and you
          didn't need to carry text files.  Other than that, I felt they
          all went hand in hand."

         "Well, after a while in <AAA> the group was growing stagnant minus
          the two other most active artists that were "recruited" into AAA.
          It was a unanimous decision that a newer more structured group was
          needed by myself."

        "I don't feel pressure, or allow any pressure to be put upon me.  Of
	 course tho I see the competition, and I thrive upon it. It is
         healthy for groups and practically necessary for their existence
         and growth to have competition.  When I see the little alternative
         groups, I see pluses and minuses.  The pluses are such that they
         bring out new up-and-coming artists that many people may have never
         seen other wise, that they help expand the ever growing art scene,
         and I also think some of them remind us where most of us came from.
         The downsides are that some people get too carried away, a lot of
         them are built upon hype and propaganda, many never get to or past
         pack one, some of them can tear apart what could have or should
         have been potentially good groups.  I could really go on forever
         arguing for both sides."

        "I've learned that alot of people can ruin the scene for themselves
	 by taking it too far or too seriously.  I've seen alot of good
	 friends and acquaintances quit the scene over silly reasons.  The
	 worst I see are people with their scene pessimism, that spend their
	 free time complaining about how much the scene sucks.  If you are
	 that deep into the scene, that it actually DEPRESSES you, REALLY,
	 then you need to go outside and take a break."

        "There are tons of great ansi mags still in production, some of the
         greatest (in my opinion of course) are Continuum, Bitchslap, and
         for the light-hearted Emigre is very cool ansi mag, and has a great
	 interface.  The worst ansi mags out there are the review mags that
	 proclaim they have figured out the CORRECT and right way to review
	 and they are so high up on themselves they believe they are the
	 bottom line and last word of all that can be said on critiquing
	 artwork, and in turn these usually turn out to be the shoddiest
	 mags."

        "The scene is great, the only thing I would like to see is the
         mental separation of different underground scenes and the negative
	 connotations some may hold, and the preconceptions help between
	 different ignoramuses in various scenes. I figure if you give
	 respect, you will get respect."

 I can't believe you read that, you fucking gimp.

 "Fun with Shopping carts"
 by Viggen

        Most of you will have seen at least one shopping cart in a place
 where it probably shouldn't be--on top of someones car, upside down in
 the middle of a road, in several pieces underneath a bridge, or even on
 top of playground equipment which has lots of fresh graffiti all over it.
 You've probably also had races using them.  Shopping carts have many
 more potential uses than just as mere racing vehicles though.  They can be
 an excellent source of fun if you can't afford a can of gasoline, some
 matches and a copy of your neighbour's house key.

        Shopping carts are kinda heavy, which means they'll cause a lot of
 damage when dropped off the side of your local mall's rooftop carpark onto
 a red honda prelude below.  Shitting on the bonnet afterwards can make for
 a few laughs, too, as can stealing the car's stereo and selling it so you
 can buy more drugs.

        They will also cause a bit of damage if you leave them upside down
 (so they don't slide away so easily) in the middle of the road, just round
 a blind corner that people have a habit of speeding round, though they'll
 usually only cause minor bumper damage.  Depends on the car.

        When dropped from the highest points of bridges onto hard surfaces,
 the basket bits will sometimes break off, and occasionally the wheels will
 break, too.

        If you have a few stolen ones sitting around at your place, another
 thing you can do is to get drunk, take them to the primary school (that's
 elementary school for all you Americans) down the road from you and put
 them upside down on big wooden poles which are on the top of the school
 play-fort-thingy.  Take marker pens with you, too, and write shit like
 "Show your dick to the girls" and "Put carrots in your ass and do it in
 class" everywhere, as well as drawing pictures of naked people.

        There you have it!

        Shopping carts can be a lot of fun if you're bored.

        a few months ago me and some dudes were trading posts at egroups.com
 under the group BigProblems where you can find a whole bevy of pornographic
 stories about music theory!

 ------

        So today I'm walking around the red line, the braintree station,
 and I'm blitzed.  You heard me right, Puff Daddy, I was pissa stoned, and
 ruminative.  It's like this.  A friend of mine, whose name happens to
 be 'neurotic lesbian telephone morissette' is making a game based on
 several precepts.

        1. the map is built first, by the players, out of hexagons (6 sided
 polygons) and each polygon can have, on each of its six sides either an
 arrow pointing out, one pointing in, or blank. The polygons can be held
 together in a tesselated fashion, but in order for a piece place to be
 legal one of its own arrows must have positive polarity i.e. must point in
 the same direction.

        2. once the map is done being placed, and scored (scoring not yet
 determined), the pieces come out. The pieces are either positive, or
 negative (indicating whether they go with, or against the current).

        So I propose a computer model which will run (roughly) as follows:

    1. pray to god 'alanis morissette pampers dildo lesbian'
    2. make a structure of 'piece' including: sides[6] and neighbor states
       [x][y]
    3. make a structure called map. the map structure array ought to
       contain a char array. the char array will be linear as follows:
       given (x, y) a whole bunch of these to describe a grid, make a list
       of characters that stands for every x,y, saving space. make the map
       64X64 because there is a multiplication that allows the x and y in
       question to morph into the number value of what we want accessed in
       the list.
    4. tough enough? aight. there is only one function needed to access
       any given piece via the char pointers through the multiplication bit
       shift thing. you take x and y. they are zero. now we make a list

       map[x-1][y]//1
       map[x-1][y+1]//2
       map[x][y+]//3
       map[x][y]//4
       map[x][y+1]//5
       map[x+1][y]//6
       map[x+1][y+1]//7

       all you have to do is put the x and the y of the pointed to piece
 into each following transformations. in order, you'll get:

       1,2
      3,4,5
       6,7

        now, i'm telling you THAT so's i can tell you this.

        I am ripshit wasted.  At the T.  I'm looking at the bricks.
 thinking of how a hexagonal map is rows and cols where

 1 2 3 4 5
  1 2 3 4 5

        the numbers are a little crooked. I look at the bricks. Guess what
 the bricks were doing. Yup. Exactly what I was thinking about. I scan over
 the bricks. That's the map. Freely accessible. I make a 'node' from one
 brick. My brain kicks for a second as I gather its neighbors into a
 pattern. I start walking around with my power, casting nodes here and
 thar. New England architecture is terrible. There is an invariable point
 where the weight of the train, a leak and frost heaves have combined to
 ruin one specific part of bricks. Understanding that I am in one of my
 'states' and probably under light self hypnosis, I proceed toward the
 broken bricks, because that is a lot more like the way that my personal
 talent as a programmer works- broken, unprofessional, plus historically
 I know that a self-hypnotized state aided by a psychotropic chemical like
 marijuana, it is important to break out of the bricks while being of the
 bricks, cause there's one more thing to see. One brick, split down the
 middle, perfectly bisects the up and down neighbors. So I double the grid.

        I hope that I have just successfully proven the might and authority
 of 'janice morissette pampers lesbian' and 'new york port terminal
 bus station authority'

 so every two points (DWORDs) 7 groups- root,2,3,4,5,6,7 ending before
 octave. so each piece can have up to six sides, each side containing
 1-3 pieces of information. let ANY THREE LEGAL WHITE MAN'S NOTES IN
 THE WESTERN 12 TONE SYSTEM be these pieces. Generate them randomly.
 Then forget exactly how this idea went.

 DOCTOR SHEPTAGON wants you to see his friends
 HIDDEN MATRIX FRIEND: YOU CAN TRANSFORM UP TO 64 NOTES FROM A HIGHLY
 HACKABLE RANDOM INTEGER GENERATOR, EACH GENERATING A PIECE, WHICH
 PIECE IS FED TO THE ACCESSOR RANDOMLY. I WANT TO PUT LYDIAN CHROMATIC

 well, testicle buttplug alanis morissette vagina queen insect!

 why didn't you just say so? here is one piece...
 piece[randompiecenumber]
 has
 6 sides
 sound[1]the sound can either be no movement or movement right or left
 along one point of the 12 tone scale.
 sounds[...nsounds] ditto!!

 each sound is predetermined by the composer

 typedef struct alanis_morisette_chicken_faggot
 {
 sides[6]//info on sides
 neighborstates[6] each side on the map
 }piece, *piece_ptr;

        char *MAP[64]

        and map[x][y] etc etc the whole x+1 y-1 y+1 shit is tricky

        so we 'build' pieces.

        if pieces are both blank, musical transport is between them is not
 moving along a pre-chosen point on a string of consecutive integers.  if
 they are blocked to one another, they are moving in opposite relative
 direction along a twelve-tone list. if consonant, they move along the
 same direction.

        WHAT THE COMPOSER CONTROLS: every single piece and every single
 rest, just as in classical, pre digital composition anal alanis morisette
 testicle stuffing

        WHAT HE DOES NOT CONTROL: what order of any piece will be accessed
 within his node. He has reasonable certainty that notes in the same
 piece will be more likely to be played within six iterations of one
 another.

        WHAT THE PROGRAMMER HAS NOT FIGURED OUT YET:
        a lot of picky C linguistics
        why the POPEDEVIL will not allow magnetic resonance of ALANIS
        MORISETTE chicken laxatives.
        how it will play. I see node walking.

        AND NOW...

        for my next trick and before I commence work on my soon-to-be
 epic 'WHY AOL HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT THE SAME THING AS REALLY BEING GAY' I
 will stop going online for more than twelve hours at a time while
 incapacitated and have, tomorrow, a refreshing day on no computer,
 television, console games on the dreamcast or n64 or the computer, and
 relaxing while reading GRAVITY'S RAINBOW for the vagina mutant fatt

 AN IMPORTANT & CLIMATIC RHEA FILE TO SERVE AS A PUNCTUATION TO HOE'S DEATH
 by Rhea

 -----                                                           -----
 "there are way too many people who write today who should really be,
 like, accountants or something."                                
 -----                                                           -----

 you see, when you become Part of Something, (something BIG, man, like,
 BIG big) you give a Part of yourself to that Something and then, like,
 both you and the Something are forever changed because of it, -- like,
 for the better. you know?

 it's one of those things that gives your life meaning.like wearing the
 yellow ribbon during the Gulf War, remember? It was more than a piece
 of cheap yellow cloth folded a certain way, and when you wore it you
 KNEW you were a vessel for a !Higher Cause!, a plea for peace and
 victory and oil and pie. All this was wrapped up in one piece of cheap
 yellow cloth and it was amazing! It was symbolism! 

          But wait...

              My only regret is that I never progressed enough in
              my t-file writing to produce text-based drawings.  
              

          But
              it isn't over for me, is it? Is this the end? No more 
              t-file writing for Rhea? Yes, maybe, oh well.  
 
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Hahaha! 
                             [             ] 
                            [               ]    / 
                            [   0       0   ]   / 
                            [               ]  / 
                            [       ^       ] / 
   (hell we all gotta       [  (_       _)  ]          start somewhere)

                              still i never 
                              knew it would 
                              end like this  
                                    . 
  
 I don't remember what the first HOE file I read ever was. I know, 
 though, that my first impressions of HOE ever were set by whichever 
 "Reflecks" file i read first, a tale of karaoke, Quarex's thing about 
 falling in love with a girl on a bench, and, um, some file I forget 
 all about except something about realizing that people feared nuclear 
 death in the 80's? If I could remember then find then read (see how 
 these chains of events work) the file then I'd be able to describe it 
 less vaguely. But some things will just be LOST FOREVER. (like 
 Paradise, man. Like Paradise.) 
 
 And then there was Gnosis. And then what? These HOE-memory-Chains are 
 tangled but I guess I eventually started reading everything, not just 
 random things, and then, 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
                         THEN 
 
 well, then I thought about actually Writing For HOE myself! 
 
 And then I did. 
 ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I did. 
 And the Rest Is History --  because it's all history now.

                                                 ) 

    What does it MEAN to be "HOE 4 LIPHE," anyway? 
    Is it like when you cut your forearm with a big 
    hunting knife and then have your best buddy cut his 
    too and then clasp arms together tightly over a 
    campfire, while you watch your co-mingled blood drip 
    into the flames? Is it like that?  
 
    Cause that's, like, SYMBOLISM, man. And symbolism 
    is powerful stuff, you know; it bonds people together 
    more tightly than chains. It's like the yellow ribbon! 
    God Bless America! 

        I'm sorry, it just makes me a little sad, that's all. So Much To
 Learn, So Little Time. But I am changed forever, you see, because I 
 never used random capital letters for Sarcastic Emphasis before, and 
 now I do. I don't know how it happened, but it did. Say I was starving
 for a style. I didn't know it, but deep down inside me I was saying to
 myself, "Gee! My writing is sure boring! Gee! I sure am boring! Gee!
 I sure am hungry for a style!"

        So when I come across HOE my FATE was SEALED. I was Influenced.
 It's kind of funny how it worked out -- and god knows I don't want to keep
 this style I'm using now, oh no.  But hell, it's something. I am Glad.
 No regrets, baby. No regrets. 
 
 Sooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 So I gotta protect my oil reserves now, gotta watch my co-mingled blood 
 run into the sand and -- 
 
              OH FUCK OH GOD WHAT IF YOUR BLOOD IS 
              CONTAMINATED! OH SHIT OH GOD WHAT IF 
              IT WAS CONTAMINATED WITH AIDS! OH MY 
              FUCKING GOD JESUS SHIT WHAT IF I GET 
              GET AIDS AND DIE!!!! SHIT SHIT SHIT!
              FUCK WHY DID I MAKE THAT CUT OH THIS
              IS THE END I KNOW I HAVE AIDS OH GOD
              OH FUCK OH GOD FUCK OH YES I'M DEAD. 
 
 I think I have matured greatly as a writer because of HOE.  
  
               (i don't want to die!! Mom i don't 
               want to die i just joined the army 
               cause i didnt want to go to school 
               and now they done stuck me in this 
               desert and Ma i miss your pie lots 
               and sadam hussein is gonna get his 
               towel-heads to kill me!! help!!!!) 
  
 I will press HOE deep to my breast and treasure it always, always always. 
 
 At least I will have died for my country, for ma's apple pie and 
 for freedom from that commie bastard sadam hussein, and whenever 
 I look at my forearm and see the scar I'll know and remember our 
 friendship forever, and how our blood dripped into the fire... 
 
              ...drip drip drip into the fire below 
              the dancing fire below, the beautiful 
              entrancing dancing fire below, drip-- 
 
              -- MmMMmm!!@! Let's make s'mores!@!#! 
 
              Hehehehe I get to shoot a cool gun!!@

               ____ 

        ...So maybe not everything in HOE was good, Good, or "Good."
 That's okay. I learned from all the good files, but I also learned from
 the crappy ones, especially my own. Yes, I will miss HOE. I only knew it 
 for a very short time, but no regrets, baby. No regrets. If we part, 
 we part with a smile and we don't look back, okay, honey? You may not 
 miss me but I will miss you and maybe someday we'll both look back on 
 these days and laugh at ourselves and maybe we'll shed a tear or two. 
 
 Or maybe not. 
 
 But no matter what, man, I promise to wear my yellow ribbon with 
 pride. The Gulf War was just a war and there's always Georgie JR now 
 to keep the pride goin', so SO SO SO SO sew your buttons and good luck 
 in life and love and when you die, chop me up and spit me out and 
 WHOAHHHHHH that's a little strange there don't you think heh!@# Ow! 

 "A gentleman ought at all times to exercise a great control over that
 itch for writing which sometimes attacks us, and should keep a tight
 rein over the strong propensity which one has to display such
 amusements; in the frequent anxiety to show their productions, people
 are frequently exposed to act a very foolish part." 

  Well. That about sums it up, eh? Let the end be the end already.

 Everyone always says, "Oh! Come on! Write something! It's fun! It's
 creative! I like what you write, honest!"  Well, I think I should let you
 in on a little secret.

 I used to try to be deep, but I decided it isn't worth it.  It's a lot more
 fun to care about nothing but video games and wrestling and Pokemon.  I
 don't really care about your pressing social issues.  I don't care about
 your moral philosophies, or your political babble.  I just think it's all
 a big joke.

 Anything I write is just to watch all the art fags analyze it.  I like to
 watch them say, "Oh!  This poem means he can't express his feelings to the
 girl he loves!  This angsty little piece of prose shows his feelings of
 alienation from his peers!"  None of it is really true.  I just write total
 babble, to watch you try to find meaning in it.  It means about as much as
 trying to find patterns in the poop a monkey throws at the wall.

 "You're just full of angst!  Even this pathetic piece of commentary is
 just you trying to overcome your feelings of inferiority, because you
 can't be a REAL writer, like the rest of us!" Nothing is funnier than
 people who take themselves too seriously. Thanks for the laughs.

 :: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::

        QUESTION TO PONDER AT THIS JUNCTURE:

                Are "random thoughts" really random?
                Can ideas and feelings be expressed beyond our control?

        If you answered YES to these questions, you deserve a snack.  Run
 to the kitchen and get a snack.  Go on... this file will be here when you
 get back, I promise!

 .........................waiting for snack.................................

 .......................why not put on some music?..........................

 ..........................have you given mogel any sex or money?...........


        Okay, well, so you're a cynic.  You don't like this ART FAG stuff,
 and that's obviously why you're reading HOE, right?  You transcend.

        That time old issue of poetry in 'ZINES has been mocked and
 attempted forever, and we thought we'd give it one last jab.  So, here's
 some god damn Hoetry.

 MAGNAMIOUS POETRY by Quarex

        You can all imagine the scene already; there I was, laying
 face-down in the dirt, replaying the events of my recent break-up over
 and over again in my head, with the single question "Why?" pervading my
 thoughts.

        And, of course, that has nothing to do with anything, and certainly
 nothing to do with these poems, that I wrote as a complete joke in 8th
 grade.  At this point in my life, all poetry sounded to me like a
 collection of completely fucking meaningless whining about the various
 unhappy events in an unhappy person's life.  I always thought to
 myself, "if these people are so unhappy, why not do something about it,
 instead of wasting their time writing about it?"

        Now, of course, as I approach the final semester towards my
 attainment of a bachelor's degree in English Literature, I understand
 poetry more fully.  It is a collection of completely fucking meaningful
 whining about the various unhappy events in an unhappy person's life.

 Thine eyes like candy
 Thine kisses like Handy Andy
 But that smelly cat of yours
 makes me wish I was the floor
 If only you smelled as bad as that cat
 'Cuz then I could take you and make you a mat
 For you, my dearest, are ugly and grey
 While your little cat is nearly okay
 And forgive me for sounding a little remorse
 but frankly my dear, you can go fuck a horse

 -------------

 How happy I am
 when you are like them
 And not like others
 because you are my brothers
 I've known you since birth
 you've given me mirth
 you stupid mother fucker
 I'm going to kill you
 Look out for the clown
 Look out for the clown
 He's coming to town
 Look out for the clown

 -------------

 Your Eyes
 like a stream of steam
 or like a pool of gruel
 In any case, you're fucked
 Go away

 MY BOYFRIEND IS HISTORY

 My ex showed up at my door
 He doesnt do this as a rule
 It was the 15th of February
 past a holiday so cruel

 He was looking pretty good
 but didnt have much to say
 He was returning my bike
 He can sometimes be OK

 I had left it at his house
 and should have had the guts to get it
 I apologized for his trouble
 He shrugged and said, "Don't sweat it"

 I invited him in for coffee
 and for a bite to eat
 He sat down at my table
 He was so polite and sweet

 He took off his denim jacket
 and was wearing a tight tee
 He smiled across the table
 and I screwed him 1, 2, 3

 I know I said I hated him
 and he's out of my life
 I know I said he broke my heart
 ...stabbed it with a knife

 But what's past is past
 Que sera sera is my crusade
 It's a bit of a contrast
 (I once wanted him spayed)

 Do you find my behavior strange?
 It's really no mystery
 There's been no big change
 You never flunked History?

 SCOTT BAIO DIED FOR YOUR SINS by Mutter

     L    O    V    E
     These are the letters that spell calzone.
     C    A    L    Z   O   N   E
     These are the letters that spell ... love?

     I've always loved you, Jeremy Pivan
       But why did you eat the ham?
       You are a dove
       Love sent from above
       But I've always been saddened
         By your severe obesity.
         You remind me of Bruce.
         Bruce, you are my mother.
              If wishes were fishes,
                   We all would eat tonight.

                   In a world where dancing was forbidden
                   One man had the courage to take a stand
                   In a land where romancing was not permitted
                   Omar, take my hand

                   Zanzibar

            Ken Cooney's Bizarre Abstract Expressionistic Poems

     Deja Vu
     =======

     Deja vu
     Is when you've seen
     Something before
     Which is deja vu,
     When you saw something
     You could have sworn
     You've seen somewhere else
     Which is deja vu

     I'm Dead
     ========

     Hey, what's this bullet doing in my head?

     H a n g o v e r ! ! ! !

     Old McDonald's
     ==============

     Old McDonalds had a farm
     EI-EI-O
     And on this farm he had a cow
     EI-EI-O
     With a slice slice here
     And a slice slice there
     Here a slice, there a slice
     Everywhere a slice slice
     Old McDonald had a burger
     EI-EI-O
     (And on this burger he had lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, hold the
     onions)

     Paper Airplanes
     ===============

     I threw a paper airplane in class
     Later that day it was thrown back at me
     It had an a+ written on it

     Killing with Guns
     =================

     I hated this geek's guts
     So I shot his A+ brains all over the place.
     I blasted out my D- brains on his.
     We averaged a C.

     Infinity
     ========

     Infinity
     Is a .... v e r y ...... b i g ........ n u m b e r.

     Afraid of the Dark
     ==================

     I'm afraid of the dark.
     So I sleep with my eyes open.

     Life in the Fast Lane
     =====================

     Cars
     Women
     Cheap booze
     More cheap booze

     Ode to a Mime
     =============


     Taking Drugs
     ============

     I'm not taking drugs
     Because if I take drugs
     I have to fry eggs.

     Humanities
     ==========

     Humanities
     Is a hard course
     In how to be human.
     It is especially hard for me
     Because I come from another planet.

     People
     ======

     There are people in front of me
     And people behind.
     These people are smelly, but
     Hey, I don't mind.
     There are people to the left of me
     There are people to the right.
     I can only wish they took
     A shower last night.
     There are people above me
     There are people below me.
     There are so many people
     That I barely have enough room to stand up and say
     "I'm a people".

     June 1999
     =========

     It was june 1999.
     The birds were singing,
     The flowers were blossoming,
     The people were walking.
     Say, what's that funny looking rocket doing in the air?

     F O O O O O O O O O O O M

     It was june 1999
     The birds were fried,
     The flowers disintergrated,
     The people were dust.
     Say, what's that funny looking mushroom cloud doing in the air?

     Graveyards
     ==========

     Graveyards
     Are kind of like resorts
     Where corpses lie six feet under
     Waiting for george romero to do a movie about them.

     Why me?
     =======

     I don't know.

     =============

     Sleep walking

     People look at me
     And throw peanuts.

     Ode to a Stuck Horn
     ===================

     Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

     Going Crazy
     ===========

     Am I going crazy?
     People say that I'm insane.
     I'm afraid of what would happen
     If I only had half a brain.

     Running
     =======

     I used to be a runner
     And I'd go on this treadmill
     And run every day,
     But I gave it up
     Because I was going nowhere.

     Laughing
     ========

     I just died laughing.
     I wasn't a good enough comedian,
     So someone shot my head off.

     Jogging
     =======

     If you're going to jog around the block,
     Don't bother.
     You're already there!

 GRANDMA'S HOUSE by Kreid

 there was teary mumbling everywhere inside her den, 
 among life machines still plugged in and operating, 
 ancient newspaper clippings of obituaries and advice columns, 
 teary mumbling all of love or grace.

 dad searching a jungle of useless documents and newspapers 
 for something of redeemable value -- life insurance papers, perhaps.
 i looked for stray jewelry that i could pocket.

 people kept showing me old photographs of myself found in the rubble.
 there was a can of yams in the refrigerator,
 which incidentally was the worst-smelling part of the whole apartment. 

 i found a soiled pair of panties stashed behind the radiator 
 and an indian-head penny buried at the bottom of a final mound of
 cigarettes in a cracked-glass ashtray. 

 there were pills everywhere,
 diuretics and dietary supplements.
 i couldn't find her morphine.
 she took it all with her in her final, most horrible hours. 

 i smelled like sweat and death from the moment i entered that house, 
 the heat inside was even more repulsive than the heat outside on the
 sidewalk at noon.  the landlord yelled at me because grandma's trash was
 starting to crowd his dumpster.

 "you're talking to the wrong guy," i told him. he looked at me like i was
 an asshole or something, then he looked like he'd like to break my legs
 over it.

 "go ahead, do it." vacant stare. "i'm an asshole! Break my fucking legs!" 
 he turned his back on me and went inside to yell at my family. 
 maybe i got the wrong idea about that guy. 

 "nobody does sadness like the irish," my father said. 
 i didn't change my shirt for a week after that.

 SUCKER by Kreid

 Your town was raided
 By injuns and
 You were impregnated
 In your colonic womb
 And gave Birth
 7 Months Later
 The fetus clawed its
 Way through
 Your ass-fro
 And was born
 With his brain
 On the outside
 Of his body
 Sucks to be you

 BELTS by Effy

        Oh, if I had a belt, what would I do, I ask you?  Do you know what
 I would do?  Would I wear it on my head?  Would I lend it to my friends,
 and start a new trend?  Would I tie together my feet and walk down the
 street?  Would I use it as a belt, and hold up my pants to keep out the
 ants?

        Oh!  But what if I wanted to *kill* you!?  I could wrap it around
 your neck like an early Christmas present.  Would I buy a red belt?  Or a
 green one?  Or could I fashion a belt of pine needles and prick your
 prickly skin?  I wish I were Santa Claus.

        Baby, baby, baby, what would you do if I gave you a belt?  Would you
 belt me with it?  Would you twist my heart in two with it?  Would you lash
 out at me in a rage?  Or would you smile and thank me if it were me belting
 you? Baby?!  Should my belt be baby blue?  Should my belt be you so true?
 I wanna be oh oh I wanna be a rock star.  With a belt.

        Everyone would wanna be like me, man.  Just call me Beltor.  I got
 belts to hold up my gym socks.  Belts to hold up my head.  Belts, belts,
 everywhere.  Flyin' through the air with wings, singin' a song only a real
 belt sings.  I aint talkin' about no cheap shit.  $59.99, unless they're
 on clearance at Wal-Mart.

        That's right.

        My miniscule tribute to our degenerating society.

        I just got home and I put on music.  In class today, the teacher
 took away my CD player.  I asked her when I'd get it back, and she said in
 the most impossibly nasal voice I've ever heard in a way that gets on your
 nerves the first time you hear them speak, "When I decide to give it back
 to you."  I shrugged and sat down.  The loss of my music in school was like
 a kick to the chest, knocking the breath from my lungs, leaving me shocked
 and feeling a sudden wave of fright. Of course, being so different from the
 rest of the class, I couldn't hang my head or show my true feelings.
 Music is my solace: my escape, my release, and yet the key to open the
 door to the only world that matters to me.  The note, the time signature,
 these are my best friends.  I listen to music all hours of the day, and go
 to shows quite frequently.  I am becoming deaf... my hearing has depleted
 5%, and will continue to do so until i give up my music.  But I will not.
 I refuse turn my back on the best friends I have ever known.  Just as I
 refuse to become a conformist and do as the heard does.  I have learned
 to think for myself. I have developed a sense of right and wrong, and I
 believe my faith in my music is all too right.  I am not self-righteous,
 for I acknolwedge and even accept the opinions of others.  Even the ones
 who tell me my music sucks, which is a personal insult.

        "What do you listen to?" I ask.

        "Mainstream, faggot."

        "Pop? The only thing they play on the radio? You mean you didn't
 go out and discover a source of music that really means something to you?
 Something you can feel, can relate to, interact with on some level, and
 even be made to think by just listening to it? Why am I not surprised?
 Oh that's right, you're a piece of shit."

        I don't write about music because I'm trying to be cool. I'm being
 a realist.  I have been segragated through music over and then again,
 solely because people feel a perverse need to fit in.  Who gives a fuck?
 Be yourself, and the other shit will happen.

 PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM ARTISTS AGAINST COMPUTER PIRACY
 by Terror Eyz

        i was talking to my friend about a band i just started liking. i
 told him to go get it off napster, the music sharing program.  i didn't
 think anything weird of it at the time.  that was always my natural
 response.  any time i heard something new, i would say "hey, i'll get it
 off napster!" and i always did.  to tell you the truth, i haven't bought
 an album in like six months, and that was with a gift certificate.  i
 get any album i want off napster, usually before it comes out, too.
 so, i realized something.

        "you know, it's funny... i like this band so much, i spend all
 night downloading their music off of napster.  i will never buy the album 
 since i have the mp3s, so they will probably not make another album
 since they got no money off their other.  heh, that's kinda funny."

        but then i started thinking to my self, "is it really funny?" all
 of these albums im downloading and burning and even sometime burning for
 other people.  is it funny?  these bands are never gonna make it.  i sit
 back and look at my collection of over 1000 mp3s that i used to think was
 pretty cool.  now i think it's pretty sad.  how can i call them my favorite
 band when i dont even buy their music?  i just pirate it.  am i really a
 fan?  fans support their favorite bands.  buy their albums.  tell their
 friends to buy the album.  what do i do?  i download the album and then
 burn copies for my friends.

        and you know what?  this isn't just happening with me.  you are
 probably doing it right now.  everybody is.  that's the whole problem.
 how are any bands going to stay around with everybody mass pirating their
 music?

        well, what the fuck do i know anyway?  i'm downloading Anti-Flag
 right now.  i guess i'm just trying to make sense of what's going on, even
 though i know it wont stop, basicly because of people like myself who
 don't wanna fork out the 15 bucks for an album when they spend it on gas.

        who knows, though, right?  maybe i'm wrong.

        happy downloading =)

 COMMENTARY by Trimmerhead

        Would the real slim shady please stand up.

        Would the real slim shady please SHUT THE FUCK UP!

        Soon to become the _definition_ of over-played, Eminem's song,
 "Real Slim Shady" has invaded the minds and the ears of many, some of
 whom, like mine, are ready to combust with the sound of one more "please
 stand up".  As if being played constantly isn't enough, but on every
 radio station, yes, I have even heard it on a country station (god knows
 why) just is too much and adds to the madness it created.  At first a well
 written song with a good beat and sharp lyrics with a purpose, has now
 turned your attention to the moron spinnin circles screamin "i don't give
 a fuck".  A simple beat that sticks in your ear drums with a whining
 sample that would be considered a type of torture in some places, the
 song has gotten way past the point of annoying and far beyond overplayed.

        lets take a look at the lyrics. *note: i was very impressed with
 this song when if first came out, the lyrics were well written and held
 a purpose, but not the purpose has turned to "top 40" and not by Eminems
 choice.

        yes. you have my atteniton. and thank you for asking so nicely. no
 problem. yes. i have seen a white person before..many of them. the only
 time my jaw is on the floor is when i saw pammy lee's cavernous crotch in
 there vaca. video.  and good for tommy.  Dr Dre. dead? is elvis, is biggie
 smalls, is tupac? next.

        i'm sure the femimist's love you, they wish they could grab your
 you know what and flip to you know who. cute, don't flatter yourself.  no
 shit you got a few screws loose, but hey so do I.  i don't want to know
 what's goin on in my parents bedroom, thats why i knock first.  why don't
 you dress a tv up like a moose then kiss its ass like Tom Green, now that
 would really blow a nut. i always knew what a clitoruis is. just never
 admited it.  hey...discovery channel is good lions and elephants mating
 (no not with each other). dalmer?  if you have to hump dead animals, you
 should have been in the same cell as dalmer.  i do have a reason why a man
 and another man shouldn't elope.  *lisp* whose gonna where the dress?
 (normal) women wave those pantyhose, and the bra and the  thong, shit,
 shake that ass!
 
        ok good...you are the real slim shady. good. i get it. yes, a lot
 of cheap imitation, but hey..this is the 21st century.

        will smith is still workin off of "fresh prince" (tape/cd you must
 hear...fresh prince and dj jazzy jeff, good shit) why fuck him, more
 importantly WHY FUCK ME?  i don't care about the grammy either. yes.
 weird. no.  no i really wanna know who she gave head to first and why
 wasn't i there to get a turn?  sure...i got the mp3. deleted it like a
 good citizen (ha) actually deleted it cause her music sucks my sweaty ass
 (man is it hot in here)  I'm with Em. on the whole Boy/Girl groups
 teeny-fuckin-trendy-assed-plastic-seal-skin-wearin-bopper.  shit.  i cuss
 like i don't give a fuck like you. but i find other means of venting my
 fustration. to each his own....definately your own.  and no. nothing like
 you.

        ok good...you are the real slim shady. good. i get it. yes, a lot
 of cheap imitation, but hey..this is the 21st century.

        yeah...a head trip and a half to listen to. i do have the balls to
 say it and right at my friends in my living room. i'm no rapper. but hey,
 i'm white.

        nursing home at 30? my kinda guy...(self ambition: a dirty old man.)
 jergens? no no no...lubriderm, its right in the name lube! come on get
 with it man. you don't need viagra....just get some good strong coffee.
 if  one of you cheap imitation slim shady motherfuckers spit in my burger
 i will jump over the counter so fast and shove that burger and the shitty
 wax paper i came in so far up your ass you will be picking wax out of your
 ears for a week. then i will proceed to dunk you in the fry-a-lator and
 then cover you in "special sauce" (its just mayo/mustard/catsup/relish/cat
 urine mix) i already know a lot of wacko's who circle in the parking lot
 with their systems up. what else is new?  i'm out of control! you're out
 of control! i'll show you how it goes!

        once again ok good...you are the real slim shady. good. i get it.
 yes, a lot of cheap imitation, but hey..this is the 21st century.
 now..at this point i am ready to kill...everyone around singing it,
 pretending that they are a fake rapper...yes thats right.

        i already fed my slim shady how about you?

        now. if you were at all smart you bought the Marshall Mathers album
 and realized that "the real slim shady" nothing compared to the other
 songs and have moved passed the repeatative overplayed "please stand up"
 I give Eminem alot of credit, an excelent lyricist and an amazing rhymer,
 i like his style, but its the goddamned little teen boppers who have the
 britney speares and mandy moore albums sitting on top of their trendy pink
 cd players while they chant "please stand up" as the real slim shady plays
 on every radio station across the country. they'll all grow up to either
 be vegelesbians, sluts or decent woman but the question is how many of
 each and how hard would you laugh to see Eminem wave his dick at
 Christina Aguilera when he wins his first grammy?

        now. please sit down. please sit down.

 Hey man, you got any headphones? I wanna listen to my tapes here, but I
 ain't got nuthin' to play 'em on. Kenny Rogers, Bon Jovi, and Madonna.
 Gawddamn, ain't that Madonna a piece of ass? And she ain't shy about
 givin' it up, either! Hell, I'd bet she'd even do a smaller person like
 myself.

 Heh, 29 years old, and I'm only four feet. Ain't been too easy, bein'
 small. But my mama, well, my mama always told me that respect ain't given.
 No sir. Respect is earned! And I think I've tried to be decent and earn
 some respect in my life.

 I'm going to visit my brother, back in Oklahoma. That's where we was born.
 See, I've got two brothers and a sister. Well, I had two brothers... See,
 I was livin' with my brother up in O-hi-o. He died though, God rest his
 soul. So I'm gunna go visit my younger brother, he's 26. I'm gunna ask,
 get down on my knees if I hafta, to take me in. Even though I ain't seen
 him in 2 years, he should take me in, right? I'm his brother! He can't
 turn his own bro away. What brother would turn away his own flesh and
 blood, on his knees beggin'!

 Hey man, you gotta candy bar? I'm a diabetic. I just looooove candy.
 Heh. Do you smoke? I smoke Marloboro. I also collect those Marlboro Miles.
 I'm gunna save me up enough to get the duffle bag!

 What's the matter, you don't like me, do you?

 Heh! Just messin' with ya! But seriously man, I need a candy bar. You don't
 have anything? Sheeit man, that does suck. Ah well. Heh, I'm cussin' far
 too much. My sister, she's got two young boys, and two girls. Can't cuss
 in front of them! Heh, I love those kids, man. I love kids. You like kids?
 They so damn cute! Coochie coochie coo! Coochie coochie coo! You gotta
 discipline children, though. Can't have 'em runnin' wild. They's gotta
 earn respect. That's my mama used to say... you gotta earn respect, it
 ain't given freely.

 I remember, when I was just a kid, even smaller than I am now. We went on
 a trip to Florida, my mama, and my two brothers, and my sister. See, I
 never knew my dad. They actually only my half brothers and sister. But
 anyways, so we went to Florida to visit an aunt. I couldn't have been more
 than 10, but I went to a bar. Gave me a Long Island Iced Tea, they did!
 Gawddamn! After that, boy did I ever acquire a taste for that stuff.

 Hey, anybody have any headphones? I'd really like to listen to my tapes.
 Awww, you'se all just not givin' 'em to me because I'm a MIDGET. That's it,
 ain't it? HA! Just messin' with ya. Can you buy me a candy bar?

 NATIONALISM by Soybean

	i am proud to be an american when:

	1. i listen to george w. bush's republican nomination speech and
           he says: "etc etc <former president> thomas jefferson abe
           lincoln etc and george washington, you know, WINK WINK, his
           friends called him george w., WINK" (i note here that those
           winks were not verbalized as one might be led to believe from
           the above sentence.  i'm quite sure he did not say "etc etc"
           either, but to be honest, nothing he said registered clearly
           enough for me to be able to say that definitively.

           there was also a point at which, toward the end of his speech,
           i was brimming over with certainty that his sentence, which
           began "my friend, the artist formerly..." was going to end with
           "known as prince," and for all i know, it did.  i was focused on
           establishing myself a psychic nexus with this prince of power,
           son of sam, coked-up carouser, and all-around nice guy (ref:
           salon article... hell, it's not up on the front page anymore,
           and i'm not hunting.  front page now reads "can drugs bring us
           closer to god?")... george w. 'shrub' 'shrubdub' 'dubya' bush.

           if i wrote down george w. bush's acceptance speech down from
           memory, it would read:

           "hey guys, i proudly accept this nomination to be president of
           the united states.  some other presidents have been thomas
           jefferson, some other guy, abe lincoln, and george washington,
           you know, WINK WINK, his friends called him george w., WINK."

           [crowd cheers enthusiastically; patriotically twirls their
           redwhiteandblue cowboy hats]

           "also, by the way, i eat babies!"

           [close-up face shots of women in the audience, tears in their
           eyes, while the men continue to cheer enthusiastically and twirl
           their americahats]

           "by the way, my friend, the artist formerly known as prince, has
           an uncanny ability to illustrate the gentle, casual, endearing
           rays of sunlight cast over the hills of texas during the sunset,
           the things that made me fall in love with my creepy demonbride
           laura.  thank you america."

           [crown continues to thrash about wildly, hats in hand, flailing
           those strange phallic objects in the air while shouting "BUSH!
           BUSH! BUSH!"]

           meanwhile, i like to imagine that ralph nader is still trying to
           coerce a young airline employee into letting him into the vip
           cubicle, to little avail (ref: http://www.washingtonpost.com/
           wp-dyn/articles/A30740-2000Aug3.html).

           ladies and gentleman, to the average viewer, ralph nader may
           seen like a common turkey.  to the astute observer, however,
           he is one smooth son of a bitch.

        i am proud to be an american when:

        2.  a few years ago i was watching a rented video with my mother.
            i'm not going to lie and say that i remember what it was, or
            whether i liked it.  i will say that i'm going to pretend like
            it was "schindler's list," which i have rented on four occasions
            but never seen more than three minutes of.  i know that is not
            what we were watching because my mother saw it in the theatre
            and only on rare occasions will rent a movie for a second
            go-round unless she was completely blown away.  this is all
            incidental, by the way.

            in the midst of schindler's list my brother wandered into the
            room.  he was staring blankly at the fireplace mantel ten feet
            in front of him.  out of his mouth came his immortal words:
            "you know this big sub sandwiches?  like, the ones that are
            six feet long?  how much do you think one of those weighs?

            "i have no idea."

            "no, really.  how much do you think one of those things weighs?
            they're pretty big."

            "i don't know."

            "i'm serious about this."

            "then i guess it would depend on what was on the sandwich."

            "just a standard sub sandwich."

            "i really don't know."

            "how much do you think a foot-long weighs?  just multiply that
            by six."

            "go away."

            "what about a six-inch?  you could multiply that by twelve."

            "i'm serious, go away."

            "fine."

        i am proud to be an american when:

	i should say that i _will_ be proud to be an american when i can
 get a kitten and name it 'mogel.'  i offered this naming suggestion up to
 jamesy but due to the unfortunate circumstances of his current apartment,
 he was not able to obtain the kitten, so if by some means i get a kitten
 before he does, i've got fucking dibs, man.  if jamesy manages to get a
 kitten first and is still interested in naming his kitten 'mogel,' by all
 means, he should do so.  in that event i will name the kitten 'taco.'

	trick!!

        i am proud to be an american when:

	this too has nothing to do with being an american.  i sent an email
 this afternoon to mark borchardt, he who was featured in the documentary
 "american movie" and maker of "coven."  he replied.  his reply was rather
 anticlimactic, but i've been having a good time pretending like this is
 going to be the highlight of my life.

        i am proud to be an american when:

	last friday, july 28, i played this trivia game at a bar here in
        kansas city, davey's uptown ramblers club.  it's apparently a weekly
        event, though this was the first time that i had been free when my
        friend, a trivia regular, had invited me along.  sample answers to
        trivia questions included:

	kraftwerk
	terraform
	captain beefheart
	robert goddard
	einstuerzende neubauten

        and then after trivia was over, a woman announced she was getting
        married to the trivia organizer.  this came as a great surprise to
        everyone, perhaps even the trivia organizer.  but it's happening
        this weekend -- saturday in fact.

        going to the ocean tomorrow.

 ....{why you are not unique, even though you are.}

 ....a dramatic political essay neither dramatic nor political, blurted out
 uncontrollably by liberty. er, jnana. trying to change my name and all.

 recently i've realized that the majority of people tend to walk around with
 a big stupid happy inner grin because they, in fact ARE UNIQUE. And they've
 been told this time and time again by feel-good hippie parents and teachers
 and sunday school pastors and that guy on the corner who smells kind of
 funny but is always really nice to everyone except when he's hungry, which
 is always.

 The problem inherent in this nationwide "i'm ok, you're ok" phenomenon is
 not that it is incorrect in its presuppostion that everyone is different
 and unique, but that people see this simple fact as an achievement, as
 something they have consciously done. I AM UNIQUE, write it on my forehead,
 give me a t-shirt, give my parents a bumper sticker, scream it from the
 rooftops until my lungs are blackened from spending so much time on
 rooftops because there's so much smoke and smog, didn't you know that was
 where the chimney-sweeps hung out and sang songs, didn't you watch Mary
 Poppins, don't you know anything?

 Every single thing that you have done, that has happened to you, that
 you've heard, or overheard, or didn't hear, or ignored, has changed and
 shaped you. THAT has made you unique. THAT is why no two people are the
 same. Two identical twins, who haven't left the same room all their lives,
 are different people. They may have read the same books, but one of them
 got a paper cut once. And that does make all the difference. We are unique
 individuals because of our paper cuts, not because our inner fucking
 "souls" are inherently different.

 When two people look at a stop sign, one might think "red" first, and the
 other might think "octagon" and another might think "stop" and another
 might think "sign" and another might think "fucking stop signs are
 everywhere and everyone's always telling me to stop more than they're
 telling me to go, fuck them all, i'm not going to stop, i'm going to drive
 down to the local fucking pawn shop or gun and knife show and get a fucking
 Uzi withOUT the damn Brady Bill waiting period and take it to school
 because YOU motherfuckers keep telling me to STOP instead of GO."

 So, please, stop pretending you're unique. Stop being proud of it at least.
 And all of you eighth grade goth pagan rebellious little girls, shut up
 already and learn about life and the world and common sense before you
 immediately give up christianity for the next, most hip current religion
 without thinking about what it means first.

 we're all unique. being unique means you're just like everyone else. ooh,
 conformity, better make a stand.

 i'm right, you're wrong. you could disagree with me and think for yourself,
 but that would be too hard.

 -jnana (not liberty, although she's still in here sometimes)

 {oh, and jnana is a hindu word meaning knowledge.. jnana yoga is the path
 of enlightenment through knowledge. however, without the J, jnana is nana
 which is a interesting little bit of doowop, from such classic hits as
 "Na Na Na Shoop Boop Deet Dot" which, loosely translated, means "I forgot
 the lyrics because of all this cocaine cause all great musical artists do
 drugs and I'm trying to fit in."}

 "the mullet burden" by alek

        he parked his car in a handicap parking spot in front of the liquor
 store.  all he wanted was a gallon jug of port wine anyhow.  the kind with
 the screw off cap.  he wouldnt be long.  the bottles with corks piss him
 off.  corks are fucking messy.  annoying.  fall in.  ugh.  he went down
 aisle 13 and got the cheapest one.  quantity over quality.  the girl at
 the register had a labret piercing.  he thought that was weird but she
 seemed nice enough.  she even had all her teeth.  amazing.  the port came
 out to 5.43 and he gave her 5.50.  she put the port in a brown paper bag
 and gave him his change.  he pocketed it then walked out the door.  a cop
 was writing him a ticket for parking in a handicap parking spot.  then, he
 dropped his bag and his bottle of wine broke and wine splashed all over
 his new shoes.  cops are stupid.

 ----------[Taken from Gop.Org]----------

    this hack has not been sanctioned by a political party or candidate. 
           welcome to one of the former main webpages of the gop. 
                         take a minute to read: 

	As my dear friend Thomas Paine once said, these *are* the times
 that try mens' souls. We're faced with the realization that the united
 states government was never meant to scale to the level at which it
 currently sits. It seems hard to believe that those distinguished
 gentlemen, sitting back in that dusty hall in Philadelphia, ever imagined
 a nation as large and as populous as our own. Indeed, Jefferson himself
 faced the first indicator of this woeful inability to scale when faced
 with the Louisiana Purchase. It came down to this great man, who had
 crafted so much, that for all their wisdom and caring and structure, they
 had made a country in which there were no rules set for expansion. And
 ever since, this maxim, this lack of foresight in men so far sighted, has
 throttled and crushed this nation in so many different ways. 

	George W. Bush would make a great president for those states which
 traffic not so much in deceny but bigotry. Not acceptance but hate. Not
 love but fear. There is no sense of human camaraderie amongst those who
 live south of the Mason-Dixon line. At least, no camaraderie for those
 whose appearance is not completely and utterly similar to one's own self. 

        So gays, blacks, latinos, and even women, (once they've been
 knocked up and sent into a nine month hibernation until they can produce a
 male heir,) are treated as less than human. They're not even given the
 3/5ths that slaves once were. Their manifest destiny is serving that great
 tyrant, the straight white male. 

	And don't presume that I'm unaware of how cliche that may sound.
 But sometimes, lord, sometimes cliches prove to be a great truth. And
 there is no greater truth in American than the straight white male's
 dominance and his Aesopian desire to keep it. I myself seem to be the very
 same thing as all the other swine who run this country. For a guy like me,
 a vote for Bush is like a vote for continued prosperity. 

	But as the scum also rises, so the sun also sets.

	I can not conscience vote for Bush. A vote for Bush is a vote
 for myself. A vote for Bush is a vote for myself at the expense of
 everyone else living in this strange and savage land. For whatever reason,
 be it upbringing, my parents, or perhaps even brain damage, I reject the
 idea of voting simply for myself. A vote should be cast not simply on
 personal issues, but on one's feeling on how your vote will affect the
 whole country. 

	Voting for Bush would be voting for myself and voting against
 anyone not like me. We don't need to talk about the supreme court, or Al
 Gore's endless babbling about that tax cut for the top 1%, because like
 your fuzzy mathed lockboxes, it's seared into the American consciousness.
 I don't need give you reasons. If you can not see them yourself, then
 nothing will ever remove the blinders.

	Gore isn't the best of men, but I refuse to be stuck in the same
 arrested adolesence as all of America's luxury classed celebrities, who
 presume that you can only vote for a candidate if his views tally 100%
 with your own. That is the folly of the spoiled. Nor can I pretend that
 the differences between Gore & Bush are unpronounced. If you believe that,
 then Bush has played you as he wanted to play you. He's run as a moderate
 Democrat on Democrat issues. It amazes me that all you woeful cynics of
 the political process who don't buy the hype have bought the hype so
 deeply. 

	Bush is a man whose entire life has been spent in the shadow of a
 superior father, and remembering back to those awful days of 1988-1992,
 it's hard to imagine Sr. being very superior to anyone, but Dubbya has
 used the Senior as his prototype. He's the classic Oedipal, even if that
 does mean we must consider the horrific possibility of School Marm Barb
 having sex with either George. He's spent his entire life trying to please
 his dorky father, and once he gets in office, do you think that's going to
 change? He'll mirror Papa's policies as quickly as hate crimes legislation
 can be shot down. 

	Again, Gore ain't the best of men, but he's a good man, and he's a
 smart man. He may very well be smarter than any man who has ever been
 President. He's a fascinating intellect, and while he's a little to the
 right of where I wish he'd be, at least he truly understands governmental
 compassion, rather than giving it the thin lipped service of W. 

	This election won't affect me in any way. Either way, I'm going to
 float to the top. However, I comprehend the effects of my vote on the rest
 of the populace, and can not be irresponsible with it. I must vote, as
 dear self-aggrandizing Ralph Nader & his chorus of increasingly irrelevant
 celebrities have said, "my conscience". My conscience tells me that I
 shouldn't fuck over people over for my own self, nor should I maintain some
 lofty ideal of a true progressive movement when that self-same progressive
 movement can't attract any minorities or gays, and serves as the political
 equivalent of a country club for the spoiled and overpriviledged. 

	As such, I must vote Gore, and I urge you to do so.

        Want more? here's more.

                      computer intruder defaced the Republican National
                      Committee's Web site with a pro-Al Gore message,
                      MSNBC.com has learned. Along with a 1,000-word
                      diatribe imploring readers to vote for the Democratic
                      candidate, the attacker altered GOP.org to include a
                      link to Gores Web site. Links to other Republican
                      sites were also included.

                      AT 4 A.M. ET, the GOP.org site was down and it
                      remained down past 5 a.m. ET. But the content which
                      had been placed on the site was archived at
                      attrition.org, which regularly saves content from
                      hacked Web pages.

                      "Gore ain't the best of men, but he's a good man, and
                      he's a smart man. He may very well be smarter than
                      any man who has ever been President," the attacker
                      wrote.  "He's a fascinating intellect, and while
                      he's a little to the right of where I wish he'd be,
                      at least he truly understands governmental compassion,
                      rather than giving it the thin lipped service of W."

                      An operator who answered the phone at the Web site's
                      Internet hosting firm, Chattanooga, Tenn.-based
                      NextLEC LLC, confirmed the hack.

                      "We had people call us saying they were trying to
                      look at the Web site, then saying "Hey do you know
                      about this?" the operator said. She said a
                      representative from the Republican National Committee
                      called in the first report of the hack before
                      11 p.m. ET on Monday.
             
            'ARTICULATE' ATTACK

                      The attacker did not choose identify himself or leave
                      a typical calling card. In fact, one security analyst
                      said it was a bit more sophisticated than the usual
                      Web page defacement.

                      "This is another example -- much more effective than
                      previous ones -- of something that has been labeled
                      by the press as hacktivism," said Joel de la Garza,
                      an analyst with Securify.com. "The defacement is
                      rather articulate, much more so than the rantings of
                      most of the script kiddies I see, and seems to be
                      well thought out. It is also very well timed."

                      Security experts call young computer attackers who
                      deface Web sites using automated tools "script
                      kiddies."

                      The Republican party uses several domain names for
                      its site, including GOP.com and GOP.net. Those sites
                      were both still functional and did not appear to be
                      affected.

                      "We're disturbed by the pattern of dirty tricks in
                      this campaign," said Tom Yu, spokesman for the
                      Republican National Committee, suggesting the
                      Democratic Party may have been behind the attack.
                      He said the GOP was still investigating how the
                      break-in occurred. "We hope the Democratic party join
                      us in denouncing the attack."

            Bushwhacked! Hacker Defaces GOP Site
            Republican spokesperson considers it 'badge of honor.'
            George A. Chidi Jr., IDG News Service
            Tuesday, November 07, 2000

                      Quoting Thomas Paine, a hacker defaced a Web site of
                      the Republican National Committee on Monday night,
                      replacing it with a harangue attacking the Republican
                      presidential candidate, Texas Governor George W. Bush,
                      and "that great tyrant, the straight white male."

                      The defacement replaced the front page of GOP.org with
                      the hacker's monologue around midnight Monday, the
                      night before the election, says Larry Purpuro, deputy
                      chief of staff for the Republican National Committee.
                      "We actually spotted the incident almost
                      instantaneously," he says. "We took it down and would
                      have fixed it immediately, but given the timing we
                      were, frankly, doubly concerned about doing things
                      right."

                      The hacker disavowed a connection to a political
                      party or group and identified himself only
                      tangentially, implying he was a white male who
                      "seem(s) to be the very same thing as all the other
                      swine who run this country."

                      "Gore isn't the best of men, but I refuse to be stuck
                      in the same arrested adolesence [sic] as all of
                      America's luxury classed celebrities, who presume
                      that you can only vote for a candidate if his views
                      tally 100% with your own," he wrote. "That is the
                      folly of the spoiled." He went on to attack Bush as
                      an elitist who "would make a great president for
                      those states which traffic not so much in deceny
                      [sic] but bigotry."

                      With references to Jefferson's acquisition of the
                      Louisiana Purchase and the "Aesopian desire" for
                      white men to keep power, the writing seems to point
                      to an older, better educated (if grammatically
                      uninspired) class of hacker than the "script-kiddies"
                      using prefabricated tools to break into Web sites to
                      leave virtual graffiti.

                      Purpuro puts the incident in the same category as
                      other recent events of "hacktivism"--the use of
                      computer hacking to spread a political message.
                      "Given the hack attacks at the Israeli Defense
                      Force's site, and Yahoo, and the Pentagon, we
                      expected to be the subject of Net terrorism," he says.
                      "It's the important sites that are getting attacked.
                      We actually consider it a badge of honor. We hope,
                      with some of the major [news] sites raising this
                      issue, we actually hope to improve our viewership.
                      In the end this could work for us." A mirror site to
                      the Republican National Committee's with the hacker's
                      text is preserved here.

           The Register
           George Dubya ridiculed on hacked RNC page
           By: Thomas C Greene in Washington
           7 November 2000

                      The Republican National Committee (RNC) Web site was
                      defaced on election day with a lengthy essay
                      impugning George Dubya's fitness for the office he
                      seeks.

                      "George W. Bush would make a great president for
                      those states which traffic not so much in decency
                      but bigotry. Not acceptance but hate. Not love but
                      fear. There is no sense of human camaraderie amongst
                      those who live south of the Mason-Dixon line," the
                      author says.

                      One might detect a few personal 'issues' of White
                      guilt as he goes on, "gays, Blacks, Latinos, and
                      even women, (once they've been knocked up and sent
                      into a nine month hibernation until they can produce
                      a male heir,) are treated as less than human. They're
                      not even given the 3/5ths [legal recognition] that
                      slaves once were. Their manifest destiny is serving
                      that great tyrant, the straight white male." 

                      "Voting for Bush would be voting for myself and
                      voting against anyone not like me," he observes. 

                      After detailing Al Gore's numerous assets in
                      comparison with his opponent, the author concludes
                      that he is, if not quite attractive, the lesser of
                      two evils, and that "as such, I must vote Gore, and
                      urge you to do so." 

                      The RNC has made a characteristically paranoid
                      statement in response to the attack. 

                      "It's obviously a dirty trick late in the campaign by
                      the Democrats," RNC spokesman Tom Yu told the Reuters
                      wire service during an interview. "We're disappointed
                      at the large amount of dirty tricks being played this
                      late in the campaign by the Democrats," he added. 

                      We're not all that confident in this assertion, but
                      the paranoia is familiar, as we recall from an
                      earlier story where the Reps interpreted a spam
                      campaign as a Dem dirty trick. Indeed, the Democratic
                      National Committee (DNC) Web site came under attack
                      yesterday as well. A notable difference here is that
                      the Dems didn't rush to blame their opponents.

  COPY WITHOUT AN ORIGINAL by Sad Jester

        We are based on the system.  We are inseparable from it.  Everyday
 we depend on electricity, cars, gasoline, maintained roads, grocery
 stores, police, telephones and computers.  The list could go on and on.
 We've become dependent upon these things for our very survival.  If all
 the grocery stores closed, tens of thousands of people would starve to
 death unless someone fed them.  The world would go into total chaos and
 society as we know it would end.  We are, as a result, slaves of the
 system.  We are cattle waiting to be enslaved, herded, and slaughtered.
 This, I believe, is the central concern of the Wachowski Brother's movie,
 The Matrix.

        Early in the movie, Thomas Anderson (who assumes the hacker name
 Neo) opens a copy of Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation to a chapter
 entitled "On Nihilism."  The book has a hollowed out inside.  This case
 serves as Neo's hiding place for "hacked" information he sells
 on the black market. Although the movie contains widely divergent themes
 such as Christ imagery, eastern philosophy, and Greek mythology with all
 giving myth and substance to the characters, Baudrillard's Simulacra and
 Simulation is probably the best starting point for a philosophical
 approach to the movie's content.

        In The Matrix, computer technology has developed to the point of
 producing artificial intelligence - thinking, free willed computer. These
 computers continued to grow and learn, eventually gaining total control
 over the human society.  Human resistance takes the form of a mass
 cataclysm intended to block sunlight from the surface of the earth and
 shut down the solar-powered computers. The computer realized that they
 needed a new energy source.  The most abundant energy source on the planet
 was now the human being.  Humans give off body heat, which could be
 converted into electricity.  The computers then started to breed humans
 for use as a power source. They were born and grown within gel-filled
 pods.  Nutrients were fed intravenously while their body heat and
 electro-chemical impulses were tapped to power the computer.

        To keep people happy in their mind and healthy in their body so
 that they would live as long as possible, the computer created a program
 called "the matrix."   The matrix was a virtual world serving as an exact
 sensory duplicate of late twentieth century earth. Humans in the pods were
 plugged directly into the computer network through implants at the base
 of their skulls. Individuals within the matrix perceived themselves as
 living out a normal life somewhere on 20th century earth, while in reality
 their lives were spent within a pod.

        In Baudrillard, a simulacra is "a copy without an original." This is
 the exact nature of the matrix. In the film, twentieth century earth is
 gone.  The real world is a nuclear wasteland.  Cities are left charred and
 empty.  Life on earth is only possible beneath the surface where it is
 still warm after the humans scorched the sky in resistance. But an exact
 copy exists in the form of a computer program. People are living life in a
 simulacra, a copy which is its own reality. According to Baudrillard,
 exploring this type of pseudo-reality is the next step for modern science
 fiction.  Early science fiction projected the pioneer impulse onto outer
 space.  A brief survey of science fiction literature from Buck Rogers to
 Star Trek reveals that older forms of science fiction are nothing more than
 pioneers fighting Indians to conquer new territory.  Nothing is changed in
 their world but the clothing, weaponry and the enemy.  While our planet
 still carried with it some element of mystery, so long as there was a
 frontier, the human imagination could project it.

        In the past, the new frontier has been outer space. This frontier is
 now over saturated and gone, and with it the older forms of science
 fiction.  Baudrillard says that science fiction will take a new direction,
 "it will be to put decentered situations, models of simulation in place and
 to contrive to give them the feeling of the real, of the banal, of lived
 experience, to reinvent the real as fiction, precisely because it has
 disappeared from our life. Hallucination of the real, of lived experience,
 of the quotidian, but reconstituted, sometimes down to disquietingly
 strange details.  The very world of the matrix was a "model of
 simulation" giving the feeling of the real, done so for the sake of
 maintaining control and reducing human beings to slave energy sources
 feeding the system upon which they are dependent for their survival.

        This is the world in which we live.  We work to earn money.  We
 spend the money in grocery and clothing stores; paying our mortgages;
 living as model citizens for the sake of our survival. We take money from
 the system and feed it back into the system, like cattle fertilizing the
 ground upon which they graze.  The film assumed that reducing a human being
 to a slave was an intolerable, dehumanizing condition. Neo is the Christ
 figure.  He has miraculous powers within the matrix.  He was betrayed by
 the Judas figure, Cipher, and he dies and returns to life.  He is "the One"
 who is destined to take control of the matrix and end it, freeing humanity
 from its servile condition.  Morpheus (the god of the dream world in Greek
 mythology) plays a John the Baptist figure.  He serves as a herald
 declaring the arrival of Neo the savior.  Most importantly, he shows Neo
 that he is "the One" come to free humanity from the world of the matrix.

        Within the film, the central opposition was between truth and
 comfort.  Cipher chose to betray his friends in order to be reinserted into
 the matrix and live an enjoyable life with no memory of his past betrayals.
 However false his reality, he preferred it to the harsh "real world"
 outside the matrix.  Morpheus, Neo, and those who followed them chose
 reality regardless of the cost and fought the matrix whenever possible.

        These are the decisions we must face in our real world environment.

        Recognizing that we are enslaved by a system is the first step.  In
 The Matrix, we as a human race identify with the copy - the matrix world.
 What does this mean?  It means that we must realize just as Neo did that
 it is not the real world.  Once we come to this realization, we will be
 able to break free of our shackles.

        The next step involves a willingness to sacrifice safety for
 freedom.  All of the film's protagonists took both these steps.  Is there
 something beyond them?  The chapter of Simulacra and Simulation entitled
 "On Nihilism" advocates terrorism as the means of "checking in broad
 daylight" the mechanisms of control.  But it observes that the system is
 itself nihilistic and can even absorb violence into its indifference, as
 does the human world.  Thus, to Baudrillard, the problem seems insoluble.

        This advocacy of terrorism explains the violence permeating the
 film. Does the film point to a solution? In the end, Neo has realized his
 identity and power within the matrix and has achieved supremacy over it.
 But what then?  Within the world there are billions of people are in pods,
 unaware of their true condition and not ready for the real world as it is.
 What would happen to these billions should the system suddenly shut down?
 The world is not capable of feeding this many people all at once nor is it
 capable of giving them shelter or a life to live.  Should Morpheus and Neo
 shut down the program and condemn millions to death? Is such an
 insurrection justified in the service of humanity, especially when the only
 alternative is to allow the system to continue, which is also unacceptable?
 What needs to happen is that the mind of the system has to be controlled by
 humans again.  The malevolent computer needs to be lobotomized and then
 controlled. It needs to be stopped from breeding more human beings, and
 those in pods need to be awakened, as they are able.  Those unable to adapt
 could be allowed to live out their lives to their virtual state. When they
 die, they won't be replaced. Within a generation the computer could be shut
 down.

        In our world, however, can human beings ever control the system?
 Do they really want to control the system?  Reality has a tendency to blur
 the lines between what is wanted and what is needed.  What is wanted can be
 symbolized by Neo's hollowed out book, something familiar and
 comforting but false.  What is needed is symbolized by the contents (hacked
 material), dangerous, unsettling but true.

 STORY by Raindog151 aka THE MIGHTY DAN NAGY

        have you even seen a bare tennis ball? an old dunlop ball,  fuzzless
 and hard from the weather and a thousand overhead serves? it's grace left
 long ago, the minute it left it's oddly futuristic plastic casing.  slowly
 rolling in lazy circles no larger than one inch in diameter along side the
 empty sports drink bottle and highly salt based chip wrapper.  rolling
 lazily without a care in the world, never worried about either being lobbed
 or bounced by a lonely child.  me?  i get the raving fantods about it.

        fantods tends to be the word i use as an adjective lately, as
 everything seems to give me that feeling.  i'd pretty much given that one
 my own set of definitions, never mind the britannica loons, sitting in
 their posh offices all day arguing about the Alan Read origin of OK or
 Okay or O.K., depending on your academics.  I can imagine them fiercly
 debating the proliferations of Orl Korrect and Old Kinderhook, Martin Van
 Buren's handle back during the 1840's presidential race.

        but back to the fantods.  i walk down the street and see teachers
 outside a school conversing with students and i get a crawl up the nape of
 my neck.  i watch three minutes of the six o'clock news and start squirming
 in the comfort of my own home.  everything is amiss.  the sugary
 confectioneries at supermarket bakeries make me run to the opposite end of
 the store, pretending to look at frozen food items, fighting off the
 shivers that are just amplified by the cold air that permeates the entire
 area.

        due to all this, all my dinners tend to be frozen foods.  a entirely
 macabre assortment of fish and beef dinners, turkey croquettes, assorted
 vegetables, microwavable foods of an entirely underestimated tex-mex
 variety and of course one obligatory frozen bowl of campbell's cream of
 mushroom soup, never intended as edible, merely the cornucopia of my
 neverending supply of perishable foods.

        did i also mention how the oven gives me the fear?  gas hissing
 silently until ignited by an ohio blue tip match. it has to be manually
 turned on and off every time it's used. exempting making the occasional
 plate of eggs, i use the microwave. i know one of these days i'll forget
 to turn the little blue valve behind the stove to the off position, which
 i can never remember if it's up or down, so i have to try to light the
 stove on both settings until i'm pleased with its actions.

        the microwave at work has paid it's homage to my frozen meals, just
 as i've paid my apologies to the people at work for it.  i can't really
 help the fact that these meals take 20 minutes or so inside the water
 heating radiation.  i've tried letting them thaw overnight in a thermal bag
 in order to cut down on microwave time, but i just woke up to salisbury
 steak and cherry cobbler weakly trying to fight its way out of the plastic
 covering.  now i mostly microwave it until it's just warm enough to eat and
 usually it's fine except if the meal contains mashed potatoes.

        have you ever looked closely at mashed potatoes in a frozen meal?
 they give the word potato flakes new meaning.  if you look closely enough
 you can see unique snow crystal shaped design in each individual flake.  if
 you looked long enough and hard enough, you could probably isolate the
 potato flake atom, mastering the universe in the way that people did before
 the electron microscope and periodical tables.  if my lunch hour allowed
 me, i bet i could change the entire face of theoretical science all in
 thanks to the people of the Swanson Co. in Camden, NJ.

        my bathroom schedule has gotten quite regular due to my food intake.
 i fall into an odd catagory of people, aged 21-34, who look behind the
 shower curtain every time i enter the bathroom.  i suppose i could just
 leave it open all the time, but what if i have company?  the fantods will
 appear again, wondering if they're appalled by the state of my shower.
 even if i did leave it open, you can only push so much to either side of
 the rod, and i would still be compelled to peek around the corner.  i find
 myself reading newsweek in the bathroom, trying to add normalcy to my
 life, happily find i fit into the 84 percent of americans that pours
 shampoo onto their hand, rather than on their head in the shower.

        finding meaning in the world has never really been my specialty, but
 always my largest need.  i get the fantods on those nights, and you know
 those nights.  the nights where it's much too early to sleep, but you're
 too tired to watch another rerun of some sitcom you never even watched
 when it was first on.  those nights, staring at the ceiling or out the
 window, with that one impossible metaphysical question in your head.  even
 if you do fathom an answer, another one instantly pops up, both just
 turning into more questions. infinite loop. the rott- en tennis ball,
 swirling idly in its one inch circle in the corner of the expanse the court
 offers, it sits there. infinitely rolling on its exposed seams, never going
 anywhere and that gives me the worst set of all.

 SUBJECT: Greatest movie of all time 

        Okay so this is probably no surprise because of my handle but I
 think hands down star wars episode 1 the phantom menace is the GREATEST
 MOVIE OF ALL TIME. It is AMAZING how it parallels the bible, though I
 don't know why I'm making an intelligent reference on THIS place because
 you are all so dumb ha ha just kidding but seriously, this movie is GREAT.
 It blows the first three jokes away.

        The first three movies get so much acclaim, and most people think
 because my name is Anakin that I like them too, but I DO NOT, I THINK
 THEY SUCK. Phantom Menace kicked ALL of their asses - I mean come on
 just look at the special effects. They are so much better, and they
 totally make you feel THERE, unlike the first ones that make you feel
 like you're in a theater watching a crappy experiment or something.

        What I hate most about the first movies were stupid characters
 like EWOKS and CHEWBACCA both just made so that dolls could be sold.
 The Phantom Menace made it so that every character was integral into
 the main story line - which was classic good vs. evil. In the first
 movies there is doubt which is good and which is evil, and I think they
 did that to be all smart and artsy and shit, but when you blur those
 lines you blur the likeability of your film. In Phantom Menace you KNEW
 who was the bad guy right away, and then you were happy when they got
 mostly destroyed at the end. And I like how they made the bad guys those
 robots that all looked alike, so you wouldn't get personal with them.

        Need I say more? The special effects people... just think about
 those in your head when you think of this movie. Do you know how many
 people were actually in the movie? I think like two real humans, the
 rest special effects! Just kidding! But you see what I mean, right?

        Anyway, I know a lot of what I said will only make sense to film
 people, but I know this is a board so I should express my views like
 anyone else, whether or not they can fully understand them.

        HERE COMES MY SIG! (That's a light sabre, assholes!)

 EXISTENCE: THE REFLECTION OF MAN'S ETERNAL MISERY
 by Kreid

        As I sit here, rotting in my own despair, I am confused about many
 things.  But one thing always remains clear: we are all doomed to die in
 the worlds of torment and misery that we have created for ourselves!

	Why must man suffer?  The answer is simple: because suffering is
 all, all is suffering.  There is no release, no escape, no alternative...
 to the agony we must feel.  Suffering is the very substance from which
 our lives are made.  It is the flesh and bones of our very existence!

	Some think that salvation will come with death, but they are
 wrong, oh! they are so very wrong.  Death is an escape, but no
 salvation lies past it.  It will only bring darkness, eternal
 darkness -- a kind of suffering that is equivalent to the agony of
 life... darkness!  Alive or dead, it is a world which offers no relief
 from the worthlessness of our dark, miserable existence.

	No, there is no light at the end of the tunnel!  The end may
 appear to be light, but it is really dark.  So dark, in fact, that
 it becomes light.  Like the apple that rots and is eaten by the worm,
 like rotting flesh, the darkest dark is that which is light.

	Yes, my friend, we are utterly fucked.  Fucked by our own
 hope.  So fuck it.

	Peace.

 The fight of the century: Cerkit vs. Preceptor
 by Hooch [5/96]

 the following is a transcript of a scheduled verbal battle that took place
 at the raritan computer festival between cerkit and preceptor. some of you
 may have been following their fight(s) on irc and on y0lknet. that's nice.

 rules:

 - no physical fighting
 - cerkit may not expose himself to anybody, for fear of excessive laughing
   leading to hospitilization of the exposees.

 -- start --

 cerkit; dude, you're a LAMER. not only that, but you live in NEW JERSEY.
         do you know what that means? you live in the SUBURBS. go mow your
         lawn.

 preceptor; umm.. have you ever kissed a girl?

 cerkit; if you look at that from a transgressive progression, then you
         could see the entire properties of that proclusive but yet
         provokative question.  if you see it from the Berhiem angle,
         developed by the late, but terribly ingraciating, Dr. Arnold
         Berhiem, you could see the immediate jocoseness of the question,
         and subliminally induce yourself to varied forms of lactose.

 preceptor; *laughing hysterically* hahahaha. you're a dork. anybody have a
            bottle opener?

 cerkit; <crying> please don't hurt me! my friends told me you were smaller
         than you are! i didn't mean to hurt your feelings, dude! i'm from
         philly, man, my mommie taught me to talk tough! what could i do?!
         i'm sorry, please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me, please
         don't--

 preceptor; just go away, or i'll beat you into a pulp you 5'7"/120 lb.
            pansy.

 --- end ---

 as you can see, it was a very entertaining (and at times, horrifying)
 affair that ended in cerkit showing his true colors.  sure, he may talk
 tough on irc (which is VERY manly and becoming, in my opinion), but he
 doesn't have shit in real life.  remember that.

 Thanks for clearing that up.  I think you may have inferred more 
 than I implied.  Seriously.  I'm absolutely, completely content to 
 report that the nintendo version stinks.  I mean, christ, that's 
 enough.  Look at the box - it's still John Romero's Daikatana.  In 
 fact, the n64 version will cost people *more* money than the still 
 potentially excellent PC version.

 "A Trip Through Life"

        It's crazy how we meet different people through others every day of
 our lives and although we probably won't see the person ever again...we
 just take it for granted.  And then if we ever do see the person again we
 just recognize them by appearance but just walk on by them because you're
 only acquaintences.  It's weird.  You never really see who they really are
 as a person.  We just skim by on what we know.
        I like to be observant.  Study a person.  Really see who they are...
 what kind of person they are.  I like to become aware of my surroundings
 because when you think about it...you're only going to have THIS moment
 once in your lifetime.  So why not savor it's every bite?
        It's crazy how you can meet someone and only talk to them for a few
 mintues but never think of them again.  But then some day you might become
 good friends, or have a relationship together, or really get to know each
 other.  You would have never guessed it'd happen, but it does.
        Like today...I met some Jon guy at Perkins.  Didn't really talk to
 him but just by listening to him, looking at him, I figured out who he
 might be.  I confuse myself.  haha.  He was kind of fucked up.  Hyper,
 nervous, paranoid, but yet he was one of those people that you could never
 hate.
        I sometimes feel that I know more about a person than they know.
 Just because I guess I think too much.  Way too much.  I sometimes just
 zone off into my own little world because I get to thinking.  Thinking
 about What If.  That messes you up.

 Subject: FAG DAD

        "Hey, son, how's school?" Sez dad, walking into the kitchen wearing
 sandals, track shorts, and a mesh tanktop, with all of his body hair shaved
 off.  "Fine, Dad," says the son, while he thinks inwardly "dad sucks dicks.
 think about it. i come from a man, i mean from a woman, and the rest one
 little semen that outlived all the others in its burst node, but the guy
 likes a big dick! in his mouth!" then the son pretends to eat, having
 finished thinking for the moment.  "hey son," says the dad, "is something
 weird? something you don't want to discuss?" Says dad, doing some balletic
 hamstring stretches... "because if there's something you don't want to talk
 about... geez, i need to shower right about now!"

        "kay dad" says the son.  "Faggot" he thinks.

        Fag dad in the bathroom.  Undresses slowly in front of a steaming
 mirror.  Is nude.  Traces a steam heart of mirror image curves around his
 head.  Looks down and seed his new dragon tattoo high up on his inner
 thigh.  Gets in the shower.  Considers playing with his asshole.  Gives in
 to the feeling beneath the steaming water.  The son is not welcome at
 school.  Since the last 2 years since his father had acknowledged
 homosexuality, and his hippie mother forgave the father, so they stayed
 together to raise the kid while seeing other people and being divorced,
 except men would not approach his mother.  They would, however approach his
 father.  just as the kid is going upstairs for his football fag dad opens
 the door of the bathroom.  Steam goes into the air and he feels the
 temparature of the room as being a lot colder than it is.  Fag Dad's skin
 tightens, at most points on his body.  The kid looks at him, it being kind
 of hard to get away from dad issues, fag or no.  Dad has a thin smile.
 His skin is flushed and rosy from the shower.

        "do you want a ride to school, kid?" hisses Fag Dad.

        "uh, not really dad. I'm ready to leave except for my football, and
 you're, you know..."

        "I could go like this right now," retorts fag dad, "they would just
 think i wasn't wearing a SHIRT!" and winks.

        "bye, dad," says the KID, and runs.

        Fag Dad stops for a moment. alone, in the house, he lets a lot of
 his straightness fall. Makes a skirt out of the towel.  Prances a little
 on his thin toes.  Plays with his tits as he walks, ruminatively.  Gets a
 belt and starts pulling it out tight and hard as he walks.  Meanwhile the
 KID sits on the bench, the kid awaits the bus with an empty, convict's
 face.  He see the bus coming from the left.  Sees faces in the bus as it
 approaches.  By the time the kid had boarded the bus and been beaten all
 the way to school, fag dad fought his impulse to have hot cock rubbing
 musk smelling homosexual sex right now.  Gives in to urge.  Gets out the
 phone, beep(7)... who's he on the line with?  Why, none other than THE
 BOYFRIEND!  And it turns out that THE BOYFRIEND has been doing the exact
 same thing in his apartment, in the 21st century anno-deadjesus.  Right in
 the middle of Salt Lake City Utah, both of them not only excited about
 porkin one or 'tother but also about the pretty, oscars and hammerstein
 vibe of the ACTUAL OLYMPICS which now anchors THE KID, FAG DAD and THE
 BOYFRIEND to an event in actual time.

        Fag Dad lies on the bed, face down among the satin pillows.  Thinks
 about this: spending 10AM to 5:15 PM in vigorous ass sex?  Tiring.  But,
 The Kid and Ex Wife are due home soon.  He dresses.  doesn't shower.
 Figures hey, he's got some rut smell.  Some other guy's cock smell.  Who
 doesn't?  The Kid was so severely abused at school today he took to
 sitting in the Janitor's Mop closet all day, calculating through the
 pass-fail math to see how much longer until they fail him out of school.
 The kid listens intently.  He hears the classes let out.  Walking, talking.
 Next class.  Repeat.  Between classes footsteps are rarer, usually adults
 or people on their way to the toilets.  The Ex Wife is happy about this
 family situation because she has thought everything through logically.
 Everything being done here is for the benefit of the Kid.  Why make Fag Dad
 suppress his impulses?  He is good enough to keep Boyfriend away from
 The Kid and her.  Better that the Kid have a father and a mother who live
 in the same house, and better still that he is learning something else
 too: that Fag Dad is his real dad.  Likes penis better than Vagina?  So
 does the Ex Wife!  Ex Wife sez aight, I ain't stress over Tha Kid
 knowhatumsayin?

        But now peep dis:  how the fuck is this kid gonna get home?
 He duckin up and down avenues, tryin an see who around.  He gets to this
 street.  Scary street.  Bad street to be on?  Sure. But there is something
 working to the Kid's advantage here. These kids? They SCARED of this here
 street.  Why?  Cause they know the people on dis street would str8 fuck
 dem up an shit.  Kid gets to the busstop.

        Ex Wife and Fag Dad sit together.  They talk about business a lot,
 personal matters, fashion, popular psychology and home care. Fag Dad is
 wearing designer blue jeans, a five hundred dollar plaid button down and
 the same sandals he was wearing before. Sometimes Fag Dad will reach
 forward with his index finger and touch the top of the knee of the wife in
 a way that is removed of sexuality. Waitin for the kid, mostly. They didn't
 have to wait much longer.

 KEVIN SMITH MOVIES FOR DUMMIES by Linear

        Wait!  Before you read this file, although I reccomend you avoid
 reading it at all, you should go out and rent/buy the four Kevin Smith
 movies - the four movies which were written/directed/acted in by Kevin
 Smith - unless you have already seen these four movies, and remember them
 pretty well. Be sure to watch these movies in the order they were made,
 simply for nostalgic purposes. By the way, the four movies, and the order
 in which they were made, are as follows:

        Clerks
        Mallsrats
        Chasing Amy
        Dogma

        Now that you've seen the movies and have obtained an appreciation
 for the beauty they are, let's go over the subtle things you might have
 missed.  I can obviously not go over all these things, as I myself have
 certainly missed a lot of them as well.  I'll only be going over the ones
 I know of.  And of course, none of the conclusions I draw have not been
 officially verified by Kevin Smith or anything, they're just my different
 theories and such.

        Now, they don't make it obvious and spell it out for you, but it
 doesn't take all that much brain power for one to figure out that all four
 movies connect in a small way.  And with these small connections in between
 films is how I managed to come up with these theories. 

        As was already stated, the movies came out in the order of Clerks,
 Mallrats Chasing Amy, and then Dogma. But, much like the Star Wars movies
 weren't released in the propper order according to when they happned in
 time, it is my belief that the KS movies were also released out of order,
 according to when the actual events where to have actually happened,
 relating to each other (still with me?). 

        Although not released in this order, I think the movies actually
 took place (fictionally took place, of course) in the following order -
 Mallrats, Clerks, Dogma, and then Chasing Amy.  Why?  Allow me to
 elaborate!

        In Clerks, Dante and Randal go to Julie Dwyers' wake.  In Mallrats,
 Julie Dwyer had just died in the pool the night before.  Now, a wake
 couldn't possibly be set up over night (ruling out the possibility that
 Mallrats and Clerks happened at the same time). It takes at least a couple
 of days to get a wake together!  You have to make reservations with place
 that the wake will be held, you have to send out reservations to the family
 and loved ones of the deceased, and any other planning that might have to
 do with wake.  So therefore, if Julie died only a day before Mallrats took
 place, and the wake was already set up for the same day that Clerks took
 place, then Clerks must have taken place, say, a week after Mallrats.

        And that explains that.  The next conclusion of Dogma coming after
 Mallrats is a little more complicated to explain. First, to understand why
 Dogma had to have happened after Mallrats, and not after Chasing Amy, we
 must understand that bot Mallrats and Dogma actually never truly took
 place, even in the world of fiction.  They themselves were both works of
 fiction created by works of fiction... Now I know you must be lost.

        Explaination: Mallrats was a comic book written by the guys in
 Chasing Amy (Holden and Banky). Thereby making it a work of fiction made
 by works of fiction (Holden and Banky!). There is evidence supporting this
 theory given in Chasing Amy. First of all, the Comic Book written by Holden
 and Banky in entitled "Bluntman and Chronic" features Jay and Silent Bob as
 the superheros.  In Mallrats, they act as somewhat of superheros - trying
 to destroy the stage with various methods, saving TS and Broadie from the
 cops, escaping from the cops with super-human like speed, hiding from the
 cops using superhero like methods, and finally, playing the video tape at
 the end of the movie for Broadie, alowing him to avoid arrest and win back
 the love of Rene!  Throughout the movie, Jay says such things as "Snoochie
 Boochies".  Now, all this stuff alone is not enough evidence to say that
 Mallrats was actually a "Bluntman and Chronic" issue, but Jay's statement
 in Chasing Amy of "But that aint like us at all, all slap-sticky and
 running around and shit.  And what's that shit you got us saying......
 Snoochie Boochies?  Who the fuck talks like that?  That's fucking baby
 talk!" gives us more than enough to believe that Mallrats was in fact, a
 comic book!

        Now, where that proves that Mallrats was a comic book, it doesn't
 explain why Dogma was as well. In Dogma, there is really only one line in
 the movie that links it to all the other movies (besides the fact that Jay
 and Silent Bob are in all four movies).  This line takes place as Bethany
 walks into the same train car that Jay and Silent Bob are on.  You can hear
 Jay saying in the background something along the lines of "yeah, one time
 we tied this tubby bitch to the ceiling of a mall...".  This is the only
 evidence we have of Dogma being a comic (because they never really tied
 Silent Bob to the roof of a mall, that scene was in Mallrats, which was a
 comic book!), besides the fact that Dogma was all about saving the world
 and what not.

        Okay, this explains why Mallrats and Dogma are comic books created
 by the guys in Chasing Amy, but it doesn't explain why Dogma took place
 after Mallrats.  To explain this, we must take a look at the events that
 happened at the end of Chasin Amy.... they kill off Chronic (Jay)!  Thereby
 ending the comic.  Well, as we see in the Dogma comic, Jay is alive and
 well, therefore the comic had to have been written BEFORE Chronic died,
 thereby BEFORE Chasing Amy!  See?  It all makes sense now!

        Chasing Amy probaby happened anywhere from 5 to ten years after
 Mallrats, simply because they speak of the Julie Dwyer incident as if it
 had happened quite a while ago.

        And so concludes my Kevin Smith timescale theory.  Here's a few
 other things worth mentioning - In Mallrats, after being chased by LaFours,
 Jay says something close to "The bitch runs faster than Walt Flanigan's
 dog!".  This is in reference to a comic book that Kevin Smith once wrote
 staring Jay and Silent Bob as they are chased around by a dog.  Walt
 Flannigan's dog, to be exact.  Also, when the break Willam's concentration
 from the Sailboat Magic Eye picture, he mutters "Boobytrap!" all
 frightened.  This is the same phrased muttered by Chris Rock (Rufus) in
 Dogma when he awakes on the train.  I have no idea what the significance
 of this phrase is, but perhaps we'll learn in time.

        I told you that you should have avoided reading it.

 How to Watch Chow Lee Yun Fat Chung Movies
 by Water Biscuit

   there are many cheesy kung fu movies that have been made over the years, 
   and sometimes people watch them.  let's pretend that you have some 
   friends who do.  you force them to watch a movie you like a lot, say 
   _pcu_ or _ernest is important_, and they decide to force you to watch 
   one of their movies.
   
   it's a loud explosive thriller from asia.
   
   it stars chun lee fat yung hu kee ran.
   
   prepare for fun!

   the television on which you will watch the movie is old and dead.  your 
   asian-movie-loving friends are poor college students.  "bright red" is 
   the only color visible any time during the movie.  this color does not 
   include "blood".  so to heighten the enjoyment, perhaps you should bring 
   along a kaleidoscope.
   
   you will suffer from dehydration while watching the film.  your poor 
   college student friends with the bad TV and taste for asian films also 
   have no beverages.  do not think you will drink water.  their apartment 
   is very grimy, slimy, and slummy.  the water comes from pipes internally 
   coated with a sort of rusty, sooty, foul ooze.  so before you head
   over to watch the movie, you will need a drink to bring along.  as a side
   note, be sure to pretend as if you have a communicable disease while at 
   your friends' apartment, otherwise they will all drink your beverage.
   
   now you are prepared to watch.  sit back, read the subtitles.  in order 
   to understand the plot, imagine that there is one.  change your concept
   of the plot frequently, in order to explain each scene.  by the time
   the movie is over, you will have something neat to think about and you
   may have fun hallucinatory dreams that night.  or you'll be really 
   confused and ask yourself, "what's up with them asians?"
   
   the next step to sitting through a chow lee chung how sun lee movie is 
   very basic and is almost human nature.  it is known as "suspension of 
   disbelief", or "ignore the profundity of the wild gunfights."  yes, it's 
   probably true that when someone gets shot, their leg muscles probably 
   don't react in a jump, causing the person to fly over a railing and fall 
   30 feet.  and sure, reloading doesn't happen often.  but if it did, the 
   movie would waste even more of your precious time.
   
   for fun, you can conform to your friends by playing this neat little 
   game.  every time a character in the movie says something in english, 
   repeat it!  and if you wish, test out your chinese or japanese accent 
   while repeating!  oh, and if you are with a bunch of men, be sure to 
   comment on every single gun and every extraordinary explosion.  if there 
   are babies in the film, joke about the babies getting killed or thrown 
   like footballs.  
   
   ok, so now you're a third of the way through the film.  you are asleep.  
   the trick now is to have brought a pillow so that your neck won't be 
   cramped when you wake up.  be sure that your awakening happens after the 
   movie is over, or 15 minutes before it is over.  that way, you can 
   either avoid the whole dumb mess, or you can catch the climax.  the 
   climax consists of explosions and death in gargantuan proportions.  
   
   congratulations.  and my condolences.

        hong kong - wish you were here, weather is nice.

        welcome to hong kong, no hong kong is not japan. and yes it is a
 part of china since june 1st 1997 but no we are not communist. hong kong
 is now known as the SAR (special administrative region) and will remain
 under independant law for another 50 years whilst chinese law will be
 enforced slowly and steadily. has anything changed? of course, ever since
 the handover local chinese people have a slow growing grudge against the
 goverment (mr. tung chee wah) due to the fact that the economy has dropped
 and the property market has dropped rapidly.

        theres an old saying that "the ways of england are the ways of the
 world" as much as the local chinese would hate to admit to trusting
 "gweilos" (white ghosts in direct translation into english), the english
 did bring hong kong into being one of the top cities in the world. at the
 present moment, hong kong has the world's largest suspension bridge (yes
 even bigger than the san francisco golden gate bridge) although, this does
 not stop a local chinese from being proud of this bridge. its just another
 long straight road for "fay ge-is" (local chinese boys who drive toyotas,
 mazdas and have the engine changed so it sounds like a harley) to speed on.
 our airport here is supposedly also the biggest in the world, but rumours
 have it that germany and malaysia are trying to beat that one.

        now hong kong is split up in three parts, think of hong kong as
 three different personalities. you have hong kong island - the fun,
 sometimes arrogant but always trendy character. kowloon - the more darker
 side of hong kong and new territories - the naive, slow pacing and
 innocent side of hong kong.  hong kong island itself is made up of a few
 residential areas but in part mostly large skyscrapers bearing large neon
 signs of big companies who are struggling in this evil economic depression.
 kowloon is well known for its famous "walled city" back in the 1950's where
 a catholic Jackie Pullinger came on a mission sent by God. she helped many
 "huck sar woi" (triad) members quit their opium/heroin addiction and turn
 their faith to god instead of their triad leader.

        now new territories on the other hand, since it is fairly close to
 the border of china, many "II" (illegal immigrants) hide here. there are
 certain villages here that are named after a surname, and back in the 50's
 all the people that lived in this village had the same last name. all types
 of vegetables, fruits and rice were grown here, but ever since the new
 airport has been built on a nearby island, the new territories has become
 more and more of a residential area.

        now to the interesting bits, no matter what you read about hong
 kong, it may sound all glamorous, but life here really depends on how you
 live it.  the current population here is 7.4 million, thats alot of damn
 people for hong kong seeing as it is only a tiny dot on the map. money
 really does do the talking here, and if you drive, so does the make of
 your car.  like many other famous cities, there are red light districts
 here (oddly though the red light district in kowloon looks more green due
 to neon green signs) and unfortunately alot of drugs.

        growing up here is quite difficult if you are a local chinese and
 go to a local school. 5 out of ten children will be traid members by the
 age of 13, some girls will be used by triad members as prostitutes or
 "hostesses" in karaoke bars. about 2 out of ten will become drug addicts
 or drug pushers, 1 out of ten will die before they reach 16 by commiting
 suicide. rarely do children go on to universities overseas either because
 their family would rather they start work as soon as they finish school to
 support the family or the family dont agree with the western way of living.

        superstition is also a way of living here, old hong kong was very
 superstitious but since hong kong has turned more and more international,
 only the older generation carry on the tradition in some chinese customs.
 the dead are highly respected here, and most prefer to cremate their
 deceased than bury them, this can be of course due to the costs of a space
 in the graveyard.

        but on a lighter note, the night life in hong kong again varies on
 how you grew up, many westerners or chinese that are westernized go to
 "lang kwai" which is on hong kong island. local chinese go to "rave
 parties", but the meaning of a rave party has slowly gone off track.  now
 police go to them as well to keep the peace from rival triad members.  and
 every so often the US navy pop into hong kong and pick up a bunch of local
 chinese girls who find the masculine defined tone of their bodies highly
 exciting and go get drunk with them on the streets of "wan chai".

        personally, i have lived here from childhood to me teenage years.
 i'm considered local chinese but also considered westernized due to the
 fact that i did not attend a local school here. i do however get bullied
 by "fay ge-is" quite often, most of the time on the road. but to the local
 chinese i also look incredibly japanese (this might have to do with the
 fact that i have japanese blood) so for a few months i didnt get bullied
 as hong kong started to adore the every entrepernuership skills that japan
 had.  so instead of being picked on i got "macked" on, though i never took
 up any of the offers of "dating" a local chinese boy. dont get me wrong its
 not that i dont find them attractive in anyway, but to date a local
 chinese...you actually date them. meaning, for the first 4 months you go
 watch movies, shopping, dinner, lunch whatever pleases you but no hand
 holding, no kissing. hand holding comes in the 6th month, kissing much
 later. and sex? forget about it, well forget about it for the first year
 you're together at least because you definately won't get any sex from a
 local chinese relationship from the first year of dating.

        so if you do decide to come, please do because you're most likely a
 westerner and won't see any "huck sar woi" or have any "fay ge-is" bullying
 you, instead you'll get to pick your choice of 40 different varieties of
 international food, drink foreign beer and shop like a mad person on
 cocaine. the only expensive part of your stay is accomodation, but then
 again all you have to do is smile at me and i'm sure i could find a nice
 cheap place which is not "chung king manshions"...

 TWELVE LESSONS IN BRAVERY by Trilobyte

        lesson no.1 : just because someone isn't talking about something
                      doesn't mean it's not on their mind.

        lesson no.2 : the less someone talks about something on their mind,
                      the more significant it must be.

        lesson no.5 : attempting to pick peoples' minds for hidden or
                      missing information is potentially dangerous.

        lesson no.6 : people who seem open about everything are anxious
                      about something else.

        lesson no.7 : the lost cities of gold are missing for a reason.

        lesson no.8 : don't ride with drivers who welcome death.

        lesson no.9 : if you lend a helping hand, wear a metal gauntlet.

        lesson no.10: if a loved one gives you stickers, 

        sentiment is a ghost seen only in mirrors.  you can't touch a ghost
 unless it becomes tangible, but then it's no longer a ghost.  you can't
 pet a dog who's running away.  a parrot in panama doesn't want your
 cracker.  your grandmother's cookies were bought at a store.  an
 investment in love will negate your balance.  a kid without toys is
 killing someone right now.  you can't swim if there's not enough water.
 don't jumpstart the car if you don't know how to drive.  

        a sarcastic smile is a sadistic's technique.  throw 'em the bait
 and they eat the whole pole.  you can piss in the river but they'll swim
 away.

 THE GROCERY STORE by Rhea

        Jezebelle was a girl. She had brown hair and green eyes.  She liked
 ice cream.
	
        Yes, she liked ice cream, and that was why she was waiting in line
 at the grocery store on this mellow Tuesday afternoon, with a carton of
 vanilla cold in her hand.
	
        The person in front of her was a woman. The woman was wearing a
 brown sweater, and her hair was blonde. Jezebelle couldn't see what color
 the woman's eyes were.
	
        The woman was buying eggs, a pineapple, and a box of men's beard
 and mustache dye, in dark blonde.
	
        Jezebelle was buying ice cream.
	
        The woman had blonde hair.
	
        Jezebelle had brown.
	
        The woman was taking out a handful of bills from her purse and
 handing them to the man behind the register.  He counted them and put them
 in the register, and gave the woman back a few coins.
	
        "Thank you, come again," said the man.
	
        The woman moved over to put her things in a plastic grocery bag,
 and Jezebelle moved over to pay for her vanilla ice cream.
	
        The man ran a scanner over the bottom of her cold carton.  The
 scanner made a small beeping noise. A number appeared on the register
 screen.

        The man looked at the number and said to Jezebelle, "Your total
 comes to $546,232.50."
	
        Jezebelle blinked.
	
        The woman, who was still arranging her pineapple in a plastic bag,
 looked up.
	
        "I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?" asked Jezebelle.
	
        The man yawned, looked at the screen again, and said, "Your total
 comes to $546,232.50, miss."
	
        Jezebelle blinked again. The woman watched in silence.
	
        "Will that be cash or check?" asked the man dully.
	
        "Uh... well... yeah," began Jezebelle slowly, pointing to the ice
 cream.  "I uh... thought it... was on sale?"
	
        The man behind the register yawned again. "That was last week, miss."
	
        "Oh." An orange candy bar wrapper caught her eye from the aisle. For
 a second everything was blank.

        For a second the world was just Jezebelle and the glint of light on
 the shiny orange plastic wrapper.
	
        "Cash or check?"
	
        "Uh... well... yeah," began Jezebelle even more slowly. "I don't
 have that much cash."
	
        "Check?" yawned the man.
	
        "Uh... well... yeah," began Jezebelle, slower still. "I don't have a
 check book."
	
        "You don't?"
	
        "No."
	
        "Then I'm sorry, miss, but I'm afraid you can't get this ice cream,"
 said the man.
	
        Jezebelle sighed, "Okay." She began to walk away. 
	
        "Wait!" cried the blonde woman. She reached into her purse and
 pulled out a large wad of bills and handed them to Jezebelle. "Here, use
 these," she said.
	
        Jezebelle looked down at the bills. They said "Monopoly" on them.
	
        "I can't use these!" she said to the woman.
	
        "Why not?" asked the woman impatiently.
	
        "Because - well - because this isn't a game!" exclaimed Jezebelle,
 waving the wad of play money emphatically.
	
        Both the woman and the man behind the counter burst into laugher
 simultaneously. "Sure it is!" they chimed in unison.
	
        "What?" asked Jezebelle. "No it isn't!"
	
        The woman, still laughing, reached into her newly backed grocery
 bag and pulled out the box of dark blonde men's beard and mustache dye.
 "Just look!" she said, holding the box out to Jezebelle.
	
        There was a picture of a smiling man with a thick dark blonde beard
 and mustache. Jezebelle thought he looked rather uncannily like the
 man behind the register.
	
        Above the picture of the smiling man were the words, "This Is A
 Game."
	
        "See?" asked the woman.
	
        "But that's just a brand name!" said Jezebelle. "It doesn't mean
 anything."
	
        Both the woman and the man behind the counter burst into laughter
 simultaneously. They laughed and laughed.
	
        Jezebelle was getting angry!
	
        "I'm getting angry!" she said.
		
        "She's getting angry!" said the man behind the register.
	
        "Just use the bills!" cried the blonde-haired woman. 
	
        Jezebelle looked down at them. They were still in her hand. They
 still said, "Monopoly."
	
        "But -"
	
        "JUST USE THEM!" yelled the woman and the man in unison.
	
        Jezebelle slowly lifted her hand, which was shaking violently, and
 gave the bills to the man behind the register. He counted them and put
 them in the register, and gave her back a few coins.
	
        "Do you want a candy bar too?" asked the woman, laughing almost
 nastily. She pointed to the orange-wrapped one Jezebelle had noticed
 earlier.

        Jezebelle looked closer this time, past the glint of light from the
 shiny wrapper.  She realized there were words written on it, in a color
 that almost blended in with the orange shade of the wrapper itself.  They
 read, "The World Is Painful And Absurd: a caramel-chocolate treat."

        Jezebelle was suddenly very, very tired.

        "No, just the ice cream will do," she said.

        The man gave her the carton of ice cream. It was wet with cold
 condensation, and some of the condensation dripped off and started running
 down her hand. She felt the cold, trickling water well enough. It was
 real. She felt it.
	
        She felt it. It was real.

        "This is real," she said triumphantly, turning to face the woman.
	
        But the woman was gone. Jezebelle looked around wildly, glimpsing a
 flash of brown and blonde exiting the door. "Wait!" cried Jezebelle,
 running after her.
	
        "Thank you, come again," said the man as she ran off.
	
        Everything was so bright when Jezebelle got outside. The sunlight
 was so strong she couldn't see. "Wait!" she cried again desperately,
 shielding her eyes from the blinding sun with her arm. She could vaguely
 make out a dark shape standing a little bit ahead of her: the woman. The
 woman had two clear grocery bags in her arms; one had the pineapple in it,
 and the other had the eggs and the box of dark blonde men's beard and
 mustache dye.
	
        "Yes?" asked the woman testily.
	
        For a second Jezebelle forgot what she wanted to say. The sun was so
 bright! It was all she could think about. The bright sun, and the orange
 candy bar wrapper, and --
	
        Then she remembered. She held up the carton of ice cream, still
 dripping with condensation, and cried, "This is real!"
	
        The woman rolled her eyes and laughed. "Look inside, silly!" she
 said, shaking her head. She turned and walked away.
	
        Jezebelle blinked.

        Jezebelle opened the carton.
	
        It was empty.
	
        Absolutely empty. 

        A bead of cold condensation ran down her arm. 
	
        Jezebelle yelled in anger and threw the empty carton in the
 direction the woman had gone. It rolled a few feet away, then rolled right
 back and stopped at her feet.

        Above her, the fluorescent grocery store sign blinked:

                                Open 24 Hours
                                Open 24 Hours
                                Open 24 Hours

 From the lost pages of The Anarchists Cookbook or something like it comes...

                            WORDS, ALWAYS A HANDY WEAPON
                                  by Voyd (c) 1986
                                     
        Words without feeling carry little meaning to me.  People tie words
 and emotion together all the time when they should be seperate most of the
 time.  Most peoples minds are very impressionable also, so words have the
 ability to cause emotional stress.  Intelligent people have become
 somewhat jaded.  They see little value or wisdom in the words of most, and
 are somewhat immune to a verbal assault.  Not always the case, some are
 touchy.  When I say words I dont mean "fuck", although a simple "goddamn"
 is still like dropping a piano on the average christians state of
 well-being.  If god is so all-powerful, why is he such a pussy about
 name-calling?  geez!

        Anyways, story on that was I was at a party with a friend.  We were
 drinking heavily and started talking to a couple of girls.  We found out
 they were christian, and being agnostic as we were, decided to have some
 fun.  They hadn't escaped the years of brainwash and were gripped by the
 fear of god.  No basis for their beliefs whatsoever.  I was browbeat for
 20 minutes for saying "goddamn".  It was funny watching them get all
 flustered. "You have no weapon you can use against me".  I said.  "Your
 words don't affect me, and have no meaning!"  They got frustrated at that.
 The whole point is words can affect people deeply, yes, but I think you
 have just scratched the surface my friends.  Visual images may cause the
 most uproar, but words come in a close second.

 CASE #1: The Audible Bomb
 TOOLS NEEDED: Your mouth, a language to communicate in.

        I hate idle chatter.  Why do people feel they have to talk about
 stupid shit when they feel the least bit uncomfortable?  Places this
 happens:  the doctors waiting room, in line at the grocery store, in an
 elevator, on a bus etc.  You get the picture.  If I dont know you, chances
 are I dont want to talk to you unless I initiate it.  The following may
 sound a little juvenile, but trust me, the results can be hilarious.
 Keep a straight face, never show emotion in this case.  Seem distant, it
 will make people think you are psycho after the audible bomb is dropped
 (added damage: the realization that some people really are crazy.)

        Scenario: On the bus, crowded, had to sit next to a smelly lonely
                  guy.  His shirt identifies him as "Bill".
	  
 Bill: "So...ya headed to work?"
  You: "Yeah."
 Bill: "Sure is a nice day.  I'd love to be outside."
 Bill: "Playin' ball would beat workin' any day, huh?" <*lame chuckle*>
  You: "Yeah...I'd rather fuck my DEAD GRANDMOTHER'S CORPSE than have to go
        to work today."  <pause>  "Up the ass, no less..."
 <stranger turns his head, stares out the window>

        Things that make you go "hmmmm".  It's all about timing.  The
 audible bomb causes mixed emotions in people, some get angry, some are
 shocked, and some get scared.  This has lead to many "you're going to hell"
 conversations.  Hey...at least they aren't making idle bullshit chat now,
 huh?!  At least there is some conviction in their words!

        It's all about the total shock value of your statement in this
 scenario.

         Other examples (pre-assembled bombs):

        - "Man...I'd kill a homeless person for a smoke about now."
        - "I'd rather fuck an aborted fetus than eat at this place again!"
        - "It makes me want to kill my father and piss on his dead corpse."

        These are Great for tele-marketer calls and annoying store clerks
 that will not leave you alone.  Assembly of the bomb is simple.  Pick some
 words from the included material and string them together with some nouns
 and adjectives. (i.e., eat, fuck, shit, mother, dog, father, fetus, piss,
 mouth, anus, kill, lsd, dead, baby, god, fag, bloody, sodomize...)
 
        Set one off and watch the face of the next stranger that dared talk
 to you.  Hell, if you have big horsey balls set one off at work.  Just
 because you work with me doesnt mean I want to talk to you either.
 Bitches.

 THE AUDIBLE VIRUS
                         
        People will believe almost anything.  They work similar to
 computers.  Farmilar with the term "GIGO"?  It stands for "garbage in,
 garbage out".  We can take advantage of this to create a sort-of virus
 that will propogate itself similar to a worm.  Anyone, with enough
 conviction and a straight face, can be an expert on anything.  Pick a
 subject you know nothing about and strike up a chat.  Or jump in on a
 conversation you feel all parties engaged in conversation aren't really
 educated about.  This is your chance to inject your virus into the wild.
 You will be amazed at how little the loudest persons talking actually
 knows about what they are talking about. Our virus is made up of
 disinformation, subtle lies, and useless made-up facts.

 CASE #1: The Workplace (Petri-dish Experiment)
 TOOLS NEEDED: Your mouth, a language to communicate in and at least one
               human to infect.

        This is a great place to spread a virus because you can actually
 watch it propogate itself.  Sometimes it even makes its way back to you.
 Just smile and say, "Yeah, I read that somewhere."

 Co-Worker: "So, what's for lunch today?"
       You: "Plain noodles...I'm scared to eat a lot nowadays..."
 Co-Worker: "Why?"
       You: "Well, I read in California 20 people died from vegtables that
             had soaked up some chemical they treat them with."
 Co-Worker: "Oh man... are you kidding?!"
       You: "No...and those veggies were shipped all over the U.S., there
             is no way they can find and destroy all of them now."
      
 - Conclusion: He will tell at least 4 people.  Each of those 4 will tell
               several - and on and on.  Just *maybe* one person will
               actually research it.
 - Result: Many paranoid people at the dinner table.  A live disinformation
           word virus.

        Creativity is a must when creating a word-virus.  The more
 hard-to-believe it sounds the more people will spread it.  Make it
 something hard to research factual backing also, this ensures a longer
 life.  Believe me though...people will believe about anything.  From
 useless factoids that just waste someones brain space, to full-blown
 interruption of thought every 5 minutes thinking about it, to outright
 fear and paranoia.

        Examples (live virii).  Do not run these on your own brain!#%!  I
 take no responsibility.

        - "Hey, in South Africa they found a species of lizard that lives
           over 140 years!"
        - "Headaches are caused by gravitational pull from the moon."
        - "Al Gore accepted money from the KKK to fund his campaign."
        - "If you take a whole bottle of asprin you will trip balls!"
          (this only works on druggies...may kill people)
        - "They found a group of terrorists not long ago, that had
           stockpiled chemical weapons in four major u.s. states."
        - "It's possible to stay underwater for up to 20+ minutes through
           meditation.  The ancient chinese did it all the time."
        - "i heard [insert name] has testicular cancer."

        Now that you have this knowledge go out and cause some chaos, punx.
 Remember, as long as you are able to communicate, you are always armed
 with bombs and biological weapons.

                              HOLY SHIT GRANDMA!

        This is a story about how my dad had the shits, and i was at my
        grandmothers house one day, and i accidentaly saw her tits...

 kuzak:   Mom, what time are we going to grandma's?
 mom:     4:30
 kuzak:   ok, ill be back then...

 So, I went out to the store and got a hotdog and some gum, and the cashier
 was this chick, and she was like really hot, so i thought i would open
 with a smoooove line like, "Hey babe, what's your baud?"

 She turned and said, "hey shweeet child, 28.8--what's it to you?"  i said,
 "wow! too much woman for me, and then walked out, so i got home, and it
 was time to go to grandma's,  so i packed up my cd player, and some cd's
 and it is like 30 minutes to grandma's house, so i'm in the car and i'm
 listening to my cd player, and then i smelt something,

  kuzak: what the hell is that smell?
    dad: i donno!
  kuzak: jesus christ, dad! open the fukkin windows you fukkin pig!
    dad: why? what's wrong?
  kuzak: you fat bastard! what did you eat today?  beans and saurkraut?!
         what the fuk is wrong with you?  imma suffacate from the butane
         your ass is putting out!
    dad: well, then i'm not gunna open no damn windows for you and your
         wiseass mouth!
  kuzak: you asshole!
    dad: just go to sleep, it'll pass.
  kuzak: yeah, right.... why don't you sniff it all up for me?
    mom: god dammit!  both of you shut up right now... jesus honey, what
         did you eat today?
    dad: beans and saurkraut...

        Now, have you ever tried to sleep, and there is a horid smell
 around?  well it gives you nitemares!  so I'm trying to sleep, listening
 to a little _rage against the machine_ to ease my mind of the terrible
 smell... meanwhile, we pull into my grandmothers drive way...

 grandma: oh, you're here!  dinner's in the oven!
   kuzak: wow, what are we having gradma?

     mom: <to dad> stop it right now... leave him alone! you should be
          ashamed for what you did in the car!

 <kuzak sticking tounge out at dad, when mom isn't looking!>

 grandma: you better not stink up my house!
     dad: ok, ma, calm down!

 grandma: yes, of course...
   kuzak: ok, then, i'll be putting butter on mine, thanks.
 grandma: come over here and help me with the pots, will ya?
   kuzak: ok!

        Now, as I walk over there, this brillo pad falls on the floor, so
 as I was about to pick it up, my grandmother had already bent over, but I
 was halfway bent over to pick it up in the first place, so all of a
 sudden... WHOOPESH!  i was looking down my grandmothers shirt!  that had
 to be one of the worst sights i'd ever seen in my life!  jesus christ, i
 never seen the wrinkled up, shriveld titties in my life!, i mean, it was
 horrible... it was clear that i wasnt having a good day...

   kuzak: oh, uhh, grandma, you should've let me get that for you...
 grandma: it's ok, i need all the exercise i can get!

        Meanwhile, I'm like tramatized... you have no idea what that can do
 to a kid going through puberty! (btw: i was 14 when this happend!)

   kuzak: ok, grandma... i'm gunna go sit down now...
 grandma: ok, it'll be ready in a few minutes, deary!
     mom: did you help grandma?

        helped her? jesus christ, she sure didn't help me any... i could've
 done without seeing that, it was just as bad as seeing a fat person in
 spandex!  good gawd!

     dad: i have to use the bathroom... ill be right back!

        Uh-oh... this cud take years and possible fire hazard if someone
 lights a match.  All of a sudden, you hear "plop, drip, plopasdljkasdfklsdf
 klfasdlkf, drip drip".  i was like, "Oh man...!"

   kuzak: JESUS FUKKIN CHRIST DAD!
     dad: (yelling from bathroom) what?
   kuzak: you know damn well what!
   kuzak: i'm going for a walk... don't expect me back until this house
          stops smelling like shit-stained underwear!
     mom: ok, well don't wander off too far... dinner will be ready in a
          minute or five.

        ok, well i come back, and you hear "FLUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,
 clog clog... blup blup blup.."

   kuzak: grandma, i hope you have a plunger and a gas tank!
 grandma: what would i need the gas tank for?
   kuzak: walk over to the bathroom door...

        i have never seen an old lady run so fast... holy shit, she
 practically fainted.

   kuzak: hey dad, do ya think it is all out?  or is the shit gunna dribble
          out your pant leg at the dinner table?
     dad: shut up!
     mom: yes dear, that would be rather disgusting if we had to see that
          at the dinner table.  after all, we are at your mother's house
          and you dont want that to happen again...

        Well, it is pretty much all over now.  Dad's trots are gone, and I
 didnt look at my grandmother for 6 years after that.. and hear we are
 today!.. well until next time... cya..

        OH! I almost forgot to thank Ilsundal for the "hey, babe, what's
 your baud?" line.  heh! he almost used it at IHOP one time on our
 waitress!

 A SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM NEKO
 WRITTEN IN MAY, 1995

        i was about to start this rant off with a blurb about conformity and
 the like but then after writing about three lines, i realized that i wasn't
 saying anything new and if you hadn't taken the dangers of conformity to
 heart by now, you never would.  so, instead, i will take you on a personal
 journey, an odyssey if you will.

        let me give you a quick background on some stupid information. i am
 in the gifted program at school.  it shares a building with the
 creative/performing arts program, so most of my friends are in one of these
 two programs.  over the last school year, i have really become close to
 most of my friends.  i have done this through something not at all unlike
 the computer/modem/messaging world.  we passed a little notebook around in
 which we could anonymously (well, with handles, the same anonymity given to
 we the computer geeks) converse with each other.  the topics when from sex
 to music back to sex again.  the net result of this was me getting
 completely different views on a lot of different people who i had known for
 years.  this group of people decided that we should all still meet and see
 each other over the summer.  so, like the computer geeks, we had a con.
 the first one was apparently a success, because there were 5 or 6 more
 throughout the summer, each held at an area park.

        my friends are probably some of the most boring people i know.  in
 many cases, they really aren't often 'fun' to be around.  they are always
 depressed about one thing or another.  many of them are always talking
 about nine inch nails (something i despise and have made it known) and how
 their parents are restricting them too much.  all of the bullshit makes me
 sick. and if they aren't doing that, they're off smoking weed or thinking
 how cool it would be if they were smoking weed.  many of my friends smoke
 cigarretes.  many of them say how they're trying to quit and then proceed
 to smoke three cigarretes in the time i spend with them.  how can the
 people i call friends make me so upset?  probably because i do not indulge
 in the 'sex and drugs' atmosphere that they do.  and you know what, i
 think i have a better time than they do.

        outside of never having smoked a cigarrete, pot, drank a beer, had
 sex, something that seperates me from my friends is that i know how to say
 'no'.  now i know you thought this was complete bullshit when you were in
 the second grade and your teachers told you to say no to drugs, but i am
 serious.  the most important word in the english language is no.  when
 someone offers you pot, you don't have to say 'yEaH d00D! h0oK mE uP'.
 the choice is always open to say no.  if it's your friend who is doing the
 offering, you shouldn't be ashamed to say no, they should accept you.

        why am i saying this?  i am saying this because i don't exactly
 enjoy the company of my friends anymore.  not only can we not agree on the
 music to listen to, but too many of them have stopped thinking about what
 they're doing.  too many of them want to smoke weed just because other
 people are doing it.  too many of them are turning into the conformists
 they claim to dislike so much.

        and now the cheesy finale.
     
        look: you are you.  it doesn't matter what you do in life, because
 you are still you.  the only person whose opinion on the way you are truly
 matters is your own.  if you want to smoke weed, or do something else that
 i have called stupid, be my guest.  i cannot stop you.  but please, think
 about what you're doing and make sure that it is what you want to be doing.
 make sure that whatever you do is what you want yourself to do and not what
 someone else wants you to do.  make sure you're doing it because you want
 to and not because someone else wants you to.
     
        please.  i have seen too many people's lives get fucked up.  and to
 think, it's all because they were afraid to say no.

 WHAT I SAID TO ABE THE COP by Alek

        smile!  you have coffee!  your gun is so large and SHINY and I can
 see my reflection in your awesome mirror shades.  you have a blue suit on
 and a MOUSTACHE.  I really like your clean, SHINEY cruiser.  and your
 MOUSTACHE.  your badge number is 213 and your badge is very SHINEY,  you
 must shine it a lot.  everyone makes fun of you because you don't like
 donuts.  you dont like getting the crumbs in your MOUSTACHE.  but, you
 like coffee.  I fear your nightstick because it is so black, huge, and
 SHINEY.  please don't handcuff me to the railing and beat me with your
 nightstick of forgiveness!  did I mention that I like your MOUSTACHE?

 Subject: DRUGS!

 Alcohol is safer, if you take it in small amounts...  I don't like to 
 Drink real Booze I prefer Beer, every Friday... Not other days...
 Friday's the PARTY Day...
 Hasch is also as dangerous as alcohol...
 I wouldn't touch LSD,COCAINE,HEROIN,CRACK,EXTACY,AMFETAMIN etc etc etc 
 the list is long...
 LSD is the worst, you can get really nasty FLASHBACKs.... Some fall into 
 coma other don'T...
 EXTACY, nasty, use extacy, be on a rave, with full clothing including 
 some kind of body clothing and mask or a hat... Too much Body heat, the 
 usual cause of Extacy Death...
 
 Of coz if all the Drugs around would be 100% pure, then the problems would 
 be less (maybe)... but they are so filled with garbage... Filthy Drugs!
 
 Last Friday I wanted to get some LSD, I was really Drunk... L8r on I 
 changed my mind... gehehe... Never tried a DRUG... If I'm gonna try,
 it'll be Haschis, it's not so Dangerous, just to try, but years and years
 of use will crack you...
 
 I like to drunk... Liked to get Highg, Dream: Being High on some unharmful
 Drug in CYBERSPACE!!  WOW! would kick ass...
 
 Actually Techno Music itself is a stimulating Drug... Nice...

 L8r...

 PS. W8ing for reactions...

                        How to Break A Bad Drug Habit

        If you are an addict of any drug you must take steps to change your
 life.  First, you must be able to admit that you have a problem.  This is
 the hardest step for most users because they are usually in denial about
 their drug habit.  Once you've realized that you do need help the first
 thing you want to do is sign yourself into a drug rehabilitation center.
 There you can get counseling and the full individual attention and
 encouragement that you'll need to recover.  Next, you might want to join a
 support group such as Narcotics Anonymous.  They can help you learn how to
 manage and enjoy your own life, teach you the twelve steps, and always be
 there if you ever need them.  Also it is always healthy to have friends
 and family members who will be there to support you and motivate you on
 your way to serenity.  Another good idea is to keep yourself occupied.
 You should look into schools, get a full time job or pick up a hobby such
 as, painting, sports, horseback riding or whatever you like doing.  During
 all this there are certain things you need to avoid like the people you
 hung out with when you have used, the places you used to go when you would
 use, or anything you associate with using drugs.  Following these three
 simple suggestions will make it easier for you not to relapse.  Finally
 the best thing for you to do is to keep at it one day at a time.  For
 instance, don't think about a month from now or two weeks ago, just keep
 your thoughts in today and what is going on right now.  Just remember that
 you have already hurt yourself enough.  Is there any good reason to hurt
 yourself anymore?

                             "The Trip Club"
                                By: Z
                              Written 03/94
                 -----------------------------------------

        Josh was a regulare teenager... He was into the regular things like
 cars, drugs, and women.  Josh was about 5 feet, 9 inches tall, and he had
 his own clique.  They would hang out, and talk.  Every once in a while, a
 friend would be stonned when they met at the Caffeteria, which was usually
 where they all saw each other.  It would be real fun... they would always
 play some sorta trick on the member who was messed up.  For instance, once,
 Mark, one of Josh's best buds came in totally out of it.  He looked and
 smelled it.  It was finally the time everyone had been waiting for... the
 ultimate trick.  Mark fell fast asleep on the dirty caffeteria, with
 dribble coming out of his mouth.  He must have really been hitting on the
 pills for that sort of effect.

        The group, that numbered 4, pulled Mark into the theater in their
 school.  They had been planning this for some time, do they had some props
 hidden backstage.  They one by one went back and retrieved the uniforms,
 swords, dry ice, and other essentials for the trick.  They had a coffin in
 the middle of the stage.  It had no lid, and they placed Marks semi-Cold
 body into it.  They turned off all of the lights except the stage ones,
 and put out the buckets of dry-ice.  The stole the speakers platform and
 quickly go to work spray painting it black.  The stage was set.  All that
 needed to be done, was for Mark to wake up.  

        They waited over an hour for Mark's body to re-awaken.. when they
 began to get scared.  "What if he is dead?", they group thought
 collectively.  Well, they waited and waited, and finally, Mark began to
 wake up.

                ---------------------------------
                The Scene [From Mark's View]:
                Mark in the center of a lightened
                misty, cloudy area, surrounded by
                dark nothingness, with a man sta-
                nding at a desk, reading from a 
                book.
                ---------------------------------

        Mark looked up, and figeted.  Then he suddenly got really red and
 started to move.  He raised himself slowly and looked around.  He snapped
 his neck back to free his joints, and then started to realize that he was
 dead.  He went over to the man and said, "So, am I dead?".  The man
 replied slowly but sternly, "Yes".  Mark quickly replied with, "So which
 is is boss, up or down?".  The man replied, "What do you think?".  Mark
 then looked pale... and muttered, "Shit!". Marks life then shot across his
 mind like O.J.Simpson on drugs... He saw every moment of his life, from
 his first shoot up when he was 1, to his fist sample of crack, and acid...
 [Hi smiles], the cocaine [He grinns.. bad trip], and then finally, the
 pills that he had taken not long ago.
        Mark thought fast, knowing that hell was'nt the place for him.  He
 pointed to the man's rear and said "Look, its O.J.Simpson's ex!", and the
 guardian turned.  He flashed up the stairs to heaven to live an eternal
 pure life.
        Back at the school, the Trip club was still waiting for Mark to
 wake up.

 ARE YOU JUST ACCEPTING TEXT? by iNSaNE GiRL

        The task:  write a short story whereby all characters are no more
                   than their material realities.

 The response is: FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCK.

        haha... material realities folks...

        how the fucking donkey-mother-fucker-fucking hell do you write
 anything other than goddamn MATERIAL REALITIES?!  you tell me that and
 i'll give you a quarter in American dollars, coz we don't have those where
 i live fuck oath.

        We ARE nothing but material realities.

        to our little heads we can pretend to be three-dimensional and
 fantastic, but pretense is pretense, and why don't you all just lay down
 and fucking do stuff about it?

        Don't be so fucking crass and crude and bluddy plain rude, you
 asshole... how did I end up like this is what I'd like to know?

        One minute I'm flying, goddammit, and the world is a haze all
 around me--I don't give a shit--i just don't care, coz you can't stop me
 from dancing, you can't pull my wings off--even if you keep tugging at my
 legs like a whining child.  Fuck life, just screw it all, coz i'm on some
 kind of natural high and my head is like way up there where all the smoke
 and fumes from all the shit you say is just spinning round contaminating
 my brain with nervous energy i'd normally sublimate to happy vibes.

        all you wanna do is watch me free fall into nothingness, coz
 happiness is just a word that people without problems like to use to
 pretend they don't have problems.

        It's perverted.

        Even if you can forget, it all kicks you in the head early next
 morning.

        Do you want to fly with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee to a land where
 love is freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... man i could make love to music
 all night long, coz in love you lose yourself and it's no big deal when
 you never had a self in the fucking first place.

        i got a head full of nothing and a pocket full of glass, so don't
 you go trying to tell me that you understand anything about me--i am way
 too simple... i cannot be understood!  like the genes in my dna, i am
 unicelled and ignorant.  I am nothing but a reflection of a reflection of a
 material fucking reality.

        Let's all just forget about ever wanting to be anything.  Because,
 my friend, in a world where everything is outside, you ain't nothing....
 you ain't nothing But.

        I hope that watever you people think you're gonna do with my
 heart... you know that it ain't even beating no more... coz i dropped it
 over a bridge on my way here and it kinda broke on impact... hollow things
 don't hold up so strong when you throw them hard over long distances... i
 proved it through careful testing.  The results bored me.

        You can't stop the tears that ain't falling... fuck eh.
 Profounddddddddddddddddd.... i woke up one day and everything was clear
 and thats what happened man, can you fucking believe it or what??????????

        My mummy and daddy decided when I was born they'd teach me manners
 and they cut out my vocal cords cause a smile is more polite than a
 screaming child.  i pretended to go along with the mutilation right up
 until one day i found the severed cord, reconnected and turned the volume
 THE FUCK UP...

 TURNERS FILES by Trilobyte
 
   [to the tune of "national anthem," baseball games]

     (not the canadian one)

     (and heard underneath a whole lot of noise of people eating hot dogs
 and yelling at their children and at the players and at the vendors to "get
 more beer!   get me more beer!   more beer here!" and the like, and since i
 can't really hear the tune right n ow, it's like, i can't sing a long, so i
 just have to ask:

	"is it the denim or the mornings that contitute your thread of
 thought?"

	then that "tightness of the sweater", that old "jersey-rudie" type
 of nut,   

   (diggers of this fake table take fake fable note, sell only to bidders 
 of the highest, most smiley and bold),

 yells, 

	"i see t-shirts, all clad whitely, standing in a row, hair parted, 
 pants _undaunted_, waivering hith'r and fro!".  and that really
 gets your attention, 
        so i can't ask about the denim, dear heart-o-mine. 

        and then one of the baseball players replies, "to the tailor go the
 players when they hat has broke, order quickly at the Bixley's (where the
 playerrs go.) the 'owner's daughters' all have "problems" with her buttons,
 hear, they come right open for the basemen soon as they come near."
   
        well i guess it's true,  cos i've seen brochures for that region and

			principal mercury says, no grin on his chin, no
 "penny for your thoughts," nothing.  he was kind of shrinking actually, his
 hands clutching invisible objects in front of him as he cowered back to his
 chair.

	viewing that her husband was "perturbed", dotty mercury stood up
 from her cake-walk chair, put her hands on her hips, and,  looking around, 
 her fat red lips _pulsated_ as she substituted speaking (honking, more like
 it)  for loud, loud, LOUD gum chewing.

	[finger-pointing begins.]

	"who is the bastard who sinned??" she asks, to no one in particular,
 while waving her finger at the tomato on her husband's head.

	[gum-chewing begins.]

	a nondescript kid in the audience, who only seems to be absorbing
 the most darkness, raises his right sleeve and says, 

	"me."  

	[gum-chewing ends.]

	[finger points at mangled boy.]

	"well what did you expect from the whole ordeal, little one?  any
 thing less than to have lost your right arm in such a FREAKISH ATTEMPT AT
 RIDICULOUSNESS???!?," mrs. mercury continued, her eyes almost completely
 out of their sockets, staring at little tommy's severed arm.

	[gum-chewing begins.]

	tommy just smiled an evil little grin, eyes and all,  shook his 
 shoulder, and replied, 

	"tasted them termayters, ma'am, and they was ain't no good, i
 can't blame that little statesman or the stage or crew," he waves his arm
 billowingly.

	[gum chewing continues.]

	"they pilot shipping's been all flippant since the dailey screw, 
 the missing tailor and a jailor who look-a lots like you... bingo, dorothy
 friends come some willing by, when they's old shrews, they spark toward

	WOW, mrs. mercury looked bewildered --

	"that's to say the least," she interrupts me,

	"but to say the most, i look very, very exhuberant, too," she

 GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR ROADKILL is Effy OOPS I MEAN by Effy HEHEHE

        It was the Amish that pissed me off the most.  Or perhaps it was the
 farmers with their tractors and their large hauls of hay or shit.  They
 stunk up the highways as well.  Old people were positively infuriating,
 because they didn't even notice you tailing them because they couldn't see,
 or they couldn't hear you honking and cursing because they were deaf.  Old
 people can get away with murder, and not even realize it.  They're
 oblivious of their own evil as well as other people.

        (You know, I don't really know why I'm so impatient while operating
 motor vehicles.  I get incurbable road rage at times.  I despise people who
 have the audacity to be such a pain in the ass.  I want to get where I'm
 fucking going SOMETIME THIS YEAR, BASTARD.  And if I have to MAKE YOU A
 ROADSIDE PANCAKE to do that, SO FUCKING BE IT.)

        That was my first "urge" upon getting mad.  Actually, it was the
 exact second that I became mad, or perhaps it *was* what made me mad.  Not
 only was I angered, but I was mad, you see I was crazy mad, not just
 angered, but crazy, insane, loony, MAD, get it?  So, doing what mad people
 often like to do, I began to think about killing people.  Of taking the
 life of a helpless, poor, screaming, bloody, mangled human body of
 disgusting flesh.  Killing.  Murder.  Homicide.  I decided that it was not
 going to be any of the latter three.  Genocide was the best word for my
 developing plan.  Roadside Genocide.  It would be a rebellious, nation-wide
 killing tour.  Would they assume there were three rebellion parties; one
 that killed the Amish, one that killed the farmers, and one that killed
 senior citizens?  Or would they figure it was one solid movement, or at
 least 3 movements linked together by one larger, more solid movement?
 Regardless, there would be a movement, and a large one at that.  I rented
 a huge blue bus and put ad signs on it for Roadside Genocide.  The reason
 I needed a bus was for body collecting purposes.  I had full intentions of
 taking the mutilated bodies I had slain and burn them in a sacrifice to my
 inspiration, Satan.

        "Oh dear lord Satan," I would sing aloud as I pranced around my
 first victim, an old old lady.  She was so old, her skin looked like gray
 paper.  I wonder if she would burn up if I put a match to her.  She went
 up in flames like a tikki torch.  I decided to leave this one for the press
 and skirted off after dumping a few gallons of gasoline on the crispy old
 bag.

        The next day, the story was in the newspaper, you know.  'Horrible
 Roadside Homicide' and 'Homicide of Local Nun Leaves Police Searching'...
 needless to say, I was pissed.  It wasn't just murder.  It was genocide.
 They weren't getting it, the dumb fucks.  Don't you see?  I tore up the
 articles in a drunken stupor and carved in my arm with a drug needle.

        Needless to say, a day later I was pulled over by the police.  I
 guess some locals had seen the bus I was driving around with the word
 "GENOCIDE" in huge red letters on the side of the bus.  They were concerned
 for their children's safety.  Rubbish, I said.  As long as they weren't
 old, or farmers, or Amish, and were on the highway, I wouldn't touch them.
 So thus, I got my message across, while trying not to scare everyone.  But
 they were scared anyway, because everyone was an old Amish farmer, and
 after a couple more killings of those 60 year old pig bastards that pulled
 me over, I was arrested by a couple of hot shot criminal investigators and
 interrogated.

        "Why do you kill people?" they would ask me.

        "Satan gives me the strength," I would respond politely.  My bodily
 carvings gave enough evidence of that.

        Now I'm old, still in a hospital, but glad that I can't drive and
 am not forced to be a hypocrite.

        I guess that I never really thought about *WHY* it was good to be
 strong enough to kill people, but when you have a talent for something like
 that, it seems pretty remarkable.  And it feels good to do something that
 almost nobody else has the balls to do.  So fuck you.  Go back to smacking
 skunks and plowing possums, you lame ass pansy pushing mother fucker.

 THE BIG BAD by Haradrim

        Which is a more terrifying and empowering option?

        1. We die and are ended.  This would mean that our conscience
           ceases to exist, our "soul" if such a thing exists, dissipates,
           and our body rots. The being that we are is no more for all time.
           This is rather frightening, because it means we are finite, and
           the only time we have to be alive in any way or form is our time
           on Earth, which can be ended at any moment, and is often
           confusing and unhappy. The upside to this is that we don't have
           to worry much, since we are essentially dead people walking.
           We can look forward if you will, to a peaceful sleep for all
           eternity.  It all depends on whether one can stomach the idea of
           disappearing forever sometime in the next 100 years or so.

        2. There is an afterlife, in some form.  This means that death is
           merely a change of scenery, as we are either transported to
           whatever halls the dead walk, or we appear into the world again,
           via reincarnation.  The former option, suggests that after death
           we will wake up more or less, and be self-aware.  Most likely, we
           will have memories of our life, and realize more or less what has
           happened.  This would just be like living on Earth again, in my
           opinion, even if all the secrets of the universe were revealed to
           us and we were charged with a complete ecstasy for eternity,
           what would be the point?  Even ecstasy gets old after a few
           millenia, and even if we could travel to any corner of the
           universe at any point in time, we still wouldn't achieve piece
           in my mind, at best, we could have a sort of forgetful and happy
           go lucky insanity that would never fully allow us to realize our
           predicament.  The other option, reincarnation, seems slightly
           better, since we would be reborn over and over again, with very
           slight if any memories of our past lives, and could live and die
           in semi ignorance.  That would be a bit more exciting, I reckon.

        The thing about these two options is that we are living in some
 form, and that death justs shifts us, if we can manage it at all, sort of
 like Groundhog Day.

        After deliberating for the last several days, or more cloudily,
 several years, I've decided that option 1 must be the answer because 2
 makes no sense.  We have to end.  If I come back after death, that means I
 never die.  In some form, I will always exist - There isn't a reason to
 not go throw myself out the nearest window, smiling merrily to the ground.
 The fact that we actually die and never return in any way, elicits a
 certain calm in me.  I'm dead, essentially, and my destiny is inescapably
 this: I will live my life, in whatever manner I choose, and then I will
 perish, and never again know any emotion, thought, or sensation.  Either
 that, or I live forever im some manner.  Therefore, I do not fear death.
 I fear nothing.  There is no reason not to do whatever I feel like, save
 physical or emotional discomfort.  The fact that I share the streets in
 front of my home with people who are thrice my age and never wrote this
 exact same paper, reveals that for the most part, I should rely on my own
 observations mostly, all in all, its rather invigorating.

        Even the Devil needs a little revitalizing recreation now and then.
 Anton LaVey here applies his kaleidoscopic vision to conjure forth occult
 musical treasures, sending them into the ethers, to haunt and delight us.
 With his background in classical, burlesque, circus, and roadhouse styles
 of playing, LaVey uses modern synthesizer technology for illegal purposes
 --to evoke feelings. Every number LaVey plays - from Sousa march to
 child's lullaby - is carefully chosen as a potent brew of major and minor
 chords, lyricism and prosody, then supercharged to its most lusty
 interpretation. All of the instruments on this recording are played by
 LaVey on his keyboards, performed without the benefit of computer
 sequencing. SATAN HAS LITTLE USE FOR DIGITALIZED DOWNLOADS OR PIXILATED
 PROCESSING. The murky, deathless halls of Tartarus resound with songs of
 suicide, strained gaiety, and unreserved romance. Dim the lights, settle
 back, and let His Infernal Majesty take you on a holiday tour of His
 world...

        The final stage of the evaporation of a black hole would proceed
 so rapidly that it would end in a tremendous explosion (sort of like my
 sex life).  How powerful this explosion would be would depend on how many
 different species of elementary partcicles there are (about 6 people).
 If as is now widely believed, all particles are made up of perhaps six
 different varieties, the final explosion would have an energy equivalent
 to about ten million one-megaton hydrogen bombs (I think I broke myself,
 things just don't work like they used to).  As a black hole got smaller
 and hotter, it would emit a larger and larger number of different species
 of particles and produce an explosion perhaps 100,00 times more pwerful
 than the previous explanation (god damn scientists make up your minds heh
 heh black hole).  I was always very interested in how things operated and
 used to take them apart to see how they worked, but I was not so good at
 putting them back together again (should have been a doctor).

        Suppose h(x)=f(x)g(x), lim h(x) = 1/pi, and lim f(x)=3.
 evaluate g(x) d/du cos u = -sin u ---> d cos u = -sin u du

        Dionysius was not the kind of man to let himself be cowed by some
 pholosophic nob who was trying to cadge a job at his court. "You speak like
 a geriatric fool," exclaimed Dionysius in disgust.  "And you speak like a
 tyrant," replied Plato.  Plato's Academy was to flourish in Athens until
 it was finally closed by the Emperor Justinian in 529 A.D., in his attempt
 to suppress pagan Hellenistic culture in favor of Christianity (god damn
 Christians are always fucking things up).  Historians mark this date as the
 end of Greco-Roman culture and the start of the Dark Ages (stupid
 Christians, blood thirsty child raping tyrants, all of 'em!  Let's crucify
 them all!).  The frenzied and orgiastic behavior asscociated with the
 worshipers of Dionysius; the dark asspects of character and ritual that
 persisted into Greek tradgedy; the terrors and superstitions of everyday
 life-these are the shadowy side of the ealry classical era (Hail Eres)
 (All Hail Discordia) (Hail Dionysius) (All have large dunken fests where
 everybody gets naked and has wild untamed out of control sex!).

 THE SOCRATIC METHOD GAME by Linear

        A New stupid trend that I'm somewhat responsible for has been
 hitting the streets!  That old dead philosopher guy Socrates used to
 answer questions he had been asked with another question.  Or he would
 ask a question and then answer it himself.  This is the basis for what is
 known as Socratic Method.

        The Socratic Method Game started innocently enough one day when I
 asked my friend,

        "Socratic Method is cool, don't you think?"

        To which he replied: "Why would I think that?"

        Aha! See, he used Socratic Method to answer my question on his 
 opinion of Socratic Method.  Now, it could have been left at that, but I 
 answered with yet another question, throwing us further into a web of 
 Socratic Method. We continued on in this manner until one of us could no 
 longer answer with a question, thereby losing.  This happens when one
 person is too bored or stupid or both.

        After testing this out and having it get out of control, rules
 were made.  These must be followed at all times.

                - The first question of the game must have something to do
                  with Socratic method in order to let your opponent know
                  you are challenging his improvisational skills with a
                  healthy game of SMG.  If the opponent does not wish to
                  accept your challenge, he must state so immediately,
                  otherwise he must answer you with a question of his own
                  to accept your challenge.  If the opponent does not
                  clearly state he is not interested in playing, or does
                  not answer you with a question, he loses.

                  Examples:

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: You mean that stupid game?
                              GAME BEGINS.

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: I don't want to play that stupid game.
                              NO GAME.

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: That game's dumb.
                              JOE LOSES.

                - The first person who fails to reply to their opponent's
                  question with a question of his own loses.  This reply
                  can only be one sentence, and must make sense, fitting
                  in with the conversation that is going on.

                  Examples:
                            - YOU: Do you want to play Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Okay!
                              JOE LOSES.

                            - YOU: Do you want to play Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Of course I want to. Why wouldn't I?
                              JOE LOSES.

                            - YOU: Do you want to play Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Do you like hotdogs?
                              JOE LOSES.

                            - YOU:  Do you want to play Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Why not?
                              GAME CONTINUES.

                - You can not just repeat your previous question, or the
                  question that your opponent just asked you.  That would
                  avoiding the whole point of the game; being creative and
                  challenging you to think quickly.  It's like saying "I'm
                  not creative enough to answer the clever question you
                  just asked me, so I'll throw it back at you, and force
                  you to be DOUBLY clever! Wahaha, I'm sooo good!"

                  Examples:

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Do YOU like Socratic Method?
                              JOE LOSES.

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Why wouldn't I?
                              YOU:  Do you want to play?
                              JOE: Why wouldn't I?
                              JOE LOSES.

                - Your reply should be as quick as possible!  If one waits
                  forever to reply, then the point of the game is once
                  again lost.  Quick improvisational skills are a neccesity
                  here, and the point of this game is to challenge these
                  skills.  If the reply is not on the spot, then it greatly
                  reduces the challenging factor of the game.  So, quick
                  responses!

                  Example:

                            - YOU: Do you like Socratic Method?
                              JOE: Uh.....uh......uh.....Why wouldn't I??
                              JOE LOSES.

        Well, that's that.  Now you know the basics.  With some practice,
 you'll impress all your friends!  But just remember, although this game is
 quite entertaining to play, it's annoying as hell to have to listen to
 or watch others play it.  BYE!@#$%

 HOW TO PUNCH AN ANNOYING PERSON IN THE FACE by Lachyrmite

        If you are anything like me, chances are, at some point in your
 life, you've been heavily annoyed by someone and have had the urge to punch
 them in the face. However, you may have been held back by a number of
 factors. Perhaps you were afraid to due to social programming, that
 punching someone else in the face is generally a bad idea. Perhaps you
 feared possible reprimand from law enforcement agents. Or, perhaps you
 just aren't really sure how to deliver an effective punch which will make
 sure your opponent does not have the physical capability to counter attack
 you.

        If that last reason is what has been holding you back from punching
 every idiot you see, fear not! I will now instruct you, a novice in the
 ways of hand to hand combat, how to effectively punch an annoying person
 in the face, in such a way that you won't have to worry about them ever
 again... until they come after you with four friends and baseball bats.

        The first step in hitting someone with impact is to make sure they
 don't know it's coming. Don't drop into some silly martial arts looking
 stance or anything, don't even put up your fists. Just stand like you
 normally do, and don't give away any hints that you will be knocking
 several teeth out in a few moments. Try to remain calm looking, and
 somewhat disinterested.

        Next, you need to be able to make a good fist.  The most important
 thing to remember, for those of you who don't know anything at all about
 fighting, is to never punch with your thumb on the inside of your fist,
 with fingers wrapped around it. This admittedly will make your punch
 stronger... however, it will also most likely break your thumb.  One of
 the greatest things about being human is the wonderous merit of our
 opposable digits.  I suggest you don't ruin yours to break some guy's nose.

        That being said, the standard fist is made by curling your fingers
 inward to your palm, and placing the thumb resting on the middle finger
 segment, rather than resting against the curl of the pointer finger.  While
 punching with a standard fist, it is extremely important to remember to
 keep your wrist completely straight, locked out, so that your knuckles and
 the back of your hand line up evenly with the back of your forearm.

        There are alternatives to the basic fist, for those of you who are
 already comfortable with this. You can try the variant where you only bend
 the outmost two finger joints, and the joint connecting fingers to actual
 hand, the knuckle, is kept straight. In this case, you would strike with
 the middle segments of your fingers. You must keep your hand perfectly
 straight, having the back of your knuckles and your finger up to the middle
 joint in perfect alignment with the back of your hand and forearm.  This
 method has more potential damage, but I suggest you punch a few inanimate
 objects before you try hitting any people with it... the potential for
 injuring yourself with this fist is rather high. There are other
 alternatives, such as striking with the palm, or the finger tips, or
 various other parts, but for pure nose-breaking power, these two should be
 sufficient.

        The third step, and most complicated part, is following the four
 rules of generating extra force in your punches. These four rules are
 linear movement, marriage of gravity, torque, and body pivot. By following
 these four rules, you can easily double the power of your punch.

        First, you need to follow the rule of linear motion. A lot of
 times, when you see someone punch someone, they swing their fist from the
 outside inwards towards the opponent. This is a bad idea. Not only do you
 lose power with this technique, it is slower, more easily blocked, and
 makes it harder to defend yourself from incoming attacks. The best method
 is to move your fist in as much of a direct line as possible, from where
 it is now to the face of the opponent. Connect straight on, without
 wasting any time and energy with a roundhouse swing from the outside. A
 direct punch is a lot more difficult to roll with, because instead of
 simply needing to turn your face to the side to deflect a large amount of
 the impact, you need to roll your head backwards, which can send you
 flying back if you are hit hard enough, and it will also open you to
 further attacks.

        The second principle of powerful punching, is marriage of gravity.
 This is actually a very simple concept to apply. As you are punching, have
 your entire body drop slightly through a minor bending at the knees. The
 slight downward motion helps you add more force to your punch. Trust me,
 it works.

        Third, is the torque applied to the fist. When you begin your punch,
 begin with your fist "sideways," so that it is vertical rather than
 horizontal, with your thumb near the top. Then, while you are in the
 process of moving your fist through the air and towards the opponent,
 begin to rotate it so that when it connects, it connects in a horizontal
 position. It's pretty easy to do with a little practice, and the extra
 spin definitely hurts more, and the twisting has a higher chance to break
 a nose.

        The final principle you need to remember for the actual punch, is
 to pivot your entire body when you punch. Don't just jab; if you followed
 the first rule well, the other guy doesn't know it's coming. A jab will
 just disorient him for a second, and then he will know you want to fight.
 The trick is to put everything you have into that first strong hit, so
 that he won't be able to counter. To do this, shift your shoulders and,
 to a lesser degree, the trunk of your body, so that the shoulder of the
 arm you are punching with ends up pivoted out towards the opponent when
 the arm is fully extended. Try to put some of your weight behind this
 pivot, but not too much, because you want to increase the power of the
 hit but not knock yourself off balance.

        Now, at this point, you've probably done some damage. If you aimed
 for the nose, theres a good chance you broke it. You might even cause the
 collapse of a cheekbone, though that might bruise your knuckles. Stay away
 from hitting the forehead area, the skull is very thick and can hurt your
 knuckles a lot. A hit to the eye will probably blacken it. If the guy
 turned his head to try to avoid the brunt of the hit, you might hit him
 in the ear... this is good, being hit in the ear hurts a whole lot, plus
 it can cause deafness and knock the opponent off balance. If the opponent
 was being annoying and talking while you hit him, and you hit him in the
 jaw, you might even punch his mouth closed, making him bite the tip of his
 tongue off in the process. That will definitely end delusions he had of
 fighting back.

        In the case that you aren't sure he's down for good, remember;
 honorable fighters usually lose. As soon as you see he isn't a whimpering
 little ball on the floor, start hitting him some more. If you let him get
 up, you'll just have to defend yourself in a real fight, and you might
 actually get hurt... nobody wants that. So, if your hit didn't knock him
 down, punch him again. Try the stomach this time, or aim a little below
 the stomach but above the groin if he's drunk... this will make him piss
 himself. Kicking out his legs work pretty well too. I won't explain in
 detail how to kick, he's messed up enough right now that you don't really
 need to know what you're doing and you should be able to take him out.
 Once he's down, if he's trying to get up, kick him in the face or stomach
 very hard. Or stomp on him. Just don't let him take you in an even fight.

        In the case you are too soft-hearted or stupid to follow the above
 advice, just remember that 99% of fights are resolved in less than ten
 seconds. Also, the vast majority tend to follow the same routine, unless
 there are trained fighters involved; the two people immediately begin
 grappling, and use any free limbs to perform strikes. Try not to get
 sucked into this routine. A much more effective technique is to just
 strike the opponent very hard in the face whenever he tries to close in
 on you to grapple. If you do it hard enough, he will just keep being
 driven off. Capitalize on this time to begin fighting dirty if you can.
 Avoid grappling at all costs, unless you are a lot bigger than the other
 guy. Just keep hitting him in the face. This will let you win the fight.

        So just remember, next time an annoying person says something
 stupid, just follow these simple rules and punch him in the face. You'll
 be happy you did, and so will everyone around you. Violence is good like
 that.

 Scott Zibble's Masturbation Experiences Issue #001
 [Ascii art coming soon!]

 [ Disclaimer: Clearly, Scott Zibble must have lost a really awful bet to
   have this posted on the internet for everyone who has ever known him
   to see.  A very awful bet indeed.  --Editor ]

 MY FIRST TIME by Scott Zibble

        i AM sCOTT zIBBLE AND OOPS EHEHE KEYBOARD MESSUP!

        *Squirt*

        And that was my first masturbation experience.

        Wait, just kidding.

        mY FIRST. .. EHEHE DAMMIT IT HAPPENED AGAIN

        This laptop keyboard does not like me getting near the As.

        Anyway, here is the tale of my first masturbation experience.  Me,
 Scott Zibble.  My middle name surely must be something elaborately
 fantastic, like Horatio, Xavier, or perhaps Jason.  I am pretty sure my
 middle name is Jason.  This will come into play later, as you will all
 undero?

        Okay.  All my life, I suffered from a decided lack of sexuality.  My
 parents asked doctors if I needed hormone therapy to treat my lack of
 sexual development, but the doctors assured me that it was just not yet my
 time to flower and join the beautiful sexual world all around me.

        By the time I was 20, my lack of secondary sex characteristics began
 to seriously worry doctors.  Ha ha, just kidding!  I might have developed
 slowly, but not THAT slowly.  CDS NUTS?  EHEHE!  Sorry.  Just a little
 funny joke there.

        Around the time I was 15, and going to Point High School, I was
 quite thoroughly confused about my own budding sexuality.  I had played
 doctor a few times, usually with girls, and I liked what I saw.  That was
 for sure, I definitely liked naked girls somewhat.  THE THE THE THE
 JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT BREASTS BREASTS ASIAN ASIAN TONYA HARDING WEDDING
 NIGHT

        heehehe!  No, but I was 15, and all eyes were on me.  Why?  .  . .

        I was 156, shit.

        I was 15, and in love with the world.  All these new sexual
 experiences were opening up doors of opportunity in hallways of livelihood
 inside complexes of sensation in my neighborhood.  Each person I stared at
 was a doorway to a new fetish I tried on like a new pair of shoes.  The
 smoke from my cigarette wafted upwards, forming a smoky halo above the
 saloon in which we sat.  "Anything Goes," I said, striding confidently out
 the double doors, the deafening echo of the blast reawakening me to the
 real world.

        Everyone I knew talked about it.  They dreamt about it.  They even
 had hand gestures for it.  Masturbation--the cause of, and solution to all
 life's problems.  But, what was it?  I was a mere 15, as sexually
 inexperienced as a newborn babe.  Every woman that passed me brought about
 thoughts of rampant, raving, riotously rigorous romps through the sexual
 wonderlands of her nude body.  Sometimes I could barely contain myself--I
 could scarcely believe my own self-control.  My hands always stopped just
 inches from tube-tops, tank-tops, capri pants, cargo shorts, hot pants,
 wifebeaters, bomber jackets, anything that held the sweaty potential of a
 night of unrequited lust beneath it. MASTURBATION.  MASTURBATION.  The
 thought BURNED into my thoughts.  What was it?  How could I do it?  Where
 could I find it?  I had to know.

        On the eve of my 16th birthday, perhaps the most important singular
 event in my young life, I realized I could in no way consider myself a man
 without first experiencing masturbation.  I had often tried to do it
 myself, only to realize I had no idea what to do.  I rubbed up against
 doors, cars, ovens, beds, doors, washers, dryers, doors, anything I could
 rub against, all to no avail.  But I was positive that rubbing was the
 answer.  So, that night, October 29th, I realized it was now or never.

        Deep in the heart of my closet, there lay a copy of _Tit Commandos_,
 unread for quite some time.  I slowly unraveled the cardboard folder of
 sorts I had fashioned for its careful, discreet storage, and gazed at the
 magazine in all its glory.  Big Tits.  Huge Tits.  Monstrous Tits.
 Beefy Tits.  Horrific, Nightmarish Tits of Legend.  They were all there
 within my reach, ready to take me to new heights of yet unknown pleasure.

        Slowly, I opened the magazine.  The first page took me by surprise;
 it contained a picture of a completely nude, gargantuanly-breasted woman,
 causing me to immediately snap to attention.  Thinking quickly, I carefully
 unzipped my pants.  I tossed them aside without a care in the world, and
 began rubbing up against things.  My bed, my lamp, my door, my dresser, my
 toys, everything in sight.  But nothing was working.  My desperation was
 incredible.  It was already almost 11:30, with a mere half hour left before
 I had wasted my childhood.  Out of pure luck, my hand grazed against my
 manhood, and a sensation unlike that I had ever experienced before
 rocketed through my entire body.  I knew I had found my new messiah.
 Wasting no time, I clawed and pawed at my unit in every way I could, some
 things feeling good, some things feeling positively horrible, until I
 settled on a method I could live with--left thumb in urethra, left fingers
 on testicles, right hand fully encompassing penis.  I tossed, I turned, I
 struggled, I cried out to God for mercy.  11:50, and no luck.  I ripped, I
 tore, I screamed, 11:55, I floundered, I pounded, 11:58, I rotated,
 rotated, rotated, rotated, ROTATED, ROTATED, ROTATED, 11:59, ROTATED,
 ROTATED!!  ROTATED!  AHAHAH!  SUCCESS!  SUCCESS!  WE HAVE SUCCEEDED!
 11:59, ONE MINUTE BEFORE MY 16th BIRTHDAY, AND I AM A MAN!  AHAHA!

        Exhausted, I collapsed onto my bed, still clutching my twitching
 penis in my hand.  That, of course, was how my mother discovered me the
 next morning.  I have been here in jail ever since.  Write me at

 "Oops, I did it again!" by Scott Zibble

        In high school, I fancied myself an actor.  I would perform in all
 the little retarded school plays, hang out with all the retarded thespians,
 and just generally be retarded.  One night after a particularly retarded
 semi-improv, mostly badly scripted student show, I found myself at my pal
 Steven Gadlin's house.  His parents, for whatever reason, weren't home, and
 it was about 8 of us there.  I really have no recollection of what happened
 as pretense for this story, so it's a little hard to bring up a fancy
 narrative.  In any case, there was this girl there, for now we'll just call
 her J. to hide her true identity.  J. was an odd sort, and characteristic
 of odd sorts, she had an odd sense of humor.  This particular night J.
 and myself found it particularly funny to play out "performance art
 pieces" by uhh pretending to be static on televisions, or mirroring each
 other spasming, among other things.  Well, at some point while we were all
 sitting around, J. and I continued up the "performance art."  We were
 tigers, and played tiger games.  One of us would lurch at the other, and
 the other would fly backwards, then lurch out at the other, and so on,
 and so on.  This went on for a really long time, and everyone else in the
 room was disgusted by our form of flirtation, and left for Steve's bedroom.
 (We were in the front room).

        It is important to mention that sometime either around now, or
 shortly before, "The Doors" greatest hits came on.  This was the beginning
 of the end.  As "artists", see, the music certainly started to affect our
 "performance."  The scene became much more sexual, as the lurches followed
 with eye contact.  At some point, the lurching ended up in physical
 contact, and we started, uhm, rubbing each other.  Not really in a sexual
 way, but it definitely had sexual overtones.  Well, ONE THING LEAD TO
 ANOTHER (HAHAHAHA), and we were pretty much on top of each other, turning
 over and over.  I figured out a way to shove my penis as hard as I could
 into a girl's ass before I ever even kissed her!  I think I was living
 most men's dream come true!  Except, of course, most people would be
 dreaming about a girl much different than J..

        So, I had my penis between two jeaned ass cheeks, and at this point
 I had a brilliant idea.  "Hey, we're obviously dry humping.  Maybe I should
 try to kiss this girl!"  However, this was probably a bad idea, since she
 did not react to this too well.  I think it made her wake up from her
 "artist" trance, and she realised, "Oh, shit, Scott Zibble is trying to
 shove his tongue into my mouth.  FUCK, I'm a lesbian. SHIT."  At this
 point, she went to school in Saint Louis and shaved her head.  No, that was
 later.  At this point, I Think she sort of let me shove my tongue in her
 mouth.  I'm not really sure why, because I know now that she was a lot more
 attracted to my soon-to-be girlfriend than me, but maybe it was the fact
 that our bodies were completely stuck together by our sweat-ooze and she
 wouldn't be able to escape me if she tried.  That's not to say I'm a
 rapist, but I probably get the wrong idea after I dry hump a girl for 45
 minutes.

        Where was I?  Oh, ok.  At some point the doors CD ended, and we
 found ourselves completely exhausted.  So we thought to ourselves, "oh, uh,
 we're at Steve's house" and we went back into the other room and proceeded
 to drink a gallon of orange juice between us.  The tension in the room was
 pretty thick, as people did not know how to respond to the fact that they
 had walked in and saw us dry humping earlier, and we didn't react at all.
 But now we were completely drenched in sweat, and J.'s knees and feet were
 entirely black and blue.  It was cool.  Girls who are beat up by my massive
 humping attacks are cool.

        Oh well.  I don't really know where else to go with this story,
 since the end of it is completely anti-climatic.  I went on to date another
 girl for 5 years a week after this event, so I didn't have any sexual
 experiences with J. after this point.  But I will always remember fondly
 the girl who I TURNED INTO A LESBIAN by dry humping at Steve Gadlin's
 house.

 "Why Scott Zibble has a problem with Grammar"
 (Or, "What really happened...")
 by, uh, Scott Zibble

        Ok.  So I'm in this play.  But it's not really a play, it's kinda
 like this improv comedy / sketch comedy thingy... which basically changed
 my life, etc. etc. etc.  But that's my story.  This is Scott's story.  So
 here goes.

        My folks were out of town.  They were somewhere gambling.  My
 mother loves to gamble.  My father hates to gamble, but he's submissive.
 So they gamble a LOT.  They go to the boats, they go to Vegas... and it
 pisses my Dad off. But that's my Dad's story.  This is Scott's.

        So we're hanging out in the living room.  Then we move to the
 kitchen.  Then Scott and J. put on the Doors and start dancing all silly.
 We ignore them.  There is no place in the world for sexy silliness.  But
 that is the World's story.  This is Scott's.

        All of us who weren't Scott or J. head to the back room... my
 sister's old bedroom.  It had been converted into a rumpus room.  What the
 FUCK is a rumpus room?  I dunno.  But a lot of rumpus happened that night.
 Debby Paul pretended that her crotch was glued to mine, and Yael Levit sat
 in a corner and emoted.  But that's Yael's story.  This is Scott's.

        I was getting a little bored... I pried Debby Paul off of my crotch
 and walked into the kitchen to see what was up.  Scott's PENIS was.  HA!
 Him and J. had escalated their performance art into DRY HUMPING.  (I
 really didn't know this was dry humping... I didn't hear the phrase dry
 humping until weeks later when J. told me HER side of the story.  At the
 time, I just called it 'making out.'")  But that's a parenthetical story.
 This is Scott's.

        "Wooo!" I said.  Ribald ribald ribald.  Ribald McDibald.  Over 6
 Billion served.  Master and Servant.  But that's Depeche Mode's story.
 This is Scott's.

        I snuck back to my sister's old bedroom, and said in my loudest
 whisper... "HOLY FUCKING SHIT, SCOTT AND J. ARE FUCKING MAKING OUT!!"
 Then, one by one, we snuck down the hallway to peek in the kitchen.  This
 went on.. and on... and on....  (Dude... this is f'n crazy.  If I was dry
 humping J. my senior year of High School, I would have lasted about 30
 seconds.  DAMN!  Scott had endurance man!  He dry humped the FUCK out of
 this girl.  If dry humping was an institution like sex is, Scott would be
 the fucking Rico fucking Suave of DRY HUMPING!!!!!!!!)  But that's dry
 humping's story.  This is Scott's.

        Rrrrrrrrrrico!  Suuuuuuuuaaaaaave.  That was for Katie.  But that's
 Katie's story.  This is Scott's.

        About an hour later, Scott finished up.  To this day, I don't know
 if "finishing up" meant he shot a wad of spunk in his jeans, or he just
 got tired of the rug burns.  Same dif.  So they come back into the room.
 Let me lapse into a story here:

        There is a face people make when they are hiding something.  It is a
 labored face.  They are trying their DAMNDEST to keep their face from
 letting on that they KNOW something.  That they've SEEN something.  This
 face is not a fun face for anyone involved.  Every single muscle of the
 face is CONTROLLED.  Every brain cell is spent on making these muscles
 LIE.  Making these muscles pretend that they have not just seen Scott
 Zibble dry humping J. on their fucking KITCHEN FLOOOOOOOOR!!!  HOLY
 FUCKING SHIT, SCOTT!  THESE MUSCLES STILL HURT FROM THE MOMENT YOU WALKED
 INTO THAT BEDROOM WITH J.  AND A GALLON OF FUCKING ORANGE JUICE.  We saw
 you, Scott.  We all fucking saw you.  We saw you, J.  Well.  We saw the
 pieces of you that were sticking out from under Scott's DRY HUMPING BODY.
 Arms.  Wiggling around.  Legs kinda kicking... kinda saying, "Holy shit,
 this goth-dude is ramming his manhood into my... my thighs.  Doesn't he
 know where the fucking vagina is?!@#@!?"

        This story can only end with a rhyming couplet.

        When the Doors said, "Come on baby light my fire,"
        They didn't mean dry humping J.
        Bitch.

 ":)"
 by Scott Zibble

        :)

 [1]: I never had an orgasm.  In fact, I don't know if I'm able to have
      an orgasm outside of unprotected vaginal sex.  But that's another
      story.  This is my dry humping story.

 [2]: I always knew that you had seen it, since I heard you whisper at
      some point.  I bet J. had heard it, too, because that made the part
      where we sit there and drank all your orange juice a lot more funny.

 [3]: It could have been worse.  It could have been Tamara Newberger.
      This is a reference only one person will find funny.

 "Soybean's First Masturbation Experience" by Scott Zibble

        Actually, this is not about Katie's first masturbation experience.
 This is about the first time Katie caught Drew Hunt masturbating.

        I don't know any details about this story at all.  But that
 introduction sure is funny!

 "The Rally" by Scott Zibble, clearly

        Well, I know there's a bunch of rumors going around out about my
 "first time," (hehehe) but I thought I'd finally set the record straight.
 It'll help me clear the air.

        I know a lot of people's "first time"s are usually awkward, private
 moments which they often do not like to share with others, but really, why
 all the fuss?  We should be more open about our private lives and personal
 details! It's all in good fun!

        Anyway, when I was 17, I went to my first rally.  We were
 protesting capitalism.  Or, a capitalist society, more specifically.  It
 was in front of Wall Street and there were 211 other people, including the
 most interesting creature  I've ever met, Ayn Rand.

        Now, I know some people say this ol'  bird ain't no looker, but
 there's so much you can really talk about.  The way she uses words and
 laughs with her friends!  The way she smiles... the way her lips curve....
 oh, I could go on forever about it.  But rather than overload you with all
 these gushing details, I'll just tell you this:  I was completely captured.
 Beyond her looks, her personality was so defined.  So objective.  And her
 wild beauty was merely the signature on the check that was my love.

        But I couldn't talk to her!  I was so embarassed... she was such a
 better protester, always sayin' just the right chant at the right time.
 All night I stared at her--I stared into her beautiful eyes, but she didn't
 even notice me.  She pretended like I didn't exist.  Eventually, when she
 was alone for a few minutes, I approached her:  "hey," I said, "I'm a
 Zibble. Private property sucks!"  I was trying to be funny.  Did it work?
 She said "hey," back.

        I'll spare you the details, but when I got home after our long talk
 that night, I felt something I never had felt before.  My body had a
 certain tingle.  I kept imagining her smiling, telling me about her silly
 theories, over and over and over again, and she had so much to say!  She
 brought so much of herself out, that it awoken something inside of me.

        Now, my parent raised me right.  I was a decent, American kid.  I
 had my morals.  I didn't think about dirty things like that... but this
 time, I couldn't contain myself--literally!  Before I knew it, after
 thinking about her for so long, I made a little surprise mess in my pants.
 That was weird!

 "My Last Time" by Scott Zibble

        I scarcely have time to even scrawl this down on paper, this, the
 last will and testament of Scott Zibble.  The ruined shopping mall is still
 raining down slowly upon me, even as I frantically stuff my last remaining
 cartridge into my modified AK-47.  I take slow, determined breaths,
 careful not to give any excessive notification of my presence.  Even in
 this hellish, wasted landscape in which I now sit, thoughts of happier
 times float through my visage.  I see J., I see _Tit Commandos_, I see
 every joyous sexual moment of my entire life.  And I see my own end
 approaching.  How is this possible?  How is it I have been so defeated?
 Head so full of wonder, visions of the past, with this decadent reality
 slowly swallowing my every action.  Oh, god, let it all be over soon.

        Was it really yesterday?  Was it so long ago, so far away, yet so
 crystal clear?  Sitting quietly, undiscovered, stashed away behind piles
 and piles of canned food, I partook in the final sexual experience of my
 all too brief life.  A quite rotted banana in the corner of the shelter
 had a faded Chiquita sticker on its pungent shell, with the lewdly winking
 image of the whorish Carmen Miranda.  She wanted me.  There was no doubt.
 She wanted her final rot-free fling to be with a real man like Scott Jason
 Zibble.  I quietly undid my pants, allowed everything to fall into place,
 and quickly and silently performed the joyous deed.  There was no real joy,
 merely the blissful first relaxation I had experienced since this whole
 horrible mess got started.

        I know they are close now.  I do not have much time left.  If this
 is the last thing I ever write, so be it.  I will make my stand.  Now.

 "Top 10 Masturbation Singles" by Scott Zibble

        I have found it is not always easy to find good music to furiously
 masturbate to.  So, I have kept a good log of great music to masturate to.
 Here is my top 10.

 10.  "I wanna sex you up" by Color Me Badd -- Although this song is
      typically frowned upon by current youth, The message is clear:
      unshaven rough boys singing about sex is always great masturbation
      music.

 9.   "Hey Jude" by The Beatles -- This may not seen like a very sexual
      song, but the crescendo at the end when they go "na na na na
      nanananana" is the perfect climax to the song.  GET IT? CLIMAX? WHEN
      YOU HAVE AN ORGASM SOMETIMES YOU CALL IT A CLIMAX?

 8.   "2 B The Master" by the Pokemon People -- What can I say?  Whenever
      I think of the ice queen Jesse, my turgid cock jumps to attention.

      This isn't funny at all, so I will just jump to #1.

 1.   "Freedom '90" by George Michaels -- I'm gay.

 TAKING A PUNCH TO THE FACE WHEN BEING ANNOYING by Lachrymite

        At some point in your life, you've been an annoying little bitch.
 It's true for all of us.  Someone, somewhere, sometime, has wanted to hit
 you as hard as they can with their fist, right in your nose, in order to
 cause blood to squirt and bone to break.  Don't get upset by it, it's
 just a part of being human.  Luckily for you, not many people have read,
 "How to Punch an Annoying Person in the Face."  Thus, you most likely
 haven't been punched in the face while being annoying, and that's usually
 a good thing because you probably aren't that good looking to begin with,
 a broken nose could very well make you downright hideous.

        Fear not, though!  I will once again be your tutor in the ways of
 hand to hand combat, and will give you simple instructions on how not to
 get your nose broken when being annoying.

        First off, the best way to avoid this is by simply not being
 annoying. For most people, unfortunately, this step simply isn't feasible.
 Since you can't control your urges to be annoying, I suppose we must move
 on to the next step, even though prevention really is the best defense.

        If you actually do find yourself being annoying, remember to always
 be paranoid.  No matter who you are with, whether they are a little old
 lady or a seven foot tall escaped convict named Bubba, the person may just
 decide to hit you in the face for some stupid comment you made.  Never
 trust anyone, and be on guard at all times.  Also, watch everyone's
 shoulders.  This may seem odd to you at first, but the earliest sign that
 you are about to get punched is that the shoulders will begin to shift.
 Don't listen to those people who say, "Always watch the eyes of your
 enemy!"  They are stupid. Anyone who has a good amount of training won't
 give away in their eyes when they are about to smash your face in.

        So now you see the shoulders of your enemy starting to shift, and
 his arm is beginning to rise, like he's going to punch you in the face.
 Now, the best way to take a punch is to get out the way.  There are several
 ways to do this, depending on the type of punch being thrown.

        First, if the person hasn't read, "How to Punch an Annoying Person,"
 they probably have no idea what they are doing, and are swinging wildly.
 If the person is literally swinging at you, with his fist going from the
 outside in a circular motion inwards towards your body, the best way to
 avoid it is to step into his punch.  Get in close enough that his fist goes
 somewhere behind you, and his forearm or elbow joint hits your arm.  This
 will do absolutely no damage to you, and you are in a great position to
 counter the punch.  From this close up position, you can punch him
 yourself, you can knee him in the testicles, you can even pull a Three
 Stooges move and poke him in the eyes if you just want to be even more
 annoying.  You can also parry his attack by grabbing his arm and doing
 various nasty twisty things to it, but we won't get into that.  If you want
 to be really mean, you should be close to smooch him on the lips.

        If the punch gets through, you must immediately turn your head with
 the force of the punch, so that if the blow hits on the right side of your
 head, turn your face to the left, to help deflect some of the impact.  It
 will also help lessen damage to your neck if you roll with the punch.
 Whatever you do, don't tense up your neck before you are hit, that is much
 more likely to cause all sorts of icky spinal damage.  You wouldn't want to
 end up like Christopher Reeves, would you?

        Also, try not to actually move your head until the fist is
 connecting.  Moving your head too early will result in you getting punched
 in the ear, which is a very uncomfortable experience.

        If the person has indeed read, "How to Punch an Annoying Person,"
 they are probably going to be coming at you in a much more direct manner.
 There are two ways to deal with this.  Your decision should be based on how
 strong your opponent seems to be, and how thick you believe your skull to
 be.  For example, our friend Quarex should most definitely stick to method
 two, while those of us with significantly less armored craniums should
 stick to method one.

        First, if you think your skull isn't very thick, your opponent looks
 very strong, and you can probably move faster than him, you should get the
 hell out of the way.  The most effective way to do this is to simply shift
 your body, in a short dodge.  If your opponent is striking with his right
 hand, step back with your left foot, placing it behind your right foot, and
 pivot your body so you are now no longer facing him.  With practice, you
 can become amazingly fast at this, it's quite impressive.  When the attack
 comes from the opposite arm, repeat with reverse foot.  This technique also
 works well against weapons, so if he pulls a knife and tries to stab you,
 this is probably your safest bet.  Once his fist is where your face was a
 few moments earlier, you should grab it and use it to your advantage in
 countering.  

        One especially gruesome thing to do is to place your leg underneath
 the armpit of the enemy's extended arm, and while holding the arm, jump
 up with your grounded leg and use the leg that is on the enemy to shove.
 Yank the arm as hard as you can while you do this.  You will end up on the
 ground, but if you have any luck or weight, the enemy will have something
 popped out of a socket, most likely a wrist if you grabbed the hand. This
 is guaranteed to end a fight.  If it doesn't just get up, and start hitting
 whatever part of his body has been ripped from the socket.  He will most
 likely start crying.  Optionally, you can use this grabbed arm to pull him
 into one of your own punches with more force.

        If you have a lot of room on either side, you may wish to simply
 sidestep the attack by shifting your entire body towards the opponent and
 to the right or left, by means of shuffling the feet in a quick one step
 move with each foot.  This is actually safer, but it is more effective for
 running away, as you are now somewhat behind your opponent.

        If you are like our mighty friend Quarex, and your skull has natural
 armor, you may instead opt to take the punch.  Yes, that's right, actually
 get hit.  Although this sounds silly at first, the trick is getting to
 choose where your enemy hits you; your skull.  Lower your head slightly,
 so that his fist collides with the area just above your forehead.  This is
 pretty much the thickest and strongest bone in your body.  Hopefully, the
 knuckles of the person punching will slam into your forehead.  You will get
 a bruise most likely, but if he has a lot of force, he will break his
 knuckles.  If he keeps throwing punches, you can keep blocking like this.
 If at any time you feel like you are going to pass out, then you should
 stop trying to break his knuckles with your head, and start dodging
 instead.

        Honestly though, it's stupid not to dodge after the first punch,
 and you probably deserve to have your brain knocked around a bit.  You
 can't actually build up an offensive while just bashing your skull into
 the knuckles of the enemy, so I suggest this as a technique to mainly
 unsettle the opponent.  After all, most people won't want to keep fighting
 a guy who happily mashes his head into your fist.  You can use this
 intimidation advantage to help you beat him, but make sure you aren't a
 retard and just keep getting hit, unless you have Fight Club delusions or
 something equally dumb.

        Also note, that if the person uses an alternative to the standard
 fist, this will be far less effective.  You probably won't break anything,
 you'll be lucky to give them a bruise.  In this case, you should still use
 the forehead block technique if you absolutely have to, but it's far more
 intelligent to just dodge.

        If you follow all of these strategies, you will be able to
 effectively defend yourself from anyone who may have the sudden urge to
 punch you in the face.  This is an invaluable skill, because you are
 probably an annoying piece of shit, and people most likely often want to
 punch you.

 THINGS I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR IN JUNIOR HIGH by Haradrim

        1. Punching an australian kid in the head.

        This was on a wednesday if I remember correctly. The night before
 I had gotten a rather sub-standard haircut, an offset bowl cut that made
 me look a cross between the beatles and spock, since my hair was died
 jet black. I was already rather sensitive about this, (having gotten a
 comment from everyone I saw that I knew) and while engaging a kid who had
 just moved to our little shit hole from Australia in conversation during
 first period art class, he made the comment, in a thick aussie accent that
 "It looks lawk ya got ya hair cut wif a lawnmower!". Now, this kid had,
 admittedly, already seen some rough times, for being such an Aussie
 immigrant to Iowa and whatnot, but he had also made friends with some of
 my enemies, and had made the remark about my hair. Not that I stopped to
 consider these factors. About two seconds after he said it, my fist
 zoomed with maximum force into the side of his face, knocking him over a
 chair. The next few seconds were a wolverine-like berseker rage,
 everything blurred and time slowed to a crawl, as I searched my scopes for
 my opponent. Then the rather massive art teacher screamed, put me in a
 bear hug and carried me out of the room. After a brief visit to the
 principles office and some various witness reports we were both suspended
 for 3 days. This caused me to be home earlier than expected and
 consequently, to begin my newspaper delivering earlier than normal, at
 about 11AM instead of 3pm. This deviation from normal schedule caused me
 to run into a group of people who normally wouldn't have crossed my path,
 who ended up chasing me around with a gun for about 20 minutes. All in all
 a bad day.

        2. Wearing a bullet proof vest.

        The day after the Jonesboro shooting, I wore a bulletproof vest to
 school. "Twisted bid for attention" and "brilliant socio-political
 commentary" topped the lists of theories people gave for my doing this
 (I did it mainly because it occured to me that I could).  My art teacher
 decided it was the same as walking into school with a gun, and sent me to
 the office, where he presumed I would be expelled.  The principle, and the
 assistant principle, and the other office staff, after staring at me and
 whispering from the doorway of the principle's office for about five
 minutes, kindly asked me to put it in my locker and return to class.

        3. The latex breastplate.

        I like halloween. I overindulge myself on halloween most years.
 One of my more interesting costume relics was a latex plate that strapped
 to my chest and made it appear that my innards were falling out, and a
 goblin was in my stomach, chewing on them. Because the idea popped into
 my head, i wore it under my shirt to school and randomly showed it to
 people throughout the day, mainly out of the blue while they were talking
 to me. I got all the way to 2nd period before i got sent up to the office
 and it got confiscated.  My parents did not get it out of confiscation for
 me.

        4. Gang related activities.

        The assignment was to illustrate the 2nd amendment......my
 brilliant drawing included 4 handguns on fire arranged to make a swastika,
 a design i stole from Juxtapoz art magazine (Hitler was for gun control...
 America has freedom to bear) among revolutionary war soldiers, and floating
 molotov cocktails.  They couldn't tell me what gang this indicated I
 belonged to exactly, but I got suspended for 3 days.  My parents thought
 this was stupid and appealed it with the local school board.  The
 suspension was overturned, we won.

        5. Deliverance

        The assignment had something to do with "mountain men" and
 illustrating them.  The mention of "mountain men" in my mind brings forth
 the two inbreds from the classic movie Deliverance, who end up raping the
 canoers in one of the best scenes in movie history ("Squeal like a
 piggy!")......so i incorporated this fairly overtly into my poster, and
 got another trip to the office.

        6. Being Nuts.

        My 8th grade english teacher was an old and crotchety woman who
 didn't particularly like me.  It was mutual.  Apparently, some of the
 drawings in my notebook (which she photocopied when I was out of the room)
 some of my shirts, some of my facial expressions, etc, disturbed her, and
 she recommended me for psychological counseling.  My parents and I were
 not notified or asked, but I was summoned to the office and a rather
 skeptical young black man interrogated me for an hour or so, wanting to
 know if I was satanic, if my parents beat me up, if I ate small children,
 if I burned crosses, and if I listened to _Nine Inch Nails_.  He had me go
 back to class after getting nothing but "no", "yes", and an unchanging
 scowl from me.  I still had no idea what the hell was going on til my
 parents called the school that night and got me taken out of the psych
 program.

        7. Coming to class.

        I talked.  I got sent out of the room.  After waiting about half
 an hour for the teacher to come yell at me, I simply re-entered the room
 and sat at my desk.  30 seconds later, I was on my way to the office.

        8. Wearing naughty things.

        I have probably over 100 t-shirts, most of them black, and sporting
 some kind of offensive slogan or picture.  I wore many of these to school,
 where I ended up having to wear them inside out.  The all-time favorite 
 was from the Church of Euthanasia, who used to reside over at paranoia.com,
 which read "Save The Planet - Kill Yourself" on the front and
 "Suicide * Abortion * Cannibalism * Sodomy" on the back.

        9. Talking.

        I talk.  Loudly and at times I shoudln't. This causes many
 detentions.

        10. Throwing things.

        I throw things. Heavy things at times I shouldnt.  This causes many
 trips to the office.

        11. Screaming

        Often times, our cafeteria was forced to be completely silent,
 because being kids at lunch, we talked a lot.  The noise got to our
 overseers.  So, in a completely silent room filled with a couple hundred
 kids I HAD to do something.  The first something was to fall over
 backwards grabbing my foot and screaming. foot cramp I said. They didnt
 buy it.  A couple weeks later, I just screamed "fuck me in the ass" at
 the top of my lungs, then completely denied it.  They didnt really buy
 that either, but they didnt know what to do about it.

        12. Miscellaneous.

        There was a bunch of other crap, but I cant recall at the moment.
 I think I got in trouble for mummifying myself with tape, too.

        Epilogue: I have gotten into 0 trouble in 2 years of high school.
 I attribute this to a different school district where the teachers aren't
 all cruel and poor.

 THE WIZARD by pl0nk

        see this hand,
        it makes $100,000 a day
        and this hand,
        this hand makes another $100,000 a day,
        king of this game'n shit since NES came out 
        motha fuckaz know when they come bring the ruccus to the motha fuckn
        wizard, ain't gonna be nuttin but straight up torcher an shit, bitch.

        yo yo yo 

        i'll fuckin tie you to a bed post with your ass cheeks all spread
        out an shit put a hanga on a stove and let that shit sit on the
        stove for like a half an hour and than stick it up your ass all
        slow like

        yo i'll fuckn i'll fuckin lay ya nuts up on a dresser, just ya nuts
        layin on the dresser and bang them shits with a spiked bat, whasa
        ( BLAOW )

        yo i'll fuckn i'll fuckn pull your tongue out ya fuckn mouth and
        stick a rusty ass screw driver 

        -----

        thus we ended the power trip of THE WIZARD and began the disassembly
 of his brain. three hours later we had the wizards brian and the vast
 knowledge which was contained inside. we had the codes and the plans, we
 had the fingering techniques and the game genie. who was this game genie,
 an alternate personality? perhaps it was the key to the wizards success.
 none the less we were going to be rich and famous.

        the plastic sugery was a success, granted i pay a load of money for
 this operation.  i don't think to many people realise how much it costs to
 get a total make over to look like the wizard, aside from those who only
 dreampt it up in hollywood.

        i took the money and fled to amsterdam, where else would you go if
 you were rich?  everythings legal, underaged prostitution, drugs, beatings,
 killings, burned cds, mp3s you name it and it'll probably be legal.

        a year after aquiring the brain we had fully analyzed the game genie
 and were able to encrypt it into a program and designed an attachment to
 games. this is what everyone was after, the key to winning all games. We
 called it, " Game Genie. " and sold it in stores for 80$ a pop, gave 1
 booklet with 100 game titles and than sold seperate books for 25$ to make
 back pay so that we were able to afford all the cars, the boats, the
 houses and the hookers.

        three years later, nintendo died. super nintendo arose. there has
 never been a new wizard to date and if there is, they will never show
 their face because the wizard found out!

 FRANKIE AND SPARKS by Puck

 Frankie and Sparks, it turns out, were both waiting for the same moment
 their entire lives.  This coincidence only became apparent after it
 happened - after reality slipped up and exposed its seams.  After all
 that was real and true unbecame.  After one very existential,
 soul-twisting hiccup.

	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Frankie.
	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Sparks.  

 And then, together, "I knew it."

 Ever since Frankie could remember, he had felt there was something wrong
 with the world.  He knew that one day, reality would come undone, and
 everything would finally make sense.  It was all somebody else's game.
 He was just a piece.  As he grew older, this feeling built up inside of
 him like a pressure.  Love, hate, loneliness, the Ethiopians, none of
 these things were real.  They would be exposed as mere punch lines to some
 grand joke.  And all would be right as he let out his sigh.

	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Frankie.
	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Sparks.  

 And then, together, "I knew it."

 When Sparks was in college, there was one drug-induced false alarm.  She
 had been coaxed into dropping acid by her roommate.  As zebras began
 climbing out of their dorm room walls, Sparks lapsed into frenzied
 laughter.

	"I knew it," she said.  "None of this was real.  There are zebras
 leaping out of the walls.  Reality was wrong."  Later, she wore her
 disappointment like a thick overcoat that had been left out in the rain,
 and snarled.

	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Frankie.
	"Ohhhhhhhhhhh," said Sparks.  

 And then, together, "I knew it."

 And this time, they did.  There was no mistake.  Frankie and Sparks both
 bore witness to reality's undoing.  Frankie sighed.  He felt an enormous
 rush of relief.  Weights were lifted off of his shoulders that he never
 even knew were there.  There was no laughing this time for Sparks.  A tear
 welled up in each eye and hung weightless on her cheeks.  This was all
 expected.  These were all feelings they had been waiting for.  All except
 one.

 Sparks turned to Frankie, put her lips on his, and all the while purple
 hand grenades, thousands of millions of purple hand grenades, reflected
 in the teardrops on her cheeks.

 why did i ever trust you, peanut butter?
 did you not like what was in the future for you?
 questions have answers that may indeed be found within the imaginary
 number "i".

 "i" = square root of one.

 there are lots and tons of things that have "i " in it.  things such as
 paintings, especially those of a cubist nature, and other such things
 as peanut butter. but why "i" never trusted that you would pull through
 is because you have no faith in the power of "you". always blaming the
 tragic circumstances, always lamenting your plight. oh just FUCK OFF
 will "you". and now you return to me, oh-god-dammned peanut butter and
 claim that you are only made of peanuts and butter churned in aunt
 charlemagne's barn. that cow set chicago on fire for a reason, you
 know. free will and killer whales have never been a better combination.

 so now that you have realized the power of "i", please retract all your
 statements and even your questions for a better imaginary world which
 can never be proven as calculus or honey. the combination on a sandwich
 is a permutation which can only make sense to those who know the
 language. those who are literate can feed the hungry. those who are
 poor can feed the rich. talentless, or otherwise said the bible -- the
 stinger bee attitudes.

 you have tasted other honeys, you have sinned. you have nibbled on

 only calculus that i can express myself to you. confused calculations,

 remains blue kraut, wedding dresses remain wedding dresses, as the
 tongue-tied germans might say.

 "i" has fallen from the grace. "i" has loved too many. "i" has now
 learned to never base responsibility on that which is real.

 "i" loved "you".

 IN REGARDS TO QUAREX'S PENIS by Soybean

	I first spoke with the viking known as Quarex on the evening of
 December 13, 1997, as well as the illustrious bunch of his friends from
 Bloomington/Normal.  While there was a sizable group I spoke with that
 night, Quarex stood out, as he was much more forthcoming with information
 about himself, coupled with everyone else being completely shameless in
 reporting details about him before themselves.  Among other things I
 learned that night, I discovered that Quarex was unable, in spite of his
 most valiant efforts, to get girls; I discovered that he was the renowned
 leader of Aethelwulf's Utopia BBS; and that he had a giant head.  What
 stood out above all, however (aside from the giant head), was his repeated
 insistence that he was a man who had evolved beyond the need for
 masturbation -- that it was an activity he never engaged in.

	A number of months later, PezMonkey and I ended up in Litchfield,
 IL, at her uncle's house, with Quarex, Jamesy, MadPony, and RJ (I have
 lost track of his handle).  An odd weekend overall, most notable was that
 I ended up dating Quarex shortly after, due in large part to a bet he had
 made with his friends years earlier.  This New Relationship with Quarex
 enabled me to learn more about him and observe habits which were
 previously unknown to me.  As such I was unable to unravel parts of the
 enigma that is Quarex [aka BunnyMustard].  Since then, he has himself
 admitted to being a liar, though no directly, in HOE #1101, "The First
 Time," a file detailing his first masturbation experience.  (I add that
 this file was also written due to a bet made with Mogel some time ago).

	In my time with Quarex, I uncovered a great deal of evidence
 indicating that he was lying in his incessant insistant that he was above
 masturbating.  This evidence is detailed below.

        1.  He is male.  I suspected this previous to dating him,
            incidentally.

        2.  He takes hour long showers daily.  Take from this what you will.

        3.  Umm.  I believe I witnessed said activity at his house in
            May of 1998.

        4.  A person who so vehemently denies doing such a thing is
            obviously very much a practicer of said activity.

	I think that actually covers it fairly succinctly.  While I have
 suspected Drew was a fervent masturbator for the last 2.5 years, his
 admission of it at this time confirms the hesitance I felt toward our
 continuing friendship.  Quarex, you have destroyed our trust, and in turn,
 our friendship.  I bid you farewell, Masturbator.

 WORTHLESS EX-GIRLFRIEND by Quarex

        My ex-girlfriend Jennifer is the kind of person you more or less
 want to forget about after dating.  You will remember the lessons you
 learned from dating the person (in other words, "Do not date girls who
 talk about shopping constantly, or refer to themselves as fat though also
 admit they are anorexic"), but you try to forget everything else.

        Well, I knew I wanted to make some kind of text file about her,
 since that is what I do with most everything in my life.  I also knew it
 had to be something disturbing and/or funny.  I threw away the notes she
 gave me, so I cannot use those for fodder (I assure you she misspelled
 "You're" as "Your" every chance she got), and I deleted most of her
 e-mail, but one untapped resource is still available to me: ICQ Messages.

        Unfortunately, the new version of ICQ I have has somehow removed
 the most useful feature, which is exporting the message history to a
 text file.  So, in lieu of that, I just figured searching my messages to
 and from her for the word "cum" would prove most entertaining.

        Thus, here is a very brief chronological history between my
 month-and-a-half girlfriend, Jennifer, and me.  And no, I am not adding
 random spaces and pauses in her text, that is actually how she types, as
 bizarre as it may be.  And I also apologize in advance for anyone feeling
 physically ill when they think about me doing something sexual with a girl,
 but if it is any consolation, you will find essentially we did none of the
 things she went on and on about, even if primarily because I did not really
 want to touch a SKELETON in that "special way."

 JUNE 23: ABOUT A WEEK AFTER WE START DATING

 J: "god, I am cumming everywhere just thinking about you"

 Q, in retrospect, sez: Now, I already knew this was not the
    kind of thing you generally say to your boyfriend
    after you had been dating for a week.  Especially
    when the most sexual thing you had done is (not very
    much) kissing.

 JUNE 30: A WEEK AND A HALF AFTER WE START DATING

 J: "Well I feel that way (referring to the note she left me)
    and honestly I think that the more time we spend together
    the more i think about us having sex"

    (a little later)

 J: "you want to suck me don't you
     your making me so horney
     that i just want to get on top of you and ride you
     and ride you and rub your dick and making you squirt all over me
     you getting me all wet
     so wet i stick my finger in me and i am cumming everhwhere"

 Q, in retrospect, sez: Keep in mind, by this point, and indeed
    throughout the course of our relationship, nothing detailed
    in these two messages even happened.  She did not "ride me"
    and "rub my dick" and "make me squirt all over her," and I
    certainly did not "suck her," whatever the hell she exactly
    meant by that.

    (about 20 hours later, but the same day)

 J: "This is some cyber
    for your viewing pleasure tonight.
    I slowly
    get on top of you
    slowly slide your dick up inside of me
    thrusting back and forth
    making you groan and moan and your grabbing my nipples and
    making them harder and i
    go back and forth"

 Q, in retrospect, sez: Christ, of all the things she sent me
    that made me say "Oh god, she really is nuts," this is one
    of the biggest ones.  Well, that, and the one where she
    said "Promise me you wouldn't believe it if Jeremy (the guy
    I was pretty sure she would cheat on me with the whole time
    we dated, who she dated once we broke up) made up some fake
    chat logs with my name on them where I said how much I cared
    about him and missed him."

        Okay, Jennifer, gee whiz, I would not get mad about those OBVIOUSLY
 FORGED chat logs.  Why, that would be silly.

        Unfortunately, "cum" does not appear again until July 18th.

 J: "i want your cum
    and i want you
    and i want your dick
    and damn it
    damn i want you"

 Q, in retrospect, sez: I was already in full-scale "How the
    hell do I break up with her?" mode by this point, so this
    message was just more or less funny.

        Then, a while later, I broke up with her, citing that it was for
 the best that we broke up before I moved to Urbana and we had to deal with
 the "pain" of a long distance relationship. Ha ha ha.  That is the only
 time I have felt good about, or even really gone through with, lying to
 a girl.

        Then, here is the last message I sent her before making this text
 file, putting her on ignore, and deleting her from my "contact list:"

        Oh no.  My goodness.  I certainly will.  Oh goodness, I am sorry
 to have ever harassed you.  Remind me again, who was the one who called
 the other one 10 times a day while we were dating?  Who was the one doing
 the harassing?  Oh yeah, you.  And your boyfriend's webpage
 (www.geocities.com/bleak_omen) tells anyone with a brain all they need to
 know about him: scum.

        Love with humans is the problem, muh boys. Humans are impossible to
 deal with. They are tempermental and generally bitchy, especially the
 female variety. Not to mention that you actually have to talk to them in
 many circumstances, even the ones who can barely utter coherent syllables.
 Well, 'Bah on Humans, ' I say. Actually, I would rather say,
 "Baaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa." You see, Young Confused Ones, you must find an
 attractive animal of any sort. As long as it turns you on, my brothers,
 I say that you should find the 'proper' type of beastie that will fulfil
 every wanton craving you have ever had. And get this: as long as you barely
 keep these new best friends alive, you have a partner whom you may shower
 your affections in bizarre and EXCITINGLY NEW FOR '95! way that will
 having you thanking God Above for all the critters in the fields.

        Here's a submission.  Ne'er done this before and therefore it
 WILL suck.  But I s'pose that's the point.

 "I Have Standards" by JaneX

 I Have Standards.  I am a Non-Conformist.  I am too Cool for Pop-Culture.
 I wake up every morning in some Unmentionably-Big-City-on-the-East-Coast-
 -of-America-which-is-Conspicuously-Covered-more-and-more-With-Advertising-
 -but-shall-not-herein-be-Named and throw off my _Land's End_ Blanket only
 to put together yet another one of my STYLISHLY SNAZZY _Old Navy_
 Ensembles (19.95$ this week for a pair of their Special Boot Cut Chino
 Ultra Deluxe Pant) and throw on my _Nike_ sneakers.  As I lace them up, I
 like to nibble on my _Post_ Raisin Bran, which is heartily flavored with
 _Silk_ brand SoyMilk (Plain, not Vanilla or Chocolate).  I use my _Gap_
 messenger bag to help push myself past the throng of people standing
 outside Hip Spots that I choose not to frequent because, well, you won't
 believe this, but...   I HAVE STANDARDS.

        In the middle of the day, I might decide to go downstairs to the
 _McDonald's_ next door and get a McVeggie Burger (You see this is what we
 Non-Conformists call Activism).  And later, I might decide I want to be
 extra-posh and slip out of my _Nike's_ and into a nice pair of _Doc
 Marten's_ which go better with my dogged vegetarianism anyhow.  On my way
 to a couple classes, I might read a copy of _Cosmopolitan_ or
 _Mademoiselle_ and wonder to myself why anyone pays 3.95$ for an issue of
 each when my subscription averages each copy out to only 3.74$!  After
 class, I might finally decide to take a shower in which I might scrub my
 scalp with _Herbal Essences_ because I Believe in the Importance of using
 products which are 99% natural.  Why?  BECAUSE I HAVE STANDARDS!!!

        I live in a big city.  I have no fashion sense!  NO FASHION SENSE!
 I wear clothes made in sweatshops, wear doc marten's though I'm a
 vegetarian, and pretty much everything I consume in some way or another
 has a price-tag and a name brand sewn onto it (including my last
 boyfriend), yet I command you to understand that I DO HAVE STANDARDS!!!!

        I have standards because everyday I am forced to pass at least one
 of the six _Starbucks_ within the one block radius of my home and everyday
 I am forced to shudder at least once thinking of the poor witless souls who
 shamelessly believe that sipping an overpriced Latte that is about as
 homebrewed as a BigMac is straight from the cow makes them a part of some
 sort of Hip Underbelly of the Big City that sits around reading French
 poetry and kissing their friends once on each cheek.

        So what's the moral of the story?  Nothing really. Except I HAVE
 STANDARDS!!  And you probably don't because you're probably sitting there
 drinking a MOCHACCINO RIGHT NOW!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH!!!!!!

        I am The Only Non-Conformist with Standards Left In the WHOLE
 WIDE WORLD!!!!

        MUAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHH!!!!!

 PENS by aster

        I have three colors of pens, yellow, red, and blue but not in that
 order at all.  they say words on them but i cant read.  i think my favorite
 one is the red one, even though when you write with it it is rather light
 and not bright.  but the yellow is too bright and blinding and the blue is
 too light-turquoise.

        i also have a black one, and brown, and dark/bright orange and
 light orange and light greena nd dark green and light blue and purple and
 purple pink magenta.

        they have hexagonal tops.

        but the rest is round.

 HOME by Effy

        The first thing I remembered was the chaotic organization, as if
 they had predicted and had been fully expecting such an occurance as the
 end of the world.  There was a place for us on the moon, where we would
 all be safe.  As for the earth, it was finished, ready to blow up.  We
 packed what we could carry and piled onto a school bus.  We drove down the
 deserted city streets.  The empty, dark, fast food drive though.  Past the
 movie theater with all its framed posters in front of the box office.
 No families would see the new Disney movie.  No couples would drown
 pathetically in the latest gooey romance.  No critics for the latest
 Tarantino movie.  And the popcorn was surely stale.

        Nearby, a yellow and grey van drove in circles by the bank.
 Nothing, not even Armageddon, would take them from their home.  They
 seemed indecisive though, as if they were torn between the pride to die
 for the earth that created them as evolution willed and the desire to
 prove the superiority of mankind by fleeing to another planet.  I gave a
 silent plea for them to save themselves, though I wondered why I even
 cared.  Perhaps it's looking at someone and knowing they are going to die.
 Maybe it's because I thought if the bus would stop for one second, I could
 say something to give them the desire to join us in our journey to our new
 home.  Instead, I helplessly gazed out at the van through the dusty bus
 window and said a silent goodbye.

        No spaceships for us; at least not that I recall.  Buses waiting for
 us at the moon as we transferred at the port.  The sky was incredibly dark
 with a reddish orange tint.  We hung our heads out the windows of the bus
 and cheered as the distant earth blew up before our eyes.  At last the
 anticipation was over.

        The new world seemed to be a large building.  My friends and I
 wandered around, playing with the change in gravity.  I wandered around
 what seemed like a department store.  With a startled glance upward, I
 saw eight feet tall mutations of human beings standing above me and
 chatting nonchalantly.  They didn't notice me, but I was afraid of them.
 They all had long, stringy black hair and piercing green eyes; they were
 like large gothic aliens.  I floated away as quietly as I could, and
 joined my friends in a movie theater.  Everyone stood up when the movie
 began.  More incredibly tall people stood in front of me, and I decided
 to continue exploring and skip the movie.

        I found myself in a room with various pianos and keyboards.  Most
 were being played elegantly by random talented musicians.  I looked for
 my own piano to play.  Some were missing keys, others only had black ones
 in the major key, no minor key reversed in white... some keys did not work
 on some, and some merely had buttons to push that made different sound
 effects that I could not begin to vary.

        I floated along in discouraged confusion, and silently wished for
 my home.

 SILVER AND GOLD by Oregano

        When Julia and Farago were in the car and out in traffic, Farago
 turned on the radio.  "Counting Crowes, you like them, right?" Asked
 Farago.

        "I like some of their stuff, you know the song I like," Julia
 replied, "otherwise I really don't care for them that much."

        "The one song with 'One for silver, two for gold...'."

        "Yes"

        Farago listened to the song.  "I think that part is coming up.
 Here it comes."

        Out of the radio came, "Are you happy where you're sleeping? Does
 he keep you safe and warm?"

        "Eww!  No!  This is not the song," said Julia, "Change the station,
 this is one of their songs that I emphatically do NOT like."

        Farago was negotiating traffic and it was about 15 seconds before he
 could bring his concentration back to the radio and as he did, as his
 fingers were about to press the next preset, out of the radio came, "One
 for silver, two for gold..."

        "Wait!  This is it, Farago, don't change it, this is the one
 I like."

 My THOUGHTS and FEELINGS on the DEAD OF HOE by Guy_SJS
 WRITTEN ON JULY 31, 2000 7:51PM

        I started out reading HOE about 6 months ago when I got a link from
 some textfiles site.  Since then I've been reading it religiously.  I told
 myself, "I need to write for them." The next day, I got the letter about
 them closing.  Now here's my final thoughts and whats going through
 my head right now as I think of HOE.

        Wait a second, I'm not allowed to think.  The techno-babbleing
 geektrons took my brain... Damn...  Well, here's a hearty thanks to the
 HOE crew, and a good luck to them in the future.  Mogel, you made a wise
 chost to end the legacy here rather than let it sink into a hole...

 This Year: A Social Waste / The Things Not Said
 A tribute to Karie, by Guy_SJS

        This school year has been a total waste to me.  I have spent most
 of my time studying for classes and on the computer, thus shutting out all
 forms of life except those people I have met online.  Sad.

	The one person I care about most is leaving for college in August.
 It came as a shock to me when I heard the news.  I can't imagine her going
 off to college.  Just isn't right.  She knows how I feel about her, I know
 she feels the same way.  We never really acted on our actions--too little
 too late.  I am taking her out for lunch Saturday.  I plan to tell her how
 I feel then and who knows, maybe something will happen.  Her college IS
 only an hour away... if she ever gets this file, I want her to know I
 love her.  Karie, I dedicate this file to you.

	Now, on to the others in my life.  My mother.  Wonderful woman.  We
 seldom argue and it is never really that bad anyways.  She is quite good
 with computers for her age (mid-50s). I was surprised she picked up so
 quick.  Then again, she IS smart.  She had me. :-)  Next up, Kate.  We
 worked together on a team for Science Olimpiad.  She was smart, very smart.
 Wish I had gotten to know her better.  I guess I still have time for this
 though.  She will be around for awhile anyways.  Good thing, she's nice to
 have around.  Always good for a cheer-up.  Ben and Nick.  Best guys on
 earth.  Very capable of getting something done.  Good with computers.
 Smart.  They will be there for awhile at least.  Next to Shauna.  Average
 girl, good looking, smart, dating a total prick (It's true!).  She and I
 were good friends when we were young.  It filtered off..  I wish it hadn't.
 I know she does now too.  Too bad, her boyfriend is a prick and I won't
 talk to her with him around.  Sad.  Oh well.

	Now on to teachers.  Who was cool, who is a prick.  Mr. Kalada: No
 comment.  Mr. Zurlo: Great guy.  Mrs. Napoli: Cool.  Mr. Hutchins: Best
 teacher! Woohoo!  This man knew how to teach.  And if you didn't
 understand it, he would take the time and sit down and help you understand
 it better.  He deserves a good human award.  Mr. Boje: cool teacher.
 Mrs. Perricciny:  Good.  Mrs. Chambers: Up with Mr. Hutchins.
 Mr. Carpino: LAME.

 NO FAT CHICKS by Kreid

        Every morning, Adam Burnself ate a pop tart, and drank a coke and a
 pint of motor oil on his way to school.  If he got there early, he would
 sleep until the first bell rang.  The other kids in the 7th grade liked to
 kick him in the gut, as he slept on the floor, and as they romped through
 the halls before school started.

        Adam had chemistry first period Monday through Friday, except
 for Wednesday, when the class was dropped.  Unlike the other kids in the
 class, Adam tried to sit in a different seat every morning.  Without fail,
 Adam would strike up a conversation with whomever he sat next to.

        "Hey."  Adam was usually ignored until he violently asserted
 himself.  "HEY!" he would repeat, and punch the boy or girl whom he sat
 next to.

        Here is an example of the conversation that would typically follow:

        "What do you want?!"

        "Hey.  I've been drinking a pint of motor oil every day."

        "Uh... okay... why...?"

        "It's called self-immoliation.  At the end of the year, I'm going to
 swallow a match and burst into flames."

        "What?  Why?"

        "Because nobody loves me, and I have nothing to live for."

        "Well, you've got a point there.  Loser."

        "You'll be sorry when I'm dead."

        "No I won't!"

        "Yes you will."

        "No, I won't."

        After Adam died, it was suggested that he had been crying for help,
 and trying to reach out for a long time.  The school psychologist even
 claimed that Adam never really wanted to die.  But unfortunately, everyone
 else did want Adam to die.  Some even prayed for it -- Adam's parents, for
 example, prayed for his death countless times, ever since they accidentally
 conceived him on spring break in Acapulco, 1985.

        One afternoon, Sidney, the 7th grade's token punk, made a mockery
 of Adam's cry for help.  "Hey Burnself!  I've been drinking half a bottle
 of vodka every morning!  It's called self-inebriation and at the end of the
 day I'm gonna puke on your shoes!"  Bystanders scoffed at both Sidney and
 Adam.  The 7th grade considered both of these outsiders pathetic.

        In fact, Sidney was the only kid around whose death was prayed for
 more often than Adam's.  Sidney was kicked out of school in his freshman
 year, and then he overdosed the next summer.  Incidentally, he got laid
 more before he was 16 than most of his classmates did in their entire
 lives.

        On the last day of school, Adam swallowed a match, but he didn't
 burst into flames.  Instead, he just burned his mouth and throat.  The
 class watched in disappointment as Adam failed in his first attempt at
 suicide.

        "That's okay, Adam," said the school psychologist.  "90% of suicide
 cases screw up on the first try."

        "This is horrible!" wailed Adam.  "All I want is for someone to love
 me!"  Wendy Dorklove watched with a tear in her eye; she had a crush on
 Adam since the 6th grade.

        "I love you, Adam!" screamed Wendy.

        The crowd was silenced by this shocking display of emotion.  There
 was a long, silent pause.

        "Uh," spoke Adam, "let me rephrase that.  All I want is for someone
 to love me -- and no fat chicks!"

        The scene erupted with laughter.  For the rest of the school year
 (which was only a few hours), Adam was the funniest, and thereby most
 popular kid in the 7th grade.  At the end of the day, Wendy Dorklove went
 home and ate herself to death.

        Adam relished in his popularity.  For once, he felt loved.  He was
 part of the 'in' crowd.  His life was only beginning, he had a great future
 ahead of him.  Tragically, he killed himself with a bottle of bleach after
 his mom sentenced him to clean the kitchen that summer, as punishment for
 getting caught in the garage fucking future prom queen, Alice Mankiller.

        Currently, Adam Burnself's grave holds the state record in Alabama
 for being pissed on.  His gravestone speaks a tale of a tragic, confused
 life.  It reads:

 ADAM BURNSELF
 BORN OCT 11 1986
 DIED JULY 3 2000

 I think most of you are a bunch of no-life , alternative , freaks who just
 couldn't fit in with normal people , so now you all live your lives and
 say ohh yes.. we aren't freaks, we just don't want to conform to society.
 Well this is what I say.. TOO bad.. Society is always going to push aside
 outcasts and freaks like most of you.. if you can't learn to be socially
 acceptable you aren't going to make it anywhere. You could be smarter,
 quicker.. whatever.. but I bet you the person who is normal who society
 accepts will get what you want.. and you will be left behind untill you
 conform.. there is no way around it eveyone eventully conforms to
 something.  So learn to live with criticism against yourselves. It's not
 like I hate any of you it's just that you are all stuck up in your little
 bbs ways..and when someone fitting the norm comes about you attack.. and
 try to scare them off.. well it might benifit a bunch of no-lifes modem
 geeks to listen to others once in awhile even if it is against your
 alternitive ways.

 THE REAL WORLD, LIFE FULL OF IDIOTS by Kaotik

        All my life I have spent alot of time pondering about everything,
 the world and our strange minds.  What makes us tick?  If we look back at
 what has been happening in our personal lives lately it will all look
 strange.  I stopped in at Macs (corner store) the other day to buy a
 slushy cause all I had was 75cents.  As I get out of my car I noticed a
 few kids from the elementary school across the road approching me,
 "Excuse me sir, can you buy us smokes?".  Most people would say no,
 seeing that these kids were about 8 years old, but me being a corrupt
 individual, I figured oh well, I might as well spoil the next generation,
 maybe they'll all die before they become 20 or something.  I went into the
 store, bought the smokes and behold, the guy in the store is telling me
 that the price of the slushy is 1.50$!  When I was a kid they were 25
 cents.  Who the hell pays 1.50$ for ice and flavor.  So I just left gave
 the kid his smokes and went home.  Sometimes also when i drive by these
 schools and I see all the innocent kids playing during recess, My mind
 kinda wonders off.  They are having all sorts of fun now, but the sad
 part is that they don't realize how fucked up the world is till they get
 older.  I kinda feel sorry for them in a way.

        The next day my car stops working.  I figured it was the tranny and
 took it to a place called "AAMCO" a transmission specialist or so they say!
 The stupid assholes charged me 150$ to take apart my tranny to tell me what
 I told them, it was broken.  To add insult to injury they wanted 1100$ to
 fix it, they guy said the parts were about 850$, when I called Honda, they
 said the parts would be 325$.  Obviously these idiots at "AAMCO" were
 trying to rip me off.  I told them to fuck off and gimmie my car back,
 they put my tranny in the trunk and I got it towed to another shop and it
 should be ready in a few days.  The moral of this bit is, don't take your
 car to AAMCO unless you have too much money you don't know what to do with.

        Toronto, the big city of dreams.  The Canadian version of New York,
 better roads, cleaner, less dead people, just a nice place to be, ok, well
 kind of.  Toronto is getting stranger and stranger.  The Provice of
 Ontario in which Toronto is located in, is now topless!  You can go around
 topless (women of course) on beaches and rollerblading and shit without
 getting busted.  Good idea, in a way.  Who wants to see old chicks and fat
 chicks walking around topless.  I think that fat and ugly chicks should
 have to get a permit for leaving the house.  Another thing is that the
 people whose jobs are to provide us with education want to strike over a
 really stupid restructure of the Ontario Education System.  Bill 160 will
 have students be at school longer, start earlier and will have almost no
 summer.  I don't care cause I am not in school, but still kids will just
 rebel and start dropping out and there will be more whinos downtown asking
 for change.

        My parents often wondered about the people that I hang out with and
 now I can see why.  This guy Steve we know, got kicked the fuck outta his
 house a while back and was staying with Pimpdaddy Leroy, our local pimp
 hero for a while.  Steve wanted Leroy to cut his hair and knowing Leroy,
 you wouldn't want him near you with a shaver but nope, Steve didn't think
 first.  To get to the point, Steve ended up walking around town with his
 girlfriends initials in big ol' letters shaved into his fucking head.  We
 laughed, they laughed, everybody laughed.  We tried to get a picture to
 attach to the mag but after a week or so he ended up shaving it.  doh!

        Before I decide to end this, just a few things that I often
 wonder.  Why does everyone want to become a refugee and move to Canada?
 We have enough fucking taxis, who needs 7-11 anymore, does it suprise me
 that I have to pay taxes to pay welfare for all these wack-offs that can't
 speak english but like wearing my curtains and getting free money?  We
 don't care if you get killed here either, go home.  Also why do those
 women liberation broads always want to be equal?  I never see them sitting
 at home watching the football game and talking about getting laid.  Women
 liberation is one big fucking joke, we have the penis, we rock, you can't
 drive, give it up.

        Well anywayz, there is some shit off my mind.  Hope it was good
 for you aswell.

 "Julz and Her Constant Rambling"

        Earlier today, I strolled into a nearby Toys 'r' Us, to find a
 rather funny display. It was a big sign that said "Get Your Hand on a
 Hot Flash Barbie TODAY" Then below were the details...brace yourselves;
 Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her face turn beet red while tiny
 drops of perspiration magicallyappear on her forehead. Comes with
 hand-held fan and tiny tissues.

        And then, don't forget "Facial Hair Barbie"; As Barbie's hormone
 levels shift, watch her whiskers grow! Availble with teensy tweezers and
 magnifying mirror). Also, my personal favorite out of all of them,
 "Recovery Barbie".  Too many Discos and what not have finally caught up
 with the ultimate party girl. Now she does Twelve Steps instead of dance
 steps. All cleaned up and ober, she's going to meetings religiously.
 Comes with a little copy of The Big Book and a six-pack of Diet Coke.

        Just before I was about to leave the store...in a fit of...i don't
 know quite what...I see "Blow-Job Barbie". I think I should stop before I
 blow some chunks....no, I'll control it...she comes with a hand held dildo,
 and her mouth is in the shape of an "o" for convient sucking. She has the
 ability to spit or swallow---your decision. Watch out girls, if you're not
 careful, imitating Barbie may end up in a trip to the ol' stomach pumper.

        And that's all i have to say folks........goodnight!!!!

 THE RETURN OF SATAN's CHILD by Effy

        Author's Note: To experience the full intensity of this sequel, I
 suggest you first read the prequel, which can be found in HOE #598.

                               !_Part One_!

        Well, what happened with Tim seemed to put an end to Sara's insane
 rampage of men for awhile...but when she was released from the mental
 institution, it was only a treacherous beginning for her.

	You may be wondering why she was released.  She was after all,
 _insane_, and talked only in devil tongue.  Well, I was part of the reason
 she got out so easily.  I helped make her speak English again, and start
 to act like her old, normal, self.  I always sensed though that the demons
 in her were not truly silent.  God, was I was right about that too.

        It wasn't easy to get Sara to act even half way human again.  In
 fact, it took months of stressful visits that took up all of my free time.
 In fact, Sara  and I both worked so damn hard that when she finally got
 out of that padded room, we hadn't  shaved our legs in three months or
 done our laundry, and Sara just stunk to high heaven  because she wouldn't
 bathe; she'd just sit there practicing her English.  Her white room  had
 turned a strange yellow-greenish color.  I honestly suspect that the
 doctors let her go because she just left such a mess and smelled too damn
 bad...

	Anyway, when I got Sara back home, the first thing I did was send
 her straight upstairs to take a bath.  As I sat downstairs waiting for
 her, I thought it would be a good idea for us to get out of the house and
 have some fun; I mean we hadn't had any in months, like since we abducted
 Tim (who at this time was across the street locked up in his room mumbling
 strange things about Fang, the dog in Sara's yard).

	Sara yelled for me to come upstairs suddenly.  I ran upstairs,
 seeing her brushing her hair in the bathroom.  One glance into the bathtub
 was enough to make me wanna puke.  I'd never seen so much leg hair
 before...

        Anyway, that is irrelevant to the material of the story.  "Sara," I
 began, "don't you think we should go do something, you know, have a little
 fun?"

	Sara looked at me and raised her thin, arching eyebrow.  It looked
 like a scraggly, thin cat arching it's crooked, oily back.  "What do you
 wanna do?"  she asked, tossing out a dozen hair-filled razors.

        "Well," I began, "there's a basketball game tonight that we could
 go to.  It's at least something to do..."

	To my surprise, Sara looked delighted.  It was decided.  We would
 go to the game.

                               !_Part Two_!

	When we arrived at the school, the game was already half way into
 the first quarter.  We talked to a few friends (who were astonished at
 Sara's presence), and headed into the gym to find a place to sit.

        It wasn't long before I noticed Sara eyeing someone.  All I could
 think to myself was "Who?" and "Oh no."

        Finally, curiosity got the better of me.  "Who the hell are you
 staring at?"  I asked her.  She was looking at a big group of 8th graders
 and a few freshmen.

        "What a cutie," Sara murmured to herself, her hands gnarling into
 small fists and her face filling with blushing delight.  Her blue eyes
 grew large and lit up like two blue Christmas bulbs that had short
 circuited and were blazing on fire.

        "Where?"  I asked, wanting to know who the poor guy was.

        "There," she rasped, pointing a long, skinny finger at someone.

        "Him?!?!"  I asked, looking at the short, scrawny, greasy-haired,
 blonde kid with glasses.  "Charlie?"

        "That's his name?"  Sara said, grinning evilly.  "How CUTE."

	I _tried_ to see things from her point of view, I honestly did.
 But I didn't see the cuteness in the grease ball on top of his neck, the
 big glasses perched on his skinny nose, the scrawny body, and the thin
 legs that looked like they belonged to a chicken.

	That look in her eyes was no stranger to me.  It was the same look
 she had when she was in love with Tim, but it was before she planned to
 desecrate Tim.  Poor Charlie, I thought.  He was in for deep fruity cacka
 if he did anything wrong or even got involved with her.

        At this time, Jill, an eighth grader that was the sister of one of
 Sara's ex-boyfriends, Jared (who the cops thought the charred remains in
 Sara's basement belonged to) came and sat by us.  She wasn't angry with
 Sara for possibly killing her brother.  In fact, no one was.  Everyone was
 overjoyed.

        Anyway, she glanced in the direction Sara was gaping at.  "Do you
 want Charlie?" she asked in surprise.  She looked at the freshmen chicken
 and then back at Sara.

        Sara didn't answer.  She was just staring in awe at the bony piece
 of white meat sitting on the bleachers across the gym.  I answered for her.
 "Yeah," I said, secretly pitying poor Charlie.

        Jill looked amused.  "Let's go talk to him," she said, grabbing our
 hands and pulling us in the direction of the group.  I followed
 reluctantly.  Sara was all flushed with excitement as she fluffed her hair
 and straightened her shirt and picked her wedgie.

        Jill introduced Sara and Charlie.  It was all she needed to do.
 Sara flirted madly like a crazy lil' woman, and Charlie took the bait like
 a hungry little fish.

	Three days later, they were going out.

        That's where the hell began.

                              !_Part Three_!

	Now when Sara gets a new boyfriend, she goes through phases.  First
 is the gushing part about how cute he is, and how much she is in love with
 him, how they were meant for each other...that phase lasts about seven to
 ten days.  I put up with that OK.  It kept her in a just peachy (not
 fruity, mind you) mood, even though all the talk about the skinny little
 chicken Charlie got kind of annoying and I found myself avoiding the house
 whenever we had chicken for supper.

        A couple weeks after they started going out, Sara began to complain.
 It all started when I was at her house Wednesday night and she was gabbing
 on the phone with Charlie.

        "Do you love me?"  she asked him, twirling the phone cord around her
 finger, like talons gripping prey.  Her eyes were wide and staring at the
 floor as she tapped the ashes off her cigarette.  She'd started the habit
 again after she got out of the mental institution.

        A machine gun giggle came rattling out of the phone.  Sara's eyes
 narrowed and she breathed into the phone.  The giggle came again.  I hoped
 that Charlie never joined the army and got stuck in combat because his
 troop would all dive for cover if he began laughing in the middle of
 battle, and their side would lose on the attack.  Maybe if he showed up at
 a recruiter's office, they'd kick him out the door the minute they heard
 him laugh and the United States wouldn't have to worry about losing a
 major war.

        Sara looked a little less peachy; the fruit was drying out of her.
 She gripped the phone tighter and her bony knuckles turned white.  "Well?"
 she rasped.  "Are you going to answer me?"

        There came silence from the phone.  Perhaps Charlie was thinking.
 Or laughing in his head.  Who knows?

        Sara was losing her patience.  I couldn't hear anything else from
 Charlie's end of the phone after that, but apparently it was a lot of
 machine gun giggles and  somewhat Tim-like talking, because Charlie really
 didn't say a lot.  Only Charlie made more noises and grunts than Tim, who
 just used several repetitive phrases.

	When the conversation was over, Sara hung up the phone in
 frustration.  "What a dumbass."  She shook her head back and forth, her
 hair shagging out to the sides and a frown on her face and her eyes
 closed.  A sinister grin slowly crept up her mouth though.  I knew that
 grin.  I hoped Charlie started talking, _fast_

                               !_Part Four_!

	A week and two days later, on that Friday, Sara had a few friends
 over.  It was her, Charlie, Kenny, and me.  We all hung out in her room
 upstairs and listened to music while the guys made idiots of themselves,
 and Sara and I watched them in amusement.  That went on for the rest of
 the night.

	The next morning, while Charlie was still asleep, Sara and Kenny
 stole Charlie's clothes except for his boxers.

	We were all giggling madly when Charlie poked his disheveled,
 greasy head out of the blankets on the floor.  His sleepy eyes contained
 little intelligence.  Suddenly he realized he was almost naked and his
 eyes grew wide.

        "Where's my clothes?" he grunted, covering himself and his Green Bay
 Packers boxers better.

        We just smiled.  "I don't know," Kenny said.

        "Me neither," I said.

        "I have no idea," Sara added, smiling innocently.

	Charlie wanted to look for his clothes.  He began sliding across
 the wooden floor, slipping and sliding his way wrapped up in his blanket,
 slithering in an invisible trail of mucus.

        "He looks like a slug," Kenny commented, and Sara, him, and I burst
 into laughter madly.

        "Slug," Sara said.  "It's your new nickname."  She grinned hugely.

	Poor Slug.  Later on his nickname would contribute to his fate.

                               !_Part Five_!

	Slug was starved for ciggies.  It seemed that all he wanted to do
 was smoke when he was around Sara.  He was like a chimney.  If he had been
 big, he would've had to watch out for Santa Claus come Christmas time
 because Santa da man could see that chimney all the way from the North
 Pole smoking up a storm.  I never understood how they said Santa could go
 down chimneys in December.  Wouldn't there be a fire burning in them?
 Santa would be smokin' up man, and I don't mean a joint.  That could be a
 new worldly source of energy.  Burn Santa's fat.  Anyway, I am so off the 
 subject that I'm going to have to forfeit Christmas to get back into the
 story.

        Anyway, Slug's constant asking for cigarettes began to grate on
 Sara's touchy nerves.   In fact, touchy isn't the word for her nerves.  You
 upset her nerves and she becomes Satan's little girl.  I mean, we already
 heard about Tim.  Who's to say it couldn't happen again?

	Sara and I were sitting in her room.  Slug had just left, satisfied
 with his cigarette.

        Sara looked like her thoughts were further away than the North Pole.
 "Hand me my cigarettes," she behest.

        I picked up the pack of Marbs and tossed em to her.  "Here," I
 said.  I got a strange sense of deja vu.

        "My lighter too," she said, not touching the pack yet.

        "Here," I said, giving her the lighter.  The feeling grew stronger,
 like Santa getting fatter as he eats his Christmas feast.  I began to have
 a sense of unreality.  I was like a broken Christmas record.  I knew what
 had happened last time that I had kept saying "here" to her...she went off
 her rocker minutes later.

	Sara looked at the ceiling absently and fingered around her for her
 pack of ciggies.  She found them and tried to empty one into her hand.
 Nothing came out.  She shook the box.  Nothing came out.  She shook it
 harder and finally madly, up and down, up and down, till the pack was a
 reddish-white blur.  I looked at her in alarm, but she didn't even know I
 was in the room.  Her eyes were huge and looming; they reminded me of Icy
 Hot.  Cool blue smoldering flames.

        "That fuckhead," she said, crumpling the pack in her fist tightly.
 "He took my last smoke."  Her knuckles were white.

        "Oh come on, it's not that big of a deal..." I began.

        "Yes it is!" Sara screamed, throwing the pack at me.  I dodged it
 and stared at her until I thought my eyes were going to pop out so she
 could gleefully squish them between her gnarled fingers.

	Sara carried on, her face becoming a pasty white with red splotches
 on her cheeks.  "He just steals my cigarettes, he hardly ever talks, he
 never says he loves me, and that LAUGH, oh my fuck, it's SO annoying...it
 sounds like a machine gun...eh eh eh eh eh eh eh..." she said, doing a
 perfect imitation of Slug's giggle.  Her eyes grew wider until she looked
 like a bug, the eyes consuming the whole face, but yet a thousand eyes.
 Sara was like a big pile of eyes...it's all I could see.  Everything else
 seemed to disappear and all I could see were two huge, blue eyes that
 seemed to grow redder and redder...soon they were red, and just like when
 she had gone off about Tim.

        I shrunk back towards the wall in fear.  I didn't want to become
 her victim before Slug did...

	Sara stood up slowly.  She stood over me, seemed to tower...she
 spoke to me then...her voice was quiet and a bit raspy.  "Slug has picked
 the wrong person to fuck with," she began, in a strangely serene voice.
 She absently toyed with her lighter.  "He needs to learn a lesson."

        "Wh-wh-what kind of lesson?" I stuttered, shivering.

        Sara ignored me.  "You helped me last time," she said, grinning
 madly.  "You helped me with Tim!"  She looked at the wall as if she could
 see through it to Tim's house, where he surely was up in his room, rocking
 back and forth insanely, still clasping Fang's fur, which by this time
 would be turning gray with age.

        Sara went on.  "You are going to help me again.  Slug is going to 
 PAYYYYY..."

        I had to listen to her.  It was the end for me if I didn't.  I
 slowly nodded.

	She grinned even bigger, her teeth becoming huge and luminous, all
 I could see were those two huge eyes and a gargantuous grinning mouth full
 of teeth, an insane combination Satan had prepared for her...oh my god,
 I thought, Satan's child is back.

                               !_Part Six_!

        Yes indeed, Satan's Child was back, and she was worse than ever.
 She was back to desecrate Slug of all people for not talking to her, using
 her, you name it...Sara spent most of her time before we carried out the
 new plan at home, smoking pack after pack of Marlboros, and giggling madly
 at her master plan to bring Slug down.  Whenever I went over to her house,
 she just sat Indian style with a cigarette in her shaky hand, a big toothy
 grin on her face, and her eyes wide and unblinking.  Every now and then
 little giggles escaped from her pulsating lips.  She didn't say much to me
 except what I  had to do and what would happen to me if I didn't do it,
 but I won't go into that for the  sake of your stomach.

        After Satan repossesed his daughter's body (Sara's body), Sara and I 
 planned to carry out our plan a week later.  I was to report to her house
 a couple hours ahead of time so we could call Charlie and get him to come
 over.

        When I arrived, I didn't find Sara in her room surprisingly.  I
 looked around and finally found her in the backyard, picking weeds.

           "What are you doing?" I asked her, as casually as I could sound.

	   Sara looked up at me, her brown hair disheveled and greasy, her
 teeth peering out of her little grin, her blue eyes evil and empty.  She
 let out a low growl.  "Cumma poot dah mokita Creeping Charlie!" she said
 happily.

           "Oh, you're picking Creeping Charlie plants," I said, smiling.
 Like I said at the beginning of the story, I could understand her devil
 tongue, which she had begun talking in again.  I noted that the dress she
 was wearing was weaved out of Creeping Charlie.  I could see little slugs
 plopping off of the dress, and as they did, Sara crushed them beneath her
 bare heel with a satisfied "plop" and an evil laugh.

           "What do we need them for?"  I asked, not wishing to converse
 in devil tongue.

           This time Sara spoke in English.  "Tie up Slug."  She grinned
 hideously, her teeth like candy corn again, only some were missing from
 her banging her head repeatedly against the wall.

           "Don't we have rope for that?"  I inquired, holding out the
 length of rope.

           "Bung monny toophoo cocka venovelim!  Zoowingtowa!"  she rasped,
 her tongue slipping in and out of her mouth as she lisped the words out
 like a snake.  She meant that it was more concurring with the plan to use
 Creeping Charlie to tie up Slug.

	   Sara looked away, absorbed in her thoughts.  She picked slugs
 absently off the Creeping Charlie plants and popped them into her mouth
 and chewed slowly.  She offered me the plant delightfully, but I resisted.
 As evil as I could be sane, I still couldn't bring myself to eat slugs.

	   Sara dropped some more slugs onto the pavement and crushed them
 and smashed them all over the concrete.  She got down on her hands and
 knees and began licking them up with her forked tongue.  Her eyes gleamed
 delightfully.  I noticed a neighbor staring at her from his window next
 door.  His face was stark white.  Sara slowly turned her head to stare at
 the man, slugs dripping from her lips.  The man stared back in raw terror.
 Sara opened her mouth and screamed directly at the man, and he fled from
 the window screaming bloody murder.  Sara began to laugh insanely.  "Plop
 plop plop," as slugs dripped from her mouth.  I'd never seen so many slugs
 before at one time.  Perhaps it was some workings of the devil.

	   When Sara was satisfied with her dinner, she grabbed the
 Creeping Charlie plants she had picked and put them by the shed.  Fang
 sniffed at them curiously, and then the little white dog, barely bigger
 than a rat, growled and barked at Sara.  She had purposely not fed him in
 days.  Fang began to gnaw on the slugs on the Creeping Charlie.

	   We went inside to call Slug.  Sara picked up the phone and
 dialed the number, and I could tell when he answered because her eyes
 darkened mercilessly and a devilish little smile spread on her face like
 Move Over Butter on toast.

           "Charlie," she said in a smooth, yet raspy voice, "what are you
 doing tonight?"

	   Mumbles came out of the phone and a machine gun giggle or two.

           "Well ask her," Sara growled, saliva dripping onto the carpet.  I 
 removed my socks; I didn't want to get them soaked, as the puddle of drool
 inched closer.  I jumped onto the couch to avoid it.

	   Sara appeared to be waiting for a response.  Then she spoke
 seductively.  "I'll give you a cigarette or two," she whispered, like she
 was promising to lay him or something.  Slug probably would've preferred
 the cigarettes anyway though.

           Suddenly her face filled with delight.  "Ok," she said, almost
 sounding normal.  "Bye honey," she said, hanging up the phone.  She slowly
 turned toward me.  A feeling of deja vu came over me, which was not an
 unfamiliar feeling I'd been having lately.

           "Let's get this show on the road," she said lightly, lighting
 pieces of her hair on fire.  She growled in delight as her hair sizzled
 between her fingers.  I felt as I had felt a long time before, when Tim
 came a'knocking at the door...

                              !_Part Seven_!

	   Slug sat happily on the couch, pufffing on his cigarette and
 gazing off into space with a "duh" expression on his face.  Sara gazed at
 him as though he were all that existed in the world.

           "Do you like my dress?" she asked him, twisting a strand of
 Creeping Charlie around her long, skinny finger.

           Slug looked at Sara's dress.  He didn't say anything at first,
 but then a slight machine-gun giggle escaped from his mouth.  He mumbled
 something unintelligible.

           Sara's eyes narrowed in anger and despise.  "You don't like it,"
 she growled. "Zoowingtowa!"  she rasped.

        Slug's sleepy eyes widened at her rasping devil voice, but he
 continued not to say anything.  Another rattling giggle slipped out of his
 mouth, like a slug out of the ground.

           A low growl came from the bottom of Sara's throat.  I could see
 her fists gnarling into tight, white balls, like two cabbages sitting in
 her lap on the ends of her wrists.  Her face became a firey red, and her
 blue eyes began to turn purple, then maroon.  I looked at her in warning.
 She looked back at me as though I were made of glass, and then seemed to
 control her anger, and relaxed.

           "Would you like another cigarette?"  she asked Slug.

           Slug's face lit up like a candle.  And if he was a candle, his
 brain must've melted a long time ago and all that was there was the tiny
 wick, his brain stem.  No intelligence.  Just the stem, enough to get by.
 No wonder he liked smoking so much.  He needed fire to light the wick, the
 brain stem, the source of his entire being.

           "Uh huh," he said, holding out his hand eagerly.

           "Come outside and I'll give it to you," she urged, taking Slug's
 tiny hand gently.  I wondered if what they said about hand size was true
 because if it was, Sara would have to be careful not to snap that thing
 off if she nudged it.  And I know more than nudging would become of it...

           Slug looked confused.  "Why outside?" he asked.

	   Sara smiled, her candy corn teeth popping out at him like two
 rows of tombstones yellowed with age.  "Just because," she whispered.  Her
 voice seemed to be a million miles away.  She got up and pulled Slug behind
 her out the door.  I followed, my hands in my pockets, and whistled
 cheerfully.

	   Once outside, Sara guided us down the walk towards the shed
 where Fang was kept.  Slug's giggles rattled at the small, white, ratty
 dog.  I deftly reached for the pile of Creeping Charlie, still dripping
 with slugs.

	   Sara gave Slug his cigarette, lit it for him, and backed away a
 few feet.  Slug puffed away happily, his eyes closed.

	   Sara looked at me.

           I grabbed Slug's wrists and began to bind them behind his back.
 Sara grabbed his ankles and did the same.  Slug dropped his cigarette and
 struggled, but soon we had him on the ground tied up.  He tried to reach
 for his cigarette on the sidewalk a few feet away; I couldn't believe it!
 But soon he began to scream.  Sara silenced him when she stuffed some
 Creeping Charlie plants in his mouth, the weeds full of slugs.  She also
 stuffed a shitload of the weeds down the front of his jeans.  He gagged and 
 moaned but was no match for us.  We dumped him in the shed, locked Fang in
 there with him, and we were overcome with glory at having brought for the
 second time, someone's demise due to Fang.  Fang's hungry drool seeped out
 from underneath the door.

                                !_Part Eight_!

	   Yes indeed, it seems that we had done something quite as well as
 we had done it before, with slight alterations in the plan.  Needless to
 say, Fang had a small feast...he began gnawing at the slugs down Slug's
 pants and bit something off that he probably shouldn't have...well, that
 little piece of meat didn't satisfy Fang, so he began to work on various
 parts of Slug's body, which included his nose, ears, and mouth.  Poor Slug,
 he was incredibly deformed.

   	But what happened to everyone?  Well, Fang broke out of the shed a 
 couple days later and dragged poor Slug down to Riverside Park and
 continued to gnaw at him, where the cops found him and Fang that night.
 They didn't know what had really happened to Slug, but Fang was sentenced
 to death and was given a lethal injection for distemperment.  Poor Fang.
 That was the end of his adventures with Sara and me.

	   And Slug?  Well, he was taken to the hospital and stayed there
 for a couple weeks, recovering from shock and nic fits.  He was given
 plastic surgery big time and now looks really fucked up.  Unfortunately,
 they weren't able to replace his missing "organ," because they didn't
 exactly have a donor, and they didn't want to attach one molded of plastic.
 Poor Slug now resides in Boscobel's psych ward, but he should be getting
 out soon.  He gets to go visit friends every now and then, but runs
 screaming whenever they offer him a cigarette.  If anything, Sara and I
 helped him kick that habit.

	   And what happened to Sara?  She is living happily at home, her
 anger replaced with giddy happiness.  The demons have not left her, but
 no one has pissed her off yet.  She still talks in devil tongue and hears
 strange voices, but it seems to be fading a little.  We go out and do
 things and have fun, and she now has a new boyfriend named Mike; he's from
 Boscobel.  She seems to be crazy about him...for now.  I thought if Mike
 knew what he could be getting into.  You can never be too careful after
 all, especially when you're dealing with THE DEVIL.

 Subject: Fun ways to make some money

 About a two months ago I needed a lot of money but didn't want to
 work for it... so I sat down and thought about easy ways to get it.  Here
 are some of the least boring ways I came up with.  Some if this stuff is
 illegal, I'm not encouraging it, etc, so if you try it and get caught,
 don't blame me.

        1. Steal stuff

 Pretty obvious really, but it depends on what you steal and how you steal
 it. Wait til around 2 in the morning, go into a gas station (preferably
 not one you usually go to) when they are selling pokemon cards, wait until
 the sole attendant is distracted, grab the boxes of cards they have on the
 counter and get the fuck out of there.  Pull some shelving over as you
 are making your exit so the attendant will be distracted.  Sell the card
 packs to little kids later on.

        2. Steal more stuff

 Look round the place for empty houses, break into them, steal any stuff
 (furniture, washing machines, TVs etc) you find and sell it.  Relatively
 low risk as long as you can break windows quietly.  Use glass cutters or
 do it during a storm.

        3. Sell fake drugs

 Go to teenage raves with heaps of caffeine pills and sell them as speed or
 ecstasy to 14 year olds.  Good profit and probably not illegal.  By the
 time they work out your scam you're probably long gone, and if they do
 what the fuck are they gonna do about it?  You could also sell dried lawn
 clippings as marijuana but most kids that age just aren't
 stupid/inexperienced enough to fall for it.

 Of these three methods, the last is by far the easiest and carries the
 lowest risk.  Its certainly the most profitable ;)

 GANGSTA STORY by Big Daddy Bill

	The breeze seemed cautious in Dubuque that day. It whistled calmly
 through Scott's hair, as he lay motionless on the barron cement playground
 that children had played a competitive game of basketball on only hours
 before.  The ant population could care less, and they crawled anonymously
 over Scott's blood-streaked face, a line of the black warriors forming
 over the gaping hole that was put in his skull only moments ago. Yes,
 Scott was dead, very dead. And the bastard deserved it.
	Scott was meandering down the street, looking for trouble, as all
 little shits named Scott will do at one point or another, when he
 discovered a group of milato, latino, and caucasion teenage boys playing a
 hard game of b-ball in the Audubon School parking lot. Scott said to
 himself "straight pimpin'" and started to venture towards the teens.
	Scott threw up the 'dub as he approached, double checking to make
 sure his NYC black ball cap was cocked 30' degrees to the right. One of the
 latino boys took a glance at Scott, then another glance, before tapping his
 friends arm at the obese, be-bopping whiteboy limping towards them. "Que to
 infierno..?" the young mexican pondered, starring in disbelief.
	"Ay yo trip, I be bout it up in this real, got a bill ona count I
 can broady all ya'll mothafuckaz" Scott spouted out arrogantly, flashing
 some greenback he had stuffed in his front jean pocket. Scott slid his
 hands down to his balls and gave them a squeeze, snorting some air in
 through his nose like he just got done doing a line.
	The shirtless, obviously very fit milato's mouth fell open at the
 fat man's lingo, and all six of the men followed suit. "Yo, I saw ya'll
 cold hoopin' it, so cut a nigga some cheese." Scott finished, once again
 'dubbin' the six teens.
        The spanish teen spoke first, "'cuz, that ducat ain't biz in D-town,
 shit-talkin' get yo cap peeled." And with that spoken word, Scott heard to
 his left the *shik-shak* of a nine being prepped. Scott knew he was out of
 his league, and wished to god that he could geese the fuck outta there.
	"Spread those ends, dun." the bulky milato spoke up, as his homeboy 
 approached from the sidelines, gat in hand and cocked for action. Suddenly,
 the milato's face got very serious. "Busta's that fake jack's get laid on
 they backs." he ended the conversation with that, snatching the wad of
 bills that Scott extended towards him, almost as if in peace.
	"This playa be G'd up, gaffled in this game now ain't cha." the
 caucasion spoke stupidly, misinterpreting some of the things the more
 fortunate had to say. The milato simply turned, and laid the back of his
 hand against the little bitch's dome.
	"Shut the fuck up, cracka." the milato angrily retorted, and turned
 in time just to see fat man Scott make a dash for the farside.
	"We was highside, 'cuz, now that cracka made a dash for the
 mothafucka Five-O!" the mexican spat out, snagging the piece that the
 black man held idely in his hand.
	Coldly but smoothly, the latino gangster took careful aim and
 squeezed a shot off, then a second one, before turning and scattering
 away with the other hardcore teens like roaches do when you turn the
 lights on in an black man's apartment in the ghetto.
	Scott never got the chance to alert the police, nor did he ever
 get the chance to breath again, reproduce, eat vegetables, drink beer, or 
 masterbate.
	Moral of the story: A nicker newjack can boost phat up in D-town,
 but that O.P.P shit'll get that oowop ratatatating 'fo a nigga can
 represent n roll up in a saggin duece, stackin that double nine-nine, an'
 snack up some scrilla.
	One.

 PRINCE NAMOR IN THE LAND OF LaLaLa by The BMC

        The people of the Grand Duchy of Atlantis thought Namor had fled the
 city of night, but they were wrong.  He was kidnapped by the Mind
 Creatures.  "Where are you taking me?" said a confused Namor as they
 hoisted him upon their dozens of little pink shoulders.  They just giggled
 in response.  Namor realized the futility of attempting escape, shrugged
 his shoulders, and let himself fall asleep as he was carried into another
 world.

        When he woke up he saw a sign that said, "Welcome to the Land of
 LaLaLa, pop. 0."  Population zero?  Well then who was it that brought him
 here?  He didn't know.  They were gone and he was laying on a cloud with
 a golden cape covering his naked paralyzed body.  Namor quaffed a potion
 that allowed him to be free from his paralysis, stood up, folded the cape,
 and put it in his pocket.  "This will be worth a pretty penny at the Great
 Sea Bazaar," he believed to himself.  He didn't need money, though.  He
 was the King of Atlantis, or so he said.  

        That was the last thing he remembered.  Proteus launched a siege
 attack on Atlantis, Namor was declared King by the dying Poseidon, and
 then a bunch of little furry red guys carried him away.  "What does it all
 mean?" thought Namor as he kicked his feet up on the desk.  He didn't know.
 He didn't even know where to start.

        Namor continued to walk until he found a babbling brook.  He looked
 down at and said, "So, brook, what is it that you do for a living?"  The
 brook said nothing, because it was inanimate.  For some reason, this made
 Namor even more furious and he began kicking and punching the water until
 all his hands were wet and sore.  It was actually just one kick and one
 punch, but Namor was not really all that strong.  To his satisfaction he
 had defeated the babbling brook, and now onward he went to the mysterious
 destination that he had been questing for since a week earlier.

        He walked through a large red archway made of gelatin, and on the
 other side was a grassy meadow.  Namor ran out into the middle of the field
 and gazed around at all of the tall trees made of oak and maple.  "I've
 never been in a coniferous forest before," thought Namor, and he was right.
 When he got out of the brook he went onward through a large archway that
 was made of red gelatin.

        "Oh my sweet gelatinous cube," dreamed Namor, "I remember the
 tender love you gave me on our first date."  Now it was time for Namor to
 choose the path that would guide his direction for the rest of his life.
 One of them would lead to certain death, and the other would lead to
 uncertain death.  Namor noted this and decided to stay still and follow
 neither path in hopes of avoiding death altogether.  It didn't work,
 though.  All of a sudden the music sped up and a message popped up on the
 screen that said "Hurry Up!"

        Oh so this was how it was going to be, was it?  Was all of life just
 a game?  If so, Namor wanted to make sure he had lots of quarters so he
 could continue over and over again.  He thought about the silver cape in
 his jacket pocket and thought, "I'm going to trade this in for ALLLLLLLLL
 quarters!

        He didn't actually get all quarters with it though. he got some
 bubble gum and a ceramic parachuting clown and some stick-on tattoos.  He
 did keep three or four quarters, though.  He figured he would just get more
 change when life was about to end.  This is just like how people expect to
 change into a better person later in life.  Later is always in the future,
 even when death is in the present.  Namor knew all about Death.  Death was
 no stranger to Atlantis.  In fact, Namor had dined with Death on a few
 occasions, and he even had a ceramic mug that was given to him by Death.
 It said "Government of Atlantis, Department of Death."  That Death had a
 really weird sense of humour.  He wasn't the grim reaper or the specter of
 death, but just a non-magical cod whose parents happened to give him a
 weird name.  Namor still liked him, though.  Death Death Death Death Death
 Death.

        So he headed down one of the roads (I forget which, so let's hope
 it isn't important to the story) in search of some kind of death, and not
 his friend Death, either.  On the way down the road, he did see his friend
 Death, and he was hitchhiking on the side of the road.  Namor pulled over
 and asked Death where he was going.  Death shrugged his shoulders and asked
 where Namor was going.  "I'm going to die," answered Namor.  "Aren't we
 all?" replied Death, and they giggled like little schoolboys.  The sense
 of humour of Atlantis was terrible in those olden days, and that's why
 Namor was so prepared to kill himself by following the trail to a certain
 or an uncertain death.  He asked Death if he wanted a lift, but the hairy
 little guy was already passed out and in the process of soiling himself!

        Now that was a wonderful and unprecedented show of loyalty and
 respect that didn't become widespread in the City of Night until years
 later, but Namor had momentarily forgotten.  He wasn't in Atlantis anymore,
 he was in The Land of LaLaLa!

        The Land of LaLaLa was a magical world, too beautiful to describe
 in mere words and too vast to be calculated with numbers!  The only way
 knowledge of it could be passed on was through the brilliant sculptures of
 the period and the detailed battle tales as chronicled by the legendary
 scribes of Atlantis.

        That didn't count, though.  It just didn't count to Namor.  As he
 sped toward his end, the road pulled him faster and faster with increasing
 gravity.  He flew faster, and the finale drew closer.  Closer, closer, he
 could see the end now.  He flew through the finish line and like the
 snapping of a rubber band he was in another place.

        A bucket.  Namor was a bucket.  The felt the tough hand of the
 pretty young milkmaid grab his handle and carry him somewhere unknown.
 The way she clutched him and swung him by his handle was very attractive
 to him.  Then she sat him down in a pile of stuff (he could not determine
 what it was), and she filled him with the fresh milk of the cow.  "I love
 you," he thought to her, but being a milk pail he was unable to speak.  She
 loved him too, though.  She loved him just fine.  She took care of him,
 washing him every day, scrubbing him with her naked hands.  He served his
 purpose in serving her too.  He held all of the milk that she could not
 bear by herself.  Their relationship flourished, and Namor was happy for
 the first time in his new life.

        Then one day he got a hole in him, so the maid didn't love him
 anymore.  She threw him in the scrap yard to rust and decay until the end
 of time.

        You might be feeling a bit sorry for Namor, but he met a really
 nice shovel and they fell in love.  She had a broken handle, but he still
 loved her, and as they decayed together for the next several thousand years
 they were happy that they were not biodegradable and that they could love
 for nearly ever.

        Then one day someone cleaned up the yard and threw everything in
 another yard.  Namor never saw the shovel again.  You might be a bit sorry
 for him, but he decided that he didn't need love anyway and was happy just
 to be alive.  Then he realized that he wasn't alive and spent the rest of
 his existence in solitude.  After he decomposed there was another rubber
 band snap and he was back in Atlantis.  The only problem was that it was
 several thousand years later and the world was way too different.  He
 couldn't handle it so he killed himself.

        Some of the people of the day found Namor's body, and the way they
 got rid of dead bodies at this time was to teleport them to different time
 periods.  They transported Namor back to his own time, a week after the
 pink guys carried him off, and the Healers nursed him back to health.  Then
 he returned to the capital and told everyone of his amazing voyage.

        We didn't believe it, though.  We may be fictional, but we're not
 stupid.

 THE ATTENTION, THE CAR, AND ME by dinkee

        before i ever got my license, i knew nothing about cars.  i knew
 nothing about the horse power, the stick shift, the gear box, the
 coolant... absolutely nothing.  i found it utterly ridiculous too how a
 boy could fall so in love with a car and would rather spend hours waxing
 it, watering it and polishing it than doing those things to me.  for a long
 while, i thought, "okay, its YOU, it may well be that you give the
 appearance of someone who doesn't need all that smothering, unlike a car
 who constantly craves the human touch."  so i went on my utterly confused
 teenage years panting over a boy who had a car, trying all different ways
 for him to pay attention to ME than HER.  i thought, "maybe if i had better
 curves than her", "maybe if i smelt like leather".  and trust me on this
 one, there is nothing worse than having to don on tight leather pants in
 the middle of summer to impress a guy... and STILL no attention.

        so okay, that didn't work, since he loved to polish that thing, i'll
 make it look like i need a good polishing.  so off i went into a spree of
 grunge clothes, greasy hair, clothes that needed a good wash and the
 response was "you look tired and drained out, you should take a long bath
 and take a rest for a few days."  what to do i pondered?  mind you, this
 was when i was quite the young girl, impressing a guy was the main focus of
 the week.  if it wasn't the boy with the car, it was the boy with the
 skateboard, the boy with the guitar, the boy with the beer, the boy with
 biology books, etc, etc.  as years went by i got so fed up with impressing
 "the boy", i decided a rather "mature" approach, and to forget that boys
 ever existed in this world.

        i viewed men with a dangling thing as a distraction to the real
 meaning of life.  "poo to boys!"  i would say whenever a girlfriend would
 coo over mr-oh-so-damn-fit, why bother?  you'll just end up in this never
 ending "pay attention to me!  i can be your toy!" and will you ever get his
 attention?  no.  well, i say that with utter confidence only because i'm
 just incredibly lucky to have never gotten attention when i wanted it.
 but then it all depends on the individual as my mum puts it.  sometimes,
 some girls just go for the boys who are complete pricks, and boy are there
 many in the world.

        so time has passed, and i do have my license, and i polish my car,
 i wax it, water it... everything that "the boy" did, and it hit me.  it had
 nothing to do with the fact that i was not interesting enough, or that i
 didn't smell of leather, or any of that silly stuff.  it was the mere fact
 that "the boy" didn't have much to say to a girl who wanted to get to know
 him.  now that i'm much older to understand cars, i don't find it all too
 ridiculous to love your car so much to want to spend every energy and
 affection into it, because to be perfectly honest with you, if i could,
 i would shag my car every day and every night.

 OLD UNPUBLISHED ARTICLE INTENED FOR "RICUS" by Squinky

 Hey there, my name is Steve.
 
 I've got a pretty average life, I'm mid 30s, unmarried, heterosexual,
 have a dog, have my own apartment, and I'm an invalid.
 
 Yeah, I'm an invalid, so fuckin' what? If I could do something, I'd shove
 my cane right up your fuckin' ass. 
 
 Anyways, I'm not here to threaten you, but I'm hear to tell you about my
 great life. 
 
        In the beginning, my parents concieved me in a barn. You see, I'm a 
 first-generation human, evolved from cows. Yeah, I know what you are 
 thinking, cows? I thought humans evolved from Apes, well guess what, we 
 didn't. I'm living proof of this. Science *hAS* been wrong Before. Anyways, 
 the labor was very tramatic, and my Mom died. So, I never really knew her, 
 other than her insides. Of course, I was to young to understand what was 
 happening at the time, but good ol' Dad was not pleased with me at all. 
 Apparently, he didn't like me being the reason of his Mate's death. 

        I killed my mom. I admit it. Now, some might say "Actually your
 mom's animal desires killed her", which in effect is true, unless you
 really brake it down. If she still had sex, but just didn't get knocked up,
 she wouldn't be dead. So, Dad blamed me for Mom's death, and so Do/did I. 

        Dad didn't like the idea of having a first generation human in the
 family. Not one bit. I swear he tried to kill me on 30, or so, different 
 occasions. But hell, I still love the bastard. Why? I guess our blood link 
 must be it. After all, his reaction is understandable, if I had a damn
 freak for a son, I'd be the first to rip his head off.

        Damn, I hate freaks. I see them all the time, here in my little
 room of horrors. That is what I call my bedroom, because that is what it
 is. The government provides a nurse for me, but she only comes once a week,
 so by the time she is here, I'm in a pile of shit and piss. And TeleVision
 is my only real friend. Of course, I can't change the channel, but that's
 ok, cause I have my VCR preprogrammed to do it. Had the nurse do it, let
 her spend her time doing something useful, and let the shit pile up. Yeah,
 it piled the hell up that 2 weeks. Disgusting as hell, but who cares, I'm
 going to die soon anyways.

        TeleVision however, is really what keeps me alive. Sally Jessy
 Raphel, Phil Donahue, Oprah, Montel Williams, all of 'em, they're my best 
 friends in the entire fuckin' world. I just love they way they get all the 
 mutants, like me, on. I saw a lady with a Beard yesterday, and I thought to 
 myself, "Wow. I'm lucky". I actually fuckin' thought that. I'd rather be 
 dead, except for brain activity, and excreting, than be female and have a 
 beard.

        What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm not part of society, I'm not
 even fuckin' accepted by it, yet I follow its standards, its believes, its
 values. Why? God damned, I hate bearded ladies, though. 

        Talk shows are the only thing I watch though, I like Science
 Fiction, and I watch it almost all the time. I really like Dark Shadows,
 though.

        Why Dark Shadows? Probably because of the women. I have an
 attraction to woman who are probably 90 at the time of my viewing whatever
 I am watching. Like in old movies, I'm constantly finding myself enjoying
 the females more than the actual movie. 

        Maybe I like these women, because I feel they are close to death,
 like myself, and in this I find comfort. I mean, they are probably dead, or
 on their way out, at the time of the viewing, and I'm dead, except for
 brain activity, and waste disposal. Like those fuckin' bitches would pay
 me any attention, if I was truly dead, though.

        Bitches don't like me. Gee, I can't imagine why, maybe it's because
 they don't want to fuck a guy who can even talk, sits around in a pile of 
 shit, and watches TeleVision. I've had sex though, I wasn't always this
 way.  But, the Chicks don't like me, and won't. My Nurse is the only
 female who has even acknowledge my existance as person for quite sometime.
 It's usually, "Oh my gawd!  How can you live with having that thing for a
 son?" to my dad.  And of course, it dosen't help Dad's view of my
 existance. I wish dad would just get it over with, and kill me.

        I'd kill myself, if I could.

 SUN by aster

        flash-flash polka dots and rainy spots.  things are white and grey,
 except for the close tree, and the inside.  easy on the eyes until you
 reach the inside.  easy on the eyes until you get to something warm and
 hot and over heated with bright WARMTH.

        rotating WHITE socks making patterns in the sky, but it is WHITE,
 and the house next door is off-WHITE.  and the screen is WHITE and the
 paper is WHITE and the frosting and the walls and the bread machine with
 WHITE bread cooking inside.  below the WHITE, or the black, more
 distractions of red or blue or yellow appear, but only for the brief
 moment before you look up again.

        the end.

 Jamesy
 ------

 PezMonkey: "jamesy is gorgeous."
 MoonBagel:  "he really, really is."
 PezMonkey:  "yes."
 MoonBagel:  "he is the type of guy who, if I saw him in a public place, I
              would blatantly and conspicuously stare. and then if he
              noticed, my eyes would get really big, and I would fling my
              head in the other direction. hopefully not into traffic. and
              if it is an eating establishment, hopefully not onto someone
              else's food."
 PezMonkey:  "yes, i think you're right."
 MoonBagel:  "seeing Jamesy would result in me making weird guttaral noises."

 Mogel
 -----

 MoonBagel:  "mogel is astoundingly adorable.  I've said this before, but he
              is everything I wanted two years ago.  seeing Mogel would
              result in me giggling."
 PezMonkey:  "yes."

 Murmur
 ------

 MoonBagel:  "Seeing murmur would result in me saying, 'He's reasonably cute,
              but damn, he's weird.'"

 MoonBagel:  "Sure! This is fun. :)"

 <break>

 Styx

 MoonBagel:  "YES!"

 SkinHorse
 ---------

 MoonBagel:  "Rob is a Big Blond Aryan ;)"
 PezMonkey:  "He looks like he would break things.  But is he sexy?  That, I
              think, is the ultimate question."
 MoonBagel:  "He is sexy in the sense that I would dig him if I saw him play
              piano. and I would say I wanted to lick him until presented
              with the opportunity."

 Puck
 ----

 PezMonkey:  "Steev, I think, wins the most lickable award."
 MoonBagel:  "Yes.  I would lick him in a very few seconds."
 PezMonkey:  "The green hair makes me think of a smurf when I see him,
              though."
 MoonBagel:  "Smurfs are cute!"
 PezMonkey:  "And so is Steev!  But I think that if I watched him drink
              anything, it would come out of his piercings, just like a
              cartoon!"
 MoonBagel:  "He's a sprinkler! A sexy sprinkler."
 PezMonkey:  "With a cool hat."

 Sweeney Erect
 -------------

 PezMonkey:  "I think Ron pretends to be mean, and I would lick him, just
              because of that."
 MoonBagel:  "Ron is lickable in an "I don't want him to die, and he has
              great taste in men and socks" way. He's squishy-cheeks
              adorably sexy."
 PezMonkey:  "Awww..=)"

 Kraftwerk
 ---------

 MoonBagel:  "Art is cute in a "I want to smack him and kick him" sense."
 PezMonkey:  "I think he's too into this whole 'My Bitches' thing.  He
              worries me."
 MoonBagel:  "yes, he really is. and 'gay warez'"
 PezMonkey:  "He's gay."
 MoonBagel:  "Art is Gay Warez."

 Juke
 ----

 PezMonkey:  "I think juke is adorable.  I want to lick his nose."

 ---------

 PezMonkey:  "Trilobyte just looks weird.  He looks like a bug."
 MoonBagel:  "he looks like a 'nerd nostalgia' writer.  he looks like the
              academic squad from my school. :)"
 PezMonkey:  "heh, he's every generic high school academic bowl person all
              rolled into one.  he also looks kind of like that kid from
              Sixteen Candles."
 MoonBagel:  "Yes, he does!"

 Black Francis
 -------------

 MoonBagel:  "Frannie is skinny and hot."
 PezMonkey:  "He's hot in that 'I shot up too much smack today, want to
              fuck?' kind of way, sure."

 Creed
 -----

 MoonBagel:  "creed, however, is hot in a kind of gross sort of way."
 PezMonkey:  "hmm...creed looks like he wipes his snot on his sleeve."
 MoonBagel:  "yes, he does."
 PezMonkey:  "But he's kind of cute in that 'i'm a slob' kind of way."
 MoonBagel:  "yes, in a vaguely unattractive, but cute, way."

 JubJub
 ------

 PezMonkey:  "Jubjub looks like a gangsta' wannabe....or Tyler, Matt's
              friend.  But I suppose he looks better in orange than most
              people."

 "a frequent reply in the land of the tiny brained folk"
 by killthegirl or kate...ya know, whichever.

        she was this girl. this amazing girl. that girl that everyone
 knows and thinks is cool and wants to just be able to talk to. the girl
 you stare at in class but embarrassed if someone catches you because what
 if they think you are a lesbian or something. god forbid. something about
 her made you just want to watch how her mouth moves when she talks how she
 never takes notes during lectures how she manages to crack her knuckes
 gracefully. you were never sure if it was just you that was so enamored
 with this being or if she cast this spell over others. you wished you
 could be just like her. or she made you wish you were at such ease with
 yourself. and one day you complimented her on her hair or shirt or
 bracelet and she smiled and thanked you and you blushed. and someone must
 have seen your cherry red face and told someone else because pretty soon
 you were standing in the hallway with three people standing around you
 wanting to know what was up. and you were afraid if you tired to explain
 your fascination it would get all skewed and misunderstood. so you just
 stood there. and it got very surreal and like something you had read in a
 judy blume book when you were twelve. and you just really wanted to go home
 and reread the book so you could see what the character did that made
 everything back to normal and catch the hot older guy by the end of the
 two hundred pages. but you just say you dont know what the fuck they are
 talking about. and they roll their eyes. and you walk away.

        the end.

        yeah well, i just thought i'd submit something since i've read every
 goddamn text file at good ol hoe.

 Maybe It's Better That Way
 by Cap'n Sparky

 August, 2000:

        I finally managed to get up the needed courage tonight, and I
 called Meg.  Technically, it shouldn't be so difficult to call up and
 ex-coworker and ask for the number to the place we used to work, but of
 course, ex-coworker isn't her only "ex" designation. I would have had a
 job a few weeks ago, if it wasn't for the fact my old boss moved and Meg
 is the only person I know who would know the new number. The Yellow Pages
 don't have it. Even if they did, I suspect I would have called Meg anyway.
 For the life of me, I can't figure out why.

 December, 1999:

        Something had been bugging her during the whole conversation. When
 you've known somebody for close to six years, when you've worked with them,
 and been intimate with them for so long, it's painfully obvious when
 they're holding something back. I told her to spit it out. Some things are
 better left unsaid. The worry dropped from her voice, "I don't know how to
 tell you this... I mean, I don't want you to take this the wrong way...
 but I've been screwed up, you know, my dad, other guys... I don't trust...
 I mean, I don't trust people easily. With you, though, it was different.
 I learned how to trust people, and this guy I'm with... I'd marry him in
 a minute and... well, I wouldn't trust him as much if it wasn't for you.
 I mean, you were a very special person..." She went on for a little while
 longer. The gist was that my relationship with her had been a sort of
 primer. She had already told me, about two months before, that she felt we
 were too "different" to see each other ever again. More recently, she had
 told me she was seeing someone new.

        There was a long, extremely uncomfortable silence.

 November, 1999:

        "Look, Meg," I said, "I've always told you that I wouldn't be able
 to keep talking to you if this happened. I meant it then, and I mean it
 now. I just can't be friends with you. I've never made that a secret. As
 it stands, we're simply going to drift apart as friends anyway. I'll call
 you once every few months, and then maybe once a year, and then... The
 truth is that it'll be too painful for me to talk to you like this. I'll
 be, 'How are you?' 'I'm fine' 'How about you?' 'I'm pretty good'. I can't
 do that. Please don't ask me to."

        Her response?

        "Well, who knows, it could all be over in a month or two."

        The sad thing is, she didn't even know that she was being
 manipulative. It could all be over in a month or two, indeed. What the
 fuck? Was I supposed to sit by the table and beg for scraps? No thanks.
 Unfortunately, she didn't even know that that's what she was asking. She
 too used to getting her way. Her way, in this case, was to keep me on in
 an advisorial capacity. "Oh, boo hoo," she wanted to be able to say, "me
 and my new guy are having problems. What should I do?"

        I tend to observe people. I watch them. I keep quiet. In my life,
 I've observed enough people, and I have a good enough memory and a quick
 enough mind to make connections. In addition, I'm stubborn. I'm insistent
 enough that I'm not easily brushed off when I confront people with hard
 truths about themselves. In short, some people think that I give good
 advice. I don't know about that. In an age when everybody tells everyone
 else what they want to hear, nice little lies, I guess that becomes an
 asset.

        At least she thought so.

        Incidentally, that's how we broke up. I told her really harsh truths
 which she didn't want to hear. Even in my worst moments, I end up giving
 good advice.

 September, 1997:

        I yelled into the phone. I knew she hated it when anybody yelled. As
 a result, I never really yelled at her, I was always quiet when I was mad.
 But this time, I knew that it would hurt her, so I yelled.

        "You're always fucking thinking about yourself, goddammit! I
 fucking hope you meet somebody one day... someone exactly fucking like
 you... fucking SELFISH so you can see the type of shit that you fucking
 put people through.  Everything's got to be about you, it's fucking always
 about you, you can't fucking compromise. Well fuck you, fuck this shit.
 Goodbye."

        <click>

        I hung up on her.

        I rarely hang up on people, and I usually only do it when I'm really
 pissed. It's the best way to ensure that the other person won't get a word
 in. They sit there, in the silence, realizing that the responses they were
 formulating, no matter how persuasive, were all for naught. In this case, I
 didn't even give her the respect of defending herself.

        In a way, it was a beautiful feeling, knowing that I had simply
 struck her dumb with the motion of my finger. Godlike. It was refreshing,
 and although it was a little harsh, I felt it was entirely justified. It
 was all the truth, after all. She was selfish. Everything in our
 relationship really was about her. To tell the truth, she really was
 unable to compromise. She wanted people at her beck and call. She only
 had time for people if she wanted to have time for people.

        The truth is that I wanted to go out to dinner, or to a movie, or
 just go outside maybe once or twice a week. She preferred to watch VH1, or
 E!, or shitty true-story, made-for-TV-movies on Lifetime. She was incapable
 of seeing people as... well... people. She just wanted to get off work and
 watch TV.

        In a sense, it was about her inability to trust people. She wanted
 to be in control, so that she didn't have to trust. As long as she kept me
 coming back to her place, to her world, everything was easy and
 comfortable. She didn't have to work at trusting me. She didn't have to
 worry about me slipping away on her watch. She wouldn't have to get
 jealous if I looked at a cute waitress, or if we hung out with my friends
 and I talked to Juliana, Melissa or someone else.

        You see, her dad had walked out on her mom. It had cut her pretty
 deep, and it left a wide scar. As a result, she had a hard time trusting
 guys. Unfortunately, or maybe appropriately, she was attracted to the kind
 of guys who she couldn't have trusted even if she was capable of such a
 leap of faith. Of course, since she wasn't capable of trusting her
 boyfriends, she wasn't capable of loving them.

        She was the dictionary definition of the jealous type.

        As a result, she had a succession of guys walk into and out of her
 life.

        Then I came along.

        There were never two people who were more mismatched for each other.
 I was a working class kid from the intersection of Kensington, Fishtown
 and Port Richmond. She was the daughter of a CEO of a major company. I
 managed to glide through some of the best local schools because I was
 bright. She managed to glide through life because of her dad's money. I
 was angsty, cynical, and really fucking surly. All the time. I thrived on
 argument and conflict. She was mellow to the point of absurdity, everything
 was okay to her, at all times. Any outward display of anger or
 disappointment, and you could walk all over her.

        I was then, and still am, manipulative. Even so, there are depths to
 which I will not sink. If I care for somebody, I will be straight and
 honest with them. I will respect their decisions. Despite the fact that
 she caved when faced with loud conflict, I refused to manipulate her in
 such a fashion.

        For whatever it was worth, I guess I could be trusted. I did put up
 with her for a long time. Maybe I put up with her longer than I should
 have. I don't know.

        The only time I ever manipulated her was that last night we were
 still "together", when I yelled at her. I wanted to burn that bridge
 between us, and I did.

        What was worse was that my logic was twisted enough that I thought
 that it was for her good.

        I really did.

        Crazy. I know.

 Spring, 1997:

        The light outside filtered through the blinds. There were
 alternating portions of light and dark on her body, under the thin cover.
 I got a kick out of watching her sleep. I could watch her for hours. I
 could study every part of her body. If I tried that when she was awake,
 she would get nervous and self-conscious, despite the fact that I
 frequently told her how beautiful she was.

        I meant it, too. Her eyes, her lips, her hair, her tummy, the swell
 of her breasts, her legs, other parts. Physically, she was the most
 appealing woman I had ever met.

        I watched her as she slept. I watched her eyes. They darted back and
 forth under her eyelids like... bugs.

        I remembered a time when I was younger. I waged war on the bugs in
 my backyard. I used chemical weapons, in the form of No Frills bug spray,
 to kill legions of bugs. Ants, pillbugs, beetles. No hiding place in my
 yard was safe haven. When the chemicals cleared, I felt hollow. I had
 learned, in a very direct sense, about mortality. I also learned that the
 deaths I had caused were utterly pointless. I had thought that my killing
 spree would be fun, but it really wasn't. It was disgusting, and I felt
 dirty.

        Strangely, Meg had been the first, and only, person I ever told that
 story to. I had always felt that it was so stupid and petty that I never
 wanted to tell anyone about it.

        That caused me to remember the time my cousin and I had burned a
 grasshopper alive in an empty lot. Once I went home and told my parents
 what I had done, they were angry. Over the rest of the day, it slowly
 dawned on me that I had done something very, very wrong. Not only had I
 killed something, I had caused it to suffer beyond imagining. I learned
 about suffering that day in a direct and very real sense. The incredible
 suffering I had caused was for my own gratification. I simply wanted to
 see what would happen. I had thoughtlessly done something so cruel that I
 am genuinely ashamed to admit that I did it.

        Her eyelids were undulating like... caterpillars.

        I remembered a time, down the shore, my brother called me other to
 look at a magnificent, fat caterpillar. As I watched in wonder, he let go
 of a big flat rock he had propped up. For him, it was a perfect shot. The
 caterpillar was squished, and its innards flew forward landing on my lips
 and in my mouth. I realized what was in my mouth, the life of that
 caterpillar, and I realized that the taste was the taste of death.

        How many bugs have been murdered for the thoughtless, pointless
 self-gratification of children? Was I doing the same thing here, without
 realizing it?

        I kept watching her. She was breathing, quietly. She was vulnerable,
 not just because she was sleeping, but because she was in love with me. I
 mouthed the words, "I love you," and I suddenly felt hollow inside. I
 realized that she was alive. Really, really alive. She was dreaming. She
 was breathing. She had hopes, fears and secrets. She had feelings. I
 realized that it was possible that I might hurt her someday.

        Whenever she said that she loved me, I knew that she really meant
 it. I knew that she cared for me. That made her vulnerable. What if I was
 simply playing along? What if she loved me, and I didn't love her? One day
 I might meet someone who I would fall in love with. I would leave her
 behind, and I would hurt her, like I had hurt that caterpillar. I could
 cause her incredible pain.

        If I was going along with it, why? For the softness of her mouth
 when I kissed her? The pleasant, easy feeling that I would get when I
 would tell my friends I was going to my girlfriend's house?

        I slid out of bed. I kicked my jeans, jingling the change and keys
 in my pockets. I quickly stifled the sound. I lifted them slowly and
 quietly. I fumbled for my shoes and my socks in the darkness. I stood on
 the balls of my feet and tried to silently work my way toward the door. I
 whacked my shin against the corner of the matress, which shook her a bit
 and caused my jeans to jingle. Meg stirred. I held my breath.

        She continued to sleep. I snuck out. In her living room, I slid on
 my pants in the darkness. I put on my socks and my shoes. I walked to her
 kitchen table and settled on a chair like a bird or a gargoyle. I lit a
 cigarette and watched the smoke in the dim light from the window.

        I thought about leaving.

        I thought about getting up, going to the door, opening it, and
 walking to the train station. I could wait for a few hours, and then be on
 my way home.  I could call up work and quit. It would be as simple as that.
 Nobody would have to know. It would confuse Meg, I'm sure. She'd call to
 see what happened... I could avoid her.

        If I wasn't sure that I loved her, I wouldn't want to be with her.

        Eventually, I decided to think about it some more instead of
 leaving. Maybe I did love her. I went back to her bedroom, took off my
 shoes, socks and jeans and fell asleep.

        I did say "I love you," after that. Quite a few times, but not
 nearly as frequently as before. I wasn't always sure.

 September, 1997:

        After I hung the phone up, I realized I had made a huge mistake. I
 felt so hollow inside I wouldn't have been surprised if I crumbled and
 blew away.

        I had hurt her beyond comprehension.

        My plan, carefully crafted to make our parting as quick and complete
 as possible had backfired because at that point, I realized that I really
 did love her.

        I realized then that I had blown it.

 November, 1999:

        "I want to tell you all about this guy I met, he's so sweet to
 me..."

        "I don't want to hear about him, because I'll hate him, and he
 probably doesn't deserve that."

 December, 1999:

        She had just told me that I had taught her how to love.

        I briefly considered pointing out that she had taught me how to love
 as well. I didn't, and I don't think that it really would have been the
 right time.

        Instead, after a few moments of uncomfortable silence, I said, "To
 tell you the truth... um... I really don't know how to take that." That was
 the truth. I didn't know how to take that. In fact, it took a few weeks
 before I really got pissed off that she had told me that I had made her
 happy by allowing her to fall in love with this new guy. What the fuck?
 Why tell me? Did she even think about how incredibly cruel that comment
 would be?

        "Sure, you didn't get what you wanted, but I'm so happy you helped
 me get what I wanted!"

        After that, she tried to rope me into giving her advice about her
 relationship. I did, and then politely told her I never wanted to talk to
 her again.

        I called her up to bitch her out a few weeks later, to tell her how
 much she had hurt me. I walked around in a dazed state for weeks. I
 couldn't concentrate on anything. I got her answering machine. It took her
 a few months to call me back. When she did, we exchanged pleasantries. It
 was a brief conversation, an it was obvious we were both holding something
 back.

        I suspect that she wanted advice on her relationship, but I refused
 to talk about anything other than how our mutual friend, my old boss, was
 doing. I have too much respect for myself, and I refuse to be the advice
 guy anymore.

        We're no longer lovers, we're no longer friends, we're hardly
 acquaintances.

 August, 2000:

        Tonight, I got the answering machine. Meg's answering machine has
 always had pretty much the exact same message. It has always been a simple
 message.  I think she changed it once, but it was pretty much exactly the
 same.  The one thing that never changed about calling Meg was her boring,
 simple answering machine message.

        But... It was different this time. At first, it was a subtle
 difference, the volume of her voice... but then...

        When I was younger, I used to run around and play in this forested
 swamp down the shore. One year, instead of that forested swamp, there was
 a brand new house. I remember being extremely confused, and as a result,
 extremely pissed, in part because the place I used to play had been
 destroyed, but in part because familiar surroundings which I had known
 my whole life had changed.

        I felt the same kind of feeling. My heart sank. "You've reached Meg
 and Mike..."

        I wanted to hang up, but I knew she had caller ID. She would see my
 number there, and whether I left a message or not, she might call. I fought
 off a sudden panic attack, and left my message. I don't know whether I
 sounded calm and casual or in a state of utter panic.

        Whatever. I guess it really doesn't matter.

        Now, I get to wait for her to call back. When she calls back, I
 probably won't really talk to her. We'll most likely chat a bit, but we
 won't really say anything to each other. As I said, we're not even really
 friends. In a way, that's comforting.

        Still, the answering machine message hammered home a finality I
 hadn't really expected. I hadn't prepared for it, because Meg's answering
 machine message never changed. I had feared getting her, and having to go
 through the motions: talking while leaving so many things unsaid. For
 some reason, that takes a lot out of me.

        I never expected that I'd get a kick in the teeth from her answering
 machine.

        Oh well, now I get to wait for her to call back. I managed to track
 down my old boss' home number, so I don't even need to talk to Meg anymore.
 Maybe it's better that way.

 LEGEND OF THE BLINK TAG by Juliet

        The World Wide Web, or w3 (god damn soul sucking buzzwords/acronyms)
 as some call it, was invented by CERN in 1991.  HTML started out as
 HTML 1.0, it was pure and virgin back then. No crappy tables, no
 browser-proprietary junk.  Frames were something you hung on a wall,
 and JAVA still a concept.

        Mosaic was released by NCSA in 1993. At this time, the Internet was
 still just something geeks used. There were all types of geeks. One special
 type of geek who helped create the w3 was a physics geek. We shall call him
 The Physics Geek.  Everyone just figured to be a normal guy with a new
 idea, but they didn't know that he had been on a Vision-quest (TM).

        Oh yes, The Physics Geek had found a portal to a plane that had all
 the answers. On this plane, they informed him of "The Blink". "The Blink"
 was a very powerful, yet wonderful thing. It cures cancer, restores family
 values, and will help you save on your income tax.

        The Physics Geek knew he would be laughed at, and dis-credited if he
 revealed this information, but he couldn't just keep it to himself. He
 decided that he would slowly integrate "The Blink" into society, and what a
 better place to do it than a tiny intellecutual community. So thats what he
 did. He decided to create a switch for "The Blink" in his new mark-up
 language called Hyper Text Mark-up Language. It was an easy way to control
 "The Blink".

        Unfortunatly he misjudged the geek community. He forgot these were
 the people were book smart, yet some were very close-minded. They didn't
 even give "The Blink" a chance. They damned it. They ridiculed it. Then
 they banished it. By the time Mosaic was passe, and Netscape 1.21b (used
 colors, didn't eat memory, wasn't that bloated - yum!) was released, using
 "The Blink" was worse than declaring that the Windows 95 original alpha
 release was bug free. The Physics Geek was crushed, but then he became
 angry. He decided to punish the world by never revealing "The Blink's"
 powers. And to this very day, we are in a blink-free world, and we are
 all a little worse off for it.

 THE LADY BUG THAT LOST IT'S HEAD by LatinMan

	The clouds slowly moved to engulf the pale light of the full moon
 but only served to give it's light a bit more splender.  I laid there
 staring for what seemed like hours observing every single movement of
 each cloud hoping that the whole scene wouldn't stop.  If I looked closely
 it almost looked like waves washing over a greenish beach but this isn't
 the time for descriptions, no its a time for relaxation and observation.
 Someone just said something but I'm lost in the moon, with all its power
 to make the waves in the oceans and to give women a reason to be bitchy
 once a month.  I guess its proper that the word lunatic came from the Latin
 word luna, seems anyone could go crazy just watching it like I am.  I could
 sit here for hours with people yelling out my name beside me and I would
 still have this dazed look in my eyes that any "normal" person would
 consider crazed.  But I lose myself, its time to focus on other things.

	I turn my head slowly watching the walls in the room seem to move
 with the slow turn of my head and body.  I finally see what that Someone
 was asking me to look at, It's watching Fantasia.  What a wonderfull movie
 the people at Disney have put together.  They have taken the wonders of
 classical music and put it to absolutely fantastic animation.  Just look
 as each color flows into another, I can just here It make soft sounds like
 "Ooh" and "Ahh" as each scene flows into the one after.  I wonder if I
 open my mouth would I make those same sounds, my train of thought breaks as
 a the music gets louder and thousands of brooms burst into the scene.  Oh
 god, what the fuck are they going to do to Mickey.  It looks like some
 gigantic gang bang and poor gay Mickey is in the middle of it.  I think of
 screaming out, "MICKEY YOU A BLACK BROTHER, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE TYPE GAY,
 YOU STILL CAN PULL A GAK OUT ON THEM!," but I realize that would be kind of
 stupid since It will probably just stare at me like It always does
 wondering why the hell am I not quiet.  It seems as if it read my mind and
 starts staring at me intently.  I try to look at the TV noticing that
 theres a shitload of water on the screen and Mickey's riding some book but
 I feel It's eyes on me so I turn back.

	I'm not going to let It win this fight, I will stare just as hard
 back at him.  It shifts positions moving slightly making me realize how
 beautiful It is.  My hand goes out just to feel it, but my hand is quickly
 met with even larger movements than before.  I doubt Its very happy right
 now.  I'm not sure why It just hasn't left by now, but its now up to me to
 deal with.  I realize suddenly how It got here, what It is, and why the
 hell It got here...

               *                       *                       *

        It must have been about 3 hours ago when I first found It outside.
 It was caught in some fake webs I put up as decoration outside.  I was just
 playing with the webbing between my fingers and suddenly came upon Its
 little body.  I knew if I wanted to continue playing with the web I had to
 release this poor thing.  I grabbed It as best I could but there was no
 budging, I pulled a little harder and sudeenly RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP He was
 free.  I was happy that I had saved Him from the web but I soon realized
 that He wasn't fully intact.  I decapitated this poor thing.  I heard once
 that it was bad luck to kill one of them so I took Him into the house to
 see if He was ok.  Yes I knew that wondering after the fact was futile, but
 I was very happy to see that He had survived and His headless body was
 still trying to fly.

        Needless to say I was EXTREMELY happy to see Him and in some ways
 sorta weirded out about the whole thing.  How the fuck was this lil thing
 still alive and at that still trying to fly with all its might.  I looked
 at each of its wings and was pulled in by its vibrant colors.  I counted
 its spots and realized how old it was, christ this bastard was older than
 me.  I sat him beside me and popped Fantasia in just for the hell of it.

               *                       *                       *

        I guess that brings you up to date on my little friend.  He's cool
 I guess, doesn't say much or move much, but he's pretty cool I guess.
 Shit, I forgot there was people over my house.  I look over and see Chris
 and Jen both focused on their own lil things intently.  Jen staring at the
 Wonderful World of Disney and Chris seems to be enthralled by the Lava
 Lamp in the corner.  I scoot closer to the Lava Lamp to see how "special"
 it actually is and I immediately realized how "special" it was.  A big
 bubble of, whatever the fuck that is, formed in the bottom and slowly
 oozed its way up until it got to big at the top and broke off.  It did
 this over and over again, and damnit I could not get enough of it.  It
 almost looked like real lava so I decided to see if it was just as hot.  I
 grabbed the Lava Lamp and held it, it wasn't as hot as real lava but it
 was pretty damn hot.

	Chris suddenly said, "Dude don't hog the lava."

	I smiled and said, "Don't worry it wont waste, I wanted to feel it."

	"Let me hold it for a bit then," he said as he grabbed it out of
 my hand.

        I stared at it still flowing in his hand and wondered what the fuck
 was in it that made it look so cool.  Chris must have been reading my
 mind because he said, "Its made from wax and oil dude.  I had one and it
 broke in my basement, all the oil fell out and the wax kinda just plopped
 down.  It was fucking cool as..."

	I think my kitty Tanks just moved.  It was sitting on the table
 right on the corner now its suddenly...SHIT it moved again.  I slowly move
 a bit closer to it not sure what the fuck its going to do and put my hand
 on its tail.  I sigh as I hear him meow softly.  I guess it was just the
 shadows the T.V. made as it played Fantasia.  I look down and realize I
 have a fucking glowstick in my hand and think hard about how the hell it
 got there.  I stare at it a lil and the memory slowly floats back...

               *                       *                       *

        We were all smoking in the dining room wondering what to do next.
 As I held my cigarette I suddenly see from the corner of my eye that Chris
 swiped at it. I look over at the cigarette and then at him.  "Dude did you
 just try to grab my smoke?"

	He quickly asked, "What the fuck you talking about Rich?"

	"Dude, I could have sworn you just tried to grab it, I saw it from
 the corner of my eye."

	He laughed, "Hah YOU GOT IT MAN.  I can see it in your eyes, you
 got it."  He flicked his lighter in front of my eyes and the blinding
 flash made me blink a few times.

	"Why the fuck you do that?"  I said as I rubbed my eyes trying to
 get the flickering flame from my vision.

	"Lets go to the bedroom," Jen said suddenly.

	We went in out of boredom I guess and Jen decided to turn off the
 lights so we could see the kickass glow in the dark stickers that we have
 on our ceiling and walls.  Chris suddenly started flicking his lighter at
 me again but instead of shrinking away from it I noticed that it almost
 created a strobe effect and I told him to continue doing it.  I just
 "Ahhh" and "Whoa'ed" as his lil light show continued.  It seemed almost
 like a dance floor so I had the sudden urge to do a lil beat boxing.  I
 was suddenly taken back to the late 1980's back when I rode a cheese bus
 to school and got picked on because I was the palest latino kid anyone on
 the bus ever saw.  I remembered all of the moved they did, the phat ass
 beats they would create during their lil beat boxing matches.  I didn't
 think and just let out a rhthym that actually sounded good, so I started
 putting in scracthing sounds and a few "Fat Boys" signature laughs, it was
 the shit.  After about 5 minutes of it, my lips got tired and I decided to
 stop.

	Chris came out of no where and said, "Dude, we should get a
 glowstick, that would be fucking awesome right now."

	I thought to myself and realized that I saw one inside my
 girlfriend's roomate's draw the other day.  I ran over to her room and
 accidently knocked over her ashtray while looking for the glowstick.  I
 finally found it but was forced to pass it to Chris as I cleaned up.  Jen
 came in to help me while Chris just happily walked around with my fucking
 glow stick.

               *                       *                       *

	Anyways thats how I got the glowstick, I stole it back from Chris
 and just kept it in my hand.  I put it under Tank's paw as I sat back to
 watch a lil more Fantasia and I was already focused on Fantasia as I heard
 Tank's meow in the backround.  I took a sip of my orange juice and gave a
 lil sigh because it tasted sooooooo good.  I stretched my back a lil and
 laid back enjoying Aladdin and Jasmine sing, "A Whole New World."  I
 couldn't help but smile as I saw the Sun slowly creep its way across the
 sky because I knew it was gonna be a groovy ass day.

 A VANDAL'S REVENGE by Viggen

        Andrew was walking along the road one day, holding hands with his
 girlfriend.

        He was tired from selling ecstasy to 14 year olds the night before
 and in no mood to be fucked with.  As he was strolling along, a rugbyhead
 (the New Zealand version of a jock) leaned out the passenger side of a
 passing car and called him several nasty names.  The driver also made
 several nasty hand gestures at him.

        Andrew was quite annoyed at this and yelled stuff back but this
 did not fully appease his anger, though the events that followed soon
 after would.  The car turned about five houses after the occupants of the
 very expensive car had insulted Andrew.  Andrew didn't think much of this
 until he walked past the point where the car had turned.  You see, Andrew
 at first thought the car had turned into another street, but no!  When he
 looked down a driveway he saw the same car driving into a garage.

        Andrew experienced a sudden mood change upon seeing this.  You see,
 he now had the address of the driver of the silver car.  Later on in the
 month, the occupants of the house discovered several rather expensive
 calls on their phone bill.  Some of their mail went missing and two months
 after the incident, one of them found a large overdue amount on their
 credit card bill.  Andrew now has a 20 gigabyte hard drive.

 never actually doing anything just sitting until i didnt even need him to
 tell me what to do i mearly knew what he wanted and did that he couldnt
 complain cause i did it to make him happy and to save his precious time i
 did this until the point to where he did nothing at all all day all night
 nothing he was wondering that maube he should get rid of me he had
 forgotten how to do things he had forgotten how he felt about things he
 didnt know what to do except that if if it wasnt for meit wouldnt have

 THIS FILE WAS REALLY WRITTEN BY NYBAR by Trilobyte

        I picked up the phone and dialed a random number.  A bored-sounding
 receptionist asked who I wanted to talk to.  Making up a name, I said
 "John Dick" then giggled.  She said there was no John Dick there, and maybe
 I'd like to provide one 'cause I've gots a sexy voice..." and I said
 "Nahh.. too many bitches already.. umm.. whatabout Nate Cooper?" She said
 yeah, and put me on with him.  I said "Howzabout frosty, where do I find 
 frosty the elf."  He said "In the sinsearch.. umm.. get naked." Complying,
 I realized I was a goat from the waist down!!  So I peed goat style.
 Awwwww yeahh.  So anyway, I was deep dicking a bunch of gnomish land gnomes
 and there was a land mine in my belly button.  And then, the fifth
 revelation (after "Afghanastan Banana Stand"): I was an outy. I was going
 to kill my self but a bunch of french faggots with girly T-Rex arms
 started attacking me like girls..... so I devoured them.

 GREEN EYED LADY OF THE NIGHT by Teletype

        as we lay in your bed, kissing with a passion never known before,
 the vodka slowly inching its tendrils into our bodies, wearing away
 inhibitions and pride, intoxicating, i am enraptured. i lay next to you
 but i am not there. this is not real. my reality is far away, on a rickety
 apartment balcony overlooking a run down old school yard. i watch over the
 broken railing as young children, eager to fit the mold of society, play
 amongst broken bottles, and the long since extinguished butts of
 cigarettes previously enjoyed by the faculty. is this my reality? i watch
 with numbed emotion, failing to see the horror as the faces of the
 children melt and twist into forms incongruous with any human visage.
 the school building itself is crawling with hordes of maggots, eager to
 infest the minds and bodies of the pupils within. horror slowly sets in,
 and i turn away from this macabre scene, fleeing to the sanctuary of the
 apartment. inside, with a friend once again, i slide an old, well played
 compact disc into the player, press a button, and i am greeted with a
 flurry of music from the past, recorded by artists who have since died or
 gone insane. my friend stares into the television set, lost, as a worn out
 tape of twin peaks drones on and on about laura palmer. i ignore the
 television, and soon ignore the music itself, content to enjoy the surreal
 conglomeration of the several stimuli in the room. the odour of stale
 incense, cigarette smoke, and marijuana permeates the air. i drift into
 what seems to be a deep, refreshing sleep, only to later realise that i
 was actually in a sort of mindless trance. my reality shifts as i find
 myself back in your arms again. i want nothing more than to love you with
 all my heart. then, i realise of course, that this is only a fleeting
 reality. i let out an ephemerial sigh as i realise that i am driving.
 with a new found freedom, i speed down the interstate, the citisen's band
 transceiver fighting with the blaring stereo and the headlights of
 oncoming cars for my waning attention. behind me lies a past of crime, and
 hate, love and lust, dear friends, spiteful enemies, family,
 responsibility. all has been cast off as i hurtle toward my destiny. still,
 when i reach it, i find myself returning to you, to be in your arms again.
 are we real yet? i love you. i can't lose you. i hold you in my arms, as
 i see the final, desolate answer -- this will never be a reality.  i shed
 a single tear as i let you go for the last time, and seek the stability
 that comes when one is in touch with that which is real. i say a last
 goodbye, with a promise of return, to the friend with the balcony, visit
 my lonely hovel that i used to call home, milking it of anything useful
 that may still be there. i stop ever so briefly to feed lies to loved
 ones, and again, i set out on the road to my fate. good morning, dear. i
 hate you.

 This chart is about as exact as charts get.

 Well, not at all.  But, it does indicate in general how familiar you are
 with our clique, and how many times you can expect to be beaten
 personally by Satan when we all go to hell together.

 And if you are on the chart, and score differently than the score I have
 listed for you, then YOU TOOK THE TEST WRONG.  DO IT AGAIN.

 > Jill

        jill!

        i like your name, but i don't know why!

        here are three things i would like to have with me!

        1) i would like a fully e-commerce enabled desktop computer with a
 network operating system!  lately, i find the power and flexibility of the
 linux operating system to be both promising and rewarding!  i can "click"
 on the "pager" to switch "virtual desktops" so i can run applications like
 a web browser, an x terminal for email, and yet another web browser!
 perhaps i can also have a session of irc!  sometimes i like to talk to
 people!  i can perform e-commerce transactions at my leisure!  and since
 most e-business shops prefer visa, i'm all set with my $500 limit, $0
 annual fee, 14.9% introductory apr visa card from the fine folks at
 nextcard dot com!

        2) i would need to have with me a shopping center that includes such
 facilities as: a 24-hour grocery store!  a fast-food restaurant!  a post
 office!  a deli sandwich shop!  an ice cream shop!  a film-processing
 operation!  a store that sells cheap blue jeans!  lots of parking!
 obviosly, as i visit such establishments several times a week, i would
 need to continue doing this!  if you don't mind, throw in a radio shack
 or a circuit city too! this way, i can also watch a bit of television!  i
 watch tv for the great commercials!

        3) finally, i would require a red, convertible, fuel-efficient,
 cd-player-equipped, automatic-transmission sports car!  why do i want this,
 you ask!  because certainly whoever is going to supply me with these items
 of my dreams would never give me just the car!  they would give me an
 entire freeway system!  it would be the fastest road in the world!  only i
 would drive on it!  it would be immaculately maintained!  the yellow lines
 would be boldly yellow!  the white lines would be strikingly white!   the
 road would be one lane wide and not be one-way!  i could do a u-turn and
 still be in the same lane!  i wouldn't even have to flip anyone off!  no
 more danger from staring at oncoming headlights!  no more tricky lane
 changes or risky passing maneuvers!  no more getting pulled over by an
 aging, balding, overweight american citizen in a gas-guzzling television
 show on wheels!  the lane lines on this freeway would also be marked with
 evenly-spaced reflective bumps!  this makes driving at night easy, safe,
 and pleasurable!  the crosswalks would be wherever i wanted to park the
 car and walk across the pristine, black tar roadway!  the gas stations
 would be airborne refueling crafts, designed to fulfill my needs anywhere,
 at a moment's notice!  the roadway would be high in the sky and offer
 stunning views of the surrounding terrain!  perhaps there would be an
 extensive bridgeway out across the water!  of course, there would be
 hundreds and hundreds of garages along the way, so i could park my car
 anywhere i wanted to!  i would just stop driving, roll the baby into the
 nearest garage, and keep it out of the harmful effects of weather!

        please call me before you swing by to take me to the island!  i'll
 have to send a few email messages, and find someone to take care of my
 plants!

        dear tom!

        i'm sensing some kind of deeper meaning here than you are willing
 to share!  perhaps this is some kind of story about your fear of chocolate
 cake!  after all, it is proven that one out of every sixty seven thousand
 adult men are afraid of chocolate cake!  the most common method of
 self-treatment is repression!  by filling one's mind with other thoughts,
 chocolate cake is forced out of your mind!  is this what you are doing
 here!

        if not, tom, then for god's sake, consider taking long lunch breaks
 so you can pluck a few notes!  hell, i love music too!  music is not a
 crime! skateboarding -- now there's a crime!

        dear paul!

        i am very amused!  please have your friends email me!  i would like
 to discuss with them, for example, some of the methods i have devised for
 categorically storing and later recovering animal parts in the earth!  as
 you know, earth storage of animal remains is a very effective process that
 encourages rapid decomposition along with promoting regional plant growth!
 there's this whole food chain thing taking place, and frankly, i'm linked!
 so please, tell me more about your friends!  do they like vanilla cream
 soda!  do they enjoy "trance" music!  do they like exotic cocktails!  what
 books do they enjoy reading!  do they like outdoor adventures!  bike
 riding!  hiking!  road trips! an afternoon at the beach!  a picnic!  a
 stroll through the park!  a trip to the aquarium supply store!  

        you know!  one time, i was at this aquarium supply store with some
 friends!  i stared at this salt-water tank for a long time!  there were
 these two pretty large fish inside!  one of them kept swimming around and
 turning to stare at me!  and i just watched and watched and watched and
 watched in fascination!  it was a very surreal moment!  and then right
 about when i was going to leave -- now, you'll have to believe me on
 this -- the fish winked at me!

 > Bart

        dear bart!

        let me tell you a story!  this story is chock full of clyde fun!

        about three years ago, i started getting serious about fighting
 crime!  i sought out crime in all its forms, in hopes to eliminate it!  do
 you know what i found!

        lots and lots of crime!  everywhere!

        i went to the grocery store and stole some notebooks and pens!  i
 took careful notes of all the crimes i observed around me!  people boarding
 the bus without paying the fare!  random street people walking in to
 restaurants to use the bathrooms without buying anything!  people trying
 to sell stolen merchandise! successful attempts of automobile
 vandalization!  banner advertising on the web!  novels with no plot!
 toilets that don't flush!  rough toilet paper!  head cheese!  flammable
 bedding!  uneven sidewalks!  spoiled milk!  thin paper plates!  fatty
 snacks!  fatboy slim!  long waiting lines at nice restaurants!  overpaid
 slackers!  dirty pants!  buses that are thirty minutes late!  rice candy
 that tastes so good but lasts for only a few seconds!  grocery stores that
 close at night!  fake buddha statues!  my gay friend who is in love with
 savage garden!

        then, of course, with my notebooks full of carefully compiled cases
 of crime, i set out to eliminate these crimes!  i started to develop an
 anti-crime web site!  you can visit it too!  just go to
 www.clydecrimefighter.com with your internet web browser!

        crime fighting is never easy!  people always want to prevent me
 from doing my work!  some of them want to eliminate me!  but it is my hope
 that even if i am eliminated, my crime-fighting web site will live on!

        so, in conclusion, i think your downy ball is working just fine!
 the water levels inside the opened downy ball upon completion of your most
 excellent laundry procedures is merely a coincidence!  please do not be
 embarrassed to share stories like this one in the future!  we're all here
 to help you!  clean, soft, static-free, fresh-smelling clothes are never a
 crime!  enjoy the results of your most excellent work!

 Subject: My wasted summer
 
        For the past 5 months I've been stuck in small town fucking Iowa
 for one reason, and the reason sucks. I would like not to mention the
 reason however for this file to make sense you must all know the reason.
 the reason is this, I still care about people too much.

        One of my best friends is haveing a marital crisis. He's 22 years
 old, he's on his second marriage/divorce and there is a 18 month child
 involved in what might turn out to be a very messy custoduy battle. Now I
 haven't left yet because my friend has needed moral support from anybody
 and it seems the rest of our friends just kind of ditched out.

        For these past five months i've been doing almost nothing but
 getting drunk, going hungry and hanging out in nudy bars. Hell, one frisky
 night back in July one of my friends, Danny, decided to come up and visit
 Rick and I for a couple of days, well, lucky for us he had just gotten
 paid that day. i had been dropped off at my mother's house in Waterloo, IA
 to go to sleep.

        wait a sec. here's one for ya' my mother owns a house in Waterloo,
 after my parents had gotten a divorce and all the moeny was split up, my
 mother decided to go and buy a house in waterloo, however, she currently is
 borderline broke and is living in Chicago with some friends. My brothers
 were going to live in the house during the summer and pay the bills.
 Neither one of them ended up getting jobs or paying any bills. Instead
 they decided to sit in the basement with their friends and get high and
 drunk every night, waking up in the morning, going out and playing frisbee
 golf, then later getting high and drunk.

        right after the divorce my father and I went on a road trip to
 chicago and then on to detroit(ugly city that needs to be napalmed) during
 the trip my dad said to me, "Son, I need to find a woman with a bar and a
 jeep." Right now my dad is probably serving beer to middle aged men and
 women in the bar that his girlfriend owns.

        anyways, after I had just gotten to sleep not 4 hours later my
 brother somes knocking at my room door telling me to wake up. My friends
 had shown up and had decided to drive down to Des Moines to go to Big Earls
 Gold Mine, the only nudy bar within 100 miles that Dan could get into.
 Apparently at this "juice bar" if you got a private dance you weren't just
 getting a lap dance you were getting a hooker who worked cheap. Well, I
 only had a set amount of cash flow so I just sat back and got dollar dances
 all night. The radio was broke so on the ride home the three of us did our
 best to remember words to songs and did our damndest to sing the words
 that we could remember. All of this, on a doughnut.

        Did I forget to mention that during these last five months i've
 done more roleplaying than any human should be submitted to. Ad&d, Vampire,
 Aberant, WereWolf.....the list ends there unless you count Magic:The Crack
 Addiction in which case please shoot me for I have committed a sin against
 myself and against my faith that a card game, no matter what card game it
 is can and shall never be considered an RPG.

        Help me.....god someone, please help me, all of my dreams and hopes
 for the year have been flushed down the toilet, and none of my goals have
 yet been met, I have but one left, one goal that I still hold true to
 myself, and that is to be in New Orleans for new years eve 2001, i pray
 that at least this one simple task may be accomplished or forevermore i
 will be sorry that i didn't make it and probably grow up with some twisted
 mental disability that makes me eat hotdogs on friday.

        So basically this last 5 months has been wasted on nothing but
 alcohol and nudy bars. What a life.

 ASCII GENRE? by Phorce

        hi guys.  mogel tells me i should write something for the last HOE.
 i guess i'll try.  the problem is, i'm still stuck deciding whether or not
 i should use uppercase letters.  there was a while when no one used
 uppercase (god, DTO was so pretentious, don't you think?), and the effect
 was to lend an appearance of higher artistic worth to what you'd in any
 other context simply label "really crappy short stories by the excessively
 angsty."

        in any case, the rule was, use all lowercase EXCEPT when want to add
 extra stress to a word, or when you want to highten the contrast of an
 unexpected added clause to a sentence, YOU DIRTY BITCH.  you see how it
 works?  i'm not sure, but i think this style arose from a desire to "stick
 it to the man" and his traditional notions of uppercase.  you know?  FUCK 
 THE SYSTEM, MAN!#!#!#  AN4RCHY F0R3V3R!#!#$#!  sorry.

        i find the "ASCII zine style" very interesting; i feel it's rather 
 underrated and too easily dismissed by highbrow types.  it's more than
 just tYPiNG LiKe THiS -- you see, we were taking a cue from, uhm, the 
 style of modern poetry, especially that of e.e. cummings, the first 
 founder of an e-text "style" with his unconventional use of the 
 typewriter's idiosyncracies.  where cummings took the typewriter's 
 parentheses and other symbols and used them as an essential part of his 
 poetry's style, we e-zine kids have similarly taken ASCII -- which, like 
 the typewriter, was created not for stylistic reasons but rather as a tool
 to aid communication and construction of the written word -- and liberated
 it from its humdrum trappings into a form of high art!

    ||    you could even call e-zines a precursor to the
          world wide web and the "self-publishing revolution" 
          that futurists are always proclaiming will end 
          the publishing and recording industries.  right?

 --( stop!  stop already! )-----------------------------------------------

        sorry.  those two could go on arguing forever.  the point i think
 i'm trying to make is that although ASCII style and the first e-zines arose
 from the realm of the BBS and the "misunderstood, lone nerd teen"
 stereotype, it has come a long way since then and established itself as a
 real expressive medium.

        one of the best examples of this was the selection of several
 e-zines (including "y0lk" and Jonas) for display at an exhibit called
 "alt.youth.media" at the New Museum for Contemporary Art, New York City in
 fall 1996.  i attended the exhibit's opening as a writer for y0lk -- i was
 at the tender age of sixteen then -- and couldn't get over the way they
 triumphed the e-zine as a valid art form.  we were up to y0lk #99 then,
 and if you've read any of those issues, you'll probably understand my awe
 that *anyone* would consider that stuff museum-worthy.

        the rest of the e-zines in the exhibit were mostly webzines -- which
 brings us to the subject of the internet and the "world wide web."  you
 will agree that ASCII zines were not born of the era of hypertext and
 flashy graphics.  my era's e-zines were designed for viewing on a 80x25
 console screen: anything else still just doesn't look right to me.  
 viewing ASCII text files in a web browser is in my opinion the worst form
 of heresy, like selling "virtual museum" CD-ROM's featuring digitized,
 pixelated images of paintings -- you're not seeing the real detail, how
 the author intended it to look.

        [an aside: i've recently been working on a web frontend to an
 "ASCII to GIF" program and have been applying it to everyone's favorite
 e-zine, y0lk.  you'll see my attempts as a curator of sorts at
 www.y0lk.org.]

        but not like it matters anymore.  now, with the world wide web, you
 can lay out text and images unlike anyone in the old text BBS scene
 would've ever imagined -- in fact, our little ASCII 'toons would today
 simply become inlined images on a webpage!

                   xxxxx
                   |o.o|  -- you mean i'm OBSOLETE?
                    \O/
                    \|/

        yup.  sorry.

                   xxxxx
                   |o.o|  -- shit.
                    \-/
                    \|/

                  \  |  / 
                 - poof! -
                  /  |  \ 

        so that's the problem.  the era of ASCII zines seems to be drawing
 to a close.  and now, with this, the "last HOE" (though we've all heard
 that claim before in HOE #90), we come one step closer to the end.
 interest in ASCII zines now seems to be mostly nostalgic -- textfiles.com
 and etext.org serve as archives, not as publishing centers.  new ASCII
 zines are still being produced, but the "web" is slowly taking over --
 after all, ASCII e-zines have to be published via the web now (rather than
 BBS's, IRC transfers, or FTP), so it's no a great hurdle to convert them
 to pretty-looking web documents.  hell, even the cDc started formatting
 their textfile releases as webpages.  modern ASCII zines are quickly
 becoming what new ANSI art releases have become -- a "retro" nostalgic
 look back at the days of "old school."

        and that's too bad.  because i sure did like the ASCII zine style.
 there was always something very exciting about it to me; something about
 how each letter seemed trapped inside the console font's 8x16 pixel block,
 and how ASCII art and zine layout seemed to defeat that confinement and
 exploit those shapes for new purposes.

        and, although i was only involved in the "e-zine scene" for a
 relatively short period of time, i sometimes still wax nostalgic about
 those days -- of going on BBS's to download new zines, reading new posts
 on y0lknet and net-spiel; hanging out in #zines; starting "confs," giving
 out the konf infos, and talking to everyone until the guys from #hack got
 the inf0ez and started "toning" the conf; spending all day editing a new
 release of RAD, or packaging up new y0lks and publishing them; printing
 out copies of DTO or Jonas on so many pages of that dot-matrix paper with
 the holes on the side that i needed a new printer ribbon.

        goodbye, and thank you HOE.  and while i'm at it, goodbye and thank
 you, ASCII!  it was fun to read and write for ASCII zines when i was a
 teenager.  now i am doing new and different things and slightly older now.
 so bye!

        I felt I needed to express myself, but I didn't know to who.
 Well, since HOE has always been open to thought and expression, and since
 this is the last issue, I thought why not? Hey, by the way, like my
 ascii? Enjoy the lameness.

        I consider myself to be an active person in the hacker community.
 I have contributed to several magazines with articles of lameness. One
 thing I've learned, and anyone who has been in the scene for at least two
 years knows, the deeper you get into the scene, the more you find out you
 don't know shit.

        I joined the scene sometime in late '97 early '98. You know what I
 was doing for a long time? I was searching for the PERFECT TEXT FILE. What
 you ask? Yes, that's right, THE PERFECT TEXT FILE. Yeah, you see, I
 remember reading my first textfile, which was written by elite Legion of
 Doom member The Mentor: "A Novice's Guide to Hacking: 1989 Edition".
 1989? Well, I suppose I could learn something from this text. I tried to
 follow the methods in that file to attempt my first hack, but unfortunatly,
 the methods were too dated, and a little thing called the internet was now
 the prime source of hacking fun in this day and age.

        I searched for another 'Complete Guide to Hacking' text. No, I
 didn't want a text about blueboxing! No! I didn't want a text about Novell
 Netware! No! I didn't want a text about hacking webpages! I wanted the
 whole thing! The big enchalada! I wanted to be a hacker overnight! The
 first real step I took was war dialing my local prefix to look for
 interesting numbers. OK, I found some carriers! OK, now what?

        I couldn't do anything. Why? Cuz I didn't know shit! That's right!
 I opened the door myself to the world of hacking, and it was once I opened
 that door, I had a whole new set of doors to walk through.

        One thing that clearly became evident over the years in my quest for
 eleetness was the fact that if I was to excell in the hacker world, or be
 an expert in computers, I would have to learn UNIX. I had looked through
 PHUN, Phrack and cDc issues, and I see UNIX mentioned as far back as the
 mid-eighties. I saw the word UNIX everywhere. I didn't know what UNIX was,
 it was just another thing I thought I could never master.

        UNIX was everywhere. I tried to avoid UNIX becuase it seemed too
 complex for my understanding. So, I went looking for other stuff. IP
 Spoofing, hmm, that's an interesting idea, I'll try that. The article I
 read about IP spoffing mentions 'I expect you to know generally how TCP/IP
 and UNIX work'. Damn I thought! Can't IP spoof! Damn UNIX! OK, how about
 hacking webpages? Well, I needed to get the UNIX password file to do that,
 damn UNIX! OK, what about running some of these expoits I see here? Damn,
 it requires UNIX! arg!

        I turned to phones for a while giving up hacking entirely for the
 better part of a year. Phreaking was a cool hobby. I got to tinker with my
 home phones and do things with them, I would have previously thought
 impossible. I made free calls. Whoop de do! I got some voicemails. I
 scanned some more. Eventually I turned back to hacking.

        I finally broke down and got UNIX on my computer (Slackware Linux).
 I have since enjoyed it greatly over windows. Once I had UNIX, again, I
 was like, OK, What's next? I Don't know shit again!

        The point of this article, as I said before was, that the deeper
 you get, the more you find out that you don't know shit. But you should
 always keep active.  Currently, I am making my linux box into a shell and
 web server to see what it would be like administering something like that.

        Don't give up in the hacker world. It can be trying, but I think
 that in the end, you will be very well educated in the field of computers,
 and hopefully you will also have a whole bunch of 'undergound friends'.

        After time, you change your overall goals of hacking. Why did you
 become interested in hacking in the first place? Well, quite honestly, I
 wanted to rip off companies and get money in to my bank account all by
 hacking! Wouldn' that be cool!!

        Well, now I think that is not cool. I almost don't even want to
 'hack' anymore by anyones standards. I just like learning and administering
 my computer and how it works. I really am not interested anymore in taking
 over anyone else's computer. Unless, I fell like it of course :)

        I've had my ups and downs in the hacker world, and I after
 everything I've learned, I know that I am still ignorant of too much shit,
 and I don't know anything.

        But at least I try!

 DEAD PLASTIC DREAM by Cap'n Sparky

                  I

 Live jackal sky smoke expensive marijuana porking cooly bubblegum trellis

 The silly electric pig screamed upside down. The round kissing car barked
 too loud. The excited polka-dot boy barked at night. The round candy clown
 smiled very fast. The striped polka-dot girl screamed at once. The round
 invisible girl flew sideways. The tiny electric girl flew too loud.

                  IV

 The far useless soul broken
 The dead plastic dream
 All jumbled living careening
 Going to soul ruin
 Asphyxiate things after aimless careening life
 Fuck new embrace
 All thought broken
 Dead useless dream come inside
 Sweet godless choke

                  V

 color of eyes y eyes?

 way i wanted way she
 i wanted to wax she
 fuck up, fucked up, kissed, lips tongue

                  VI

        He sat at a train station, and thought about love, and about a woman
 he had just met. Half of half a billion dreams. "I am not the hand of God,
 merely his eyes." There's this key inside my head. Large buildings,
 brightly lit, futuristic-looking. New York. Dream concerned tornados,
 and a flood.

        The way she wished.

        Like a razorblade.

        Paranoid, careening. The skeleton is on a faded, padded bench next
 to the gate in the fence.  Infinite birthright. Middle of nowhere. Dead
 plastic dream. Knowing I'm loved gives me courage, knowing I'm hated gives
 me strength. Choose groups at random, read, and then record results in
 journal.  If you are an artist of any sort, your help would be appreciated
 as well. So what if I did, anyway?

        Words on paper in various forms, groups of words, possibly segments
 of text.

        The tail-end was still green. The excited candy boy flew upside
 down.  Optimistic. I unlocked it, it was so easy.

        Dead plastic dream. He says, "I am Magnum Iron!" I want to be
 perfect, ebony, marble, smooth, timeworn. Forgotten feelings erupt. All
 the times I wished I'd died. Universe into void. Here it comes again.

        I want you to see me. In the middle of nowhere. However, the lawyer
 will show up at his normal lunch-hour and curse, because the restaurant is
 closed. He will end up with chinese food. I heard you laugh today. I can
 turn the fresh air stale.

        It is a sawtooth-soundwave. Your madness seethes within me. I point
 at him and scream, "YOU!", he turns to run and bumps into a black security
 guard.  His wife will be overcome with grief and attempt suicide three
 times, finally succeeding on the fourth. One into zero. I ran into a
 playful solifugid (or at least that's what I called it). The giant kissing
 car smiled upside down. He got to the corner and three young teenagers
 robbed him, and then killed him.

        The trolley tracks are where they found him. Lexington Avenue.
 Tight.

        Also in this same room, in some sort of alcove, there were two
 preying mantises.

        You turn the lead into gold. New York, NY.

                  VII

        Between the Devil, Tetris, and a Little Girl.

        Make people you like into glamorous supermen, people that go against
 you into vicious subhumans. Who could picture "Alice in Wonderland" as a
 compressed string of ones and zeroes, "theres" and "not theres"? So, how's
 the black-leath bitch of life been treating you?

        "We ought never to do wrong when people are looking." - Mark Twain

 Notes:

        Section I contains the answers from a single "Mad Libs" game played
 by myself and a good friend, in delirious wee hours of the morning, back in
 1994 or so. Section II contains single answers from several "Mad Libs" games
 from the same night, selected at random.

        The sentences in Section III were spit out by a children's toy,
 designed by Tomy (I think). The toy contained several plastic tiles with
 words on them.  When flipped upside down, the tiles would form sentences.

        The poem in Section IV is made up of words, selected at random, from
 my journal. The year of composition was perhaps 1995 or 1996. The fragment
 in Section V comes from a page of dense text which I cut into strips and
 tossed back together.

        For section VI, I selected sentences at random from the journal I
 kept between about 1994 and 1996 or so. I ended a paragraph whenever my
 finger fell on a blank area on a page. The sentences in Section VII come
 from a journal I kept back when I was a junior in high school.

        The title was selected randomly from the text of this t-file. It's
 strangely appropriate, given the fact that the phrase "Dead Plastic Dream"
 appears three times in the body of the text.

 FINAL THOUGHTS by Quarex

        So, it is all over.  Sure, I should say "about fucking time," but
 I have no desire whatsoever to do that.  I fucking love H0E, and I always
 will.  I fucking love the fact that Mogel kept something going for so long
 that kept me in the habit of writing for fun.  I honestly think I owe at
 least some small part of my success as a writer (even if just at a
 college-classroom level. . . SO FAR) to this fucking ludicrous little
 e-zine.  Hell, H0E and the resulting "scene" that collected around it over
 the years introduced me to a lot of fucking awesome people, and helped me
 get to know others a lot better.  Mogel, Tasha, PezMonkey, Miasma, Caitlin,
 Drooplug, AnonGirl, Hardkore, Anjee, Thexter, Trilobyte, Styx, Art,
 CannibalButterfly, Six, AIDS, Phairgirl, the list can just keep going.  I
 even got to meet most of them in person!  H0E even in a roundabout way
 aided me in meeting my first girlfriend, and one of the best friends I
 have ever had, Soybean.  I refuse to discount the end of this zine as
 something completely stupid and meaningless, and disregard everyone
 involved in its long history, just because I am supposed to have thought
 the entire thing was stupid.

        Every single piece of fan mail I got for my writings made my
 fucking day for weeks on end.  I have to thank Avenger, Cap'n Sparky,
 Dan Nagy, Pat Cosgrove, Larry LaCost Jr., and everybody else lost in the
 mists of time who ever wrote me with kind words about my writings.  For
 them, and for everyone else involved with H0E who has ever told me I had
 some shred of talent, I simply must say "Thank you."

        In possibly the most appropriate ending imaginable to this text, I
 will now relay exactly what happened to me as I sat in my Descriptive
 English Grammar class, hastily scrawling out this GOODBYE.  I briefly
 glanced over to the two gorgeous girls near me, and one of them had
 written the word "hoe" on a sheet of paper and handed it to the other.
 While I guarantee there is no way they were referring to anything they
 saw me writing, I believe it suffices to say that the spirit of H0E has
 been transferred to the unwitting minds of all those around me, and shall
 live forever.

        So, that is about it.  Fuck off, and die.  The End.

 THE DEATH OF TPP by TPP

        Why am I bothering to even write this?  It doesn't seem like this
 final issue of HOE will ever be released, and if it is, no one will bother
 reading through a meg of this shit.  Fuck it..

        For me, the death of HoE represents the end of an era.  The final
 remnant of the old hax0r scene I was a part of has finally cashed its
 check.  Before any of you newbies say anything about ezines and hacking,
 you have to realize that before the web came around, the two scenes were
 inseparable.  Textfiles were to hacking as ansi was to warez... But if you
 were questioning me, you probably have no idea what ansi is anyway.

        Everyone else is gone.  I originally left years ago, but that foul
 year of the bastard 1999 brought me back.  When my life fell apart and all
 the blood started gushing out of the countless, open wounds in my back, I
 returned to this scene because it was the only other world I knew.  What
 happened during that 365 day shitrain is unimportant.  No one hangs around
 this long unless they have personal demons.

        I have wasted too much of my life over shit that belongs in the
 past and is better off forgotten.  It is time to throw out the bottle,
 get the fuck off IRC and put my life back together.  As HoE dies, so dies
 TPP. forever.

        Mogel, J arett, Kreid... Perhaps some day we'll get together and
 make a movie..

        And to all those fools on IRC that didn't understand the
 occasional drunken parody of myself, fuck off...

    You know, HOE can never truly die so long as IRC dorks wait for hours
 on end, desperately hoping for a flash of Metalchick's underwear...

                      We won't get into the lead cups.

    When I watch the learning channel sometimes I get real sad.  You know,
    that show had so much potential back when they were doin' the good ol'
    "SAFE" thing with animals.  Not that that gets the ratings, of course,
    but every now and then some druggie kid would tell me they watched that
    thing and it brought a tear to my eye.

    Remember before you got a job and started sucking?

    Now they've got these UFO specials on there and you can *hear* the
    awkward silences of pure irony and distain in their voices.  Betcha
    those guys remember the good ol' days.  A few years ago.

    I think the good ol' days are actually only worth lamenting if you're
    using it to fuel something new.  In case you're on the same page here,
    text files are the same way.  Use the style to evolve, or get lost.

    My grandpa used to say THESE TEXT FILES TODAY UGHHAA I CAN'T READ 'EM
    YA KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THESE 'ZINE WRITERS AIN'T GOT NO
    SENSE OF HISTORY IT'S LIKE, YOU SAY "CDC" TO THEM AND THEY'RE LIKE
    "WHO?" AND I'M LIKE "CDC ARE LEGENDS!!!" IT'S JUST FAST FOOD AND
    QUINTINA TARANTINO TO THEM but he's wrong.  All you need is HOE.

    That's right.  Re-read our entire archive of 1,111 text files.
    They're a part our history, preserved, in all it's insanity and
    embarassing glory.  Each word, ESPECIALLY in this final issue has
    some clever little irony and meaning behind it.  IF YOU DON'T GET IT,
    READ IT AGAIN.  IT'S ALL IN HERE LIKE SOME MYSTERY PUZZLE JUST WAITING
    FOR YOU TO DISCOVER ALL IT'S INTRICATE PARTS WOVEN TOGETHER LIKE
    A FANTASTIC ASCII TAPESTRY.

    And if any of you assholes try to start this thing up again, I'll
    kill you with my bare hands.
