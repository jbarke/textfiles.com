	Editor's Note:  It came to my attention after publishing this
 article that it's a rather popular e-mail forward that's been on the net
 for quite some time.  People know better than to forward me stupid
 bullshit like this (they send stupid bullshit to me as HOE submissions,
 not forwards), so I had no idea.  At any rate, I apologize to whomever
 might be the original author for having such a lameass idiot like
 Holocost submit this.

        I like monkeys.  The pet store was selling them for five cents
 a piece.  I thought that odd since they were normally a couple
 thousand.  I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I bought
 200.  I like monkeys.  I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.
 I let one drive.  His name was Sigmund.  He was retarded.  In fact,
 none of them were really bright.  They kept punching themselves in
 their genitals.  I laughed.  Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped
 laughing.

        I herded them into my room.  They didn't adapt very well to
 their new environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the
 couch at high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at
 first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.

        Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so
 inexpensive: they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sorta'
 dropped dead.  Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five
 hours later.  Damn cheap monkeys.

        I didn't know what to do.  There were 200 dead monkeys lying all
 over my room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  It
 looked like I had 200 throw rugs.

        I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work.  It got
 stuck.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.

        I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That
 worked for a while, that is until they began to decompose.  It started
 to smell real bad.

        I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I
 didn't want to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.

        I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.
 Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so
 I had to change them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food
 in the freezer so it didn't all go bad.

        I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.
 I had to extinguish the fire.

        Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen
 monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my
 bed.  The odor wasn't improving.

        I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and
 to use the bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.

        I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said that the
 city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that
 I had a wet one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother
 asking about the frozen ones.

        I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas
 gifts.  My friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that
 they like them, but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I
 punched them in the genitals.

        I like monkeys.
