                       LORD iNCARNADINE Presents:


                  -- TSR's And Other Assorted Bullshit --



          Ok. This is an article on TSR, that is Terminate and
    Stay Resident, programs and how to manipulate them with Turbo
    Pascal. I know a number of people who have been interested in
    this subject but lacked the programming skill to research it,
    so I will attempt to fully explain, without excessive use of
    technical shit, the practical side of this type of thing. So
    let's start at the beginning:


 o What is a TSR?


         Well, a TSR is a program that does not finish
    functioning when the end of the code is reached. It
    incorporates itself into RAM and 'Stays Resident'. In other
    words: You go back to the dos prompt, but the program is
    still running. A good example of a commercial TSR is the
    SideKick program.
         There are two types of TSR's: Passive TSR's and Active
    TSR's. Passive TSR's are run only when called by another
    program and are for the most part boring, but useful.  Active
    TSR's are TSR's that are called by a keystroke or that are
    constantly running. These are the ones that can produce the
    good stuff. The most common method in TP is to slave them to
    either the keyboard or timer interrupts.  Slaving them to the
    keyboard interrupt is a bit complicated and therefore will be
    saved for a later publication. The remainder of this issue,
    and all of the examples will focus on Active TSR's slaved to
    the Timer Interrupt.


 o What the hell is the 'Timer Interrupt', and what does it
   have to do with this TSR shit?


         Ok. Before going any further let's discuss interrupts
    for a bit. Those of you who are already familiar with the
    interrupt vector table can skip over this section. As for the
    rest...a little background knowledge is in order.
         An interrupt is a break in the normal system operation.
    Like your computer getting a telephone call. It stops
    whatever it's doing, deals with the interrupt and then
    returns to the program. Now there's a bunch of these things,
    both hardware (System Clock Tick[$1C], Keyboard[$09]) and
    software (Anything called by an INTR or MSDOS statement). The
    numbers represent positions on the Interrupt Vector Table.
    This is basically a collection of the addresses of interrupt
    routines for when they are called. Trust me, that did make
    sense. Lemme give an example:

         ( We'll follow the clock tick interrupt since that's the
    one we'll be using ). About 18 times a second the computer is
    informed its it's time to increment the ticker on the
    internal clock. So... 1st) It goes to the interrupt vector
    table and looks for the address of the increment routine at
    $08. 2nd) It then goes to that address and increments the
    clock.  3rd) Then from inside that routine it calls another
    interrupt ($1C) which simply returns the routine. 4th) The
    routine at the address found at $08 is finished, so it
    returns control to the program again.
         Now suppose, that we could change one of the addresses
    of the Interrupt Vector Table, so that it pointed to a
    routine of your making. Lets take $1C as an example: It does
    essentially nothing, so merely change the address at $1C on
    the table to the location of your own routine and now the
    computer calls that routine 18 times a second. No matter
    what. Whether something else is running or not. Sounds fun,
    eh?
         While a little simplified, that is the basis for the
    idea of TSR's, at least the ones discussed in this file.
    Now, on to the real thing.


 o How do I get TSR's to work in Turbo Pascal?


         Time to get to the point. What follows is a step by step
    to a working TSR in TP using the timer interrupt:


1) Choose the interrupt - for the purpose of this example
   we'll use $1C (clock tick).

2)  Write the routine, and make sure it works. There are a
    few rules here: The routine must be labeled interrupt
    in the procedure statement and the Flags have to be
    declared. You can't call any interrupts from inside the
    routine and you can't use any functions like WRITELN,
    READLN, or GOTOXY.  These will lock the program because
    they call bios routines and dos functions that won't
    work with the program suspended in memory.  Mathematical
    calculations loops and just about everything else is
    allowed. Here is an example of a method for writing to
    the screen, it accesses the video memory directly.
    Videoseg is a constant set a $B800. --



procedure shitonastick (Flags, cs, ip, ax, bx, cx, dx, si, di, ds, es, bp : word );
interrupt;

begin

inc(x);

if x = 120 then begin  {Number of timer ticks till execution}

            for bob := 0 to 17 do begin
            mem [videoSeg : ron + (bob*2)] := ord(word1[bob]);
            end;

       if ron > 3800 then ron := 60;
       Ron:= ron + 108;
       x := 0;
       end;

end;
       {This is the array it refers to.}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

word1[0]:='F'; word1[1]:= 'O' ; word1[2]:= 'U' ; word1[3] := 'R';
word1[4]:= ' '; word1[13]:=' '; word1[5]:='F'; word1[6]:= 'I' ; word1[7]:= 'E' ; word1[8] := 'N';
word1[9]:='D'; word1[10]:= 'I' ; word1[11]:= 'S' ; word1[12] := 'H';
word1[14]:='G'; word1[15]:= 'U' ; word1[16]:= 'Y' ; word1[17] := 'Z';

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       {The array is declared globally in another part of the program.}

         There are many other guidelines and precautions, but if you
    stick to the bare bones coding you should be ok. I seriously
    suggest buying a book if you intend to do this more than once
    or twice. The above will print a 17 character message on the
    screen by writing directly to video memory. The location of
    the message is changed by the variable ron, and is reset to
    0 when it is about to leave the screen. That example is about
    as simple as it gets, and adding the frills is easy
    enough - for instance sound works well. There are a lot of other
    things I could add, but it would take way too long. And, in any case,
    if your serious about it - get a book. Enough Said.


         3) Set up your keep statement and fix the memory. I won't
    go in to all that much detail on this one just use the following
    as the way to set up the timer interrupt:


                begin
                                                                                               0
                   setintvec( $1C, @{NAME Of YOUR PROCEDURE HERE});

                   keep (0);

                end.

            As for the memory. Use the $M compiler directive. And
    remember - the bigger the program, the more memory it needs.
    Take a look at the whole thing and notice the memory directive
    and variable declarations, specifically the array. --

Well, that was some Assorted Bullshit from Lord Incarnadine.... {Praise Jesus}

DAMMiT News:
Well, since our last issue, DAMMiT has changed a teensy bit. We have another
site, Dark Sun, and 2 new authors, Inky and The Pyschotic Pyrotic... so happy
fun to us.... This time we will NOT end with a quote, or a Joke, why?
Becuz. Well, look for some nifty new filez soon, including Issue 8, which 
should be out.... in about 20 minutes. Heh. If you've noticed, most of the 
issues have been by me... That should change soon. We have a buncha ideas 
that shall appear soon... mayhaps issue 9. Mayhaps. Lemme lone.

(History of this file: I called up Seven Seconds to check in, and found this
file as "DAMMiT #7".... I was told that Inky was making an issue, but, it 
kinda showed up, so... Hey, I doan care. If it's written, it's here.}
<{[Why am I wasting time?]}>
WAITER!

If you'd like the Newest, Spiffiest DAMMiT Filez, or wanna Join DAMMiT, or
would like your BBS to be a site, or just want to call a nifty board, or
want your toenails polished, call these BBSes:
