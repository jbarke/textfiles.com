Wowserz, we're back with issue 209 of CdCI..

Issue 207 and 208 went along quite well. I still have people asking me for
them everyday. In this issue we are going to wipe the dust off of a few
CdC pranks from a long time ago.
Death Dealer (covered in issues 180-200 approximately) is back. We are going
to give background on the deathdlr prank and show you new developments.

We are also going to show you more of jsz's reactions to the previous two
issues and more of this "jsz vs CdCI" lawsuit this Israeli is threatening us
with.

More info on Netta! The past couple issues were focused on her -- we are
shying away from that but are still going to throw in a little update on
grayarea in upcoming issues.

Phrack -- a console zine? Read and find out.

<***> jsz' hairy butty hole is mine first, that pussy
<jsz> here is another luser: invalid

To add to the jsz story, here's more scandal!

First off, grayarea at netaxs and invalid (who people think compiles these
issues!!@#!@#) at bud.indirect.com got hacked. Everything grayarea did was
monitored and all the positive grayarea email that invalid got was deleted
(good thing he kept backups -- only one week's worth of mail we lost).

To add to this, jsz, len rose and loki took over #hack and +i'd it -- making
it impossible for anyone to join #hack without their approval. This is total
bullshit -- isn't there supposed to be some kind of electronic freedom of
speach? Or are we gonna get banned for saying what we want to and standing
up for what we believe in..

The CdC lamer list comprises of:
len / terminus
jsz
loki

There are a lot more but these three top it. They sit on irc idle all day
because they don't want grayarea (and ILF i assume) to get into #hack and
destroy the world...

FUCK JSZ! FUCK LEN!

Well, if this rumor will be confirmed, I will call up Interpol Computer
Crime agent here, in Tel Aviv, Israel, and will tell them who the real
"WELL" hackers are. I am pretty much bothered with all those frame-ups.

I am no longer interested to hear about frame-ups, I have been framed up
for a couple of times already, and it disturbs me great deal that Len and
I are being accused yet again -- this is not fair, and if I have to find
those who framed us up, and punish them, I will do my best as I can.

Subject: Re: CSP

it sounds like u have not even seen the thing in question. if so, ask me to
dcc it to u. I was asked a question in an interview in Cult of the Dead Cat
about the WELL crackers identity (as my mag interviewed two of them last issue).
I answered as best as I could which is to not reveal the identities of the
two ppl whome we guaranteed anonymity and immunity to. The interview also
reveals that I was informally and briefly questioned by the FBI regarding
their identities.

Really, I think u were picked as an example because everyone who sees CDC
would know it was not u and len. But I think writing a letter to the editor
of CDC, Invalid Media, is your best shot for venting your feelings here.


But, I didn't choose to bring up your names, they did. And when one is
interviewed, one must answer what they are asked and alas in this case I
am unable for legal reasons to say who and we did or did not interview. :(
Len has the issue in question of Gray Areas and I think if u were to read
even a few questions of it to either interviewee you would see that it is
unlikely anyone who has ever spoken to either of u would confuse u with
them.

See u on irc....And if it makes u feel any better, one other person has had a         voiced his disapproval
of my interview. One of the 4 ppl who use the Spyace acct at MindVOX has
been claiming I was never contacted by law enforcement and am making it all
up. This same perosn also harasses ERIKB and Emmanuel so it seems to be
anger/jealousy directed at publishers. I am *not* trivializing your concern
here. Just sharing.... another story.

Can't these people take a joke? I doubt it.. the whole thing should have been

<Jason_> <grayarea> Well, thanks for holding off the question this long! It is
<Jason_> question I am asked most often on #hack. I can't tell. As I told the FBI,
<Jason_> I promised them anonymity and immunity and I mean that even if cited
<Jason_> contempt in court. I didn't tell the hacker I dated who they were and
<Jason_> I can't tell you either. In fact, one of them does not know who the other
<Jason_> is and as much as he deserves to know, I haven't been able to tell
him either.

----------Article 2----------------------------------------------------------
PART I - Background on deathdlr
Here's a little background on the whole Death Dealer (deathdlr) scandal. In
short, he was a local 602 bbs lamer who was being a complete prick and always
ragging on the CdC gang and UPT. What we did was become real dicks and get
our legit accounts deleted off his board and them start begging for access
back so that he thought we really wanted to get on. Meanwhile, we were set-
ting up fake accounts as leet MOD members on his system. These accounts were
shock (Corrupt), renegade, The Executive (Oryan Quest), and a few more. Not
all these accounts were MOD -- some were just people who we decided would
look keen as MOD members. He validated these accounts with FULL access. Mean-
while we were still acting like we wanted our legit accounts back! Within
a few weeks, his board became littered with posts about fake busts, fake
operating systems and shit like that. He had message bases set up so that
we could exchange more leet info on "Split-Screen LMOS 9.4 for DOS" and other
'leet things we made up. We then convinced him that us old MOD members ran
a board off of X.25 called Deep South that required SHITLOADS (many many many
megabytes) of encrypted term software to login. He bought it all. His board
then went down the day we released the full gag files on the internet (issues
184 thru 202 to be exact) so we thought he caught on. He didn't.. here's what
happened today when I logged into my indirect.com account...

[note: gatsby is referred to as a narq in this email message to me. This is
NOT true at all -- it was all bullshit. gatsby never isn't, never was and

NIce fake x-file you wrote.  If it was real then it was named falsly at
some frigging ftp site.  I took my system down after corrupt/mod (shock)
told me it was being monitored the out dial that is via transec at
beer.com netcom.com and eff.org.  Both of our bords had nce little
wild cards sewt to triggure the fucking cvapture.
About 9 days after I took my system down I c   got called
by many people asking me questions about lane and donnie.
The broadway hacker was also busted, he moved to az a while back.

I am calling from a fucked up vax which does not allow outgoing mail
so I am doing this on id's port 25.  Try and mail me back at

it might just work.  Hmm

The internet outdial is being monitored through ports at beer.com, netsys.com

outdials to 602 log whenever they see references to a bbs or see certain user

references to UPT, TSOS, SSOS, Unp*, Ser*, Se* because they are most likely

Build a "gold box" or actually build 3. It is a device that will pick up a
phoneline when it detects a ring on another, and give you a dialtone. I have
plans somewhere, maybe theyre online here, i dont know. Hook it up to the
cocot lines, and call one and dialout from the other. ;)
Or, stick 2 back to back, you have a loop. Until they find it. ANY way you do
it it wont last forever, whenever someone calls they get a dialtoe. ost
cocots have 300bps dialups ( :) ) and when they call in to check how much $$
is inside, they will go to see why the fone is acting weird. Its best to move
your goldboxes around anyway (actually install it, leave it, and install
others elsewhere when 1 dies)
not a bad way to make trace free calls.
Also, if you can hack the 300bps cocot dialup and check to see how much $$ is
in it, you'll know when to go steal the phone for an extra few hundred $$ in
quarters (for the laundry machine of course, or for ms. pacman!)

There are still loops around, unmuted ones, if you look hard...in fact, some
are "programmable", in that you need to enter a PIN to break the MUTE tone...
these pins are usually 4 digits long, but change monthly. They are mostluy
used by Field techs for maintenance, though many use them for free LD too. So
should we. :) Im calling through one right now, in fact, because they are
more than loops these days (thanks to digital switches!) you can outdial with
them, or link them to make bridges. They are like mini PBXs in the phone
switch. You can find the numbers (but not the pins) through LMOS or so I
hear, though I have yet to find any this way since im not much of an LMOS
hacker, so maybe Shock can fill us in on this feature.

I would prefer to do it myself, but I would probally fuck up a $500 fone and
be left with nothing.  I am taking such a full load at school now that I do
not have time to work, thus I have NO money, except what is disappearing from

I have problems modding anything that costs money. I broke many rat shack

I have been playing around with Bell Atlantic's cellular network (BAR) and
have privs (its running an old version of RSTS/Nix based PDP-9 type shit

[[THIS IS THE FIRST FAKE BASE DEATHDLR CREATED FOR US! NOTE THAT >>ALL<< OF
[[THIS INFORMATION IS MADE UP!

Ok boys and girls, this is the start of the LMOS FUN! message base. 
LMOS was the primary phone controlling system up until 1991. It was then
replaced by all forms of COSMOS and SWITCH.
While it isn't used as the primary controller, its features are beyond any of
the others.
You would first need to find your local LMOS/$A dialup (this is the modifying
dialup, the others require specific terminals and are a greater challenge)

Once you are connected at 7e1, it will ask you for a terminal emulation. 
TERM=
Standard emulations are not available in any communications program so I
would recommend just typing @ to make it TTY.
It then shows the file $LOGIN$BANNER$TERM if it exists. This usually doesn't
exist but if it does, it will most likely show company name, your terminal
emulation and other useless things.
99% of the time, since LMOS isn't actively used, it will just drop you to a
l% prompt. Its the main command prompt for LMOS. In very rare occasions it
will drop you to a $LOGIN: prompt. 
Usernames carry the following format.
$ NUMBER $ REGION
for example, in New York, an account would be $001$NYNY for user 001 New
York, New York
Passwords can be anything from 0 to 4 characters. Passwords can only be
numbers. The default accounts on any system requiring a login name are:
$000$CORE
$000$BCORE
$000$CCORE
all the was until ZCORE
Default passwords on every account are 0

So you got past the login! Good job.

Your prompt is l%
from here there are a million things you can do. I will first bring up
billing searches.
(Please note the many phone numbers aren't going to be listed in LMOS since
updating isn't done very often)
l% BB               <- Billing Batch
l% B           <- Billing
BB is very than B because you can do multiple billing entries or a wildcard.
l%914               <- Billing Batch 914
This would show you all of the billing structures of 914. This file is
hundreds of megs long since even disconnected numbers would show up here.
This is useful since it shows you Customer Name, Customer Address, All their
phone bills, Method of payment,
and lots of other interesting th ings. You can not modify the BB readout.

l%_search string_        <- Search
This would do a Search on a certain grou of numbers.
If you were looking for COCOTS in the area you would do S COC for Search COCot
strings available are:
COC=COCOT
BUS=Business
LOC=Local (the standard phone lines)
ATT=AT&T payfones
etc, etc, etc.
This only refers to the Billing data. So if you pay for a business line, it
would show up in the BUS search.

I will continue the lesson my next call. I hope to see some questions coming
my way.

Re: interesting...

LMOS is a very exciting system. I wanted to be an LMOS technician and applied
but they don't exist anymore :) The system is too outdated to be kept up to
par but there are a lot of interesting things we can do with it. For example,
we can modify the packets going through the system and increase the speed of
your process by typing !ZK<processname>. !P lists the processes available to
kill. Most of them are ones that are just left open and never closed (since
processes are often a pain to close) and run for years if you let them.
When I got into my first LMOS, It was slower than hell. I did !P and it
showed processes running for months hogging 95% of processor time just not
doing anything. I did them a favor and killed all processes more than 1 week
old and all the system time was cleared.

Anyone hear about linking LMOS and DN through LLZ or LZL (Both work nearly
the same way) but I don't know what they do exactly. I have linked various
systems through LINK but DN doesn't allow me to because of the connection
characters.

l% LINK TN
5 minute lag...
TN LINKED
tn%l% I can then issue TN commands run through L shells

l% LINK DN
hours of lag... I just hang up

(the above should really read LINK TN;NUMBER;SYSTEMNAME;ACCOUNT, etc but I
didn't do that for clarity above).

DN runs of AIX boxes as does TN (DN is DataNet, TN is Tymnet) in certain
regions. (Tymnet isn't a standard system, 99% of them are the same but when
linking, another connection character is added and it specifies AIX
conntions).

Linking DataNet would let me process DataNet information through LMOS
functions which would make it a lot faster and untraceable because since LMOS
is maintenance, no phone records are kept on LINK connections through it.

yes, I had a chance to mess around with that dialup i got earlier, hehe. i
got in with one of the default logins you mentioned in your first post.
thanks much for the info! i only had a chance to mess around a little with
the billing batch lists, etc. i'll try the !ZK command and !P commands the
next time i login...they sound pretty cool. ttyl

Re: interesting...

There should only be a few processes running. These are:


SRM (Standard Run Module) - should be running 24 hours a day
DL1-9 (Direct Links 1 thru 9) - link to outside systems (gateways)

other processes you might see are aborted billing transactions (since the
LMOS / $A and $B+ all run on different systems but have seperate dialups
which provide different privs) and other aborted processes that were not
killed. These just sit there are run for 24 hours a day scanning the last
sector you were at before you hung up or the system crashed.

They don't need to take care of their systems. The systems aren't widely used

Most of the processes that you see are aborted inquiries about billing, and
other things like that.

Unattended processes include processes to PRINT the billing which runs,
prints and doesn't shut itself down. Also processes to update and sort and

Processes in LMOS are not like processes in unix or anything else. The
process refers to the user logged in which hogs a "Processor". So you're just
making it look like the processor isn't being used. Any processes you RUN are
going to show up.. unless you KILL them afterwards. Its very confusing but
the file $PROCESS contains the logins, while the file that contains the
PROCESSES is called $JOBS or $JOB or $RUN or one of those depending on what
type of job you're going to run. I never run across $JOB or $JOBS but there
are a lot of systems where that is used.

LMOS tries to connect by using

DN's connect us PORT$USER$SYSTEM
l% link DN[PORT$USER$SYSTEM]
To get the port, user and system all you need to do is SH$LINK to show the
link connects it would normally use.
On the DN I use I type "link DN[*TECH*NYSYR]"

That only works when the Datanet system is fully configured for use with
LMOS's link option. I know the above already but what about when its trying
to receive 4 connection variables and we can only supply them with 3?

Instead of unshadowing the password, you might want to specify the encryption

Re: passwd.adjunct

Shadowed password files have various types of encryptions available. The
default encryption type on all systems is DES encryption. What you need to do
is login to a system which runs any copy of Netview or Netlink. Define the
encryption system as none rather than the ones that are listed. Then all you
need to do is do 
$ Netview -L /etc/passwd /etc/shadow -CVT
This runs is and reconfigures it to no encryption. Then
$ cat /etc/passwd
This shows the /etc/passwd file unencrypted
The only works when Netview or Netlink is there or when a system is poorly
configured and /bin/.cnf is left online which defines the type of
configuration and other system stats. But then again, if /bin/.cnf is there
in the first place, you might as well just grab all the root information from
that file.
Another way of doing this which is more difficult would be to load it through
CHCD-3 and do a BINVIEW on the /bin/.cnf file. It will search for it (it
won't be there) and then do a browse within a system and let you read it and
maybe modify it. Thats an idea. BINVIEW would be a pain in the rear to
configure though for use with such an application.

Everyone is having problems connecting collect through Sprintnet. What you
need to do is find your local tymnet system, login with the NUI password,
link port 5 to 6 and stay logged in. You'll be in the system as a hidden
gateway and when people log into

NO! DUNSNET is not accepting X.123 reads or writes. The only time this will
happen is if you're already on a protocol higher than X.25.

all this x.121 talk is making me dizzy. HERES a topic I can relate to. I am
proficient at LMOS enough to use it to find the "backdoors" to radio
stations, 900 numbers, etc... all of these have backdoors, all 900#'s all 976
#'s, etc. All you need to do is find them and you can have all the free toll
services you want, or win radio station prizes whenever you want. I havent
paid to see a concert for 3 years, and I see every show I want. All you need
to do is execute the command 'bb an(toll number)' this will list all unlisted
backdoor numbers associated with the toll number/front end TIE line number
(if its a radio station) it is BROWSE BATCH +ALL NUMBERS ( ASSOCIATED NUMBER)
but this is ONLY for TIE lines and for toll numbers, as they use their own
special toll switch, usually an ATT switch, i forget which one. Enjoy!

what the fuck? It was in the directory /cur/locuse/bak
which is where they keep information on, actually backups of, local (non ROAM
usage) I stayed with non ROAM because so many roam pairs are tumbled, i didnt
want bad ones, plus I can use local pairs to forward from. I even had to
compile a good version of sz on the system because theirs was fucked and
didnt work worth a shit, what crappy admins they have. They have the lamest

Re: New Base

One of the major networks through which strings (non-encrypted packets) are
sent is CHCD-3. It means something like Call Hindered Cyphering Datanetwork
version 3.0 which is just a network that sends packets between others such as
LMOS and Switch. If you can seize a string on the network its often filled
with such things as Switch dialups and accounts, same for LMOS, and other
things. Its extremely useful and NOT encrypted.

Re: LMOS SE

It would be really nice to have a list of LMOS dialups everywhere. I don't
have a problem since I have my local dialup and I can easily just login to
ANY lmos linked to it (which is a majority of the LMOS systems in this
country in some way or another. it would just take time). 

You would probably have to talk to someone who does the technical stuff at
the switches. Those idiots who walk around and do voltage tests and plug them
in and unplug them, etc. They are the only ones dumb enough to give you the
dialups who would have the current one at hand.

route tracing to the local Switch-7 through the $B please.

They'll have no idea what you're talking about, put on a supervisor, he'll

supply me with all the foney user's passwords.  If you can I
will most certainly leave the system down for ever.  If not
then nothing is wrong.  You make up all kinds of shit in

2.No matter what, I will not be upset, well actually I will, but
I will not hold it against you.  I beleive that you did not
create the accounts.  Maybee one of them.  You lack the ss skills
of adam.  Adam types way to slow.  Neither of you know much.

Believe me, I was the one who did the social engineering there. Adam only used
one of the accounts -- I used the rest.

Actually, I thought you already found out about it (thats why your board was dow
n i thought) so I made the files public... oh well.. should have taken them
offline last night.

Anyway, verify those passwords..
and here's how it all started.

I logged in as sponge.. filled out the infoform pretty well.. (but i bullshitted
 on it a lot).. we were talking in chat and I was tell you about LMOS and shit a
nd you said (not verbatim) "damn, if only i got that type of technical stuff in
my message bases"... so I offered to run LMOS FUN! for ya.. and it worked...

Then i started logging on as the other guys and always leaching files, telling
you about deep south run off an x.25 that has encrypted software and that I
didn't even have the updated key because it changes to often..

Ask me any more questions and I can answer them...

I guess thats how plea bargains work these days. I'm not complaining

okay, give me a # where I can contact you sometime, I've got trash from 
the Spartan systems, and have found that if you wait alittle bit, usually 
someone forgets to logoff right. There really is not much interesting on 
[more]       the system, but their is a command that prompts you for a password, and 
another comand which displays abnormal call patterns or something like 
that. I have logs, I'll dig them up and post them.

Yes, but a Spectrum is. And my comments were related to the Spectrum as 
being similar to Spartans in which a terminal is required to do anything 
significant.

How to make half+half plastic milk thing bombs
----------------------------------------------
Written by: TOM THE TURD


INTRODUCTION:
    This file was composed in December of 94, so it is by far the newest, and
after you read this you will see that it is by far the safest of all previous
d0p3 files.  Hopefully you will learn a little bit about chemistry (although
I doubt it) and not just how to blow things up.  I myself am not a chemist,
and have had no more than high school chemistry.  This recipe is a modified
form of the one found in the ANARCHIST COOKBOOK, but much better.  It was
obtained from a grad student in chemistry at one of top universities (for
chemistry at least) in the nation.  His name and the university are not
mentioned for purposes of privacy.
    As most people know, nitroglycerin is an extremely powerful explosive,
used largely today by industry, and made in huge cement mixers that hold
hundreds of gallons.  It is not safe to make, and you shouldn't even think of
making any unless you plan to use it (and don't make more than you need).  I
personally do not condone the use of nitroglycerin at all--this file is for
informational purposes only.  I hope anyone who does make some has had at
least some chemistyr and a little bit of brains.  The last thing anyone wants
to hear is how some 14 year old punk blew himself up trying to make nitro.
    One last thing.  I encourage you to upload this file to other systems, but
I insist that my name and club remain.

MATERIALS:
    1) 70% concentrated nitric acid
    2) 98% concentrated sulfuric acid
    3) Glycerin
    4) Baking soda
    5) A *GOOD* thermometer and glassware (beakers, glass rod-stirring device,
  test tubes, eyedropper, whatever--must be all glass materials though.
  Acid eats everything else.  Also, whatever you use to hold your
  solutions should have as thin a glass wall as possible--to diffuse heat
  faster.)
    6) Very large ice-bath
    7) Gloves, Goggles, etc.
    8) Blue litmus paper
    9) Kitchen sink

OBTAINING MATERIALS:
    Nitric acid can be bought for about $19+ per gallon (it's cheaper to buy
in this quantity).  You need to be 21, but some chemical places don't card.
    Sulfuric acid can be bought the same way, at $14+ per gallon.
    Glycerin can be bought at any drug store.  You won't need half as much
glycerin as acid.  The actual quantity and ratio varies--and is really
unimportant in this recipe.
    The thermometer and glassware, etc., can be bought by anyone, but it's
cheaper to 'borrow' from chem lab.  If you have to buy, there should be a
place near any college campus that sells the stuff.

THE REACTION:

  H
  !
H-C-O-NO2
  !
H-C-O-NO2 ===========>     N2 + CO2 + O2 + H2O
  !
H-C-O-NO2
  !
  H

PROCEDURE:
    1)  Mix by volume 3 parts sulfuric acid with 1 part nitric.  Add the
sulfuric to the nitric *NOT* vice versa (you never add water to acid because
it splatters, and the nitric is 30% water).  Your beaker/test tube should be
contained in the ice bath because this solution is gets *HOT*--but isn't
dangerous, yet.  Stir a little bit, but don't put your face right over it
(vapors). Wait til it cools to 0-5 degrees centigrade.  You'll need to rig
some kind of contraption, if you don't have the proper lab equipment, in order
to keep the thermometer from touching the edge of the beaker/test tube--an
accurate reading is *VERY* important.
    2)  Once the acids are cool enough you can start adding glycerin.  While
stirring constantly, use the eyedropper and add about 5 drops.  If the heat
doesn't rise, add 8 drops, and see what happens.  Keep adding larger amounts
until the temperature rises.  Once it does, wait (don't stop stirring til at
least 30 seconds after adding glycerin) for the temperature to drop back down
to 0-5 degreees centigrade.  DON'T EVER LET THE TEMPERATURE GET ABOVE 30
DEGREES CENTIGRADE--If you do, you lose.  It might not blow up, but it will
decompose, and you'll get nothing but garbage (the person who designed this
recipe has had it go as high as 40 and not explode).  To be safe, keep it
below 20 degrees centigrade, and if it gets above that, dump the whole thing
in the ice bath (there better be plenty of ice too, cause sulfur and water
react, and you need plenty of ioce to keep that reaction cool).  The
nitroglycerin reaction is done when the glycerin you add no longer affects the
temperature.
    3)  The nitroglycerin is slowly decomposing at this point, so you want to
work fast here.  The sulfuric has only been a catalyst for the reaction and
needs to be washed out.  Fill a container 10x the volume of your solution with
ice water (again, ice is important cause sulfur and water react giving off
enough heat to set off the nitro) and add your solution to it.  Stir
thoroughly (nitro and water don't mix).  Let the nitro seperate (it will
settle to the bottom) and pour off the water (acids and all) down the drain.
Put your saolution under the tap and add more water.  Stir again and let
settle (settling can be helped by adding a little of ordinary dishsoap--like
half a drop).  Pour off again.  Repeat the process 3 or 4 times.  Make sure
*ALL* the water is poured off (to get the last little bit, try dragging paper
it stays blue, everything is fine.  If it turns red, wash your solution a few
more times.
    4)  After the solution is 'clean', wash with a baking soda solution (1
tsp./ quart of water).  Follow the same steps outlined above, but only wash
once.  Pour your final solution into a glass bottle.  Put in the fridge.

CAUTIONS:
    First of all, stor nitroglycerin in a cool place--like the fridge (or try
the freezer.  I don't know what the freezing point is).  Label it so nobody
accidently dumps it or drinks it.  If you still live at home, then bury it in
the fridge and disguise it so your parents wouldn't want to touch it or
examine it.  You don't really need to keep it that cold.  You could fairly
safely store it in your closet.  Although if you live in an area with extreme
heat (like Palm Springs) it might not be a good idea.  Don't breath the vapors
or swallow any--you'll get a short but incredible headache.  If you touch some
you'll get the headache of your life that will last up to 12 hours.

DETONATION:
    What you wil probably want to try as soon as you make nitroglycerin is a
simple little experiment to prove to yourself it works.  Put *ONE* drop on a
paper towell and strike with a hammer.
    Nitro, in this form, is not all that easy to blow up.  Throwing a bottle
of the stuff at a wall or dropping it off a five story building will do
nothing more than break the bottle.  The best way to detonate nitroglycerin is
with a wax coated firecracker taped on the inside of your container.

VARIATIONS:
    Putty-  Mix your final solution with sawdust or diatomacious earth (which
you can get at pool stores) to the consistency of silly putty.  All this does
is make your nitro easier to work with.

    Flash Paper-  This is a little more difficult to make, a little safer, and
maybe more fun.  Instead of adding glycerin to your acids in step 2, use gun
cotton (*REAL* cotton).  You don't have to watch the temperature either.  Just
toss a bunch of cotton in and let it soak up your solution  (don't be stupid
though--add them slowly the first time).  You don't need to be in as much of a
rush either because it doesn't decompose as fast.  You're nitrating the
cotton, so let it sit a couple hours in the mix.  Then pour off all the acid
and wash in water (the same way you wash regular nitro), then after it's
fairly clean you can pull out the cotton  and wash by hand--*VERY WELL*.  Let
the cotton dry out, then put a piece in a jar with a very small amount of
acitone (which you can purchase at any hardware store and is perfectly safe).
The cotton will dissolve like cotton candy in water.  Any cotton left in the
jar should be taken out.  Now let the acitone evaporate.  There will be a
small plastic-like film at the bottom of the jar.  You can light this stuff
like flash paper.
    Jelly-  If you are brave you can dissolve the 'flash paper' in nitro and
get a jelly like substance that is quite powerful and easier to work with.
Use very little nitro and a lot of 'flash paper' (you'll have to experiment to
find what works best for the consistency you want.

FINAL WORDS:
    Once the above is done, take a plastic milk thing from dennys, poke a
hole in it and throw it at someone. It'll go SPLAT!

LAST WORD:
    By all means--*DON'T BE STUPID!*

niggah-spick-jew-wanna be who don't even have a real pimpstah hat from the
Hommiee Hutt.  (It's where Jabba the Hutt got his hat.)  She will have sex
with y0, y0 mammah, and y0 daddah f0' one dollah.  Trust mez... this is the
borne again Kri$ Kr0$, and I wouldn't lie to y0 all.  I was borne again after
escaping from Susan the daddy-mack w3rd's meth-house.  I quit sniffing laundry
detergent up my n0strels and now I write f0 CdC againh.  But call this Jessica
h0!  602-996-2748!@#  Call her!  It's like 900-numbah sex only bettah!  She is
the daddy mack, and that ain't no w3rd.

She wears c00l shoes that look like bunnie rabbitz on acid... she will sit
there on the phone and talk to y0 4 hrs.  Trust me.  You can visit her at
Paradise Valley Mall.  Zhe w0rkz at Surf TurdZ.  Niggah.

1-602-996-2748 - Ask f0 Jessica, and then ask f0 hot sex.

1a] Jennize Potion Dayz

Mahatma's Jennize was l00kin' for zome potionz to buy f0 a regulah CdC
x-mas... dat's when we got kicked outtah PV mall.  Potionz are like the 0gr3
imp3arm3nt rating, but bettah.  They co$t a lottah money and they can be used
when talking to Jessica on her 996 line to masterbate to.  ;bgdbgvkx w3rd.

1b] ViD30 ArcAd3

The PV mall arCaD3 is k-spiff.  There is this broken airhockey game there that
you can play while sitting on (or pu$hing up) stool.  It is k-rad.  No, it's
k-radf-spiff-3133+.

1c] Aaronz the Mack

He's still lame and gay, in a bad non spiff way.  This doesn't belong here,
but neither doez an ear.  w3rd.

mall right n0w.  w3rd.

2] CdC stains..

Joy Division-- she's lost control again! w3rd! we were doing the usual
felching as we were listening to this song and what do ya know? a bottle of
CdC powah cola spilled on the carpet.. it made a stain. it bubbled. it was
eleet... no, it was 3l33t.. no, it was 3133+ on the vato HYP3 tip f00.

3] Dave Moss..

He WAS a freshman who we picked on. Now we have a big crush on him and want to
lure him into kris' bedroom and lubricate him up and down. Here he is. he's
chained up ... and connected to a donkey.

..Den we have da Homey mack-dad Shlemma. He can never stop shakin danks to a
mishap concerning 2 water balloons, four hitchhikers, six cantelopes and a
semi. He's one fucked up nigga. Shlemma is in love with some damn broad-bitch.
I think the bitch's name is skankin' Amy. She got with four guys in one fuckin
hour only two of them survived. She also had a hairy cyst removed from her ass
yesterday. Shlemma's best homey is da shit-packin Nodinroggin. Nodinroggins
brodda used to live around da block from Ice-T, Ice-Cube,Snoop, and some
fuckers named Stone Temple Pirates. Well, actually pilots.

Anyway, back to the back to the beach ya'll. I'm packin' it. A tisket, a
