<CdC> Netta, Mahatma Mcaf33 from CdC here again..
Since Issue 207 of our magazine, there has been a lot of mail pouring into
our boxes from many people who support you. And, to our surprise, no one has
had the guts to flame you or insult you in any way.. except when they weren't
looking and our buffers were going... Did you know you had so many friends 
on the net?
<grayarea> I think most people don't care if I am around or not as long as
I don't get in their way. But of those who have an opinion, I am sure more
like me than my enemies. I'm still here. I can usually get unbanned. 
And when things have seemed at their worst, people have made it clear 
that they wanted me to stay. I give good conversation. I think this has
been an interesting experiment though. I wonder if you made it a regular 
thing to interview all the controversial people on #hack whether others 
would fare as well as I did <grin>.   
<CdC> You've already discussed your dealings with Brotherhood-Of-Warez and
u4ea in the last issue -- do you think they'll stop harassing you now that
they see that a lot more people like you than like them? Everyone seems to
support you in your efforts..
<grayarea> I thought I explained it last issue. Funny how everyone wants to
hear things are awful rather than good <grin>. I think I'll answer your
question by saying CdC207 upset several people that I know of. One of them 
sent me two pieces of E-mail but apparently didn't follow up by contacting 
you as I suggested was the appropriate response. He was mentioned in your
question about the identities of the WELL crackers and although I assume you 
intended his name as a joke, he took great offense that people might be
trying to "frame" him for it. That didn't stop him from trying to "frame" me
a few days later when he claimed to have .gifs of me having sex with a
hacker I never kissed. He said he was "being friendly." I think he behaved 
like a hypocrite who likes to start trouble and can't take it when the shoe 
is on the other foot.
   To quote the Grateful Dead, "new ones comin' as the old ones go." Once 
again it's someone I didn't start with, this time using the "spyace" acct at 
MindVox (which I was told by one of the account holders is actually shared
by four hacker elites), came on #Hack and accused me of making up my contacts 
with law enforcement for attention. He didn't really want proof or a reply, 
just to rag on me. He's collided me a bunch since. Guess he's jealous or 
threatened by me somehow. Must be a sign I'm doing something right <grin>. 
If he keeps it up, I'll just keep mentioning it in my interviews. I can't 
collide people, sniff their accounts, or turn phones into payphones, but I 
find that just telling everyone the truth about who bothers me works wonders.  
   Yet another person has opened an acct using the name "Hillel Gilboa." 
Hillel is a Jewish word (as in j00ish), unlikely to be used as a name. 
My last name is quite uncommon. I think the coincidence of another Gilboa 
suddenly appearing on #hack speaks for itself. This account 
(gilboa@babbage.csee.usf.edu) is not mine. Opening accounts which play on my 
real data crosses a line. Enough said. I think the fact universities and 
other site providers don't take this stuff seriously is a shame. Gray Areas
printed a story about the WELL's mishandling of being cracked. 2600 did one
on Netcom. And I don't trust law enforcement to know the difference between 
me and someone setting me up either. At present, a person harassed on the 
Internet has nowhere to turn in society. Whether I want them to or not, my 
experiences on #hack shape how I think about the Net and its potential. It is 
hard to continue believing in anarchy when you are so often its target. Alas, 
I no longer think the Net is such a great thing. 
<CdC> Someone who rapes (in a positive way) the minds of hackers with true 
conversation is often a threat to people who are often seen as social 
outcasts.
<grayarea> You said it, not me <grin>. It's quite clear I am seen as a threat,
ironically by the very people who claim society misunderstands them. It's
almost as if a group of hackers got together and decided they would rather
have my magazine say awful things about hackers than nice things. And so,
no matter how much I try to see the whole picture and not get caught up in
their treatment of me, these people keep creating problems for me so that I
cannot do my work. They want to ruin it for thousands of other hackers. See,
the hacking community does not police itself and there is no central agree-
ment anywhere in this community. What they fail to realize is the laws
against hacking are strengthening and more and more of them will end up in
court in the next decade. When they do, the people deciding on how much jail
time they get will be people whose opinions about hackers come from the 
media. I believe hackers should do everything they can to improve their
image in the media. However, their treatment of me is clear proof they won't.
<CdC> Issue 208 is coming out real soon and it will have a "Letters to the
Editor" section completely filled with grayarea comments. I am sure you'll be 
surprised at all the things people are saying and maybe some of the people 
who are saying these things.
<grayarea> Heh. I'm sure you've heard from a good cross-section of the
people who like me and hate me the most. The ones who hate me are 
oh-so-vocal about it, but there are many, many more of the quiet, supporting 
ones. 
<CdC> Since we're on the topic of donkeys, how's your obsession with large
furry animals going? I know you are sad that merc and Bubba are getting
married in jail now -- you just lost a good bestiality partner there --
What are your plans for future sadomasochistic and animal husbandry events
centered around hackers?
<grayarea> Although I didn't catch too much shit for that last issue, people
definitely made it clear they are used to me being serious all the time and
I caught them off-guard there. You're a good reporter. I told you last issue 
that Merc wouldn't want me talking about him in this context and here you are 
trying to get me to comment again <grin>. I have no future plans. Except
maybe to befriend Bubba <grin>. It's probably the only way I'll ever get to
talk to Merc again <grin>.
<CdC> Thanks again for your input.. We wish you the best of luck.  
<grayarea> Thanks. I'll need it. As you've learned the hard way, even people
who try to help clean up my image are harassed. I hope now that this issue
is done your account will be left alone. I know mine won't be <grin>.

Was it a virus or something that you couldn't pick up?  Or a file someone
lamer phucker created designed to fuck with your system?

Virus and passes it onto my floppies for me.. Thank god I caught it..
We had to trash a HD at work due to that virus.. Mcaffess lists that Virus
as UNCURRABLE.. We don't have it or ANY virii.. I'm 100% sure of that, I've
checked :) Then Markus gets some other fucked up Virii and now I can't trust
THOSE floppies I lent him either.. FUCK.. I want a Tape backup badly!!
Anyone else Getting Virused??? Where are they coming from??

A while back a nice fellow named Death Dealer made (or had a program make
some for him) a few virii and threatened to pass them around.. That was a
long time ago though..
-----
We suffered a MAJOR HIT, If you see a file called NECROMAN.ZIP ANYWHERE! DO
NOT GET IT, I ran the INSTALL.EXE and it ate our FAT Table.. We did have Tape
backup.. But any/all files uploaded after monday 12/20 was LOST.. Please
Re-upload and I'll issue ya Double the credits for the mishap..

to explain what the fuck happened..
on 12-21-94 I "ZILCH" downloaded a file called NECROMAN.ZIP from the danger
zone bbs in Arizona. This file turned out to a TROJAN.. All it did was FDISK
my 420 megger for me.. No big whoop, beings that I have Tape Backup.
Me, Brain Smasher, Deadman, and Two other Unknown users downloaded this file.
I e-mailed the sysop of TDZ (danger zone) Right away with my warning..
Bigguy, the Sysop, didn't hesitate to lend a hand at all.. 
He killed the File right away.. Then .PHATKEDS uploaded a file Called
CRASH.001 wich was a text file stating that the Trojan was a succes.. and
that I was a LAMER and whimpered.. Let the record show, We have a GOOD IDEA
WHO this fucker is.. and maybe through this file you will see it too..
The Messages USED in CRASH.001 weren't posted untill 12-22-94 around 8am..
The date and time that our bbs went back online.. With this info I contacted
Bigguy, The sysop over at TDZ..

Between us we found out that the file was uploaded by: .PHATKEDS at 9:30pm
on 12-22-94. Bigguy deleted the file Right away and was a GREAT help..
I do wish to thank him for his Quickness in Aided me..
With that info.. It would mean that WHOEVER created it, HAD to have logged
onto OUR system between 8am and 9:30pm.. This is the LOG with my OPPION of
the users.. As far as I see it.. and who I feel is MORE Guilty..
The actuall LOG is filename SHITLIST.TXT.

-
8:08 Am I logged on a re uploaded the missing files.. Since only C: was 
affected, the NEW uploads were Still around, just not listed cuz our backup
was like two days old. :)

Tough one here.. We never talked before NECROMAN came out..
He approached me with his Cries for help.. Parts on me Trusts him while
other parts on me Suspects him.. WHY?? Cuz he came Forward with it first.
Could be a cover-up..What do you think?

We went on a quest to find ILF.. and we got an exclusive interview with them!

CDC: HI THIS IS MAHATMA MCAF33 OF CULT OF THE DEAD CAT, WHO DIS?
ILF: THIS IS PHIGAN.
CDC: OK, WHO ARE YOU?
ILF: I AM THE MAIN MEMBER OF ILF.
CDC: HOW DID ILF START?
ILF: I WAS TALKING TO MY FRIEND ON THE TELEPHONE AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE
 CALLED A BIG BBS CALLED INTERNET AND IT GAVE HIM A $ PROMPT. I SAID THAT
 IT WAS OBVIOUS CREATED BY SOME BIG GOVERNMENT CORPORATION AND THEY MUST
 ALL DIE DIE DIE AND THAT IT LOOKED FUNNY.
CDC: WHAT HAPPENED THEN?
ILF: WE PLAYED AROUND FOR A WHILE AND WE STARTED TALKING TO A GUY WHO SAID
 THAT HE COULD HACK. WE ASKED HIM HOW AND HE GAVE US A BUNCH OF 3L33T SCRIPTS
 AND SHIT THAT COULD FAKEMAIL. WE STARTED FAKEMAILING AND THEN WE LEARNED TO
 ASCII UPLOAD SHIT AND WE STARTED MAIL BOMBING.
CDC: WHAT DID YOU ASCII UPLOAD?
ILF: SHIT LIKE, MAIL GRAYAREA@NETAXS.COM < BIGFILE.TXT. IT HAD A MILLION
 LINES BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW TO CUT AND PASTE AND SHIT. IT WAS ELEET. IT WAS
 WAY FUKEN ELEET.
CDC: SO WHAT DOES ILF STAND FOR?
ILF: IT MEANS INTERNET LOOKS FUNNY. WE GOT THE NAME BECAUSE INTERNET LOOKS
 FUNNY WITH THE $ PROMPT AND SHIT. IT LOOKS REALLY FUKEN FUNNY.
CDC: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF L0CK, MOD, LOD AND EVERYONE ELSE?
ILF: THEY SUK, WE FUKEN R00L.
CDC: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD?
ILF: YEAH! CHANGE THE DAMN $ PROMPT TO SOMETHING ELSE. IT WILL MAKE US STOP
 MAILBOMBING GRAYAREA THE B1TCH.
CDC: ARE YOU THE REAL ILF?
ILF: I THINK SO.
CDC: OK, BYE.

We kept looking for more ILF members to interview.
I was on IRC and got this.
*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#
*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#
*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#

*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#
*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#
*j00* this is an IRC bomb from the ILF!@#
How did they do that? I don't know, they must be 3l33t. So I /msg'd j00
/msg j00 Hey are you the ILF? Can I interview you for CdC?
*j00* zur3!@#!@#
CDC: J00, WHO ARE YOU?
J00: I AM ONE OF THE MOST ELEET PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I KNOW HOW TO ASCII
 UPLOAD INTO MY TERM PROGRAM TO SEND A MILLION /MSG COMMANDS AND ANNOY
 PEOPLE.
CDC: WHAT IF THEY /IGNORE J00 ALL YOU?
J00: FUK Y00! D0 YOU WANT AN INTERVIEW OR NOT?
CDC: OK, SORRY 0H 3L33T J00. WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO?
J00: WE MAIL BOMB PEOPLE AND TALK TRASH BECAUSE WE'RE 3L33T.
CDC: IS THAT ALL?
J00: NO, WE BREAK INTO LARGE CORPORATE COMPUTERS ON THE INTERNET, FIND BUGS
 THAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF AND TRY TO THROW THE LARGE CORPORATIONS OFF
 OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY ALL SUCK AND WE WANT THE INTERNET BACK FOR US
 HACKERS.
CDC: OH, NO BIG DEAL. BACK TO THE MAILBOMBING. ITS KEWL.
J00: YEAH I KNOW! I GOTTA GO. I AM WORKING ON A NEW MAILBOMB. I'LL TRY IT
 OUT ON YOU.
Suddenly I got:
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!

*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
*j00* ALL CAPS IRCBOMB!
Damn, looks like ILF has struck again. I kept looking for more ILF members
but all I got was a bunch of idiots saying that they hacked pipeline.com,
and shit like that. But thats probably something else...

Then all of a sudden I got a mail on my bbs:

I knew this had to mean something. I called him up (since he left a voice
telephone number.
