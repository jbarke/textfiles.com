I can honestly say I was a proud member. I was on back not TOO long ago when 
The Necro was still public. Then, due to some legal problems about the content
of it's messages, it had to go underground. Then, about a week ago, it went 
COMPLETELY underground... offline. I've got some old text-captures of times 
when I logged on... maybe I'll post some for old-times sake!

It was a dark and stormy night on 2 Jun 94  04:21,
When Jerith saw Duuk Tsarith screaming at the moon:

It is gone, the era has ended.  Don't worry about what was.  Concentrate on 
what is.  It wasn't really secret.  It was one of a kind though.  Hopefully 
what sorc is cooking up next will be even better.

I really liked Sorc (listen to me! I'm talking as if he died!)... I really 
thought he was an arrogant dick at first... but you just have to understand, 
and eventually appreciate the way he thinks. I'd almost consider him a good 
friend... but I guess that's not supposed to happen in modemland.

I'd used the Necro for so long that it became second nature for me just to 
logon every night. It's like waking up in the same room every day... you just 
grow to expect that same poster on the wall to be there, and the same blankets
over you, and the same furniture. Just call me stupid.... but I guess it just 
fits my conservative nature.

    Yeah, I know what you mean.  I suffered a little withdrawl when it went 
underground and I was (for some as yet unexplained reason) lost in the 
shuffle.  It was a couple weeks before I got back on...the worst couple weeks 
of my life!  :-)  Just think of it as moving.  How's that?

Yeah!  Great idea.  Maybe we cant get some of the old gang together and have a
special base for used to be members of the Necropolis.  We can try to dig up 
all of the DDE files we can.  And we could talk to Elmmy and Sorc about trying
to continue DDE.

What do you think?

It's an underground, private board (called Necropolis) that you have to be
invited by another user to get on. It's considered to be the best 
board in
the county, and I'd have to agree. I got on back when it didn't used to be
private, so it was easy to get on then. But, due to some legal problems in
reguards to the content of the messages posted, it had to go underground.

But, actually - Sorc (the sysop) has had the board off-line for the last
week.

The only 'legal problems' were threats that either Larry or Chris made
periodically regarding 'defamation of character' or whatnot.  The only factor
that coincided with this was that Ryan (and most of the users) were tired of
the regular harrassment.

yeah, I know, incorrect verb tense in the third line - I'm too lazy to fix it
right now.

Tsunami is on Black ICe.  I miss Azzy... (Sniff) Petula Clark, The Ferret, 
Virgen Sacrafice, and others may be gone from the modem world for good.  
Since, Ryan was their friend and the Necro was the only BBS they called.  I

Buckwheat, SOE, Sorc (assuming he still calls KAOS), You, me, Jerith, and 
Danimal.  All is not lost.

It was a dark and stormy night on 8 Jun 94  16:16,
When Jerith saw Spirit Of Entropy screaming at the moon:

    Yeah, I don't think your average G.O. student sees the same Sorc that we 
do.  You should've seen his picture in the senior issue.  Not too good.  
Everybody was oohing and ahhing at it all day long.  I though it was pretty 
funny.  One girl I was sitting with at lunch was talking about how she had to 
sit behind him on the bus on a long debate trip.  She described him as "scary"
and was getting lots of sympathy from this other girl on the speech team.

Actually, sarcastic though you meant this, you're right.  There was no one 
major theme to Necroplis...that's what made it great...the diversity that 
existed therein.

I mean to argue your point that all Necrop was was a put-down board (sorry for
the double word usage) I merely said that if something deserves to be put 
down...and then justified why I thought TCC needed put down.  If my words 
seemed strong to you, they probably seemed mild to some others I can think of.

What in the hell does that have to do with the quality of the system?  I'll 
grant you longevity is one measure by which a BBS's success can be shown, but 
Necrop ceased because it's operator decided it was no longer what he had in 
mind...not because the users no longer wanted it.  There's a VERY distint 
difference there.  TCC is still running...so what...it just proves what I've 
always beleived...there are a great deal more stupid people in the world than 
there are people worth their skin.  90% of the worthwile modem users I've met 
I met at Necrop...I've met some very decent and well-spoken people at TCC, 
too, but the ratio of users to worthwile users of those two boards are 
absolutely on different planets.

I did not contradict myself at all...I said it was the users and the sysop, 
and that Renegade merely provided an easy medium for those users to operate 
within...read the thing, I just repeated myself in a more succinct way.

Well all I ever here from former Nec callers is put-downs to TCC.

Well what the hell kind of sysop is that?  He was just showing his power on 
how he can leave you hanging and now he has control of you.
Az> I did not contradict myself at all...I said it was the users and the sysop,
Yes you did!  Here is a trans-dialog of what you said:

It is the users that make the BBS.  Renegade is what made it so good to exist.
