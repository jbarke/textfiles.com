NOTE! From AMPHETAMINE GOBBLER!

  Oh, boy! You faithful DDE readers are in for a treat this time!
We have a never-before-seen super pre-release of a _Big Bush Fan_
article by a NEW staff member - Mango. BBF has been put on 
"suspended" hiatus for the timebeing and thus, this story is
being distributed first electronically. Enjoy. This is the first
peak at BBF: The New Generation. ... er sumthin.

                
                           'Satanic Justice'
   
        A great man once wrote that it is every man's duty to consider 
all sides of an issue. That all sides must be heard and considered if 
justice is to be done. It is upon this premise that I base my choice 
of a companion for the evening.
  Assuming that such exists, I would like to spend an evening with Lucifer, 
the prince of darkness.
Being that God has written all the books, it is no wonder that Satan has 
been portrayed as a lying serpent. After all, the Hebrew word for Satan 
simply means adversary. Considering this, one has to think that if any 
of us had the chance to shape the world's opinion of someone who opposed 
us, we would probably be none to king the unfortunate soul.
  As for the crimes of which he is accused, Satan's rebellion against 
God could be a liberation from tyranny, for even according to the 
Almighty himself, God's word is law. What was that definition of 
tyranny again?
Assuming Satan did rebel (after all if God is a tyrant he could also 
be a liar) we could consider him and his follower's revolutionaries, 
much like our forefathers. Instead of the minion of evil he is often 
portrayed as, we might consider Satan the ideological father of the 
American Revolution and one of the first advocates of liberty. 
Perhaps our pledge of allegiance should read "one nation under 
Lucifer."
  Finally, Satan gave man knowledge of good and evil. As the philosopher 
Friedrich Nietzsche pointed out, this knowledge is essential for true 
freedom. Why should we condemn the one who gave us liberty? 
  When we consider the weight of evidence, it is essential that we 
take another look at Satan, and give him the fair hearing that he deserves.
One last thing- remember the opening thoughts concerning justice. They 
were spoken by Christ himself.
