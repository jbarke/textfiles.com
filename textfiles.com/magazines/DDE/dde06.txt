                 'A Prelude to Discourse on Telecom'
      
And YEA - shalt one see that which is not. Or sumthin. Ok, here's
text file nostalgia trivia... t-files used to be a way to say 'hi'
to people you know just because you knew that everyone would end
up seeing the thing. They were called 'greets' and then later that
term applied more to the outgoing message on a codeline or VMB
directory. Anyway, in that vein, might I go out on a limb to send
a few greets before this t-file gets buzzing:
 Spirit of Entropy - the snare  of the DDE, Nate - the  silly
 Bohemian writer we know from Denny's,  Danny B. - THE man to
 see, Deloris - the best  mad phone  woman in  the world, and
 all of our friends from the JEW Krew (Ed, THC, Ziltron, Buck,
 and Iceboy) ... where  have  you  all  been?  We  need  more 
 Killian's! Oh...  just kidding... the alcohol is nice but we
 also like yer company..           


    ... or was that Molson Ice?

Ok, now on with the show.
                                                                

This is a chat that I happened to have with a sysop in the 510 area
code. He and I have become modem buddies since then. It reveals 
some of the angst that the Enlightened feel when looking at the
current situation of the modem world. Its something to read.


Powerful Paul shakes off his stupor to address you...


Geez, nice connection.  OK, it's not quite setup yet.  But I have a BILLION
files on blue boxing and breaking into credit reporting systems that have
been down for a billion years, and I htought they needed to be in a
historical archive.  It seemed a lot cooler before I actually looked at it.

Oh, no.. it looks good. Actually, its better cuz you know.. most of the hp
files around today have been around forfuckinever and so.. people get
confused and do bad things that get them in trouble in 1994 Bell Affiliate
security technology, you know?

Exactly!  See, there's maybe..........1/50th of the files on here that are
still applicable.  Most of 'em were written when we were on XBar, and if you
do that shit now, they lock you up.  But people don't understand that.
This way I was hoping people could be more wary of believing what they
read...

That's actually a good idea. You know, that pisses me off that more text
files aren't being written lately. Before (lke 2-3 yrs ago) t-files would be
uploaded like everyday.. original ones. The telecom scene - at least where I
am is seriously deficient in the creative process.
   
Tell me about it.  This place used to have an active H/P message base, but
no one has posted on it in YEARS.  Some people got busted, most of 'em
just got real jobs and didn't have time anymore.  But ALL of them recognized
how much harder it was getting to hide...

Yeah, I wouldn't even care if it wasn't all hp shit though. Just ANYTHING.
Shawn-dlb, for instance. Geez, I would never see something like that
nowadays and if I went and did something like that, most people wouldn't
appreciate it anyway.

Yes!  There used to be a million groups who would just write text files.
That's it.  cDc and all that.  Well, I guess they're still around, but I'm
not sure.  Nobody does it anymore.  I actually never really thought about it.
Maybe it's because everybody got big modems and hard drives and just started
downloading games all the time...

Maybe. But the boards in 216 used to be really good... now, each one of them
seems like there should be a big Xerox stamp right on them... anyone with
Renegade, a modem and a CD_Rom slaps up a BBS and expects it to be the best.
I want BBS'es with personality ... character ... a little heart dammit!
sniff

Damn straight!  See, I think everybody SHOULD have their own BBS.  Because
everybody SHOULD have their own character, and a BBS is really just an
extenstion of the sysop's character, with flavoring thrown in by the user
base.  A buddy of mine once described it as "the sysop's mind laid bare for
all the users to pick at and play around in."  But when you just get
Renegade start-up menus and put up message bases called, "General," 
"IBM," "Mac," it makes me SICK!

Yes! Exactly! Wow.. all of us should move and make our own area code,
hehe.. but I see BBS'es as just another expression of art ... sort of
an electronic aestheticism, if that's a word. People who just slap it
up make me ill. Anyway, I think you get the point.. we seem to be
right on the same wavelength.

Indeed.  I like you. Maybe I'll have to call your board.  Damn long 
distance companies.  At least it's probably cheaper to call Ohio 
than LA these days...

Yeah, Pacific Bell is probably just as big a rapist as Ohio Bell is.

Yeah, they're all the same.  (grrrr.)  Makes you wish it WEREN'T so hard to   
get free phone calls these days...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A meeting of the minds, to say the very least...

WARNING: A RANT/RAVE IS ABOUT TO OCCUR. 

Anyway, a few more thoughts on telecom. Bulletin boards must be
viewed from an aesthetic perspective. BBS'es are a work of art.
They are a form of communication that allows a lot of creative
interpretation. Unfortunately, most sysops see themselves as
technicians instead of artists. This is bad. A good bulletin
board has character ... spirit ... life. A CD-Rom and an Internet
feed does not make substance. 

Another final thought that just came to me. Truth is the proper
evaluation of subjective circumstance. Proper evaluation, in its
most pure form, would require ALL information about a situation.
I mean an abstract view of information ... every scrap of data
that is in existence would have to be represented. Thus, the 
most accessible information is, the amount of truth rises in
direct proportion. We can conclude then that we should strive
for freedom of information, to uphold truth.. 

Or sumthin.

Anyway, that's it.
