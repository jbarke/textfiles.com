[Subject ] Farewell...


 They say all good things must come to an end.  So it is with The Amiga Asylum.
I find I can no longer give the system the time it deserves.  Therefore after
2+ years of serving the Amiga community,  The Asylum will close it's doors this
Saturday,  April 30th.  I want to thank you all for contributing to the system
and hope you enjoyed and got something out of it.
With only 1 or 2 exceptions,  we've had a great bunch of users who took the
board for what it was supposed to be.  A place to go nuts about the Amiga and
have some fun.  I still love the Amiga,  I just don't have time to run a BBS
anymore.  In a year or 2,  who knows,  maybe you'll be logging onto The Amiga
Asylum II running on a 100mhz AMIGA 5000!!

                       Until then,
                        Take Care & God Bless

[Subject ] Amiga Asylum - Goodbye

   The only think I can say is that I think it's good that you realize that
you don't have the time to do something right, so you're not going to do it at
all. Arrakis BBS has been around for years on a C-128, and no one hardly knows
about it anymore ... let alone uses it. Yet, Paul keeps the thing on line.
It's like a dead thing that doesn't know it's time to die.

   Anyway, the board was at one point pretty interesting and for the most part
I had a good time. Maybe you'll take advantage of some of the other systems in
the community now that you won't have your own to call.

   Good luck. Farewell. Peace.
   -=* Elminster (Adam)

 I'm not sure what I'll be doing computer wise.  I may be getting into doing
some video work (Toaster etc.)  In any event,  I'm keeping my modem and I'll
probably pop up locally every once in awhile.

 think that this is the first amicable <sp> post I've ever seen
exchanged between the two of you. It's too bad now that A.A. is
going offline you two are finally agreeing on something in a
friendly way.

I have to sat that I'll miss calling A.A., even though the heated
debates died down about a year or so ago. It was still fun to call
now and then.

Tim, I wish you best of luck a success in whatever ventures you may
undertake. I'll probably give the "asylum" one last call this Friday.

I'm really disappointed that your taking the board down, I did only call once
a week, however, A.A. and the Necropolis are all I really call anymore, every

everything else is pretty bad. By the way, since I'm calling from his house,
Here's Ryan Bagueros to say a few words - I never gave him my account!

Hey nigga whatup? But seriously folks, I can't say that I have any kind of
feelings on the descent of the Amiga Asylum, since I was banned for saying a
bad word. (Kinda like if my high school burned down..) er sumthin. Anyway, 
just

just to let everyone know that dere ain't no hard feelings, you could give
this info to Gordon and Seth as long as they don't abuse it, and of course for
you too. The # for the Necropolis is 966-PILE and the NUP is 2164930719 ...
since Gordon, Seth, etc. won't have anywhere to call, maybe they could try 
to stand the smell and come over to the Necropolis. Anyways, see ya around 
and remember - jesus was a homosexual. well byebye.

ryan-poo


Would you get this info to Gordon and Seth because we had some interesting
little discussions and now, I don't know where else thay call.
