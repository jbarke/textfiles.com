INTRODUCTION
(11 issues of Success)

     Welcome to the pardon-us-as-we-sit-on-our-own-horn golden
11th issue of the Purple Thunderbolt of Spode, still Kenyon
College's ONLY non-alien run magazine.

     As you are probably well aware it is a long standing
tradition of periodicals that, upon reaching some landmark issue,
like the 50th or the 11th, to dedicate an unusually long
editorial to the kind of shameless self-back patting one usually
expects from senators and sports figures.  Well, we here at the
Purple Thunderbolt would hate to break a long standing tradition
but we are a little short on space, seeing as how we have lots of
stuff this week which is far more interesting than hearing me
talk.  So let me give a very BRIEF history of the magazine,
welcome our new members (of which there are several), and we'll
get on with it.

     As you all know, Purps was not always the great and glorious
enterprise you see before you today.  Started in a shoe box in a
back alley in the roughest section of DesMonies, Iowa almost 11
issues ago, by a rough an tumble bunch of neo-Jesuit Apocalyptic
nuns led by the now legendary Sister Mary Truman. The early
issues of Purps were marked by a long string of territorial knife
fights (where the good sister held her own), the infamous yak
tossing scandal, and Sister Mary's disappointing defeat in the
bid for the presidency (in 1989).  We pulled through, however,
despite the lawsuits lobbed against us by animal rights groups
(including the infamous International Yak Liberation Front, now
safely in the custody of the Tibetan authorities) by, in
retrospect, something just a little bit short of a divine miracle
struggling all the way until we finally achieved fame when we
became a fortune five hundred company after a very very very
small, tiny really, government financed bailout in late 1990. 
Today, of course, Purps remains the most well known of all the
popular taxidermy magazines in America with a virtual corner on
the huge "dentist office reading" market, and the favorite
electronic journal of several very well known dead people.

     We here at Purps are proud to have, just this week, made it
to the top of the FBI's most wanted list, proud to have been
able, just a few short issues ago to, with the help of you, our
beloved readers, have been able to make a small (and entirely tax
free) contribution to the Bay Area Doctor's brave Campaign for
the Prevention of Inherited Flatulence, proud of all of the
achievements of our staff of thousands (give or take) and proud,
very proud, to have been able to have faithfully served you, our
beloved readers, for almost 11 issues.  Thank you, and OTIS bless
you.

     (Excuse us while we wipe our tears off the terminal).

     Alright.  We have new members.  For them, welcome!  We have
also updated our distribution list; it will be appended at the
end of this article.  Memorize it to avoid the embarrassing
necessity of name tags when we're finally rounded up by the FBI
and stuck in a cell together.  Please remember the Pope's b-day
party, here, at Kenyon College, possibly in Ernst center,
possibly in Scott Simpson's half of his room in the New
Apartments.  We expect almost 40 people (almost being a highly
relative term, could be 80, could be four) and a wild time.  It's
on the 9th, in the evening.  ALL are invited.  If you can get
here somehow and want to come, e-mail to the address above for
directions.

_L.A. Police Chief Urges Shooting Casual Users_ 
 
        Washington - Casual drug users "ought to be taken out and
shot," the Los Angeles police chief, Daryl F. Gates, has told a
Senate hearing on the first anniversary of the Bush
administration's war on drugs. 
        Mr. Gates, discussing his comment to the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Wednesday, said his harsh assessment was aimed at 
those "who blast some pot on a casual basis" despite the
illegality of  the act, as opposed to hard-core addicts who are
driven by their physical need for illicit drugs. 
        Mr. Gates said in an interview outside the hearing that
he was not being facetious.  "We're in a war," he said, and even
casual drug use "is treason."

An Important Investment Tip

Lai See - South China Morning Post - 12 November 1990
        Lawyer David Gunson has discovered that investors should
go short on insurers between 1992 and 1994. This is when the
planets in the solar system will line up in order from the sun. 
It will be the first time in 25,000 years.
     "It may well be accompanied by gravitational stress on our
jolly little planet's tectonic plates," he said.

Some excerpts from Fortean Times #55 (Autumn 1990):

On 10 February 1989 the inhabitants of the tiny town of Fyffe in 
Alabama witnessed the return to earth of the late glittering pianist 
Liberace (double-size, 12 foot tall), who descended from a golden 
banana-shaped spacecraft via a moving stairway* and treated the 
lucky witnesses to a medley of Hollywood show-stoppers, with 
glowing fingers on a floating piano.  Talk of the apparition brought 
chaos to the town with 4,000 cars jamming the main street on 6 
March 1989.  An "American UFO expert" said: "Too many people have 
seen strange things for it to be a hoax."

An estimated 41,000 Parisians got a nasty shock through the post 
last year--a letter accusing the recipient of murder, extortion and 
organizing prostitution in the French capital.
   Embarrassed Justice Ministry officials explained that a computer 
had mixed up a list of suspects who had jumped bail with one 
containing the names of people guilty of minor parking violations.
   The good news for citizens who unexpectedly found themselves on 
a police "Most Wanted" list was a paragraph in each letter informing 
them of the penalty for their capital crime:  a small fine equivalent to 
that imposed on those issued with parking tickets.

 _Dead Reckoning_

        An excerpt from a research paper done on geriatric patients in Hong
Kong:
        "After one year, among the 141 patients studied in the first phase,
37 were dead.  The dead and the survived were compared in terms of various
aspects of functioning.  It was found that, in all five dimensions of
functioning, the dead were generally weaker.
        "The dead had poorer self-perceived economic conditions.  More of
 them thought that their economic resources were not adequate for them to
 make ends meet ..."
        "The dead also demonstrated a higher level of anxiety than the
survived as they found life dull and had more worries ... "
        "By and large, fewer dead patients had been able to perform
activities to maintain an independent household, e.g. moving around,
preparing meal, doing household work and washing light clothing.
        "Finally, the dead patients had fewer social contacts and more of
them were living alone than the survived."

Subj:  This is your brain on philosophy

Always thought that a child's mental processes must be a bit simple, yes,
perhaps that nothing too complicated could be going on in an unformed mind?
Well, check this out:
  "The child is viewed as using his primary linguistic data either
to decide among the candidate grammars that an innately represented
'General Linguistic Theory' enumerates or to 'calibrate' endogenous rule
schemas by fixing parameter values that the innate endowment leaves
unspecified.  This sort of story makes perfectly good sense so long as
what is innate is viewed as having propositional content:  as expressing
linguistic universals, or rule schemas, or whatever.  But it makes no sense
at all on the opposite assumption."
That's from _The_Modularity_of_Mind_ by Jerry Fodor, one of the books I'm
likely to be doing my comps on.  Whee.

After sleeping on the matter(after finally giving up on hearing some solid
answers as to whether Tel Aviv has been nerve-gassed) I have decided that I
really like the changes you have made.  They seem to be much more in tune
with the new computing situation at Kenyon, the tastes of the people at
Kenyon, and in general promises to keep things from getting stale.  You just

Oh, btw, there's a large Otis symbol in one of the men's stalls in Queens.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
 
> How can i learn to play the fluet? 
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
 
} The fluet is an instrument with a great tradition; it was played by 
} the anceint Egyptains, The Romasn and the Greeks. In its most primitve 
} form, it consists of a simlpe tbue of wood with several hoels cut 
} along its lenght. By blwoing in the topmots hoel, you can produce a 
} most Sepulchrla Toen, one which so characterizes teh wonderful fluet. 
} Finally, it is by rapid figner motiosn across the otehr hoels that you 
} are able to produec a Wied Vareity of Toens, each Supulchrla in nature 
} but which as a whoel also form a great Harmoyn. It is for thsi Harmoyn 
} that you strive.

    I just got my latest issue of the American Family Association Journal,
and noticed a couple of toll-free numbers listed for:

  Philip Morris, International... 1-800-421-1003... who supports
       Senator Jesse Helms quite amply, and...

  Procter & Gamble... 1-800-543-7276... who give thousands of pets

    I am sure that many of you dial 1-800 numbers regularly, and I just
wanted to warn you of these two so when the opportunity arises, you can
avoid their unnecessary expense of approximately $1 each time they answer
your call.

LAST WORD!

This Week, William Shattner

From a San Jose Mercury News "Sunday magazine" interview with William
Shatner: 
 
 ...The real kick about directing science fiction is that you can start from
a clean slate.  You can invent things to your heart's content and you don't
necessarily have to explain how it works. For example, in *Star Trek V* we
shot a scene -- it doesn't appear in the finished film; I don't know exactly
why we cut it -- where Kirk and Spock have to make a visit to the men's
room.  And the camera angle shows them from the waist up, a frontal view;
they're just standing there, several feet apart.  They don't fuss around
with their zippers or anything.  There are none of the sounds you associate
with a trip to the men's room; just Kirk and Spock looking slightly bored. 
After a half-minute or so they just walk away -- they're finished.  Well,
how did they complete their mission?  That's up to the audience to speculate

The "Golden 11th" issue of The Purple Thunderbolt of Spode owes nearly all
