INTRODUCTION
("I've got this hammer and you have your knee caps.  Well, I
guess we're all set, then."-- OTISian Preacher Tim Howland, from
his book "Gentle Persuasion")

     Like Christmas lights, department stores sales, mistle toe,
and columnist's calls for New Year's resolutions, this issue of
Purps is a little early this holiday season.  First of all, we're
deeply sorry (Hail Brow!), but we do have an explanation (Hail
Soap!).  I will be on vacation for three weeks starting around
the 20th and, hence (quite planned, trust me), I will be nowhere
near a terminal connected to the internet.  So, I thought I'd
give you all the X-Mass issue early.  Besides, we here a Kenyon
are right in the middle of an academic "crunch", and a little
levity might not be such a bad thing (HAIL Spode!).
     For those of you who are receiving this via Quartz or one of
our other numerous (and growing, Hail OTIS!) posting areas,
PLEASE notice the new address at the top of the issue.  Mail to
the old decnet address WILL NO LONGER GET THROUGH.  This is why
you haven't heard from me in a while.  It's not (only? :)) that I
hate you.
     A CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS!:  As I said in the last issue, Purps
would love submissions from you all for the golden 11th issue. 
I'd like a lot of "viewer mail" in this one.  Write and let us
know what you think of the 'zine.  Pro and con...

     LASTLY: EVERYONE READING THIS IS HEREBY FORMALLY INVITED TO
THE GREATEST OTISian CELEBRATION OF THE YEAR:  THE POPE'S B-DAY
PARTY!

     That's right, true believers, everybody reading this message
is now invited to an all out birthday bash for Pope Geoffe I of
the IGHF, expect an entire night of fun, frolic, and out in out
riotous OTISian celebration.  I can't tell you much more than
that since it's been a tradition of mine to let my friends
surprise me in the most interesting way possible (with *Athem*
certain limitations) on my B-Day; two years ago they blindfolded
me, led me around in the snow for 45 minutes listening to Monty
Python's "I Like Traffic Lights", and then presented me with my
official OTISian robes.  (Honest, Mom, they're the best friends a
guy could want).  However, expect an exceedingly good time, and
maybe a live band...

             WHEN: Sat. the 10th of Feb.
             
             WHERE: Kenyon College campus, Gambier, OH.

             WHERE!?!: Send me a message and I'll provide instructions.

If you come from a distance (i.e. you don't live here) we can put
you up (albeit on a dorm room floor), and probably give you a
meal ($2.30, all you can eat of the same food they give you on
airlines... what a bargain!.. if they catch you, otherwise
free...).

NO NEED FOR AN INVITE.  JUST BRING THE TERMINAL ON WHICH THIS
NOTE APPEARED!  PJ.

                  AND FOR A GOOD REASON!

(Well, three, actually...)

1.  IT DOESN'T DO MUCH.  Our technicians have spent many long
hours making EUNUCHS quite literally THE least complicated
operating system not yet on the market.  To do this they took a
perfectly good operating system developed by a rival firm and
deleted all of the complicated functions.  Then, they doubled the
price.  So DON'T waste your valuable time learning complex
commands you'll never use!  With EUNUCHS, they don't do anything,
anyway!  EUNUCHS is so simplified, in fact, that you'll be lucky
if you get it to do anything beyond printing out a simple
directory and showing a text file!  Don't muck around with
complex operating systems ever again!

2.  YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT ANYWAY!  (So who needs a complex
manual?)  One of the nicest features of EUNUCHS is that it takes
up very little space.  In fact, there's no need to abandon your
current operating system, EUNUCHS WILL FIT RIGHT ALONG SIDE IT
WITH NARRY A COMPLAINT!*  You'll hardly know it's there!  You'll
hardly give a d-mn, anyway!

3. Actually, there is no number three.  We screwed up.  Um...
sorry.  It won't um happen again.

E_U_N_U_C_H_S- only 1995959595.. umm... 95.

OTISIAN RANTS
---------------------------------------------------------------
(in which everything worth knowing about absolutely everything will be
revealed!)

This Week:  An OTISian X-Mass.

   My father gives joke gifts (slinky toys-- as opposed, I suppose to the
real thing; why DO they name them that?).  My grandmother gives Oxford
button-downs, PLAID OXford, button downs, mind you, and nothing else.  My
mother give me sweaters.  Lots of sweaters.  I have considered opening a
store (unfortunately my sources inform me that there is no great market
demand for yellow fisherman's this year).  My grandfather gives me whatever
Grandma buys while he's not looking, and, less often, a piece of fishing
equipment (not generally attached to a note asking if he could borrow it,
but there might as well be, you know?).  My sister usually aims better, but
often gives the same gift over and over for a number of years.  My Great-
Grandmother, of course, gives me a check worth $1.00 for every year old she
thinks I am.  For the past 12 years it has been equal to all of six dollars. 
But none of this is anywhere NEAR as bad as the traditional X-Mass
celebration with the god(esse)s.

   Picture, if you will, and even if you won't, this:

   Dec. 28th, 1989

   "So, do you like it?" OTIS asked, face buried in the very LARGE stocking
I'd stuffed and hung for him/her.

   "I'm not sure", I said cautiously, "If the electric eel goes well with the
hot tub."

   OTIS looked up.  "Spode!"

   There was a muted snicker from the room around the corner.

   "Sorry." said OTIS, "Um, SOMEHOW the tags got switched around.  Ah!" 
(S)he pulled a tag reading "From Spode" off a much smaller package and
handed it to me. "Here you go.  Open it."

   I tore carefully at the wrapping.

   "Socks." I said after a minute, and added "Thank you."

   "MATCHING socks" added OTIS knowingly.

   "Matching socks." I corrected myself.

   "Now" said OTIS, stuffing her/his face with a chocolate snack "You'll
never have that problem again."

   I considered explaining that one pair of matching socks didn't really
solve the problem, but then reconsidered.  "I suppose", I mumbled, "I could
always through away all the other ones..."

   "Attaboy!" whispered Lotus in my ear, slapping my back gently.  "Wouldn't
want to ruin his/er X-mas!"

   "My turn!" yelled Spode waltzing into the room. "Let's see, let's see...
ah! here we are!" he smiled brightly "'From Pope Geoffee I to Spode.'  Can't
wait to see what you got me."  

   He reduced the tissue paper to shreds.

   "A joy buzzer!  A GOLD-PLATED joy buzzer!"

   Brass, actually, but I didn't want to burst his bubble.

   "Thanks Geoffee I."

   On to him, I didn't take the hand.

   Spode grinned evilly.  "Gotta go find Rotus."  He was off in a flash.

   From the other room a few moments later, the sound of a buzzer, and of
furniture being thrown.

   "Probably," said Preacher Tim, coming in from the kitchen with a hot cup
of wassail, "not a wise thing to do to the God of death."

   "Hmmm." I said, "Did I ever tell you how happy I am that we celebrate this
little soire at your place?"

   Tim didn't hear.  "Someone", he said, "had better keep him away from
Brow."

   OTIS sighed heavily and rose from the couch.  "I'll get it back from him."
He paused for a moment at the door and turned "You have no idea how
difficult it is being both father and mother to these clowns."

   "Well, now, I guess it's just us!" Said Lotus as he rummaged through the
gifts, "Here!"

   He handed us each identical boxes.

   "Matching tuxes." I said.

   "Paisley tuxes", added Tim, and indeed they were, completely constructed
of red and god paisley fabric.

   "Like 'em?" Said Lotus grinning broadly.

   Tim paused.  "You gave everyone the same thing." 

   "Sure did." he said "Prevents fights.  No one gets jealous."

   "Ah, " I said.

Dear List Organizers and List Members:
        We would appreciate your sharing this seven-screen Announcement of
an Electronic Journal.  Thanks.

**** About _EJournal_, part 1; approximately 2 screens --
     
        _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, Bitnet/Internet distributed,
peer-reviewed, academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in
theory and praxis surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic text.  We are
also interested in the broader social, psychological, literary, economic
and pedagogical implications of computer-mediated networks.  Texts that
address virtually any subject across this broad spectrum will be given
thoughtful consideration.
        Members of the electronic-network community and others
interested in it make up a large portion of our audience.  Therefore we
would be interested (for example) in essays about whether or not anyone
should own a communication that has been shared electronically, about
the pragmatics of cataloguing and indexing electronic publications,
about net-based collaborative learning, about artful uses of hypertext,
about the challenges that distance learning may offer to residential
campuses, about the role of The Matrix in cultural history and Utopian
polemic, about digitally recorded aleatoric fiction, about the
significance of resemblances between the electronic matrix and neural
systems, . . .  and so forth.
        The journal's essays will be available free to Bitnet/Internet
addresses.  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive for use by academic
deans or other supervisors.  Individual essays, reviews, stories-- texts
--sent to us will be disseminated to subscribers as soon as they have
been through the editorial process, which will also be "paperless."  We
expect to offer access through libraries to our electronic Contents,
Abstracts, and Keywords, and to be indexed and abstracted in appropriate
places.
        _EJournal_ is now soliciting essays for possible publication.  We
will be happy to consider reviews, letters, and (eventually) annotations
that ought to accompany texts we have already published.  We would be
happy to add interested specialists and generalists to our panel of
consulting editors.
        Please send essays for review, and inquiries, to
                        ejournal@albnyvms.bitnet

From: eiverson@NMSU.EDU
Subject: [eiverson@nmsu.edu: Re: Skills for Broadcasters]

   I'd be interested in reading opinions on the following question:

   What are the most important skills for a person working at a public radio
   station to have?

The skills needed to work at a public radio station vary greatly from
individual to individual.  As such, there is no clear consensus on
which skills are most important.  However, the following skill
exercises have certainly worked for me:

(1) Learn to tell time.  Your days in rock music where you could just
say "it's the top of the hour" are over.  You need to actually tell
time.

(2) Repeat the phrase "I'm Martin Booksbann I'm Martin Booksbann" over
and over until you really believe it.  Try eventually working up to
mimicking William F Buckley or Jean Kirkpatrick.  (Actually the same
person!)

(3) Give an ongoing synopsis of your daily activities as if you were
summarizing the plot of "Tristan and Isolde."  You can be Tristan
and/or Isolde as circumstances warrent.  If friends become bored, you
are on the right track.

(4) Never ever use the word "dude" in public.

(5) Know the correct syllable count of such names as "Prokofiev"
"Scriabin" and "Rimsky-Korsakov" (1, 3, and 27 respectively) Also,
learn how to say "Gounod" and "Kunzel" without giggling.

If you follow these simple rules, you can be the public radio employee
you always dreamed to be.  Free mug upon completion of the course, and
a 10 dollar donation during pledge week!

From:   VAX001::CHADWICK     "Alfred Überhacker Makertail ('Squirrel')"  

      Chewing Gum and other Mating Habits of the High School Student 
      -------------------------------------------------------------- 
     I say "and other Mating Habits" because many habits of high school
students relate to mating.  Some behaviors of students, however, do not
relate to mating. They are believed instead to be food-gathering and
primitive social instincts. 

     For those who have not had the opportunity to engage in a close study
of high school students, I can give a few basic facts before going into an
in-depth study of the behaviors of which I am writing. 

     High school students are divided into four sub-species.  The freshman
is the lowest sub-species as far as development and intra-species status are
concerned.  Next on the developmental/status ladder is the sophomore, and
then the junior.  Highest of all is the senior. 

     These animals seem to thrive equally well in the wild or in captivity. 
This has led some courageous individuals to attempt restraint of them in
their captive state.  This restraint is currently impossible, as the high
school student is a notoriously determined being who dislikes any attempt to
curtail what they refer to as their "freedom".  Mixed rewards and
restrictions have been slightly more successful, some to the point of
getting a very few students to half-willingly enter captivity for the six
hours that has been deemed by wise men and women to be the longest amount of
time that the student can be kept out of the wild...while the student
thrives well in captivity for longer than such time, the environment in
which the student is placed fares rather less well. 

   Even in the wild, however, students are monitored by people, as otherwise
the students' behavior pattern would quickly lead to the destruction of the
world. 

     I now begin my study of specific student behaviors: 

                           Chewing Gum... 
    
 Although chewing gum is manufactured elsewhere now, it is my theory that it
was originally secreted naturally by the mouth of the student.  It is
certain that this process still goes on, and the high school student uses
the gum secretion to mark its territory.  It does so in a unique manner --
by sticking it to the undersides of flat surfaces.  In captivity, this can
lead to some sanitary problems with the undersides of tables. 

                             Noises... 
     Students in captivity have been observed to produce strange noises such
as "fug" and "sht" and "mthrfug" (believed to be an advanced form of "fug"). 
It is not certain whether these sounds are examples of communicative
behavior or normal involuntary noises made during the respiratory process. 

                              Smoke...
     Some students have been observed to breathe smoke from their mouths and
noses.  This has led certain learned observers to conclude that the student
is distantly related to the ancient species of dragon (now believed
extinct).  The blustering, showy behavior of the male student also tends to
support this theory. It is conjectured that in the male, the breathing of
smoke and blustery behavior are part of a "mating show" designed to attract
the female student.  If this is the case, then the breathing of smoke by the
female student may well support the hypothesis that smoke is mutually
sexually attractive to students.  Research is still being conducted.

Yesterday,in conversation, discussion was made as to future generations
using in everyday language the term Milli-Vanilli hence my addition to the
1991 edition of Webster's:

Mil-li-Va-nil-i (Slang 1990) 1.v.To take authorized credit for someone's
work, and displaying an attitude and image as if it was well earned and 
deserved(i.e. That professor Milli-Vanillied my thesis.)
2.n. A person or group that acts like, says that it is, and defends 
itself of the truth only to be revealed as a front to bunch of idiotic
and artless neer dowells.

Subj:   The horrors of baking


Did you know?

                      EVERY TIME A LOAF OF BREAD
                              IS BAKED,
                            APPROXIMATELY
                        150,000,000 YEASTS ARE
                                KILLED.

                 Come to the award-winning 1987 film,
                  "The Very Small and Quiet Screams"
        -- a cinematic electromicrograph of yeasts being baked.

Subj:   and you thought an after dinner chat at Mt. Olympus was confusing.

Well here you go. More or less raw though I edited out all my 
private cross talk since that will only confuse matters more. I 
suppose you should just pick out the good parts if there are any. I 
just send you all if it in case you wanted it. This is not made up 
these are indeed real folks on relay. Other people I don't know or don't
recall or any of that business. Probably you shouldn't print who these
people are. I don't know how people take kindly to having their convos
intercepted and published.

<mal> Pich: I have nightmares about them. 
<Kang> pich mal containing BILLIONS and BILLIONS 
<Kang> of shoe stores 
<A----> Mal: The shopping mall being the fundamental 
<A----> particle of gaudiness   
<Kang> pich well he could have helped when the 
<Kang> martians took santa 
<A-----> Mall--that most fundamental particle, having 
<A-----> the properties of volume and parking space, 
<A----> and gaudiness, 
<A----> but no intelligence or substance whatsoever...

LAST WORD!

Quote for the day:  "Utinam barabari spatium proprium tuum invadant!"
  (May barbarians invade your personal space.)

Should be a way to pervert this to Otis' cause...Utinam Otisiani, perhaps?

[BEHOLD THE NEW OTISian PHRASE:  Utinam OTISiani spatium proprium tuum
invadant!-- May OTIS invade your personal space!... or, if you prefer
"Utinam Brow rosum gardum proprium tuum visitant!-- May Brow appear and stay
in your rose garden!
