CALIFORNIA -- THE SACRAMENTO group that puts out "Alphabet Threat"
is making plans to open a community center, as are some activists
in the Long Beach/Los Angeles area.... The SouthernCal Anarchist
Gathering drew a crowd of over four-hundred December 4-6, 1992.
New Food Not Bombs!  (FNB!) chapters have sprung up in Long Beach
and Los Angeles.... Some Long Beach anarchists were ticketed for
wheat-pasting anti-cop flyers - to the tune of $700! The city
dropped the fine, however, when threatened with a civil liberties
suit. Hooray! ... An Anarchist Hotline for the Bay Area is (510)
273 2449.

PORTLAND, OREGON -- ROSEBUD Commons Resource Collective, a
community center extrordinare, has opened in the Albina
neighborhood. Several groups are based at the center, including
Anti-Racist-Action, FNB!, and BEIRUT USA (an anti-government
group). Live Wild Or Die is now being produced and printed from
this anarchist space. Those at the Commons are committed to
building community in the marginalized and most heavily-policed
neighborhoods of Portland. Rosebud Commons is named in memory of
activist Rosebud Denovo. [See Love and Rage Vol. 3, No. 7] ...

Also active in Portland: Scavenger and Crux Presses, Haymarket
Media Project, Jones' Planet Music Collective, Albina Open Jam
Collective, Fuzzbane, Anarchist Black Cross (ABC), Albina Earth

and international news, interviews, and videos. The program also

revolution and more! It's fun for the whole family! KYT, produced

               RESOURCES FOR ANTI-RACIST ACTIVISTS

                        by Christopher Day

THE FOLLOWING GROUPS AND resources represent a broad spectrum of
political perspectives within the anti-racist and anti-fascist
movement. Some groups are centrist, some are liberal, some are
communists, and some are coalitions of different tendencies. I
believe that anti-fascist work can only succeed if it is carried
out in a non-sectarian fasion. That doesn't mean that anarchists
should abandon our commitment to militancy, but rather that we
should try to develop good relations with groups we may have
differences with because there will be times when we can work
together, and we can't afford to go it alone against this rising
menace. Every serious anti-racist should at least make initial
contact with all of these groups. Let them know what you are doing
(keeping in mind security questions, particularly with groups that
deal with the cops) and find out what they are doing.

Center for Democratic Renewal
PO Box 50469
Atlanta GA 30302-0469
tel (404) 221 0025

CDR is probably the best source of up to date information on the
racist right in the US. They provide educational speakers, publish
a number of valuable pamphlets, and have produced a very good
organizing kit "When Hate Groups Come to Town". CDR's strength is
their information on the more established racist right (the Klan,
Aryan Nations, and older Nazis). They are not as in touch with the
racist skinhead scene, but want to be. For this reason, they are
relatively friendly to more militant anti-racist groups that have
good information or do solid work around skinheads. While they
encourage groups to develop contacts with local police forces for
strategic reasons, they are not naive about the cops. Their
intelligence on the racist right is the best available.  They
publish "The Monitor". 

DCSCAR 
PO Box 18291
Washington DC 20036
tel (202) 529 5037

The DC Student Coalition Against Apartheid and Racism came
together during the upsurge of student anti-apartheid activism in
1985.  They have continued to do anti-racist work and remain one
of the more vibrant student and youth based anti-racist groups.
They publish "SCAR NEWS".

Coalition for Human Dignity
PO Box 40344
Portland, OR 97240

CHD came together around the rising tide of racist activity in
Oregon, which includes both a significant racist skinhead scene
and the more rural Christian Identity churches associated with the
Aryan Nations. They mobilized around the civil suit against Tom
Metzger and the White Aryan Resistance waged by Morris Dees of the
Southern Poverty Law Center. They are affiliated with CDR and most
recently focused their work on opposing the Anti-Queer ballot
Measure 9 in Oregon.


Louisiana Coalition 
Against Racism and Nazism
234 Loyola Ave. Suite 915
New Orleans, LA 70112
tel (504) 523 2811

LCARN came together when David Duke first ran for the Louisiana
State Legislature in 1989. They were the main group to organize
against his failed bid for the Governor's office in 1991. They did
excellent work in exposing Duke's efforts to present himself as a
reformed Klansman and are the best source of information on Duke
and his wing of the racist right.

People Against Racist Terror
PO Box 1990
Burbank, CA 91507

PART is a small collective that publishes a very good anti-racist
newsletter, that is itself an excellent place to find resources.
Their letters page is a lively forum for younger anti-racist's
grappling with the difficult questions that confront anti-racist
organizing. They have organized confrontations with racist groups
in Southern California as well cultural events (Hardcore and Hip
Hop shows).

John Brown Anti-Klan Committee
220 9th St., Suite 443
San Francisco CA 94103
tel (415)330 5360

JBAKC is a militant white anti-racist group that is closely tied
to the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee, a Marxist
anti-imperialist group.  They have been very supportive of
anti-racist skinhead organizing efforts and more militant
approaches to confronting the racist right. They publish a
newsletter, "No KKK No Fascist USA", irregularly.

Race Traitor
PO Box 603
Cambridge, MA 02140 

"Race Traitor" is a new journal subtitled Treason to whiteness is
loyalty to humanity. They are seeking to become the voice of a
community of people of European descent who want to abolish the
white race as a historically constructed social formation. This is
vital intellectual ammunition for those of us trying to make sense
of doing anti-racist work among white people. The first issue was
128 pages and costs $5.

Klanwatch/Southern Poverty Law Center
400 Washington Ave.
Montgomery, AL 36104

The Southern Poverty Law Center is best known for their legal
battles against white supremacist groups. Their most recent
victory was against Tom Metzger's White Aryan Resistance. The Law
Center brings civil suits against groups that incite racist crimes
and thereby seeks to financially damage those groups. They also
produce some excellent literature on the Klan that should be of
use to everybody.

Searchlight
37B New Cavendish Street
London WIM 8JR  UK

"Searchlight", a monthly magazine, is probably the best source of
information in English on fascism as an international movement.
They have coverage of groups in North America, but are best known
for their European coverage. Politically they are close to the
Center for Democratic Renewal. One blemish on their record has
been some unfounded attacks on Class War and other anarchists.

Anti-Fascist Action/Fighting Words
BM Box 1734
London WC1N 3XX  UK

AFA is a militant anti-fascist organization in England that
includes many revolutionary anti-authoritarians. Their
publication, "Fighting Words", is useful as a window on what a
serious fighting anti-fascist movement might look like. It doesn't
have much intelligence info that is of use to North Americans, but
it is an inspiration to read the lively and intelligent
discussions of people who are really in the street taking on the
racist right.

Blood in the Face by James Ridgeway
Thunder's Mouth Press

For $18.95 this book is probably the most comprehensive overview
of the racist right in the US that is generally available.
Ridgeway is a reporter for the "Village Voice", and he did his
homework for this one. This book is absolutely crucial to
understanding the ins and outs of the racist right. Buy it
immediately. If you can't find it in a bookstore you can get it
from CDR.

Canadian Center on Racism and Prejudice
Box 505  Station Desjardins
Montreal PQ H5B 1B6  Canada
tel (514) 727 2936

The CCRP is basically the Canadian version of the Center for
Democratic Renewal. The organization was founded in the late 1980s
by French-speaking Qué becois in response to the growth of the
Klan (yes, the Klan), and right-wing strains of Quebecois
nationalism in Quebec.  They have since broadened their work to
include all of Canada.

Anti-Defamation League
823 UN Plaza
New York, NY 10017
tel (212) 490 2525

It is with great reluctance that I even include this outfit on a
list of anti-fascist resources. The ADL routinely classifies
solidarity actions with the Palestinian liberation struggle as
anti-Semitic and lumps them in with Nazi attacks on synagogues.
They have published scurrilous attacks on anti-fascist groups that
oppose their Zionism. They work very closely with the police and
should not be trusted with any information you don't want the cops
to see. What they are good for is information on actual fascist
groups, particularly neo-nazi and specifically anti-Semitic
groups.  They publish regular reports and it is worth getting on
their mailing list.


Political Research Associates
678 Massachusetts Ave. Suite 205
Cambridge MA 02139
tel (617) 661 9313

PRA produces reports on the activities of the far-right. One piece
by Russ Bellant analyzing the role of fascists in the Reagan
administration and the Republican Party is particularly useful.
More recently Chip Berlet has sought to expose the cult-like New
Alliance Party and the inroads of the racist right among
conspiracy-minded progressives, like the Christic Institute. PRA
is basically liberal in its outlook, but their research work is
very good.
