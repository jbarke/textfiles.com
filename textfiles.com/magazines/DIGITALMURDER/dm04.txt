     Technysis didn't pay his bill so the line is disconnected.  Technysis
     says that the board WILL be going back up in the near future and will
     be ran on his new IBM.  Several of us here at DM are currently under
     investigation by the FBI.  Bell Labs has been mentioned by several
     feds and I'm sure it's being monitored somehow.  I won't be calling
     it again anytime soon because I'm in enough shit already.  If you
     want to take your chances, look through previous issues of DM and get

     My apologies to everyone for this issue missing a few things but it
     is beyond our control.  You'll notice no H/P type stuff in this issue

     this scene (and a few that have been busted from this) but I haven't
     compiled the information for publication.  ..should be a good read.


     WHY SO LATE?
     ------------

     As you can see, Digital Murder #4 is a few days late.  This delay was
     caused by ANOTHER strange system crash.  It seems that everytime I take
     my computer apart for cleaning it tries to stay in the lowest energy
     state and completely refuses to come back from the dead.  However, the
     problem was solved by disassembling my computer and placing it inside
     a pyramidical shape where the energy levels of the pyramid's interior
     reflexed with the silicon chips basic atom structure.  The energy fields
     of the silicon (sand) electromagnetically bonded with the fields within
     the pyramid, quickly bringing the machine back to life.

     Other less cosmic things have kept the magazine on hold as well such as
     a very beautiful female acquaintance, free visits to local clubs around
     the city, a hopeful new job at the coolest 'head shop' in town (they have
     the best stuph around), and my continued affiliation with the finest of
     our city's underground subculture.  Since Digital Murder is
     coming out on time every other issue, we will have #5 out on time.  It's
     a nice concept indeed.  We like to give our readers time to recooperate
     from our magazine and any other subverse hobbies now and then.  So by
     the time you sober up or come down off of that crystal meth you've been
     eating for breakfast, Digital Murder will be there for your reading 
     pleasure.   Enjoy this and future issues. . .  


     XMASCON
     -------

     Here comes my secretary hump.  I'm gonna cram my dick up her  rump.
     Then I'm gonna open her..  hey..  Okay, Just listening to some  old
     Mentors I found digging through a dusty collection of cassettes but
     it somehow inspired me to write my part about XMASCON.  You'll find
     more info from the others I went to the conference with (Technysis,
     Chizz, and Acid Rocker) later in the mag.  They cover what all went
     down well but I'd like to mention just a few things about it before
     I loose this great inspirational writing moment.

     Friday morning we pulled into the glorious airport Hilton in Houston
     (where the maids 'no speak english') in out XMASCON OR BUST truck of
     doom (meaning it busted after we got there).  The first group of ppl
     we met were a few local loozers of the greater  Houston  area.  They
     followed us to our room and did their little k-rad speeches  telling
     us basically who they are, all the great h/p things they've done,  &
     generally showed us just how lame they were.  A few minutes later, 2
     dudes that looked similar to Laurel & Hardy meets the Cleavers  came
     into our room freaking out about how Bruce Sterling and the guys  of
     PHRACK magazine were a few doors down.  Well we headed down the hall
     with this group of loozers behind us (making me feel  really  pissed
     cause I was trying to ditch these geeks) and went in  to  meet  some
     people besides the geeks with the IQ of plants.  At around 11:00  am
     my beer arrived so I started on that gig.  The remainder  of  Friday
     consisted of drinking and hanging out talking (but mostly drinking).

     It was kind of interesting how easy it was to tell the ''geeks from
     the phreaks'' because all the local geeks looked like moma's boys and
     the ''phreaks'' looked just as that:  Phreaks; those that were there
     to discuss computer security and such but looked like a bunch of punk
     rockers and ''devil worshippers (a common comment made by ignorant ppl
     about 'alternative' people)'' looking for drugs.  I seemed to fit in
     comfortably since I look like your average punker and I was indeed in
     search of both.

     Saturday arrived and things were a little more formal.  The conference
     started around 2:00 pm and lasted till around 7:00 pm.  Those that spoke
     were:  DrunkFux, Crimson Death and Dispater of PHRACK, Bruce Sterling
     (author of the fabulous Difference Engine), Count Zero of CDC, a very
     interesting guy from WORLDVIEW who spoke from a techno-hippie 
     perspective, two guys from INFOMATIK, and the guys at Comsec.  After
     all the speeches we over with, we opened our minds to interesting vid's
     such as Geraldo Rivera's comical episode ''Now it can be told''and the
     video of the CDC in the MIT tunnels.

     As I said before, The conference will be covered in more detail later
     in this issue by Chizz, Technysis, and Acid Rocker but here are a few
     of the more interesting things I remember:

     o  The VooDoo Dudes under the LA bridges.

     o  Our XMASCON OR BUST truck.

     o  Meeting the people I've been reading about for years.

     o  The 'No Speak English' maids in the Hilton.

     o  Watching interesting videos in the Subgenious cult room.

     o  Watching the loozers be loozers.

     o  Crimson Death's interesting conversation on the Occult.

     o  Smokin' herb w/ Crimson Death and others.

     o  Getting drunk with everyone.

     o  Technysis puking in our floor after drinking lots of Mexican Flags.

     o  ''Vicious Butt'' 

     o  My sporadic invention:  Marshmellow Hex (see CDC 200).

     o  Helping write the DEMON SEED legacy (see CDC 200).

     o  Doc Cipher's stories and great impression of Clifford STOOGE.

     o  Someone mentioning a burning bible in the parking lot.

     o  The Hilton's security gaurd.

     o  The strippers (aka Cybersluts).

     o  CyberWASTE! and Monster Trucks.

     o  Jamming to Swap Rat of CDC's band.

     o  Doing lotsa n2o w/ CDC.

     o  Riding with ''crash'', the Hilton's bus driver.


     FINAL BITS AND PONDERINGS
     -------------------------

     Since most of you loozers don't live anywhere near Memphis, Chizz had
     a great idea to print a few interesting notes that may  interest  the
     avid computer hacker/phone phreak from one of  Memphis'  finest  news
     weekly's, The Memphis Flyer.

     NEWS of the WEIRD by: Chuck Shepherd  (from the Memphis Flyer)

       o  Federal Computer Week reported that software originally composed
          by the federal government to gauge the ''structural response  of
          bombs'' has passed into the public domain and is now being used
          by Coors Brewing Co. to calculate the force required by a poptop
          to open the can.

       o  In Tampa, Florida, in July, Michael Riley  asked  a  16-year-old
          girl several times when she wouold be finished with her call  at
          a payphone.  Finally exasperated, the  girl  grabbed  a  bottle,
          broke it at the neck, and slashed Riley three times on the  arm.
          Riley clutched his wound and calmly responded, '' Now we have an
          assault here, '' whereupon the girl grabbed the bottle again and
          stabbed him in the stomach.  When the police arrived,  the  girl
          was still talking on the phone.  <<Now that's a phone phreak!!>>


     Here is a final added treat before we get to the brain quenching 
     information of Digital Murder #4.  I had the pleasure to receive
     the following email on Technysis' board, The Backdoor.  I am sure
     reading this will take you back in time to the 'old days' when you
     were a sysop (and possibly remind you of the days when you were as
     lame as this guy!?!?!?).  I have edited out a few things since I am
     not as cruel as I should be.  The alias, however, is the one he used.

              :  Date:  Feb 4, 1992
--------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the kind words about our magazine and our movement.  Although some 
of the writers for the magazine tend to lean towards a totally anarchistic 
society, my personal views are slightly different.  I beleive that there is a 
cultural, domestic revolution waiting to happen which will reclamate the social
and economic structure of this country.  I encourage all our readers to learn
more about 'the terror of truth' in this nation and get involved.  In future
issues of Digital Murder you will see more of what I speak about and hopefully
will reiterate these ideas in social confrontations whenever possible.  The
main thing is edification but our theories do go far beyond to promote
awareness and a stronger mentality.  You will learn more about InFOWOrd in time
as we initiate production and distribution of our literature. 

Until then, keep your mind free and clean (but not washed!).

Morpheus for INFOWORD and Digital Murder magazine.

 In early November I heard Krs-1 (Chris Parker) lecture.  You may or may not
 be surprised, but he had some very good things to say.  During the lecture
 he pointed out many of the problems in our society and government today.  In
 the question and answer segment, I asked  what actions he believed should be
 taken.  I liked his answer which was ''organized revolution- not to achieve
 total Anarchy, not to topple our government and leave nothing in its place
 but I believe we should purge our government of politicians, and replace
 them with leaders.''
 
 Right now, we live in a society that has vast amounts of data basically at
 every person's fingertips.  I believe that there is NOTHING that cannot be
 learned and NO information that can be hidden from those who are TRULY
 dedicated to seeking the truth.  I also believe this won't last long...  As
 our technology grows, so does our knowledge of how to manipulate, and PROTECT
 it.  I believe if we don't act SOON it may be too late.  What I have said is
 based on my personal beliefs, and unfortunately, not enough from experience.

                              Take it easy,

I am new to this field, but I have worked for the TelCo for about 4 years until
I lost my speech, and they fired me. I have been looking all over for a BBS of
this nature in order to get back at AT&T, I would be glad to give you any
information to help you destroy AT&T.
I got this number from a former fellow associate at the TelCo in security (My
department) who had this number on bill evasion.
I still have limited access to their computers, but not enough to do any damage
to them.
I am now suing AT&T on grounds of discrimination, but it does not look like I
will get anything out of them for my job (They fired me after I had my larnyx
broken on an ATV)

 I have read issues 1-3 and must say I am impressed.  I eagerly await the next
 issue!  It seems that this 'zine and others like it are one of the few ways to
 see a bit of idealistic color in an otherwise drab and dreary society.  Keep
 up the good work.

Dudez!

Your magazine rockz!!  You guys seem to be the few real cyberpunk activists
out there among the many.  There are so many posers out there and I'm glad
to see a few that aren't.  

Morpheus.  You remind me of someone I know... into everything..from knowing
the truth and being firm in your beliefs as well as being into other cool
social shit.

As for Neuron God and Chizz.. you both know your shit!  Write more stuph
similar to what was in #3!

Zapped.. I admire your persistance in scanning the 'old fashioned phreaker
way' by hand but I think your article 'Scan 'o' de Month' is kinda lame.  I
hope all the DM staff doesn't get pissed but I think you should release your
scans seperate from the magazine.

Technysis:  I was glad to see that info on the roadrunner system.  I've found
stuff about it but you cleared a few thingz up.  A few of us around here in
my area still remember that crazy "letter to Bell" in issue 1.  Very trippin'.

     'nuff for now...      Digitek!

---------------------------------------
 
Well thanks for the comments, suggestions, etc..  I have a letter that totally
went off on the magazine and called us loozers, etc.. but I can't find it.  I
guess it'll be in #5.      Press FnORdWORD.

THE BATTLE FOR YOUR MIND, by Dick Sutphen 
Persuasion & Brainwashing Techniques Being Used On The Public Today


SUMMARY OF CONTENTS

The Birth of Conversion/Brainwashing in Christian Revivalism in 1735. The
Pavlovian explanation of the three brain phases. Born-again preachers:
Step-by-Step, how they conduct a revival and the expected physiological
results. The "voice roll" technique used by preachers, lawyers and hypnotists.
New trance-inducing churches. The 6 steps to conversion. The decognition
process. Thought-stopping techniques. The "sell it by zealot" technique. True
believers and mass movements. Persuasion techniques: "Yes set," "Imbedded
Commands," "Shock and Confusion," and the "Interspersal Technique."
Subliminals. Vibrato and ELF waves. Inducing trance with vibrational sound.
Even professional observers will be "possessed" at charismatic gatherings. The
"only hope" technique to attend and not be converted. Non-detectable
Neurophone programming through the skin. The medium for mass take-over.

    I'm Dick Sutphen and this tape is a studio-recorded, expanded version of a
talk I delivered at the World Congress of Professional Hypnotists Convention
in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although the tape carries a copyright to protect it from
unlawful duplication for sale by other companies, in this case, I invite
individuals to make copies and give them to friends or anyone in a position to
communicate this information.

    Although I've been interviewed about the subject on many local and
regional radio and TV talk shows, large-scale mass communication appears to be
blocked, since it could result in suspicion or investigation of the very media
presenting it or the sponsors that support the media. Some government agencies
do not want this information generally known. Nor do the Born-Again Christian
movement, cults, and many human-potential trainings.

    Everything I will relate only exposes the surface of the problem. I don't
know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped. I don't think it is
possible to legislate against that which often cannot be detected; and if
those who legislate are using these techniques, there is little hope of
affecting laws to govern usage. I do know that the first step to initiate
change is to generate interest. In this case, that will probably only result
from an underground effort.

    In talking about this subject, I am talking about my own business. I know
it, and I know how effective it can be. I produce hypnosis and subliminal
tapes and, in some of my seminars, I use conversion tactics to assist
participants to become independent and self-sufficient. But, anytime I use
these techniques, I point out that I am using them, and those attending have a
choice to participate or not. They also know what the desired result of
participation will be.

    So, to begin, I want to state the most basic of all facts about
brainwashing: IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF MAN, NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED
AND REALIZED, OR BELIEVED, THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED. Those who have been
brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators, claiming they
have simply been "shown the light"  . . . or have been transformed in
miraculous ways.

The Birth of Conversion

   CONVERSION is a "nice" word for BRAINWASHING . . . and any study of
brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in eighteenth
century America. Apparently, Jonathan Edwards accidentally discovered the
techniques during a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton, Massachusetts.
By inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension, the
"sinners" attending his revival meetings would break down and completely
submit. Technically, what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe
the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts new programming. The problem
was that the new input was negative. He would tell them, "You're a sinner!
You're destined for hell!"

    As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide.
And the neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they, too, were
affected so deeply that, although they had found "eternal salvation," they
were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to end their own lives.

    Once a preacher, cult leader, manipulator or authority figure creates the
brain phase to wipe the brain-slate clean, his subjects are wide open. New
input, in the form of suggestion, can be substituted for their previous ideas.
Because Edwards didn't turn his message positive until the end of the revival,
many accepted the negative suggestions and acted, or desired to act, upon
them.

    Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same
techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York. The
techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists, cults,
human-potential trainings, some business rallies, and the United States Armed
Services . . . to name just a few.

    Let me point out here that I don't think most revivalist preachers realize
or know they are using brainwashing techniques. Edwards simply stumbled upon a
technique that really worked, and others copied it and have continued to copy
it for over two hundred years. And the more sophisticated our knowledge and
technology become, the more effective the conversion. I feel strongly that
this is one of the major reasons for the increasing rise in Christian
fundamentalism, especially the televised variety, while most of the orthodox
religions are declining.

The Three Brain Phases

    The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate
brainwashing, but we have to look to Pavlov, the Russian scientist, for a
technical explanation. In the early 1900s, his work with animals opened the
door to further investigations with humans. After the revolution in Russia,
Lenin was quick to see the potential of applying Pavlov's research to his own
ends.

    Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were
identified by Pavlov. The first is the EQUIVALENT phase, in which the brain
gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli. The second is the
PARADOXICAL phase, in which the brain responds more actively to weak stimuli
than to strong. And the third is the ULTRA-PARADOXICAL phase, in which
conditioned responses and behavior patterns turn from positive to negative or
from negative to positive.

    With the progression through each phase, the degree of conversion becomes
more effective and complete. The way to achieve conversion are many and
varied, but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing is to
work on the emotions of an individual or group until they reach an abnormal
level of anger, fear, exitement, or nervous tension.

    The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgement and
increase suggestibility. The more this condition can be maintained or
intensified, the more it compounds. Once catharsis, or the first brain phase,
is reached, the complete mental takeover becomes easier. Existing mental
programming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and behavior.

    Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain functions
are fasting, radical or high sugar diets, physical discomforts, regulation of
breathing, mantra chanting in meditation, the disclosure of awesome mysteries,
special lighting and sound effects, programmed response to incense, or
intoxicating drugs.

    The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment by
electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a person's blood
sugar level with insulin injections.

    Before I talk about exactly how some of the techniques are applied, I want
to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two distinctly different
things--and that conversion techniques are far more powerful. However, the two
are often mixed . . . with powerful results.

How Revivalist Preachers Work

    If you'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work, there are probably
several in your city. Go to the church or tent early and sit in the rear,
about three-quarters of the way back. Most likely repetitive music will be
played while the people come in for the service. A repetitive beat, ideally
ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute (a rhythm close to the beat of the
human heart), is very hypnotic and can generate an eyes-open altered state of
consciousness in a very high percentage of people. And, once you are in an
alpha state, you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in full
beta consciousness. The music is probably the same for every service, or
incorporates the same beat, and many of the people will go into an altered
state almost immediately upon entering the sanctuary. Subconsciously, they
recall their state of mind from previous services and respond according to the
post-hypnotic programming.

    Watch the people waiting for the service to begin. Many will exhibit
external signs of trance--body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes. Often,
they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air while sitting in
their chairs. Next, the assistant pastor will probably come out. He usually
speaks with a pretty good "voice roll."

Voice Roll Technique

    A "voice roll" is a patterned, paced style used by hypnotists when
inducing a trance. It is also used by many lawyers, several of whom are highly
trained hypnotists, when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds
of the jurors. A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the
beat of a metronome or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word
in a monotonous, patterned style. The words will usually be delivered at the
rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute, maximizing the hypnotic effect.

    Now the assistant pastor begins the "build-up" process. He induces an
altered state of consciousness and/or begins to generate the excitement and
the expectations of the audience. Next, a group of young women in "sweet and
pure" chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song. Gospel songs are great
for building excitement and INVOLVEMENT. In the middle of the song, one of the
girls might be "smitten by the spirit" and fall down or react as if possessed
by the Holy Spirit. This very effectively increases the intensity in the room.
At this point, hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed. And the result
is the audience's attention span is now totally focused upon the communication
while the environment becomes more exciting or tense.

    Right about this time, when an eyes-open mass-induced alpha mental state
has been achieved, they will usually pass the collection plate or basket. In
the background, a 45-beat-per-minute voice roll from the assistant preacher
might exhort, "Give to God . . . Give to God . . . Give to God . . ." And the
audience does give. God may not get the money, but his already wealthy
representative will.

    Next, the fire-and-brimstone preacher will come out. He induces fear and
increases the tension by talking about "the devil," "going to hell," or the
forthcoming Armegeddon.

    In the last such rally I attended, the preacher talked about the blood
that would soon be running out of every faucet in the land. He was also
obsessed with a "bloody axe of God," which everyone had seen hanging above the
pulpit the previous week. I have no doubt that everyone saw it--the power of
suggestion given to hundreds of people in hypnosis assures that at least 10 to
25 percent would see whatever he suggested they see.

    In most revivalist gatherings, "testifying" or "witnessing" usually
follows the fear-based sermon. People from the audience come up on stage and
relate their stories. "I was crippled and now I can walk!" "I had arthritis
and now it's gone!" It is a psychological manipulation that works. After
listening to numerous case histories of miraculous healings, the average guy
in the audience with a minor problem is sure he can be healed. The room is
charged with fear, guilt, intense excitement, and expectations.

    Now those who want to be healed are frequently lined up around the edge of
the room, or they are told to come down to the front. The preacher might touch
them on the head firmly and scream, "Be healed!" This releases the psychic
energy and, for many, catharsis results. Catharsis is a purging of repressed
emotions. Individuals might cry, fall down or even go into spasms. And if
catharsis is effected, they stand a chance of being healed. In catharsis (one
of the three brain phases mentioned earlier), the brain-slate is temporarily
wiped clean and the new suggestion is accepted.

    For some, the healing may be permanent. For many, it will last four days
to a week, which is, incidentally, how long a hypnotic suggestion given to a
somnambulistic subject will usually last. Even if the healing doesn't last, if
they come back every week, the power of suggestion may continually override
the problem . . . or sometimes, sadly, it can mask a physical problem which
could prove to be very detrimental to the individual in the long run.

    I'm not saying that legitimate healings do not take place. They do. Maybe
the individual was ready to let go of the negativity that caused the problem
in the first place; maybe it was the work of God. Yet I contend that it can be
explained with existing knowledge of brain/mind function.

    The techniques and staging will vary from church to church. Many use
"speaking in tongues" to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle
creates intense excitement in the observers.

    The use of hypnotic techniques by religions is sophisticated, and
professionals are assuring that they become even more effective. A man in Los
Angeles is designing, building, and reworking a lot of churches around the
country. He tells ministers what they need and how to use it. This man's track
record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income will double if
the minister follows his instructions. He admits that about 80 percent of his
efforts are in the sound system and lighting.

    Powerful sound and the proper use of lighting are of primary importance in
inducing an altered state of consciousnes--I've been using them for years in
my own seminars. However, my participants are fully aware of the process and
what they can expect as a result of their participation.

Six Conversion Techniques

    Cults and human-potential organizations are always looking for new
converts. To attain them, they must also create a brain-phase. And they often
need to do it within a short space of time--a weekend, or maybe even a day.
The following are the six primary techniques used to generate the conversion.

    The meeting or training takes place in an area where participants are cut
off from the outside world. This may be any place: a private home, a remote or
rural setting, or even a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed
only limited bathroom usage. In human-potential trainings, the controllers
will give a lengthy talk about the importance of "keeping agreements" in life.
The participants are told that if they don't keep agreements, their life will
never work. It's a good idea to keep agreements, but the controllers are
subverting a positive human value for selfish purposes. The participants vow
to themselves and their trainer that they will keep their agreements. Anyone
who does not will be intimidated into agreement or forced to leave. The next
step is to agree to complete training, thus assuring a high percentage of
conversions for the organizations. They will USUALLY have to agree not to take
drugs, smoke, and sometimes not to eat . . . or they are given such short meal
breaks that it creates tension. The real reason for the agreements is to alter
internal chemistry, which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a
slight malfunction of the nervous system, which in turn increases the
conversion potential.

    Before the gathering is complete, the agreements will be used to ensure
that the new converts go out and find new participants. They are intimidated
into agreeing to do so before they leave. Since the importance of keeping
agreements is so high on their priority list, the converts will twist the arms
of everyone they know, attempting to talk them into attending a free
introductory session offered at a future date by the organization. The new
converts are zealots. In fact, the inside term for merchandising the largest
and most successful human-potential training is, "sell it by zealot!"

    At least a million people are graduates and a good percentage have been
left with a mental activation button that assures their future loyalty and
assistance if the guru figure or organization calls. Think about the potential
political implications of hundreds of thousands of zealots programmed to
campaign for their guru.

    Be wary of an organization of this type that offers follow-up sessions
after the seminar. Follow-up sessions might be weekly meetings or inexpensive
seminars given on a regular basis which the organization will attempt to talk
you into taking--or any regularly scheduled event used to maintain control. As
the early Christian revivalists found, long-term control is dependent upon a
good follow-up system.

    Alright. Now, let's look at the second tip-off that indicates conversion
tactics are being used. A schedule is maintained that causes physical and
mental fatigue. This is primarily accomplished by long hours in which the
participants are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection.

    The third tip-off: techniques used to increase the tension in the room or
environment.

    Number four: Uncertainty. I could spend hours relating various techniques
to increase tension and generate uncertainty. Basically, the participants are
concerned about being "put on the spot" or encountered by the trainers, guilt
feelings are played upon, participants are tempted to verbally relate their
innermost secrets to the other participants or forced to take part in
activities that emphasize removing their masks. One of the most successful
human-potential seminars forces the participants to stand on a stage in front
of the entire audience while being verbally attacked by the trainers. A public
opinion poll, conducted a few years ago, showed that the number one
most-fearful situation an individual could encounter is to speak to an
audience. It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office
building. So you can imagine the fear and tension this situation generates
within the participants. Many faint, but most cope with the stress by mentally
going away. They literally go into an alpha state, which automatically makes
them many times as suggestible as they normally are. And another loop of the
downward spiral into conversion is successfully effected.

    The fifth clue that conversion tactics are being used is the introduction
of jargon--new terms that have meaning only to the "insiders" who participate.
Vicious language is also frequently used, purposely, to make participants
uncomfortable.

    The final tip-off is that there is no humor in the communications . . . at
least until the participants are converted. Then, merry-making and humor are
highly desirable as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly
"found."

    I'm not saying that good does not result from participation in such
gatherings. It can and does. But I contend it is important for people to know
what has happened and to be aware that continual involvement may not be in
their best interest.

    Over the years, I've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be
hypnotists, trainers, and counselors. I've had many of those who conduct
trainings and rallies come to me and say, "I'm here because I know that what
I'm doing works, but I don't know why." After showing them how and why, many
have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or
in a much more loving and supportive manner.

    Many of these trainers have become personal friends, and it scares us all
to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full
of people. Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of
conversions. The sad truth is that a high percentage of people want to give
away their power--they are true "believers"!

    Cult gatherings or human-potential trainings are an ideal environment to
observe first-hand what is technically called the "Stockholm Syndrome." This
is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made to
suffer, begin to love, admire, and even sometimes sexually desire their
controllers or captors.

    But let me inject a word of warning here: If you think you can attend such
gatherings and not be affected, you are probably wrong. A perfect example is
the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study
Haitian Voodoo. In her report, she related how the music eventually induced
uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness. Although
she understood the process and thought herself above it, when she began to
feel herself become vulnerable to the music, she attempted to fight it and
turned away. Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion. A few
moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance
around the Voodoo meeting house. A brain phase had been induced by the music
and excitement, and she awoke feeling reborn. The only hope of attending such
gatherings without being affected is to be a Buddha and allow no positive or
negative emotions to surface. Few people are capable of such detachment.

    Before I go on, let's go back to the six tip-offs to conversion. I want to
mention the United States Government and military boot camp. The Marine Corps
talks about breaking men down before "rebuilding" them as new men--as marines!
Well, that is exactly what they do, the same way a cult breaks its people down
and rebuilds them as happy flower sellers on your local street corner. Every
one of the six conversion techniques are used in boot camp. Considering the
needs of the military, I'm not making a judgement as to whether that is good
or bad. IT IS A FACT that the men are effectively brainwashed. Those who won't
submit must be discharged or spend much of their time in the brig.

Decognition Process

    Once the initial conversion is effected, cults, armed services, and
similar groups cannot have cynicism among their members. Members must respond
to commands and do as they are told, otherwise they are dangerous to the
organizational control. This is normally accomplished as a three-step 
Decognition Process.

    Step One is ALERTNESS REDUCTION: The controllers cause the nervous system
to malfunction, making it difficult to distinguish between fantasy and
reality. This can be accomplished in several ways. POOR DIET is one; watch out
for Brownies and Koolaid. The sugar throws the nervous system off. More subtle
is the "SPIRITUAL DIET" used by many cults. They eat only vegetables and
fruits; without the grounding of grains, nuts, seeds, dairy products, fish or
meat, an individual becomes mentally "spacey." INADEQUATE SLEEP is another
primary way to reduce alertness, especially when combined with long hours of
work or intense physical activity. Also, being bombarded with intense and
unique experiences achieves the same result.

    Step Two is PROGRAMMED CONFUSION: You are mentally assaulted while your
alertness is being reduced as in Step One. This is accomplished with a deluge
of new information, lectures, discussion groups, encounters or one-to-one
processing, which usually amounts to the controller bombarding the individual
with questions. During this phase of decognition, reality and illusion often
merge and perverted logic is likely to be accepted.

    Step Three is THOUGHT STOPPING: Techniques are used to cause the mind to
go "flat." These are altered-state-of-consciousness techniques that initially
induce calmness by giving the mind something simple to deal with and focusing
awareness. The continued use brings on a feeling of elation and eventually
hallucination. The result is the reduction of thought and eventually, if used
long enough, the cessation of all thought and withdrawal from everyone and
everything except that which the controllers direct. The takeover is then
complete. It is important to be aware that when members or participants are
instructed to use "thought-stopping" techniques, they are told that they will
benefit by so doing: they will become "better soldiers" or "find
enlightenment."

    There are three primary techniques used for thought stopping. The first is
MARCHING: the thump, thump, thump beat literally generates self-hypnosis and
thus great susceptibility to suggestion.

    The second thought stopping technique is MEDITATION. If you spend an hour
to an hour and a half a day in meditation, after a few weeks, there is a great
probability that you will not return to full beta consciousness. You will
remain in a fixed state of alpha for as long as you continue to meditate. I'm
not saying this is bad--if you do it yourself. It may be very beneficial. But
it is a fact that you are causing your mind to go flat. I've worked with
meditators on an EEG machine and the results are conclusive: the more you
meditate, the flatter your mind becomes until, eventually and especially if
used to excess or in combination with decognition, all thought ceases. Some
spiritual groups see this as nirvana--which is bullshit. It is simply a
predictable physiological result. And if heaven on earth is non-thinking and
non-involvement, I really question why we are here.

    The third thought-stopping technique is CHANTING, and often chanting in
meditation. "Speaking in tongues" could also be included in this category.
    All three-stopping techniques produce an altered state of consciousness.
This may be very good if YOU are controlling the process, for you also control
the input. I personally use at least one self-hypnosis programming session
every day and I know how beneficial it is for me. But you need to know if you
use these techniques to the degree of remaining continually in alpha that,
although you'll be very mellow, you'll also be more suggestible.

True Believers & Mass Movements

    Before ending this section on conversion, I want to talk about the people
who are most susceptible to it and about Mass Movements. I am convinced that
at least a third of the population is what Eric Hoffer calls "true believers."
They are joiners and followers . . . people who want to give away their power.
They look for answers, meaning, and enlightenment outside themselves.

    Hoffer, who wrote THE TRUE BELIEVER, a classic on mass movements, says,
"true believers are not intent on bolstering and advancing a cherished self,
but are those craving to be rid of unwanted self. They are followers, not
because of a desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy their
passion for self-renunciation!" Hoffer also says that true believers "are
eternally incomplete and eternally insecure"!

    I know this from my own experience. In my years of communicating concepts
and conducting trainings, I have run into them again and again. All I can do
is attempt to show them that the only thing to seek is the True Self within.
Their personal answers are to be found there and there alone. I communicate
that the basics of spirituality are self-responsibility and self-actualization.
 But most of the true believers just tell me that I'm not spiritual and go
looking for someone who will give them the dogma and structure they desire.

    Never underestimate the potential danger of these people. They can easily
be molded into fanatics who will gladly work and die for their holy cause. It
is a substitute for their lost faith in themselves and offers them as a
substitute for individual hope. The Moral Majority is made up of true
believers. All cults are composed of true believers. You'll find them in
politics, churches, businesses, and social cause groups. They are the fanatics
in these organizations.

    Mass Movements will usually have a charismatic leader. The followers want
to convert others to their way of living or impose a new way of life--if
necessary, by legislating laws forcing others to their view, as evidenced by
the activities of the Moral Majority. This means enforcement by guns or
punishment, for that is the bottomline in law enforcement.

    A common hatred, enemy, or devil is essential to the success of a mass
movement. The Born-Again Christians have Satan himself, but that isn't
enough--they've added the occult, the New Age thinkers and, lately, all those
who oppose their integration of church and politics, as evidenced in their
political reelection campaigns against those who oppose their views. In
revolutions, the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy. Some
human-potential movements are far too clever to ask their graduates to join
anything, thus labeling themselves as a cult--but, if you look closely, you'll
find that their devil is anyone and everyone who hasn't taken their training.

    There are mass movements without devils but they seldom attain major
status. The True Believers are mentally unbalanced or insecure people, or
those without hope or friends. People don't look for allies when they love,
but they do when they hate or become obsessed with a cause. And those who
desire a new life and a new order feel the old ways must be eliminated before
the new order can be built.

Persuasion Techniques

    Persuasion isn't technically brainwashing but it is the manipulation of
the human mind by another individual, without the manipulated party being
aware what caused his opinion shift. I only have time to very basically
introduce you to a few of the thousands of techniques in use today, but the
basis of persuasion is always to access your RIGHT BRAIN. The left half of
your brain is analytical and rational. The right side is creative and
imaginative. That is overly simplified but it makes my point. So, the idea is
to distract the left brain and keep it busy. Ideally, the persuader generates
an eyes-open altered state of consciousness, causing you to shift from beta
awareness into alpha; this can be measured on an EEG machine.

    First, let  me give you an example of distracting the left brain.
Politicians use these powerful techniques all the time; lawyers use many
variations which, I've been told, they call "tightening the noose."

    Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech.
First, he might generate what is called a "YES SET." These are statements that
will cause listeners to agree; they might even unknowingly nod their heads in
agreement. Next come the TRUISMS. These are usually facts that could be
debated but, once the politician has his audience agreeing, the odds are in
the politician's favor that the audience won't stop to think for themselves,
thus continuing to agree. Last comes the SUGGESTION. This is what the
politician wants you to do and, since you have been agreeing all along, you
could be persuaded to accept the suggestion. Now, if you'll listen closely to
my political speech, you'll find that the first three are the "yes set," the
next three are truisms and the last is the suggestion.

    "Ladies and gentlemen: are you angry about high food prices? Are you tired
of astronomical gas prices? Are you sick of out-of-control inflation? Well,
you know the Other Party allowed 18 percent inflation last year; you know
crime has increased 50 percent nationwide in the last 12 months, and you know
your paycheck hardly covers your expenses any more. Well, the answer to
resolving these problems is to elect me, John Jones, to the U.S. Senate."

    And I think you've heard all that before. But you might also watch for
what are called Imbedded Commands. As an example: On key words, the speaker
would make a gesture with his left hand, which research has shown is more apt
to access your right brain. Today's media-oriented politicians and
spellbinders are often carefully trained by a whole new breed of specialist
who are using every trick in the book--both old and new--to manipulate you
into accepting their candidate.

    The concepts and techniques of Neuro-Linguistics are so heavily protected
that I found out the hard way that to even talk about them publicly or in
print results in threatened legal action. Yet Neuro-Linguistic training is
readily available to anyone willing to devote the time and pay the price. It
is some of the most subtle and powerful manipulation I have yet been exposed
to. A good friend who recently attended a two-week seminar on Neuro-Linguistics
found that many of those she talked to during the breaks were government
people.

    Another technique that I'm just learning about is unbelievably slippery;
it is called an INTERSPERSAL TECHNIQUE and the idea is to say one thing with
words but plant a subconscious impression of something else in the minds of
the listeners and/or watchers.

    Let me give you an example: Assume you are watching a television
commentator make the following statement: SENATOR JOHNSON is assisting local
authorities to clear up the stupid mistakes of companies contributing to the
nuclear waste problems." It sounds like a statement of fact, but, if the
speaker emphasizes the right word, and especially if he makes the proper hand
gestures on the key words, you could be left with the subconscious impression
that Senator Johnson is stupid. That was the subliminal goal of the statement
and the speaker cannot be called to account for anything.

    Persuasion techniques are also frequently used on a much smaller scale
with just as much effectiveness. The insurance salesman knows his pitch is
likely to be much more effective if he can get you to visualize something in
your mind. This is right-brain communication. For instance, he might pause in
his conversation, look slowly around your livingroom and say, "Can you just
imagine this beautiful home burning to the ground?" Of course you can! It is
one of your unconscious fears and, when he forces you to visualize it, you are
more likely to be manipulated into signing his insurance policy.

    The Hare Krishnas, operating in every airport, use what I call SHOCK AND
CONFUSION techniques to distract the left brain and communicate directly with
the right brain. While waiting for a plane, I once watched one operate for
over an hour. He had a technique of almost jumping in front of someone.
Initially, his voice was loud then dropped as he made his pitch to take a book
and contribute money to the cause. Usually, when people are shocked, they
immediately withdraw. In this case they were shocked by the strange
appearance, sudden materialization and loud voice of the Hare Krishna devotee.
In other words, the people went into an alpha state for security because they
didn't want to confront the reality before them. In alpha, they were highly
suggestible so they responded to the suggestion of taking the book; the moment
they took the book, they felt guilty and responded to the second suggestion:
give money. We are all conditioned that if someone gives us something, we have
to give them something in return--in that case, it was money. While watching
this hustler, I was close enough to notice that many of the people he stopped
exhibited an outward sign of alpha--their eyes were actually dilated.

Subliminal Programming

    Subliminals are hidden suggestions that only your subconscious perceives.
They can be audio, hidden behind music, or visual, airbrushed into a picture,
flashed on a screen so fast that you don't consciously see them, or cleverly
incorporated into a picture or design.

    Most audio subliminal reprogramming tapes offer verbal suggestions
recorded at a low volume. I question the efficacy of this technique--in
subliminals are not perceptible, they cannot be effective, and subliminals
recorded below the audible threshold are therefore useless. The oldest audio
subliminal technique uses a voice that follows the volume of the music so
subliminals are impossible to detect without a parametric equalizer. But this
technique is patented and, when I wanted to develop my own line of subliminal
audiocassettes, negotiations with the patent holder proved to be
unsatisfactory. My attorney obtained copies of the patents which I gave to
some talented Hollywood sound engineers, asking them to create a new
technique. They found a way to psycho-acoustically modify and synthesize the
suggestions so that they are projected in the same chord and frequency as the
music, thus giving them the effect of being part of the music. But we found
that in using this technique, there is no way to reduce various frequencies to
detect the subliminals. In other words, although the suggestions are being
heard by the subconscious mind, they cannot be monitored with even the most
sophisticated equipment.

    If we were able to come up with this technique as easily as we did, I can
only imagine how sophisticated the technology has become, with unlimited
government or advertising funding. And I shudder to think about the propaganda
and commercial manipulation that we are exposed to on a daily basis. There is
simply no way to know what is behind the music you hear. It may even be
possible to hide a second voice behind the voice to which you are listening.

    The series by Wilson Bryan Key, Ph.D., on subliminals in advertising and
political campaigns well documents the misuse in many areas, especially
printed advertising in newspapers, magazines, and posters.

    The big question about subliminals is: do they work? And I guarantee you
they do. Not only from the response of those who have used my tapes, but from
the results of such programs as the subliminals behind the music in department
stores. Supposedly, the only message is instructions to not steal: one East
Coast department store chain reported a 37 percent reduction in thefts in the
first nine months of testing.

    A 1984 article in the technical newsletter, "Brain-Mind Bulletin," states
that as much as 99 percent of our cognitive activity may be "non-conscious,"
according to the director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at
the University of Illinois. The lengthy report ends with the statement, "these
findings support the use of subliminal approaches such as taped suggestions
for weight loss and the therapeutic use of hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic
Programming."

Mass Misuse

    I could relate many stories that support subliminal programming, but I'd
rather use my time to make you aware of even more subtle uses of such
programming.

    I have personally experienced sitting in a Los Angeles auditorium with
over ten thousand people who were gathered to listen to a current charismatic
figure. Twenty minutes after entering the auditorium, I became aware that I
was going in and out of an altered state. Those accompanying me experienced
the same thing. Since it is our business, we were aware of what was happening,
but those around us were not. By careful observation, what appeared to be
spontaneous demonstrations were, in fact, artful manipulations. The only way I
could figure that the eyes-open trance had been induced was that a 6- to
7-cycle-per-second vibration was being piped into the room behind the air
conditioner sound. That particular vibration generates alpha, which would
render the audience highly susceptible. Ten to 25 percent of the population is
capable of a somnambulistic level of altered states of consciousness; for
these people, the suggestions of the speaker, if non-threatening, could
potentially be accepted as "commands."

Vibrato

    This leads to the mention of VIBRATO. Vibrato is the tremulous effect
imparted in some vocal or instrumental music, and the cyle-per-second range
causes people to go into an altered state of consciousness. At one period of
English history, singers whose voices contained pronounced vibrato were not
allowed to perform publicly because listeners would go into an altered state
and have fantasies, often sexual in nature.

    People who attend opera or enjoy listening to singers like Mario Lanza are
familiar with this altered state induced by the performers.

ELFs

    Now, let's carry this awareness a little farther. There are also inaudible
ELFs (extra-low frequency waves). These are electromagnetic in nature. One of
the primary uses of ELFs is to communicate with our submarines. Dr. Andrija
Puharich, a highly respected researcher, in an attempt to warn U.S. officials
about Russian use of ELFs, set up an experiment. Volunteers were wired so
their brain waves could be measured on an EEG. They were sealed in a metal
room that could not be penetrated by a normal signal.

    Puharich then beamed ELF waves at the volunteers. ELFs go right through
the earth and, of course, right through metal walls. Those inside couldn't
know if the signal was or was not being sent. And Puharich watched the
reactions on the technical equipment: 30 percent of those inside the room were
taken over by the ELF signal in six to ten seconds.

    When I say "taken over," I mean that their behavior followed the changes
anticipated at very precise frequencies. Waves below 6 cycles per second
caused the subjects to become very emotionally upset, and even disrupted
bodily functions. At 8.2 cycles, they felt very high . . . an elevated
feeling, as though they had been in masterful meditation, learned over a
period of years. Eleven to 11.3 cycles induced waves of depressed agitation
leading to riotous behavior.

The Neurophone

    Dr. Patrick Flanagan is a personal friend of mine. In the early 1960s, as
a teenager, Pat was listed as one of the top scientists in the world by "Life"
magazine. Among his many inventions was a device he called the Neurophone--an
electronic instrument that can successfully programm suggestions directly
through contact with the skin. When he attempted to patent the device, the
government demanded that he prove it worked. When he did, the National
Security Agency confiscated the neurophone. It took Pat two years of legal
battle to get his invention back.

    In using the device, you don't hear or see a thing; it is applied to the
skin, which Pat claims is the source of special senses. The skin contains more
sensors for heat, touch, pain, vibration, and electrical fields than any other
part of the human anatomy.

    In one of his recent tests, Pat conducted two identical seminars for a
military audience--one seminar one night and one the next night, because the
size of the room was not large enough to accommodate all of them at one time.
When the first group proved to be very cool and unwilling to respond, Patrick
spent the next day making a special tape to play at the second seminar. The
tape instructed the audience to be extremely warm and responsive and for their
hands to become "tingly." The tape was played through the neurophone, which
was connected to a wire he placed along the ceiling of the room. There were no
speakers, so no sound could be heard, yet the message was successfully
transmitted from that wire directly into the brains of the audience. They were
warm and receptive, their hands tingled and they responded, according to
programming, in other ways that I cannot mention here.

    The more we find out about how human beings work through today's highly
advanced technological research, the more we learn to control human beings.
And what probably scares me the most is that the medium for takeover is
already in place! The television set in your livingroom and bedroom is doing a
lot more than just entertaining you.

    Before I continue, let me point out something else about an altered state
of consciousness. When you go into an altered state, you transfer into right
brain, which results in the internal release of the body's own opiates:
enkephalins and Beta-endorphins, chemically almost identical to opium. In
other words, it feels good . . . and you want to come back for more.

    Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while viewers were
watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a ratio
of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were in an altered state . . . in
trance more often than not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin "fix."

    To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the
Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young viewers to an EEG
machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the children's brains
produced a majority of alpha waves. Although the children were told to
concentrate, only a few could keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!

    Most viewers are already hypnotized. To deepen the trance is easy. One
simple way is to place a blank, black frame every 32 frames in the film that
is being projected. This creates a 45-beat-per-minute pulsation perceived only
by the subconscious mind--the ideal pace to generate deep hypnosis.

    The commercials or suggestions presented following this alpha-inducing
broadcast are much more likely to be accepted by the viewer. The high
percentage of the viewing audience that has somnambulistic-depth ability could
very well accept the suggestions as commands--as long as those commands did
not ask the viewer to do something contrary to his morals, religion, or
self-preservation.

    The medium for takeover is here. By the age of 16, children have spent
10,000 to 15,000 hours watching television--that is more time than they spend
n school! In the average home, the TV set is on for six hours and 44 minutes
per day--an increase of nine minutes from last year and three times the
average rate of increase during the 1970s.

    It obviously isn't getting better . . . we are rapidly moving into an
alpha-level world--very possibly the Orwellian world of "1984"--placid,
glassy-eyed, and responding obediently to instructions.

    A research project by Jacob Jacoby, a Purdue University psychologist,
found that of 2,700 people tested, 90 percent misunderstood even such simple
viewing fare as commercials and "Barnaby Jones." Only minutes after watching,
the typical viewer missed 23 to 36 percent of the questions about what he or
she had seen. Of course they did--they were going in and out of trance! If you
go into a deep trance, you must be instructed to remember--otherwise you
automatically forget.

    I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. When you start to combine
subliminal messages behind the music, subliminal visuals projected on the
screen, hypnotically produced visual effects, sustained musical beats at a
trance-inducing pace . . . you have extremely effective brainwashing. Every
hour that you spend watching the TV set you become more conditioned. And, in
case you thought there was a law against any of these things, guess again.
There isn't! There are a lot of powerful people who obviously prefer things
exactly the way they are. Maybe they have plans for us?

                    The Digital Murder Trip To Houston!

 We had finally decided to do it.  Xmascon was going to
become a reality. When I first got Phrack 35, I read the ad
for Xmascon.  I merely made a suggestion to Technysis that
we should go.  He immediately became serious about going. 
At first, i did not really think anything about it.  but as
time passed, I started to think about the means of getting
to Houston, and surviving for three days.  We considered
everything, bus, plane, rental car, and finally decided to
drive the 'trusty' (Yeah Right!) 83 blazer.  School let out
for Christmas, and I decided to go visit my parents for a
little while.  Christmas expenses being what they are, my
money supply was running short.  We had figured on a little
over $100 dollars apiece for the trip, and it looked like i
was not going to have that much cash.  Finally on Dec 25th,
we made up our minds and decided to just go.  The plan was
for Technysis, and Acid Rocker to meet at my house at 8:00
on the 26th.  The 26th rolled around, I left my parents
house and arrived in Memphis around 5:00 pm. Everyone showed
up on time, and we packed the truck up with all of our misc
shit and left to go pick up Morpheus in Mississippi.  We
arrived at Morpheus' house, and he was asleep at the time. 
While he packed, I was given a lot of well intentioned
travel advice by his grandfather.  I listened to his advice,
but I decided it would be best for us to travel on our
original path.  At the very least I was somewhat familiar
with the first leg of the trip.  Everything was packed in
the truck, and we were ready to hit the road.  Before we
could start though, Technysis whipped out a bottle of white
shoe polish.  We painted the truck's windows with our
intentions; XMASCON OR BUST on the side windows. Our handles
and the broken bell symbol was the decoration for the back
of the truck.  As we would find out later the XMASCON OR
BUST would become REAL meaningful later on.  

 The blazer set out into the dimly lit highway 55 South.
We made it out of Mississippi and into the Cajun state of
Louisiana.  Morpheus, was trying to tell me and the others
about the Hoo-Doo-Voo-Doo people that lived under the
bridges and the hexes and spells that they could put on you. 
Out of Louisiana, and into the great state of Texas.  We
were surprised by a few of the drivers in the 'Lone Star
State'.  One guy, for some reason that still remains
unknown.  Pulled up beside us, rolled down his window, and
held out a sheet of paper and started to wave his finger. 
He seemed to be pissed about something.  Who knows? Maybe he
was a bell employee, and was not to happy with our 'No Bell'
sign on the back.  We finally pulled into Houston, and ended
up at the wrong airport Hilton.  After asking for directions
to the other Hilton we set out on the road again.  After
another 45 minutes of driving, we had reached our
destination.  We checked into the hotel.  Upon arriving in
our room, I hit the bed.  

 I was awoken by the sounds of people talking in the room. 
It was the DM staff, and some of the locals that we had met
when we first checked in.  (Sorry, but I don't recall their
handles).  We thought that we were the only people there,
but as it turns out Crimson Death, Disapater, and Bruce
Sterling had checked in before us.  We went down to their
room and talked for a little while.  As the day went on,
more and more people arrived.  Technysis and I went down to
the local market and got a case and a half of beer, and
brought it back to the hotel.  By this time there were a few
more people there, or at least they came out of their rooms. 
We drank a little beer, and looked at some magazines and
newspapers that someone had brought.  Friday evening, some
people got together and decided to send out for some liquor. 
Everyone (well, almost) chipped in and they brought back
cartons of all types of liquor.  Luckily, someone there had
a connection and bought the stuff at cost.  The way that I
understood it, we got $400 dollars worth of liquor for
somewhere around $100.  To say the least, Friday night was a
good time to be an  alcoholic.  Everyone, including myself
was drunk.  Technysis, had his fill of liquor that night. 
While I was passed out on the bed, he was laying in the
floor making recalling his dinner, all over the floor.  That
was about all that I remember Friday night.

(My Bad Day Starts)  
(Hey what's wrong with the Transmission ?!?!?)

 Although I slept well that night, I woke up the next
morning, to the smell of something rotten.  Technysis
cleaned up his mess, and we decided to go get something to
eat.  I went outside and started the truck, and discovered
that the transmission had decided to die. Now you know why
Xmascon or bust was meaningful!  Needless to say, I was not in
a very good mood.  After all, we were 13 hours from home,
and almost broke.  I called a transmission shop and they
dispatched a wrecker to come and get my truck.  By the
time all this had happened, the main conference had started.
As I heard someone say, this was the only 4 hour period
during the whole weekend when everyone was sober.  I
grabbed my video camera and decided to make the best of the
situation.  Down at the conf. room, I was surprised to find
that it was standing room only.  From what I remember, there
was the EFF Lawyer, The Phrack Staff, Comsec, some MIT
videos, and  Bruce Sterling.  Though not nessacairly in that
order.  After leaving the conf., I called the main desk and
checked to see if the guy from the transmission shop had
called.  As it turns out he had called.  I returned his
call, and he informed me that it was not something simple.
(Or as I interpreted it, not something that I could afford). 
Since there is some kind of law that states transmission
shops can't be open on Sundays, we were stuck in Houston
till at least Monday.  

   Saturday night was a lot of fun.  We all chipped in
again,  and ordered some more liquor.  I grabbed the video
camera, and went around to get some footage of the party.  I
found a few interesting things to film such as the 'worlds
longest burp', and 'beige boxing by the Kodez Kidz'.  There
were also a lot of interesting people that I got interviews
with. I interviewed the Hilton security guard, and he
described some of the things that went on at the party.  A
couple of things that went on were the burning of a bible in
the parking lot, and some of the plates covering the phone
lines were removed from the wall.  Anyway, if you want to
see the interviews order the video tape. 

  I decided to go back to the room and sit around and watch
some TV.  About 4:00 in the morning someone banged on our
door and said 'Strippers'.  We all ran down to the conference
room, and met the girls.  There were four girls  in all, and
two of them decided to dance.  Acid Rocker had the video
camera and filmed the whole thing.  We saw one of the 'Kodez
Kidz' apparently getting his first kiss.  He had a kinda
surprised look on his face.  I decided to go back to
the room and get some sleep.  The girls did not come back
that nite (THANK GOD! *Editor's Note*).  

  Sunday, almost everyone had left.  The CDC guys were still
there, and some other people. Nothing much went on Sunday. 
Morpheus and I decided to start on out articles for the
magazine.  We typed them in on an Atari Portfolio.  This is
not recommended for long articles.  

  Monday we were pretty much the only people there.  I had the
bank up here in Memphis wire some money to Houston.  When we
walked down to the bank to pick up the money, the bitch at
the counter was throwing up a lot of attitude.  She gave us
a lot of shit, so we left and decided to come back later. 
When I got back to the hotel, I called the main branch of
that bank.  I finally got a hold of someone that knew what
he was talking about.  He said that the wire had come in,
and I could go pick it up.  I walked back down to the bank,
and stated that I would like to pick up my money.  The lady
(bitch) still said that it was not there.  I told her to
call the main branch and talk to Mr. Doe.  She then decided
that my money was there after all.  To this day, I can't
understand this lady's problem.  Back at the hotel, we
called about my truck.  The guy said that he would bring it
by when it was done.  About 7:00 the truck did arrive, and
we packed it up and hit the road.  We stopped at Taco Bell
in Houston and then left for Memphis.  We arrived in Memphis
Tuesday morning about 8:00.

 Well, it seems as though everyone is writing their own account
of the trip to   Xmascon, so I guess I will join the bandwagon,
plus a few notes and feelings at   the end. 
 
 Our trip was getting off to a good start. We all met over at
Chizz's place, except Morpheus, and got ready and packed up the
Blazer. When we got over to   Morpheus's place, we were pissed to
find that he was not packed and ready.   While he was packing,
his grandparents were torturing us with different ways   that
what we wanted to get to Houston. After a long 10 minutes, we
were ready   to start our voyage. However, while walking to the
Blazer, I had an idea. We   decorated the windows with messages
of hope, but turned to dismay as you will   see, but the
highlight was the Bell logo in the middle, with a NO symbol
around   it, and most importantly the crack, the symbol of the
hackers mastery over the   phone system. Now that was out of the
way, the long 13 hour trip was to   start. Chizz driving, and me
riding shotgun, Morpheus and Acid Rocker were in   the back,
doing God knows what, hehe. Everything was fine, and made a stop
in   Jackson, Miss. for gas and relief. But, the next part gets
interesting. Once we   get over the Louisiana border, Morpheus
starts talking shit about voodoo magic,   and the Cajuns and
shit. I guess you would have to be there to really understand  
what all happened. ( By the way Morph., did you ever get to leave
you house   again? What else did they bury? ) Anyway, everything
was fine till we hit Texas.   This place had to be bridge hell.
Everywhere you looked, just bridges, like   they had no concept
of what roads were. To make it short, we finally arrived   at the
Hilton, after clear across town we went to the wrong one, and
crashed almost immediately in the room. 
 
 After awhile of resting, we went roaming around the hotel. So
far there was only 3 people in one room, and on down the hall,
probably the first to get   there, The Disapator, Crimson Death,
and forgive me, someone else that I can't   seem to place. After
hanging out with them for awhile, several people start   showing
up, soon they just start pouring. Me and Chizz decide that the
time has   come, so we left to go find some Spirits of
Intoxication. We ended up at some   Arabian store and bought 3 12
packed of beer, let me remind you that the   drinking had just
begun. When we got back, someone had mentioned, "Hey, guess  
this is the first beer of the Con. ", so we passed him one. While
talking for   awhile, we decided to split up, and we left the
beer in the room, which proved   to be a big mistake when we
later came looking for it. By this time, there was   a
considerable amount of people there, so since it was around 7:00
or so,   (major time jump huh?), we decided to get something to
eat. When we got back,   there was a mention of buying some
liquor, so everyone pitched in $5. Later when   it came, I
believe everyone got fucked up. As for me and Chizz, we decided
that   the Spirits of Intoxication were calling our names. I had
been drinking heavily,   Vodka, Crown Royal, Segrams 7, and
various others, then it happened. Someone   started making
Mexican Flags, which will soon prove to be my downfall. After  
drinking one, which was sweet as hell, I filled my glass back up
with Crown   Royal and went back to he room where the others
were. Let me remind you that   these glasses were about equal to
5-6 shots apiece when full, as they were. At   the room, me and
Chizz start drinking the glasses like shots, and at that time   I
felt real good, and numb. I said that I would go back and try and
snatch the   rest of the bottle, so I left the room. Well, I
never made it back to the room, instead, I have 3 more glasses of
Crown Royal. Then, all of a sudden, Chizz   pops in to see where
I had gone. After drinking more in the conf. room, we get   1
final glass, and leave to go back to the room. There, we finish
off the whole   glass, and somewhere around there is where I lost
it, and passed out. Later on   that night, I woke up in the
floor, next to a pile of underdone chicken   McNuggets which I
had eaten the day before, so I went to the bathroom, deposited  
more int the toilet, and sat down in the chair till the next
morning. 
 
 Later that morning, Acid Rocker was the first to wake up. I was
sitting in he   chair awake. After awhile, they filled me in on
the nights events, which I didn't exactly like, but oh well.
Everyone took a shower, and then it was my turn. We were going to
get some breakfast. The meeting was to start at 12:00.   While I
was taking a shower, they all piled into Chizz's Blazer and
started bumping some bass. Then it happened. While fucking
around, he tried to move the   car, but the transmission had done
given out. Pretty shitty eh? About that time, here I came ready
to go, but my plans were cut short when  I heard the news. So  
the next logical step was to call " Fat Redneck Transmission
Repair ", which was   pretty expensive for way they did. (
Forward in time! ) 

 Ok, it is now 2:00 p.m., and it was time for the conference to
start. There   were several speakers, including the two former
members of Legion of Doom.   Their lecture was the better of the
ones presented. After all the lectures   were over, there were
several videos shown. One covered the steam tunnels under  
M.I.T., which was pretty funny. Several of the Cult of the Dead
Cow members   (!oooM), were involved in it. After that, the video
of, "Now it can be told",   was shown, and would have made any
would be hacker laugh his ass off. The next   were parts of the
2600 video of the Dutch hacker, which was very informative.   All
this lasted around 4 hours. After that, the conference was pretty
much over.   Everyone just sorta lingered around talking, looking
over the visual aids,   books, and shit brought by the various
people involved with the Con. Now the   real part of the Con was
beginning to take place. the main part was the little   groups of
people, talking and sharing info among these separate groups. I  
learned more this way than any other. 
 
 That night, even more liquor was bought than the previous night.
I was cool.   Even though that I swore I would not drink anymore,
the Spirits of Intoxication called Chizz and I closer and
closer until I was drinking some Tequila. Haha,   so much for the
AA class I was going to attend. Anyways, that night served at  
the ' Late Night drunk Cam ', going around and getting quotes and
shit from   various people. Probably the best, was the Clifford
Stoll imitation by Doc Cyphir, 49 million bits per second huh?
Anyway, we proceeded to tape fellow Con people   getting drunk
and all. We finally got tired and retired to our room for some  
time to ponder just exactly what had happened. While we were
watching t.v., it   happened. Mopheus bust into the room, saying
that the strippers had arrived. We   had heard some word about
it, but didn't really believe it, but after some of   the stuff
had happened, there was no reason to doubt it. We headed to the  
conference room, where everything was being set up for the show.
After a short   while, it started. There was close to 30 people
in there, and the two strippers   up front. Everything went cool.
It was extremely seeing people going up there   with their money,
and getting kissed for the first time, haha. Good thing it   was
caught on tape. Acid Rocker was doing the tape, but how he put up
with the   lighting problems, ( i.e. big objects, hehe ), I will
never know. That is a   story he will have to tell in his own
way. Needless to say, after that, it was   basically over. People
continued to get drunk, and most left the next day, but   there
were still alot of cool people left to talk and hang out with.

                              Subliminality w/ Guido

                  ----------------------------------------------------------
     EDITORS NOTE:  In our quest for certainty, we have found that  we  must
     invoke a humorous muse now and then to keep the left side of the  brain
     active and distorted so the right side can be used to focus on this and
     other enlightening articles.  Press Fnordward into the depths  of  D.M.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------


   Well, the title of this little SA may sound confusing, fnord and forboding,
but contrary to what you are thinking, it really is.  The way I see and hear
and in other ways sense it, life is meant to be subliminal.  You can have fun
and prophet throughout life if you just remain predominantly subliminal.  Let
me explain for those of you less enlightened fellows/fellaws.  Subliminality
is the characteristic(s) of influencing people/places/things without being 
noticed. I recommend the works of Malaclypse the Younger <Principia Discordia>
and film director John Carpenter <They Live> for some wonderful primers on 
subliminality.  Even more fun than invoking subliminality in yourself and 
others is subliminiphobia <hah!I just made up a word!> which is other people's
<and quite possibly your own> fear of all things unknown and subliminal.  
Subliminiphobia can be fun and satisfying to you and your loved ones in many
ways.  Here are a few suggestions:

	1) Write arcane symbols and glyphs in and around frequented locations.
Some good ideas are "Jahbulon" <pronounced yah-ba-lawn> "Fnord" <pronounced
ford> and your favorite gang symbols.  This always gets the desired effects
out of those that view.

	2) Carouse around the halls of your favorite public establishment 
chanting your favorite arcane incantations.  Can't think of any? Just think of
the strangest noun you know of, and add a couple of verbs and adjectives and
TA DAA! Instant incantation! Examples : <The word would be kangaroo> If you
were'nt a kangaroo, you would be an excellent mailman. <The word would be 
lemon> The lemon people! They're in my head!  Those are some of my favorite,
and they never fail to make people wonder why.

	3) Carry strange artifacts around school, just barely noticeable.
Some REALLY good ones are face sculpu]ture necklaces, drug paraphenalia as
necklaces, and assorted canes & staves.  The smaller and less noticeable the
better as subliminaliphobia is best enjoyed when served unexpectedly.

	4) Whisper unintelligible things into people's ears and other orifices
often.  This really gets them on edge, as they don't know what you're saying,
and when revoked the privelage of knowledge, mankind gets quite peeved.  Some
fun examples can be taken from Monty Python names of people such as "Rupert 
Luxury Yacht" or "Throat-Warbler Mangrove".  

	5) The only reason there is a fifth reason is because of fnord and the
law of fives.

     6) Researching customs of secret societies and practicing them are also
 fun things to do. Practicing secret handshakes and the like on friends will be
sure to jolt them up, until you run into a real member and the joke becomes 
upon you.  In short, subliminality is fun to mess around with, but if you 
practice it too often, you're bound to be discovered by others.  So have fun
with subliminaliphobia, and beware of the mushroom girls.

Title: won't try
Reply: This message has 1 reply

I don't know who's worse.. people who can't understand or those who choose not
to try. I tried last night to explain to two people I've known for a long time
that there are no questions to which the only answers are "yes" or "no". I
tried to explain to them that God, as in the Christian and other 'Religious'
beliefs does not exist. I tried to explain why I can fly and I will never die,
and why they could do the same. They simply told me that I was wrong. They
never even considered that I might be right. How do I know? They never asked me
the ONE question that would prove that they understood that I was even trying
to explain anything at all. They never asked  "Why??". They simply said "you're
wrong" and proceeded to shovel bullshit at me. They stated all the old cliches
about religion and life after death, and tried to avoid and destroy the
argument that I eventually won. They could not understand, they could not
avoid, they could not destroy, so they became AFRAID. They are afraid of me
because I don't agree with them like all the other brainwashed sheep. They are
afraid of my ideas and the truth that I have found because it means that their
years of brainwashing were wrong. For example, I stated that if all questions
were "yes" or "no" answers, what would be the answer to the question "What
flavor Ice cream do you like?". That is certainly a question with more than two
answers. If the question is "Do you like ice cream?" the possible answers
become  "yes", "no", "I've never experienced ice cream", "I like specific types
of ice cream but not others" or "I like ice cream at specific times or after
specific meals but not at others". I explained that I understand the concept of
Infinity. They asked me " then what am I thinking?". I tried to explain to them
that Comprehending Infinity and knowing everything were completely different.
They wouldn't listen. I even gave the example " I comprehend the Universe, but
I don't know every detail of it. I comprehend computers, but I don't know every
detail of how they work.". They stuck to their monomaniacal quest to prove
their point no matter how many times I disproved it. My argument never changed.
My whole point was that each individual has his own reality. I can fly because
the Mind does not know the difference between imagination and 'reality'. They
wouldn't listen. So, I might as well have been talking to mindless,
thoughtless, brainless OBJECTS. It would have made a better conversation.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Battle on!  fight the government, whoever they are!  Defeat  those  who
     fear truth and reality!  What is real is not what we live, we live that
     which others have made to seem real.   Reality  is  Truth  and  Freedom
     surrounded by a sense of common purpose, and  that  common  purpose  is
     survival of the intelligent and death of the weak-minded.  To learn  is
     to live, to UNDERSTAND is to reign.  By censoring our words and actions
     the weak-minded class have controlled the actions and experiences of us
     (the thinking class) so that we pose no (obvious) threat to  them.  The
     government is made up completely of the weak class and so  is  most  of
     the rest of the world and it is only natural that they conspire against
     us.  They are common, we are uncommon; "abnormal".  When the  mentality
     of the mob takes over, the first thing to be destroyed  is  that  which
     sticks out, that which is different, abnormal, and  yes,  better.  This
     is why all those who understand the cause, knowing that it  exists  and
     WHY, are in danger.

     It is not because we have done anything "wrong" or even broken  any  of
     the weak class's written laws.  We have broken the unwritten law of the
     non-thinkers that states "No man shall be different or better,  and  no
     man shall tolerate anyone who is".  With our superior understanding and
     mental skills we are better suited for life than they.  Our numbers are
     increasing daily, and their numbers decrease due to their own  ignorant
     stupidity.  They kill each other in the streets  over  drugs  and  even
     shoes and jackets and then blame us because we should be helping  them.
     They know that they are unhelpable but they can't admit that anyone  is
     better than they because that would mean that they were wrong to  begin
     with.  The non-thinker avoids such thought-provoking situations at  all
     costs, even to the point where his own life is given up  for  something
     as petty as a piece of clothing.  Take my shoes; take my  jacket;  take
     my computer, my arms, my legs, my speech, my sight, but you  can  never
     touch my mind.  We, the thinkers  of  INFOWORD,  will  survive  forever
     because we are people of the mind.

     The mind is the one thing  in  this  existance  that  cannot  be  truly
     controlled.  Long live the  thinking  class!   May  we  find  yet  more
     brothers and sisters among those who seem to be lost.

     Although I am not a big consumer in the visual arts world, I did recently
     pick up a copy of NUMBER: magazine (well, it was free).  NUMBER: is an
     independent quarterly that focuses on the visual arts in the tri-state
     region of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas.  It contains interesting
     articles and essays discussing art education, the history of the art
     world, mind boggling information on the reality of illusions (my favorite
     type of reading--enhances my subliminity), and interviews of well-known
     artists around the country.  It is the 'Digital Murder Magazine' of the
     art world (am I allowed to say that?).  Its fabulous layout and mind-
     expanding photos <<of killer artwork>> make it a magazine worth checking
     out.  Write them for price information.

     Also check out THE FIFTH PATH magazine out of CA.  It's a definite
     ''must read'' if you are into gothik and/or industrial music.  Issue
     two contained interviews of Rozz Williams (ex: Christian Death member),
     Skinheads in Germany (yikes!), as well as reviews on a great assortment
     of 'alternative' audio, video, and printed material.

     If train -A-, carrying a lot of passengers, leaves Los Angeles
     traveling ''very fast'' and train -B-, carrying a lot more 
     passengers, leaves New York City traveling ''somewhat fast''
     (but not as fast as the train from L.A.), in what city and at
     what time will trains -A- and -B- collide and how many people
     will die?

Would it be neat if we were all aliens taking over the planet??  what if real
hackers and phreakers (the one's that look like they're either lost in the 60's
or are lost in space-- see: Punk Rockers and 'Cyberpunks') were actually all the
same race?  Like back in Egypt when historian scientists say UFO's landed, this
race of highly intelligent space beings put hundreds of their kind (our kind)
on the planet (this planet).  These aliens that were put on the earth were
gentically altered to look like humans.  As you can see by examining your
average Joe Cyberpunk, they didn't have human genetics science down pat back
then (or now).  They all (we) are easily spotted in this planet because of our
miscalculated genetic alteration- We have a strange habit of wanting to wear
Leather Jackets with combat boots and a mohawk or little more 'mod' version of
this is all of us that dress ''new wave'' and wear a lot of black.  We are an
expiriment of our celestial ancestors and a hopeful attempt for our race to take
over the planet Earth.  We need to come together as a unified organization and
act as a catalyst and bring the day when our alien relatives come back to take
the planet closer.  We will be at peace as will the entire planet.  Get involved
and unite today.  I will be your messiah.

HOW THIS COLUMN STARTED
-----------------------

I thought it would be ____ if I told everyone how this column got started, where
I got the name, and other interesting details.  Well here's ''the deal'' (see:
Drunk Fux at XMASCON talking to me and Count Zero about schematics.)  One night
when I was just a young little cyberpunk I went out trashing with a friend.  We
hit the garbage cans of several different Southern Bells (The company--not
'southern bells' the women.)  We decided it would be quicker if we just take the
garbage bags and get out as quickly as possible then go through all the bags at
my house later.  It worked out we got more trash that way so I thought of it as
if we were both Indiana Jones' of the techno world.  Getting maps and addresses
to bell buildings as if they were maps to ancient treasures.  So I thought of
all this junk (yes, we did some bags that were nothing but nasty, coffee
stained JUNK) as a sort of treasure.. so I got the name Heaven's Trash from
that and it went along well because I was a dedicated Skinny Puppy fan at the
time.  I would sometimes just type crazy stuph into the computer and save it
to read later..and that's where ''the final words from Morpheus'' in
Digital Murder came from (and still comes from there too!)

BE SUBLIMINAL- BE SUBLIME
-------------------------

Experience the truth of INFOWORD.  Let your senses wander and explore the
wildest depths of your mind.  See the way and discover yourself by joining
together.  Let the day be poetry.  Let life be information and freedom.  Imagine
last night as a sensual exploration that helped build a free nation of
information.  ''Her legs wrapped around me slowly and pulled me closer-- it was
like sculpture.''  Exchanging bodily fluids with a member of the opposite sex is
slightly different than exchanging information electronically but is a form of
physical/mental exchange of information that we promote.  Learn the truths of
INFOWORD through our electronic publications and future works of literature
posted randomly on street-side light posts across the nation.

Be subliminal.  Let your actions speak louder than your words.  Infiltrate and
tantalize the minds of many.  Spread the truths and help unite the planet
physically and mentally.

Be Sublime.  Let your actions transfer energy of a natural, peaceful state.  Let
your words flow through the inner-conscious of society as words of illuminating
intelligence.  Experience the truths of InFOWOrd.

INFOWORD.

          Well what a fine ending for Digital Murder #4.  Next month we
     will dedicate a resonable portion of text to peruse at your own 
     leisure as it will contain no real valuable information.  What will
     this portion of text focus on?  well. . . all I can say is ponder
     over the brain teaser for a while until issue #5 comes out and
     then you can find out for yourself.  So until next month (or until
     George Bush finally decides we ARE in a recession), so long.
