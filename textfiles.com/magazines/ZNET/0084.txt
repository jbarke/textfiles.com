Xx Before We Begin
______________________________________
There are more systems carrying Zmag
than what is contained in this issue.

I called systems over the preceeding
two weeks to capture BBS artwork and
information. I captured so many files,
that I have had to re-edit this issue
4 times to compact the size.

Where I could not get through, I 
listed seperatly.  Lines with BBS
numbers might be reproduced elsewhere
in the issue.  Late entries were
included where possible.

A special thanks to all the systems
carrying Zmagazine this year.  If I
missed your BBS, Please send it in and
we will use it in new issues in 1988.

Without your support, we wouldn't be
as popular as we have become.  There
are still a few out there who havent
heard of us, so look for more systems
next year.

Special additional thanks to Susan
Perry for her assistance, Ken Kirchner
for uploading and ascii'zing the
issues each week, Alan Kloza for his
editing assistance earlier this year,
Rich Decowski for using ZMag in his
monthly magazine disk, Tom Scott for
allowing ZMag a place in his new mag,
and to the many others space doesnt
allow to print.  You know who you are
and I great appreciate your help!
(Lets not forget Calamity Jane, 
MidTown TV, and Mr. Goodprobe!!)

Listing are not in any order, used as
received!

Due to abuse, we have switched to the
call-back system.  To gain access to
this board, you MUST leave your phone
number.  You will be asked for the
number in a minute. The BBS will hang
you up and then immediately thereafter
it will call YOU back.  You must auto-
answer the phone with your modem. From
here you may hit return for your
password and log on as a new user. If
you don't know how to auto-answer,
look at the menu of your terminal
program, and if that fails, consult
the documentation.  Thank you!

Finally, if you are long distance or
having trouble using call-back,
contact me via (614)-471-7268. Ask for
Frank Seipel and I will manually
validate you.

Phone number (e.g. 471-9209):

Call-back okayed!  Will take me
about60seconds to call.  When you
are connected, don't type anything
until you see the HIT RETURN prompt.
See ya!

As you all should know, The Eagle BBS
is up and running.  If you find or
come across any errors (getting logged
off, locking up, ect.) please leave
feedback to the Sysop of this BBS.  We
don't have a hard disk yet, so we are
limited to the amount of room we have
for file transfers.  We will try to
correct this as soon as possible.  You
can post as much as you like, because
messages don't take much storage
space.

If you need anything, please feel free
to ask one of the Sysops of this BBS. 
Spread the word around that The Eagle
BBS is up and running.

**  Remember, this is a Public Domain

|     Carina II  Version 2.0 beta     |
|      by Jerry Horanoff (c)1987      |
|       Carina Software Systems       |


 Updated  11-29-87

I have been getting a lot of people
asking if they could prepay on Carina
II in order to get it as quick as
possible.  At first I was against this
idea, but now that I know that it will
definately be released, I don't think
it is such a bad idea, so if you do
want to prepay, here is the address:

        Carina Software Systems
           322 Natchez Court
           Jupiter, FL 33477

If you are a REGISTERED Carina 1
owner, Carina II is $35.00, otherwise
it is $55.00.

Keep in mind that, like Carina 1, 
Carina II comes with a 30-day money 
back guarantee so you can at any time 
get your money back - up to 30 days 
after you receive the program.

Definition:

            Registered User

One who has sent in his/her
registration card! (i.e. You if you 
were smart)

Uploaders: Thanks!....but.....Some
people uploading aren't bothering to
type in the descriptions (or if they
do, they are very wimpy).  If you're
not going to bother to type in the
description, don't bother uploading it
because it isn't going to get validated
and if you're uploading just so you can
download some more, I will knock you're
access down (which is real depressing
since a new user would have more
access..hehe).
