                                                               by pic 

        Well, hello!

        It appears that your MiLK is now coming through to your computers 
through a different method now. It appears that the MiLKMen are wearing 
different uniforms and bringing different shaped bottles to your house. This 
change perplexes us, and we wonder, is this a GOOD change? Well, let us hope 
so. (Besides, these 'new and improved bottles' appeal to you in your 
subconscious mind because they remind you of the form of a female's body. Or, 
if that's not your thing, they could also be perceived as a phallic symbol.)

        And that's not ALL! Instead of just fresh creamy MiLK to whet your 
text-file thirst, the MiLKMen will also be delivering some Tea along with 
your MiLK. Tea (MUCH MUCH better than Advanced Tea Substitute, if you've ever 
had that) is one of our finest beverages, and will take it's place in the 
refrigerator of life right next to the liters of MiLK (NOT Gallons, damnit! 
Use the metric system, it's the LAW!), the pitchers of Tang(tm), the chilled 
bottles of pills, and of course, your leftover burgers. Breakfast, anyone?

        And so, the readers of this new creation of MiLK and Tea that happen 
to be reading this particular issue (you and me for example) may be 
wondering, so - is epic going to actually write anything in this issue or 
not? Well, I'm pondering that topic myself. I think it must be the only just 
thing to do here. Hmm. Well, in Issue #06 of this magazine thing here, 
Malakai griped and whined and complained about some of the horrors of late 
night television programming. Well, if he had only turned the dial over the 
sales team at the Home Shopping Club, he would have had a fun time. Not to 
mention some SERIOUS savings.

        Oh, the dear Home Shopping Club! Modern technology and civlization at 
it's finest! It's almost as cool as room service. You can sit at home and 
watch the beautiful products on display, and lose yourself in the charm of 
the elegant voices of the hosts of the show. That's just terrific. Wow.

        Sample the superb styling of the malachite jewelry! Hand crafted by 
REAL American Indians. Or perhaps gold is your thing, may I suggest a studded 
pendant! Not many other pendants come out at you and say WOW like this one 
does. Is that not a chunk? That is INDEED a CHUNK. Terrific.

       <DING!!>                                      /   FLEX-PAY(tm)   /        / ___// /  / __//_/_/_/ __

        HEY! It's everyone's friend, Flex-Pay! Flex-Pay makes it easy to buy 
whatever you see on the Home Shopping Club, even if you don't have enough 
money to afford it! Isn't the capitalist system great?

        Not only is there some serious savings to be had (and man, I'm 
talking SERIOUS savings, incredible values), there's DRAMA. If you happen to 
be watching Television's Gift to Life (The Home Shopping Club of course) 
during the late hours of the night, chances are a drunk old lady will call up 
to chat with the host of the program. On a good night, this might happen 
more than just a few times. Isn't that terrific?

        Well, that was a short synopsis of my opinions on the Home Shopping 
Club. After reading that you may be left with a questions. You may ask, why? 
You may ask if I spend long evenings watching and studying the way the Home 
Shopping Club is run, or if my entire speech was meant to be bitterly 
sarcastic and I actually loathe any form of home shopping, especially on the 
airwaves? You may ask how many questions I may ask? (You may not be told this 
information.) You may ask yourself, "Where does this highway go to?". You may 
ask yourself "Where is my beautiful house?", and you may ask yourself "Where 
is my beautiful wife?". You may ask youself, "Who IS Number One?" You may ask
yourself if you have done a good job recycling, and you may ask yourself 
questions on the subject of Greek Mythology. You may wonder how many licks it 
takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop, or how many pills of Prozac 
it takes to cause mental damage. You may ask, "How many roads must a man walk 
down?", or "When is the next GWAR concert?" After all, inquiring minds want 
to know. This is the information age, and we want information. Release it.
                                                                                                                  [
                                                               ¯¯ the end.
