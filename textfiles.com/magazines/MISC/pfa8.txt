        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This week's letter from Dr. Menace:

   Hello friends and associates.  I realize that I have been very
   irresponsible about releasing issues.

        Do I care?
        No.
        I DON'T GET PAID FOR THIS SHIT.

   Anyways this took a little longer.  Our first digest sized (50+
   kilobytes.) issue.  Hopefully a little practicality in this issue.

 p.s. - in this issue we have included Solctice's article in TWaT 3
 about "All the Idiots I met at Hope" in h0p3z that ewe d00dz can see
 that solctice iz k-rad and u are all a bunch of kiddiEz!  You guys are
 so lame!  U know nothing!

        AlriGht One last thing.  Right before ouR appendixes in this
        issue there iz our Sub-Zine.  It's called Criminal Behavior and
        is k-rad anarchY.  It R00lZ.

remember in our last issue, we promised to show you how to skin a cat one
armed?  I haven't actually tried this, anyone who skins a cat like this
can mail me a .GIF of it and i'll post it in our next issue. (k-k00l
d00d)

step 1: sit in your wheelchair and wait for a cat to come by
step 2: when you see a cat, pick it up by the tail, and bash it into the
        pavement until it stops struggling (alternate method: if you're strong
        enough, just strangle it one-handed)
step 3: splay the cat out in your lap, in the position shown in the last
        issue.
step 4: grip one of the legs firmly in your teeth, near the elbow, and
        grab the paw with your hand.  twist the paw firmly, until you hear
        things starting to rip inside.
step 5: spit out that killer hairball in your mouth.
step 6: repeat steps 4 and 5 on each leg.
step 7: while gripping a paw firmly in your mouth, use the claws on the
        opposing paw to shred the loose skin on that leg.
step 8: repeat on each leg.
step 9: grip a loose flap of skin firmly in your teeth, and grasp the
        cat's neck in you hand.  pull.  the skin will be ripped open into the
        cat's abdomen, and will peel easily.
step 10: repeat on each leg.
step 11: pull off any remaining skin with your teeth.
step 12: drive your wheelchair through a sprinkler to clean off the
         blood.

i haven't thought of a good way to peel the head, you're kind of on your
own as far as that goes.

now you have your very own monopeligically skinned cat

makes a great gift

        First, take two new cello strings.  Cut them down to about two
feet a piece.  Tie these into a "V."  At the intersection tie a metal
ring, an inch in diameter.  At the ends of the V tie metal balls about
the size of eggs.  Read the text below for instructions on usage:

        W3rd.  get two people butt-naked.  have them like this:

                  anus                          anus
                   |                             |
       o        o  |  o        o     o        o  |  o        o
      o          o | o          o   o          o | o          o
      o          o***o          o   o          o***o          o

       o        o     o        o     o        o     o        o


        Now, take the two metal eggs, and stick one in each persons ass
        all the way.  it should look like this from overhead:
           butts ____________
                 +       +
                 ()()    ()()

                      \/ ___ cello stringz.
                       o
Now, take the ring in one hand and play the stringz with a bow like a
cello.  don't use lube it will dampen the effectZ.

have p/h/u/n.

Ever wanted to know a cheap, dirty way to make booze? Ever had the problem of
not being 21? This takes some time, but's kind of fun and IS cheap.

1. Get a gallon of apple juice or apple cider. (Like $2.50) Make sure it
doesn't have any preservatives in it. (With the current kraze on healthly
foods, this shouldn't be hard.)
2. Get some dry yeast. Follow the instuctions on the back of the packet to
disolve it and add it to the apple juice. Instead of putting the cap of the
jug back on, put a ballon on it. (If you put the cap on, it will explode and
be very messy in a few days)
3. Put in the closet and let it sit for a few days. Check on it occationally
and let of the built up CO2.
4. When it stops bubbling, take out a cup or two, and drink it. (It should now
be about as alcoholic as beer.) Add as much sugar to the jug as you took out
in apple juice. Be very careful to add it SLOWLY, for it will react with the
yeast and may bubble over.
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 until you're satisfied or until the alcohol content gets
so high that it kills the yeast. Repeat them at least once, for good measure.
You may get the alcohol content up to 20 or 30 percent (40 or 60 proof) or
higher.

Have fun.

  okay boyzes and girlzes it's time for you to learn how to root through
  the trash.

no, not just any old trash, USEFUL trash, like hardware and infoz and
stuff like that.  a successful dumpster dive entails the following
things:

  1. don't go trashing somewhere stupid, pick a Bell office or somethign
  cool like that

  2. don't go trashing alone.  it's best to go with two people (at
  least) one to do the actual fishing, and others to keep watch for cops
  or bell employees.

  3. the best things to take are books, especially if they say things
  like "5ESS MANUAL" or "ANCIENT DRUIDIC HEXES" or something like that.

  4. another good thing to grab is things like printouts, pamphlets, and
  reports from their computers.  usually this stuff is extraneous, but
  occcasionally you'll find a diamond in the crap

  5. if you're trashing somewhere where they take credit cards (store,
  bank, etc.) grab any carbon copies you see, sometimes these have
  credit card numbers and other fun info on them.  the places are
  generally amazingly stupid about handling these.  (i.e. - not
  shredded, etc.)  you will find them in a longish black-brown plastic
  bag.  w3rd.  u can als0 find these receiptz on the ground near some
  automatic teller machines or gascard machinez.  but that'z only for
  the lethargic.  shitz.  that's a big w0rd.

  6. when trashing at a bell office, you can grab hardware, i've found
  (among others)
     - wire (don't get the mulitcolored stuff in bundlesm go for the
     heavy stuff)
     - network interface boxes (can be useful)
     - circuit breakers (they throw away unused ones, but i couldn't
     find anything much to use that size for)
     - padlocks
     - once i found something that looked like an entire switchboard
     with about 100 ports to put in wires and stuff.  was really heavy,
     so i couldn't get away with it.  i wonder what it could've been?
     don't be lame.
     - bell cans (yes, an entire can)
     - weird installation and maintenance stuff

  7. wear gloves

   8.a) if some dork comEz up 2 u whilst u r in the dumpster and says "Yo,
   r U a haqR l00k1ng for C0deZ!@@!!@!!?!!?" u can just tell him "W0rd,
   eyem am in the EPA, and we heard ewe layMOurZ dew not recycle your
   trash, and eyeM inspEctIng youR AsS fuQr!!@!@@!"
   Then he will be fear-stricken and w1ll say "D0d3 ju5t d0n't naRc us
   out or h4ng y0urs3lf from a br1dg3@!@!!!!  0ur sh1pz must pass thru!
   PleAz3 t4k3 my SS7 t3xTZ!!@@!@!@"  Then ewe say "Ok d0de h3r3 gimm3
   the teXtZ.  and Eye w1ll givE my SuperVis0r a g00D r3port on eWe."
   Then he will f33l relieved.
   8.b) w3rd, if u r lyke caught doing this, and u f33l wimpy and don't
   want to bullshit a lot, when the d00d approaches u say "W3rd, me and
   my friend lost our ball h3r3 and w3 4r3 looking for it."  (in all
   honesty, we have stooped to this level.  it workz.  but if u do it u
   r layme.  yes we are too.)

i realize that most people with the intelligent of a houseplant could
figure this out, but hey, you bothered to read this.

Showdown between Dr. Menace and Eagle_1 on 09-04-1994 at 6:50 PM PDT

It's Eagle_1, 1 small step for warez, 1 one giant leap for warez-kind.
     - Courtesy of Lord Valgamon [FRiSC] (Formerly RiSC)

        DrMenace: Hey Eagle_1...
        Eagle_1: I don't even know why you're bothering with this
        bullshit.
        DrMenace: I hear you are a very powerful person on the net, that
        one takeover of #warez could get someone TRW'd and fucked for
        life.  What do you have to say about this, mr 1?
        Eagle_1: Yeah that's not something to play around with man.
        DrMenace: Uhh ok I see.  :)  What advice would you give to a
        young courier who would like to learn about couriering the
        0-day?  For a ten bucks a month no less?
        Eagle_1: You don't pronounce it right man.  It's pronounced
        CURR-EE-ERR.
        DrMenace: Ok I understand.  But please answer my question
        motherfucker.  Don't fucking dodge my inquisitions bitch.
        Eagle_1: If you're trying to start shit here, I don't see why
        you gotta be like, ya know, what advice would I give?  I'd be
        like...umm..you gotta be consistent.  You gotta be prompt.  And
        you gotta have some kinda personal stake in it.
        Alloy: Like money?
        Eagle_1: Yeah possibly.
        DrMenace: I'm getting bored of hearing you now so I'm gonna ask
        another funny and witty question to make this a more satisfying
        magazine.  What would you think if PfA started a subnewsletter
        dedicated to curr-ee-err-ing the 0-day?
        Eagle_1: Dude do you have some kind of obsession with that
        phrase?
        DrMenace: Yes.  And you cop an attitude with me once more, and
        you are fucked bigtime buddy.  I'm going to take over RiSC!  And
        then where the fuck will you be, sweetcakes?
        Alloy: Eagle_1, if you died, would you put RiSC in your will?
        Yo Eagle_1 you've got the ball in your court dude.
        DrMenace: Yeah dude, we like put the ball in your court, and
        like dude, you are just like dropping the ball dude!
        Eagle_1: You're the one without the balls, Menace.
        DrMenace: That was very witty!
        Alloy (In a hushed voice.): Credit for witness.
        DrMenace: Have you a yak?
        Eagle_1: Have I a what?
        DrMenace: Nevermind.  You obviously have a very mundane sense of
        humor.  Lighten up.
        Valgamon: What do you expect from a guy who is the single most
        powerful warez d00d in the world.  In our solar system even!
        DrMenace: I have heard rumors of a merging between the Humble
        Slaves, for those of you who don't know, they curr-ee-err the 0-day
        for THG, and RiSC.  Is this true?
        Eagle_1: I don't know where you're getting this from.
        DrMenace: Eagle_1, do you have any idea whatsoever, when you are
        being fucked with?  And what the hell are all you lamers doing
        on my fucking bridge?!?!?
        Eagle_1: I think you're a fucking idiot first of all, because,
        no one's gonna read this bullshit.  Fucking idiot (Whispered.)
        DrMenace: I don't think Eagle_1 is paying his respects to us.  I
        think he is now doomed.  He is #1 on our Doomed List, with his
        name underlined, highlighted in pink, with quotes, brackets, and
        parentheses around it, bordered with asterisks, with carrot
        signs underneath it, and a big frowny face next to it.  I think
        he is fucked.
        Valgamon: Umm.  That's pretty cool.  Huhuhuhuhuh.
        Eagle_1: Fuck this, I'm hanging up.
        DrMenace: Before you go will you say "I don't have time for you
        lamers?"
        Eagle_1: Yeah whatever you say.

Then Phaser-X called him again.

        Eagle_1: Oh no, not this asshole again!
        DrMenace: Word, what's up Eagle_1, I didn't finish my exclusive
        interview.
        Eagle_1: Shut up.  Fucking reporter.  Ugh.

He wasn't much fun that time.

                     All the idiots I met at HoPE [[or: everybody was lame
                                By Solctice         except for me.]]

I met about 200 people at HoPE many being from IRC..many not...there were many
gimps, and there were many cool people. I took many pictures, and I am
digitizing all of the peoples pictures that I met. I am explaining all the
people I met concering #phreak/#hack.  I am doing this for neither prestige
nor popularity.  [[that would be futile.]] Just for the fun of it, and top
shut you lame ass fuckers up who keep asking me about people I met.

Note From The Author: all the .gifs will be here in a few weeks...I sent
them out on Monday, August 15th, by FedEx. They'll be here in a maxzimum of
two weeks.
============================================================================
Music Phreak:  He was the first person I met at HoPE, for we were the first
few people there.  I expected him to be a short italian, but he was a tall,
massive guy with the temper of a dandelion.  [[sounds like solctice has
some affections for this guy.]] Real nice guy. Definately on my list of cool
people.

PMF: He was one of the few people who fit my expectations of the person they
were.  I had met him on confs months before,  and he knew his shit.  To put
it all in words, he was troll-like, for he was short with flashy clothes.
But nonetheless, he was not ugly, or stupid, or gimp-like [[does anybody
else notice how much he uses the word gimp?  eye think british tv should
be censored.]] at all.  One of my more favorite people at the conf.
[[con, dammit, it's a CONVENTION.]] Despite his constant swearing in public
and never ending wise cracks and pranks,  I could safely say he was one of
the coolest people I met at HoPE.

Pluvius:  Pluvius was not at all what I expected. I expected him to be a loud,
stupid looking person.  He was not. He was a tall, quiet type with Army boots
and a short haircut.  [[and when he held me i felt very s4f3.]] If he said 10
words to me at HoPE, it was a lot.  Not that he didn't like me and the group
I was with, it was he is just a quiet person. [[he just found me
irritating and didn't want to be around me.]] DEFINATELY not the gimp like
person I thought I'd meet.  Most Unix gurus *AREN'T* normal.  Ploov gets mah
Warez Of Approval.  [[i'm sure that means a lot to him.]]

Parad0x:  On confs, I had always thought of parad0x as a chink. He was a pure
down-home American white-boy.  If I get 50 questions about Parad0x a day, it's
a slow day.  To put it in words, he looked *almost* normal. Aside from being
about 6'2", about 160 pounds, [[normal?  that's GUMBY!]] having absolutely no
muscle what-so-ever, [[but i have come to love him for his mind.]] and having
a goofy, non haqr-looking face, he seemed normal. I came to HoPE knowing I
was going to kick the shit out of this immature kiddie if he such as even
LOOKED at me sideways, I did nothing of the sort when I met him, for he seemed
like a nice guy.  He wasn't staying at the conf, because his mommy wouldn't let
him stay with all the evil haqr people.  That night, he was 150 miles away, and
started talking shit about me on IRC about me being a fat gimp. Neither of
which I am. I regretted not making this little kiddie swallow his teeth.
There's always next year. This kiddie getz the Parad0x Seal of
Gimpiness.  [[alright, let's keep a tab, how many times can someone use
the word "gimp" in one fucking article.]]

Lestat(Razor): I had heard much about this kid from confs, and have been on a
few of them with him. If you ever get the misfortune of being on a conf with
this kid, hang up.  He's a toner, a breather, and lame in general. I had heard
about him being short and fat, and looking like a girl, but the latter two of
which he was neither.  He wasn't what I expected, and the few times that I saw
him at HoPE, he was normal....drunk off his ass, but normal.  he *IS* short,
and he *IS* very rich. [[but solctice, aren't u rich from your daddy'z
meat packing plant?]]  Finally, I took many pictures of this kid, because it
was fun, and I had a massive demand to do so.  This annoyed him. When he
passed out from over consumption of beer and Zima (eew..Zima), I started to
kick him, wanting to see his reaction. He promply sat up and hit his head on
the underside of the table, knocking him back out...haha. I could neither
define him as a gimp [[there's that FUCKING word again.]] or a normal person,
for he fit neither catergory fully.  [[and becuz i don't know any normal
people to compare him to.]]

BBS HaCkinG - Some ClaSSic TipZ.

 *************************
    WRITTEN BY Pyr0t3ch
 *************************
 *************************



 1.0  FINDING A BBS TO ABUSE.

                TO FIND A BBS TO ABUSE LOOK AT THE BOARD AND THE
        SYSOP OR USERS, LOOK FOR THESE TYPE OF THINGS,

    A, LOOK FOR A SYSOP WHICH TRYS MAKING OUT THAT HIS BBS IS THE BEST AND
       ALWAYS MAKES MILLIONS OF MESSAGES ON OTHER BOARDS SHOWING WHAT HE'S
       GOT LIKE "PHONE THE BEST BBS" THEY ARE THE TYPE FO ASSHOLES, GO FOR
       THEM..

    B, LOOK AT THE BBS, IF IT'S A TYPE OF BBS WHICH HAS NOTHING, LIKE THE
       BBS IS RUNNING ON A 9600 BAUD AND 80 MEG HD BUT HAS LESS FILES THEN
       WHAT YOU ERASE EACH DAY, THEY SHOULD BE HIT GOOD.

    C: GO FOR A BBS WHICH YOU KNOW THAT THE SYSOP THERE DOESN'T KNOW
       YOU OR YOU NEVER REALLY PHONE THERE, IT'S BETTER FOR NOT BEING
       CAUGHT, THIS METHOD IS ONLY USED IF YOU ARE GOING TO ABUSE FOR
       NO REASON OF ALL.

    D, FIND A BBS WHICH THE SYSOP HAS A FEW ENERMIES BUT NOT YOU. HE'LL
       THINK IT'S YOU.

    E, FIND A BBS WITH GOOD ACCESS ON FIRST LOG ON, THE TYPE THAT LETS YOU
       HAVE MESSAGE ACCESS. THEY ARE LOSERS TO ALLOW YOU TO HAVE SUCH
       ACCESS, UNLESS IT'S A GOOD BBS LIKE THRASHER..

    F, FIND A BBS WHICH IS THE MOST HARDEST TO USE, NO ONE LIKES THOSE
       BOARDS.

    G, FIND A BBS WITH A YOUNG SYSOP FROM AGE 13-15, THEY DON'T BOTHER
       COMPLAINLING TO THE PARENTS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY TEND TO SAY,
       THEN HAVE YOUR LINE OUT, ADULT SYSOPS ARE MOSTLY MORE ASSHOLES.
       THEY'LL PROBABLY PHONE YOU VOICE TO COMPLAIN..

    H, FIND A BBS WHICH PIRATES, THAT WAY YOU CAN SCARE THE HELL OUT OF THEM
       BY SAYING THINGS LIKE, I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS. THEY TEND TO
       FEAR SUCH HASSELMENTS BECAUSE PIRATING IS A MAJOR CRIME.

    J, FIND A BBS THAT ALLOWS ALAISES, IT'S HARD TO FIND OUT WHO'S WHO AND
       IMPOSSIBLE TO VALIDATE PEOPLE. THEY TEND TO GO NON-ALAIS AFTER A
       WHILE OF PROBLEMS BUT THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO'S PRANKING.

    K, FIND A BBS WHICH HAS ECHO OR NET MAIL, GET ACCESS TO FULL AREAS,
       YOU CAN SCREW ABOUT IN ECHO MAIL AND IT'S HARD TO ERASE IT,
       IN TIME IT'LL TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY IF IT'S A WORLD ECHO BASE.

    L, FIND A BBS WITH A AREA THAT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO UPLOAD ON FIRST LOG
       ON.

    M, FIND A SYSOP WHICH DOESN'T VALIDATE USERS.

    N, FIND A BBS WHICH IS VERY POPULAR, THE SYSOP TENDS TO HAVE TO MUCH
       ON HIS MIND TO VOICE CALL.

    O, FIND A BBS WHICH THE SYSOP ISN'T AORUND ALOT,



       THOSE ARE SOMETHINGS TO TAKE IN MIND. NOW LETS MOVE INTO
       THE GOOD STUFF.



 1.1  IF YOU LOG ON, USE A ALAIS, MAKE IT GOOD BUT NOT TO STUPID, NAMES
      LIKE "FUCK FUCK" "SHITHEAD" AIN'T GOD ABUSERS, USER SOME OF THE
      FOLLOWING.

                        DR. ABUSER
                        IT'S_YOUR TURN
                        THE PUNISHER
                        THE ABUSER
                        TOUGH LUCK
                        FALCON
                        THE COPS
                        BOARD ABUSERS
                        YOUR DEAD
                        TRASHER MASTER
                        THE VIRUS
                        KILLING YOU
                        RICHARD LITTLE
                        THE DEIVIL
                        ABUSE YOU

   THOSE AIN'T TOO GOOD BUT YOU GET SOME IDEAS.

1.2 LOG ON, IF YOU GET ON USING THAT TYPE OF NAME THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
    IF THE SYSOP IS WATCHING, EITHER THEY'LL HANG UP AND LOCK YOU OUT
    OR BREAK IN FOR CHAT, IF THEY BREAK IN FOR A CHAT, HEARS SOME IDEAS
    WHICH YOU CAN SAY.

        1, I'M BUSY, FUCK OFF
        2, I'M GOING TO TRASH YOU BAD!
        3, LET ME OUT I HAVE ABUSING TO DO!
        4, I HAVE TO CRASH YOUR BOARD NOW, SORRY, UNOIN RULES!
        5, CAN I HELP YOU!
        6, CAN YOU GIVE ME SYSOP ACCESS
        7, WANT TO TRY A NEW VIRUS A MADE.

    SURE, MOST OF THOSE ARE SMART REMARKS, BUT YOU CAN'T PLAY DUMB, LET THEM
    KNOW WHAT YOU ARE UP TOO, IT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE PISSED.


1.3 IF THEY HANG UP, JUST PHONE BACK WITH ANOTHER NAME, IF YOU WANT TO CHAT
    WITH THEM WHEN YOU PHONE BACK, WHEN IT ASKS FOR YOUR NAME, TYPE THESE:

        1, CHAT. I KNOW YOU ARE WATCHING.
        2, HELP! THERE'S A KILLER IN MY HOUSE
        3, HELLO, THIS ISN'T THAT GUY THAT WAS JUST ON
        4, ARE YOU THERE, FUCK OFF
        5, DON'T BOTHER ME AND LET ME ON.
        6, YOU BBS HANGED UP ON ME! IT'S BROKEN
        7, I'M UPLOADING A VIRUS WHICH YOU ARE WATCHING.

     THOSE ARE STILL STUPID REMARKS, BUT HEY! THE SYSOP ISN'T PLEASED.

1.4 IF YOU MADE IT ON THE BBS THE FIRST TIME AND THE SYSOP HASN'T
    NOTICED YOU BECAUSE HE ISN'T AROUND, LOOK AT YOUR ACCESS OPIONS.
    IF THEY HAVE A BBS LISTER, AND YOU CAN GET IN IT, DO SO.

     CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE BBS, SIMPLE DISPLAY.

      REALLY NAMES            -   NOW CHANGED NAMES
   ----------------------------------------------------------
    Rock Blaster BBS          -  Bumb blaster BBS
    Kings corner BBS          -  Kings cocker
    Jerrys out house          -  Jerry's house is out
    All nite shift            -  All nite shitting

     Bad examples but I'm not thinking at the moment.
      Anyways change the sysop names, Number, City and so forth.


1.4  If you want to sit for a few hours, If you have access to a message
     area, Then toally mess it up, Leave mail to people saying things
     like this:


        1, HOW CAN YOU BE A PART OF THE SHIT BBS
        2, AIN'T YOU IN THAT FAG CONTEST
        3, FUCK OF, THAT MESSAGE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
        4, GO TO HELL,

          If you are able to leave mail using alaises, Look at user or the
          SysOp's name, Try leaving mail to some one by copying their name
          with a slight change. LIKE THIS.

                FRANK WILLAND  -- FRANK WILAND
                DON BLUTHE     -- DON BLUTH

          OR USE THE NAME "THE SYSOP"

                LEAVE A MESSAGE LIKE, FUCK OFF, YOU AIN'T WANTED AT THIS
                BBS.

1.5  THERE ARE TIMES THAT I'VE LOGGED ON A FEW BOARDS WHICH GIVE ONLINE GAMES
     ACCESS, TRY HANGING UP IN THEM. THAT MAY HANG THE BBS.

1.6 FINALLY, LEAVE MORE THEN 30 PEICES OF MAIL TO THE SYSOP GIVING MESSAGES
    LIKE.
                I'LL BE BACK TO FINISH MY JOB.
                YOU AIN'T SEEN THE LAST OF ME.
                YOU TERMINATED NEXT TIME.
                I'VE TRAHSED  ENOUGH OF YOU BBS FOR TODAY.
                YOU ARE A FUCKING LOSER!

1.7 PHONE BACK EVERY DAY FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS, MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU
    THAT WELL AND HE'S GOING TO BE PARANOID EVERYTIME SOEONE LOGS ON..




2.0  MOVING TO OTHER WAYS OF ABUSING IS MAKING A GOOD VIRUS, THOUGH I WILL
     NOT SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A VIRUS I'LL GIVE YOU THE BEST WAY TO MAKE
     SOME ONE RUN IT.
                1, FIND A GAME PEOPLE ARE CRAZING FOR, PIRATED MOSTLY.
                2, MAKE THE VIRUS AND CHANGE THE NAME TO THE NAME OF
                   THE GAME, MAKE SURE YOU MAKE IT CODED ABIT, LKE
                   DAK.EXE, NOT STREETFIGHTER.EXE, MOST PIRATED GAMES
                   DON'T HAVE THAT.
                3, THEN MAKE ABOUT 20 OTHER FILES RELATED TO SUCH A GAME.
                4, THEN ZIP THEM UP AND THE VIRUS WILL LOOK LIKE IT'S
                   A ZIPPED GAME AND ONLY YOU WILL KNOW OF IT AS A VIRUS.
                5, THEN UPLOAD AND IF THE GAME IS THAT POPLUAR, IT'LL BE
                   DOWNLOADED ALOT WITHIN THE WEEK, EVEN THE SYSOP WILL
                   RUN IT, HE'LL FIRST PORBALBY TAKE IT OFF THE FILE LIST
                   KNOWING IT'S PIRATED THEN TRY IT OUT.


2.1 ANOTHER THING IS TO HAVE MORE THEN 3 OR MORE ACCOUNTS ON A BBS.
    USE NORMAL NAMES LIKE JASON SMITH, AND GET VALIDATED ON ALL
    ACCOUNTS, YOU MAY UPLOAD TONS OF VIRUSES TILL THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
    WRONG, ABOUT 5 ACCOUNTS MAY PUT ABOUT 100 VIRUSES IN A WEEK, AND
    CRASH LOTS OF COMPUTERS, IT'LL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE SYSOP TO FIGURE
    OUT THAT ALL UPLOADS CONTAINING THE NAMES OF THE UPLOADERS AND WHEN
    HE TRYS LOOKING FOR YOU TO ASK IF YOU DID IT INTENDLY, YOU WON'T HAVE
    YOU REALLY PHONE NUMBER, YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE IT ISN'T YOURS.

2.2 IF YOU GET FULL ACCESS, FIND OUT WHEN THE ECHO MAIL GETS SENT OUT ALL
    OVER MOST OF THE CITY OF STATE. THEN WRITE MILLIONS OF UNNESSARY
    MESSAGES ABOUT ALMOST ANY TOPIC, BEST IS TO WRITE ABOUT KNOWN PIRATE
    BOARDS, THIS WAY IT'LL BE SENT AROUND THE STATE AND POLICE DO READ
    THESE MESSAGES AND SO OR LATER THERE'LL BE MAJOR PROBLEM.

2.3 ALSO, IT'S HARD BUT THERE MAYBE A TIME TO GET AHOLD OF SOMEONES PWORD.
    TRY FINDING SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW AND ASK FOR THE USER LIST AND PWORDS.
    AND THEN USE THEM ON OTHER BOARDS, MOST PEOPEL STICK WITH THE SAME
    PASSWORD. YOU CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING FROM POSTIN ECHO MESSAGES, UPLOADING
    VIRUSES AND ABUSING THE BBS.

2.4 WRITE MESSAGES ON THIGNS THAT CAN REFLICT MANY PEOPLE, SAY THAT THERE'S
    A VIRUS WITH A TYPE OF TIME BOMB ON IT, IT'LL GO OF WITHIN 2 MONTHS
    AND THE VIRUS STARTED ON A BBS FILE AREA AND MOST FILES FORM THAT BBS
    ARE INFECTED. IT'LL TURN HEADS REALLY FAST, ALSO POST MESSAGES LIKE
    THERE'S A RUMOUR THAT A SYSOP ON ANOTHER BBS IS RUNNING AN ABUSING SECTION
    AND HAS OVER 200 ZIP UP VIRUSES THAT RUN BY THE .EXE, IT'LL AGAIN CAUSE
    PROBLEM...


2.5 TRY LOADING A GAME AND TYPING A CODE LIKE "[2][/4][SHELL][TO][DOS]
    IF THE SYSOP IS WATCHING YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW SOMETIHNG BAD!

RE: Tried Chatting

You need to like get more active person...  Like how do you feel about guns?
 You know that they are about to pass a bill that will ban 18 (but in
actuallity 150) "Assult Rifles"?  They put it in the crime bill and then on
tuesday they went ahead and pulled it out.. Well last night they threw it bacj
 in just before the vote today.  I think you should really start getting
worried..  Part of the health plan requires that everyone be in a Federal
Database that will require to know all about you and your doctor and what
problems you have where you live and what you eat and the area you live in and
this computer system will be open to a vague amount of people.  You stop and
think about it and you realize that it makes it real easy to impose martial
law on people or make them "dissapear" when you know everything about them.
Also the nazi's thought the white race was superior.  so they killed off lots
off people who  didn't fit the bill..  Hmm think about how easy it would be to
make up a list of criterias that people had to meet and then run them on that
database.. Gee an instant list of all your "enemies".  This goverment is
really getting scary.  I don't know.. you can ignore it if you want but I
don't think it will be too long before they start coming to get people.. Yeah
so they shot down the Clipper Chip but I'm sure that they would still like to
keep an eye on us.. You know you could be taken away for haveing the
subversive stuff you have on here.. I know it sounds stupid but it really
looks like it is going to escalate to that point in the future...  I know that
if they get this data base going that sucker is gonna go down if I have
anyting to do with it... I think you should look at some of this shit.. The
clintons are soooo much the Socialists..  Just think about it man,  then go
ahead and dismiss me as a kook but if the guns going don't bother you then
realize that your computer could become a threat to the goverment and Kapoof..
It's gone.. Oh well I sound like a nut but it's true so latere bud....

                                     MEMO


    To:   Randall Moore
    From: Scot Kelly
    Date: August 14, 1991
    Re:   Recent Telephone Conversations with Debbie Patel


    A. Debbie said that her group and the Applied Research group at
    Bellcore had reservations about treating non-alphanumerics as
    valid word characters.  They are listed below with the response
    I gave to her.

        1. D:User's will not know which characters are valid if
             books are prepared with differing character sets.

           S:By allowing non-alphanumerics to be treated as valid
             word characters, we have a much more flexible system.
             It becomes the System Administer's responsibility to
             create a consistent set of documents.  If they fail
             to do so, it is not a Bellcore bug.

        2. D:Users searching for '100' will not find '100%' or
             '$100'.

           S:Correct, as these words are distinctly different.
             If a person wants all instances, they can use an
             OR query.  If they aren't aware of the other
             instances, they can use '100*' as a query and the
             Wildcard Matches window that follows to verify.
             This inconvenience is by far out weighed by the
             ability to search for '100%' without having to
             search through all instances of '100'.


    B.  Debbie said it won't be difficult to modify mkbook & BE so
    that they accept characters with decimal values greater than 127
    (i.e.: line draw characters).  The current mkbook has a filter for
    these characters, because a few of them cause problems for the
    mkbook algoirithm (0) or for most monitors (CR, LF). We discussed
    adding a command line option to turn off the filtering for all but
    these few characters.
        She was concerned that books with these characters would not be
    viewable from any other than PC monitors, thus preventing us from
    reaching our goal of a platform independent architecture.
        I said that our environment was entirely PCs, and if non-PC'c
    are used in future, we can always go back to the current process.
    In all, the improvement to the readability of the document meritted
    a deviation from our philosophy.


    C.  Debbie said that even with these reservations, Bellcore was
    willing to go ahead and make the changes if we really wanted them.

    Re:   Specification for 4.1 transaction



    Transaction specification needs to be ammended as follows:

    Transaction Body Definitions:

      ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¬ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
      ≥ T_PBmatches_wl ≥ 1022 ≥ context ≥ lookup_block ≥
      ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¡ƒƒƒƒƒƒ¡ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¡ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ



    Transaction Descriptions:

      Given a lookup query, this transaction returns a formatted list of
      words that were found that match the query.



    More explicitly:

      This transaction has two parts: creating a string, then storing that
      string in several lines of fixed length.

      The string is equivalent to the lookup query if no stems or aliases
      are involved.  Word order is preserved.  Comma and space operators
      are preserved.

      The characters 'Found: ' are prepended to the string.

      Gaps with multiple spaces are reduced to a single space.

      If the lookup query contains a stem, then the stem is replaced by a
      comma seperated list of all the words matching the stem.

      If the lookup query contains a word with aliases, these aliases
      appear immediately after the word, (prior to comma operator if present),
      as a comma seperated list of words enclosed within square brackets.

      Note: This transaction will be affected if aliasing is ever enabled
      for queries that contain stems.

      Note: This transaction will be affected if nesting of operators is
      ever supported.

      As for storing the string in lines of fixed length, this transaction
      behaves much as 1020, breaking the string if necessary at gaps between
      words.

      For unspecified details, see transaction 1020.

Appendix A - PfA BBS List Information.

 If run a hacker related Bulletin Board System, and are willing to carry
 the PfA issues, perhaps you would like to publicize your board to the
 appropriate crowd.  If so, call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback
 to Dr. Menace or Angel of Death telling us the name, number and NuP (if
 any) of your BBS.  Thanx!

  Current BBS List:

----------------------------------------

Appendix A - Submitting articles to PfA

 If you have read PfA, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are
 of the appropriate genre.  Thanx!

----------------------------------------

Appendix B - Receiving copies of PfA

 The best way to receive PfA is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at PfA realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current PfA issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of PfA,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....financially and otherwise.
----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and me.  Here they
 are:

 1) BBS: The Escapade Macabre, (206)565-0786.  A WWiV BBS run by Dr.
 Menace and Angel of Death.  We can both be contacted there.

 2) Internet: We can be reached by InterNet.  Dr. Menace is
 neuman@hebron.connected.com, and Angel of Death is
 craig@hebron.connected.com.

 3) IRC: We are occasionally found on our IRC channel...probably on
 Weekends.  We have this totally worked out, the channel name is
 "#SoLo/PfA"...

 Any form of E-Mail is acceptable for submitting articles, just make
 sure you make you include the author, and subject of the article.
----------------------------------------

Have fun guyz!
