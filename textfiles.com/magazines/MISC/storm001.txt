                           The After Effects

        Well, as thinking about the previous tfile, there was a lot of
stuff that i wanted to add to it...I chose not to do that because then
you people might not have read that one being that it was too lond or
something...maybe you didn't read the whole file but either way, i won't
know about it...anyway, if you were too lazy to read the previous file,
you didn't miss too much...it was written VERY early in the morning and
i was VERY tired and there are a lot of spelling mistakes and it was
just very basic, not too much to it...this one is a little more serious
in that it involves money and stuff i wanna sell and some more general
chatter about not too much...i sorta like doing this, this tfile
writing, it's not too hard to do and i you don't have to be a genius to
write one that people will read...in any case, this one is less
piontless than the other...well, here i go.....

        You may be wondering why i even attempted to write these, well,
i had no choice...see, i only have one modem, and it is inside of my
father's 386/40 so we can d/l while doing something else...his computer
has been doing some strange things lately...windows seems not to boot
anymore cuz it said that a file in config was corrupt, we checked it out
and all of the drivers that get loaded seemed fine, then the mouse
driver won't work and windows is saying that there is not enough memory
 to do certain tasks when there is plenty (eight megs)...i suspected
some kind of virus, so naturally i ran CPAV...nothing...but our version
is also one year old, so my father will get the new updates on monday
from work...anyway, cpav said that config sys was changed but we have
changed it since that last time we ran cpav so there is no prob
there...anyway, i didn't want to use the computer for fear that i would
spread it if i ran anything (isreali does that)...i also did not want to
move the modem into my romm on my little 286 12 (that i wanna sell)
because people always call my line and i have call waiting on that
line...so, out of sheer BOREDOM. i decided to write something...and
thus, STORM was born...

        Now that that is out of the way, let's get down to a business
level...i have a Commodore 64c for sale and i want to sell ALL of my
accessories, books, games and all of the stuff that even reminds me of
the computer...it is a great entry level computer equipped with basic 2
(wow) and all kinds of stuff...it's great for starting proggramers and
for the avid game player...i have shitloads of games for it so you will
be very busy...ok, here are the prices...

        Well, i hope that somebody out there will want this damn
computer!  I haven't used that Commie for a long time...It's collecting
dust here...i hope somebody will get some more use out of it, i've used
it alot...

        I also have an IBM computer for sale, not a whole system but
most of the vital parts...here it is...

        IBM compatible 286/12mhz motherboard with 1meg of expanded
memory on board SIMM chips, case w/ power suply, game card, 1.44meg
floppy drive = $220
                 w/ hercules grafix/printer card = $240
                 w/ Peanut VGA 640x480x256c card = $260

        I've used this computer to its limit...i am writing this on it
right now...this computer is a great entry level computer for first
getting into the IBM compatible family of computers...DOS 5.0, Windows
3.1 and XtreeGold can be made available to you on disk but unfortunatly,
i will have to charge $1.00 per 1.44 disk to cover the cost of the
disks, in other words, you are sorta getting it for free...i can also
give you any software i have for one dollar a disk...i have MANY
utilities and games that you may be interested in...

        Ok, now it is time for me to tell you what *I* want!  I am in
need of several things...

 9600 baud v.32bis modem, any kind just as long as it is at least 9600!
            4meg simm chips for my 386 (hopefully Tal!  <g>)
                            Keyboard, cheap
                          Floppy drives, cheap
                           Hard drive, cheap
                            SVGA card, cheap
                 Mouse and mouse card w/ drivers, cheap

        That's about it for now, I hope this file isn't too sloppy, i'm
kinda new to this whole thing...

        Again, if anybody knows of a group, like a tfile group or a
programing group or any type or computer user group that is in need of
members or can just help me out, LET ME KNOW!  I need more experience in
this type of work, i know that the best way to learn is to do it
yourself but i could use some assistance...i don't have too much else to
say...i would like to use some ansi or even just ascii in these files,
they are kinda boring to look at...blah, i'll be writing again sometime,
i should be on the boards again, monday night...i'll upload them
then...i am also going to send in my Cyber Chat money moday (YAY!
YIPIE!  HOORAH!)...yes, you heard me correctly, i'm actually gonna have
a paid account on C/C!  Oh, well, see you all monday night...
