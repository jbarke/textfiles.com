      HBO CONFIRMS CONTINUED ANALOG EAST & WEST COAST FEEDS FOR DISH OWNERS

      HERE'S THE CURRENT WILD FEEDS LIST - BUT NO GUARANTEES

      WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE HOME DISH SKYS THIS MONTH...

Ё    HBO CONFIRMS CONTINUED ANALOG EAST & WEST COAST FEEDS FOR DISH OWNERS    Ё
юддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддды

    HBO has confirmed that home dish owners (and cable systems) will be able to
continue receiving the analog east and west coast programming feeds for "some"
time to come and this is thought to mean at least two years - probably three
years at a bare minimum.  HBO has also confirmed that their MULTIPLEX feeds
which are not intended for home dish owners, will continue as long as there is
a need for these by cable systems.  It is thought that these feeds will
continue on Telstar 302 until it is replaced early next year but HBO refuses
to confirm this.  The multiplex feeds are now being transmitted on Galaxy 1 #18
and cable systems are being provided free Digiciphers in order to pick-up these
feeds and feed them to their subscribers.  There appears to be less than ten
cable systems in the country that are carrying these additional feeds.

    With the arrival of Digicipher set top units for cable subscribers in a
month or two, it is thought that many cable systems will take that opportunity
to add HBO2, HBO3, and CINEMAX2 on their existing HBO channel.  All that would
be required is for their subscribers to pickup the new set top unit.

    It will be a "wait and see" for a few months to find out how well this new
transmission works out in the real world - it works fine under controlled tests
but that may not be true on many of the cable systems.  If it DOES work okay,
it won't take too long for "everybody" to jump on the bandwagon and compress
their signals.

    The question is, who is "everybody"?  Here's a list of programmers who have
already announced their plans to launch additional channels as soon as the
technology proves itself.  Remember, adding a second or third channel won't
cost them anything using Digicipher, it simply allows them to charge more money
for the additional services or keep their existing subscribers happy by adding
alternative programming.

    HOME BOX OFFICE: already added two channels
    HBO CINEMAX: already added one channel
    DISNEY CHANNEL: already added one channel
    SHOWTIME: already added one channel
    E.S.P.N.: plans to add two channels
    ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT: plans to add at least one channel, maybe two
    C.N.B.C.: plans to add a second channel
    COURT TV: plans to add a second channel
    MUSIC TV(MTV): plans to add at least eight channels, maybe ten
    DISCOVERY CHANNEL: plans to add two channels
    MIND EXTENTION UNIVERSITY: plans four channels
    MADISON SQUARE GARDEN: plans to add at least one channel, maybe two
    P.B.S.: plans to expand to eight channels
    PLAYBOY CHANNEL: plans to add a second channel
    AMERICAN MOVIE CLASSICS: plans to add a second channel
    NICKELODEON: possibly two or three new services
    REQUEST PAY-PER-VIEW: plans to move to ten channels
    VIEWER'S CHOICE PAY-PER-VIEW: plans to add several new channels

    How soon will these channels be available?  We'll have to wait and see.  If
the programmers were real smart, every one would add a second channel that just
carried their program listings.  The lack of adequate listings is one of the
major complaints of cable subscribers and dish owners alike.  It is also a good
bet that every network that only has one feed will add a second alternative
time zone feed.

    Do you need to rush out and buy yourself a Digicipher?  No, for the next
year or so everyone is going to continue using videocipher.  After a year or
so we'll know how well the compression systems work and we'll know which system
will really be the "defacto" standard.  At least GI finally broke down and got
a license so their Digiciphers do have true digital Dolby sound.  Another year
or two and they may have a lot of other improvements too.

Ё   FCC ASKS FOR COMMENTS: ON HOME SHOPPING NETWORKS & CABLE READY HARDWARE   Ё
юддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддддды

    The FCC needs public comment - THAT'S YOUR OPINION - on a couple of issues
upon which, they are now planning to adopt new rules.  This is your chance to
tell the regulators how you feel.

    One, they want to know if over-the-air broadcast stations that do nothing
but carry home shopping networks actually serve the public interest and should
therefor be required to be carried by your local cable tv system.  If they do
not serve the public interest, should the FCC force cable systems to carry
these channels?  Or, should the FCC order the channels to begin carrying
programming that responds to the needs of their community the same way other
broadcast stations do?  The FCC wants to know and I'm sure you have something
to say on this so let them know.

    And, second, they want to know what to do about the problem of many cable
systems that have purposely prevented cable subscribers from being able to use
expensive cable ready hardware.  What sort of rules should be adopted in regard
to this to assure cable ready hardware owners that they can enjoy the benefits
they paid for.

    For those of you who may not have cable or cable-ready tv's and vcr's and
don't know what's going on, there is a considerable problem with using cable
ready tv's and vcr's on many cable systems.

    While the actual cable ready tv's and vcr's are usually capable of
receiving ALL normal cable tv channels, many cable systems have defeated their
use by scrambling all or part of the channels and then requiring subscribers to
rent worthless equipment simply to increase their monthly charges.

    In most cases, the worthless equipment consists of convertors to tune-in
channels instead of allowing the cable ready tv's and vcr's to do this.  In
some cases the systems have scrambled many of their channels and refuse to
"block-descramble" them (which they can easily and cheaply do outside the home)
and force subscribers to use the "cable box" to do this.  This means that a
typical cable subscriber with three tv's and a vcr - all cable-ready - must
rent four "cable boxes" for around $20. per month instead of using the stuff he
already owns for free.  Many cable systems such as Warner Cable in this area,
also rent you the remote that goes with their "cable box" for an additional fee
of $2.50 per month.  That's $5. per month for the box plus another $2.50 for
the remote.  And, if you choose not to pay for the remote, they program the
box not to accept any signals from those "universal" remotes so you can't buy
one of those and save a couple of bucks either.

    If you have something to say about this now is the time to say it.  The FCC
wants to hear from you so here's your chance.  You'll have to invest an hour or
so of your time but you'll feel better after you've expressed your opinion.

    Usually, to submit information to the FCC requires that you submit it in a
specific format that they have designated with docket numbers, cover sheets,
and footnotes.  If you desire to submit comments and are not familiar with this
process, AND you can do it in a couple of clear, consise, and SHORT paragraphs
on a single page... do it that way.  Then title it at the top of the page as
PUBLIC COMMENTS: PROPOSED CABLE-READY COMPATABILITY RULES or
PUBLIC COMMENTS: PROPOSED HOME SHOPPING BROADCASTER MUST-CARRY RULES.  If you
want to comment on both it will take to separate filings.

    What's a wildfeed?  This is a feed that is transmitted on a regular basis
(usually, it's regular) and you can tune-in if you know where and when to look
for it.  All of the syndicated programming that you see on tv stations around
the country are sent early and taped by the various stations for later
broadcasts.  This allows them to have the feed re-transmitted in case something
goes wrong with the tape or the transmission.  Most daily and weekly shows are
sent at the same time each day or each week and dish owners soon learn to watch
for these and record their locations.  That's why we now have this list.  It is
updated on a regular basis.  I'll make a habit of including it here at least
every 90 days so you should always be able to find something good to watch even
though you don't own a descrambler.  None of these feeds are encrypted.

NOTE #1: This is a specially prepared CNN Headlines news feed for
         use by American Airlines.  They never report plane crashes.

[gang]:  This means that they feed a week's worth of shows, one
         right after another.

MAYBE:   This is a place where this particular feed MAY BE found and
         then again, it might not be there.  Usually, a few minutes
         before a feed, a test pattern will appear at the location
         where the feed will be transmitted and you should tune-in
         early to see if its really there.  If something else is
         already in progress there, check back at its conclusion.  A
         feed may move around without any notice and you're not a
         authorized receive point - so they don't tell you - and
         they will move feeds just so you can't find them.

later than August, 1993.  There should be an official announcement this next

membership in their SCI-FI Fan Alliance is $25 and the SCI-FI CHANNEL Magazine

    CNBC, the Consumer News & Business Channel has put Tom Snyder on weeknights
at 9PM (CST).  Tom is in Los Angeles and CNBC is in New York, so they are
feeding Tom live from LA to NY on Telstar 301 #1.  At least that's where I have
found him.
