She is a model, and her movements are fluid,   without cessation. The effect is that she always seems to be   moving. One movement becomes the next.  "But I thought that -- " I start, but I can't think of what to   say. We are in the diner on Ninth, doing what we always do   afterward. Having lunch. What can I say?  "That I'd wait for you?"  "That you _were_ waiting for me," I say leaning forward and   trying to look at her. I have long since learned the   difficulties in dating a very beautiful woman. Looking her in   the eye is difficult at best.  Liona takes a bite of her fish and says, "Rey, you're sweet, and   I'm glad you've finally made some decisions about Audra, but I'm   not going to be monogamous with you."  I push the mashed potatoes around on my plate. The mashed   potatoes I can look at. Homemade with lumps. The brown gravy is   a mix, too silky not to be. "It doesn't sound like you have   been," I say.  "No," she says and laughs, "but neither have you, if you think   about it. Regardless, I'm not going to marry you, so there's no   point in it." Then she adds, "This fish is delicious."  "Why not? We're good together," I say and manage to take a good   look at her. Like always, I want to stare.  "No, Rey, we're fun together."  "Exactly," I say. She is wearing a baseball cap and T-shirt and   jeans. Her informal dress helps. When she is dressed, I mean   _really_ dressed, it's like standing next to a person in a   spotlight. Everyone sees you, but only as an afterthought.  "No, those aren't the same thing," she says. "We wouldn't be   good together."  "What's the difference?"  "I enjoy you. You enjoy me, we have a fun time, but it's not   good."  "That sounds hypocritical."  "No, it's not. It's the truth. How could I ever trust you?"  The waitress returns and fills our water glasses. She looks at   my untouched plate and says, "Foodzallright?"  "Yes, fine," I say and stick a fork into the potatoes for her   approval. She smiles and walks away. Liona is eating her fish   and smiling at me. Everyone is smiling, dammit, and I am struck   dumb by my own unhappiness.  Liona's teeth are as white as cow's milk, whiter than pearls.   But it is her lips that call attention to her face. They are   very thin and a color that I have never seen on another woman.   The color of a peach, pink-yellow. I cannot look at them closely   without feeling as I did when I first met her: that she is much   too attractive for the likes of me.  "Have I ever lied to you?" I ask.  "Not that I know."  "Well, there you are."  "But you've shown me repeatedly how subversive you are if need   be. We've been seeing each other for nearly two years." She   rolls her eyes. Yes, much too attractive.  "You're saying that because I made a relationship with you while   I was married, you can't trust me when I'm not?"  "Don't twist the words. Eat your food," she says, reaching over   with her fork for a piece of my meatloaf.  I take a bite of the meatloaf. It is still very hot. Great   texture. "Tell me what I can do to fix this."  "This isn't the kind of thing you fix, Rey. It's the kind of   thing you recognize."  "But if there's a problem..."  "There isn't a problem. You're a nice, sweet man, and I'm very   fond of you, but we can't be serious. Eat."  I look down at my full plate. The meatloaf plate here is large   and I love it because I am usually hungry after Liona and I   spend the afternoon together. It's like the sex awakens all of   my other senses. It has always struck me funny that after sex   with her, I invariably find myself having sex with Audra. I   wonder what Audra would say if she knew that Liona was   responsible for her orgasms for the last two years. Best bet is   she wouldn't approve.  I begin to eat my meatloaf, but my heart isn't in it and I   mostly stir things around to make it look like I'm eating, the   way I used to when mom made liver or goulash. I feel the dull   ache in my privates and I can't sit comfortably.  "Sore?" she asks, with a smile.  "Tired, I guess."  "Good," she says and I expect something more but she doesn't say   anything and we eat in silence for a few minutes. I watch as   Liona delicately picks through the fish and then takes each   bite. With her tongue, she searches through the bite for bones,   then gently reaches up, takes them out and sets them down on the   plate.  Finally the waitress comes back to our table and fills the water   glasses. "You no like the meatloaf?" she asks.  "It's fine, I'm just not as hungry as I thought."  "Itsa big meal. Want I should wrap it for later?" she says with   a stray finger. "Maybe you have a late snack?"  "No, its fine, thank you."  "But you hardly eat nothing."  "It's fine, really."  "Suit yourself," she says and shrugs. "You don't want pie then?"  "No."  "Do you have any chocolate?" Liona asks. I look at her plate of   fish bones. Sharp quills as white as her teeth that lie neatly   stacked to one side of the cottage cheese ball with half a   maraschino cherry on top.  "No, but we got Boston Cream."  "That would be great," Liona says and smiles and looks down.  "Skinny thing like you eating Boston Cream." The woman laughs   and turns toward the kitchen.  I know Liona is a little embarrassed because I used to watch her   put on her makeup when we first met. We had a ritual. I'd get   the room and she'd wait by the elevator. We'd ride up together   without looking at each other, then go to the room. We'd make   love and then get into the shower and talk and talk until I   could make love again. Then sex a second time, and another   shower. Then she'd sit on the vanity and fix her makeup and I'd   watch her. Married for seven years and I had no idea how a woman   put on her makeup. Powder and base and then color in her cheeks,   just a little. White shading stuff under her eyes and color over   and then a pencil and then lipstick. It takes about fifteen   minutes, all told.  At first she used to blush because she had never had a man watch   her so closely and you could see the color underneath rise up   like now. The amazing thing is, she doesn't really look any   different after, she just looks more like her. Then we'd go out   and have a meal, just like today. We've eaten in most of the   little places in town a few times, I guess.  When the waitress brings the pie and the check, I am at a loss   for words.  "You aren't going to get all weird on me, are you?" Liona asks,   taking a bite of the pie.  "Weird? No. I don't think so," I say leaning forward and taking   out my wallet.  "Do you understand why I can't keep seeing you?"  "Not at all." I start to count out the money for lunch.  "Because I want to have a real relationship."  I stop with the money and say, "I can have that," trying to look   right at her, but I can't hold it.  "No. You and I couldn't ever be more than what we are now.   Lovers."  "OK, I'll take it," I say, trying to make a joke.  "Rey, try to be serious for one minute. I'm telling you that   this afternoon was the last time."  "Why?"  "Because I have never had to trust you to be faithful, and now   that I would have to trust you, I know I can't."  "You mean that you can't be involved with me because we had an   affair."  "Basically, yes."  "Super. Just brilliant," I say. I am so pissed I can barely put   my wallet away, my hands are shaking so bad.  "Are you going back to Audra?" she says, wiping her mouth with   the paper napkin from her lap. I watch as the last of her   lipstick smears onto the napkin.  "I don't know," I say and she lifts her purse to her lap, opens   it and pulls out her lipstick.  She starts to put it on and says, "I think it would do you good   to be alone awhile." She puts on a deep red that hides her   natural color.  "Well, that I will be," I say.  "Don't worry. I'll call you at the restaurant in a few days and   make sure you're OK," she says. "Give me a kiss, then." She   leans in, but turns her head when I go to kiss her, and so I   only give her a peck on the cheek.  "Super," I say, leaning back in my chair.  "Be nice, Rey. It's not the end of the world." She stands and   turns for the door.  "No. Of course not." I say, closing my eyes and leaning my head   back, but the muscles in my neck stiffen like they are going to   cramp.  Out on the street, I'm only about four blocks from my   restaurant. I should go back and finish the afternoon list, but   I can't do it. My car is there, though, and I know that if I go   get it, I'll end up working. A restaurant is a black hole for   time: you can never work too much. Always something to be done.  It's a beautiful day: fall is here. I decide to hoof it home. I   can always get the car later, or have Carl drive it out to me. I   mean, just because my affair and my marriage are falling apart   doesn't mean that my restaurant is going anywhere, knock on   wood.  I first met Liona two years ago. She walked into the restaurant   one day while Carl and I were finishing the lunch shift. We'd   sent the two line cooks home already and we were bullshitting   and doing the afternoon list and the place was about empty and   it was one of those hellish hot days that we get around here in   August. Absolutely criminal weather, what with the haze and the   bright sun making everything glare like hell.  I was up front, and she walked through the door and the light   shone around her when the door was open. I can remember that   Carl and I both stopped still. Carl elbowed me, and I don't   know, I had had another fight with Audra or something, and the   business was going well and I felt cocky, and I knew that I   didn't have a chance in hell the moment the door closed and I   got a good look at her because she was so stunning. But I wiped   my hands on the white towel looped through my apron's tie-back,   and walked over to where she sat at the counter.  I turned over her water glass and filled it from the pitcher   covered in condensation, and she picked up the glass and drained   the whole thing. "Before you even think about a menu, you need a   stick of gum," I said.  She smiled, her white teeth shining beneath those even thin   lips. "I'm not much of a gum chewer," she said.  "But this gum is guaranteed to transport you directly to   childhood," I said and reached into my pocket. I noticed that it   was easier to speak if I didn't look directly at her, so I   leaned forward onto the counter top with one elbow. "Fruitstripe   Gum." I said and held out the package to her. I looked up into   her blue eyes as she grinned and I had one of those moments.   Religious. Angelic. Something. Carl walked across the restaurant   toward the kitchen behind her, and I remember him waving his   arms in the air and making the football referee's gesture for   "injury on the field."  I watched her hands as she unfolded the wrapper and put the   striped piece of gum in her mouth. "This gum is like fourth   grade," she said and laughed.  "Told you."  "Why are you carrying around Fruitstripe Gum?"  "Too much free time," I said.  "It's awfully sweet,"  "The gum or..."  "The gum," she said and laughed again.  "Don't worry, the flavor only lasts about five minutes."  "Probably just as well," she said. "I came in for lunch."  "I think we can handle that," I said and nodded. The place was   nearly empty.  "What do you recommend?'  "Do you eat meat?"  "It's awfully hot out," she said and looked past me to the   windows.  "Something light?"  "And cool."  "Cold fried chicken and my own special potato salad," I said and   stood up straight.  "Lemonade?"  "Definitely. My name's Rey."  "Sounds perfect, Rey."  "Save room for dessert," I said, picking up a serving plate, and   walking back to the cooler door in the back of the dining room.   When I caught the handle of the cooler, it was cold. "Hey, if   you're hot, come back here for a second," I said.  She looked at me for a moment, then got up and walked over. I   can remember thinking how beautiful she was, and noticing that I   was itching my wedding ring finger with my thumb. As if I was   turning it, but it wasn't there. I don't wear it to work because   it gets too hot over the stoves.  "What is it?" she asked.  "Coolest place around," I said and pulled open the heavy blue   door. On hot days, cool air rushes out of the walk-in cooler   like a cold wind. I flipped on the light, said, "C'mon, you're   letting the cold out," and went in. She followed and pulled the   door closed.  "Heavenly," she said.  It's actually about 40 degrees. "Feels great, doesn't it?"  "Unbelievable."  I reached into the rack and pulled out the long tray of fried   chicken I'd cooked off that morning. "I'm serving these tonight,   but I'll make an exception. Which one do you want?"  She leaned past me, over the tray and pointed. "There," she   said. I could smell her hair she was so close. I could see the   goosebumps on her shoulders. I could see the fine freckles and   short peach fuzz on the back of her neck.  I took the tongs from the side of the rack and put the piece on   the serving plate. "A fine choice. Potato salad's up front," I   said and slid the tray back into the rack.  "My name's Liona," she said, stepping back and sticking out a   thin hand to me.  "I was wondering how I was going to ask," I said, and shook her   hand. It was cold. Her hands are always ice cold.  "I think I could just stand in here all day."  "Not in that dress. You'd catch your death," I said and walked   out of the cooler.  She ate daintily and we chatted all the way through her meal. I   gave her a piece of raspberry cheesecake I'd made the night   before and asked her to go to dinner with me.  It was that easy.  My house is a beautiful old victorian that Audra inherited. When   we got it, you couldn't see across the living room because the   ceiling sagged so badly. We've worked on it for almost our   entire nine years. It's been a long haul.  I step up the stairs of the front porch and open the door. With   my hand still on the knob, I hear it. I stand stock still for a   moment, listening to Audra's groaning gradually building, and I   know from the tone that if I stand here for another five minutes   or so, I will probably hear her make that noise she makes when   she comes.  I step back onto the porch and look up and down the street for   cars. About a block down is the Jensons' green Toyota. No one. I   step back into the house and slam the door hard enough to shake   the walls. The noise overhead stops. I hear moving feet. I drop   my keys on the hall table and walk into the living room. The air   conditioning comes on. The upstairs bathroom door closes.  In a moment, "That you, Rey?" comes down the stairs. It's Carl's   voice.  "Don't come down or I'll kick your fucking ass," I say without   raising my voice. I could use a drink, and walk over to the   liquor cabinet and get a bottle of Jack Daniels from the shelf.   I start to grab a glass and don't.  "Can we talk about this?" comes the voice of my closest friend.  "No. Crawl out the damn window and jump off the back porch. Jump   off the fucking moon," I say and open the bottle and take a deep   drink. My throat gags and I cough, but I take another.  "I'm coming down," Carl says from the top of the stairs.  "Then you'll be dead and I'll be in jail," I say, and I sit down   on the sofa. I take another swig, bite back the edge of the   whiskey, kick off my shoes and put my feet up on the coffee   table. I hear Carl walk back across the upstairs, into the den   and open a window. Then I hear him on the roof. It's about a   twenty-foot drop. He'll probably break a leg if he jumps. I   don't think he will; he's not the type. At some point, I will   have to let him back in the house.  There is almost complete silence now, except for the sound of   Audra crying in the bathroom. This noise is replaced by the   sound of water running into the tub. I try to drink a few inches   of the whiskey, hoping to avoid the entire discussion that I   know will take place as soon as the water drains, but I can't.  Instead, I set the bottle on the table top, reach into my back   pocket and pull out my wallet. I take out the thick wad of   credit cards, remove the rubber band from around them, and start   flipping them over, face down on the coffee table. I start at   the top of the first row, dialing the number on the back.   Mastercard. The water stops running into the bathtub.  "Yes, I need to report my Mastercard is missing," I say to the   silky voiced young woman on the phone. "I seem to have lost my   wallet this morning and I need to have this account stopped   until I locate it," I take another drink, give the woman the   required number, say thank you, hang up and dial the number for   the Visa.  American Express, Diner's, then Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Penney's   and the local store cards. I decide to keep the Sears card and   the gas card. As I finish, the bottle is about a quarter gone,   and I hear the water from the tub gurgling through the old   plumbing. I dial the phone number of the restaurant.  "Mable's," comes the voice of the hostess.  "It's Rey, patch me back to Steve in the kitchen." I hear the   bathroom door open above me.  "Right away, Mr. Colvain." The line clicks. I hear Audra start   down the steps.  "What can I do you for, Rey," comes Steve's voice, our sous   chef. I can hear the sound of the fan in the convection oven   kick on. Cheesecakes must be in.  "I need you to finish the list, I'm not going to get back," I   say and I watch as her feet and then legs and then robe appear   through the railing banister.  "What do you want to run for specials?"  "I can't do this Steve, and I'm not going to be in tomorrow.   Probably won't see Carl either. Can you just cover till tomorrow   night?" Make no mistake, Audra is a beautiful woman in her own   right. Red hair bunched up on the back of her head. I raise a   hand for her to stop. She ignores me and walks into the kitchen.  "You OK, boss?" Steve asks.  "No, as a matter of fact, I'm fucking awful. I'll call tomorrow   sometime."  "I'll cover it."  "OK then," I say and hang up the phone.  Audra walks back into the room with a large glass of Seven-Up.   Her white robe is draped closed around her and she opens the   liquor cabinet and fishes out a glass and a coaster. She sets   the coaster on the coffee table in front of me, puts the glass   on it, and sits down on the other sofa, pulling her feet up   under her, knees together. Just like her.  "Are you planning to get a divorce, then?" I ask.  "I hadn't really thought about it."  "You should have."  "I should have when you opened Mable's."  "Don't make excuses," I say and tip an inch of whiskey into the   glass.  "Pour some of that in here, will you?" she says and holds out   her glass. I fill the top inch. Audra inserts her finger and   half stirs it, then licks her finger clean.  "Did it have to be Carl?" I ask.  "It didn't have to be anyone. I'm sorry it was Carl."  "Is he the only one?"  "Yes."  "Are you lying?"  "No," she says, but I know her well enough that she could be if   she wanted to. Of course, so could I.  I drink the whiskey without choking and set the glass down hard.   Then I repour two inches, and sip at it. "Can you tell me why?"  "Not without making excuses."  "What can you tell me?"  "That I'm lonely."  "So you fucked my best friend? Jesus," I say and lean back on   the couch. The couch is so deep that I am almost lying   horizontally and I rest the glass on my thigh.  "No, I looked for someone who would pay me some mind."  "Fucking is a strange way to make friends," I say to the   ceiling, letting my eyes close.  "Are you mad because I slept with him?"  "Didn't sound like sleeping," I snap, sitting up, and I can feel   the alcohol now, making my head spin. Making me angry.  "Or are you mad because I slept with anyone?"  "Both. But him I have to work with, dammit. I have to look at   him."  "I'm sorry about that," she says, and takes a drink of her   drink.  "Do you love him?" I ask.  "No. No more than you do."  "What does that mean?"  "You spend more time with him than you do with me."  "I run a restaurant with the guy."  "And the restaurant gets all of your attention. Even now you   called it before we spoke."  "Are you trying to blame this on the restaurant?"  "No. This isn't the kind of thing you blame on something, Rey.   It's the kind of thing you recognize."  "Yeah," I say, stunned. I drift, closing my eyes, back to Liona   and already her face is fading.  There is a long silence. I nod.  "I can't do this," Carl calls from upstairs. I spill my drink.  "Shit," I say, standing up fast.  Audra laughs.  I have to piss. "Would you deal with him?" I ask and walk off to   the toilet.  Pissing, I look at the calendar. Today is St. Michael's feast   day, September 30. My mom sent the calendar; I am long-since   lapsed. Audra and I were married Catholic. That was about the   last time I set foot in the church. I had enough from Catholic   school. I can hear Carl climbing back in the window.  Saint Mike was the general in God's army of Angels, I remember   from catechism class. He was made of snow. I guess the intended   effect was that kids would think they were safe in snowstorms,   or something. Or that he was like a blizzard to his enemies,   everywhere at once. All it ever made me think about was how when   you made a snow-man, you made a thing, but when you made a   snow-angel, you made a space: a hole.  I am pretty drunk and I wash my face in the sink, trying to   sober up a bit, but I can't get St. Mike out of my mind. Is what   Liona and I had a real thing or just a space between Audra and   me? I hear the front door close.  When I am back out in the living room, Audra is seated again.   "Is he gone?" I ask.  "Yes."  "Am I supposed to go?" I ask. I start to pick up the credit   cards.  "You don't have to," she says.  I stop what I'm doing. "Do you want me to stay?"  "If you want to stay married."  "We're married," I say, but the words sound strange to me. It's   been a long time since I really thought about being married. All   I've thought about for a long time now is getting divorced. I   sit down next to her.  "I don't want you to stay because you feel obligated," she says   and puts a hand on my knee. She has beautiful hands, I remember.  "Marriage means being obligated," I say, but I can hear how   hollow those words sound.  The house is dead quiet. In a whisper she says, "Then go."  I have wanted her to say those words for almost a year now, to   let me off the hook easy. But when they come, I know that I   don't want them. "No, that's too easy," I say.  "I don't want to fight," she says, pulling back from me.  I push my feet into the cushions on the back of the couch.   "That's not the point. The whole point of marriage is that you   can't just leave," I say, hoping that by saying the words I will   believe them, make them real.  "Yes you can, I'll give you a divorce, if that's what you want,"   she says.  "No, it doesn't matter what I want. That's not the point.   Sometimes being married is bad. But you don't just leave. That's   not being married."  "You shouldn't stay if it's that bad. If you want to leave."  "No, you still have to stay. Right now is the _worse_ part of   `for better or for worse.' This is just the worse part." I say,   trying to convince myself.  "Will there be a better part again?" she says.  "I don't know. I can't say," I answer and just look at her. We   sit a long time in silence. I try to remember the things that   made us get married. If I can only think of them, then maybe we   can have a better part again.  Neal Gordon <nbgordon@i-2000.com>-----------------------------------  Neal Gordon teaches at the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia and   works with the Working Writer's Group, a long-running critical   group in the Philadelphia area.  Ox-Plum Road   by Hollis Drew===============================....................................................................  We search for meaning in life’s events; sometimes that search is   fruitless.....................................................................  One thousand years ago, a holy man traveling to Hangzhou in east   central China surprised his rustic audience with the news that   their local mountain had once stood near his village back in   India. His followers quickly renamed their mountain "The   Mountain That Flew Here." Today vacationing honeymooners visit   this magical mountain to pray for prosperity and the happy   arrival of sons.  My father, Guy Woodleaf, was twelve when he chopped off his twin   brother's finger with an ax. The year was 1930. Guilt,   indignities, betrayal, and brutish circumstances were   commonplace that year. Mrs. Woodleaf sent her twins into the   henhouse early one Sunday morning to kill two chickens for   lunch. Aunt Violet has always believed Shawn only intended it as   a joke: He laid his pinkie upon the bloody chopping block while   two headless chickens flopped around in the yard.  "I dare you!" Shawn said, sneering at Guy.  "I'll do it!" Guy said, then cocked the ax above his head.  A chicken rose and staggered blindly toward the twins. Guy   jumped out of its path while Shawn hooted his youthful contempt.   The chicken wobbled off in a drunken barnyard do-si-do before it   kicked onto its side.  "Chicken!" Shawn chortled. He spit through his teeth like a   boxer.  Guy raised the ax into the air and hesitated.  Shawn shouted, "Double-dog dare!"  _Whack!_  Shawn yelped sharply, grabbed his gushing hand, and dashed   across the porch and inside the house with a torn expression of   alarm and gutsy admiration for his brother's nerve etched across   his face. It was one of the rare moments when anyone would see   Shawn cry.  Guy had been born first. He had emerged thin and unhappy and   vaguely introspective and, just like a dog or bear, rarely   stopped to consider the universe outside the bankrupt impulses   which would one day destroy him. The midwife was busy cleaning   up when Grandmother launched Shawn into the womb of time like a   slick melon seed flicked between her forefinger and thumb. The   family claims he entered the world laughing. Shawn would become   the wild child and, truth be told, his parents' favorite son. In   time, because of his toughness, he loomed as big as the   flesh-eating Minotaur. Their older sisters immediately adored   the new twins and squabbled over who would bathe them and powder   their bottoms and smear Vaseline upon their quaint nubbins.  The twins left school after finishing the eighth grade to farm   with their father in the Mississippi River bottoms. Guy said he   had enjoyed school some while it had lasted. Shawn didn't seem   to really give a damn.  Most of the other young men from the bottoms left school with   them: By then they could read and write, multiply and divide,   and knew enough history to participate in a rural democracy.   They quickly developed a respect for the lush geography that   shaped them, and understood its selectivity much better than   many who finished high school. While marginal crops and   difficult field hands often left them exhausted, the yearning   leg-clench of their women left them feverish and reverential.   They believed in determination and sacrifice, God and family and   country, and that playing by the rules really mattered. Too   emotionally distant to articulate well such deeply rooted   passions, many of those tough plowboys could kill. They would   soon make some damned good soldiers, those big glorious men.  Shawn was the first to tire of farming and joined the Merchant   Marines shortly before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Each   year at Christmas, Aunt Violet corners me between the chocolate   pie and the banana nut fruitcake to whisper a solemn foreboding,   since most Woodleaf men die so violently in their prime. (I   admit to having wondered if my father felt a nasty twitch of   what lay in store for him when the telegram announced Shawn was   lost at sea.)  Then she closes her large doleful eyes, clutches her chest as if   wringing aching hunger from tragic old memories, and repeats our   family's long bloated epiphany:  Shawn died shortly after midnight below decks in an oil tanker   torpedoed five miles off the coast of Texas in March of 1942.   The family had desperately prayed that Shawn had managed to   survive, and several brave plots were invented: Shawn had been a   gifted Sunday-afternoon athlete who loved competition and   bruises and glory; surely such a young bull could easily swim   five miles in a calm sea.  But the War Department had sent the tanker's lone survivor, a   badly scarred young sailor who had stood watch on the bow that   fateful night, to assure the family that Shawn had died quickly   in his sleep. The young seaman had stuttered; and he had spoken   sadly, and with great guilt, about his brave comrades who had   died in their sleep, while he had been blown clear of most of   the sizzling oil. Aunt Violet says she knew from the look in his   one good eye, he wished he had perished with Shawn.  The ship went down quickly. "N-n-no, there w-w-were no   s-s-screams; j-j-j-just the hissing of the s-s-ship as it   s-s-sank b-b-beneath the wa-wa-water."  There was no more doubt about it: Shawn was gone.  Guy, married by then, had not waited on the draft, but had   enlisted only a few days after Pearl Harbor. It was the right   thing to do, just as it was the right time to be magnanimous,   and he had felt only temporary disgust for the giddy town boys   with the bright, coddled looks and smell of a vacation who had   applied for military deferments as gentlemen farmers. After   Pearl Harbor, I imagine he felt the same remote hunger he must   have felt after quitting school; he listened patiently to the   moral outrage of his crippled President, but also clearly   understood with the rapid pulse of a hunter the gut-ripping   realities of war. When the Army trained him as a medic, it was   OK with him; he had often doctored the deep wounds of stubborn   mules and careless black men. Then for several tedious months he   had escorted shell-shocked soldiers to makeshift asylums   throughout the South before he finally received word that he was   headed overseas. That night he called for his young bride, Diane   Rose.  Mother rode in an overcrowded train for eighteen hours to say   goodbye to a husband she barely knew in an obscure hotel room   somewhere in Kansas City. Her world had grown acute since Pearl   Harbor. And, although she had been physically exhausted by her   trip, she had fought back her tears to make their last night   together special, just in case something unthinkable happened to   Guy as it had to Shawn.  Guy had a secret plan. Since the last thing Diane Rose wanted   was a child to raise alone, Guy had secretly snipped off the tip   of his condom. Getting the beautiful Diane Rose pregnant made   urgent sense to this laconic man more accustomed to the swoosh   of a plow than the deep drumbeat of war.  Afterwards, she was outraged to discover Guy's cheap deception   and thrummed her indignation to everyone in the family who would   listen. But on that night my father wasn't moved by her anger   and righteous tears; if a man was about to die in his prime, his   wife should at least have a baby. So, like millions of other   wartime brides, my mother discovered her husband was as capable   of dishonesty as the next horny man.  "If it's a boy, name him Aaron!" he shouted to Diane Rose as his   troop train pulled away from the loading platform early the next   morning, leaving her shivering and anxious and alone in the   bitter teeth of a February snowstorm.  It was almost three years before Guy returned home, exhausted by   terrible visions on Guadalcanal and changed forever by the awful   momentum of those years. While he served overseas, Grandfather   had died from cirrhosis of the liver brought on by a bout with   hepatitis, and Grandmother had moved off the farm and in with   his sister in Clarksdale, Mississippi.  Wartime photographs of my father dressed in his sleek, green   Army uniform show a serious young man with dark eyes and heavy   eyebrows. His military hat is cocked back upon the top of his   head. In those old photographs, which I love, he glows virtuous   and ripping and timeless.  He soon found work as an automobile mechanic at the Ford   dealership in Lazich and convinced Diane Rose they needed   another child, my sister, Hanna. We rode with him when he died   violently on a cold Sunday afternoon.  January that year had opened with several warm, vagrant days   that promised much more than the month could deliver, then   turned raw as an ice storm knocked out the electrical power for   three bitter days. Many in bundled Lazich staggered before a   surgical wind that cracked open their tired old bones. My father   had just reluctantly agreed to serve as a pallbearer for a   distant cousin whom he had not seen in years. Since it also   meant hauling all of us over one hundred miles into Mississippi   to sleep in a strange, lumpy bed, he saw little reason to feel   honored. But, still, Minnie was family.  Hanna and I had raged like heathens at the cemetery that   afternoon, and Hanna had almost pitched headlong into Cousin   Minnie's open grave during a game of tag with our young   Mississippi cousins. Our father snapped his fingers at our   mother and pointed us toward our car, but Mother was too busy   snuffing out her grief with a frilly handkerchief to notice. So,   he marched us out behind a cedar tree and thrashed us with his   belt.  When we returned, Cousin Minnie's casket had been lowered into   her grave, and the funeral party was breaking up before the   biting wind. My father tossed a handful of dirt onto the coffin   as an earnest though feeble salute, but the coffin lid drummed   back unkindly. Sullen gravediggers in heavy gray overalls and   gray cowhide gloves tweaked their shovels impatiently in a mound   of waiting dirt. It quickly became obvious he was just in the   way.  As we meekly climbed into the backseat of our car, he mumbled to   our mother, "The only reason God gives us kids is to humble us!"  He rushed us through Memphis and across the turbid Mississippi   River. Shafts of filtered sunlight pierced the afternoon's eerie   grayish-green cast. When we turned onto a familiar narrow county   road that lead toward our home in Lazich, I had regained enough   courage to ask, "Momma, tell me again why it's called Ox-Plum   Road."  Mother smiled. She had been blessed with charm and the gift of   words. And even if she had granted my frequent requests and   retold a story a thousand times, I always wanted to hear it   again:  "Back toward that line of trees over there," she said, sweeping   her hand to the open fields outside the car in a gesture so   subtly defined each of us, even my father, turned our gaze to   the distant line of leafless trees, "Two brothers once farmed   several acres of land, land that had once belonged to their   father, and before that to their father's father, and even his   father before him." She paused to allow the sweep of such   history to etch our souls.  "Being brothers, and naturally competitive, each brother wanted   to make a flamboyant mark to win the hand of a young widow both   brothers loved. The older brother had planted a prized plum   orchard that almost everyone agreed made the best plum jelly in   the county. Like a cider famous for its sweetness, the juice   from these plums was unlike all others. Its crystal amber was   described as something fit for the table of the gods.  "Well, the younger brother couldn't be outdone, and he cherished   a stout ox, which he had lovingly raised from soon after its   birth. Some said he loved this ox almost as much as he loved the   pretty widow -- and maybe even more than his brother loved his   wild plums, if that was possible.  "Each fall, when he showed the ox at the fair, he always brought   home a blue ribbon. Just as his older brother brought home blue   ribbons for his plum jelly.  "Then one day something happened to the ox. Everyone had a   theory. Some said maybe a swarm of bees stung it. Others said it   drank poisoned water. Nobody really knew. But something happened   to the ox, and it broke through a fence and raged throughout the   plum orchard, where it destroyed all of the prized plum trees.   The angry farmer, in a wild rage, then killed his brother's ox   with an ax.  "When confronted by his young brother, the farmer, still reeling   from anger at his losses, boasted of his deed. The two brothers   then cursed the day the other had been born. The younger brother   stormed off after swearing he would soon get revenge.  Late that night the ox's owner slipped through a window in his   brother's cabin and killed his brother in his sleep. Some said   he used the ax that killed his ox. Others said, instead, he   strangled his brother with a strand of rusty wire.  "A mob of angry neighbors didn't wait for a trial, but hanged   the younger brother from a large cottonwood tree that grew along   this road. Then they burned his body and left him hanging for   days as an example to others of how unchecked greed will spoil   their hearts. And that's how this road got its name."  I fell back against the seat and thought about the sweet taste   of wild plum jelly and how awful it would feel to be strangled   with rusty barbed wire.  We were almost home when a large black car blocked our passage.   I watched the other car hog the road. Strong gusts of wind   buffeted it across the center line, then back against the hard   gravel shoulder making it impossible for us to safely pass.   Ox-Plum Road had been built many decades earlier down the   turn-rows at the ends of long cotton fields; it was a dangerous   road, which twisted and galvanized itself into a treacherous   tangle.  My mother gripped the dashboard with her long, red fingernails,   meant to mimic the long, sensuous nails of her idol, Bette   Davis. "He's drunk, Guy!" Mother said, biting her bottom lip in   annoyance while thrusting out her chin.  "Nigger!" my father growled. He jerked impatiently at the knot   on the wide tie I had chosen for him at Christmas.  I cowered against the backseat. Mother had once warned me to   never use the word "nigger" around the "coloreds" because they   could retaliate by calling me a "bastard." (Bastard? --   something, no doubt, ugly, dark, and sticky as a goat turd; she   had secretly whispered the word bastard with her lips pressed   tightly against my ear.)  I kneaded the clay-colored corduroy upholstery of our car with   my fingers and thumb and sniffed cautiously at the odor of my   fear -- a fruitlike dankness akin to that of the sallow dirt   scoured from the depths of Cousin Minnie's grave; I glanced   cautiously at my father's eyes reflected in the rear-view   mirror. His coal black eyes snapped open, then blinked softly   shut, just like a turtle's lazy crescent eyes do as it crunches   the head off a water moccasin.  The absolute tone in his voice was the same one he had used   earlier that morning when he had caught me looking up Aunt   Sarah's dress from my hiding place under the breakfast table.   (The day before I had overheard my father tell some men at the   funeral home that it was a pity that Sarah had never remarried;   she might be his sister-in-law, but he wasn't blind. The woman   had some fine, long legs.) Kapop! Kapop! Kapop! The belt had   slashed with quirky authority across my butt. Don't cry! Don't   cry! my father had warned.  I listened closely to the coupling of the accelerator, gear, and   clutch -- an ingenious mastery of an unforgiving machine. Mother   gripped the strap on the passenger door. Her pinched expression   showed the grim complicity of the rattled. Hanna played with the   wide-eyed doll she had received for Christmas. An annoying bug   when at her best, Hanna was too young to really matter.  My father retreated twenty yards. His jaw had stiffened into a   scowling determination. His red-scrubbed mechanic hands gripped   the steering wheel. Grease in the lines of his knuckles had been   cast into braids of gray lace. His wonderful magic made the   engine roar. Then he smiled at me in the rear-view mirror, a   brief smile full of child-like conspiracy: Watch this one,   Spooner! (Spooner was his pet name for a child who shoveled in   his oatmeal at breakfast.)  The black car up ahead swerved slowly to the right. Father saw   his chance and slammed the gas pedal against the floor. Our old   Ford responded with such a splendid leap my father grunted   eagerly. Then the other car danced back across the center line   just as my father dug a hard left to pass.  Our cars brushed in a soft, clumsy kiss. Time crawled up in one   long, insidious jiggle until I was thrown free. Our car sent up   a great ball of white dust and gravel as it rolled beneath me. I   could have easily reached out and touched the power lines   nearby, but I remembered mother's warning that electricity could   kill me. Then my face plowed into the hard gravel on the   shoulder of the road.  The other driver backed his car to a stop beside me. A tall   woman opened the passenger door and stepped out to tower above   me. She was young, maybe seventeen or eighteen, and she wore a   white letter sweater over a white blouse and black skirt. A gold   letter D was sewn onto her sweater and three gold chevrons   adorned one sleeve. Her long brown legs ended in a pair of   tattered shoes. She wore no socks over her sharp ankles. She   stepped cautiously toward me like a lanky, guarded bird.  I sat up with great effort. Needles of pain stabbed my face. I   tried to stand, but my foot was twisted at a crazy angle and   couldn't bear my weight. The abstracted face of the young woman   stiffened, as if she was studying something quizzical or   something unreal or something mighty troubling. She slapped   herself sharply with both arms and rocked from her waist. She   opened her lips to emit a low, painful moan. Then she pinned her   bottom lip beneath her upper teeth as she moaned. She nodded   slowly and rocked deeply -- like old women in a trance sometimes   do in a fundamentalist church service.  I reached up for her hand. "Help me," I asked. She quit rocking   to pull me to my feet. I stood for a shaky moment, but fell back   into the hard, loose gravel. She then walked toward the hunkered   wreckage of our car. The battered hood dangled from the front of   the car like an exhausted tongue. The front passenger door was   ripped away. Dirt and gravel and strips of metal were pelted up   and down the highway like silver jacks. Steam hassled up from   the wounded radiator in marvelous frosty plumes. The rancid   stench of gasoline hung low in the air. My father's right leg   was pinned under the wreck.  Mother straddled my father's chest, and she reminded me of a   mechanical bird in a carnival booth dipping for a shallow drink   from the rim of a water glass. They seemed caught up in a game   of roughhouse we sometimes played on the living room rug. She   clutched his shirt below the collar. My proud Christmas tie was   twisted behind his neck. "Wake up, Guy!" she shouted. "You've   gotta wake up now."  The young woman who stood above them nudged my father with her   shoe, but, like a cold viper, he didn't move. I glanced through   the open door at the man in the front seat of the big black car.   A faded cotton quilt had slid onto the floor of the car in a   soiled heap. An old guitar was propped up against the front   seat. Its long neck poked into the air, and the driver whumped   it sideways with his arm as he leaned in my direction. "Come   on!" he shouted through her open door. I flinched and glanced   quickly away before he noticed me.  Then the man clumsily shoved open his door and stood with his   elbow wedged against his car. "Come on! Quick!" It was the young   woman and not me he wanted.  "They need help," the woman called. She pronounced it _hep._  "Git yore black ass back in this goddamned car!" he shouted. He   jerked his cupped hand across his chest.  The woman turned away. Her long brown hand floated down to   gently touch Mother's shoulder. Mother looked quizzically up   into the young woman's face. "He won't wake up," Mother said.   She shook Father's shoulders again. "You've gotta wake up, Guy!   You quit teasin' me and wake up!"  The driver lurched toward the young woman. She jerked backward   when he grabbed her sweater and yanked her away from the wreck.   He waved his big brown hand again in the direction of his car.   "Hurry!" But he didn't sound as angry as before.  "Why?" the young woman persisted. She seemed drowsy, half-awake.  He snapped the heel of his fist against her shoulder and spun   her around. "Do it now! Before somebody comes!" But the woman   wouldn't leave.  The man stared past her for a moment deciding. He squatted   beside my father and studied my father's face. My mother looked   at the man but did not speak. The cold wind whipped the man's   dark flannel trousers around his legs. He breathed heavily   through his nostrils, like something cornered after a long chase   over high ground. He looked across his shoulder along Ox-Plum   Road which stretched out toward Lazich. He rubbed his fingers   anxiously across his lips. He stood quickly. I heard his knees   pop. Then he walked past the wreckage of our car and stooped to   lift something that shimmered brightly in the road. Then I saw   it, too. It was the silver-plated pistol my father always   carried in the car when we traveled.  The young woman stared at the pistol in the man's hand. "Whacha   gone do?" the woman asked.  "Move!" he shouted at the woman. I crabbed backward from the   edge of the road; I was really afraid of him then.  He stood for a long moment deciding. He glanced both ways down   the long empty road. The young woman squealed and turned to run   back toward his big black car. She turned and stood beside the   open door with her hand pressed across her mouth. The man cocked   the hammer on the pistol.  I heard it click -- as solid as a lock snapping shut. My heart   froze in my throat. I was young but I knew what my father's   pistol could do: I had watched it shatter glass jugs from my   father's well-placed shots, and, on a crisp autumn morning, drop   a two hundred pound hog to its knees before a steaming washpot.  "Don't!" I shouted at the man.  The man jumped. Maybe he was scared, too. He looked at me.   "Don't, mister," I said. "Don't hurt my momma." I rolled up onto   my hands and knees. The hard gravel on the shoulder of the road   dimpled my palms. He studied me carefully, then looked down at   Mother. I thought he spent a long time thinking about what he   must do. Mother hummed a tune that had been playing all week on   the radio in our living room. The man uncocked the pistol before   he dropped it into his coat pocket.  The man crossed the road in front of me and glanced down at me   as he passed. The gravel crunched under the soles of his   brown-and-white oxford shoes. I looked quickly away and pushed   myself further from his car. When he reached the driver's door,   he slid inside. "Hurry!" he said again to the young woman.  She shoved the guitar back upright and scrambled inside. The   soiled quilt bunched up under her feet. The man slammed his door   shut and hit the starter button roughly with his thumb. The   engine groaned, then fired. The young woman looked over at me   for the last time as the driver shifted into first gear. Then   she closed the door as they sped away.  I cautiously pulled myself through the gravel until I reached   Mother. She still rocked back and forth upon my father's chest,   but with deeper, more agitated movements than she had earlier.   My father's head rolled in my direction. I touched his huge, red   hand. It felt like the chilled rubbery cap of a mushroom. His   eyes were open, but had puddled into cold, black pools.  I heard a soft, thumping noise and turned to watch Hanna crawl   though a crack under the front seat, which had been torn loose   from its tracks. She pulled her Christmas doll behind her. She   waddled over and sat beside me. Her gray bonnet had been twisted   on her head. When I reached to straighten it, she slapped at my   hand.  Hanna and I waited patiently beside our father, while the   shrill, plaintive cries of a killdeer in a nearby field of   cotton stubble arched neatly through the cold, green air. The   bird screeched at us, as if through force it could finally be   heard, then urgently raced away on some new mission.  It seemed as if we waited forever before help came. Then cars   suddenly appeared on both sides of the road. People jabbered and   tripped over themselves to glimpse or poke or caress. Someone in   the crowd announced proudly that he had called the Law.   Strangers stuck their bright red faces before mine and ordered   me not to move with thick husky voices, like they were choking   on milk, while others kept a safe, gawking distance between   themselves and the wreck. Maybe they thought we were contagious,   because they pressed their young children so tightly against   their legs. "It happens just like that!" some old beetle-faced   philosopher barked, loudly snapping her fingers to clarify the   sweet brevity of life. I felt strangely excited and proud, like   our family had done something clever enough to win respect from   these strangers.  A young schoolteacher from Lazich brought Hanna and me from the   cold into the backseat of her car. She couldn't touch us enough   with her tender fingers. Her husband revved his car engine, and   the warm air from the car heater caused my nose to run. The   teacher reached over the front seat and touched my face with a   soft, silk handkerchief. She grimaced when she lifted it away.   "Jesus! Sweet Jesus!" she whispered. The handkerchief was   stained with blood.  "Ouch!"  "Sorry!" she said. "Do you remember me, Aaron? I am Mrs.   Forshey, from school..." She smiled.  I remembered. She taught the older children in fifth grade.   "What's wrong with my daddy?" I asked.  Mrs. Forshey glanced outside the car window toward the wreck.   Then she glanced at her husband. "It'll be OK," she said gently   while patting my hand.  I heard a thin wail skip across the fields like a flat stone   across water, then grow with startling intensity as an ambulance   pulled up beside the wreck. The crowd had reluctantly parted to   let the ambulance through, then tightly pulled back in upon   itself in order to see.  I searched anxiously through the weaving legs of the crowd until   I saw my mother crumpled in the gravel at the edge of the road.   She didn't look real but more like something hastily daubed onto   canvas. Someone had tucked his suit coat around her shoulders to   keep her warm. Several men were working to free my father's   pinned leg, while a fat man in dirty overalls struggled to lift   the car with a crippled jack that slipped down one notch for   every two it gained. He finally motioned for the pressing crowd   to move back.  "I want out," I said to Mrs. Forshey.  "Me, too!" Hanna piped up in sweet, hot mimicry.  Mrs. Forshey shook her head. "We must get you to a doctor,   Aaron," she said. Her admonishment would have worked on the   schoolyard, but not today. I grabbed for the door handle, but   Mrs. Forshey gently held my shoulder. "You can't walk," she   said. I struggled to break free. Hanna burst into tears.  "I'll carry him back," Mr. Forshey said.  "No, let me."  Mrs. Forshey reluctantly placed me at Mother's side. I reached   out and touched her elbow. "Momma?" I asked. She slowly turned   her face in my direction, then back at the men struggling with   the car jack. Unable to resuscitate the old realities and unable   to break herself free, she hummed softly, something playful and   dreamy, but to herself, while the cold evening breeze whistled   musically across the broken shards of our car's windshield with   a faint, mocking lamentation -- like the uncertain resonance of   an aeolian harp.  Mrs. Forshey knelt beside her in the gravel. "Your children are   with us," she said, pointing back over her shoulder to her car.   "We'll take care of them for you, Mrs. Woodleaf." She reached   out to touch one of Mother's hands.  "I don't have children," Mother said with an odd shake of her   head. The words rose from the roots of her throat and   crystallized into feathery white blossoms as they spilled into   the air.  Mrs. Forshey lifted me back up into her arms. I struggled again   but more weakly than before. This time she pulled me close to   her chest. "We're going now," she said firmly. Mother looked   away.  When we reached the car, Mrs. Forshey eased me into the back   seat with Hanna. Hanna pointed a tiny finger at my face.  "Don't!" I said. I touched the torn flesh along my cheek, but   quickly jerked my fingers from the gritty, zippered skin.  The late winter light had seeped deep melon hues across the   evening sky. Although kind adults protected me, I knew my father   was dead. But I was only seven. I was too young to comprehend   how his death, like Shawn's, would soon become another gooey,   wormy marker among the eternal mysteries of the universe.  Hollis Drew <jamesrcox@aol.com> ---------------------------------  Hollis Drew lives in Jackson, Mississippi, where he is gainfully   unemployed. This story is based on the actual events of his   life.  How Joe Found a Living    by Adam Harrington==============================================....................................................................  Who says they don't tell fairy tales any more? The characters   have just changed, that's all.....................................................................   1. In which Joe leaves home to find his fortune.--------------------------------------------------  One light and bright day as excited spring breezes danced around   the new green shoots in the meadow, Joe's mother hooshed Joe out   of the house with the end of her broom.  "You're old enough to find a living now," she said. "Go to the   town and get one."  Joe pulled on his boots and wrapped some bread, some apples and   the money his mother gave him to carry through a rainy day in a   red-striped handkerchief and tied it to the end of a stick. He   slung it over his shoulder and set off for the town.  At the first house near the town he politely knocked on the door   and stepped back with his hands behind him.  "Hello," said the fat man who opened the door. "What can I do   for you?"  "I'm looking for a living, sir," said Joe. "Do you know where I   can find one?"  "Not here, son, at any rate. Good day." He shut the door none   too gently.  Joe picked up his stick and walked to the next house.  "Good morning sir," he called up to a thatcher patting down the   cut straw on a barn roof. "Do you need any help? I'm looking for   a living."  "Good morning to you, my boy. Have you any experience in   thatching?"  "No, but I'm quick to learn."  "So are hundreds of others. I need an experienced thatcher --   I'm competing against all the other thatchers in the area for   speed, quality and price. I can't afford to teach anyone."  "Surely if no one is teaching thatching, when you retire there   will be no more thatchers."  The thatcher shrugged. "That won't be my problem, son. Good luck   finding a living."  Joe walked on to the next house, chewing a sweet grass stem and   whistling.  "Good morning madam," he called over the garden fence to the   woman tending her flower beds.  "Good morning young man," said the woman. "What can I do for   you?"  "Please madam, could you tell me wherever and ever I can find a   living?"  "Ooh, now you're asking," she said. "There's not been any of   those in these parts for years. Why don't you try the center of   town?" So Joe thanked the woman and walked to the center of   town.  He came on a house with a few broken windows and in desperate   need of paint.  "Good afternoon, sir," Joe said as the owner-occupier slowly   opened the door. "I see that your house needs some renovation --   would you be willing to hire me?"  "Only if it costs nothing," said the man, who was wearing a   dirty vest. "This isn't the only house in town that's about to   disintegrate. Nobody has any money to fix such things because   very few of us have jobs. All the family's money is going on the   mortgage. I'm sorry, but we can't afford you."  Joe then went to the town hall and found the director of public   works.  "Good afternoon, sir," said Joe. "Your marketplace is awfully   dirty -- I can clean it for you if you like."  "That's very good of you, young man. Very public-spirited.   There's a mop in that cupboard there."  "How much would you be willing to pay?" said Joe, who wasn't   stupid, even though he wasn't from the ABC1 social group.  "Oh no, we can't pay. We don't get enough taxes anymore because   nobody is buying or selling anything and nobody has a job. You   can use the mop for free, if you want."  "That's not quite the point," said Joe.  "Oh well. The market will have to stay dirty, then."  Joe found a queue leading up to a grand old house near the   market square.  "What's the queue for?" Joe asked a man at the back of the   queue.  "The Duchess lives here -- she's the only one with any money in   these parts and she hires people to do things for her. She takes   in ten people at a time and finds out who of them will do her   work the cheapest. Sometimes she only has to pay a few pennies   for a whole week's work."  "That's silly," said Joe.  "That's life," said the man, looking dejected.  "I'm going to find out why this has happened."  "Well," chorused the queue, "when you find out, come back and   tell us please, 'cause we're in as mighty a high dudgeon about   it as you are."  Joe sat on the steps of the market cross as the moon rose and   wondered where to start. 'The King is bound to know,' thought   Joe. 'He has more advisors than you could shake a stick at.' He   curled up in the doorway to a house and fell asleep.  2. In which Joe meets Blackberry the Squirrel.------------------------------------------------  In the early morning he set off down the road to the big city.   He had to walk through the Dark Forest, which was so big that he   had to stop in the middle to rest on a tree stump.  From within the tree stump came muffled protests. A squirrel   popped through a door and squeaked up at Joe, "Get off my roof!   Get _off_ my roof! You're cracking the ceiling, you great oaf! I   don't go 'round cracking your ceilings! Oh, look what you've   done! Look _what_ you've done! Deary me, deary _deary_ me."  "I'm sorry, Mr. Squirrel," said Joe, hastily getting off the   tree stump. "I didn't know squirrels lived in tree stumps."  "They don't usually, and the name's not Mr. Squirrel. It's   Blackberry, and I'm a Mrs."  "Oh, I am sorry."  "Never mind. If you go and get some sticks about _this_ long,"   and Blackberry gestured with her two front paws, "I'll shore up   the ceiling. Bring some white mud from the creek and some grass   too. Hurry _hurry!_"  Joe dashed into the woods to get the sticks, mud and grass for   Blackberry. When he returned, she asked him to place the sticks   inside the stump by shoving his hand through the front door   under her directions of "Left a bit, a bit more, stop, right a   bit, in a bit... that's it!"  "Why on earth do you live in a tree stump?" asked Joe.  "Some gray squirrels moved into my old neighborhood. Brought the   tone of the entire tree down -- they're not really the Oak type,   you know. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are grays,   but honestly, they are lazy, smelly thieves who have no sense of   decency. They should go back where they came from, in my view."  "Where do they come from?"  Blackberry made a _brrrrr_ noise as she thought.  "Not sure exactly. Somewhere down south, I think. What are you   doing in this neck of the woods?"  "I was looking for a living, but to do that I need to find out   why there aren't any left."  "If you humans lived like us animals then you wouldn't have this   problem. None of us ever need to look for a living."  "Yes, but lots of you animals die in gruesomely horrible ways --   disease, starvation, cold, being someone else's dinner..."  "That is a bit of a downer, I must admit. Where do you plan to   go?"  "I thought the King might know why there are no livings left."  "Perhaps, but have you tried the famous Three Economists yet?"  "No. Where are they?"  "They live in the ever-so-middlest of the forest at the top of   an Ivory Tower. They know everything, they say, and Kings and   Chancellors come from all over the world to consult them."  So Joe and Blackberry, who said she needed a holiday, set off by   hill and scented valley, down wide cart tracks, muddy paths and   hidden greenways to the Ivory Tower. The journey went on and on,   rather like most wanderings in fairy tales, and I won't bore you   with it.  3. In which Joe meets the Famous Three Economists.----------------------------------------------------  At last they came to the tower and climbed the Ivory steps to   the Ivory top where the venerable Three Economists sat reading   authoritative books on the nature of economic strategies in the   incredibly real real world in today's real world.  "Good day, venerable economists," said Joe, "I have a question   for you."  "Let's discuss the fee first," said the first economist, who was   smoking a pipe.  "Surely we can leave such vulgarities until later," said the   second economist, who was bald but had a mustache.  "I really don't think that's the issue," said the third, who   wore gold-rimmed spectacles.  "Let the boy speak," said the first economist.  "I suppose we ought to settle the fee first, actually," said the   second economist.  The third economist tutted and rolled his eyes. "The boy   manifestly has no money."  "Then he ought to go and earn some like the rest of us," said   the first economist.  Joe tried to interject but only got to say "That's..." before   the second economist interrupted.  "Perhaps that's why he's here. We've got no appointments until   three this afternoon -- why not entertain him for a while?"  "I agree wholeheartedly," said the third economist. "Except that   I have an appointment at two."  The economists sat in silence watching Joe expectantly.  Blackberry nudged Joe. "Go on, then," she whispered.  "Ah," started Joe. "I would like to know why ever and ever there   are no livings left."  "Easy-peasy," said the first economist.  "As plain as the nose on your face," said the second economist.  "Its far too complex to explain to a layman," said the third.  "The paucity of economic opportunity is a symptom of the decline   of a fat, exhausted and overpriced economy in which we have   efficiencied ourselves out of a job. Consider: A bank that used   to employ twenty cashiers now only needs two employees and a   cash machine. This makes things cheaper for the consumer until   such a point that the consumer also loses his job through   mechanization. Hence a very streamlined supply side of the   economy and eventually no demand, because everybody has been   streamlined out of the supply side, which is the side offering   all the jobs. My suggestion is that you become a machine, son."  "Nonsense," said the second economist. "We had boom-and-bust   cycles before mechanization. It's part of the natural --   possibly even invigorating -- cycles of life and death, summer   and winter, day and night. It happens and will continue to   happen. Such factors as stock market crashes, unemployment,   deflation of both economy and currency et cetera are but   symptoms of this decline, not the cause. The cause is innate in   the system -- the cause _is_ the system."  "Oh come on now," said the third economist. "The reason is that   we, meaning us the country and us the business community, have   built economic successes on ever-expanding credit. When the   debts are called in, panic ensues because nobody can pay without   calling in their debts. Everybody goes into a frenzy demanding   debts and deferring payment of their own until they go bankrupt;   confidence in the system is lost and investment slows, if not   ceases. No investment, no business, no jobs. Added to this   effect is the effect of allying our economy with Europe, whose   economies run on different lines -- when Germany decides to put   up interest rates to encourage foreign investment to pay for   their internal affairs, so do we, because we have to, to keep   our currency at the tagged rate, benefiting creditors and   damaging debtors until the debtors default and everybody goes   bust."  "Does that answer your question, son?" said the first economist.  "Which of you is right?" asked Joe.  "We all are," said the second economist.  "But you all gave different reasons. You can't all be right."  "Economics is a very complex science, a multi-layered flow of   variable interlocking currents which traverse the whole world,"   said the third economist expansively.  "Well, whose fault is all this?" asked Joe.  "Progress and capitalism," said the first economist.  "Nobody's. It's chaos theory in action," said the second   economist.  "It's the government," said the third economist.  "So how are we to get out of this hole?" asked Joe.  "Move to the far east," said the first economist.  "God only knows. Wait for a change in the weather, I suppose,"   said the second economist.  "Oh, the usual, encourage the growth of business through lower   taxes, firm currency control, a suitable interest rate and   such," said the third economist.  "So it's going to get better, then," said Joe.  "I doubt it," said the first economist. "Our economies are   overloaded galleons just waiting to capsize."  "Oh, it will, given time, but no one will know why or when,"   said the second economist.  "When the government pays back the legislative debt, undoing all   the damage of the last few years and providing a background   amenable to business," said the third economist.  "It's not surprising that the King doesn't have a clue how to   run the economy if he has you lot for advisors," said Joe.  "Harumph," said the first economist. "I am emeritus professor of   fiscal psychology at the University of Bad Znuckensitzen, I'll   have you know. Have you never heard of Europe's Ersatz TV   economist? You know, I'm on Drang nach Osten. It's particularly   popular with the Germans."  "I hold the Piaf memorial chair of Apology Negation at the   University of Sansculotte, and they don't call me Mr. Money, Our   Economist Who's Friendly and Funny for nothing," said the second   economist.  "And I am senior advisor to Herr Doktor Doktor Doktor   Gemeinschaft of Bank Swabia, Switzerland," said the third   economist. "I have a regular program on Radio Ryokaplatz beamed   across Scandinavia and the Baltic. So don't tell me my advice is   no good."  "Thank you," said Joe, who was quite polite even when dealing   with self-important second-raters.  As they descended the ivory steps Blackberry made a face.  "They weren't very useful, were they?" she said.  "Oh, I don't know. At least we know that _nobody_ has a clue   what's going on. Whom do you suggest now?"  "Let's forget about _why_ this has happened. Why not find the   famous Three Personnel Consultants and see what they have got to   say about finding a career?"  "Where do they live?" asked Joe.  "They live behind a huge wooden door with gold leaf lettering   deep in the forest which can only be found by following a narrow   winding six-lane motorway which runs in a huge circle and is   permanently clogged with slowly-shunting traffic, depressed   husbands, hysterical wives and vomiting children."  "Sounds fun," said Joe, unconvinced.  4. In which Joe meets the Famous Three Personnel Consultants.---------------------------------------------------------------  Joe knocked at the door Blackberry had led him to. On it was   written The Famous Three Personnel Consultants -- Please Knock   and Enter, so Joe did. The Famous Three Personnel Consultants   sat behind a leather-topped desk and all wore glasses and were   bald, including the woman, though she wore a wig.  "Good morning," said the leftmost Consultant. "Did you have a   good journey?"  "Well..." Joe started.  "Good, good," said the middlemost Consultant. "Did you have a   good journey?"  "Not bad..." Joe started.  "Can I take your coat?" said the rightmost and most female   consultant, the one who wore a wig.  "But I'm not wearing..." Joe started.  "Good, good," said the leftmost Consultant. He flipped over a   notepad sheet and chewed the end of his pencil. "What experience   can you bring to this post?"  Joe looked surprised. All three personnel consultants looked at   him in the friendly-yet-expectant manner they had been taught to   use, and which had driven their respective spouses to the verge   of a violent divorce.  "I, er, er," Joe thought hard. "I know how to cut down apple   trees."  There was a long and meaningful pause which was supposed to   elicit further details from the interrogee. Usually this   resulted in a stream of meaningless babble and the Consultants   knew with satisfaction that they had managed to humiliate the   quivering heap of pathetic flesh that lay damp and snickering in   front of them.  "Ye-es," said the rightmost and most female Consultant   lengthily, marking something off slowly and deliberately on her   checksheet. "In what way do you suppose the skills of arboreal   pruning can be _transferred_ to the post of filing clerk and   general dogsbody?" She stressed _transferred_ because this was   an In word and she really desperately wanted to be a fashionable   Personnel Consultant.  "None really," said Joe in a fatal flash of veracity. "Actually,   I came here to..."  "I see from your CV that you only scored 90 percent in your   end-of-term spelling test ten years ago. Why was that?" said the   leftmost Consultant.  Joe drew his brows together. "Um..."  "Don't you think you may be a little overqualified for this   post?" said the middlemost Consultant.  "Too young?" said the leftmost Consultant.  "Too old?" said the middlemost Consultant.  "Too middling?" said the rightmost and most female Consultant.  There was another pregnant-yet-sympathetic pause. Joe was lost.  "No, I don't think so," he said.  They flipped their notepads and marked something down.  "I see you have done a lot of travelling," said the leftmost   Consultant.  "A bit, here and there," said Joe.  "Aha! Do you really think you are ready to settle down now?"   said the rightmost and most female Consultant with a   doubtful-but-questioning set of the nose.  "That's good; it shows _initiative_," said the middlemost   Consultant, using his most favorite word.  "Where do you see yourself in ten years' time?" asked the   rightmost and most female consultant.  "I don't," said Joe firmly. There ensued another nailbitingly   firm-but-approachable pause.  "I see," said the middlemost Consultant. "We have five other   candidates to see today. Why should we choose you?"  "Five thousand actually," said the leftmost Consultant.  "Five million actually," said the rightmost and most female   Consultant.  "All of whom have years and years of exactly the experience we   want, at least two degrees, are under nineteen years old,   willing to work for peanuts and all the hours that God gives.   They have no family, mortgage or social life and are driven only   by the terror of poverty. What can you offer?"  "I've got most of those, except the experience and the two   degrees," said Joe.  "We don't really need the two degrees, actually," admitted the   middlemost Consultant, "but it appears a slightly less random   method of choosing than pinning on a donkey's tail."  "What we really need is someone who has spent twenty years   filing in gray steel cabinets and making five cups of coffee,   two white only, two with sugar only and one with both every half   an hour at 17 minutes past and 13 minutes to the hour except   during lunch and who is under nineteen, and preferably pliant,"   said the leftmost Consultant.  "But that's not possible," said Joe.  "Ah, but you see, there are five million people out there to   choose from. There's bound to be someone." said the rightmost   and most female Consultant.  "Then they're lying," said Joe.  "I think _we_ can tell a liar when we see one, young man," said   the leftmost Consultant in some dudgeon.  "I think you misunderstand our purpose. You think we're here to   _employ_ people don't you?" said the middlemost Consultant.  "Well, aren't you?" said Joe. The Consultants laughed in the   friendly-yet-pedagogical manner they had refined through their   years of overvalued employment.  "Oh, no," said the rightmost and most female Consultant. "We are   concerned with _not_ employing people and when they are   employed, with _not_ sacking them. Out of the many options we   have to pick the best. For instance, we have to glance through   several hundred CVs for each post; the ones with spelling   mistakes are immediately discarded. We don't have enough time to   check any deeper."  "If you don't have time, how come you can check for spelling   mistakes?" said Joe.  "We have time enough for that," snapped the middlemost   Consultant.  "So you are being entirely negative in your search then?" said   Joe.  "Oh, no, no" they chorused. "No, oh no." _Negative_ was a deeply   unfashionable word in personnel circles, like _luck_ and   _mistake_.  "We choose on the basis of instinct," said the leftmost   Consultant. "You can't buck human nature. Our decision is made   within the first three minutes of meeting the applicant."  "What, depending on whether they're pretty or not?" said Joe.  "I wouldn't put it _exactly_ like that," said the rightmost and   most female Consultant. The other Consultants waited politely   for her to say how _exactly_ she would put it, but she didn't.  "So what's the point in the pseudo-science of personnel if it   comes down to basic instincts anyway?"  The Consultants shuffled uncomfortably. "We have to choose   _some_ way. I think we have more refined instincts than most and   understand people better," said the middlemost Consultant.  "I beg to differ there," said Joe. "It's incontrovertible that   some incompetents do get hired and some talented, hard-working   people don't."  "But it's inevitable that some mistakes occur. We don't claim to   be superhuman," said the leftmost Consultant.  "By that logic," said Joe, "air traffic controllers should be   forgiven causing a few aircraft to collide. The difference is   that air traffic control is an applied science with objective   standards, and personnel is a load of baloney. To make matters   worse, it's not merely a matter of a _few_ incompetents in jobs   and a few of the unfortunate talented out of work, it's   thousands, if not millions."  Joe was now warming to his subject. "And those incompetents make   the employment situation worse precisely because they're   incompetent at running an efficient business. It often seems   that the only qualification required to get a high-powered job   is that you should be a self-seeking grasping liar with   connections in the right places who is willing to acquiesce to   any of the notions of your direct boss, however daft or   fraudulent."  The Consultants licked their lips nervously. "I thought _we_   were conducting the interview. You're not keeping to the   commonly accepted standards of interview techniques," said the   rightmost and most female consultant.  "Are you saying, then, that personnel selection procedures are   no better than random?" asked the leftmost Consultant.  "Worse," said Joe. "Because the specifications on which someone   is hired is uniformly arbitrary and _not_ random. For instance   you won't hire young women because they might get pregnant."  "Well, it's _possible__," said the rightmost and most female   Consultant a bit wistfully.  "You won't hire people over 50, presumably because only extreme   youth is fashionable and, by definition, you will only hire   people who can be totally at ease when under scrutiny -- which   indicates that the candidate is good at either job interviews or   lying, and those who do not qualify are permanently   unemployable."  "We have to use _some_ method," said the middlemost Consultant.  "But does it have to be uniformly the same one?"  "We must keep up to date in the incredibly competitive world of   today," said the leftmost Consultant. "In any case, if our   procedures didn't work, nobody would employ us. Businesses   aren't stupid, you know."  "But who checks? How can anyone check? You can't admit to a   mistake because you want to keep your job too and no businessman   is going to admit that all his staff were hired incompetently.   Businesses can thrive without personnel departments, you know."  "But only small ones," said the middlemost Consultant.  "Is there any evidence at all that your recruitment methods are   any better than random methods?"  There was another uncomfortable pause during which all three   coughed nervously.  "Thank you for taking the time to come," said the middlemost   Consultant.  "I'm afraid the post has already been filled," said the   rightmost and most female consultant.  "I'm afraid we will have to postpone recruitment until next   year. Do try again," said the leftmost Consultant.  The Consultants started marking things down on their checksheets   and flipping notes backward and forward.  "That's it," said Blackberry. "Pretty useless, eh?"  Joe got up from the extremely uncomfortable squeaky swivel chair   he had been sitting on.  "That's not so surprising, is it?" said Joe. "After all, it was   people like this who recruited other people like this to run big   companies."  As he left the office, a secretary passed him a note. "From the   Personnel Consultants," she said, chewing her chewing gum   noisily.  It read:    "To find a job you must:     Look for a job tailored to your experience.     Sell yourself.     (Your expectations are too high.     You have no self-confidence.)"  "But I haven't got any experience to tailor anything to!" said   Joe. "And why should I sell myself? Isn't that just smooth   lying? I've never claimed to be a salesman and never wanted a   sales job. My expectation is just to get a job; is that too   high? If I have no self-confidence, isn't that because I can't   even fulfill the basic expectation of getting a job?"  "Don't have conniptions," said Blackberry. "That's what they   want. They want you to feel it's all your fault because then   they won't have to do anything about it. Let's try the three   politicians."  "Politicians?" said Joe. "Oh dear."  5. In which Joe meets the Famous Three Politicians.-----------------------------------------------------  The Famous Three Politicians lived in a beautiful neo-gothic   palace on the banks of a big river. Joe was directed down dark,   wallpapered corridors, past wooden trifolium ornamentation and   over-luxurious woolen carpets toward a broad double door behind   which could be heard the sound of a convention of axe-murderers.  "Tres William Morris," said Blackberry admiringly from Joe's   pocket as she eyed up the dark green organic design on the   walls.  "Ordah ordah!" shouted someone. The noise continued. "Oh, fer   chrissake shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Please!"  Joe opened the door.  "Did so!" shouted a man in a suit.  "Did not!" shouted another.  "Didididididididididididid!" shouted the first.  "Didndidndidndidndidn't!" shouted the other.  "I'll agree with anyone who'll agree with me," said a third.  "Oh, shut up," said the other two.  "I will not have such language..." started a woman with a blue   rinse from the back of the playpen.  "Go stick it in your ear," said the first.  "Whaddayou want?" asked the second, facing Joe.  "A job, actually," said Joe.  "Well stop whining and go and look for one!" said the first,   cursing as he dropped his briefcase and thousands of stock   certificates slid out.  "See! See!" said the second. "You see what happens when you vote   _his_ lot in!"  "I didn't," said Joe. "I was too young to vote the last time. I   wanted to know why I can't get a job."  "You bloody well get on your bike and look for one," said the   first politician."  "I don't have a bike," said Joe.  "Then buy one."  "I don't have any money, and in any case employers don't just   employ people who turn up on their doorsteps anymore," said Joe.  "Oh piss off, you whining git," said the first politician. "Get   a job and get out of my face."  "I can't," said Joe.  "There's no such thing as can't. You just don't want to. You'd   rather tramp to and fro across the country in an endless and   futile search for a fictional excuse for not getting a job. I   bet my _honorable_ colleague opposite would oblige you with one   of those," he sneered at the second politician. "You people make   me sick. Don't you see?" He waved his hands around in an   encompassing gesture. "We have created a meritocratic paradise.   If you can't make it here, you can't make it anywhere."  "Piffle!" said the second politician. "Codswallop! As there is   profit in employment, there has to be profit in unemployment. If   you voted for me, the whole world would join hands and sing in   peaceful harmony..."  "Tripe!" said the first politician. "Nobody believes or trusts   you. The economy would collapse within days of you assuming   power!"  "Only because you and your friends would sabotage it!"  "Doesn't matter _why_, it just would. Who'd trust you with a   penny? You get in and I'm on a plane to Bermuda along with all   my money. And as for you, young man," he looked at Joe, "there   is no such thing as unemployment. There is merely an   unwillingness to match one's self to the requirements of the   marketplace. What do you want me to do? Cry? Piss off. I'm not   interested."  "If we had been in power," said the second, "you wouldn't be in   this state. Blame yourself."  "But..." said Joe.  You're not worth the breath it takes to ignore you," said the   first politician. "Let's face it, you're an irrelevant whining   scrounger with no money, no job, no vote, no prospects, no   connections and no point. Goodbye. And as for you, you corrupt   incompetent..."  "Who exactly are you calling a corrupt incompetent, you   self-satisfied upper class oaf?"  "How _dare_ you..."  Joe turned away from the playpen and made his own way out.  "They say that the incidence of suicide is on the increase," Joe   said to Blackberry.  Blackberry shrugged. "You should have been born a squirrel," she   said.  6. In which the gentle reader decides what happens to Joe.------------------------------------------------------------  So what did happen to Joe? Well, there are a number of   possibilities. Armed with your knowledge and experience choose   from the following:**a)** As Joe plodded dejectedly toward the center of town, a   long black car pulled up. A businessman wound down the window   from the back seat.  "Exactly what I've been looking for!" he said.  "Pardon?" said Joe.  "Do you want a job?" said the businessman.  "Well, er, yes," said Joe.  The businessman handed Joe his card. Montague Twistleton-Smythe,   Chartered Odd-Job man to the Astonishingly Rich. "Be at that   address tomorrow morning at nine. Twenty thousand a year.   Company Car. Stock Options. All we need is your brains," he   said.  "Wow," said Joe. "It's like a fairy tale."  "Either that, or you've finally lost it," said Blackberry.   "Otherwise I wouldn't still be here."**b)** Joe plodded dejectedly back into town to find the dole   office.  "Help," he said to the official there.  The official sighed. "Are you now or have you ever been   unemployed?" he said.  "Yup," said Joe, "and I'm broke."  "Well, find someplace to stay, and we'll pay you."  So Joe found the friends that everyone is supposed to have in   the big city and persuaded them to let him sleep on the floor so   he could get the dole. Then the landlady found out and he was   kicked out, along with the rest of his friends, one of whom had   a job and so could rent another place. Gosh, that was lucky.  Being an unemployed young male, no landlord would offer him a   room, so in the end Joe had to give up and go home, where he   lived for years and years until he had no spirit left and   certainly had nothing to sell to the marketplace.**c)** Joe plodded dejectedly back into town to find the dole   office.  "Help," he said to the official there.  The official sighed. "Are you now or have you ever been   unemployed?" he said.  "Yup," said Joe, "and I'm broke."  "Well, find a place to stay and we'll pay you."  "I see a fatal flaw in that plan," said Joe.  "Not my problem," said the official.  So Joe slept underneath a bridge until the police hosed his box   into the river. He lived off handouts and whisky, indulging in   the odd bit of theft and buggery until his brain had been   pickled and he smelled so bad and looked so ugly that nobody   gave a tinker's damn about what happened to him. Even the   well-meaning liberals didn't bother wringing their hands in   sympathy.  Mind you, all that whisky and dodgy crack had meant he could now   converse with Blackberry the talking Squirrel. In fact, he saw   her everywhere.  So next time you come across a man looking haggard and unshaven   holding a whisky bottle in one hand tottering underneath a   bridge and slurring "Ay! 'Vyer seen Blackbree, 'vyer, ay?" then   do say hello from me, won't you?  Adam Harrington <adam.harrington@btinternet.com>--------------------------------------------------  Despite the impression you might get from his story, Adam   Harrington is happily employed as a computer contractor in   England. He has been a biologist, journalist, unemployed bum,   bookie's clerk and unemployed bum again -- in that order -- and   doesn't plan on retiring until his cold dead fingers are pried   from the office doorknob.  The Year Before Sleep   by Rupert Goodwins============================================....................................................................  Losing yourself in your work is fine, so long as you remember to   come back.....................................................................  Cecil spun his web lazily, hooking it between branches and   thorns, leaves and flakes of bark. It was early in the morning,   and he was still too cold to shake off the waking sluggishness   in his mind and limbs. He watched sun-slivered color glint   through dewdrops, watched green translucence creep down   shadow-dipped grass stems next to the bramble bush.   Eventually, the sun touched his head, then his back. His body   warmed, the plump abdomen contracting and expanding as energy   pumped through it. Gradually, the world around him grew and the   thirty-two aches in his thirty-two joints melted away. He was   alert now.  The web needed tidying. He tidied it, scuttling across it to a   ragged corner, a sulking gap near the top, a clumsy anchor on a   bramble bud.  That should do. Now, wait.  The dewdrops had gone by midday. Cecil sheltered under a leaf:   it was a clear day and there was rather too much sun. One leg   lightly touched a strand of the web; through it he could hear   his prey distantly moving through the air. Always too distant,   he thought. He wasn't hungry exactly, but he would be in a   couple of days and he didn't want to have to move. Still time to   wait.  The afternoon passed. One small blue fast-flying blur snapped   into the web, but snapped away again almost before Cecil was out   from under the leaf. He scrambled out to inspect the damage;   there was a ragged hole that couldn't be fixed neatly. He did   the best he could, and slunk back again.  Then, just as the sun touched the top of the scrubby trees at   the far end of the clearing, he got a hit. He heard it coming: a   deep, slow buzz that made him remember with pleasure a   particularly succulent catch from weeks ago. With delight, he   noted that the buzz was getting steadily louder. It must be   heading straight for him, he thought, and then it was in the   net. The twig he was on bent slightly with the impact; he was   out in no time, cautiously circling the victim. This one wasn't   going to get away.  It was trying, though. The web bounced and strained, vibrating   with the prey's frantic bursts of motion. Cecil watched it   warily: it didn't seem to be the sort with a sting, and he   couldn't see anything too much like dangerous jaws. He checked   the tension on the web: it was good. He could wait until it   tired itself out a little more.  That took quite a long time, and the air was cooling before he   tried a quick rush over the body. It was still buzzing, but   quietly now, intermittently. One track of web over it, then   another, then another. Then in for the kill: he bit, feeling his   fangs make contact with the body, then through and into it. A   pump of venom. A final twitch. He quickly mummified it with a   single layer of web, then cut it clear of the holding strands   before tumbling it over and over with his hind legs, weaving a   thick, glistening cover. It was bigger than he was even before   he finished.  Satisfied with his work, he dragged it back to his haunt under   the leaf, sticking it carefully to the junction with the twig.   Night was no time to do anything. He'd wait until morning, then   consume his meal and think -- yes, definitely -- about moving to   a new site.  When daylight touched the world about him, everything seemed as   it should be. Things to do formed in his night-slowed mind.   Repair the web, or move. Eat. Yes, eat. He shuddered with slow   waking, and made to move toward the waiting package.  He didn't move. He tried again; his complaining legs made the   right aches, his body bumped away from the twig, but slumped   back down again. His legs strained harder. Something was holding   them fast. There came a colder thought, paralysing him just by   the shapes it made in his head -- wasps! He knew of them; the   memory of them had always been there. Small things, predatory,   always hungry, who flew at night and laid their eggs in living   flesh, leaving it aware and immobile. Was that it?  "No, we're not wasps."  Cecil had enjoyed a long and successful life. He had survived   many of the dangers that could wipe out the toothsome; had   hidden and run, had outwitted most of the rapaciously hungry   animals that would otherwise have added him to their list of   meals consumed. He had seen three seasons, been flooded, baked,   blown away by the wind and nearly frozen. Never, in all this,   had he ever had a thought that was not his own. The shock of it   held him tight as any bright-eyed mouse.  "Come on, Cecil. You're no spider. We're no fly. Look up, look   at yesterday's catch."  He still couldn't separate out these alien voices from his own;   but if a thought said "look up," you should look up. He looked   at the bundle of sticky thread on the twig. It was as he   remembered it.  Except.  Except there was a neat hole halfway up, perfectly round. There   was something dark sticking out of it, and a bright red thread   ran from the hole to the twig. It ended up in a neat loop,   encircling the twig and two of his legs, holding them fast   together. Then it ran under his body. He couldn't see where it   ended.  "That's it. Talk to us, Cecil."  The shock subsided. He thought back at the voices. "What are   you? How are you in me? You are wasps. You will kill me."  "Not wasps. Friends. Cecil, we've been looking for you. We were   worried."  "Friends. Worried. No, no, no. Wasps." Cecil hadn't ever thought   much about what it would be like to be a living host to wasps.   Not something to dwell on. But now he thought about it; it must   be like this. Once the eggs were in your body, their thoughts   must be in your mind. Made sense. Horrid sense. He wished he'd   eaten the fly last night now. A last meal to keep him going a   bit longer.  "Forget the wasps, Cecil!" The voice was louder. Sounded quite   upset.  "...wasps..." he mumbled, trying to see if he could feel where   the eggs were. Everything felt normal. The sun would be on him   soon. Perhaps he'd have the strength to get to the fly then.  "It's not a fly! Oh, for heaven's sake..." There was an   indistinct conversation. He caught the odd phrase: "How much   more damage can we do? He thinks he's an orb spider, for..."   "Well, why not?" Then it went quiet. Cecil waited, for sunlight   or for death.  "Cecil. Cecil Sharpley."  The last word hit him as the sun touched his head. A burst of   light, inside and out.  "Frederic." he said. "Cecil Frederic Sharpley. That's me."  "Well done! Cecil, this is Greerly. We're here to get you..."   But his mind was filled with babble; he was quite unable to tell   what was his, what was the voice. The noises merged, collided,   fell apart. He felt his body vibrate, his legs pumping him up   and down, escape the bird that way, escape the bird that way,   escape...  Inside his mind, a burning. A man came awake. A thirty-seven   year old man, warm, with a wife, with a fascination for   arachnids. A man who made models, a man who wanted to make, who   made, the ultimate field trip. A man who got lost, who forgot   the way out of the field. A man who went to sleep, and woke up   one day not as a man, who slept again.  Now he was awake. Just for a second. Just long enough to feel   the spider body around him and, in the distance, a body that had   been home. He felt the thorax with the legs sprouting from it   bursting through his chest, the distended abdomen where his   stomach was, the mess of fangs and eyes and hair merging with   his warm, smooth, man's face. An excruciating ugliness that the   sunlight could never warm.  Later that afternoon, an ichneumon wasp found the spider. It   settled on the leaf above it, and carefully made its way down,   antennae scanning. But the body was cold and had already started   to decay. Unsuited for the purpose.  There would be others.  The wasp flew away.  Rupert Goodwins <rupertgo@aol.com>------------------------------------  Large, shambling, ground-dwelling primate.
