  FirstText  by Jason Snell
===========================

  Welcome to InterText, the new net magazine devoted (well, I'd 
  like to think it will be devoted) to the publication of fiction.

  First off, I'd like to thank Jim McCabe, the man who produced 
  Athene, for all the work he did on that magazine.

  This magazine takes its place, and I hope that you will all find 
  the stories we publish to be entertaining and thought-provoking. 
  Publishing a commercial magazine is a risky business -- 
  electronically publishing a non-commercial magazine is risky and 
  essentially untried. The only similar magazine that publishes in 
  both ASCII and PostScript(TM) format in the United States that I 
  know of is Daniel Appelquist's QUANTA, which has been published 
  since Fall, 1989. (The other netmagazines are DARGONZINE, which 
  is distributed in ASCII format only, and the GUILDSMAN, a 
  roleplaying journal.)

  First, a little bit about myself: I'm a Junior at Revelle 
  College at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in 
  Communication with a minor in Literature/Writing. I've been 
  writing fiction since I was in elementary school, though none of 
  it has been professionally published yet. Of course, I haven't 
  submitted any of it, so there's nobody to blame but myself.

  In addition to my schoolwork, I put in a ridiculous amount of 
  time at UCSD's school newspaper, the Guardian. I'm in my second 
  year at the paper, and I'm the News Editor.

  What do I expect from this magazine? All I really want to do is 
  bring good stories to the people who subscribe. I'll be hunting 
  down stories on any subject from all over the network, and 
  hopefully we can put out an issue every two months. I'm hoping 
  to alternate with the publication schedule of QUANTA, so the two 
  magazines will dovetail into a semi-monthly production schedule.

  QUANTA, if you didn't know, is a bi-monthly net magazine -- and 
  its specialty is Science Fiction. InterText, on the other hand, 
  is for all kinds of fiction. I don't mind publishing SF here, 
  but since Quanta is an established magazine with a specific 
  format, I'd expect most of the SF to go there.

  Then again, since people who use the net seem to be forward- 
  thinking in nature, I wouldn't be surprised to find that there's 
  so much SF out there that I end up running quite a bit of it. It 
  doesn't matter what kind of fiction appears in InterText... it's 
  up to you.

  Within this issue you'll find an interesting collection of 
  stories, to say the least. A few stories (but not as many as I 
  had hoped) fell into my lap for this issue, including two from 
  Quanta's Dan Appelquist, one by myself, and one by my Assistant 
  Editor Phil Nolte. Still, I'd hope that InterText won't be 
  dominated by "editor- writers", and so I encourage everyone to 
  submit their fiction. There are some stories (especially non-SF 
  stories) that have no other net outlet, and so you might still 
  see stories by editors here, but we'll try to keep it to a 
  minimum.

  (For example, next issue I'll probably end up running another 
  story written by me, just because it's not SF and so I can't 
  really get it into Quanta.)

  Dan Appelquist's "Anticipation of the Night" is a fascinating 
  piece of work... quite strange, yes, but very interesting. His 
  other story, "A War in the Sand," was sort of written because of 
  the cover of the PostScript version of this issue. (The cover is 
  a drawing of a dove of peace sitting atop a tank in the middle 
  of the desert.) I sent Dan a template of InterText that jokingly 
  listed a story called "War in the Sand." I guess Dan took me up 
  on it. Anyway, those stories and the closing pieces by Greg 
  Knauss ("The Talisman," a loopy Stephen King parody, and 
  "Schrodinger's Monkey," a deep contemplation of quantum 
  mechanics and bananas) form what I'd like to think of as a pair 
  of strange bookends: two to welcome you to this first issue and 
  two to wrap it up.

  In between are Nolte's "Direct Connections," (which we're 
  printing under sad circumstances -- Phil gave it to me only 
  after _Amazing Stories_ rejected it), a story by me, and stories 
  by Andrea Payne and Mary Anne Walters. I thank everyone for 
  submitting and helping me out with this issue.

  Some people have asked about an FTP site for back issues of this 
  magazine, and for those who'd rather not have the issue pop up 
  in their mailer. Well, with great thanks to Brian Kantor of UCSD 
  Network Operations, InterText will have an FTP site on 
  network.ucsd.edu. Look in the "intertext" directory (of course).

  Before I go, I'd like to thank everyone who helped out with the 
  creation of this magazine. It has been three months since I 
  began working on this magazine, and many people have 
  contributed.

  I'd like to thank Dan Appelquist for giving me help on how to 
  distribute the magazine and for testing the validity of my 
  PostScript code, zoetrop@ucscb.ucsc.edu for giving me a program 
  that corrected a major PostScript problem, Jim McCabe for his 
  help in easing the transition and allowing me to use the Athene 
  mailing list, _Guardian_ Design Editor James Collier both for 
  saying he liked the InterText PostScript edition design and for 
  taking the picture of me that appears on page three of the 
  PostScript version, and, of course, my assistant editors Geoff 
  Duncan and Phil Nolte.

  And thanks to all of you for subscribing to the magazine. Feel 
  free to send us letters with your comments about things we 
  should change, things we shouldn't, and anything else you'd like 
  to know. Geoff, Phil, and I will be sure to listen.

  Oh, three final notes. First: there will be an FTP site for 
  recent issues of InterText. The host will be network.ucsd.edu, 
  and both postscript and ASCII editions will be located in the 
  "intertext" directory on that system.

  Second: If you do have the ability to print this magazine to a 
  laserprinter, I urge you to try FTPing a PotScript edition of 
  this magazine and printing it. In ASCII you get the bare bones, 
  but the PostScript version is easier to read and (for this 
  issue) runs 29 pages in length. It also has a neat cover 
  graphic, as mentioned above.

  Third: I'd like to know who I have reading this magazine, and 
  how many of you there are. If you receive this magazine by some 
  other route than via direct mail (i.e., through a server or via 
  ftp), please drop me a message saying that you do. I'll put you 
  on a "notification list", letting you know that the new issue is 
  out and you can expect it coming through the mail and showing up 
  on the ftp site. This way, I can keep in contact with you and 
  know how many of you there are. Thanks. And enjoy the magazine.


  A War In the Sand  by Daniel K. Appelquist
============================================

  Last night I heard rockets. The sound was a familiar one, but it 
  still somehow manages to grab hold of my spine. I lay there, on 
  my concrete bed, shaking, trying not to think of tomorrow. I 
  can't say where the rockets were coming from, or where they were 
  going to. I heard no explosions last night, but perhaps it would 
  have been better if I had. The explosions of the past few nights 
  somehow had the intensity to jar me out of the realm of 
  conscious thought, turning me into a creature of mere instinct, 
  my will to survive primary. The sounds of rockets only made me 
  think harder about who I was, where I was and when the madness 
  would end.

  Last week, my cousin and aunt left, setting out on the long trek 
  across the plain, the no man's land. I don't think I will ever 
  see them again. I don't know why I didn't go with them. It had 
  nothing to do with pride, nothing to do with a love of country. 
  Perhaps it was the nagging thought that an escape from the place 
  I have called home would constitute its ultimate destruction. I 
  have no wish to become a refugee, to abandon all I have known, 
  to become a nameless no-one, fleeing like a cockroach from a 
  burning building.

  I have heard a rumor that the tanks of the enemy are on their 
  way, rolling in a ceaseless procession through the vast desert 
  sands. If they arrive, they will find no resistance here, in 
  this pile of broken concrete, once a town. I welcome them now -- 
  not because they are right, but because they represent an end, a 
  bringing to a close of this ungodly catastrophe. I will greet 
  them with open arms.

  This morning, there was smoke on the horizon, a column of dark 
  grey painted on a backdrop of lighter grey. Grey is a color I 
  have become well acquainted with of late. The very air here is 
  thick with a grey soot, a residue from past bombings. A rain 
  will sometimes wash the air, leaving it clear for an hour or 
  two, until the bombs return and the cycle begins again. Lately, 
  there have been no bombings, but neither has there been any 
  rain, so the dust remains, settling only slowly onto the already 
  debris-laden ground.

  I went in search of food today, thinking that I might find some 
  bottled water, some canned fish. All I found was a ripped 
  child's cover-all, stained with blood. I stood there for a long 
  while, trying to remember who had lived there, who the small 
  owner of this garment might have been. Discouraged, I returned 
  to my shelter, the basement of some now unrecognizable building.

  When I reached the entrance to my shelter, I found a small boy 
  on his way out, shirtless, obviously under-nourished, clutching 
  as many of my supplies as he could carry in the tattered remains 
  of a turban. I was enraged, beyond all reason. I struck him, I 
  don't know how many times, I think I saw in him all that was 
  wrong with us, all the weaknesses that had brought this calamity 
  upon us. After the child ran away, screaming, I sat down in the 
  middle of the scattered cans the child had dropped and cried. I 
  had been reduced to my own object of hatred in that moment. What 
  monsters are we men. Our civilization is pretense. Our science, 
  a sham. Our kindness, a convenience. We would build sprawling 
  empires out of dust.

  But when the bombs begin to drop, all our false faces drop with 
  them. Carefully constructed worlds crumble noiselessly at our 
  feet. I stood there in the street for a long time, looking up at 
  the sky, silently cursing God for bringing us to this, then 
  cursing myself.

  The engine-roar of a formation of war planes shrieking overhead 
  brought me out of my reverie. How like birds they were, I 
  thought. How graceful in their movements. How awesome in flight. 
  No. Not birds. Birds do not rain destruction upon cities and 
  towns. As if to answer my thoughts, a group of vultures ascended 
  in rapid, flapping chaos from behind a mound of earth. I did not 
  look to see what their quarry had been. Perhaps a friend. 
  Perhaps a relative. I bid them a silent farewell, picked up my 
  cans and descended into my shelter.

  Now, I wait for the tanks, for the soldiers. There is no 
  feeling, only a vast, empty nothingness in my head. Now I hear 
  the rockets again, and now the explosions. Why have I bothered? 
  I should have let the child get away with my cans. The 
  nourishment that now keeps my brain alive would have gone to 
  much better use in his mouth. Perhaps his thoughts would weigh 
  not so heavily upon his brow. I wonder when they will come for 
  me, when the fire from the skies will finally seek out my safe 
  haven and make a mockery of my fight for survival. Now? Now?

  Now.



  Anticipation of the Night  by Dan Appelquist
==============================================

  Satan, the wiles of the immaculate beast return yet to further 
  trouble my already derided spirit. And what should I have 
  expected, I in my innermost protected sanctum, the fire light of 
  those withered memories casting a pale black shadow upon my 
  craggy pock-marked face.

  It was only here, in the tower I created with my own pride, my 
  foolish arrogance, that I felt truly safe, and it was here that 
  the battle over my soul, having been planned and replanned for 
  centuries, was finally fought, and lost. I say this in no 
  uncertain terms, mind you. I have succumbed to that hate, that 
  uncontrollable desire to which all pretend innocence. I have 
  made my peace with it and in doing so I have surrendered, the 
  half-truths of my life becoming full lies, at least now honest 
  in their untruthfulness. I look upon others, those who pretend 
  an existence apart from evil, apart from that which controls, 
  that which contorts, and I laugh. In a corner of my heart I long 
  for that time, the time of ignorance, of blindness punctuated by 
  a joy so foreign to me now that I think I would not recognize 
  it, or would mistake it for pain or anguish.

  Call me, then, Jeremiah. I am a man, and yet my heart is the 
  heart of the beast, the heart of the man before Man. My only 
  hunger now is the burning Lack, that which drives me on to 
  commit atrocity after atrocity in hope of fulfillment. The time 
  of my mortal hunger has long passed. My corporeal nourishment 
  provided to me by mechanisms and bodily subterfuge, I cheat 
  Death of her prize quite glibly. Mine is the best life money can 
  buy.

  Ah Death, how fair you are, and yet how you must despise me for 
  putting off our wedding date so rudely and so often. We will be 
  joined, Death, you and I -- but not yet. I have a little 
  business to attend to first.

  And so in the first year of this, a new eon on Earth, I sit, 
  awake, for, in this state, even sleep is robbed from my hardly 
  human body. They come to me, my minions, my demons, and show me 
  things, proofs of their atrocious acts, their foulness reeking 
  through my mind as their memories become absorbed into my own. 
  For them, I have become a bank, a God, and father confessor, 
  rolled into an incongruous one. How they must revere me, my 
  minions. They come to me to deposit their memories, and by doing 
  so to share their experiences, thus to make each act they commit 
  sacred in some small way. A link -- to transcend prayer, talk, 
  all earthly modes of expression and cut to the quick. In the 
  instant I sense their waking thoughts (unable to truly break 
  through, to take ACTION!) I become more than myself, and I sense 
  them becoming part of me, their life stories only sub-plots of 
  my own. Perhaps some of them think they control me, perhaps they 
  think they use me for their own purposes, but in their hearts, 
  they fear.

  'Jerem', they call me: 'The Reawakened'. My throne, a bed where 
  my wasting body, beyond atrophy, sits vestigially, omnipotent. 
  From there, I sit and relate to them visions of times long past, 
  of things long forgotten; of days when men of power, ruling with 
  steel fists, would stare eye to eye, knowing that even a flinch 
  would silence a million voices, even the memories of whom would 
  be reduced to a puff of smoke. There were such men, and I was 
  among them. My memory of those days is crystal clear. I can lose 
  myself in those memories and I often do, letting the players of 
  my mind act out scenes from my past. It is only the most recent 
  of memories that I now find strangely obscured, no doubt the 
  product of my decrepit brain -- ah what a fair instrument you 
  have been.

  Some have said that the Brain is not the true center of one's 
  soul; that in this explanation there is no beauty, no harmony to 
  show God's divine influence. They know nothing. Within the 
  beautiful symmetry of the Brain is the ability to have such 
  thoughts, such awful, grinding examples of mortality, that even 
  I have been loath to look upon them. I have known Brains, oh 
  yes. So many that they defy counting. The myth of the mind, that 
  attempt by man to raise his faculties above the level of a 
  simple chemical reaction, beyond nerve and synapse, is his last, 
  greatest lie to himself. There is no mind, only the Brain, that 
  juicy repository of all that makes us truly and grittily human, 
  even to the last.

  It is not man we are truly searching for but the image of man, 
  which is embellished within our consciousness through re-telling 
  and re-telling. It is that archetypal hero for which we forever 
  search, unable to come to terms, finally and satisfactorily with 
  the idea that he does not exist, or has died away. In the time 
  of death, perhaps, we come to this realization and grasp for 
  life to be reborn into this new knowledge, but by then it is too 
  late, the dying embers of our past cannot kindle anew the fire 
  of our forbidden future. We are consigned to once more trace the 
  same circle, forever going back and forth without ever truly 
  knowing ourselves or those around us. For all real purposes, 
  blind, deaf and dumb.

  In my false death, my trickery, I have surpassed that terrible 
  knowledge. I no longer search for man or for any sort of earthly 
  fulfillment, save the one single sinking Purpose. See them 
  gather around me in futile hope that they might absorb a measure 
  of greatness, of ultimate power: my acolytes, my priests.

  Once, I was possessed of earthly flesh, but that flesh has 
  melted away. It exists, and yet it does so only as a 
  convenience. Once my emotions were such that oftentimes I would 
  close my eyes and weep inwardly, or smile the smile of true 
  happiness. There is nothing that delights me now. I remember 
  when I awoke, after they had taken my body from its cryogenic 
  crypt. "Lead us," they had pleaded, those elite, those men of 
  power. "Bring us power, for in the ways of distrust, we are mere 
  pupils. You are the professor-professor."

  I resented them at first. I thought them mad to bring me back. I 
  did not want this Godhood that was being foisted upon me, so 
  fresh out of the grave. But it was too late. I had been deified 
  long before my awakening. I remember my morbid fascination with 
  the texts that described my deeds of life. How inaccurate they 
  often were, and sometimes how stunningly correct. They knew 
  truths that had been kept, I thought, only between myself and my 
  own inner confessor, but of my own inner thoughts they knew 
  nothing. Thus my re-awakening, my bane. That I should have been 
  brought back into this world, this never-ending pain.

  How I resisted, then, and how they fought me. They did not ever 
  openly oppose me, but their expectations were a ladder, each 
  rung bringing more protestations, yet still leading downwards 
  into unknown abysses. I know now that I was true evil from the 
  moment lucky sperm met unexpectant egg.

  And then, resigned to a life such as they had planned, I 
  resolved myself to change this world, this ruined landscape of 
  man's blind stupidity. "Has man not reached the stars?" I asked 
  them in my foolishness. "A foolish dream." they replied. "The 
  planets, then, what of the colonies, teeming with fresh insight, 
  noble spirit and purpose," to which they replied "there never 
  were such places. There never was such a spirit." And in that 
  moment, I despaired. I thought then, in my ambition, that I 
  would bring about a change, a tornado of progress that would 
  shake the foundations of the earth. I was, instead, drawn into 
  the whirlpool of an ever decaying, dead planet.

  Now, my minions leave my fatherly care, to destroy, to rape 
  whatever still exists in this filthy, dying world, to release 
  the dragons. Ah, my sweet Delores, if only you could see me now. 
  When I killed you I kept you with me throughout all time, 
  forever reinventing your immaculate psyche. Now they release the 
  Gorgon. Split the fragile egg of your own birthplace. Return its 
  dust to that which, in a child's breath, created all that now 
  is. I know you truly, now, Death. I am your angel. Encircle me 
  with your eager arms and let us embrace.

  Direct Connection  by Phil Nolte
==================================

  A Whitman's sampler lay with its lid open on the coffee table. 
  Inside, a jumble of dark brown waxed paper cups lay empty and in 
  disarray. In fact, only four of the little cups still contained 
  their chocolate coated treasures. Janis mentally scolded herself 
  for having eaten most of the bottom layer in one sitting.

  "You're gonna miss your target weight for this week, Janis," she 
  sighed, thinking aloud. Still, chocolate was her only 
  indulgence, one she occasionally resorted to for solace, 
  especially after a particularly trying day. Like this one had 
  been. Her hand hovered over the box for a moment as she decided 
  which of the remaining morsels looked the most appealing. 
  Finally she selected one and bit into it, savoring the rich, 
  dark chocolate. Ah, a coconut center, one of her favorites!

  Janis Tolbert was alone in her efficiency apartment, sprawled 
  out on the old beat-up sofa, still dressed in her work outfit, a 
  smart, no-nonsense navy blue skirt and white blouse that still 
  looked reasonably fresh in spite of having been worn all day. 
  She had her shoes off and her panty hose-clad legs propped up on 
  the table. The boxed remains of a take-out Chinese dinner added 
  to the clutter on the small table. She knew from experience that 
  nothing worked better to soothe her shattered nerves than a 
  little out of control, self- destructive eating binge.

  "I could kill that damned Maynard Hughes!" she thought. "I swear 
  to god if he ever lays a finger on me again I'm going straight 
  to Dr. Parsons!" Hughes was the reason for her present agitated 
  state of mind. He was the office "lech" -- a self-appointed 
  God's gift to women--and he was nothing if not persistent. Janis 
  was the present target of his unwelcome sexual advances, 
  probably because she was a new employee, still under six-month 
  probation, and Hughes was confident that she would be reluctant 
  to raise a fuss. Of course, it didn't hurt that he was married 
  to the former Estelle Parsons -- daughter of J. Harold Parsons 
  -- the founder of the Parsons Sensory Research Institute where 
  both Janis and Hughes worked.

  Actually, Hughes wasn't all that bad looking; she had even 
  accepted a ride home once, on a rainy day, before she knew what 
  he was like. In his car outside her apartment Hughes had proved 
  himself to be all hands and terribly hard of hearing. That had 
  happened over three months ago but it was as though the incident 
  had given him some kind of go-ahead signal or presented some 
  sort of irresistible challenge to his male ego because, since 
  that time, he had taken to grabbing the soft and sensitive parts 
  of her body whenever he could contrive to get her alone at work. 
  That was the other problem, Hughes was experienced and clever 
  enough to make his moves only when he could be certain that 
  there weren't any witnesses. Janis found it hard to believe that 
  a man could be so brash and bold and so insensitive to another 
  person's feelings. What an ass!

  Just thinking about it made her want another chocolate. She 
  looked the remains of the sampler over carefully before 
  selecting another of the little tidbits.

  Janis suppressed a shudder as the day's incident ran through her 
  mind for the hundredth time. She had innocently boarded the 
  elevator to head downstairs for afternoon coffee. Hughes had 
  cleverly dashed into the elevator just before the door closed. 
  As the elevator began moving he hit the emergency stop, which 
  stranded them -- alone -- and pushed her back into the corner. 
  She could still feel the weight of his body pressing her into 
  the corner and his rough, inept hands painfully mauling her 
  breasts. Janis pushed him away and covered her bosom with her 
  arms. That target no longer accessible, he redirected his 
  efforts to her shapely and unprotected backside, reaching behind 
  her to gather a generous pinch of the soft, yielding flesh. She 
  brought her knee up and slapped him as hard as she could. While 
  he was momentarily stunned, she cancelled the emergency stop and 
  pushed the button for the next floor. Janis stomped out of the 
  elevator, straightening her clothing, her face red with anger, 
  embarrassment and frustration. Her knee had missed its target -- 
  at least there had been some satisfaction in the slap, but it 
  wouldn't deter him, it would happen again, she knew that from 
  experience. "Well," she thought, "Just a few more weeks and I'm 
  off probation. Let's just see how that lecherous swine reacts to 
  the threat of a sexual harassment suit!"

  Gobbling down most of the little box of chocolates had had the 
  desired effect and she felt somewhat better about the incident. 
  At least she could think about it without shuddering. Janis 
  yawned and stretched, her arms extended outward and above her 
  head, and glanced at the clock. Time to turn in! Tomorrow was 
  Saturday and though it was normally a day off, she was going 
  back to the Institute to earn some extra money. The secretarial 
  job she had didn't pay well and, her paychecks, like almost 
  everyone else's, were never big enough. The only instructions 
  they had given her was to get a good night's sleep because they 
  wanted her rested and alert for the morning session.


  To her dismay, she had to share the elevator in the nearly empty 
  building that morning with none other than her nemesis, Maynard 
  Hughes. She wrapped her arms tightly around her bosom and backed 
  into the corner, ready to defend herself. Strangely, he didn't 
  made any kind of move at all. In fact, he barely seemed to 
  notice her. It was like he was preoccupied with something. But 
  the conspiratorial look on his face was most disturbing. She 
  breathed a sigh of relief when he got off on the second floor.

  She stopped outside the door of the appointed meeting place at 
  8:55 AM, five minutes early. The frosted glass window read:


                        Room 351 A

                     Gustatory Studies


  She was still a little flustered by her close brush with Hughes 
  on the elevator but at least, to her relief, he hadn't attacked 
  her again. Perhaps her penetrating glare had been sufficient to 
  keep him at bay. She shook it off, took a deep breath, opened 
  the door and went in.

  Hardly anyone in the busy room even looked up as she came in, 
  except for one person at the far end of the room. She recognized 
  the man immediately as he tucked his clipboard under his arm and 
  came over to greet her. His was the face in the painting in the 
  main lobby that gazed down at her sternly every time she entered 
  or left the building. It was the old man, none other than J. 
  Harold Parsons, M.D., Ph.D. himself, who was heading the team 
  that she had volunteered to be guinea pig for.

  "Good morning. You must be Ms. Tolbert," the distinguished, 
  silver-haired old researcher said jovially. "May I call you 
  Janis?" She nodded nervously, her hands clasped awkwardly 
  together. Sensing her nervousness, Parsons continued. "Did you 
  get a good night's rest?"

  Janis found her voice. "Yes, thank you Dr. Parsons," she managed 
  to stammer out.

  "Good, good!" he replied. "Well, we'd best get started. But 
  first, let me show you our equipment. Please come this way."

  He led her over to a large, complicated chair that was the 
  centerpiece of the room. She followed cautiously and looked it 
  over dubiously. What she saw did not inspire her confidence. It 
  looked like a kind of hyper-modern barber's (dentist's?) chair 
  -- one whose specifications had come straight out of a demented 
  electrician's nightmare. There were wires and cables running 
  helter-skelter from the base and down the back of the chair, 
  across the room and into a large glass-fronted booth which 
  covered the entire west wall of the room. Through the wide, 
  waist-to-ceiling window of the booth she could see a battery of 
  control consoles and computer monitors. There was definitely 
  some high-powered research going on, because each work station 
  was manned by a white-coated staff member and there were more 
  than twenty of them in the booth.

  At the top of the chair on a moveable arm was a small stainless 
  steel dome, about the size of a large mixing bowl. Its surface 
  was crawling with an even more complex snake's nest of wires 
  that were gathered into a fat, lumpy cable that ran down the 
  back of the chair and across the floor before it too disappeared 
  into the glass booth.

  "We're doing gustatory studies here in our laboratory, Janis -- 
  research into the human sense of taste. I think it's safe to say 
  that we have made some real breakthroughs in last few months. 
  Make no mistake, what we're doing here will surely revolutionize 
  the science of how and what people eat!" An assistant helped 
  Janis into a white plasticized coverall, gently sat her down in 
  the chair and buckled her in with a sort of webbed seat belt. 
  The chair felt fine, it was softly padded, and supported her in 
  just the right places. Janis was almost comfortable, except for 
  the hard little knot of fear simmering in the pit of her 
  stomach.

  "Please relax, Janis," soothed the old doctor. "This will be 
  totally painless. In fact, I think you'll find it to be quite 
  pleasurable." He carefully placed the metal mixing bowl device 
  over her brown shoulder-length hair -- it fit snugly -- and 
  after a few minor adjustments to position the fit, he secured it 
  with a velcro chin-strap. He then swivelled a small tray over in 
  front of her. The tray had a stack of wooden spatulas on it and 
  five small containers that looked just like her mother's 
  Tupperware. After looking the whole set-up over one more time, 
  he smiled, patted her on the shoulder, and went across the room 
  to enter the booth. Janis was alone with her thoughts for about 
  half a minute.

  "As I said earlier, we are going to do some tests on your sense 
  of taste, Janis." The voice, sudden and unexpected, startled 
  her. In a moment she realized that Parsons was speaking softly 
  into a microphone that was wired directly into a speaker in the 
  mixing bowl headset. "But first we need to calibrate our 
  equipment. Would you please take a small taste of the first 
  sample?" One of the containers on the tray had a large number 
  "1" scrawled in magic marker on its top. She removed the lid, 
  took one of the disposable wooden spatulas from the pile on the 
  left and, expecting the worst, carefully took a small taste.

  There was no electric shock, no thunder. It was salt, good old- 
  fashioned table salt. She felt the salty bite of it on the sides 
  and tip of her tongue.

  "Excellent, my dear!" came the soft voice from the helmet. 
  "You're coming through loud and clear." She couldn't move her 
  head but from what she could see, it looked as though Parsons 
  and the others were busy making adjustments to their equipment. 
  "Now rinse your mouth with some water from the squeeze bottle 
  and try sample number two.

  Number two was pure white sugar that dissolved immediately and 
  tickled at the tip of her tongue. She repeated the procedure for 
  samples three and four. Three was a dilute aqueous solution of 
  quinine, bitter on the back of her tongue and the roof of her 
  mouth. Janis had never developed a taste for gin and tonic and 
  the water rinse was most welcome. Number four was vinegar, wet 
  and sour, which nibbled sharply at the sides of her tongue. 
  Parsons and the others continued to make adjustments to their 
  consoles after each sample she tasted.

  His voice sounded soft and clear inside the headset.

  "Very good, Janis! You've just finished tasting samples of the 
  four major families of compounds, salty, sweet, bitter and sour, 
  that together make up the human sense of taste. At this stage, 
  our equipment can be considered to be roughly calibrated. 
  However, you probably know that the senses of smell and taste 
  are closely linked. Next we'll try some familiar foods to 
  determine how your individual patterns differ from our previous 
  subjects and to tune in that all- important olfactory 
  component."

  The pretty, young assistant brought in a different tray and took 
  the old one away. On it were a number of fruits and vegetables 
  and other everyday foods like bread and cheese. She tasted each 
  one in turn, all the while receiving encouragement from the 
  disembodied voice in the headset. Dr. Parsons made an 
  announcement after the second tray was removed.

  "Save this setup on drive B, Hamilton," she heard faintly. Then 
  more loudly: "We're ready to move on to phase two now, Janis." 
  The lights in the room dimmed. "Until now we have been measuring 
  the electrical signals from the receptor cells in your taste 
  buds to the corresponding areas of your brain's taste center. 
  Now were going to use our calibrations to electrically stimulate 
  your taste center. This will allow you to experience selected 
  tastes directly, without chewing or eating anything. Have 
  another water rinse, please." She nervously complied. The voice 
  came again, "Are you ready?"

  Janis gulped and said tersely, "Okay."

  There was a change in tone of the persistent electrical hum that 
  had pervaded the room all morning. Funny, she hadn't even 
  noticed it until it changed pitch. Very gently she felt a 
  sensation brush at the tip of her tongue. It started out faintly 
  and ended up sugary sweet. Next was sour, followed by bitter and 
  salty. Each was pure and perfect, only the gritty texture of the 
  powders was missing; the equipment could even mimic the 
  sensation of cool wetness that the liquid formulations 
  possessed. Janis smiled -- the sensation was definitely weird, 
  but really rather pleasurable, just like J. Harold Parsons had 
  told her at the beginning.

  "Excellent, Janis. Okay, now we're ready for phase three."

  There was another change in the intensity of the electrical hum 
  and Janis tasted the pure tart-sweet flavor of the orange she 
  had just enjoyed about a half hour before. It was the same... 
  only different. It was somehow amplified, better, this despite 
  the lack of any familiar texture on her tongue or in her mouth. 
  The apple was better, too, and she had never tasted such 
  flavorful bread. Janis was favorably impressed with the new 
  technique, to say the least!

  But they had saved the biggest surprise for last. Using 
  recordings from their previous subjects that had been subtly 
  modified by the computer programs to match Janis' electrical 
  patterns, she was able to experience foods that she hadn't 
  tasted earlier that day. And they had somehow chosen her 
  favorite.

  Chocolate!

  Chocolate -- smooth, almost intoxicating milk chocolate that 
  bathed her tongue and the roof of her mouth in creamy ecstasy. 
  This was the way chocolate was supposed to taste! Too soon, it 
  seemed, it was time for something else. She was terribly 
  disappointed when the wondrous sensation ended.

  But only for a moment.

  They followed it up with the rich, almost bitter taste of dark 
  semi-sweet chocolate. Perfect! Never had she tasted its like. It 
  was incredibly pleasurable, nearly orgasmic in its chocolate 
  intensity!

  But they still weren't done yet!

  While Janis was still in sensory shock from the tremendous 
  chocolateness of it all, they skillfully layered on a subtle mix 
  of flavors that had her absolutely reveling in a sort of 
  tenth-power chocolate-covered cherry!

  She almost cried when they shut off the power and the lights 
  came back on. The assistant came over and helped Dr. Parsons 
  disconnect her from the chair. She swiveled her head to and fro 
  and up and down to get the kinks out of her neck. To her acute 
  embarrassment, the upper front portion of her coverall was 
  soaking wet. Deep in the throes of her chocolate orgy, she had 
  apparently salivated all over it. Obviously they had been 
  thinking ahead by having her put on the coverall.

  Parsons held out a hand to help Janis up. She felt fine, outside 
  of being a little dizzy. The assistant helped her out of the 
  coverall and took it away. Red-faced, she wiped off her chin 
  with the towel that Parsons handed her.

  "That's one side effect that needs a little work," said the old 
  doctor lightly. "How do you feel, Janis?" She glanced at the 
  clock and was amazed to find that it was nearly noon. The 
  morning was over.

  "Uh...Okay, I guess," she said. "Wow, that last part of the 
  experiment, the bit with the chocolate, was incredible!"

  "Oh yes," he chuckled. "We like to add a bit of stimulation to 
  other selected areas of the brain during that phase. You might 
  call it 'a blast of chocolate straight to the pleasure center!' 
  You really liked it?"

  "Any time you need a subject, just give me a call," she replied. 
  They both laughed.

  Parsons' tone became a little more serious, "There are many 
  possible applications for this research. Of course, none of this 
  would be possible if we hadn't created machinery that can 
  directly stimulate the brain using a non-invasive technique. 
  With this technology many things become possible. A weight-loss 
  program would be a snap, because you could experience the 
  pleasure of any food you wanted while never eating a thing! Or 
  you could eat something mundane and have it taste like something 
  sublime. Imagine, for the cost of the electricity, you could eat 
  a cheap, tasteless, nutritious pap, while enjoying the 
  sensations of a gourmet meal! Or keep a library of the world's 
  greatest cuisine in the memory banks, to be experienced whenever 
  you have the desire or ..." He stopped, a little embarrassed. 
  "I'm sorry, Janis. I get kind of carried away when I start 
  talking about it.

  They made small talk for a few more minutes and shook hands 
  before they parted. She left the building with a spring in her 
  step, elated with the grand experience she'd just had, glad to 
  have most of a Saturday ahead of her and secure in the knowledge 
  that her next paycheck would be fifty dollars fatter. She went 
  out and did a little shopping and then spent the evening at the 
  movies with her best friend Gwen.


  After her Sunday morning workout, she decided to have the 
  remaining chocolates in her Whitman's sampler with a cup of 
  coffee. She carefully selected one of the remaining miniatures 
  in the yellow box and delicately took a small bite of it. Funny, 
  it had the right texture and feel but it didn't taste right at 
  all. The flavor was off, the tidbit tasted more like wax than it 
  did like chocolate. She washed it down with a gulp of coffee and 
  threw the rest of the piece away. "Stuff goes bad so quickly," 
  she thought, and reached for the one remaining piece, a 
  chocolate covered almond. The almond flavor came through just 
  fine, but again the chocolate tasted funny, like paraffin. She 
  sighed and finished her coffee and then got busy doing her 
  laundry and writing out checks to pay her monthly bills. She 
  thought no more about it for the rest of the day.

  In the evening she noticed that the chocolate mint she had after 
  dinner had the same sort of weird taste but it really was kind 
  of old. Wasn't it?

  She began to get worried when the Mr. Goodbar she bought out of 
  the vending machine on Monday morning to have with her coffee 
  break tasted the same. Alarmed, Janis offered half of it to one 
  of the other secretaries to see if she thought it tasted funny.

  "Mr. Goodbar," said the older woman. "One of my favorites."

  "Does it taste alright to you, Phyllis?"

  "You bet, nice and fresh. It's perfect. Thanks, Janis!"

  A few minutes later Janis was outside of room 351, trying to 
  calm herself down enough to knock, enter and explain her 
  problem. She screwed up her courage and rapped softly on the 
  door.

  Dr. Parsons answered the door and though she might have imagined 
  it, she thought he looked a little nervous himself when he saw 
  it was her.

  "What is it, my dear?" he asked. "You seem rather upset."

  "I'm sorry to bother you Dr. Parsons, but I'm afraid there's 
  something wrong," she said.

  "Wrong? What do you mean?"

  "It's chocolate," she said. "It doesn't taste right anymore. 
  I've tried several different kinds in the last two days, since 
  the experiments, and they all taste the same to me -- just like 
  wax."

  The old doctor nervously ran his fingers through his hair. 
  "Please sit down," he said solemnly. He took a deep breath and 
  let it out with a sigh. "I'm very sorry, Janis. I was afraid 
  that something like this might have happened. "You eat a lot of 
  chocolate, don't you?" Janis nodded. He continued. "Did you eat 
  a lot it just recently?" She nodded again. Parsons shook his 
  head. "That's what I thought. After you left I noticed that the 
  gain on the transmission unit was two clicks higher than it 
  should have been during the chocolate input test. The result is 
  a sort of fatigue of the nerves as a consequence of sensory 
  overload. We were lucky that it wasn't more intense. Hopefully 
  your condition will get better soon."

  "What do you mean by soon?" she asked, just managing to keep her 
  voice controlled.

  "Well," he replied. "Certainly less than a year, possibly only a 
  few months."

  "A year!" she cried. "This is terrible, chocolate is my favorite 
  food, my only vice, it helps me get by! What'll I do without 
  it?"

  "Now, now," he said, lamely. "It could be worse."

  "What if I decide to sue you?" she said as her resolve began to 
  crumble, knowing that the threat was hollow even as she made it.

  "You did sign a waiver, if you remember," he replied.

  It was obvious that Parsons had no idea how miserable life would 
  be for a lonely, single woman who couldn't enjoy a bit of 
  chocolate once in a while! Janis fell back on her last line of 
  defense. She began to cry softly.

  Parsons looked at her for a few moments, and his face softened. 
  Even after thirty years as a Psychologist, the old doctor was 
  still a sucker for the young woman's tears. He endured her 
  onslaught for only a few moments before getting up and putting 
  his arm around her shoulder. "There, there," he soothed, "let's 
  not argue. I think I have a solution that we can both live 
  with." She looked up at him hopefully. "You were such an 
  excellent test subject that I'd really like to continue working 
  with you -- to find out more about what went wrong, if nothing 
  else. If you really miss chocolate so terribly we can just hook 
  you up to the machine and take you for a ride. What do you say, 
  Janis? I'd like you to become an integral part of our research 
  team. The pay will, of course, be a lot better than your 
  secretarial job."

  Janis knew when she was being offered a good deal.

  "I accept," she said, wiping her eyes and sitting up straight. 
  "But make sure that those dials are on the right settings from 
  now on, okay?"

  "Just be thankful that you're not Maynard Hughes," said Parsons.

  Her ears perked up at the sound of the name. It occurred to her 
  that now was the perfect time to bring up that subject.

  "Hughes," she said. "I've been meaning to talk to you about him, 
  Dr Parsons. He's absolutely terrible, a real sex fiend, always 
  grabbing at me and the other girls in the hallways and in the 
  elevator. Something should be done about him."

  "I had been looking the other way because of my poor long- 
  suffering daughter," Parsons confessed. "That and I'm afraid 
  that his condition is partially my fault. Hughes volunteered to 
  be a subject on the McAllister sexual stimulator a couple of 
  months ago. Unfortunately, the results were not quite what we 
  expected.

  "Oh really," asked Janis, intrigued, "what happened?"

  "Because of his highly oversexed nature -- which I didn't know 
  about, by the way -- we had the power set five notches too high 
  when we hooked him up to the simulator. He suffered a numbing of 
  the senses just as you did. That old McAllister unit had one 
  more side effect that we've corrected on the new simulators: the 
  subject was afflicted with an overpowering and irrational urge 
  to satisfy his desires. That explains his awful manners. Maynard 
  would do or say almost anything get relief. Eventually he found 
  that he could only get satisfaction by hooking himself up to the 
  simulator. The poor fool began coming in after hours, boosting 
  the power ever higher with each visit. Hamilton finally caught 
  him one evening. We took away his key and gave him a stern 
  talking to. Unfortunately he must have had a duplicate because 
  he came in and hooked himself up again this weekend.

  "Hm, that must be where he was going when I saw him last 
  Saturday," said Janis, remembering her brief panic on the 
  elevator.

  "Probably. He set the machine on full power and I'm afraid that 
  he irreversibly overstimulated some of the nerve channels to his 
  brain. This time his condition is not reversible -- the power 
  was set too high. It's tragic. If only he'd had a little 
  self-control!"

  "Poor Maynard!" said Janis.

  "Yes," said Parsons. "Thank goodness we've licked the irrational 
  addiction problem on the new machines."

  "I'm glad to hear that, Dr. Parsons," said Janis, getting up. "I 
  really should get back to work now." She glanced at her watch. 
  "Actually, I have about ten minutes left." She thought for a 
  moment. "You don't suppose you could hook me up to that machine 
  right now, do you? I mean, just to see if it works. It would 
  only take a few minutes, wouldn't it? Please? You realize that I 
  haven't tasted any chocolate for two whole days now! Please, Dr, 
  Parsons, please?"

  The Sculptor  by Andrea Payne
===============================

  The marble was flawed. Anyone could see that. Though the 
  translucent block of pearl-white stone appeared whole and 
  lovely, moving into a different angle of light clearly revealed 
  the tiny webs and fractures that made it all but useless for 
  sculpture. The Sculptor eyed the marble with a critical and 
  irritable eye.

  "Perhaps Michelangelo could create from this damaged stone," he 
  thought, "as he created the timeless 'David', but I am not 
  Michelangelo!"

  He turned and walked around the block where it stood on his 
  artists' pedestal, again and again, taking in the sight of both 
  the glory and failing of the stone.

  "I cannot work with this," he sighed. He laid his hand upon it, 
  and felt the tingle of mystic power within the vibrant pillar -- 
  deep in his mind he felt fashioned the image of what lay hidden 
  within.

  The Sculptor stepped back to his worktable and took up the 
  narrow-bladed chisel and the small wooden mallet, the tools of 
  his artistry. Then returning to the marble he carefully placed 
  edge against the stone, lightly tapped it with the hammer, and 
  the first shaving of his creation slipped away like gossamer on 
  the wind...


  Caleb MacDhougal was impossible. He was intractable. He was 
  rude, and curt, and foul-mouthed. He was unapproachable, 
  solitary and unkind. Very few persons in the graduate program 
  for Art Therapy at Brakespear College held much hope for his 
  success in that field. Very few persons wanted anything to do 
  with him, because he was so all- around unpleasant. But in spite 
  of all the negative things he was, he had a way with whatever 
  medium he chose to work in, and the spark of genius could be 
  said to burn in him somewhere.

  "If only he weren't so damned secretive and arrogant and 
  unsociable!" said Lindy Walker as she walked with friends toward 
  Hillyer Hall, the site of the first of many practicum classes 
  for art therapy grad students. She spoke to her circle of 
  friends, gathered in the previous year of the program.

  "And strange," added Alex Burton. "Always wearing that hood and 
  cape and those tan leather gloves!" He pursed his lips. "I've 
  even seen him in the studios painting or drawing or whatever, 
  still wearing the hood and gloves. I think he's obsessed."

  "With what?" asked another of the group. She was a newcomer to 
  Brakespear, having transferred to the school to finish her 
  degree. Alex looked her up and down, as if to say "I don't know 
  you, so why should I answer your questions?"

  "Jyl-Ann Korotev," she ventured by way of introduction, and at a 
  slight nod by Lindy, Alex continued.

  "I think he views himself as some kind of eccentric artiste, 
  with his put-on airs. He won't make much of a therapist, though, 
  with whatever emotional baggage he carries along with him all 
  the time. That's why he's so rude, you know?"

  Conversation ceased as the group entered their classroom. It 
  ceased not because of their entering, but because the subject of 
  their discussion was already there, seated defensively with his 
  back to the far wall, facing the door. Jyl-Ann got her first 
  look at the much- discussed genius cum s.o.b.

  There wasn't a lot to see. Caleb MacDhougal wore a long, 
  midnight blue cape which sported a deep hood. This effectively 
  hid his face in deep shadows, even in the bright fluorescent 
  light of the classroom. All that could be seen was the slight 
  movement and angry sparkle of his eyes. His jeans poked out from 
  beneath the cloak, and the hint of a dark shirt could be seen in 
  the sleeves that were firmly overlapped by the ends of long, tan 
  leather gloves covering his hands.

  He studiously ignored the others after their entrance, and they 
  all took seats on the opposite side of the room from him.

  Jyl-Ann was intrigued. Caleb radiated quite clearly that he 
  wished to be left alone in whatever private hell he was in. 
  Jyl-Ann couldn't imagine what could tear a person up so... or 
  she could, but having dealt with her own darkness with the help 
  of a loving husband and a committed priest-counselor, she 
  sometimes lost sight of the pain and anger that could twist and 
  gnaw and destroy a person's self- respect and self-love.

  Rather than join the others in their rejection of Caleb, Jyl-Ann 
  walked over to the seat next to his and asked, "Is this seat 
  taken?"

  The hooded head jerked up and bright blue eyes turned to glare 
  up at her... she sensed the utter rage trembling beneath the 
  eccentric clothing. Nothing was said for a moment, then he 
  croaked hoarsely, "No, sit wherever the hell you like," and 
  returned to contemplation of the sketchbook he was holding.

  Jyl-Ann cautiously stole a glance at the image of charcoal tiger 
  lillies and cornflowers on the paper. It was elegant, and she 
  said so. Caleb snorted in disgust, whisking the sketchbook 
  closed and slamming his books upon it with a finality that 
  reverberated across the room. Gingerly she took the seat next to 
  him, surreptitiously finding Lindy's gaze, hoping for support, 
  but finding nothing but tense astonishment there and in the eyes 
  of the rest of the class. It was with relief that she realized 
  Mark Kaiser had entered the room and begun taking role call.

  When finished, Mr. Kaiser turned to Jyl-Ann with a reassuring 
  smile. "Ah, yes. A fine new face in our midst. Would you like to 
  take the floor and tell the class something about yourself?"

  "Sure. I've been interested in art therapy since I was a senior 
  in high school. I took one of those general interest computer 
  tests and realized art therapy was the perfect combination of my 
  love for the visual arts and what I believe to be a gift for 
  helping people. I don't want that to sound conceited, but I have 
  been told over my lifetime that I'm sensitive -- sometimes 
  overly so -- to the hurt felt by others, and have wanted to 
  alleviate that hurt as best I could whenever possible. I've been 
  working toward this degree on and off now for over seven years, 
  and am very glad to settle down and finish it here at 
  Brakespear."

  "Well, good. We're glad to have you here. Now for an icebreaker 
  to get everyone loosened up for the year ahead. Think of an 
  object or group of objects that symbolizes what you would like 
  to accomplish this year. Using any media you have available, 
  depict that object or objects, and then partner up with one or 
  two people and tell them about your goals."

  Jyl-Ann watched Caleb while arranging her materials. He sat 
  still, but for twirling a silver pen, staring into space. She 
  settled to work, mentally sighing and asking for prayerful 
  guidance. Her gentle scrolls were abruptly interrupted by a 
  series of low growls from Caleb and the scrape of rough strokes 
  of charcoal meeting paper. Then silence.

  She shifted her weight to lean closer to the dark form next to 
  her and cleared her throat expectantly. "Caleb." A nudging. 
  Soft. He began twirling the pen again. Before him on the page 
  lay a stark, reflective hunting knife glistening with fresh 
  blood. He said no word.

  "Caleb." She brushed his shoulder with her hand. He started 
  violently and leaned back away from her to stare viciously. "My 
  friends call me Jyl. Um, my goals are depicted here" she moved 
  the pastel scrollwork of vines and leaves around a glowing cross 
  closer to Caleb's workspace "by the obnoxious growth of these 
  flowers... I hope not only to be taught how to be an art 
  therapist, but also to be my own client, working with others and 
  God to better understand me and my inner soul."

  Caleb stared at her with clenched jaw until she squirmed 
  uneasily, then slowly turned to his own drawing, tapping a slow 
  beat on the blade of the knife with the pen at each uttered 
  word. "Revulsion. Fear. Mutilation. Death."

  After class Lindy caught stride with Jyl, popping with 
  questions. "What do you think of Caleb, Jyl? How could you stand 
  to sit next to him? Did he say anything to you? Haven't you 
  heard the stories about him? Did you get a look at his face?" At 
  this last Lindy put on a contorted expression.

  Raising an eyebrow in question Jyl replied cautiously, "Alex was 
  right about Caleb having a lot of baggage."

  "His face and hands are withered and welted with ghastly scars! 
  Jason told me during class that he caught a glimpse of them when 
  Caleb was rinsing his face in the men's room during that heat 
  wave last summer. Caleb tried to get him to keep quiet about it, 
  but Jason's a born blabbermouth."

  And you're certainly not helping matters, thought Jyl, looking 
  around guiltily at the throng of people they'd entered near the 
  Towers snack grill.

  "And Alex says he heard that Caleb got those scars from 
  attacking a woman with a knife and trying to rape her--but she 
  got a hold of the knife herself and cut him up!"

  "Knife?" Jyl gulped as she remembered Caleb's chilling drawing 
  in class.

  "But Sherry says he was caught in a horrible house fire while 
  babysitting two boys."

  "Did they survive?" Her voice held a note of sarcasm as she 
  recovered from her personal panic at the rape story. All of this 
  was probably an active textbook case of rampant rumor.

  "No. Personally, I think he murdered them and hid them in the 
  basement."

  "Lindy, that's ridiculous."

  She quickly put a finger to her lips as a threateningly cloaked 
  figure stepped in line two or three people behind them.

  "Do you think he heard us?" rasped Lindy in an ill-disguised 
  stage whisper.

  Eyes flashing warning, Jyl shook her head curtly and said, "Even 
  if he didn't, which isn't likely, most of the students in our 
  class are probably wondering about him, and I'll bet your talk 
  has piqued interest in our present company, too. Has anyone 
  actually asked Caleb why he wears his cloak?"

  "Are you out of your fucking mind?! I won't go anywhere near 
  him!"

  "Uh-huh. Which means you've compounded his isolation. Now 
  instead of simply an obsessive oddity you've created grotesque 
  reasons to be both ridiculing and curious of him.

  "I want to be your friend, Lindy. And Alex's, and Jason's, and 
  Caleb's, and everyone else's friend. If not close, then politely 
  amiable. I doubt Caleb trusts anyone. But believe me, I want to 
  change that. After all of this spewage gets around, whether or 
  not it is true, Caleb will be doubly hellish, I'm sure. If you 
  have curiosity to cure, confront him yourself. I want no part in 
  your cruelty."

  Jyl turned away from Lindy's shocked open-mouthed "O" with sick 
  grumblings in her stomach...but not before they both sensed and 
  saw Caleb gazing steadily at them.

  It was with a great shuffling that the girls gathered their food 
  and moved into the room. Jyl stopped and looked apologetically 
  at Lindy. "I'm sorry. He scares me, too. But I'm determined not 
  to let my fear keep me from trying to get to know him better. 
  I'll see you later. I'd like to be by myself for awhile." Jyl 
  moved away slowly and took a seat in an almost-deserted alcove 
  and picked dejectedly at her salad, her appetite long gone. 
  Brooding, she glanced up to see stark blue eyes gazing at her 
  from the depths of a hood not more than two table lengths away.


  The form was there. A basic, rough-hewn shape almost clawed from 
  the stone by the chisel laying inert now in The Sculptor's 
  slick- sweated hand. A precarious balance was held in this 
  block. He traced the dark flaws with his fingertips, straining 
  in his mind to see how he might integrate this ugliness into the 
  frozen beauty he wished to create. A misplaced tap, a too-eager 
  breaking out of the form toward the details he saw deep within 
  the rock could end in absolute, shattered chaos. It was a 
  precarious balance indeed.


  Jyl stared at her salad for a long moment, stabbing at it with a 
  trapped vengeance while under Caleb's scrutiny. Why does he 
  watch me so? "...trying to rape her..." It's only a vicious 
  rumor... right? She pushed her bowl away in contempt. How could 
  she allow herself to fall into that talk trap...even 
  momentarily? She set her chin in the cup of her hands, fading 
  into thought.

  So what's wrong with admitting I'm afraid? He does cut a 
  menacing figure, even if I don't know the true reason why. How 
  would he react to such honesty? Is he afraid of nothing? The 
  memory of his staccato croaks, "Repulsion. Fear. Mutilation. 
  Death." echoed in her mind, causing her to narrow her eyes and 
  lean into her hands to attempt to read the suddenly guarded 
  sparkle staring back. Or does he soak up all fear and hatred and 
  shock encountered from others to reflect it out again in a front 
  of omnipotence? If it's only a front...

  But even if it is a front, I still can't bring myself to ply 
  excuses for Lindy's "revelation" about him. Surely he heard. And 
  I doubt he's a fool.

  The best I can do is try to find the good in him and focus on 
  it.

  What if, inside, hidden beneath the shield of dark shadows and 
  wicked silence there is a man repulsed, afraid, and lividly 
  hateful of himself?

  Then I can only accept him as he is, reach for the good, and 
  continue to be honest. Perhaps he may come to trust me.

  At this she walked over to him and waved meekly. "You've 
  frightened me, watching me this afternoon. What do you find so 
  fascinating about me?"

  Caleb snorted, retorting, "You're afraid. Good."

  Jyl felt a shiver of dread pale her face ashen. "They're only 
  rumors!" she screamed to herself.

  "As to fascination, I could ask the same of you." He rose then, 
  towering above her in a swirl of cloth and scent of soap, and 
  stalked from the hall, whipping his dishes on the conveyer belt 
  with a clatter.

  Over the next few weeks, Jyl gently and persistently greeted 
  Caleb every day in their classes with a soft "Good morning" or 
  "Hello". Tense and silent, he turned his back on everyone while 
  working, jealous in his protection of his project plans before 
  completion. Jyl never intruded, but she let her presence be felt 
  by tentative verbal nudgings when the frustration of artistic 
  failure loomed too closely.

  One morning, Jyl came to class early to gain some quiet time for 
  finishing a project, and Caleb's entrance was felt more than 
  actually seen. Her greeting to him was subdued and preoccupied. 
  He settled with a huff, then grumped a low "Hi" in her 
  direction. Jyl froze for a fraction of a second, her eyes grown 
  wide at the gutteral sound. Her smile of pleasure was evident 
  despite her attempt to control it.


  Another sliver fell away. With an exasperated expulsion of air, 
  The Sculptor pushed away from the table and stood to stretch. 
  The faint hint of a leaf. But that damn flaw held him in check. 
  He was tempted to crack it with one deft blow...but that would 
  shatter the grace he'd been coaxing from the stone. Little 
  pieces of marble, some no longer than his thumbnail, littered 
  the floor. This was the only way.


  To Jyl's dismay, her classmates did not share her desire to 
  befriend Caleb. Most simply ignored him. One or two bordered on 
  the obnoxious with references to the "Phantom of the Opera" and 
  "the Shadow knows". And of course there were the rumors. The 
  frequency of halted conversations at her entry and Caleb's 
  increased gruffness caused her to be afraid.

  Did Caleb even notice the energy she used to protect him from 
  Jason and Alex's incessant teasing and spying? She tried to 
  pierce his menace by being present for him, tried to remain 
  vulnerable and accepting to ease him into a friendship with her. 
  She shuddered with the realization that he could heartlessly 
  rend what threads of watchfulness and privacy she'd already 
  drawn with only a few curt words or actions. He was cold, 
  arrogant, and sealed in a shroud of crushing bitterness. Was she 
  really up against the monster Lindy hinted lurked in that hood? 
  One who did not want her protection nor her attentiveness no 
  matter how subtle she was? This possibility had not occurred to 
  her before. And it hurt like hell.

  Maybe she could work out some of her anxiety in the ceramics 
  studio. Clay didn't move as freely as a pencil and paper, but 
  she did find it was safer to punch around than most other solid 
  objects, like apartment walls.

  Anxious and pensive on entering the room, she found a little 
  relief in that there were only a few people present, but not so 
  much that Caleb was one of them. Her greeting to him was barely 
  a whisper. He shifted his weight uncomfortably, gave her a 
  shallow wave, then returned his attention to the potter's wheel 
  he contemplated. She quietly stepped up beside him and studied 
  the cylinder of clay with him. "What will it be, Caleb?"

  "A study in clay netting. Coiled lace on the outer walls."

  "You must have very deft fingers for detail work like that, 
  Caleb. I'm sure it'll be gorgeous." Jyl turned to slice off a 
  chunk of clay from the storage supply, and began kneading it and 
  mashing it just for its energy absorbing properties. Caleb fired 
  up the wheel and began weaving the shining coils around his 
  vessel. As the pattern grew, Caleb half stood in his 
  concentration. Out of the corner of her eye Jyl saw Christy 
  lugging a five-gallon bucket of glaze behind Caleb, trying to 
  get through a space too narrow. With a clunk and a splash the 
  bucket hit Caleb in the back of the knees, throwing him forward.

  The sound of Caleb's work collapsing beneath his body seemed 
  loud in the sudden silence of the room. For a moment, everything 
  seemed frozen in a tableau. Then Caleb was straightening up, 
  whirling on Christy who backed down the aisle between two 
  worktables, terrified at the angry fire in his eyes. Caleb's arm 
  was an accusing lance pointing at her as he hissed, "You 
  clumsy... stupid... fucking FOOL ! DAMN you!"

  Jyl covered the distance in two strides, yanking on Caleb's 
  shoulder in urgent determination. "Caleb! Caleb, stop it! Look 
  at me!" Jyl stepped between Caleb and his quarry, 
  near-desperation in her eyes. She took his hands in hers, 
  encased though they were in clay-mucked plastic and leather 
  gloves, and peered into the deep hood.

  She would have recoiled at the danger she saw there, but 
  suddenly the pressure of control between them was not hers. 
  "Caleb?" she whispered, fighting down the apprehension as she 
  stared at the shadowy fissures and weathered parchment that were 
  the left side of his face.

  "I have been working for two months on this piece, and she 
  doesn't even have the grace to say 'excuse me'? I could have 
  moved aside, you know." Christy's inane babbling apologies 
  caused Caleb to turn on her, still gripping Jyl's hands. "You're 
  careless. You're an idiot. Why didn't you just ask me to move? I 
  don't know how you ever got into this program. You've destroyed 
  two months of my work!"

  Jyl tugged on his hands, drawing his attention back to her. 
  "Caleb, was this a project for one of your classes?" she asked.

  "Hell, no," he said bitterly. "I was just doing this for... 
  for... me. Just because I like ceramics... and sculpture... just 
  because..." His anger was lessening. His grip on her hands 
  weakened. And finally, his lips pursed tightly in a thin pale 
  line, he brusquely pulled his hands from Jyl's. He turned to the 
  wheel, swept the crushed fragments of his creation to the floor, 
  and strode coldly from the room without a backward glance.

  Jyl didn't know if she should give chase or remain still. But 
  she probably should breathe again. With a whoosh she let the 
  tension of the last few minutes go, and sucked air into her 
  lungs once more. Christy was crying. "He's not a monster, you 
  know." Jyl looked at her defiantly, threw her poundings and 
  Caleb's fragments into the scrap barrel, and left.

  A quick stop at the front desk confirmed Caleb's apartment being 
  a floor up from Jyl's. She climbed the stairs, and soon found 
  herself poised to knock on his door. But the muffled sounds of 
  metal against stone stopped her. Working again. Didn't his ideas 
  ever stop? Didn't he ever get blocked? Didn't he ever get tired? 
  Jyl smiled, shook her head. He's okay. And she snuck back to her 
  rooms as quietly as she'd come.

  Jyl remembered she still had to mount three drawings for the 
  critique tomorrow. It was actually a finalist judging done by 
  the art professors for the Brakespear Student Art Show. They 
  would choose no more than five entries from each class. Hope and 
  competition was high in the studios this time of year.

  Jyl hoped Jason wouldn't throw a fit about Christy. They'd been 
  going together for two years, and he was almost fanatic about 
  his protection of her from Caleb. Nothing had happened. Jyl had 
  seen to that. But events like that always managed to blow out of 
  proportion. She sighed and settled to work. Only morning would 
  give the answers.

  When Jyl entered the gallery the next day where the judging was 
  to take place, Jason and Caleb were already having an argument. 
  Or rather, Christy was standing off to the side with a smug look 
  on her face talking to Lindy while Jason yelled at Caleb. Said 
  midnight tower stood his ground in silent contempt.

  "One of these days, Mr. MacDhougal, you'll go too far. Then 
  you'll be sorry you ever haunted the Brakespear campus." Jason 
  never addressed Caleb by his first name. The formality lent more 
  non- humanity to his attacks.

  "Don't threaten him, Jason." Jyl walked over.

  "Oh, so now you've got a guardian angel, Mr. MacDhougal. Is she 
  acting as your tongue today?"

  "No." One word.

  "Let it be, Jason. Caleb didn't hurt Christy physically, and he 
  was rightfully angry. Caleb lost a piece of artwork. Christy 
  lost a little courage. It's over."

  "That's what you think." Jason crossed the hall grumbling.

  Jyl didn't like the look of things. She shot a side-long glance 
  at Caleb. He met her gaze. "While the profs are puttering 
  around, how would you like to do a tandem critique of our own 
  work?" she asked.

  "You want to know what I think of your work?"

  "And I'd like to see what other ingenious ideas you've tried and 
  been successful with. That vase was fantastic."

  "Yeah." Gruff. "Well, come here then."

  Their voices were low as the judges started their rounds. Jyl 
  was careful to praise and encourage, and to ask Caleb before 
  handling any of his pieces. They were all sculptured in some 
  form.

  "How do you do that, Caleb?" Jyl remarked on a three-foot-high 
  marble carving of a gnome. "It's stone, for God's sake. How do 
  you get a creature like that out of stone?"

  "You've seen my woodcarving, right? It's like that only the 
  surface is much harder." Caleb moved in front of Jyl's 
  softsculpture train. "I think your embroidery balances the cab 
  and cars well. You're talented in sculpture and details too, 
  Jyl." Jyl blushed under the fond warmth in his eyes.

  They sat on a bench to critique other students' work for the 
  rest of the afternoon. And immersed as they were in their world 
  of color and symbolism, they both started when Jason exploded in 
  fury at the judges' announcements of the show entries.

  "I should have been in this show. Not YOU!" He pointed a vicious 
  finger at Caleb. "What did you do to weasel your way into this 
  thing, you son-of-a-bitch?"

  "He didn't do anything other than produce work better than 
  yours, Jason." Jyl looked from Caleb's gold -starred gnome to 
  Caleb with a smile.

  Jason turned on Jyl with disgust. "And you!" Jyl's head snapped 
  up in surprise. "What the hell do you get out of being near him? 
  A good fuck? Is he "loveable and capable"? Do you "ease his 
  pain" with sexual favors? You're a goddamn fucking SLUT!"

  Jyl sputtered and shook at the absurd cruelty of Jason's words. 
  She suddenly felt very small. Choking back a sob, she ran from 
  the room to escape the eyes that stared at her.

  Caleb rose slowly from his seat, and glared at Jason squarely in 
  the eye, measuring him. "I usually let shit run off me like 
  water off the back of a duck. But not when it involves my 
  friends." He hauled back and hit Jason in the stomach, doubling 
  him over. Caleb looked at him dispassionately and then stalked 
  from the hall.


  The Sculptor had been working for hours. Paper was strewn over 
  the table and floor in utter disarray, sketches of the form 
  before him. Maybe it would work. Why hadn't he thought of it 
  before? Could he actually make the flaw a fair part of the 
  statue?

  Two.
------

  The next day, Caleb's chair in class was empty. Jyl tapped her 
  pencil on the table. He'd never missed a class. She looked 
  furtively at Jason and Christy. The former was stonefaced. She 
  traced circles over her paper with her fingertips, made some 
  weak scribbles. She frowned. Was he sick? Had something happened 
  to him? She made a face at her work and threw it away.

  Afterwards, Lindy came up to her with awe in her eyes. "You 
  should have seen what Caleb did to Jason after you left!"

  Jyl's stomach took a flip. "What did Caleb do after I left?"

  Lindy put her arm on Jyl's shoulder confidentially and said, "He 
  rumbled something about crap not affecting him unless it had to 
  do with his friends, and then he slugged Jason in the gut!"

  Jyl's eyes were wide with concern."What did Jason do then?"

  "He just doubled over moaning, and Caleb walked out of the 
  room."

  Jyl looked around, hoping to see the familiar dark shadow, but 
  he wasn't there. So why hadn't Caleb been in class?

  She practically ran to Caleb's apartment, surprised to find no 
  answer to her knock, and the door unlocked.

  But more astonishing was the fragile marble cluster of flowers 
  on the table. Polished and glowing, it sat in elegant splendor 
  among a sheaf of scattered sketches, which showed various views 
  of a deep flaw in the stone. Jyl traced the delicate form with 
  her fingertips, then remembered why she'd come.

  "Caleb?" She walked to the living room. No one. She walked down 
  the back hall, and knocked softly at his bedroom. No answer. She 
  peeked in. He lay sprawled on his bed in peaceful slumber, bare 
  to the waist. His scars extended down his arms and chest, 
  slightly warping the muscles in streaks of white and faded 
  brown. Embarrassed to find him so vulnerable, she approached 
  slowly, and drew the cover over him to his neck. Her touch 
  awakened him.

  He pulled back somewhat, his eyes shifting between question and 
  guarded uncertainty. "What are you doing here?"

  Jyl's embarrassment increased. "You...you weren't in class this 
  morning. I...I was worried about you. So I came up here to check 
  on you."

  "Oh." He burrowed deeper in the blanket, gazing at her 
  uncomfortably. "Why were you worried about me? Why bother?"

  Jyl smiled and gently touched his scarred cheek. He started to 
  pull away, grimaced, then allowed himself to come back against 
  her hand. "Caleb, you're my friend." She squeezed his shoulder, 
  then rocked back up on her feet. "C'mon. Get up. I'll go in the 
  other room so you can get dressed."

  "Jyl."

  "Hmm?"

  "Thanks."

  She walked out in the hall, then called back, "Those flowers on 
  the table are gorgeous."

  "Oh that. I've been working on that for a long time. The biggest 
  bitch was trying to work around the flaw."

  "How did you do it?"

  "I realized I had to work with the flaw, and not against it. I 
  think the whole thing is stronger now."

  "Like Michelangelo's 'David'?"

  "Yeah, right."

  They were silent for a few moments, then Jyl scuffed her toe on 
  the carpet and asked, "Why didn't you go to class today?"

  A long pause, then a sigh. "I had some thinking to do."

  "About?"

  "My scars."

  Jyl nodded to herself, stroking the scars on her arm, 
  remembering the hopelessness and pain in a young girl's mind so 
  many years ago. "Do you want to talk about it?" She moved to the 
  living room as Caleb emerged in jeans and a green short-sleeved 
  shirt.

  He stood running his fingers through his hair, watching her. 
  Abruptly, he turned to trail his hand along the edge of the 
  table. "I've been working on this all semester, you know." He 
  grazed the petal edges of the statue with his fingertips. "Do 
  you recognize it?"

  Jyl moved to stand opposite him. "No...you've never done... wait 
  a minute! Cornflowers and tiger lillies!" She locked her gaze 
  with his in confirmation. "It's from that drawing I saw the 
  first day of class, right?"

  She crouched down at eye level with the piece to scrutinize it 
  more closely. Then she turned and said softly, "Does this tie in 
  somehow with what's bothering you?"

  "Yeah." He ran his fingers through his hair again, not looking 
  at her.

  "Caleb." She rose, taking one of his hands in hers, gazing at 
  him plainly. "I'm your friend. Talk to me."

  He pulled away and strode to the window. For some time he simply 
  stood gazing out at the lawn. "When I was in third grade my art 
  class took a field trip to a glassblower's shop," he spat 
  through his teeth.

  "A field trip."

  "Yeah." His face took on a pained expression, his knuckles white 
  on the sash of the window."Some of the finished pieces sat on a 
  shelf, cooling. They glowed. I thought there was some kind of 
  magic inside." Then he turned and slowly sat down on the couch. 
  "Why the hell am I telling you this? You don't need to know 
  this! I feel like it's being pulled from me one fucking word at 
  a time."

  Jyl wondered if he'd ever fully trust her. Her voice was very 
  quiet as she spoke. "What do you think I'm going to do to you if 
  you keep talking, Caleb?"

  "I don't know. Go away."

  "That's right. You don't know. And I'm not going away, either. 
  That's what everyone else has done, isn't it? Talk to me."

  Caleb turned to stare at her. The light in his eyes was hard. 
  "What do you know about what others have done? Except run away 
  from me as fast as they could because they were terrified at 
  what they saw?"

  "Caleb, I didn't run away from you. And I don't blame you for 
  your being scarred. Did you ever think that the others ran away 
  from you not because of what they saw, because you've always 
  worn your cape, but because of what they've felt from you? When 
  I approached you that first day of classes, I could almost 
  tangibly grasp your anger."

  "Of course I know that!" he exploded. "I drove them away! That 
  fucking cape is my protection against this whole shit-filled 
  world!" His voice caught and he covered it over with a cough. 
  "But hiding doesn't work anymore." he added softly.

  He sat there for a minute or two, clenching and unclenching his 
  fists. Then he laughed without mirth, saying, "When no one was 
  looking, I put my hands around one of those fucking vases." He 
  mocked childlike wonder and the fateful action. "The shock sent 
  me into convulsions, and the glass spread and splattered over my 
  body like the Blob." He rubbed at his arms and hands as though 
  to scrub the scars off, then wiped his hands on his thighs. He 
  looked reluctantly at Jyl. "The damage was already done by the 
  time the teachers could get there to help me."

  Jyl sat still for a long time, letting his words sink in, trying 
  to send acceptance to him. She slowly held out her hand. "Magic 
  is a great thing, you know. And I think there's still a spark of 
  it inside you, because you've managed to become a successful 
  artist despite the pain you experienced."

  He glanced at her then, and back to his open, welted palms. 
  "Yeah. Pain. It's interesting, isn't it, that I'm a sculptor 
  now, and that I work with cold things... clay and marble and the 
  like." Uncertainty still lingered in his voice.

  "Jyl." He gingerly placed his hand in hers. "I realized 
  yesterday that I've never let the bitterness go." His grip 
  tightened. "For all these years I've clung to the rumors, to the 
  teasing and the cruelty and the ugliness, and let them devour me 
  into a shadow." He took a shaky breath, looked at her squarely. 
  "I've never stood up for me as a man. I...I've always lived as 
  the monster everyone's said I am. I've had to come to terms with 
  that."

  Jyl smiled at him, stroking the back of his hand with her thumb. 
  "You've taken some large steps toward that goal right here, 
  Caleb."

  "I know. But I think I've still got a long way to go. I've only 
  begun to break my own shell." He paused, thoughtful. "I realized 
  something else, too."

  "What's that?"

  "Being present and listening to a person is 95 percent of being 
  a therapist. Not jabbering advice." He looked at her with a 
  spark of hope in his eyes. "Thanks for being here, Jyl."

  "That's what friends are for."

  They sat that way, in comfortable rapport, for the better part 
  of half an hour. Then they stood, and Jyl moved to give Caleb 
  the hooded cloak hanging by the door. But he stopped her with a 
  wave of a disfigured hand.

  "No, I don't need that anymore."

  Mister Wilt  by Jason Snell
=============================

  I was so tired that I couldn't keep my eyes open. It was eight 
  in the morning and I was sitting, hair still wet from my early 
  morning shower, on a cold wooden pew in church. It had taken me 
  until 2 a.m. to get the skinny, squinty-eyed girl I had invited 
  over "to watch television" into bed with me, and it took me over 
  two hours to get her out of the house once we were finished. I 
  had managed to get three hours of sleep that night, and I didn't 
  feel very cheery.

  I was tired, I didn't like the feeling of my wet hair, and 
  church is not my favorite place in the whole world. My mother 
  and father were sitting on my right, and my little sister was in 
  my mom's lap. Andi was asleep -- mom is a more comfortable 
  backrest than these horrible Methodist pews.

  When we moved to Clarkesburg, I figured that my life would be 
  pretty much like it had always been. But instead, my parents had 
  decided to transform their lives into something straight out of 
  the fifties. That was appropriate for my new hometown of 
  Clarkesburg, Pennsylvania, which was also straight out of the 
  fifties. Maybe even the eighteen-fifties. The whole town was 
  either Baptist or Methodist. Half the town was sitting on the 
  same hard pews that I sat on.

  A little man with a wrinkled face sat on my left, evidently 
  unconcerned about the time of day and the pain caused by those 
  awful pews. Old Wrinkly was wearing a plaid shirt and a bow tie, 
  and sat with his hands folded together in what I assumed was a 
  praying position. A good supposition, I think, considering that 
  we were in church.

  I assume he saw me staring at him, because his tiny eyes popped 
  open and he turned to look at me.

  "What's your name, boy?" he whispered to me.

  I straightened up and looked straight ahead at the minister.

  "Jim," I said out of the corner of my mouth.

  "Talk to you after the sermon," the man said.

  A wrinkly old Methodist wanted to talk to me after the boring 
  service. It was just what I wanted to hear. At that moment, 
  there was no place that I would have rather been than back home 
  in bed -- except maybe back in California. No such luck.

  After the service, my parents and I stood outside of the church. 
  Before we could move toward our car, the wrinkly old man 
  sauntered up and began talking to us.

  "Hello there," he said to my father, and held out his hand. 
  "Name's Mr. Wilt. Pleased to meet you."

  My father shook Wilt's hand and smiled. Yeah, my dad had fallen 
  for this down-home Pennsylvania bullshit. He loved the hard 
  pews, the boring church services (we're from California, for 
  pete's sake -- we're not supposed to go to church!), and 
  especially the crazy people who lived in this town. Wilt was 
  just another nutty old Methodist. I was sure of it.

  "I was talking to your boy in church earlier," Wilt said, and 
  pointed at me. "I don't recognize you folks. Guess you're new to 
  Clarkesburg, aren't you?"

  "Yes, we are," my father said.

  "Wonder if you might like to come over to my place for Sunday 
  brunch? My wife, she's a Baptist, but she's still one hell of a 
  cook." He chuckled at his joke. I didn't. "Seeing as though 
  you're new here, I thought it would be hospitable of me to 
  invite you all over."

  My father's face lit up. Of course, nobody was this nice in 
  California, but dad didn't have to actually accept the guy's 
  offer. "Thanks for asking, have a nice day" would be acceptable 
  enough, right?

  Wrong. Like I said, my dad is completely enchanted with the 
  "quaint old-fashioned charm" of the people of Clarkesburg. He 
  accepted Wilt's offer.

  Any hope of my getting back to sleep was gone. I could only pray 
  (it was Sunday, so why not pray?) that Mrs. Wilt's food was 
  edible.


  Wilt's joke was right -- even though she was a Baptist, Erma 
  Wilt made a wonderful breakfast. The tiny gray-haired woman 
  cooked and served us bacon, eggs, pancakes, and orange juice all 
  by herself, and managed to keep a smile the entire time. It 
  didn't taste that bad, and just the fact that we were being 
  served authentic Pennsylvanian hospitality cuisine made my 
  father very happy.

  I really wanted to be home in bed, asleep, or at least propped 
  up and watching a football game or something. Then I remembered: 
  football doesn't start until one in the afternoon out here. What 
  kind of place was this?

  "So," Mr. Wilt asked as we finished our brunch, "how did you 
  folks end up here in Clarkesburg?"

  "Well, I got tired of the hectic lifestyle in Los Angeles, and 
  decided that my family and I needed a change. My parents grew up 
  just few miles down the road, in Bucks County, and so I figured 
  we'd come back here."

  My father is a writer. He bought a computer and a modem, and 
  suddenly living in a big city near his agent became pointless. 
  Using new technology is all well and good, but dad didn't have 
  to move us all to an area with nothing but bearded men driving 
  wagons, old Civil War battle sites, and wrinkly Methodists.

  "It's so nice here," my mother said, and smiled. She had bought 
  into dad's fantasy. She was entranced by the Wilts' 
  old-fashioned charm.

  I, however, felt extremely ill.

  "Can I go outside, mom? I need some air." I didn't need to hear 
  my parents rave about the virtues of eastern Pennsylvanian life 
  again.

  "Jamie, that's very--"

  Mr. Wilt cut her off in mid-sentence.

  "Sounds like a good idea," he said. "Let's go get some air, 
  boy."

  Wilt led me outside into his backyard, and showed me an old 
  wooden shed, overrun by moss.

  "This shed was my workshop years ago," he said. "Back then, I 
  wasn't a God-fearing man. I just did my work and figured that 
  everything else would take care of itself."

  Then Wilt's eyes opened wide, he turned around to see if anyone 
  was nearby, and began to speak in a whisper.

  "Turns out, I have to be a God-fearing man. If there aren't 
  enough God-fearing men, then Satan wins."

  Maybe Pennsylvanians weren't as dull as I had thought.

  "Satan's out there, boy, and he's working against all of us. 
  Doesn't matter if you're a Methodist or a Baptist or a hedonist 
  or anything. He's still out to get us. You've got to fear God if 
  you're going to survive. Understand, Jim?"

  I nodded. I figured that if I said the wrong thing, he might try 
  to exorcise me.

  "Fearing God's not enough, though. You've got to know the 
  secret. My wife, she's a Baptist. She can't know the secret. 
  Your parents, they're from California. They can't know the 
  secret. Your sister, she's too young. She can't understand the 
  secret. But you, Jim-boy, you can understand. It's not too late 
  for you."

  He was speaking quickly, but his voice was so soft that I could 
  barely hear what he was saying. Still, it was hard to miss his 
  general point.

  "This is the secret, Jim. Don't tell anyone unless they can be 
  trusted. They've got to pass the test! You understand?"

  I nodded again. Sure, Wilt, sure. Whatever you say.

  "When people are eating their food, that's when you've got them. 
  Check to see how many times they bite into the food, boy. Five, 
  ten, those are fine numbers. Twenty's even fine. Up to 
  twenty-two, you've got no problems. But if that person sinks 
  their teeth into the food one more time, twenty-three, and then 
  swallows, they're in on it. They chew their food twenty-three 
  times, then down it goes. Those are the people who work for 
  Satan. Got it, Jim?"

  "Twenty-three times," I said, and nodded yet again.

  "Good, good boy. Now, you've got to be careful -- all sorts of 
  people are in on it. I remember seeing one of those state 
  dinners on TV, and Gerald Ford was eating sirloin steak. Sure 
  enough, twenty- three bites. Not even Clarkesburg's safe. My 
  wife made chicken for the mayor one night last year, and like 
  clockwork, he chewed on each piece of that bird twenty-three 
  times."

  There was a knock from the house at this point. Mrs. Wilt had 
  opened a window from the kitchen and was looking out at us.

  "Don't scare the boy, dear," she said. "Come on back inside."

  He waved, nodded, and started back in. Why did I have the 
  feeling that Mrs. Wilt had seen her husband behave like this 
  before?

  "Not a word, Jim," he said. "Not a word."

  It turns out that I chew my food about eight times before I 
  swallow it. I counted. Wilt probably counted my chewing too -- 
  before he took me out to the old shed, he made sure I didn't 
  swallow after my 23rd bite of Erma's bacon, eggs, and pancakes 
  and swallow.

  After 23 bites, all food is reduced to nothing but a disgusting 
  wet paste, made more of spit than of food.

  I guess that's how Satan likes it.

  Do You Have Some Time?  by Mary Anne Walters
==============================================

  He looked down at the gold Rolex on his wrist. The time was 
  1:00, Eastern Standard Time. He thought, once again, that there 
  is never enough time.

  "Excuse me, do you have some time?" A simple question.

  She was tiny and pert looking, and very well-dressed. She was 
  also in a hurry. There was no time to stop and chat. With an 
  irritated glance at her watch she said, "Yes, it's 1:00," and 
  went to move on.

  "No, no, no. I didn't say 'Do you have the time.' I said 'Do you 
  have some time." You see, I've run out and need some more."

  Her eyes glazed over, and the look on her face was one that most 
  people save for use only when they are required to deal with a 
  child, a fool, or a lunatic. "I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. I have 
  no time for this."

  With that, she scurried off, like a tiny, pert looking rat in a 
  maze, rushing nowhere, but determined to get there on time 
  nonetheless.

  He sighed. He walked a block more. Turning, his eyes scanned the 
  crowd. They were all rushing. But, there, in the shadow of a 
  building, was a young man in jeans and a tee shirt. The T-shirt 
  said IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, I HAVE THE TIME. Quickly, he walked 
  over to the young man and said, "I have the money. Do you have 
  some time for me?"

  "Sure, dude. I got all the time in the world." The boys vapid 
  face was surrounded by stringy blond hair. There was a bit of 
  fuzz on his upper lip. The boy grinned, but it looked more like 
  a leer to the man, who cringed.

  "While I doubt you do, in fact, have all the time in the world, 
  I would like to avail myself of some of the time you do have. 
  You see, I seem to have run out of time myself, and I could use 
  a little more. So, if you will tell me how much you charge for 
  your time, it will be easy for me to compute what amount of 
  money I will need to acquire the amount of time I desire. I have 
  found that 24 hours in a day is just not enough--I, myself, 
  would prefer about 32 hours..." As he spoke, he say the boy's 
  leering smile turn to a scowl.

  "Buzz off, buddy. One thing for damn sure is that I got no time 
  for weirdos like you!" The boy sauntered away and resumed his 
  languid pose in another shadowy corner, where he was soon 
  approached by a timid little man with a bald head, glasses 
  sliding off the end of his nose, and the look of a rabbit 
  gathering the courage to sneak under the fence into the cabbage 
  patch.

  He sighed again, heavier. Once more, he scanned the crowd. He 
  needed someone with time to spare, but who understood the 
  importance and the value of time. People in a hurry had no time 
  to spare. People who seemed to have an abundance of time, like 
  the boy, were somewhat unbalanced. He searched for the perfect 
  mix.

  There, on a park bench, was an older man, reading. He wasn't 
  reading a book (took too much time) or a magazine, but was 
  reading the newspaper--and not just the headlines, either. Aha! 
  Could this be the one? He approached slowly.

  "Excuse me, sir. Do you have some time?"

  The man on the bench was wearing a rather wide, garishly 
  patterned, luridly colored tie. His suit was on the dusty side 
  of grey, made of some thick material that gave off a damp-closet 
  smell. He looked up, and answered in a booming voice, "Sure, the 
  time is 1:24."

  NO, No, No, NO! Not THE time, SOME time! I wanted SOME time!"

  "Well, there's no time like the present. What time did you want?

  "Did you want some of my time? I'm usually a little short of it 
  myself. Hey, maybe I should take some of your time! Heh, heh, 
  heh. Actually, you're in luck. I have some spare time right now. 
  We could spend some time together. And, speaking of time, let me 
  show you some of my samples." The loud man spoke fast, in a 
  machine-gun-like stream of patter. He looked down, reeling from 
  the assault on his senses. The loud man was opening up his 
  briefcase and there within it was a display of watches, all 
  cheap, and all ticking. The hours were wasting away before his 
  very eyes. With a look of horror, he flung a hand up over his 
  face, as if to ward off a blow, and blocked the sight from his 
  eyes. He recoiled, and looked for a way to escape this wretched 
  man.

  "Wait! Don't go! My bus is late. Stick around for a while--we 
  can kill some time together."

  That was it. The final straw. He spun on his heels and fled.


  The bus driver was only trying to make up for lost time. That 
  broken traffic light put him way off schedule. Now, time was of 
  the essence. He had to be on time--not early, not late. His 
  record was one of the best, and he was proud of it. And, he was 
  mad at the delay that had robbed him of the precious minutes and 
  had made him late. With all these thoughts on his mind, it was 
  no wonder he never saw the well-dressed, wild-eyed, and 
  generally harried looking man that dashed out in front of the 
  bus. By the time he realized, it was too late.

  "Shit! Now I'll never get back on schedule!" This thought was 
  echoed by the majority of the people on the bus, to include the 
  tiny, pert, well-dressed woman who got on at the last stop, as 
  well as by the timid, balding man in the car behind the bus 
  (whose passenger was a dirty, languid blond boy, his lip curled 
  into a leer).

  A loud and damp smelling man stepped off the curb and walked 
  over to where the previously well-dressed (but now considerably 
  rumpled) man lay, sprawled in the street, still as a stone. He 
  reached down and took the gold Rolex of the now-broken wrist. 
  The bus driver walked over, unsure whether he should attempt to 
  stop this ghoulish act.

  "Don't worry," the loud man assured the bus driver, "I saw the 
  whole thing--this guy stole one of my samples, then ran out into 
  the street, right in front of you. That's what happened, all 
  right." The loud man replaced the gold watch with a cheap 
  imitation, and let the wrist drop back to the pavement. "That's 
  what I'll tell the police." He winked a particularly nasty wink 
  at the bus driver, who breathed a sigh of relief nonetheless. 
  The loud man laughed.

  "I guess his time ran out, hey buddy?"

  The Talisman  by Greg Knauss
==============================

  Duncan watched as the fat little disk that had so shaped his 
  life bounded up and down in front of him. He stared at it 
  intently, almost hypnotized by its motion -- so regular, he 
  thought, so precise, so easily controlled. He flicked his wrist 
  in a thoughtless motion and the flattened sphere obeyed his 
  command, knowing what he wanted without him speaking.

  God, I love that, Duncan thought.

  It hadn't always been as easy as it was now, sitting here. They 
  had taunted him back when he had cared, called him meaningless 
  things that had seemed tremendously cruel at the time. Worst of 
  all, they made fun of IT. The disk, the one thing he loved.

  DUN-CAN, DUN-CAN, THE YO-YO MAN! DUN-CAN, DUN-CAN, THE YO-YO 
  MAN!

  The yo-yo sped up and down a little faster as he remembered, his 
  motions became a little more intense. He never had to look at 
  the yo- yo while he used it, but now he stared intently into the 
  distance, his jaw-line hardening, his eyes no longer those of a 
  nine-year-old.

  He didn't blame his parents. He loved them more than he would 
  have normally -- they gave him this friend on a string when he 
  was only two years old. He had taken to it immediately, quickly 
  becoming an expert in the yo-yo parlor tricks of the early 
  eighties.

  He had taken it to his first day of school, clutching the 
  smallish plastic disk instead of his mothers skirt and soon the 
  older kids began to lay into him.

  HEY, DUN-CAN THE YO-YO MAN! PEOPLE WHO CARRY YO-YOS WET THE BED!

  YEAH, DUN-CAN! WASSA MATTER? YOU WET THE BED?

  HA HA HA HA!

  He tried to ignore them. He tried to find friends with common 
  interests, friends he could relate to, but nobody at school 
  seemed to be interested in yo-yos. He told his parents about the 
  big kids making fun of him, but they didn't understand. They 
  wanted to take his yo-yo away! They said that if that was the 
  only thing causing the trouble he should stop taking it to 
  school.

  They didn't understand. His yo-yo was the only thing that kept 
  him happy, kept him safe. He loved his yo-yo, and his yo-yo 
  loved him, he was sure of it.

  He was getting better, too. He had moved past everyone he had 
  seen on TV and was now inventing tricks of his own. His beloved 
  yo-yo would whiz around, up and down, back and forth at speeds 
  where he could no longer follow it with his eye. But he knew 
  where it was at all times -- he and the yo-yo were one, 
  connected by twine.

  One day, during recess, he was in a corner of the playground, 
  casually using his yo-yo, when he was approached by the group of 
  bigger kids who found endless fun in mocking his love.

  HEY, HEY, DUN-CAN. HOW'S THE OLD YO-YO? LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

  CAN I HAVE IT?

  Duncan froze, the yo-yo spun up its string and he closed his 
  fist quickly around it. No, he thought. No, no, no . . .

  YEAH, IT LOOKS MIGHTY GOOD.

  MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE IT.

  No! Duncan's wrist flipped up and the yo-yo shot out from his 
  open palm. It hit the big kid in the stomach and he looked as if 
  he'd been hit with a fist. The kid doubled over as the yo-yo 
  swung back towards Duncan. He whipped it behind him, over him 
  and down, in a high, graceful arc, into the back of the kid's 
  head. There was a soft crack.

  UUNGH.

  The kid was on the ground. He could have been sleeping, but 
  there was a yo-yo embedded in the base of his skull.

  The other kids scattered away from Duncan as he flicked his 
  wrist and forced the yo-yo up its string into his palm. He 
  smiled.

  The yo-yo rolled steadily up and down its string as he wandered 
  away.

  He was sitting on the curb now, slowly rubbing the blood off his 
  yo-yo. He could hear sirens in the distance and he supposed soon 
  they would find him and want to take him away. He knew what he 
  had done was a bad thing, but just letting that kid take his 
  yo-yo would have been worse.

  He supposed they might try to hurt him, but Duncan wasn't really 
  worried.

  His yo-yo would protect him.


  Schrodinger's Monkey  by Greg Knauss
======================================

  If nothing else, it explains a lot.

  For those with a technical education in physics, it seems the 
  Everett-Wheeler-Graham interpretation of quantum indeterminacy, 
  with a few addendums, turns out to be correct. For those 
  without, a little explanation is needed.

  Physics, for years now, has had a central question: What is 
  wrong with quantum mechanics? Quantum mechanics is a method of 
  calculating values on the atomic and sub-atomic level, a little 
  like Newtonian mechanics can be used to calculate values on a 
  larger scale. Newtonian formulas can predict where a rock will 
  fall if someone throws it in the air, quantum formulas try to do 
  the same thing for atoms.

  But it never worked quite right. Newtonian physics, real-world 
  physics, always comes up with one specific answer -- it many not 
  be the right answer, say, if some factor was forgotten, or some 
  measurement misread, but it is always a single answer. Quantum 
  physics, though, always produces more than one answer, ALL of 
  which are technically, mathematically correct. It's called 
  "indeterminacy." Newton says the rock will land HERE; quantum 
  mechanics says that the rock will land HERE and HERE and HERE.

  This is, of course, impossible.

  In the real world you can't have more than one answer. It's not 
  a question of actually throwing the rock and seeing where it 
  lands. The formulas should provide one answer, and one answer 
  only. Period.

  Schrodinger came up with his famous cat to try to illustrate the 
  problem. Imagine: there's a box, with no holes or windows, that 
  contains a cat. The cat has some sort of lethal device hooked up 
  to it -- I always liked to think of it as a guillotine, but 
  Schrodinger used poisonous gas -- that can be triggered by some 
  nameless quantum event.

  Now, after a specific period of time, is the cat dead? Quantum 
  mechanics will return a number of answers, one of which might 
  say that the cat has been killed, another of which might not. So 
  without opening the box, is the cat dead or alive? Schrodinger 
  said it was both -- an obviously false statement --just to 
  point out that quantum mechanics has a gaping hole in it.

  There were a number of explanations for what was going on. 
  Einstein had the Hidden Variable, Von Neumann and Finkelstein 
  had Quantum Logic, Bohr had the Copenhagen Interpretation, 
  Walker and Herbert had "Consciousness" Nonlocality, Sarfatti had 
  "Information" Nonlocality. They were all attempts to rectify 
  what quantum mechanics predicted with what actually happened, 
  ways of looking at the universe to make it fit quantum answers.

  As it turns out, events have proven Drs. Everett, Wheeler and 
  Graham correct. Their model suggested, perhaps fancifully, that 
  for every indeterminacy -- every Schrodinger's Cat -- an 
  entirely new universe is created, exactly the same as the first, 
  but for that single quantum event. In one universe, the cat 
  would be dead; in the other it would be alive.

  Of course, quantum events are happening by the trillions every 
  second, by the trillions of trillions. Universes would be 
  splitting and re-splitting and splitting again, taking every 
  possible course imaginable. Judging by the rough estimate that 
  the universe is 10 billion years old, the number of entirely 
  separate universes is beyond human imagining. The amount is 
  inconceivable.

  I suppose it should be obvious that eventually they'd run out of 
  room.


  The way I see it -- and this is just my particular model, 
  obviously derived in a hurry, last night -- each universe acts 
  something like an atom of hydrogen might, enclosed in a glass 
  jar. When there are only a few hydrogen atoms, they float about 
  freely, gaseous, and rarely collide. This is the Gas State.

  If these atoms, however, were able to duplicate themselves, 
  along the lines of Everett-Wheeler-Graham, the jar would slowly 
  begin to get crowded. Collisions with divergent universes 
  explain a lot of what we're seeing.

  Of course these collisions would become more frequent, and 
  pressure would eventually begin to build. As more atoms were 
  created, eventually liquid hydrogen -- the Liquid State -- would 
  condense out of the ever more crowded gas. Collisions would be 
  innumerable nearly constant, even.

  And that's what's happening to us. I don't claim to know what 
  the "jar" is -- Thornton Wilder would probably call it "the Mind 
  of God" -- but I think that collisions don't take place 
  physically, at least not in the lower three dimensions. There's 
  no thud of our universe running into another one.

  Universes seem to "tap" each other lightly -- perhaps there's 
  some sort of natural repulsion or elasticity -- and only a small 
  exchange takes place. Parts of the other universe slosh over 
  into ours and parts of ours spill over into it, following some 
  upper-dimensional conservation of momentum, like giant bowls of 
  milk.


  What does this mean in practical terms? If nothing else, it 
  explains a lot.

  It explains Jesus rising from the grave, for instance. Say three 
  days after his crucifixion, there was a rare Gas State collision 
  with a universe where he wasn't killed, and their Christ was 
  bumped to our world.

  It explains what happened to a Spanish book that disappeared 
  from my locker in high school.

  It explains what happens to everyone's car keys, and the one 
  sock that's always missing from the dryer.

  lt explains Atlantis and Big Foot and the Loch Ness monster and 
  unicorns and every other myth or legend in the world.

  It explains why there's another me, very close to an exact 
  duplicate as far as I can tell, sitting in the kitchen gorging 
  himself on bananas. We talked for a long time last night, after 
  he appeared in my bathroom, and the only glaring difference we 
  found between our universes was that in his, bananas never 
  evolved. Some quantum event far back in the past prevented 
  whatever it was that eventually became bananas from mutating in 
  a certain way. He -- the other me -- loves them, and has eaten 
  over three dozen by my count.

  Now that the universes are condensing into the Liquid State 
  we'll be seeing a lot more of that sort of thing. I wonder how 
  much longer some sort of societal order will hold out. Somehow I 
  doubt people will be too concerned with the law if they know 
  that everything they know as fact might cease to exist at any 
  particular moment.

  And I wonder how long we have before the Solid State.
