        Since my first copy of "Interesting things you should know" was so
popular, I figured I would give you ever MORE useless things you should know.

                 London's Big Ben is neither a clock or a tower.
                 Cleopatra was not Egyptian.
                 Lizzie Borden was aquitted.
                 Lots of people had flown nonstop across the Atlantic
                  before Lindburgh.
                 No witches were burned at Salem.
                 Sherlock Holmes never said "Elementary, my dear Watson".
                 Thomas Edison did not invent the Light Bulb.
                 Mark Twain was not born in Hannibal, Missouri.
                 There is no such thing as an aphrodisiac.
                 Bats do not have "Radar".
                 Bears do not hibernate.
                 The Battle of Bennington was not fought in Bennington.
                 Black eyed peas aren't even peas.
                 The Black Hills of South Dakota aren't hills, and they
                  aren't black.
                 There is no such doccument as the British constitution.
                 Caesar wasn't killed in the Capitol.
                 Camel's hair brushes are actually made from squirrel hair.
                 Catgut is not made from cats.
                 Chop Suey is not a Chinese dish.
                 In the real story of Cinderella, there is no glass slipper.
                 Coffee beans aren't really beans at all.
                 Copper bracelets don't cure arthritis.
                 Daddy longlegs are not spiders.
                 A cyclone is neither a tornado, a hurricane, or even a
                  wind.
                 There is no law against mutilating or defacing coins.
                 Dogs do not "Sweat through their tongues".

        Anyhow that's enough for one sitting... Don't be deceived anymore by
the falsehoods spread by mankind! Revolt! Rape your mother <well maybe not>!
