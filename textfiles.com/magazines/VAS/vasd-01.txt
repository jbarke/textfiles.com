        Well, right about now you are probably saying "What The HeLL?!? What
Happened to the small issues of VaS I am used to seeing?". Well We have
recently decided to make VaS more of a "group" effort and make it a weekly
magazine. We are still the fun-loving anarchists that we always have been and
always will be, we just figured this way it would be a lot more interesting
to read. We will also be having lots more internet stuff in here along with
other things new to VaS.
        We will be recruiting new writers, so if you can write, or know others
who would like to write, then feel free to contact me on LiVE WiRE bbs or on
the Internet if you have access to it. The magazine will be coming out once
each week, on fridays. So the issues will vary in size from week to week, so
we need your help to keep it alive. If you feel you have something interesting
to share with us, be it a textfile on anything from computer-underground stuff
or drug information to original stories or what-have-you, please send it to me
on LiVE WiRE.
        Also, we are always searching for distribution sites for VaS. We don't
care how /<raD your board is or anything, as long as you are willing to call
and get the new VaS issues from LiVE WiRE once a week or so, you should be
able to get in, as long as there isnt already a distribution site in your area
code. You are also welcome to call LiVE WiRE and download all 85 of the old
VaS single-topic files which are always free downloads.

Accessing the IRC.

Ok, I  know  many of you  lamers out there  have absolutly  NO  idea what
IRC is so lemme explain it in plain english. IRC is basicly a "chat-line" 
of sorts.  The only  diffrence between  this and any  old  multi-node bbs
with  node to  node chat, is that  you can talk  to virtualy thousands of 
people from all over the world. Sounds cool eh? "But how do I get to it?" 
you  ask.  Well,  if you have  a bit of  knowledg  about the internet you 
should have no problem with this.  

         All you have to do is:

      1) Get  on the  internet. (If you  don't know what the internet is, 
         well, thats your problem.)  
        
      2) Simply : telnet dood.cheme.cmu.edu 6667

      C) Ok, your there, but nothing's happening.  All you have to do now
         is this:    
                
         USER <yourfirst> <yourlast> 1 1  <CR>     (Don't forget the 1 1)
                
         NICK <An Eleet Handle of your choice>  <CR>
       
      4) Hey,  cool, you got  that funky  "welcome" message. "Now What?"
         Well,  this is  the real  FUN  part.  Type  LIST  for a list of 
         confrences.  There  are PLENTY of them, and they don't pause so 
         read FAST!

      E) You join a confrence. (What a novel idea!) to do this simply 
         type  
               
         Join #confrence name
       
      6) Wow,  neato,  cool,  and all  that crap.  You've  just joined a
         confrence  (Creaming you  bugel boy's as any lamer would).  Now 
         you  can either  introduce your-self  by typeing something like

         privmsg #confrence-name Hey all!

         or you could just sit back and try and figure out what the hell
         everyone is talking about. 

      X) There  is  TON's more.  But  that should  be enough  to get you 
         started. 

Well, thats  all for this tip, hope  it helps you lamers out a bit. Stay 
tuned to VaS for more stupid little InterNet tips for lamers.

        If any of you guys in 3i3 have read the new issues of a electro-mag
called DAMMiT you will probably laugh at the lameness of the dorks who
obviously think they too will be /<-k0oL like us at VaS if they made their
own magazine. After careful review of some of their issues, we have found them
to be quite lame, most of the 'authors' are a bunch of dorks who arent funny,
and have no knowledge of anything of interest to anyone except Bhuddist monks
in Niggeria, Afrikka.
        The included the message "We are not trying to compete with VaS, that
would be insane". Well for a bunch of losers like you guys, it would be more
than insane, it would be impossible, because you guys write the shittiest
magazine (I have personally read better phone books) in the entire world, let
alone the lamerville of 3i3.
        Anyhow greets g0 out to all the good magazines out there <VaS, vAs, VAS,
vas, etc>. And DAMMiT, give it up, you suck the sweat off Grizzly Adams' sac.

I am sure that I speak for all of us when I say that the censorship lawz in
America suck.  I mean face it... this country is getting less and less phree
as we speak.  They won't let us do anything.  I can maybe understand this
shit when yer like 8 or 9.. but hell.. most of us are over 16 years old.. and
its not like we never heard the words before.. and its not like we don't use
them!  I mean.. as metallica would say "What the hell?".  We have to do 
something.. and we have to do it soon or most of us will be 18.. and be able
to buy the shit.. and not have the priviledge of fighting these bastards.
Its mostly the large chain storez that do this.. Musicland, Harmony House,
Record Town.. etc.. and we dont' have to put up with this SHIT anymore.  We
have to ban together as a group and fight these guyz.  Steal Steal Steal..

Ok.. they won't sell us the tapes.. and they expect us to just LEAVE?.. WRong
here are some tips on Stealing tapes:

1.  Make sure all wrappings are off of the tapes.. it is easy if you bring
some sort of pencil or pen to break the wrapping.. make sure that you do
this near the back of the store.. some of them are really large...

2.  When stealing CDS.. DO NOT take the box.. its almost impossible to 
smuggle one of those fuckers out there.. so make sure you get the cd out of 
the box.. and then put the box behind some others.. so they will not notice
for awhile.. and you'll be long gone

3.  Steal their best sellerz.. keep yer hands off that country shit that they
have.. that is where you want to take the wrappings off.  No one would expect
some country mother fucker to be stealin would they?.. 

4.  There are also things in these stores besides tapes.. and CDS.. get some
head cleaners.. (no not your dick) /  Headphones.. and some of them even
have Nintendo gamez etc.. 

5.  Another thing that you can do in some of these places is change the price
letterz.  Ya know how they have like J=9.95 or whatever.. on some of them
you can change them.. do that (you can also do that at some taco bells (some
of the price numbers can be rolled.. just a little info fer ya.)..

Ok.. once you have done this.. you get a ton of people together and bring 
them in.. bring a bunch of bangerz and burn outs in there.. and just hang
out in there.. scare people away.. etc.. we have to band together and win
back our territory!  This fuckin' country takes just about everything away
from us.. don't let them take our music too.

        Since this is another new feature of VaS, we will start off with THE
FTP site for the computer underground. This being FTP.EFF.ORG , The only site
I have EVER seen that has ALL the Phracks, ALL the CUDs, and ALL The EFFectors
(Since they produce the EFFectors heh). Look in the \pub\cud directory, lots
of other stuff there too, PPPs, NIAs, etc. It is run by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a group of people who fight for the freedom of computer
users and stuff. There are also hundreds of essays on computer crime there as
well. Enjoy!

        Ameritech Corp. said last week that it negotiated a deal to purchase
local-loop, fiber-optic cables and other related equipment from DSC
Communications Corp. In Plano, Texas. By buying the equipment in bulk, they
were able to get the cost down to the price of copper cable. They say that in
the next 2 to 5 years, fiber cable in the "local loop" will be common.
=============================================================================
        AT&T's Secure Communications System division acquired public-key
cryptology licenses last week from Public Key Partners which will allow it
to develop devices for secure voice, data, fax, cellular and video
communications. The licenses will give AT&T access to all forms of public-key.

        A Thailand security company has produces a self-described "virus
factory" that may cause comptuer owners to change the ways that they detect
and remove viruses.
        The project, called XVIR can double the number of known computer
virus variants in a period of 2 hours, as it is capable of producing 600
viruses per hour, each one possesing a 1-byte modification of the Jerusalem-B
virus, and each one being distinct from the others.
=============================================================================
        In similar news, there is a program called Virus Creations Lab (VCL)
that is being distributed on bulletin boards all across the country which
gives the user the ability to program very easily their own viruses. It will
let the user choose the way the virus looks, acts, and what damage it does.
According to recent information, McAffe's ViruScan program will detect all
viruses this package creates.
