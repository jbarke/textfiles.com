        Well Im sure since you have been reading VaS, you are quite lame and
wish to become a totally ]<-RaDiCaL do0d like us here at VaS. Well we at VaS
feel that most KrAd d0oDz are complete Losers, so we are not KRad d0oDZ. But
since you are such faithful readers, I will tell you exactly how to be the
most k-RaD dEwd on yer block.
        First of all, you have to dress like a totally kraD moDeM geek. You
will probably start off with something like this:

        - The haircut. A standard bowl cut will do fine.
        - Some K-RaD 'TRAXX' Shoes From Yer LoCal Kmarts or some nifty
          converse all-stars. (Must be purple or green).
        - White Socks with Yellow, Green, And Orange stripes pulled all
          the way up to your knees.
        - Some swell green or brown courderoy 'Toughskins' pants with a
          superman or batman knee patch.
        - A grey tshirt with an iron-on transfer with either a fisherman
          or a truck driver on it.
        - A fake gold chain.
        - Some Nifty $.99 sunglasses from Big Lots.
        - A Foam hat with mesh backing for either the NRA or American Fishing
          association.
        - You must have a peach fuzz moustache/beard. This is most important
          to being kraD.
        - One of those nifty watches with a calculator and donkey kong built
          into it, with the alarm set to go off every 5 minutes.
        - Some Dukes of Hazzard suspenders.

        Now that you are totally stylin like a massive computer geek, you will
have to buy a new computer system. Since you will be doing so much work, you
will probably need a system like this.

        - IBM PC XT <4.77 mhz only, none of this 'turbo' shit>.
        - either a 300 baud or MAYBE a 1200 baud modem <only if you cannot
          find a 300 baud modem, and then set your term to dial out at 300>.
        - 1 360k floppy drive.
        - 1 CGa Monitor <cant go with monochrome or n0ne of YeR WaRezzz Will
          work riGht>.
        - If your feeling totally rich, go out and buy a krad 10 meg hard
          disk to store all your WaRREzzZZZZZ on.
        - 1 KmaRt Vic-20 daisy printer nigger-rigged to work on yer IbM.
        - 1 AtAri 26oo joystick nigger rigged again to work on the iBM.
          (u WilL nEed ThiS to PlAy yEr KrAd WAreezzzz>
        - 1 9153315135 volt protection power strip to protect all this krad
          valuable stuff.

        Ok you are all dressed up and got yer krad system ready to roll. So
now what? First of all, you must find some krad boards to call. The ones to
look for have ads like any of these:

        - kaLL mE! 313-NOT-UPYETBUTVERYSOON.
          Ill HaVe 3,421,355 gigs and 0 day WaRez!!!111!!111

           (And the new user password will either be
           "nupsuck" or "lamer").

        Wow, now that you got lots and lots of krad boards you kall, you can
download lots of neet0 xxx gifs, wack off all day long, d/l some waRez from
some system with no ratio, read lots of DAMMiT magazines, and dont forget on
every new board you call to be sure to inform the sysop that you are in fact
"a ]<-rAd eLiTe Do0d".
        Please note that VaS dist sites come and go, they usually have all
the recent issues, but always will have at least SoME of them. After all, I
doubt anyone is gonna actually read them all.
