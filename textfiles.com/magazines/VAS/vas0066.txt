This is a great one to make anybody angry on Christmas. I call it "Santa's 
Logic Bomb", it is a (VERY, VERY) simple logic bomb written in Basic. It is not
a virus and does not spread. It is susposed to be a Vital File Validator, but,
heh, it will really fuck up anybody who runs it on Christmas Day (12-25). It
will delete all the files in the current directory. If you know BASIC (Who
doesen't???), you will see some shitty programming. This was for two reasons.

a.)  To make the .EXE bigger (not a problem with QB!).

b.)  To make any retard who looks in the .EXE find some stuff that makes
the program look legitimate.

It does not use SHELL "COMMAND /C DEL *.*" but instead SHELL CM$ + SEX$ + 
PUSSY$, you get what I mean. It uses dummy strings to make any asshole who 
looks in the .EXE and reads it, look legitimate. When you run it, here's
what it does:

prints the info (program name, purpose)
tells you it's working
sends the current directory into a file with the name of today's date
deletes that file
if today is 12-25-xx, delete all files in current dir

SysValid comes in this VAS file in SYSVALID.ZIP which contains SYSVALID.EXE
and some fake dox. (I even gave credit for the program to Patrick Gallagher, 
Jr., who is the director of National Computer Security Center, and I used his
real address and phone numbers!) For fun, you may want to run this program
(Any day except Christmas will do!) and see what is looks like. Have phun!
I'll have a big laugh when half of the fucking 517 geeks loose config.sys
and autoexec.bat and command.com and all the shit they store in their
current directory!!
