        Welcome to yet another issue of VaS digest. We actually seem to be
able to put these things out at a somewhat decent pace and keep them somewhat
intersting to read, so hey - we're doing pretty good.
        Anyhow, we here at VaS are considering sort of a VASC0N kinda deal
(yeah we're gonna rip off the old SummerCon/HoHoCon bit). We are looking for
any other major t-file groups that would be interested in joining forces to
undertake this somewhat massive project. If you might be intersted (and don't
write for LeeCH) let us know on the VaS world HQ.
        So enough of the lame ass introduction and on what may possibly be
the most /<-RaD issue of VaS ever...

    For all who D/led digest 6 a few weeks ago and were wondering, this is 
 now the official issue 6. LAT must have been really stoned when he released
 this last issue. Anyway, we cut the duplicate articles and added a few more.
 Look for VaS stickrZ and shirts in fy00tChEr issues.

        Anyhow, Just in case you guys were wondering, We here at VaS were
solely responsible for the Holocaust, the failure of the Bay of Pigs, the
assasination of JFK (We think the lamers over at LEECH mag were the ones who
went after Reagan since they fucked it up like usual), the strange crop
patterns in Europe, the mutilation of farm animals in the midwest, all the
floods that have been happening lately (we HaCKed The oCeaNz d00D!), and
for Bill Clinton getting elected.

Hey dudeS!! This is l33ch Hacker man!!! I am here today to tell
you some new scams I learned from the ultimate hackers! LEECH!!!

Scam 1: Mother

Ok go up to your mom and say you will cut the grass... Then ask her for
some money for cutting the grass b4 you do it<Notice the b4! isnt it cool!>
Ok now go and spend the money without cutting the grass!!!! You just scammed!

Scam 2: Coin Trick

Ok what you need is a penny.... I dont know where to get these but The Grim 
Phreaker<Another Cool Leech Hacker!!!> said that they were reallly hard to 
get.. Try scam 1 to get one... Anyway what you have to do is get the penny
and go to some l00s3r!! [Someone who is really big and muscular] say hey man
i bet you 10 dollars that this penny will land on its head... Of course being
the idiot he is he will say ok![If he says no he is a leech Hackur d00d!!]
Then throw the penny in the air..... Let it land on the ground. It will spin 
for awile [I dont know how it works! If anyone has a Tfile on how Coins work
send it to me!] if it lands on heads he has to give you 10 dollars! If it 
lands on tails just say that the coin cheated and make him give you 10$!!

Scam 3: Bank Scam!

This is REAL HARD so watch out [Only L33ch HackuRz think this is easy and 
pull it off without a sweat!]. What you do is go to a bank and go to one
of the real dumb people that have thingies on thier chest [Anyone have a Tfile
on These peeple? They have dumb names like Jenny and Anna! I dont like them!]
Say 'My name is Nick Shitco and I lost my wallet... I was wondering if you 
can give me some money... Say like 7$?'..... Now she has two options

        1] Give the money
        2] Dont give you the money  [Dont ask me how i found out! I had to 
                                     read ToP-SeCReT to get that info!   ]

If she gives you the money you have to thank this person.. You have to pull 
down your pants and then you wave your ===DINGER=== around your nose!! [ I
learned this from a cool l33ch hacker!]

If she dosent then you have to fit through those holes they have in the glass
to get in and get it your self!!! What a scam!!!!!!!

Scam 4: Bullet

Ok you need two people to do this! get a gun and put it in your mouth.. Then 
say 'I bet you that when I pull the trigger i can get more bullets down my 
throat then you! [Dont worry it doesnt hurt! only in the movies! [L33ch mommy
told me]]' He will laugh at you.. [What a dumb-ass he is]. So pull the
trigger three times...!! You are guarenteed to win... After all you have three 
bullets and he has none!!! You are rich!!!!



        Ok i hope this file was a help to all of you loosers trying to lead 
        a life of fraud that only a l33ch hackur d00d can!!!!!! C-U-l8r

From: chen@csri.toronto.edu (Chen Wang)

    Do you want to know if that special someone has saline implants?
Take her to Colorado, or Mexico City or anywhere that is in a very
different elevation.  Apparently, the saline implants get air bubbles
in them due to the change in air pressure and you can hear a
swishing and popping type sound.  So next time your boyfriend says
he just wants to listen..................

บ ฐฐ Serial Killing Made Easy ฐฐฐฐฐฐ บ Written By: Da Rapist                  บ
ศออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออสออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออผ

        Well this article will deal with the ins and outs of serial killing.
I know you all watch those fine tv shows like HARD COPY and the NEWS and see
those cool honkey serial killers (weird, you never see black serial killers)
who slice and dice people up for fun. Now you're probably sitting there
saying "hey, that looks pretty cool". Well yeah, it is. And if done right,
you might never get caught.
        The great thing about serial killing is that usually you don't get
caught very easily because you are killing a whole mess of people you DONT
KNOW and usually mutilating them beyond recognition (heh heh mutilation is
cool heh heh). Yes this is truly a fun sport. If you just keep a few minor
guidelines in mind, you will be assured of a fun slaughtering spree.
        First of all, most good serial killers want to target a specific
group to attack. I myself prefer to go after teenage sluts. They are by far
the most fun to degrade, then slaughter. However there's always old ladies,
blind people, retarded people, black people, etc. Although you can usually
be assured of a good time if you have a young attractive blonde singled out
and carry a copy of VaS's "Basic Rape Techniques" in your back pocket.
        Now the next part is deciding on a few murder weapons. In order to
avoid getting the murders linked, its usually a good idea to vary the methods
of killing. For example, you may want to drive a wooden stake through your
first victim's skull, and then peel off the skin on his limbs. Then for your
second victim you might want to drill a 7/16" hole in their chest to stun them,
and then reach down their throat, and pull their internal organs out. This one
always gets a few odd stares from passersby.
        For locations of murder, this one is always tricky. You dont want to
do it anywhere where someone might hear the screams of a person having his
eyeballs removed from their sockets. I prefer to do my killing around lunchtime
in fairly loud places. For example, in the bathroom at a crowded, noisy
resteraunt. After finishing him off, put him in a stall, lock the door, and
crawl out from under to make your escape (after washing your hands well of
course - we do want to be sanitary , eh?). Now it will be a few hours before
someone finds him (usually not until the end of the night when they have the
retard janitors coming in to clean up, and they notice a pile of steaming
entrails laying on the floor.
        Of course finally, in order to authenticate the serial killing, you
will want to leave some sort of sign that it was you. I personally like to
leave a copy of VaS's "Penis News Flash" in their wallet. This way they know
it's me doing it (they just dont know who "me" is, heh-heh). Now I don't
think leaving your home phone number or anything like that would be a good
original idea, but how about leaving maybe a picture of Nick Sitko (The Grim
Phreaker of 810 Lame Fame) or something stupid like that...
        Anyhow I hope you find this information extremely useful and decide
to go on a bloody rampant killing spree. Hey, why not slaughter every lamer
in your area code (I am plotting this one out for 313 AC as we speak). So
go out and have a good time, and save some kidneys for me!

       Well after a long vacation, we have finally tracked down the wherabouts
of that famed s00peR haCquEr ]<-aPTiN /<-RaD! We located him somewhere near
Alabama incesting small farm animals and peeing in the slurpee machines in
7-11. After a brief chat, We feel we can fill you in on THE FURTHER ADVENTURES
OF KAPTAIN KRAD...

        Shortly after his rendezvous with Paul Ruebens to save the world from
the evil FBI, KapTaIN KRaD decided that once again it was time to enter that
sacred realm of s00peRhaKeRd0m.
        Firing up his Pie-RaTTeD copy of QmoDem Pr0 For windowz (KaPTaIN KraD,

        Okay, so all my life I've been waking up in a cold sweat having 
dreams that one day I could actually write for VaS!!  That day has finally
come that I can unite with the RaDest guys on 'da scene.  Now don't doubt me,
YES I can be as obnoxious and ignorant as them!  Really I can!!  Fuck the
homos, fuck the blacks, fuck the jews, fuck anything that is or isn't me!! 
You ALL suck and VaS kicks everyone and everything's ass.  
        With that out of the way, I'll begin the file.  This file is not 
about the lates way to get ]<0d3z or the gNu |-|4C/<iNG 4 (_)NiX, no this 
file is for those of you with miserable, fucked up lives and you want to kill
yourself.  I have compiled several methods that you should employ in 
commiting suicide.  Remember one thing here, don't be boring.  Get dangerous.
Get exciting.  How many stupid suicides have you seen or heard about in your
life??  I'll say it once and I'll say it again(huh?): If you're going to kill
yourself then why not do something meaningful while you do it???
        Okay, the first thing that must be done is you must thourghly convice 
yourself that you do, in fact, want to die.  That part is easy...just look
at your pathetic life.  Reflect on it.  Need help still?  Fine.  Chant these
words to yourself: "I am a loser.  I spend every waking minute on a BBS.  
I have no girlfriend.  I'm ugly.  I smell bad.  My mom is a bitch.  No one
loves me.  I have no real friends.  I have no real talents.  I'm worthless."
That should just about do it.  If not, then just watch the Weather channel 
for about 5 minutes (15 if you can take it) and that should finish the job.
        The next part is the fun part that all suicide people should have...
of coarse!  The suicide note!!  What could make a suicide with out the 
suicide note?!  Now you can take the Kobain method and write a lame reason
for killing yourself (such as feeling like shit, having a worthless life),
but let me suggest a few methods...first the funny method.  What better way 
to end your life than with something that will make your loved ones laugh out
loud?  Because I'm so Elite, I have included a few examples:

        This letter is the best kind.  It's great fun to die knowing you 
have put a kind of guilt on a person that they will never forget.  Hey, you
might even get them to commit suicide too.  But no way will their letter be
better than yours(unless they were reading this great text file).. their's 
will say something like "..i just couldn't live with myself..." That wollows
in lamity compared to yours, huh?
        The next thing I'm going to discuss is the actual methods you can 
commit suicide.  This first part is the list of old, been-done, stupid things
that only lame suicide people do.

                        Suicide For Losers:
                        ------------------
                1) Hanging yourself
                2) Slitting your wrists
                3) Shooting yourself
                4) Stabbing yourself
                5) Jumping off a building
                6) Going into the bathtub with a toaster
                7) Overdosing on something

                        /<oo1 Suicide:
                        --------------

  1] METHOD ONE: The Sports Bomb.

        I've always been a strict believer in the philosophy that if you're
  gonna go, you should take as many innocent people with you as possible.  
  Enter: The Sports Arena.  That's right, either that or a Concert.  Any 
  place where you can get real close to as many people as possible.  Then all 
  you do is bring a grenade, a bomb, or some explosive...either stapped across
  your body or hidden away....and here's the kicker: YOU JUST BLOW UP WITH 
  THEM.  That's right, don't like whip it out and say "This is for Allah" or
  any shit like that...then people will all run away and that would suck.  No,
  the best thing to do is just go boom.  
        I'm not going into specific on how to make any bombs... you want to
  get technical shit?  Read Phrack or something.  Besides, you should all be 
  313+3 enough to make a bomb dammit.  

  2] METHOD TWO: Rape Spree.

        You are about to die.  So why the fuck can't you do something that
  you've always wanted to do??  Remember that girl and school with the really
  big tits that ignored you?!  I think it's about time you concocked a really
  intricate plan to GET her...after all, isn't she one of the reasons your
  doing this?  That's right!  Okay, what you need to is have prepared 
  handcuffs, ropes, chains, anything that you can tie her down with...Now
  the part that you are on your own with is getting alone with her in some
  deserted place...(No, Your Uncle Moggie wouldn't leave ya' without ANY 
  tips!  Here's one.. pick some deserted place somewhere and then run up to 
  her and tell her that her boyfriend is making our "BIG TIME" with some 
  chick (it would be wise to pick some bitch she would be envious of) at that
  location.  Then just accompany her there and your are home free.  Make 
  sure it's a deserted place, and make sure you have your matierals either 
  with you or planted at the site.  Remember a gag.  Also, you could brush up
  on your raping skills in the VaS "How to Rape" files.  Anyway, fuck her
  good and plenty.  Make sure you cup a really big feel...do it for me...or
  better yet, do it for VaS!  Then you kill yourself.  Make sure you don't 
  get too excited and kill her too.. remember it's important to leave 
  permanent psychological scars on the people you leave behind!

  3] Method Three: Public Assholes

        This is the most important one in my opinion.  Since you are going to
  just up and murder yourself, why don't you do something useful for humanity
  before you fucking just up and leave?!  Don't be a selfish jH00!  Do you
  know how many motherfucking asshole politicians there are in this goddam
  Capitalistim motherfucking bullshit government we have?!?  Do you know how
  many annoying ignorant obnoxious egocentric relegious leaders we have?!  Do
  you know how many money hungry self-centered entertainers are out there?!
  That says it all.  KILL ONE OF THEM!!  Don't leave without taking out of
  them with you or your a pathetic loser that did nothing with your 
  meaningless life.  I know if I was gonna go, I would take the Power Rangers
  with me!
        In conclusion, I would just like to say something simple.  You are 
  going to seise to exist if you kill yourself.  You might as well do 
  something crazy before you go... be it running away from home or whatever,
  if you plan to do the big "self-fuck", then why not have fun with it?

    Say your out of a job and need some money real fast, you just want to
 rake in the dough or you need money to support your guerilla armys takeover
 of the United States government. Well, if so, i have the ultimate, best LEGAL 
 scam here. Basically, what you will be doing is selling look alike common 
 household stuff as drugs to stoopid wannabe stoners. 

 I. Who do I sell to?

    If you go to high school, like me, you can rapidly get millions of clients.
 Look for preppie yuppie scum. There dadsies give them a lot of money for some
 reason and they are not very intelligent. Don't approach them with offers to
 sell because a lot of preppies are total goody-goodys and will nark on you.
 Listen for groups of them talking about "getting wasted", "hydroponic 
 redhairs", etc.. These also tend to be the alternative wannabe type and will
 usually be wearing flannels around there wastes and stussy hats. Try to join 
 there conversation and after a while you should offer to sell them some stuff.
 If you don't go to a high school, then you can find people Raves, Clubs, bars
 (not usually) or Crack Houses(not a good idea). Most schools will expel you
 for selling fake drugs, so be careful. Try to sell it to them out of school.
 However, the school will propably still try to expel you even if it is out of
 school. 

 II. Making Fake Drugs
  
   A. Pot
        
        Since this is the most common drug you will be selling, i will 
   describe it here. Usually, the buyer has never seen real pot before, so you
   can use Oregeno, basil or any mixture of spices. Make shure to grind at 
   least 50% of your mixture up before mixing it. This makes it look a little
   more real. Spices, however, have many disadvantages. They are not cheap
   and tend to have a pacific smell. The best recipe for making fake pot, 
   which will fool anyone but the real stoners is right here..

      Fake Pot

      Ingrediants: 
         Green Tea Leaves(Sold in bags)
         Flower buds(Fruit tree buds or flower buds. small)

         1. Get a plastic bag.

         2. Fill it will the desired ammount of tea leaves.

         3. Take buds at a 1:10 ammount to the tea leaves.
            Put theses buds in the microwave for about 30 seconds.
            Depending on the type of bud add more/less time.

         4. Mix together and sell.

   B. LSD

        This is the second most trendy drug today. Usually, the preps will
   have had no contact with it, so you can fuck with them. You will need to
   cut up a peice of plain white paper or more preferably blotter paper. The
   first method involes making a little dot with the tip of a pen in the 
   center of the peice of paper. The second involves a method in LeEcH mag. 
   The thing on microwaving morning glory petals on the paper will probably
   look like acid. You might also be able to drop some of the vile flavored
   non-carbonated mineral water that our cafeteria carries on some blotter
   paper and sell that. 

   C. Cocaine

        I don't recommend that you even bother with this one. You can't make
   as much money and the only people who would buy it would probably shoot 
   you. Anyway, don't use Suger or Salt. Flower would probably be the best
   to sell, but they will test it if you sell it in large quantitys, so don't
   bother. It's not worth it.

   D. Others

        It is to hard and costs more to manufacture fake nitrous, though you
   could give them CO2 cartridges and watch there brain freeze. It still is
   not worth it. You could shit or piss on mushrooms and sell them as ShroomZ.
   Put some vial liquid in a syringe and say it's heroin. They won't know the
   difference.

 III. Postmordem

    Usually, after you have sold someone something, they will tell you "Man,
 that stuff was great". Try to keep a straight face. Now, you can continue 
 to sell to him and his freinds until the trend changes. The reason most of 
 these people seem so stupid is because they never used the drug. They are 
 not buying the drug for the drug. They are buying it for status and to brag
 alone. However, once and a while, you will run into a prep who actually tries
 it. They will either tell you it was great or nothing happened. If they say
 the later, respond with something like "What are you talking about, i had 
 some of that last night and it ruled.". Usually, they will change there minds.
 If not, then who fucking cares. What are they going to do, call the cops and
 say the pot they bought from you wasn't real.

really, you don't hate any jewish individuals? that's strange because i
distinctly remember a comment along the lines of "just as i thought, i
have an oven waiting for you, you fucking ZOG agent".
And where exactly did you get the idea for ovens if aushwitz was just a
work camp. no one came out but thousands of people were brought in on
trains a day. nazi records document this. now unless aushwitz had massive
underground living faculties along with some kind of self contained food
production facilities (because minimal amounts were brought in), these
people had to be leaving through the chimney.
Wow, of the 16 or something million Jews alive today, 15,999 mourn the
dead of the holocaust, but this David Irving character doesn't think it
happened so i guess it didn't.
and whats this about a philosophical/political doctrine? (hear me out
here) the catholic church had a definite political agenda before the
protestant reformation, just ask the knights templar. and it still does to
a lesser extent, look how it bullied the world around at the population
summit a month or two ago. and i don't agree with its philosophical
aspects. but i don't hate the church, and i definitely don't hate
catholics. i even like some of the hierarchy, bishop tutu and father
aristide along with many unknown parish priests are all beautiful people.
i don't say things like "don't insult thousands of law abiding christians
by comparing them to catholics", but wozzel, the open minded graduate
student that he is wrote "don't insult thousands of law abiding semites by
comparing them to jews".
i agree that punk has some very conservative roots (the whole fuck hippies
mentality) but i don't give a fuck what dee dee ramones says, as far as
i'm concerned anyone in counter culture that advocates the nazis is a
moron. because the first thing the nazis did was crack down on the counter
culture. (after aryan cripples) communists, homosexuals and jazz artists
were the first ones sent to inhale cyclon-b, before the jews or the slavs.

"in the real fourth reich you'll be the first to go"
                                   -jello biafra




So you say.  But most thirty year old TAs I've known wouldn't that easily
be mistaken for 15 year old computer nerds with testosterone-impeded brain
functions.
And is Wayne State really a "major university?"  According to your own
reasoning, I should think not; more like Affirmative Action U., with you
there as a token white person. I'd like to see you try to peddle your
garbled antediluvian race theories at a real university like Berkeley or
Harvard or Michigan.

 (Please note: I think Wayne is a fine school, and gives an opportunity
for a college education to many people who might otherwise not get one. 
It's just too bad that its generous admission policies are abused by
people like Wozzel, who go there not so much for an education as to have
their previously existing prejudices confirmed.)

that has got to be about the most facist thing i've ever heard!  fuck, 
why don't we just destroy free speech and free thought while we're at it 
and TRULY keep america clean.  nazis (as much i hate everything they 
stand for) have as much of a right to think what they think and say what 
they say as anyone else.  when it crosses over into actual violence, 
that's when you have to draw the line.  let the nazis speak!  they 
usually do more harm to themselves by opening their mouths than any of us 
could do to them by opening ours.

This is total flame-bait and a nazi-wet-dream.
I'll let others blast away at the BS, but I can't pass up a chance to say
that
the Ramones were never punk-rock and had nothing to do with punk except they
di
not have mainstream appeal. NY Dolls-maybe,but never the Ramones. Look at all
the punk bands in 1976-Sex Pistols/Clash/Damned(1st "punk" album ever)/etc.
There
all British, don't sound anything like the Ramones, weren't long-hairs,
weren't
American. While I like the early Ramones, they'd fit into "new wave" more
than
anything punk. BTW, Wozzel is right that punk did have nazi-underpinnings-it
wasn't until '79 or so that the political slant went "leftward" and hardcore
bands like the DK's pushed the message.

 " Did 6 million really die, or was it just a zionist lie.
   Socialised Nazi scares of proof, why did they try to cover up the truth.
   Society cast National Socialism through, organized lies imposed by the jews

   Six Million of the Jewish race
   Evidence, there's not a trace.
   Impossibilitys of zyclon-B,
   They tried to fool, you and me."
                      - No Remorse "Zyclon-B"
 
 Introduction
 ------------
    The purpose of this series of textfiles is to uncover the lies and
 cover-ups of history as well as explore systems of government such as 
 anarchism and nazism which have been illegally censored while information
 on subjects worse, yet liked more by our government are encouraged such as
 communism. This first article shall deal with the best example of all:
 National Socialism. I will explain in this article, to the best of my
 ability how the holocaust was made up by the allies and the jewish religion
 to cover-up the fact that the allies were the aggressors in both world
 wars. The principals will also be explored. I have also found in political
 arguements, that my opponents in these arguements have never been able to
 come up with one valid arguement, while i had many. I ask those of you who
 would hate the national socialist form of government to keep an open mind
 as you read this. I am just sick of people who just say lame shit like 
 "thats bullshit" and nothing else after i leave documented facts. And those
 left wing scum out there who claim i am writing this to brainwash people
 can fuck off. The two party system sucks dick. They are the true enemys of 
 the american people and need to be destroyed. All the left wing media has
 tried to do to me for my entire life is brainwash me. That is the medias
 only purpose. Back when i was little, 6th grade in middle school, i was 
 forced to read liberal propoganda mags about how being gay is cool, the
 world will explode in a year because of the rain forests, etc. And for 
 about 2 years i was a flaming liberal. That stopped short after i got a 
 computer. It set my mind free, and people wonder why the US government is
 trying to control the internet now? I have found that the republican party
 is the least of the two evils, at least they don't brainwash children who
 can't defend themselves. Anyway, enpugh politics, on with the article.

 World War I
 -----------
    To really understand the development of National Socialism and World War
 II, you have to go back to the 1910's. Great Britian and France were the 
 world's major industrial powers and while they gradually lost there power
 around the world, germany, austria and america were gaining power. France
 and England began to grow jealous of Germany, and they found the perfect 
 excuse for an attack when austria invaded Serbia after the assasination of
 Archduke Ferdinand by a serbian national. After a few years, Britian and
 France were loosing the war badly. The French army had been almost destroyed
 and several divisions started a civil war. The British army, though in better
 shape, was taking heavy losses. They appealed to america for help. America,
 which was violating its own neutrality already by aiding the allies, joined
 using the sinking of the lusitania as an excuse. The Lusitania was a 
 passenger ship sunk by a german U-boat off Britian. About 118 americans died.
 However, it was later discovered that the lusitania was smuggling weapons
 to france when the ship was recently explored with minisub. 
    At the end of World War 1, the allies forced the germans to sign the
 treaty of Versailles. This treaty forced the germans to pay costs for 
 everything destroyed in the war as well as all of the allied nations war 
 costs. They even had to pay huge sums of money for dead horses. This treaty
 carved Germany up amungst the allies and seperated prussia from germany. 
 This treaty was one of the main causes of the second World War. 
 
 National Socialism
 ------------------
    When the German soldiers returned from the front, they faced greater 
 dangers then they had at the front. Communist street gangs tried to 
 assasinate ex-soldiers and the country was in anarchy. A soldier named 
 Adolf Hitler, who had earned several medals fighting on the front found this
 along with the Versailles Treaty disgusting. He was also angry that the jews
 had supported the allies through loans throughout the war. He fought the
 communists in several bar fights. He was eventually thrown in jail for 
 trying to overthrow the government. There he wrote Mein Kampft. People who
 were sick of what was happening to Germany started to support him as his
 fame spread. General Von Schleicher, who was germanys Chancelor at the time
 tried to continue to rule illegally as a Military Dictator. Hindenburg,
 however appointed Adolf Hitler the new Chancelor even in the face of a 
 total military take over by Von Schleicher. The National Socialist party
 had the largest majority in the history of the Reichstag. Thus Hitler was
 legally elected and didn't force Hindenburg into making him chancelor.

 World War II
 ------------
    Once Adolf Hitler was in office, he stopped the retributions to the allies
 and built the german army back up to the strongest army the world has ever 
 seen to retake German territory taken by the allies in the Treaty of 
 Versailes. Austria, the first country invaded, was originally a part of 
 the Holy Roman Empire. The fight between the Hapsburgs of Austria and the
 prussians of the North for control of the Empire caused the Empire to split
 into Germany and Austria. Now that both houses were gone, there was nothing
 to keep them from uniting. Thus, Czechoslavakia and Hungary were also German
 lands. Poland, which wasn't a state till after WW1, violated its agreements
 at versallies by kicking Germans and Jews out of there country into Germany
 (Nuremburg affidavit XVI 275). The polish jews caused many financial scandals
 which rocked Germanys economy (Nuremburg Affidavit XXI 569). The Germans
 originally offered to pay for the return of the city of danzig to the Reich
 and for a highway and Railway through the polish corridor to East Prussia.
 (X 260-269; 280-281; 367-369). In responce, the poles kicked more Germans
 out and mobilized there troops along the german border. The poles 
 underestimated the germans. They though that if there was a war, that 
 Germany would lose because it had been in chaos for so many years, and the
 Polish Army would march through and capture Berlin. (XVII 520-521; 564-566; 
 XX 607). The poles were also demanding parts of East Prussia. (XII 476-479; 
 XIX 224-232; XX 570-571). Germany had enough with this and took it's part
 of Poland back, along with Russia, which took it's share. France and England
 then declared War on Germany, which means they were the agressors. Belguim
 and the Netherlands allowed Allied planes to use there airspace to bomb
 Germany. They German Government protested this over a hundred times. When
 they failed to respond, Germany marched through Belguim, the Netherlands and
 then on to France. When France was completely overrun, Britian was being
 advised by Russia and Frances exiled Government to invade Germany. To try to
 prevent a war, Rudolf Hess flew to England. He was shot down and thrown in
 jail for no reason. The National Socialist hatred of Commies led to the  
 invasion of Russia. FDR, the most Communistic of all presidents, later used 
 the pearl harbor attack by the japs as an excuse to declare war on Germany. 
 Note that in each case, except for Russia, Germany wasn't the aggressor. 
 After the war ended, the allies accused Germans of several atrocitys to
 cover there own actions up. A few examples would be waging aggressive warfare,
 the holocaust and they accused the SS of Rapeing and pillaging. Britian 
 blockaded Germany, which is aggresive warfare, yet they never defined what
 the germans did, if anything. According to military law, any soldier of any
 army type group raped or pillaged was to be executed immediatly (XVIII 368; 
 XXI 390; XXII 78). SS troops were trained to be honorable as well as perfect 
 warriors. And finally...

 The Holocaust
 -------------
    The Holocaust was total Bull shit. There is NO evidence at all that it 
 happened, yet there is lots of evidence it didn't. Most of these holocaust
 survivor writers are a bunch of Racist jews who's story changes daily and
 a few have talked about being freinds with other famous holocaust survivors
 who later turned out to be ghost names for fiction authors. In most of these
 books they also talk about hating the germans as a race, for example Ellie
 Wiesle's book "Legends of our time". No gas chambers were ever found in the
 camps, nor any facilitys that were able to burn, freeze, electrocute, bake,
 etc. The vast majority of concentration camp prisoners were Common Criminals
 (XVII 535-536; XXI 516-521; 607-614). Today, if anyone believes the holocaust
 never happened, they will be immediatly laughed at and made fun off. Why?
 because the jews control EVERY tv network, and are in charge of the news 
 which is the biggest spreader of propoganda in the world. They have spread
 rumors through media about how jews are smarter than normal people. There 
 own religion says they are gods chosen people and will rule over the world
 for about 4 years before "judgement day". The majority of skinheads i have
 met also happen to be extremely intelligent people, despite the media's
 steriotype of nazis being shaved gorillas. The jews lately have been whining 
 about how Farakahn of the Nation of Islam is a racist because he started 
 talking about killing jewboy instead of just whitey. Notice, that he WASN'T 
 a racist when he was just bashing whites. Notice also, that the Jewish 
 religion FUNDED farakahn when he was just bashing whites. The Nuremburg 
 trials to punish all the evil nazi war criminals were a total and complete
 miscarriage of justice. The defence had over 300,000 avidavits and 120 
 witnesses and the prosecution beat all of it with 9, count them 9 avidavits.
 It was more of a "kill a few people to act righteous" trial. Some of these
 people such as Rudolf Hess, were jailed for trying to make peace between
 Germany and the allies. Yeah, jews don't got any power. No.

 Myths
 -----
    Since WW2, the nazis have been the scapegoat for everything evil in our
 society. Several myths emerged, and i will explain the reality of them

   Nazis made human soap and Jackets out of Skin
   ---------------------------------------------
    The Human soap and jackets lie came from the Russians who claim to have
  the soap at the peace palace at Haque. They have never forensically tested
  it and even after the cold war, they won't allow anyone to test it. The 
  jackets and clothes were never found. How the fuck do you make soap out of
  humans? Human skin is to brittle and too thin to be used in making any 
  clothes. Anyways, why would these "racist" nazis use products made out of 
  an "inferior" race?

   German Citizens were beaten and killed during WW2
   -------------------------------------------------
    This one is another one spread by movies mainly. Unfortunently, Americans
  believe what they watch too much. The National Socialist party brought 
  there nation out of a depression larger than any this country has faced
  to becoming the most powerful nation in the history of the world. If they
  were being oppressed, than why did english ambassators to germany claim the
  people were happier than they were in years.

    This part is boring the hell out of me and i have a deadline so i'll 
 continue.

        This particular list appeared on alt.drugs a while ago, and I though
some of you that may have missed it might be interested...

So you're sick of the "War on Drugs"?  Here's an international
list of over 200 organisations which support drug law reform, 
although most of them are in the US.  Look for one in your area.  

Please distribute this list widely, and send in any groups 
which are not listed already.

There's an active group here for almost any taste.  Joining
your favourite organisation is best, though if you're worried
about persecution, just send anonymous money or a letter of
appreciation.  Take advantage of your democratic rights while
you still have some!

If you're already in a law reform organisation, you can use
this list to contact others with similar interests, and share
information or facilities.  Just knowing that there are others
working on these issues can be a big morale booster.  

The power of pro-liberty organisations can be multiplied many
times by fast and efficient communication, which spreads news
and promotes co-ordinated action.  Electronic mail and 
conferencing is the most efficient way to achieve these necessary
abilities.  For example, this list doubled its size in eight
months of circulation over the Usenet.  I strongly encourage
active groups and individuals to use this powerful technology.

This listing was originally kicked off with a list of groups
reproduced _with permission_ from the February, 1992 issue of
_High Times_ magazine (contact details at the end of the list).

Since then, it has grown considerably through the kindness of
those who have contributed additional entries, including Chris 
Klausmeier, Macca Macpherson and Dave Thomson.  Please reproduce
and distribute widely with this acknowledgment.  Post it on 
bulletin boards if you can.

               PLEASE SEND NEW LISTINGS

I don't know any more about most of these groups, than what
appears here.  If you know about other active groups not
listed here, or if any entries need correction, please e-mail
me at "aldis@kralizec.zeta.org.au" or "aldis@peg.apc.org",
or mail to the address below, for incorporation in future
editions of this list.
