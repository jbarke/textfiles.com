        Hello all, back with another installment in the fine VaS series. So
how many of you have had that annoying problem of wanting to kill someone,
but you are too much of a pussy to shoot them or stab them, or if you want to
take out a few people at once? Well have I got the solution to your problem!
Its called the Long-Range Explosive Anti-Person Missle, and here's what you
will need to make it:

     1 small container of small shotgun shot <Available from a gun shop>
     1 small container of gunpowder <Available from a gun shop>
     1 package of multi-stage model rocket engines
     1 package of model rocket ignitors
     1 model rocket kit <Large enough to take E size model rocket engines>
     1 X-Acto knife <or any other sharp knife>
     1 Model Rocket Launching Pad <Or 1/8" 2' long metal or wood dowel rod>

        And know here is how it is going to look when you are finished:

        Basically, the whole secret behind this project is that the normal
rocket engine you are supposed to put on top has a clay top instead of an
open top. When it has a clay top, it just pops the clay out and pops out the
parachute that is supposed to be there. The multi-stage works because there
is no clay top, so it just ignites the next rocket above it. Well when it
gets to the end of the second stage, it tries to ignite a third stage, but
instead it will catch the gunpowder (a fast burning grade is suggested) and
then sends litle metal balls shooting everywhere.
        You need some basic understanding of model rocketry to get this to
work just right, but after a little practice, and using 2 'E' size engines,
you should be able to take out a group of schoolkids from over a mile away
<careful aim and consideration of wind direction & speed helps>. If you want
a somewhat CLOSER shot, you can scale it down all they way to a singe AA
engine <although this will only go around 30 feet, hardly safe for you>, and
use your handly x-acto knife to scrape away the clay top of the engine until
you get down to the black fuel part.
        Anyhow, good luck with your new-found knowledge, I hope you kill lots
of people your first time out!
