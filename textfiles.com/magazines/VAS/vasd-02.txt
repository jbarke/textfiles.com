        Well, we made it this far folks! Special thanks to Boo-Ya MaN and
SToNE CoLD for coming through in a pinch to make issue #1 possible. Well we
here at VaS would like to know how you like the new format after reading the
first issue, and this one. I like this way better, we get them coming out on
a schedule somewhat, and they are a bit more interesting to read as there is
more variety.
        You also may have noticed lots more internet stuff in the "new" vAs,
this will continue, and if you have a good knowledge of internet, and wish
to submit a "Internet Tip Of The Week", let me know somehow and I'll be glad
to put it in.
        Anyhow there are some things from the first issue here, and some new
features as well, so enjoy the magazine!

One of the popular pranks on my floor is called the waterfall, or the flood.
What you do is you take your average dorm garbage can, empty it out, and fill
it about half way with water.  Then you lean it at a good angle outside your
victims door (usually about halfway).  Once you have it balanced, you pound on
the door and run like hell.  Basically what happens is, they open the door and
get soaked.  We have gotten people so good that they have had a puddle in their
room for days. 	You could also do a combination prank.  First penny the door
shut. Then fill up an envelope with shaving cream.  Have the bucket of water
ready against the door. This works best when the people are asleep.  Then call
them up on the phone.  Make sure you wake them up.   When they get to the door
and try to open it, they will  find that they are unable to open the door.
While they are struggling with the door, stick the open end of the envelope
under the door.  When they are right by the door, stomp on the envelope.  The
shaving cream will go all over them and the room.  After this it would be a
good idea to leave.  Once they get the door open, they will be hit with niagra
falls.

        Ma-bell blows.  Its as simple as that. These fucking criminal bastards
rip us off Hard Core, Especially the muther fuckers at Pacific Bell.  An
example of how retarded these fools are: It costs less to call fucking TEXAS
then it does to call another califorina Area Code, such as 619.  How anybody
could stand this type of bullshit is Beyond me.  Welps, in this Issue of vAs
I will Describe the proper method of taking down an Office, Switching Station
or what ever.

        First off, Some things you will Need: GLOVES! THese are the
Most IMPORTANT item in anyones Repretoire(Ooh SnazZy VocabUlaRy).  Get
a GOOD pair, Not some cheap pieces of Tiwainese filth made out
of Wombat hide, but a Nice pair of Leathers. You Will Also Need a
vehicle(NO, not your Valterra Skateboard, duh), Mini-Vans, or a Full
size Van being best, but any car will do in a pinch.  A Crowbar, or
wreaking bar, Screwdirvers, Both Philips and Flat head. An Old Flannel
Shirt, or another Rag, Needle Nose Pliers, and Wire Cutters.  I also
Suggest you take along a pair of bolt Cutters, 18' perferably, and a
slim jim, if you have access to one, but this is by no means Nessecary.

        Next You'll need a Plan.  Most bell offices in MY area Have a
group of Three port-o Buildings, and a Switching Office.  The Port-o
Buildings usually don't have alarm systems, But I have ran into a couple
that did so be sure and check, around windows and doors.  There are Two
ways into these cheap buildings, One being through the Door, using the
Wrecking Bar (FORCE iT), or unless you are a Mondo-L0ckpicking stud,
this is the best method.  I've Personally tried Credit cards, but we had
to fuck with them for too Long before they would open, providing a greater
chance for us to be spotted.  Have one Man on Look Out, While Two of You
Force the Door, and GRAB all the Good shit, Ie. Fax Machines, Computer
Equipment, KEYS!, and Handsets, etc. this should take less than 5 minutes.
BE QUICK!

        The Second way is through the Window, This is a  Tad quicker, but it
makes allot more noise.  Cover the End of the Bar with The Flannel, and
Smash away!  ALSO: if you have time, dig though the Desks, You'll get
all sorts of cool info, Passwords, Loops, etc.

         Next, send the Number Three man, The GRUNT(New Dood) to get the
vehicle You, and The Third person, should then bust Into the VANS, or Little
Tow Vehicles, And Steal all the Shit, Or Steal the Vehicle, if you didn't
bring one yourself. NOTE, unless you  have a Slim Jim, Pass the vans
up, cuz those WINDOWS are impossible to BREAK! steal anything of value.

        WHen your bud pulls up in the car, Stick all the shit you ripped
off in it then, CUT the POwer to the airconditioners, so they get a Nasty
Suprise in the morning, and Force the switching  office door open.
Run in there, if you have limited time I.e. you've been there more then
15 minutes, Just take the wrecking bar to the equipment,
and Take the Terminals. If you have time, Take as much
as you can get, again, it should take only 5 minutes. (WARNING:
The Swithcing OFFICE ALWAYS HAS ALARMS!, USE CAUTION!)

        On the Way out of the Office Area, Steal their Mail, You might get
Lucky!

Notes:  Usually, the Front gate isn't locked, even at 2 am, but bring
        the bolt cutters just in case.
        Plan Ahead, Case the joint a week in Advance.
        Make sure the Vehicle Liscense plate is covered.
        If there is a Bell car there, IGNORE it, the vans
        have all the stuff in them.
        LOOK out for Micro terminals, these are the Best things
        they've got.
        Either Keep the shit, or sell it off Under a Fake account.

  And, once again, it's time for my disclaimer: I Claim that all the herein

 'The Photo Card'

Today I saw something that made me wanna puke.  An ad for ShittyBank
aka CitiBank's new Photo Card.  It looks like any other card except
it has a picture of the owner's ugly face on the back. Which Means,
simply, that it'll be harder then ever to Use stolen Cards.  Your
probably saying "who cares?" However if you think about it this News
means two things

        1. Unless You have a good Plastic Surgeon, Soon you
        won't be able to use cards you've snaked from peoples
        mail.
        2. First Person Carding(Where you actually have a Fake
        I.D., which is the EASiEst Method of Credit Card Fraud,
        Sience Phone Operators are begining to be assholes,
        will Be Threatened.

        What Next? Voice Print Scans? Who Knows. Hopefully we can find someway
        around this lame 'technological' breakthrough'.

First off, legally, (C) is NOT copyright.  C with an actual circle around it 
is. Although (C) has never been rejected by a court, don't just use (C), use 
Copyright

Second, when you copyright an image, text, program, etc..., you cannot use a 
handle. You must use your real name. A handle is nothing and has no meaning. 
For example, on NuKE Virus Creation Lab, it is copyrighted NuKE. NuKE doesn't 
mean SHIT. It means my balls are real big haha. I can copy the code from VCL
all I want and if nowhere man gives a shit, fuck him to hell. He didn't use his 
real name or the name of a registered business, so his copyright is 
meaningless. One message posted to Usenet misc.int-property asked if the guy 
changed (virtually rewrote the code) the code and the original code had:

COPYRIGHT DR. X Y Z
YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE MODIFIED VERSIONS BUT YOU MUST HAVE THIS NOTICE INTACT

did he have to include that notice? NO, HE DOESEN'T. Dr X Y Z doesen't mean 
fucking shit. Under law, unless his real registered name was X Y Z, which is 
simply not possible, the person is not responsible to include the notice.

Bascially, here's what you need to do...

Copyright, <YOUR-REAL-NAME>

or 

Copyright, <REAL-REGISTERED-BUSINESS-NAME>

otherwise it's totally meaningless

One note on photographs, ANY photograph you take is AUTOMATICALLY copyrighted. 
The law says that. But it is wise to include your name and a copyright notice 
on a photograph anyways, otherwise the offender could use the plea of innocent
unknowing in court, which could seriously hurt your case against the asshole 
offender. And another thing, the maximum you can recieve for somebody else 
copying your work is $100,000. Mo Money, Mo Money, Mo Money!

All the systems in 313 suck my dick. The lame fucking ops don't know shit about 
running a bbs. First off, they put in about 50 o/l games. Online games suck. If 
you want to play a game, get off your ugly ass and go outside and play 
basketball with those 1st graders you just met. And worse yet, the retarded ops 
put the score files in the bulletins. WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THE SCORES? Why 
have 999 bulletins with scores from 1 different game? And also the ops care if
you say "FUCK YOU STUPID DICK" in a message or something... Well, to the ops
who care, FUCK YOU STUPID DICK. Once I called this faggot bbs in Livonia and
when I posted a message about rape, the sysop was watching and hung it up
right after I typed the word rape. What a fucking faggot. If you stupid
assholes are still in 3rd grade and these words scare or repulse you, go run
some lame PD board, don't even say the word "DUMB". And, i'm not sure if this
is the worst, but some ops run a bbs with hours. If you can't afford to keep
your bbs up from 0:00 to 23:59 then you shouldin't run one at all. You should
sell your mom until you make enough money hahah. But, the worst thing you can 
do to a BBS, is attract PD users. Don't advertise your BBS on PD boards, don't 
do any of that. If you don't know of any real boards to advertise your bbs on, 
you are a lame fucker and shouldin't be reading VAS. When you get lame PD users 
who don't like people like me, the board gets real boring, and unless you let 
the PD users go somewhere else and make a real section for the real people, you 
have a shit sucker system. And almost the worst, some ops won't let you on if 
you give fake information. FUCK THEM. Their board is some lame PD board then. 
If you are so paranoid and you think the FBI or BELL will waste their time 
taking down boards carrying Phrack, you are a wasted lame asshole. And, still 
yet, some dicksucking ops set a bunch of faggot rules. They keep asking all 
this shit and telling you "if you do this, you're gone" and they have this gay 
attitiude "if I don't get 20 posts in the hacking base today, i'm taking it 
down". If you are so protective and you use all you resources for your bbs, you 
are a fucking nerd. Just get some real users, that means advertising your bbs 
outside of your area code!!! Oh mama mia! I can't call outside of my local 
dialing or else I will get a big fone bill! Hahah. It costs $.20 to call a 
board in California and post a message. If you don't have 20 cents, you are 
wasted. And, by now most people know this, d0N't MaKe YouR B0aRD a /<-RaD 
aWeS0ME b0aRD. That kind of typing is for niggers. And one more thing, if you 
are a looser (If you keep getting eaten on the war board and people keep making 
fun of your mother in school and you don't beat the hell outta them) then
don't put up a board. People are going to crash it and you are going to put it
back up like the fucking loozer you are. Don't get a HST DUAL just because you
want to be so /<-RaD you are stupid. If you want a high speed for your board,
get one. Don't make it a big deal "AutoMessage By: FAGGOT SYSOP... Hey, in 5
years we are going high speed! CAN'T WAIT!"  Well, this pretty much covers it,
if anybody in 313 has a life, they will take down their lame asshole board and
go outside, let the sun touch their skin, get some real clothes, learn how to
use a hair brush, find out what a girl looks like without a GIF viewer, see how 
life is without a keyboard...

"InfoTroniX: The FUTURE of Online Communications!" is what they said 2 years 
ago when Infotronix was introduced. Infotronix is a smaller VMB, PBX, and BBS
combined. It is used by various small companies to manage 800 lines. It is few, 
far and wide, since INFOMACHINES, the places that manufactures Infotronix went 
out of business almost 1 year ago. Here's an example of Infotronix:

1-800-999-0022 VMB
1-800-999-0023 BBS
1-800-999-0024 PBX

I do not have phone numbers for any Infotronix services still operating, but at 
one time those 800 numbers were using Infotronix. Infotronix itself runs on a 
Macintosh II-series computer. It can handle up to 6 different callers per node 
(with 3 nodes, VMB, PBX, and a BBS). The Infotronix circut board fits nicely 
info Apple's NuBus slots. So, on the Infotronix PBX, if 3 people were calling, 
that is the limit because they are all making outgoing calls, which counts as 
two callers at once. The special thing about the Infotronix PBX is that it only 
requires 6 normal phone lines. The Infotronix circut board automatically 
handles calls going through. It uses special clarity circutry (actually in a 
seperate box which sits next to the Mac II. This box also houses other parts
of the hardware required for up to 18 total phone lines and has it's own 
microprocessor to handle switching) which filters out certian types of 
line noise and electrical switching interference. The Infotronix BBS is 
somewhat like VAX, and it's hard to tell the difference. It will give you the 
opening message that the operator set and a Username: prompt. The difference 
with Infotronix BBS and Vax is that it gives you unlimited tries and If you get 
it wrong, it gives you a complete diagnostics as to why it didn't work (e.g. if 
the machine had a bad password file, it would display "User Access Verification 
Error --- Machine has error in password file"). The major weakness with the 
Infotronix BBS (for security reasons) is that anyone can get through by using
GUEST as the username and OPERATIONS as the password. This cannot be easily 
changed by the system operator, it is a "required" account and you have to use 
a different accounting program then normal to change or remove it. That is one 
of the worst flaws of the system. The Infotronix BBS looks somewhat like this:

   Welcome to the MAQ Marketing BBS. This system is for use by authorized
   users only.

Username: GUEST
Password: ..........

Welcome to InfoTroniX 2.1 (Number 314-290, MAQ Accounting, Inc)

As you can see, this may be fun to look through. Most systems DO have some type 
of eithernet network set up so you can connect to other machines, the 
1-800-999-0023 had an actual VAX in the network. Another advantage to the
networks are that in the Infotronix network option in the BBS requires that all 
systems have a name made of numbers. All system numbers that work there also 
work under the PBX as extensions. You're asking, what about the VMB? Well the
Infotronix VMB is nothing to cheer about. It's pretty basic, like all of the 
other Infotronix services. It will play an opening message, the menu, and
records all failed password attempts to disk. It shuts down a certian
account for 15 minutes if there are more then 8 failed attempts at that 
account. One special way to identify an Infotronix VMB or PBX is that you hear
a short tone at the beginning of the call, which is somewhat like the tone you
hear when you successfully dial a 0-700-XXX-XXXX call. When you first call the 
Infotronix BBS, you have to press return twice. Also, you can reach the 
Infotronix BBS via the PBX. Simply use extension 199. You will get automatic 
modem tones. (ATDT18009990022,,199). Well, I hope this has helped you. I got 
most of the info from the guy who managed the Infotronix system which I 
mentioned earlier (the same system which does not exist anymore).

        Well this should be a regular feature in VaS, we are going to have a
voting question on LiVE WiRE bbs each week, and results will be posted in here
at the end of each week. This months question:

            "Who Would You Vote For In The Upcoming Election?"

                  George Bush .................. 7.7%
                  Bill Clinton ................ 15.4%
                  David Duke .................. 15.4%
                  Ross Perot .................. 15.4%
                  Donkey Kong ................. 46.2%

        So the winner, if VaS readers were the only ones who showed up, would
be Donkey Kong. Looks like this country is in for a shock, because I have a
secret plan to kill everyone but VaS readers, so Donkey Kong will be president
come election time!

   Well guys, I know I promised an article on MUD's in this issue of 
   VaS Digest, but after looking over the last article I found it to 
   be very incomplete.  I guess a fever of 104 can make a person 
   write some stupid shit<G>.  Too much formula 44 or something.
   Anyway, I've done a bit of research and found some "better" info on 
   the IRC.  MUD's will have to wait an issue or two.  

   INTERNET RELAY CHAT

   This document attempts to explain, in simple terms, what IRC is and 
   in general, how it is used. It is intended to supply information for 
   new users not familiar with IRC and to serve as a reference for 
   experienced users.
   
   Since there are many different programs on several different operating 
   systems, client-specific information has been left out. Users should 
   refer to the documentation that came with their IRC program for 
   information specific to using that client. Users may also wish to read 
   the author's document "Standard IRC Commands" for information about the 
   commands mentioned in this document.

   
   I. HISTORY
   
        Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was originally written by Jarkko
   Oikarinen <jto@tolsun.oulu.fi> in 1988 as a replacement for the
   Unix "Talk" program.  It's purpose is to allow multiple users to
   converse in real-time over the collection of networks known as
   Internet.  It is based on the functionality of the Bitnet Relay
   system but that functionality has been greatly expanded.
        From it's humble beginnings in Finland, IRC grew to become
   the largest international, relayed conferencing system in the
   world.  It is available in over 20 countries around the world and
   has been host to over 800 users at one time!  Countless thousands
   of people, from college students to business executives have used
   IRC and new users sign-on every day.
        The Internet is primarily for academic use.  IRC is a
   communications layer of internet, and as such, it's main purpose
   is academic use.  IRC is NOT a toy.  Many people depend on it as
   a tool for exchanging information with colleagues, business
   associates, and fellow researchers.
   
   II. CHANNELS
   
        IRC is divided up into virtual spaces called channels.  A
   channel is a gathering place where people with a common interest
   can get together and discuss whatever that interest may be.  A
   channel does not exist until someone joins it and ceases to
   exist when the last person leaves it.
   
   A. Channel Names
   
        All channels on IRC have names.  A channel name can be just
   about any single "word" of text preceded by a pound sign (#).
   For example, #123, #My_channel, and #$$$ are all valid channel
   names.  Examples of popular channels on IRC include #hottub,
   #initgame, and #hotsex.
   
   B. Creating A Channel
   
        To create a channel, simply join it either with the /join
   or /channel command.  For example, to create the channel #Test
   you would type /join #Test.
   
   C. Leaving A Channel
   
        To leave a channel, issue the /part command.  For example,
   to leave #Test you would type /part #Test.  Some clients will
   automatically issue /part for you if you use the /channel
   command, so check your program's documentation.
   
   D. Multiple Channels
   
        Most IRC client programs allow you to be on several channels
   at once.  Check your client's documentation for specific
   information on using multiple channels.  Also, look for
   information on the /, /msg, and /query commands.
   
   E. Channel Operators
   
        The first person to join a channel is known as the Channel
   Operator (ChanOp) and can determine certain aspects of the
   channel, such as the number of people allowed on the channel and
   whether the channel is public, private, secret, or invite-only.
   A ChanOp can also delegate ChanOp privileges to other users on
   the channel.  Look for information on the /mode command for
   specifics about channel modes and ChanOp powers.
   
   III. NICKNAMES
   
        All IRC users are identified by unique nicknames.  Duplicate
   nicknames are not allowed by the IRC servers.
   
   A. Changing Nicknames
   
        By default your nickname is your userid, but may be changed
   with the /nick command.  Many clients also allow you to specify a
   default nickname that will be used whenever you sign-on to IRC.
   Check your client's documentation for specifics about setting a
   default nickname.
   
   B. Nickserv
   
        Many people register their nicknames with an on-line service
   called Nickserv.  If you choose a nickname that is registered to
   someone else, you will get a message from Nickserv telling you
   who it is registered to.  If you get such a message, pick a new
   nickname.  It is considered very rude to use someone else's
   nickname and may cause confusion when other users mistake you for
   their friend.
        For nickname registration information type the command
   /msg nickserv@service.de help.  When you register a nickname,
   Nickserv will ask you for a password. DO NOT USE YOUR LOGIN
   PASSWORD.  IRC protocols are not completely secure and other
   users may be able to get your Nickserv password.  Also, REMEMBER
   YOUR NICKSERV PASSWORD.  You may need it if you ever want to
   change your registered nickname or add a new host site to your
   access list.
   
   IV.  IRC OPERATORS
   
        The IRC Operators (IRCOps) are the people who maintain IRC.
   They keep the servers running and up to date, keep the links
   connected and routed properly, they answer questions from the
   users, and they remove offensive users by way of the /kill
   command.  IRCOps are indicated by an asterisk (*) next to their
   nickname in /who and by the line "<nick> has a connection to the
   Twilight Zone." in /whois.
        The best way to get help or information from IRCOps is to
   join the IRCOp channel #Twilight_zone.  Once you are on the
   channel, state your problem or question in a brief, specific,
   polite manner and wait for a reply.  Usually you'll get a
   response within a few minutes, but since many of the IRCOps have
   responsibilities apart from IRC, they aren't always immediately
   available.  If you don't get a reply in a reasonable amount of
   time, try again later.
   
   V. MESSAGES
   
        There are generally four types of messages you will see
   while using IRC.  The four types are informational messages,
   public messages, private messages, and notices.  Some clients may
   also have a fifth type that gives information about things
   happening within the program, such as when you add a user to the
   /ignore list, but these messages are not normally sent over IRC.
   
   A. Informational messages.
   
        Informational messages let you know something in the IRC
   environment has changed.  When someone joins or leaves your
   channel, changes the channel mode or topic, changes their
   nickname, or makes some other such change you will see a message
   informing you of the change.  The format of the message may vary
   depending on what client you are running, but in general it will
   look something like the following:
   
   *** Bub joins channel #hottub
   *** Mode change: Hoser sets #hottub +o Bub
   
   B. Public Messages.
   
        Public messages are seen by everyone on the channel.
   Everything you type to a channel shows up as a public message
   with your nickname and the channel name displayed in angle
   brackets before the message.  A public message looks like the
   following:
   
   <Bub:#hottub> Hello world!
   
   C. Private Messages.
   
        Private messages are generally only seen by the person who
   they are sent to.  The /msg and /query commands are used to send
   private messages.  Private messages are displayed with the
   sender's nickname between asterisks.  A private message would
   look like the following:
   
   *Bub* Thanks for Opping me, Hoser.
   
   D. Notices
   
        Any automatic response, such as server messages, CTCP
   (client to client protocol) replies, and robot replies MUST be in
   the form of a notice.  Users can also send notices with the
   /notice command, but this is not generally necessary.  A notice
   will generally be shown with the sender's nickname and channel
   between dashes and might look like the following:
   
   -Bubserv:#hottub- Bub sends a beer to Hoser.
   -Bubserv:#hottub- /msg Bubserv help  for help on using Bubserv.
   
   VI. SERVERS
   
        IRC servers are programs that relay the messages and
   commands that you type to other servers and users on the network.
   When you first compile or use an IRC program, you will probably
   have to give it a server to use.  You should normally use the
   closest (network-wise) server to you.  However, some servers
   limit what hosts are allowed to connect to them.
        Lists of servers are frequently posted in the Usenet news
   group alt.irc.  If you don't have access to that group and can't
   find a server, try one of the following servers and once you get
   on, ask an IRCOp which server in your area you should use.
   
   Open servers by country:
        Australia:    coombs.anu.edu.au
        Canada:       ug.cs.dal.ca
        Finland:      nic.funet.fi
        Germany:      irc.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
        Netherlands:  fysak.fys.ruu.nl
        U.S.A.:       csd.bu.edu
                      ucsu.colorado.edu
                      dood.cheme.cmu.edu 6667
        
        Information about a specific server can be obtained by using
   the /admin, /info, /motd, and /version commands.  If you have a
   problem with a particular server the /admin command will give you
   the email address of the person(s) in charge of it.  The other
   commands give you information about the server itself, such as
   the software version and the MOTD (Message of the Day).
   
   VII. BEHAVIOR AND ETIQUETTE
   
   
   A. Language
   
        English is the most widely spoken language on IRC but it is
   not the only language.  Often the channel name or topic will give
   you some idea of the language spoken on that channel but this is
   not always the case.  The end of a user's hostname usually gives
   an indication of where that user is from and thus, the language
   he or she is likely to speak.  For example, someone whose
   user@host name ends in .jp is most likely speaks Japanese, whereas
   someone whose user@host name ends in .fi most likely speaks
   Finnish.  A list of common hostname endings by country is shown
   below.  The list is by no means complete, but it should give you
   an idea of what to look for.
   
   Country     hostname ending
   Australia:       .au
   Austria:         .at
   Canada:          .ca
   Finland:         .fi
   France:          .fr
   Germany:         .de
   Israel:          .il
   Italy:           .it
   Japan:           .jp
   Mexico:          .mx
   Norway:          .no
   Sweden:          .se
   Switzerland:     .ch
   Taiwan:          .tw
   United Kingdom:  .uk
   U.S.A.:          .com  (Commercial business)
                    .edu  (Educational institution)
                    .gov  (Government organization)
                    .mil  (Military installation)
                    .org  (Non-profit organization)
   
        It is a good idea to do a /who on a channel before you join
   so you can get an idea of what language might be spoken on that
   channel. If the channel consists mostly of people from Finland
   and you don't speak Finnish, you probably won't find the channel
   very interesting.  Also, your own channel name or topic should
   indicate what language is spoken on your channel, especially if
   it is not English.
   
   B. Dumping
   
        Dumping large amounts of text or graphics to a channel or a
   user is considered rude and is not allowed.  It is a waste of
   bandwidth and can cause anyone on a slow modem connection to be
   jammed for several minutes. Also, the text or graphics that you
   find amusing is likely to be quite annoying to other users who
   are trying to carry on a conversation.

        For those of you with internet access who want to find a specific
file, or a group of files, then here is the thing for you. It is a system
that will search all the sites (there are quite a few) and find the files
you need, and give you the location and matching filenames.
        Some Archie sites are as follows :

    archie.rutgers.edu  128.6.18.15   (Rutgers University)
    archie.unl.edu      129.93.1.14   (University of Nebraska in Lincoln)
    archie.ans.net      147.225.1.2   (ANS archie server)
    archie.mcgill.ca    132.206.2.3   (Canada server, original archie site)
    archie.au           139.130.4.6   (Australian server)
    archie.funet.fi     128.214.6.100 (European server in Finland)
    archie.doc.ic.ac.uk 146.169.11.3  (UK/England server)
    archiecs.huji.ac.il 132.65.6.15   (Israel server)

        To access them , telnet to one of them, then for login name type in
"archie" (without quotation marks) and you are in. Now you will be at the
prompt, and type "prog <filespec>". For example, if you wanted to find all
files matching the filespec "fuck*.*" you would type "prog fuck*.*" and it
will search through them all and send you the list. Some titles you may look
at are "digest", "text", and "issue". These will bring forth good results if
you are looking for textfiles. After it finds 1000 matches, or gets through
the database it will give you the list, grab a pen and paper and have fun.

        Well im sure all of you at one point have had a vermin in yer house
that you have managed to capture. I will now tell you how you can have fun
with this vermin scum and make it do mach 3 into a brick wall.
        First of all, go to yer local hobby shop, get some model rocket engines
(try either C or D, if you get E you will never see the rodent again), some
rocket ignitors, some wire, and a 6 volt battery. You will also need duct tape
and the vile vermin. Simply duct tape the rocket engine to the rodent, get
the wire running to a battery, and b00m you are all set with monty pythons
flying rodent. You can make ramps, obsticle courses, or just kinda give him
some nice pavement burns as he skids across the street at mach 3 (yes we have
broken land speed records here with this fLyinG RoD3nT).

        Wow, this issue is quite large. Thanks to all for their participation,
if we can keep the good work up vAs will be the best in the whole world. No,
wait, we already are... heh... Anyhow if you want to submit an article, LiVE
WiRE is the place to do it. We would really like to see some more varied
authors here. Anyhow thanks for reading vAs and making it great. Leave yer
questions to me on LiVE WiRE and they may be answered in future issues of vAs,
you may even get your NAME printed in vAs along with all of us gods. Anyhow
later for now... We will return... same time... same place... same vaginal
fluids secreting into your infected sperm bath...
        Also, remember that when you want to get the VaS files, try and call
one of the support sites local to you instead of tying up the HQ with just
downloading the issues. All sites should carry the latest vAs files as well
as complete archives of all previous issues for your enjoyment.
