        Welcome to another issue of VaS digest. I hopefully have enough
authors here to get together a digest on some sort of regular basis as opposed
to the single-issue approach. We still accept submissions (send them to HTS,
the number is at the end of this file) on almost any subject.
        We will be featuring a semi-regular feature by Doom Frog. It will
consist of excepts from the "Book Of Frog", a large compiled group of texts
organized into several different categories. Doom Frog has graciously given
his approval to do this. So be on the lookout for more excerpts from this book
in the near future.
        Anyways, I don't have a whole lot more to say, other then enjoy the
magazine. And be sure to spread the word that VaS is now back in existence for
good.

     Some time ago, I was reading one of those k-rat elite anarchy filez
where it told you how to make your 'own mini nunchakus'. This procedure was
to take a nutcracker and connect the two haves with a little chain. It was
claimed you could use it to fend off guard dogs and so forth as you were
escaping.
     Of course, the author obviously had never tried to fight with such a
pathetic weapon and must have made the file as a joke, because if you tried
to defend oneself against a guard dog with such a weapon, it would eat you
for lunch. I can imagine some p00r Anarchistic Kiddiez who fell for that
one.
    Its especially sad, because nunchakus are in themselves one of the
EASIEST weapons for someone to make.  Why bother with stupid fake ones that
wouldn't work, when you can fabricate your own set cheaply?  So I decided to
write this phile so you could make your own, if you're too cheap to buy a
set (a ok pair costs only 6 bux or so) or are in one of those lame states
like New York where they outlaw them.

You need:
two wooden sticks.  Preferably hardwood. nice round ones are fine.. about
an inch diameter, 8" long for mini chuks, 12" for regular sized one, or
14" for the large sized ones.

Some string. Preferably as strong as you can get it. You don't want the
string snapping as you're strangling someone or twirling it about. About 2
feet of line should be enough. You can buy string cheaply that can hold up a
LOT of weight at most hardware stores. the rope will cost you only about a
buck or so most likely. The sort I used was a nylon line with a 375 pound
breaking strength.
Access to some wood shop equipment, drills, sandpaper, etc. Take wood shop,
or use the one in yer dad's garage.

To Make:
1. Take the two sticks. Drill a hole, wide enough for the string, doubled
over, to get into the stick. Drill it down about a half inch or so into the
wood. Try to get it centered as well as you can on the end.
            -----
           !     !
           !  O  !
           !     !
            -----

2. Next, go down about to where you drilled the hole, and mark a little x,
along side the stick, marking it in the center there of the side. Go down
about 2 inches, put another x there, right in a row with it like so


            --------
            |      |
            |      |
            |  X   |   -lined up with hole on end made in step 1
            |      |
            |      |
            |  X   |
            |      |
            |      |
            |      |
            |      |
            |      |
            |      |
            |      |

3. Now, drill thru the nunchakus, making it the same width as the hole in
the end made in step 1, so the string can go thru it easilly.
Now, carve, saw, or chisel down along between the two holes in the side,
till you have a groove there, but don't make the wood in the middle too
thin. Leave about 1/2" of wood about. The string should be able to fit
nicely around it without having to bulk up on the outside of the nunchakus.

4. Now, properly sand it. Make sure its not all splintery or something,
so it won't fray your rope. paint it or stain it and wax it or whatever you
want. I prefer a nice natural finish, but black is also nice.

The End product should look like this:
                                                                _____
                                                              /  ___  \
                                                            /!   ! !   !
                                                          /  !   ---   !

                                              /    /   /-/   /
                                            /    /    --   /
                                          /    /         /
                                        /    /         /
                                      /    /         /
                                    /    /         /
                                  /    /         /
                                /    /         /
                              /    /         /
                            /    /         /
                          /    /         /
                        /    /         /
                      /    /         /
                      !  /         /
                      !/         /
                      ---------/

To attach the string:
Feed the end in half, loop it thru the end of the nunchaku, and out the
other side, and slip the rope thru it. LIke so:
                                   //
                             --\  //
                          /=|=====    <-rope, threaded thru loop
                         // |  |
                        //   \ /
                      __\\   //__
                     !##\ \ ///##!
                     !___!!!!!___!
                         //  \\           (Note, this is a cutaway view)
                       ||-----||
                       ||!###!||
                       ||!###!||
                       ||-----||
                        \\===//
                      ------------
                     !###########!
                     !###########!

     Do this on both ends. Of course,  the one where you have to tie
the knot should be last. :-) (because you hafta form the loop on the last
one after moving the rope thru it.) You'll understand when you try to do the
second one why.

Note, you can also make a 'three part staff' if you want, by making 2
nunchakus like this, and making a third one with the holes for the string on
both ends of it and tieing all three together.

SHOP TIP:
     Obviously, your wood shop teacher might get a tad grumpy if he
recognized you were making a set of nunchakus. Therefore, THIS is what we
did. You're not making a set of nunchaku. You're making a 'wooden wind chime'.
Simply make 5, or 6 nunchaku ends. Then take a dowel rod, and tie them to
it, and place a hook in the middle of the top part of the
rod like so:              _
                         ! !
                           !
              --------------------------
              --------------------------
                !  !   !    !    !     !
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #
                #  #   #    #    #     #

                They will make a decent clunking sound when blown in the
breeze. After recieving your A, cut them offa the lame chime setup, and tie
them together regularly. I suggest selling the extras to your friendz and
using the money for pizza. :-)

        Hey all you fellow /<-]<0oL el33t d00dZ out there... I'm here to teach
you some new awesome rad hacking tricks. Tired of making blue boxes and
going to jail? Try something New:

        THE LLAMA BOX
        -------------

        This is the granddaddy of all boxes. The big kahuna. Its big. With
this box you can take over the entire cities phone service! How KewL, eh?
(eh? take off, hoser) And its really simple to make provided you have
crosstraining in zoological stuides and computer hacking. The parts you need
are these: 2 Alligator clips(small).
           2 Alligator Clips(The size of booster cable clips)
           5 feet phone cord
           1 Phone
           1 Llama (Must have RS-232 Inferface)

        Ok, eh? This is like really easy to do, eh? First you find your phone
box, eh? And you grab your 7/16" ratchet to open it up, eh? Now you have to
strip the cord, eh? Attach the alligator clips to the red and the green wires,
eh? Now you match the red and the green to the red and the green in the box
and clip them on. Now you have the 2 other BIG ASS alligator clips on the same
wires on the other side of the cord. Take these 2 BIG ASS alligator clips and
clamp them on the llamas gnads. He will of course, immediately stomp you but
then he would go out and have a llama frenzy and all the wild llamas here in
michigan would stampede the city, destroying all the phone lines and buldings
in the process. Now, you just get 2 cups and some  string, and start a phone
company. What competition will you have? hahaha.. Hope you enjoy using the
Llama box, be on the lookout for the Orangutang Box and the Field Mouse Box.

        Hey d00dz: Here are some /<raDiCaL ]<0DeZ we just hacked out fresh the
other day off MCI. You can use these numbers to make free phone calls:

                          1-800-265-5328
                          1-800-673-7286
                          1-800-342-5288

        If You get any more newer k00dez call our ]<odeLinE VBM at
1-800-222-3334. We alWaYS nEEd M0Re K0]>ezzZZ !!!11!1!11!!!11!!!1

        And now for the new improved VaS way to completely sieze the trunk in
your area... Go to your nearest neighborhood African Wildlife preserve. Look
for a big grey fat thing moving around. See that big thing hanging off his
face? Run and jump and grab onto it for dear life. Congradulations, you have
successfully seized the local area trunk.

        For all of you who want to learn how to hack unix systems... Here is
the latest VaS-approved method. Go and get a copy of unix on the little
plastic 3.5" floppies (not the floppier ones- they arent as easy to hack into
peices). Now take your african headhunter cranium removal tool, and
persistently hack on the 3.5" floppies of unix. When total devestation of the
disks has been completed, congradulations - you have successfully hacked unix.

        I really hope you enjoyed these phine hacking tips as a tribute to all
who think that VaS has anything to do with hacking or phreaking or any other
such activities.

         Jews produce nothing, they merely create parasitic industries to
leach off of the physical labors of those they so arrogantly feel are inferior
to them.The jew claims he is a member of a race largely so those who voice
opposition to his evil cult philosophies will shy away from attention for fear
of being branded a bigot. The truth is that Jews come in all colors.Judaism is
an evil religion , much like Satanism, not a race. Jews brought the first slaves
to America , so all black liberals can abandon their jew-loving ideals or face
the fact that they are hypocrites.Jews have never been accepted anywhere due to
their refusal to assimilate. From the Sephardic Jews of Spain to the Brooklyn-
born mosque-murderer, Jews have always had to move on somewhere else, much like
the American Jew-imitators: the Mormons.They have intimidated non-Jews into
subservience by claiming that the God of Muslims and Christians has deemed them
to be the chosen people, free to rape plunder and pillage the economies of every
country unfortunate enough to have a Jew population.

LATE BREAKING NEWS!!!:

        Rabbi Schneerson,leader of the Russian transplanted
Lubavitch sect of Hebraity,has just died.The instigator of the Jew-Black
riots in Crown Heights,Brooklyn,NY has died and , contrary to Jewish
religious doctrine , has not risen out of his pine box.This only goes t
o reinforce the falsehood of the Jewish religion.
While the Jews are not the only cult of this type they are clearly the
largest and most dangerous.Gypsies,Mormons,and Jehovah's Witnesses,
while using the same methods , have never sought total economic and
political domination of the world.Jews must be limited in the amount
of influence they possess. They should not posess power in disproportion
to their number in the world's population.Remember who the enemy is at the
voting booth and the checkout counter!!!!!
