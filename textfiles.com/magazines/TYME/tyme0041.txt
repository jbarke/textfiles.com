  Okay, I know about all of us had just about given up on T.Y.M.E.. I know
  it has been a hell of a long time since we have released, but that is
  because i have been having release problems. Here's the story:

  Things are going fine, and we are up to #40. This is the day Power Rat
  decides he will stop carrying T.Y.M.E. on Exodus BBS because him and I got
  into a big arguement. (Thank god it's over, though) I log on on my new
  restricted access, and here i see ANOTHER T.Y.M.E. #38 entitled "Sticking
  Together" by S0l0mn. This pisses me off, so I download the file and
  read it. In the file, S0l0mn mentions the fact that Power Rat did the
  spelling and grammer in his file. Which could have only meant he gave
  it the wrong release number. I know this is sounding like a load of
  worthless crap, but I just want to clarify things. I had to do some
  switching around, and some renaming, but here is the definate offical
  T.Y.M.E. Issue List (actually, it's about time we had one of these. =] ):

  TYME0041.TXT - We're BACK! (this file)

  And being released along with this file will be:

  TYME0042.TXT - The Strength of Love
  TYME0043.TXT - Chronicles : Chapter ][
  TYME0044.TXT - Chronicles : Chapter ]I[

  And that's about it... The Strength of Love was written by NeuroScrambler,
  formerly Blade, and Chronicles.. well. We all know who takes a lot of
  pride in his work, don't we Krowe? <nudge nudge>

  Well, also, you may have noticed that T.Y.M.E. has taken on a new look. I
  talked to DisordeR again (of F.U.C.K.).. well, actually I talk to him
  quite frequently now, and he is one great guy. He told me what could
  be improved in the releasing of T.Y.M.E. And actually, he is quite correct.
  So we have taken on a new look, a new style of headers and whatnot,
  hopefully a little more asthetically pleasing, as well as a restyled
  footer. These changes will be subtle, but they will show.
  
  And YES, to all you hypocrites, the header was my own damn idea and
  style. =]

  Well, on another note about T.Y.M.E.'s expansion, we are thinking of
  moving outwards into other directions. For instance, we plan to start
  including other things in the releases, such as music, art, and maybe
  ansi. Although I am doubtful about the ansi part, there are already
  way too many ansi groups, with more being formed every day, so I don't
  want T.Y.M.E. falling into the category of "Another fucking art group".
  Any .MOD or .S3M composers out there, send me your work via email on
  any of our local boards, or on the Internet at vyrus@community.net.
  I get on there almost every day, the only exceptions being weekends.
  
  Or, if you catch me dumpster diving, beige boxing someones house, or
  waiting for an operator to call back a payphone for a meetme conf,
  feel free to stop me and say hi. I can always take a little time off
  to say "Hey" or "Whats up" or "Don't touch that wire, you might get
  sh..<BZZZT>".... uhh. Yeah. Anyway, you catch my drift, and T.Y.M.E.
  is roughly eight months old, and we are still going, so here's hoping
  for a great '95!
