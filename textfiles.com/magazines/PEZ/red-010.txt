   Ahh!  We turn the big one-oh!  Quite a milestone.  Or maybe not.  It's been
going fairly well for everyone here, especially me.  But, being the president
of such an extremely ELiTE group such as ReD, and being the SysOp of the best
board in Pennsylvania (heh), I end up getting a whole lot of stupid mail. 
I've been saving up most of this mail just so one day I could show my kids
what a geek I was.  But, since the file's grown pretty large, I've decided
to release it as a ReD article.  Notice -- if you believe any of this for
even a second, you're a freaking moron.  Except for the letter from Jeremy
Kister, of course.  That's completely real.  Read on, Sparky...

   Guy walks into a bar and orders a drink.  Bartender brings it to him and    
the guy drinks it.  So the guy orders another, only this time it's a double.
Barkeeper pours it and the guy downs it.  This goes on for a while.  Finally,
the guy is so drunk he can barely stand.  The bartender says, "Don't you
think you've had enough?" but the guy demands another drink.  Finally, he
crawls out of the bar, gets in his car, and drives home, totally plastered
out of his mind.  He stumbles into the house and his wife is packing two
suitcases.  "Honey, are we going on a trip?" he slurs, and she says, "No.  I'm
leaving you because of your terrible drinking problem!"  Hey, thank you, thank
you.  You're a great audience.

   I know you have a Volkswagen, and you know a fair amount about them, so I
have a question: I own an '84 Rabbit GTI.  Recently I ejaculated on the
distributor advance.  Can I expect a horsepower loss even though I advanced
the ignition to about six degrees and adjusted the timing accordingly?  Also,
I'm thinking of pissing on my fuel injectors.  Would you recommend this?

   Last night on The Tonight Show, I heard Tony Danza mention that he would be
appearing in a program on something called "CBS".  Is this the mysterious
"other network" I have heard reference to so many times?  Where can I find it?
Is there a special hookup invloved?

   Man, do you think it's just coincidence that the NEA and the DEA sound so
much alike?  No way.  It's because they're both acronyms.  Think about it.

   People say that rodeo clowning is one of the hardest jobs out there, 
because rodeo clowns must not only entertain the crowds but must distract
enraged rodeo animals as well.  In exchange, we are rewarded with awe and
respect.  Okay, fair enough.  But I'd like to point out that hanging off a
truck and picking up pieces of broken glass from the highway using nothing
but your butt cheeks isn't such a goddamn great job either, and all I get is
fifty cents over minumum wage.  Put that in your go-figure file!

   I was watching Mr. Ed today and I noticed that the words did not really

   You write those ReD articles, right?  Well, I am a lonely overweight 
teenager who loves your articles.  My only friends are the people I've met
in its contents -- the funny characters, the strange situations, the people
that you always talk about.  Sure, I guess there's a lot in my lifestyle to
laugh at, and most other kids think I'm pretty strange.  But that's all right,
because I've got my "friends" whom I meet and talk to over and over again.
I also beat off a lot.
