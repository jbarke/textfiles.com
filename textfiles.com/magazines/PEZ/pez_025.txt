 :: note from grand-master supreme; black francis ::
 :: by; you know who, silly! ::
 
        i was going to have a quality interview with ween this issue, but,
 i was called into work at the last moment and wasn't able to attend their
 show.

        life is never easy on frannie street.
        
        anyway; first thing's first, though, baby.  pEz monthly is dead.
        
        again.

        yup.  boo fucking hoo.  i know i've said it all already, but this
 time i mean it.  really.  seriously.  once you finish this issue, there will
 be no more _new_ pEz monthly for you to feast your hungry eyes upon, so, i
 certainly hope you enjoy this chumpie.

        not only is pEz monthly going to dissapear, but so am i, and i'm
 taking my board with me.  yup again.  i've decided that i'm wasting away 
 (what should be) the best years of my life in front of a computer.  it's a
 sad fact, really, but it's not like i can't do anything about it.  so, i'm
 going to surgically remove myself from my computer and venture out into the
 world.  it makes my nipples erect just thinking about it.  now i can 
 concentrate on the more important things in life, like; my social life, my
 girlfriend, my band, etc.  things that make me happy.  yes.  happy.  shiny
 and happy.  but, until then, i will still be the pissed off heathen you have
 all grown to love.  it's a nice happy warm fuzzy kind of love, really.  it's
 the kind of love that festers somewhere near your lower intestine and 
 occasionally gives you diarhea.  yum.
 
        maybe when things slow down, i'll resurface somewhere.  who knows?
        
        speaking of fecal matter;
        
        i guess i really wouldn't feel that way if the whole 'scene' hadn't
 turned to shit on me, but, these things happen.  things have gotten way out
 of hand.  everytime i'm on the irc, something pisses me off to the point
 where i want to kick my monitor in, the local 'scene' is so lame it makes 
 me gag, the ansi 'scene' is laughable, and the 'zine 'scene', well, it's not
 what it used to be.
        
        i thought maybe trying to integrate the ansi and the 'zine 'scenes'
 would be a good idea, but, i was horribly mistaken.

        don't get me wrong.  it's nice to have the 'zine 'scene' widely
 recognized, and the little integration brought along some really rad guys,
 but one bad apple spoils the bunch.  for every rad guy that popped his head
 into the 'zine 'scene', five morons jumped in with him.

        i'm using the word 'scene' way _way_ too much.

        that brings me to all these damned groups that are popping out of
 nowhere.  jesus.  where are they all coming from?  what makes someone think
 they can run their own group?  short history lesson - pEz monthly was 
 actually started because i was turned down by another group.  ironic, i 
 guess.  in a way.  i never really wanted to start my own group.  keep in 
 mind this was way back in, uhm, december of ninety-four.  yup.  that sounds
 about right.  so, that clears me of this fad, but i still feel as if i'm
 contributing to it by running my own 'zine.

        contributor-to-fad-no-more, baby!  i'm through!

        it's a shame, too.  i _know_ that pEz monthly was one of the more
 funny, original, and overall better 'zines out there.  too bad nobody ever
 really caught on except for a few neat guys like bloodshot, asphixia, etc.
 (thanks a whole heap, guys).  now, we have to put up with bullshit like bah.
 well, i won't any longer, but, you still will.  haha!  suffer!

        jesus.  i feel like the ramones.
        
        you know, even some of the wacky kids i've grown to know over the
 modem have turned on me.  how depressing.  i am sad.
        
        i've got angst to spare, baby cakes.

        enough bitching for now.  let's proceed with the final, and what i 
 hope to be the best, issue of pEz monthly.  enjoy.

        side note; this issue is action-packed, let me tell you.  i made it
 extra big and extra humorous!  yes, i did!  i threw a bunch of little 
 personal clippings that i've been collecting through the past couple of 
 months that have stricken me as funny, and i thought it would be nice to 
 share them with your pathetic hinder.  you can thank me later.

        another side note; the only contact i will be keeping with my 'scene'
 buddies will be through my vmb.  feel free to give it a ring if you have
 something important or pointless to say.  whatever floats your boat.

 "word up, frannie.  you just rule like poop, man.  that's all i got to say,
 man.  i just wanted to check out the vmb and leave some bullshit message.
 see what you had to say.  maybe you'd say something about swimming.  who 
 knows?  you don't know who this is, do you?  oh well.  uh.  i'm out of

 ( black francis notes; well, it seems that if you call up my vmb, while 
 you're waiting for my box to load or whatnot, they play some nice 'easy
 listening' type music for you to listen to.  you know; elton john, micheal
 bolton, phil collings, etc.  i've gotten numberous complaints on this, but,
 what can you do?  complain to the system administrator?  deal with it, pink
 boy.  fifteen seconds of whitney houston won't kill you. )
 
 "uhm.  i was going to be nice and leave a message, and then i had to put up
 with about fifteen seconds of a really really shitty elton john song, so i
 decided i wouldn't."

 "<burp>.  <_bbbuuurrrppp_>.  ahh."

 [-----]

 "uh.  hello?  uh.  you said, like, only one person called your voice mail 
 box, and they said that you suck, and that pissed you off.  so, like, i'm
 calling.  uh.  how ya doin'?  uh.  while i was waitin', they made me listen
 to some kind of shitty whitney houston crap or something like that.  uh.  oh
 well.  uh oh oh.  this is, like, liquid death.  so you're in cia?  make me 
 an ansi.  heh.  uh.  thank you."

 [-----]

 "hey.  this is neko, and they put me on hold and i had to listen to micheal
 bolton while they were transferring me to your voice mail box and it was not
 the best thing i've ever thought of.  so, uhm, i guess i'm just gonna die 
 right now, so, goodbye.  i hope just hanging up on this will actually save 
 the message and stuff.  ok."

 [-----]
 
 "whoah.  this is my first time calling this thing, man.  nice message.  uhm,
 this is sinister sheep, man, and, i had something to say about pEz;  i liked
 those.. the rEds with, like, the mentos commercials.  you should do 
 something like that again in pEz.  maybe, like, lays potato chips; why
 can't you just eat one?  or.. uhm.. get your own bag.  i don't know.  "why
 can't you eat just one?" was the only thing in my head right then.  that's
 why you got my little <unintelligeable> there.  <unitelligable> now, you've 
 heard my voice.  woo hoo.  i'm gonna get out of here, man.  see ya."

 [-----]

 ( black francis notes; this is a nice little friendly californian who we
 called up on a cia conference and was more than happy to call up my vmb and
 leave me stupid messages.  i asked her to please make them dirty message, 
 but, hey, you can't win them all. )
 
 "hello, black francis.  i wonder if you're really black, or, if you just
 want to be black.  uhm.  i'm not gonna die.  i'm just nikki, and don't call
 me, 'cause we just got off the phone.  that was nice music, there.  that was
 cool.  uhm.  i'm gonna go now, and i'll call you back later.  bye."

 :: the 7-11 confrontation ::
 :: as experienced by; black francis ::

        i periodically and spontaneously get the sudden urge to stuff my face
 with fattening and health-deteriorating goods.  i recieved one such urge on
 june eighth, ninteen ninety-five, around twelve noon.

        i threw on some jeans, a t-shirt, and sandals, then proceeded to my
 luxurious ninteen seventy-seven volkswagen beetle.  i made the two minute
 drive to the neighborhood 7-11, and anxiously approached the haven of
 sweets.  my mouth watered at the thought of all the beautful chocolates and
 candies and sodas and chips that awaited me inside.
        
        a man in his young teens was exiting the establishment while i made
 my way in.  he was shabbily dressed, sweaty, and by the looks of his pants,
 he had been mowing lawns.

        guy; "nice earring."
        me;  "well, technically, since it's in my nose and not in my ear,
 it's not an earring."
        guy; "<pause> fuck you, you fuckin' freak!"

        .. and with that, he vanished from my life forever.  no goodbye.  no
 nothing.  he didn't even stop to pick a fight with me, like most uptight
 narrow-minded jock fucks would.

        how dissapointing.

        i proceeded to the back of the store, bought my large wild cherry
 slurpee, and drove back home trying to drink it with one hand, operate my 
 manual stick shift, and steer with the other.

        my lips were bright red for the senior prom that evening.

 afraid of the majority.  i doubt the majority reads this 'zine, so I'll
 share my fears with you.
        
        well, number one, i'm afraid of the dark.  i can't stand it.  i can't
 fall asleep at night when the lights are completely out.  i need something
 to be there, to make me feel secure.  i usually have a Pavement album in the 
 stereo, because hearing stephen malkmus's voice at night makes me feel safe.
        
        number two, i'm afraid of women.  i have had only two girlfriends in
 my lifetime, and both have hurt me worse than any physical pain that could
 be inflicted upon me.  this has terrified me of them, i feel like they're 
 all evil because of these two encounters.
        
        number three, i'm afraid of this year's lollapalooza.  i'm afraid
 that pavement will become popular to all the frat boys and dumbshit jocks. 
 i'm afraid of hearing "at&t" or "silence kid" hummed by dipshits.  

        i hope you can relate.

 reading this e'zine and nothing's changing inside of you.  we could be 
 completely cutting you up to bits, and you'd say 'that's lame, d0oD!@' or we 
 could be saying something completely profound that you agree with and then 
 you'd say 'right on, dE\x/d!@'.

        pEz monthly wasn't even about that.  we could care less whether you 
 agreed or not with us.  what pEz monthly _was_ about, was the chance to get 
 your opinion, your voice, and your sarcasm out into the world of 'zines, to 
 be heard.  we wanted to change people.  but you fucked it up, you worthless
 maggot.

        i'm hoppin' and boppin' in a fit.  i'm rootin' tootin' mad and i 
 wanna pee off a bridge on frank sinatra's suit 'cause i'm steaming angry and
 i wanna kick you in the head.  your big stinky head.

        ansi?  don't fucking talk to me about ansi.  you stupid worthless 
 morons that obsess about colored blocks for hours, actually discussing and
 dual-kissing each other's asses over a stupid picture of a ripped comic
 character can die.  die die die.  don't even read this.  you'll never get 
 it.  you suck.  fuck dat.

        lit?  you think a stupid angst poem about mommie and daddie taking 
 away your latest t.v. set is a great tragedy, you suburban rich garbage.  go
 take you're rants about blood and death to some gothic moron that actually is
 at you're pathetic level.  fuck dat.

        warez?  don't even _think_ about mentioning warez.  fuck dat.

        hackers?  when will most of you morons realize that once you learn 
 it, it's basically redundance unbound.  eventually it comes around to the 
 same pathetic point.  fuck dat.

        you chat board losers can die along with everyone else.  only a moron
 like you can spend your entire life aimlessly making stupid flirtatious 
 comments to fat girls and computer geek-guys.  go the hell outside and do 
 something with your worthless doomed life.  you're bad jokes and simplistic
 conversations make me puke.  fuck dat.

        me?  i suck the most.  i'm a moron and a hypocrite to the highest 
 degree.  i curse all the things i do myself.  i'm a loser and fuckhead.  
 kill me now and we'll save us both a lot of suffering.

        yes, i'm in a tissy.  i'm kickin' it overdrive flavah.  maybe we 
 expected too much from a group of nitwits like you.

        you fuckheads recite the word 'lame' like it was the only word you 
 could actually type.  this text file thing that pEz monthly was about 
 something bigger and better than anything _any_ other computer "scene" could
 have produced.  pEz monthly was about all of you _really_ expressing 
 yourself.

        basically, pEz monthly is dead now because of you and only you.
    
        so now you can continue whatever worthless activity you were doing 
 and you'll won't hear a peep out of it again.  i hope you're happy, 
 fuckface.

        it's a maturity thing; you wouldn't understand.

 :: the adventures of billy; the retarded dishboy ::        
 :: episode two; billy has to pee! ::
 :: by; black francis ::        

        it was quite a busy night for billy.  he had never seen so many 
 dishes.  without mercy, buspan after buspan, the waitresses would roll them
 in for billy to take care of.  that's not what bugged him, though.  it was 
 the fact that he had to pee so bad he could feel it way up in his stomach.
        
        "eeh ahh." he would mumble to himself, legs crossed.

        maybe he shouldn't have taken full advantage of that bottemless soda 
 that he had on his lunch break.  maybe.

        his face was getting warmer now.  he felt flushed.  another waitress
 strolled back into the dishroom to deliver another buspan to billy.

        "are you ok, billy?  you don't look so good." she said.  you could
 never really tell if the wait staff was being sincere in their concern for
 billy, or if they were just patronizing him.

        "yah yah eye em uk." he was lying through his teeth.  you could hear
 it in his voice.  he was struggling.  if he could just hold out until things
 slowed down a bit, he could make it to the bathroom and not have to worry
 about a mountain of dishes waiting for him when he came back.

        just a little longer, billy.  just a little longer.

        then, suddenly, the dishwasher sprung a leak.

        billy soon followed.

        billy stopped what he was doing for just a second, sighed, and went
 back for another refill of soda.

        her condition was a rather surly one, one traceably anarchistic, yet 
 one of utter devotion.  there is, after all, nothing so outwardly 
 paradoxical as faith in anarchy as an institution.  needless to say, her 
 natural tendencies engulfed her, poisoning the golden arrow, frying the

 :: the dunkin' donuts confrontation ::
 :: as experienced by; black francis ::

        about a year or so back, my family and i lived in an apartment 
 complex not too far away from the one we live in now.  anyhow, that last
 summer that we were there, a homeless lady moved (so to speak) underneath
 a bridge which bordered the property of the apartment complex.  the local
 kids (myself included) used to bug the living fuck out of her.  we'd throw
 firecrackers at her, dump things on her as we passed overhead, etc.  a few
 times we would walk by the bridge, and, much to our horror, see her 
 completely naked - bathing in the creek.  vulgar, to say the least.
        
        wow.  i'm way off topic now.  anyhow, here's the deal;
        
        in the wee hours of the morn, when bored, i've been known to visit
 the local dunkin' donuts and chill with a vanilla creme and some orange 
 juice.  it helps me think sometimes.  anyway, one particular evening at the
 dunkin' donuts, in walks the homeless lady from under the bridge.

        then fate kicked in.  she walked over and sat down next to me.

        things were silent for a while.  time kind of dragged on like it
 normally does two o'clock in the morning at a dunkin' donuts.  out of 
 nowhere, unprovoked, the lady whispered to me.

        "you know why all the indians run these places that are open 24 hours
 a day?" she asked me, as serious as could be.

        "no.  no i don't."

        "it's so when the iranians come to bomb us, they can bomb everything
 _except_ the stores that still have their lights on, keeping their fellow
 middle easterners safe."

        i sat and thought about that for a few minutes.  it sure sounded like
 a reasonable theory two o'clock in the morning.  so, when i got home, i dug
 through the boxes in my closet and found my bart simpson nightlight.

        forever safe for terrorism i shall be.

        greetings brothers and sisters in our lord jesus nameamen!
        
        i have written you to remind you of the words of our teacher.
        
        we must not stray from his path, lest we fall to the heathens below
 us.

 [-----]
 
 1.  we are the _true_ righteous people of the earth.  god has chosen _us_
     as his people.  if someone who is not of us claims this, we must beat
     the living shit out of that satan-worshiping heathen.

 2.  if they don't think like us, they are not _righteous_.  beat the
     unrighteous shit out of them, too.

 3.  god hates wiggers.  beat 'em.

 4.  god hates faggots.  hang 'em.

 5.  god hates communist-pinko-leftists.  burn 'em.

 6.  god loves us.  _only_ us.

 7.  remember; like so many other things in our great country, god's favor
     can be bought.  soooo, keep that money rolling in, or you'll become a 
     wigger, a faggot, or liberal.

 make our faces shine and our stomachs full.  place a buick in every

        my life is sad.  sad is my life.  is my life sad?  yes.

        whew - my right ear is ringing.  i was on the phone for about two 
 hours with an ex-girlfriend.  i've had two girlfriends in my entire life.  
 both now consider "giving head" as a sport.

        i have bad taste.
        
        actually, i don't really think it's that.  i think it's where i
 live.  i live in smithfield, north carolina.  if the name alone doesn't tell 
 you something, you're blind.  Let's play decipher names for a second, ok?

        smith - most common name in america.  similar to chung/chang
                in china.
        
        field - figure it out yourself.
        
        north carolina - only one thing worse than this, south carolina.
                         i hate the south, i moved here from detroit.

        anyways, a few more fun facts about my town;

        1. we don't have a music store.  (nearest is about 40 miles away)
        
        2. all we really have is a walmart plaza (subway, pic'n'pay shoes)
        
        3. no one in this town has _heard_ of pavement.
      
        what was the point of this?  i want you to feel sorry for me.

 :: nirvana.  whee. ::        
 :: by; silver jew ::
        
        here's something mildly entertaining that i found on the internet;

 [-----]

        dear anyone willing to help;

        i am a freshmen in high school in carroll, iowa.  our school recently 
 made a student in 8th grade wear his "in utero" nirvana t-shirt inside out.
 the guidance counselor claimed the band and shirt were "satanic", she
 also accused the student wearing the shirt of being satanic, although he
 is not.  i'm not saying i'm against satanism, but this is prejiduce (sic)
 and censorship.
 
        the school and police department are debating whether or not to allow
 students to wear nirvana apparel in our school district.  please send me
 any comments or information related to this.  i would like to prove to the
 school that the members of nirvana are not and never were satanic.  please
 respond or e-mail me.
 
                                 thank you,
 
                                 nate smith
                                 lord_nate@netins.net
 
 [-----]

        number one, what the fuck are you doing in iowa, kid?  seriously
 though, that's pretty sad that police and school officials are trying to
 censor something that they don't understand because they're too old.  if i 
 become that narrow-minded when i get older, please shove a hot poker up my 
 ass.  
        
        if i understand correctly, this kid is talking of the nirvana shirt
 with the cover art from "in utero" on it.  i own the shirt, it has the
 cover on the front with "in utero" on the back of the shirt.  there isn't
 anything satanic or obscene on the shirt.

        just shows baby-boomers that are trying to get rid of something they 
 don't understand.

        my god, bob dole has brought the "parents of america" club back to 
 life because of his attack on 2 live crew, nine inch nails, and the movie 
 natural born killers.  this is the same club that outlawed dungeons and
 dragons from california because it was "satanic".  

        fuck these older generations.

 :: the dinner table confrontation ::
 :: as experienced by; black francis ::

        dinner is usually a strange experience at my house.  the food is
 always good, but the atmosphere at the table when the family gets together
 is kind of odd.  we're not a very close-knit clan, and we certainly don't
 have much in common.  this usually makes conversation very awkward and
 the very short time i'm in the kitchen seems to drag on and bumble along.

        "dad and i were going to go to a movie tonight.  do you want to 
 come?" asked my mom.

        "i can't, mom.  i'm going to a concert."  i wasn't lying.  i had been
 waiting for this concert for a while.  although going to the movies with my
 parents at seventeen years old wasn't exactly my idea of a good time, i 
 still would have went with them if i hadn't made previous arrangments.  it's
 still nice to please the folks from time to time by hanging out with them.

        "is it a moshing concert?" she asked.

        "what?  a _moshing_ concert?  uhm.  i really don't think there will
 be moshing there.  no."

        "do you ever do moshing at concerts?"

        "well, yeah.  most of the concerts i go to.  yeah."

        "isn't that dangerous?  what happens when you get moshed?"

        "what?  what are you talking about?  get moshed?  uh.  well, everyone
 usually stops to pick you up and make sure you don't get hurt."

        "that's not what the tv said."

        "do you turn to the tv for all your guidance?  i'm telling you, 
 that's what they do.  i've been to millions of 'moshing' shows."

        "that's not what they said.  they said people get hurt and sometimes
 people get killed.  they get trampled on when they get moshed.  some people
 suffocate.  what is the point of moshing, anyway?"

        "i don't know.  it's a nice way to release stress."

        "what do you do?  slam into each other?  run into each other?  is 
 that what you do?  can you, like, stand up and show us what you do when you
 mosh?"

        "no, mom.  that's ridiculous.  leave me alone."

        "come on.  just show me.  do you ram into people?  do you, like, 
 shove them like (pushes my shoulder) this?  show us.  what do you do?"

        "damnit, mom.  leave me alone, please."

        "will you at least show me?  i don't get it.  i don't see the
 attraction.  can you mosh me for a second so i know what it's like?  i've
 never been moshed.  i've never even seen it."

        "fine, mom.  stand up.  stand over there."

        we both put down our untensils and walked to the far end of the
 kitchen.  she obviously had no clue what slam-dancing was, so, i took upon
 myself to show her.

        i felt bad knocking her to the floor like that, but, she deserved it.

        "is that what you do?  and this is fun?  have you even gotten moshed?
 are you planning on moshing tonight?"

        "shut up already, mom."

        i guess it's a lot funnier when you actually visualize me 
 slam-dancing with my mom in the kitchen and knocking her into the 
 refridgerator.

        ok.  so maybe it's still not funny, what do you want from me?

 :: post-real history ::
 :: submitted by; sweeney erect ::
 :: transcription and very slight editing by; murmur ::

        the history of the earth is not widely regarded to have become truly
 interesting until humanity gave up the idea of reality altogether.  to most 
 intelligent observers, it had been obvious for quite some time that what had 
 previously been regarder as "real" was rapidly becoming obsolete.  on may 
 15, 1996, however, when a pack of hyper-intelligent wolverines invaded the 
 white house, mauled president clinton to death, and subsequently drafted 
 their own health care package, the world at last threw off its last 
 pretenses of logical reality.  (the fact that clinton was still serving in
 1996, which was previously believed to be a sign of armageddon, was thus
 adequately explained as an early result of the collapsing reality.)

        dan rather, while reporting the event, suddenly turned to the camera
 and said, "alright you ignorant sons of bitches, here's the *real* story.  
 in roswell, new mexico, 1947, a ufo crashed.  the aliens brought with them 
 the secrets of utopia.  our government subsequently had them killed.  in
 retaliation, their home planet killed kennedy, popularized disco, and wrote
 the screenplay to hudson hawk.  oh, and nixon isn't really dead either.
 the republicans are keeping him cryogenically frozen and they're gonna thaw
 him out and run him for president."
 
        several cia agents were dispatched to kill rather, but on their way 
 they were distracted by a pick-up basketball game.

        the next morning, people around the world woke up to discover they 
 lived in duluth, minnesota, 1957.  trent reznor, upon discovering his crew 
 cut and closet full of cardigan sweaters, proceeded to write 17 songs, all 
 of which turned out to be "blue suede shoes".

        by mid-afternoon yasser arafat had decided that golda meier (who 
 turned out not to be dead but just a really sound sleeper) was really swell.
 the two began to go steady and israel and her neighbors joined together, 
 renaming themselves "arnold's diner".

        the wolverines' health care package passed, with an amendment 
 sponsored by strom thurmond which made "the freaks come out at night" 
 america's new national anthem.

        somewhere in the california desert, scientists began to defrost 
 nixon's body.

        early the next morning, einstein's brain, long thought missing, 
 turned up at a yard sale in southern montana.  at the same yard sale joe 
 dimaggio's first yankee uniform, a completed manuscript of the mystery of 
 edwin drood and george wallace's wheelchair each sold for a quarter.  the 
 family having the yard sale claimed to have no idea where the items came 
 from.  each time they went into their garage, there was more stuff.  by 
 early afternoon, when gerald ford was found sitting in the corner looking 
 confused, it became apparent that the garage was some sort of black hole for
 semi-uselessartifacts.  ford sold for a dime to a lovely family from western 
 north dakota.

        that night the wolverine family finally relinquished control of the 
 white house.  a large contingency of badgers tried to usurp power but were 
 chased away by a chainsaw-wielding tipper gore.

        there was wide spread dancing in the streets when richard simmons 
 announced he had contracted the ebola virus.

        arnold's diner declared war on jupiter.  later in the day, at the 
 garage in montana, israel's elusive nuclear bomb materialized, as well as 
 nixon's secret plan for ending the vietnam war.

        unfortunately, by early evening the joy caused by the simmons 
 announcement was replaced with pensive terror as richard nixon announced he 
 would once again seek the white house.

        the next day was declared july 4, 1986, because 1) everyone wanted 
 to see fireworks and 2) nobody could distinctly remember being unhappy in 
 1986.

        later that afternoon, at a picnic, snoop doggy dogg and vladimir 
 zhirinovsky were awarded nobel prizes for actuarial origami.  zhirinovsky 
 proceeded to bitchslap snoop.

        viking ships were spotted heading toward northeastern west south 
 carolina and panic broke out in fear this event might cause nixon to rise in
 the polls.  soon after, the viking ships were revealed to be a well 
 disguised flock of geese and excalibur materialized at the garage in 
 montana.

        when the sun rose again there was great weeping and gnashing of 
 teeth, for nixon was leading in the polls.  jesus materialized in the garage
 in montana and launched a presidential campaign.  unfortunately, the senate
 republicans had the day declared good friday and a group of over-zealous
 actors with a penchant for realism crucified him on tv.  only x-files got 
 higher ratings.

        when jesus got back to heaven, he was understandably rather pissed 
 off.  by now it had become apparent that, indeed, richard milhous nixon 
 would be elected president.  as punishment he turned his back on the world,
 but not before granting richard simmons immortality.

        a few years later, during nixon's second term, the big bang 
 materialized in the garage in montana.  a few pennies and a shiny bottle cap
 bought it for little timmy.

        the end.

        haha.  i put so little into this issue it's almost laughable, and, 
 you know what?  it felt fantastic.  it's great being unmotivated sometimes.

        you know what else?  i'm not even motivated enough to write this 
 article.

        so; goodnight, and i hope you die real soon!

        i'm sure i'll be sorely missed.
