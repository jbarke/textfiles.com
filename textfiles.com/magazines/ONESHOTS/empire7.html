				Introduction

      Well it's been a while since the last issue came out, which is good
and bad.  The good news is that we have a real good issue, and the bad news
is that it took longer than we wanted it to take.  There has been a large
response to Empire Times, I guess people want it.  The mailing list has
grown to be bigger than we expected it to be.  I supose we should stay
around.  We will.

      The last issue was somewhat 95% media of hackers.  This issue we have
more technical articles like earlier issues. If anyone would like to join us
in producing empire times, please feel free to email me.


      I've read alot in recent magazines and have seen alot on tv recently
about hackers, and it makes me sick.  I don't think the perceptions are
accurate.  Even though it bothers me, being the laid back individual I am
I don't let it get to me.  Maybe that is my fault, maybe it is good though.

      I want to send out a message to all the covert hackers and phreakers.
Not many people have such talents that some of us have.  Use them wisely, and
think about what you are doing before you do it.  I am not saying hacking is
bad (no no, why would anyone think that?).  I am just saying that think
about what you are doing and how you can get caught.  I don't want people to
get locked up like Mitnick and others.  Watch yourselves.

      I'm going to keep it short and sweet.  This is definatly a period of
busts.  Many many fellow hackers have gone 'down'.  That is something that
most people consider the worst thing that could ever happen to a member of
the computer underground.


	Till the next Empire Times,

                                 DC Dirt #2
                            roach@tmok.res.wpi.edu
                     roach@cult.empire.org  <--- try this one!

     I ran the first article of DC Dirt.  It looks like the coast is clear.
I better say what I want before that huge hacker gang beats me up...

----- Rumor #1  DC Posse?!?!?

Rumor has it there is a new 'Posse' in the DC area.  They call
themselves (oh, take a guess!) 'DC Posse' or 'DC p0sse' or 'DC
p0ss3' or other inane k-rad statements.  The grapevine has told me
these guys are bad.  What the definition of bad is, I don't know.
Blah.  Come on you guys, couldn't you have picked another name?

DC Dirt would-be names for DC Posse/DC p0sse/DC p0ss3:

1) LoD 2 --- The search for Lex Luthor (startrek joke)
2) iCE WaTeR --- We make better ansi's, and goddamn proud of it.
3) The Dream Team 2 --- We will crack 1 - 3 year warez.

Not to put down this 'DC Posse', but really guys, be more original.


----- Rumor #2  DiscoDan's box is clearing out.

DiscoDan has had enough trouble with stupid hackers. Almost being
rm -rf'd,  and UMD on his case has not been a great experience for
him.  He is cleaning out all of his users.

Shit.  The same thing happened with Lgas' box a year ago.
When will people learn not to hack from friend's sites?

----- Rumor #3  Did y-windoze really get busted?

Last issue I said rumor had it that Y-windex was busted.  Now I
hear from sources that no, he wasn't busted.  He just wants you to
think he was busted.

Now Dc Dirt has heard that Y-windoze may have started the rumor
himself.  DC Dirt is confused.  But then, DC Dirt is for rumors,
not real fact.

I talked to Y-windex the other day.  He seems alive and kicking.
He is running out of money, for he doesn't have a new job
yet.  He Better get some if he's going to stay around the
washington area.

----- Rumor #4  Someone is busting unregistered WWiV boards.

Supposedly some ding-dong named Equalizer is turning these boards
in?  Does anyone have specifics on this rumor?  I imagine there are
unregistered WWiV bbs' all over the DC area.  This is really
stupid.

----- Rumor #5   Kewp coming to DC?

Rumor has it, Kewp, who made ISS, or Internet Security 
Scanner, is going to DC 2600 this February.  I also hear the
almighty TK and KL will be there to greet him.  Too bad they
only come around when someone from out-of-state is here.

----- Rumor #6  DC Kamakize is not a Narc.

Maybe since there are two Kamakize's on the IRC, this lead to the
confusion.  But Kamakize told DC Dirt that he never was a fed,
Narc, or anything.  "Just Homeysan and Tiphoid making this shit
up." he is quoted.  DC Dirt has met Kamakize, and doesn't think he
is a Narc either.

----- Rumor #7  SummerCon in the Wind?

DC Dirt has heard that there might be a SummerCon in the DC area.
Everyone was planning for one last year.  But one of the main
reasons it never came to be was because of HOPE.  Other reasons
that did not help were trying to find an Airport, metro, and a
cheap hotels around the DC area.

Maybe someone has finally figured out a plan to put all three
together.  SummerCon in DC would be just kewlin.

Other Names for SummerCon in DC:

BustCon '94 -- the only convention that is in a Federal Building!
FedCon '94  -- Which is the hacker?  Which is the fed?
ParanoidCon '94 --  Not just your regular con...A "DC, FBI, CIA,
                    Police, and any other agency down the road"
                    Con.

They do all seem to have a same theme, don't they?  :)

----- Rumor #8  Just what did BLAH say on the IRC?

DC Dirt was talking to BLAH on the #hack the other day:

*BLAH* yeah I understand, I like the sound of Candlebox though <Wed Nov 23
19:07>
*BLAH* great group to fuck to, you can quote me on that! <Wed
Nov 23>

Oh really, BLAH?

----- Rumor #9  Shadowdancer Busted?

Shadowdancer, a supposed member of the DC p0ss3, was busted.
No, not because he was hacking .mil's or .gov's...he got busted
for hacking UMD.  Ironic, isn't it?

He was "+ +" the .rhosts file of a librarian he knew.  How he
got the librarian to access her account, Shadow Dancer didn't
say.  Librarians beware!  We are going to  hack your accounts!
Bwahahahahahahahaha...

----- Rumor #10  UMD annex is loggin phone numbers.

Thats right UMD hackers, it seems that now our beloved hacker
hangout is now loggin our phone numbers.  Sigh.

atdt 301403XXXX

CONNECT 9600/ARQ/V32/LAPM/V42BIS

will get hung up by UMD.  Looks like you need to try and
find another dialin, folks.

UUCP feed.  So now anyone who is on Empire can read the
Usenet, and have an internet email address at:

	   The Glenayre GL3000 Paging and Voice Retrieval System
				 by armitage
			     (armitage@dhp.com)

				  Welcome
				  -------
    I am glad you decided to read this article.  This article will explain
the basis of what this system is, show many features, and guide you through
a few basic operations (pager reactivation, and meet-me setup).  This system
is one of many different paging systems, but I have found many scattered
through the nation, so if you are wondering what you can do with all those
carriers found while scanning, compare them to the login screen shown later
in the article.

				  Summary
				  -------

    The Glenayre GL3000 paging and voice retrieval system is a fully featured
digital radio paging terminal which also provides integrated voice mailbox
facilities.

    I'm sure this is not important, but so you know, the gl3000 family comes
in 5 different respective sizes (es, s, m, l, and xl).  All of the systems
have same features except the only thing that differs is their bandwith, and
their capibilities.

    Analog and digital paging formats are supported, it provides for tone only,
voice, numeric, and alphanumeric paging.

				  Features
				  --------
Voice Mail Box Features
-----------------------

    The voice mail box feature of the system complements the pager router
system very nicely.  This voice mail system is just like any other, so I 
won't go into detail over it.

Glossary of Terms
-----------------

    I have listed some terms you might have trouble with while you are
playing around with this system, this is nowhere near as many as there are,
but the most vital are listed below.

Address - 1. The telephone number dialed by a calling party which identifies
	 the party called.  2. A location or destination in a computer
	 program.
Bell 103 - The North American standard for 300 bps modems.
Bell 212A - The North American standard for 1200 bps modems.
Blocking - The process of grouping data into transmission blocks. The
	 inability of a pabx to service connection requests, usually because
	 its switching matrix can only handle a limited number of connections
	 simultaneously.  Blocking occurs if a call request from a user
	 cannot be handled due to an insufficient number of paths through the
	 switching matrix; blocking thus prevents free stations from
	 communicating.
Borscht - Acronym for the functions that must be performed in the Central
	 office at the subscriber's analog interface of a digital system.
	 (battery, overvoltage, ringing, supervision, coding, hybird, and
	 test)
Broadband - A communication system with a large bandwidth.
Channel - Electronic communications path, usually of 4,000 Hz (voice)
	 bandwidth.
Crossbar - A type of telephone switch.
Crossbar Switch - (In PABX technology) a switch that has multiple vertical
	 paths, multiple horizontal paths, and electromagnetically operated
	 mechanical means for connecting any vertical path with any
	 horizontal path.  Modern PABXs often use an electronic version of
	 the crossbar switch.
Data - In phone systems: any information other than speech or tones.
Data Set - The telephone companies term for a modem.
Decoder - A device that converts information into another form of signals.
	 (A DTMF decoder converts dtmf tones to numerican dtmf values)
Dial Long Line - Special Service device which extends loop signalling
	 distance.
Digital - Variable as opposed to constant.  Data characters are coded in
	 discrete, seperate pulses or signal levels.  Contrast with Analog.
Duplex - Simultaneous two-way independant transmissions in both directions.
Echo - A faint return of transmitted data.
ESS - (Electronic Switching System): A telephone switching machine using
	 electronics, often combined with electro-mechanical crosspoints,
	 and usually with a stored program computer as the control element.
FCC - (Federal Communications Commision): A government agency that monitors
	 and regulates all use of the electromagnetic spectrum for
	 communications.
Handshake, Handshaking - A preliminary process that is part of a
	 communications protocal that establishes a data connection.
Interface - The connection between two seperate and distinct mechanical or
	 computerized systems.
Interoffice Trunks - Shared facilities connecting CO switches.
Link - A communications circuit.
Local CO - Central office (end office) capable of switching calls between
	 local subscriber circuits.
Local Loop - The voice-band channel connecting the subscriber to the central
	 office.
Logging - Recording data associated with a system.
Multiplexing - The division of a transmission facility into two or more
	 channels.
Network - An interconnection of copmuter systems, terminals, or data
	 communications facilities.
Parameters - Selectible variables designed for system uses.
Port - A computer interface capable of attaching a communication protocol.
PBX or PABX - (Private <Automatic> Branch Exchange) A system providing
	 switching in an office or building.
Voice PABX - Voice only PABX for voice circuits.

                       Nokia Cellular NAM Programming
                                by Dr. Freeze


FOR AUTHORIZED DEALER USE ONLY

NOKIA 100 SERIES CELLULAR HANDPORTABLE TELEPHONE
NAM PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTIONS

The Nokia 100, 105 Series handportable CMT uses an EEPROM NAM that can be
programmed directly from the standard user keypad.  In order to access the
NAM, you must enter the special access code currently programmed into the
phone.  Once the programming mode is accessed, NAM parameters are loaded by
entering them into the display and "storing" them to selected memory
locations.  Be sure to obtain all parameters before proceeding.

ACCESS NAM PROGRAMMING MODE:

1.  Turn the phone on.  (DUH!)
2.  Enter the NAM access code.  The factory default is: *3001#12345
3.  Enter [STO] 00.
4.  Verify that "STORE NOT DONE" appears in the display.  If "NOT ALLOWED"
    appears, check to see if you have entered the access code correctly.

    Note: If "NOT ALLOWED" appears after a few programming attempts, the
          access code has been changed or an error has occured and the phone
          will have to be returned to Nokia for repair.  (BUMMER!)

ENTER SPECIAL NAM PARAMETERS (Memory Location 01):

5.  Press and hold the [CLR] key until the display clears.
6.  In one long string, enter the special NAM parameters according to the
    format of Example 1 below.  Enter each emergency number (such as 911 or
    *911) followed by the pound (#) key, the Language Code followed by the
    asterisk (*) key, and the desired four digit lock code.
    Language Codes: 0 = English, 1 = French, 2 = Spanish.

    Note 1: Emergency numbers entered in memory location 01 can be used
            while call restrictions are active and when the phone is locked.
    Note 2: The first number entered in the list of emergency numbers is
            used for the Speed Dial (9) key.

Example 1:      Pound Key________________       _________Asterisk Key
                               \         \     /
                          9 1 1 # * 9 1 1 # 0 * 1 2 3 4
                            /         /      \      \_______Lock Code
        Emergency numbers__/_________/        \_________Language Code

7.  Enter [STO] 01 [STO].

ENTER MOBILE PHONE NUMBER (Memory Location 02 or 04):

8.  Press and hold the [CLR] key until the display clears.
9.  Enter the correct 10-digit phone number.

10.  For Primary NAM, enter [STO] 02 [STO].
     For Optional NAM, enter [STO] 04 [STO].

ENTER SYSTEM PARAMETERS (Memory Location 03 or 05):

11.  Press and hold the [CLR] key until the display clears.
12.  In one long string, enter the system parameters according to the
     format of Example 2 below.  Be sure to separate each parameter with
     an asterisk (*).  Do not place an asterisk before or after the string.

Example 2:  System ID_____                             ____Group ID Mark
                          \                           /
                         3 4 * 1 * 1 * 3 3 4 * 1 5 * 1 5
                              /   /       \      \
            Access Method____/   /         \      \_Access Overload Class
            Local Use Mark______/           \______Initial Paging Channel

13.  For Primary NAM, enter [STO] 03 [STO].
     For Optional NAM, enter [STO] 05 [STO].

VERIFY NAM INFORMATION:

14.  Press and hold the [CLR] key until the display clears.
15.  Use the up/down arrows to scroll through locations 01 through 05.
16.  Verify that the information for each memory location is correct.
17.  To exit the programming mode, power the phone off and then back on.
     If "NAM ERROR" appears on the display, programming was done
     incorrectly and must be repeated.

The above information was taken from the Nokia Programming Guide, and was
typed pretty much as it appears there.  The author assumes no responsibility
for any damages caused by any errors in the above information.  The above
information is for educational purposes only, and the author in no way
advocates the use of said information to defraud any cellular carrier.

HAVE PHUN!!!

                                Digital DNA
                            by abstract thought
                        (abstract@thought.dgsys.com)


     Life:=the state of an organism characterized by the capacity
           for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimulus, and
           reproduction.



     You may be wondering, why the meaning of life.  Well, I want
you to keep it in mind as you continue to read this article...


     Viruses.  Everyone is familiar with those little miscreant
programs infecting computers around the world.  They sometimes
consume files, cpu cycles, and other things we value, and the
almost always hinder productivity.  Rarely is a virus completely
eradicated as they are continually reproducing and inoculating
other files and computers.


     There is a reason why computer viruses are called viruses.  It
is because they are *exactly* like biological viruses.  Both are
incredibly small.  Where the biological viruses are at least half
as small as the cells they infect, digital viruses are similarly
smaller than the files they infect.  While viruses inject string os
protein called DNA into their host cells, their computer
counterparts inject strings of code, a digital DNA.  Later, those
host cells or programs spread their malevolent viruses to
neighboring targets.


     Now that the fact that biological viruses and digital viruses
are identical has been established, on to the big question.  Are
computer viruses, and other programs, alive?


     Viruses are one example.  The computer viruses meet the same
requirements for life that the biological ones do.  They have a
metabolism by consuming cpu cycles.  Growth is evident in their
infecting of programs, going from a small piece of code into a
healthy sized executable file.  Reaction to stimuli is evident in
many viruses.  For example, the diamond.105 virus infecting my
computer science disk.  The stimulus is being in memory for about
5 minutes, at which point a diamond of little ascii diamonds appear
and dance around consuming whatever is on the screen.  Reproduction
is hardly a question, there is no doubt that viruses reproduce.  So
in conclusion, viruses are alive.


     No, I'm not comparing computer viruses to humans.  Clearly,
life does not mean intelligence.  Computer viruses may be alive,
but they do lack intelligence, much like biological viruses.  And
no, they are not natural life.  They are as artificial as the
computers they inhabit.  But still, they are alive.


     Viruses are hardly the only life that programmers have
created.  In a local high school science fair there were two major
computer exhibits.  One was a simple program tracing genetic
material through a simulated colony.  Not exactly fulfilling the
requirements for life.  The other, however, was very interesting.
The project was a colony of competing creatures.  Each had their
own individual DNA coding that governed the way the moved and
reacted to stimulus.  They had a limited life span, based on
successful growth and metabolism.  As for reaction to stimuli, they
would avoid simulated poisons and consume the other life forms. 
This is another example of an artificial life form.


     Another popular trend in computer science is cellular
automata.  In one cellular automata, the life cycle began with a
clump of cells.  These cells would only survive if they could move
to a position neighboring two other cells.  Any more or any less
and the cell could possibly die.  The cells would react to
neighboring cells and find the best position to move to.  If they
lived long enough, they would be able to reproduce, thus sustaining
the colony.  Again, the qualities of life are shown in a program.


    Tom Ray, currently a scholar at the Advance Telecommunications
Research Institute International in Kyoto, Japan, is also convinced
that programs can live.  His reasoning...he breeds digital
organisms.  As a biologist, his initial intent was to study
evolution.  Evolution, however, is a long process, so he resorted
to creating his specimens.  After creating his own operating system
(so that if there are any escapee programs they won't work on other
computers), he introduced "the Ancestor".  The Ancestor was an 80-
byte long worm.  It was the first and last worm Ray ever created. 
After being set free on Tierra, the digital ecosystem/operating
system Ray created, the Ancestor bred and spread.  A 79-byte mutant
variation evolved and started to compete with it's predecessors. 
Later came 45-byte worm, then a 51, and the smallest, a 22-byte
creature.  Each worm had it's self-replicated brethren, each
competing for the necessary cpu cycles to live and reproduce.
However, something startling happened.  Symbiotic relationships
formed.  The 45 and 51-byte worms evolved into viruses lacking the
genetic code to reproduce.  They would infect the larger species
and use their code to reproduce.  In the process, the larger worms
would receive immunity from other parasites because they didn't
register in the memory.  These evolutionary powerhouses, with
tighter codes than most human programmers can dream of, have not
only shown the possibility for digital life, but a digital
ecosphere like the earth.  Tierra became a jungle of worms and
viruses competing, evolving, and living.  There is no doubt that
there is artificial life.


     Again, I'm not saying that programs are at the same level
humans or other organic life.  Yet, it would be hard to say that
some programs are not artificial life.  But that is my opinion, and
I would like to hear yours.  If have any thoughts, comments, or
ideas about this, tell me.  And if you agree or disagree, let me
know why, and if you have some examples, even better.  You can e-
mail me at abstract@thought.dgsys.com.  Maybe if the response is
great enough, I'll write a follow-up.  Hopefully you'll be seeing
more from me, on this topic or others.



     Lastly, I'd like to thank a few people.
       -Armitage, thanks for the chance to write this and for
          all the other things you've done for me.
       -All my friends in my computer science class...Brad, Aaron,
           Mark.  We had some good discussions about this and other
           fun things...
       -Everybody in the D.C. scene.  I learned a lot by watching
           you all... You may not have seen much of me but I      
          learned a lot from you.

This is _not_ the professional sounding announcement.  Use that one to con
your boss / employers out of the cost of the trip.  The professional
announcement will be available on the ftp site and other more serious mailing
lists and news groups, etc.  This is the k-RaD kriminal shout out to all u
el1te haquer types that aren't in jail to attend 'da def con.  werd.

What's this?  This is an initial announcement and invitation to DEF CON III,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Criminally Insane, Hearing Impaired.


WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never get to hear from some k-rad people.
WHEN:  August 4, 5, 6 - 1995 (Speaking on the 5th and 6th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Tropicana Hotel


So you heard about DEF CON II, and want to hit part III?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  You want to do weird shit _away_ from the hotel
where you could get me in trouble?  Then you're just the person to attend!


Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.  While there is an initial concern that this is just
another excuse for the evil hackers to party and wreak havoc, it's just
not the case.  People come to DEF CON for information and for making
contacts.  We strive to distinguish this convention from others in that
respect.  Plus this year we have official DEF CON GOONS(c) who will pummel
you until you pass out should you cause problems for other con.friendly
people!  Big Brother loves you!


What's been said (Only the good stuff will be quoted, of course)


  Stevyn - "Why can eye say, it was intense! . . . the whole con just kicked
  ass!  I totally recommend you check out the next one."


  Gail Thackeray, Prosecutor, "It's partly an entertaining party, it's
     partly a fashion statement.  But it's mostly something about which the
     business world has no clue."


  Wendy Murdock, Boardwatch, "Def Con represents the tug-of-war that has
     always been present - people strive to get that which is just out of
     reach, aggravating governments and breaking rules in the process."


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


WHERE IT IS:


The Tropicana has rooms reserved for the convention.  Rooms are expensive.
They are even more expensive if you don't book under the convention.  If it
is to expensive for you, please see the section below on Las Vegas www sites tha
t
can provide you with information on other nearby hotels that are cheaper.
Check-in is 3pm, check-out time is 12 noon.  Remember there is an 8% sales
tax in Vegas.


	       65$ Single or Double room, Midweek (Mon-Thurs)
	       90$ Single or Double room, Weekend (Fri-Sun)
	       350$ One-Bedroom Suite (Call for Availability)


     The Tropicana, 3801 Las Vegas Blvd. So., Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109
	  (702) 739-2581 or (800) 468-9494 or (702) 739-2448 (Fax)


Held in three conference rooms at the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas, DEF CON
promises to be interesting.  The Tropicana has a huge pool (largest in the
world?  Anyway, lots of cool movies have been filmed with this pool in them)
and in August Vegas should be about 100(f) degrees at one in the morning.
What do you care?  You'll be wired on caffeine and not sleeping anyway.  There
are numerous attractions in town from the strip bars to the local COs in case
you seek distraction.


The Tropicana is located right on the "Strip" with the other three corners of
the street occupied by the MGM Grand (Largest hotel in the world), the
Excalibur, and the Luxor (The big sense-net pyramid).  If you can afford it
I totally recommend spending some extra time in town.. there are too many
cool things to do, especially if you have never visited.  Heck, last time I
got to rent and fire uzi's and MP-5 machine guns (OK, so you can do that for
free in Los Angeles) see some strippers, and drink 1$ bottles of imported
beer.  What a place!  Now you know why I chose Vegas for a location.


			       SPECIAL EVENTS

				   SPEAKERS


This is a partial list of speakers for this year.  More are being invited
or waiting to make plans.  As this list changes further announcements will
be made.  This should give you a flavor or what to expect, though.


[> Winn Schwartau, Author of "Information Warfare" and "Terminal Compromise,"
   is a consultant to government and the private sector regarding enterprise
   and national security concerns.  TOPICS: "Information Warfare, the year
   in review" (Comedic) and "Tempest Attack Videos."

   "The Hacker Crackdown."  This will be his first chance to speak of his
   experiences without the threat of having his parole revoked.  TOPIC: To
   be decided later.


[> Chris Hall of Executive Protection will be demonstrating a fully
   equipped "A-Team" van, a fully loaded spy mobile with all types of cool
   interception and surveillance goodies.  Last year his talk included an
   overview of surveillance techniques.  TOPIC: To be decided later.

				 SPECIAL EVENTS


So you think you're so damn smart, eh?  Think your shit doesn't stink?
Right. Think you got one up on the Feds, huh?  Well, now's your chance to
prove it smarty-pants.   Winn Schwartau will take command and moderate.


			   ! A N N O U N C I N G !

			H A C K E R   J E O P A R D Y

That's right.  You can now prove how smart you really are.  Get up on stage
and question a few answers, pile up the points  . . . and win big!

You know the game.  You know the rules.  Now all you have to do is have the
guts, get up on stage in front of your peers and the narcs and show us all!

When?  After Dark Tangent's opening speech (which we're all really looking
forward to . . . [yawn]  HACKER JEOPARDY starts!


			 MIDNIGHT - DAY 1 of DEFCON.


If you wanna play . . . show up.  If you don't wanna play, don't show up.


There will be three rounds of three people.  Just like real. The winners of
each round will go into the Finals and the winner of that will win 25,000
units of some foreign currency!  From Dark Tangent himself!  Plus:

     - A t-shirt three sizes to small for the women
     - No t-shirts for the men.
     - Silk jackets for everyone.

Contestants will be picked at random from a pool of those who want to play.
If you don't wanna play, don't enter the contest.  Only the elite survive!


FEDS:  If you get picked to play, and we ask you what your job is, YOU HAVE
TO TELL THE TRUTH!  If you don't, our custom Fed-O-Meter will detect your
lies and off to the casinos you go!


Potential categories for questions include:


- - Famous Busts  - Famous Narcs  - UNIX Bugs  - Telco Tech  - "Hacking"
and beware of the killer daily double.  Bribing the judge is acceptable.


So, in the inimitable words of Al Bundy . . .  LET'S ROCK!



		       3rd ANNUAL SPOT THE FED CONTEST
			 Spot the fed, win the shirt


"Like a paranoid version of pin the tail on the donkey, the favorite sport
at this gathering of computer hackers and phone phreaks seems to be hunting
down real and imagined telephone security and Federal and local law
enforcement authorities who the attendees are certain are tracking their
every move.. .. Of course, they may be right."  John Markhoff, NYT


Basically the contest goes like this:  If you see some shady MB (Men in
Black) earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood to live and
die in L.A. type lurking about, point him out.  Just get my attention and
claim out loud you think you have spotted a fed.  The people around at the
time will then (I bet) start to discuss the possibility of whether or not a
real fed has been spotted.  Once enough people have decided that a fed has
been spotted, and the Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and informal vote
takes place, and if enough people think it's a true fed, or fed wanna-be,
or other nefarious style character, you win a "I spotted the fed!" shirt,
and the I.F. gets an "I am the fed!" shirt.


Note to the feds:  This is all in good fun, and if you survive unmolested
and undetected, but would still secretly like an "I am the fed!" shirt to
wear around the office or when booting in doors, please contact me when no
one is looking and I will take your order(s).  Just think of all the looks
of awe you'll generate at work wearing this shirt while you file away all
the paperwork you'll have to generate over this convention.  I won't turn in
any feds who contact me, they have to be spotted by others.



		       TELEPHONE CONFERENCE BRIDGE


For DEF CON III there will be a dial in conference set up.  If you are
overseas, or just too poor to make it to the convention this year, you can
still get an idea of what is going on and participate.  One part of the voice
conference equipment will allow you to listen to the convention room
microphone, another will allow you to ask questions during the Q&A sections
of peoples speeches.  A general conversation area will be up so you can chat
with others at the convention, or just others dialed into the bridge.


As more technical information and phone numbers become available for the
bridge I will post them in future convention updates.


Navigate through the voice mail maze and get free phone sex!  Impress others!


		     SPOOAH DOOPAH RAFFLE GIVE AWAY!@#


Throughout the convention, between speakers and events there will be a raffle
giveaway in which if your number is drawn, you win the prize.  Last year's
giveaway included an ancient kaypro monochrome portable, a roll of Sprint
"security" tape, "Computer Warriors" evil anti-virus cartoon, a 240 meg IDE
HD, and other elite things.


>> All the prizes given away are donated by other convention goers, so if  <<
>> you have any stuff to give away, please save and donate it to the con!  <<


		       RED BOX BUILDING CONTEST


While we don't encourage or condone the use of toll fraud devices, we do
encourage creativity and expression of thought.  We combine these and come
up with a red box creating contest.  The final device doesn't have to
produce the real red box tones (Can't have people getting arrested) BUT it
does have to produce some tones like with the stock crystal.  This contest
is inspired by last year's give away of a red box "Big Red" that looked just
like a big pack of Big Red gum, but really was a red box.  Elite!  There was
also a little girl's doll that was a red box, but the switch for that one was
hidden under the dress and, well, it just wasn't given away.


Come up with unique ideas!  With just a Hallmark card and some spare time you
can create an elite 007 style tone generating device!  What will you win if
yours is chosen as the most k-rad beside the envy of fellow hackers?  You'll
get a tee shirt and the cost of admission to the convention refunded PLUS
some as-of-yet undecided prize.  I bet you just can't wait to burn your
fingers with your soldering iron now!


				THE VIDEO ROOM


In one of the rooms a LCD wall projector will be hooked up connected to a
VCR, and people can bring flicts to play.  Stuff like Max Headroom, War Games
etc.  You know, the cool cheesy stuff.  Also some "hacker" videos will be
shown.  If you have something you wanna show, bring it along.  When the
projector is needed in the main conference room it will be swiped for the
duration.


				COOL VIDEO SHIT


At this time we are working to see if a T1 connection is possible.  If it is
there will be a cu-see me connection set up with multiple video cameras in
various locations.  Images will also be added automatically to a WWW page for
people to snag.  As all this works itself out there will be further
announcements.  No, there will be no "Hack our server" contests, and there
will be "Security Professionals" with "Diagnostic Tools" to "Correct" any
people who may case the network problems.


			       SCAVENGER CONTEST


A scavenger contest is being planned.  The person or group with the most
number of items on the list wins the prize.  (Prize undetermined as of yet)
and there will be a few follow up prizes.  Don't forget to carry massive
amounts of water as you run about the concrete jungle, dehydration can
happen just crossing the street.  This is a contest for only the most k-rad.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


			     WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP


DEF CON III will be planned right up until the last minute, with problems
being fixed and new things being added all along.. a sort of work in progress
that you get to witness in person when you show up.  Hopefully it won't be
too messed up when presented to the public.  What can you do to help?


- -> We are looking for people to speak on Personnel Information Gathering and
   selling.  Hopefully a speaker (who could remain anonymous) in this area
   has experiences in gathering and selling such information.  If you know
   of such a person, please invite them to contact me or let them know we
   are looking for such speakers.


- -> We are looking for some people to submit artwork to be used in the
   convention someplace.  It could be a poster, or in the program.  Black
   and white art would be eligible for the program only.


- -> Articles and interesting ftp sites, www pages, mini FAQs, etc. are all
   wanted for the program.  Quality articles that are informative and apply
   to the theme of the convention.  Scanner frequency lists,

		      WHY IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT SIGNED?


Well, last year it came to my attention that some unknown person in
California had modified an announcement and was having people mail their
pre-registration money to them instead.  It was actually pretty funny.  Only
one person was fooled and lost 10$.  Not bad.  I knew something was up when
he said he had pre-registered for 10$ and had the receipt I had supposedly
mailed back.  I am never that organized!  To avoid potential problems like
this one please verify this announcement!@#  My key is available for
verification on public key servers, and my key-id is 46A8294D.  The
other key you will find on servers may be my older 1284bit key, which is

                             Are You a Hacker?
                                by ReDragon

        Take a little quiz for me today.  Tell me if you fit this
description.  You got your net account several months ago.  You have been
surfing the net, and you laugh at those media reports of the information
superhighway.  You have a red box, you don't have to pay for phone calls.
You have crackerjack, and you have run it on the password file at a unix
you got an account on.  Everyone at your school is impressed by your computer
knowledge, you are the one the teachers ask for help.  Does this sound
like you?  You are not a hacker.
        There are thousands of you out there.  You buy 2600 and you
ask questions.  You read phrack and you ask questions.  You join
#hack and you ask questions.  You ask all of these questions, and you
ask what is wrong with that?  After all, to be a hacker is to question
things, is it not?  But, you do not want knowledge.  You want answers.
You do not want to learn how things work.  You want answers.  You do not
want to explore.  All you want to know is the answer to your damn
questions.  You are not a hacker.
        Hacking is not about answers.  Hacking is about the path you
take to find the answers.  If you want help, don't ask for answers,
ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out those answers
for yourself.  Because it is not the people with the answers that are
the hackers, it is the people that are travelling along the path.

                      Recent Large Name Phreaker Busts
                                by anonymous


February 22, 1995

Did you wake up that Wednesday and decide it was a good day to get raided?

Well, at least nine people had the pleasure of that experience.

Rumors were slow to circulate.  Even now, two weeks later, it's not clear to
anyone who exactly was raided, where, why, or if they had been arrested as
well.

One thing all the people have in common:  Southwestern Bell - or at the very
least, the desire and ability to hack all the switches on the west coast.

We know about Dispater (TEX), KC, Gatsby (and his girlfriend), Mark
Tabas, Dr DeLam, Zibby, Phantom Phreaker, and Zero Page.  While the
investigation seems to be based in Dallas, Texas, the people come from
different states: Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Washington, California,
and maybe Canada.  The primary suspect?  Zibby.  It's rumored the phreakers
had a good idea the raids were coming.

So what did the FBI do, and how long have they been monitoring these people?
Well, they have surveillance photos of some of the people involved.  Apparently
the fact that certain individuals had been together at some point in time
is very interesting.  Could they be fishing for a conspiracy charge, perhaps?
They seemed to be very interested in confiscating bank statements and so forth;
something to do with money laundering?  Cellular fraud is a given.  And of
course, consistency being something federal investigators are known for,
some cellular phones were taken, but _some_ were not.  Certain people were
threatened with indictments within two weeks; some were told they would
probably never be disturbed again.  One thing is for certain: their personal
possessions will be gone for a very long time, possibly forever.

A phone company employee was rumored to have stated, "it's not what
they did to the switches and such, it's HOW they did it".  An amusing
anecdote has been told about Dispater, "Supposedly he tried three times
to sell the CC numbers he had, and got ripped off every time!"  Apparently,
not everyone knew or approved of anyone making money off of their pursuits.
It's also rumored that phone calls were made overseas to military bases in
"hostile countries".

There's some question about what these raids have to do with other
recent events, such as the Kevin Mitnick arrest.  While at least one
of the people raided had connections to Mitnick, it appears that had
nothing to do with what happened on February 22.

                      Hacker learns intelligence secrets


-----gotten from RISKS Forum------

  Subject--Hacker learns intelligence secrets

The London "Independent" newspaper of 24-Nov-94 leads with a story
that a "hacker" gained access to a sensitive database of
telecommunications information at British Telecommunications (BT), the
UK's largest (and ex-state owned) carrier. The story was also carried
by all the major television and radio news programmes.

Tim Kelsey, author of the Independent story, reveals that details such
as telephone numbers and addresses for secret installations of the
Ministry of Defence, MI5 (the British intelligence agency responsible
for the UK) and MI6 (like MI5, but handles non-UK affairs).

"Thousands of pages of highly confidential BT records were sent across
the Internet to a young Scottish journalist, Steve Fleming, in July".
Mr Fleming received the information after making a news posting asking
for information on BT and hacking. The informant remained anonymous
--
details of how this was achieved are not given.

The hacker also gave details to Mr Fleming about how he too could
access the information. He applied through an employment agency for a
short-term contract at BT as a database designer, clearly stating on
his CV that he was a freelance journalist. He got the job, and was
able to gain access to the information because passwords were just
left lying around the office.

BT is still going through a major staff restructuring programme, and
as a result has a large number of temporary (contract) staff. These
staff need passwords to the system to legitimately carry out their
jobs, but because of the constant flow of people, the passwords are
often written down.

Mr. Fleming learned, among other things,

  *  The location of MI6's training centre ("spy school"), located in
     a non-descript building next to a pub in south London
  *  Information about the bunker in Wiltshire where the Government
      would go in the event of nuclear war
  *  Details of telephone installations at Buckingham Palace and 10
     Downing Street [the Prime Minister's home], including
     personal lines to John and Norma Major.

The system itself, the "Customer Services System", was designed and
implemented by an American company, Cincinnati Bell. It is supposed to
have internal mechanisms to prevent hacking (!)

So, what are the risks (briefly!)

	1) Allowing temporary staff passwords that allow almost any
	   data to  be retrieved. It sounds as if the security
	   levels of the database were either non-existent,
	    or compromised.
	2) Keeping sensitive information in the same database
	   as non-sensitive information.
	3) The age-old chestnut of the uses of passwords.

A BT spokesman, speaking on the "Today" programme on BBC Radio 4
confirmed that a "top level" investigation had been launched, but
refused to confirm or deny that the hack had taken place.

                                  OSS '94
                                 by firefly

      OSS '94 -- Third Annual Symposium on National Security
      And National Competitiveness -- Open Source Solutions

      In its third year of existence, and my second year of
      attendance, Open Source Solution's international 3-day
      conference is a mix of government, commercial, private
      citizens, and hackers joining together to discuss the
      implications of a National Knowledge Strategy. For those
      of you new to this series, OSINT (or OSCINT) is the
      intelligence technique of using public and unclassified
      data from any source to meet your intelligence needs. As
      I wrote in the first few segments in this column, this
      ranges from dumpster diving to CDROM databases to the
      Library of Congress to social engineering. If you've
      read my series, you know of Robert Steele. Hell, if you
      went to HOPE, you know him, he gave the elite keynote
      address with the flashing lights and all. Robert pulls
      together the best and brightest to speak and hold panel
      discussions at this conference.


      The affair lasted three days at the Raddison Hotel in
      Alexandria. It was an intense period, the first speaker
      started at 8am and they went thru until almost 5. Then
      came the daily networking reception where people could
      mingle, have some drinks and talk shop, and (last year)
      the few college seniors who were interning there could
      pass out resumes' and hope for jobs. Hey, it worked for
      me. OSS '94 boasted over 1000 attendees, 75 corporate
      sponsors, and 30 volunteers.


      I won't bore you with the details of the plenary sessions,
      but will tell you that some notable members of our side of
      the house were in attendance. Chris Goggans, Emmanuel, Bob
      Stratton, Rop Gongrijpp (sp?), and a few others headed up
      some of the panels on the pros/cons of hackers and the
      influence hackers (and those who know how to REALLY use
      computers in general) have on the ability of a company to
      get OSINT. Funny, these panels were PACKED with people --
      there was not even standing room. In the Goggans-Stratton
      panel, there were 150 people in a room designed for 50!
      On a side note, I think that the NASA Atlas of Mars is a
      new hacker item, as the NASA reps gave a copy to Emmanuel,
      me, and a few other hackers (more so to get rid of them,
      I think, but funny nevertheless as ONLY hackers took 'em)


      Some big speakers included: Ambassador Holmes, Assistant
      Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-
      Intensity Conflict (speaking about waging wars in the
      depths of cyberspace); Winn Schwartau, author of Terminal
      Compromise and INFOWAR (speaking about Information Warfare);
      Paul Fuchs, Director of the Red Cross (speaking about how
      OSINT and computers aid humanitarian operations); Loch
      Johnson, WELL-KNOWN author of intelligence books (speaking
      on the dark future of the CIA); and Robert Steele, who
      presented his Knowledge Strategy Thesis to the group.


      For you paranoid freaks, there were about 20-40 NSA people
      in the crowd, identified by the cryptic nametag that said
      only "Department of Defense". Hmmm. They hung around by
      themselves in their own little cliques. Very few spoke to
      anyone else. Kind of makes you wonder what it would be to
      work for the Big Bruiser of Fort Meade. I dunno. I like to
      interact with people, not just PCs, codewheels, and Never
      Say Anything.


      OSS is an international event, and the premise behind it is
      just as large. Robert Steele's basis for forming Open Source
      Solutions is to not only provide cost-effective information
      to whoever needs it (government or private sector), but to
      illuminate the expanding global connections and essentially
      publicize the Power of Information.


      Steele professes the need to "Restructure and Reinvent
      Intelligence". For those who don't know, intelligence is not
      CIA stuff. It's simple information. Yes, CIA uses information
      and puts a TOP SECRET classification on it. That's where
      Steele goes nuts. He says that (and I agree with him) that by
      using open sources, one can obtain better information/intelligence
      than by only using Spooky Secret Spy Stuff, and at a VERY SMALL
      FRACTION of the cost. It costs more to classify and manage this
      classified information than it does to look for the same stuff
      through open sources.


      Overall, OSS '94 was a bounding success. If anyone is interested
      in OSINT, feel free to contact me at firefly@cult.empire.org or
      at other well-known non-government addresses.
